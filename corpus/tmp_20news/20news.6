From : jemurray @ magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu ( John E Murray ) Subject : quality of Catholic liturgy Organization : The Ohio State University Lines : 37 I would like the opinion of netters on a subject that has been bothering my wife and me lately : liturgy , in particular , Catholic liturgy . In the last few years it seems that there are more and more ad hoc events during Mass . It's driving me crazy ! The most grace-filled aspect of a liturgical tradition is that what happens is something we _all_ do together , because we all know how to do it . Led by the priest , of course , which makes it a kind of dialogue we present to God . But the best Masses I 've been to were participatory prayers . Lately , I think the proportion of participation has fallen , and the proportion of sitting there and watching , or listening , or generally being told what to do ( which is necessary because no one knows what 's happening next ) is growing . Example . Last Sunday ( Palm Sunday ) we went to the local church . Usually on Palm Sunday , the congregation participates in reading the Passion , taking the role of the mob . The theology behind this seems profound -- when we say '' Crucify him '' we mean it . We did it , and if He came back today we 'd do it again . It always gives me chills . But last week we were `` invited '' to sit during the Gospel ( =Passion ) and _listen_ . Besides the Orwellian `` invitation '' , I was really saddened to have my ( and our ) little role taken away . This seems typical of a shift of participation away from the people , and toward the musicians , readers , and so on . New things are introduced in the course of the liturgy and since no one knows what 's happening , the new things have to be explained , and pretty soon instead of _doing_ a lot of the Mass we 're just sitting there listening ( or spacing out , in my case ) to how the Mass is about to be done . In my mind , I lay the blame on liturgy committees made up of lay '' experts '' , but that may not be just . I do think that a liturgy committee has a bias toward doing something rather than nothing -- that 's just a fact of bureaucratic life -- even though a simpler liturgy may in fact make it easier for people to be aware of the Lord 's presence . So we 've been wondering -- are we the oddballs , or is the quality of the Mass going down ? I do n't mean that facetiously . We go to Mass every Thursday or Friday and are reminded of the power of a very simple liturgy to make us aware of God 's presence . But as far as the obligatory Sunday Masses ... maybe I should just offer it up : ) Has anyone else noticed declining congregational participation in Catholic Masses lately ? John Murray

Between Adam and Eve and Golgotha the whole process of the fall of man occurred . This involved a gradual dimming of consciousness of the spiritual world . This is discernable in the world outlooks of different peoples through history . The Greek , for example , could say , `` better a beggar in the land of the living than a king in the land of the dead . '' ( Iliad , I think ) . The question of what happens to human beings who died before Christ is an ever present one with Christians . I am not ready to conscign Adam or Abraham , or even Cain to eternal damnation . Yet they all died in their sins , in the Christian sense . The same can be said of the whole of Gentile humanity , and also of the unrepentant malefactor on the cross next to him . I do not limit the power of Christ to save even him , through whom Satan would mock his deed of salvation at the very moment of its fulfillment . > In my studies > of the ancient mystery reliegions , I have run across many poems or rituals or > what nots with the interpretation that those who are of God will be with Him > via the promised seed but those who rebel will suffer *eternal* life in dieing . > It was a standard belief back then . It is possible to experience eternity in a passing moment . The relationship of eternity to duration is not simply one of indefinitely extended conditions of Greenwich mean time . It is possible to imagine an eternity of agony or bliss - or even many of them - in the spiritual world during the time between earthly death and a new birth . It was also a standard belief among many peoples that even the righteous were lost . This again is the result of the loss of the paradisal consciousness that fled from us after the fall , with our ever increasing involvement with the sense world . It would be interesting to share in the results of your studies of ancient people 's ideas of life after death . > Today we think we know so much and that > if we could go back in time we could sure teach those people a thing or two . > But I think that as this age has grown older that it is we who opperate from a > mist , not those of the older ages . > Mankind fell into mist and darkness , and at `` the turning point of time '' a new light entered into the world . The light still grows , and we are developing the eyes with which to see by it . Much new revelation and growth in under- standing lies before us . Our new vision and understanding is still very feeble , but it contains something new that will grow in time to embrace that which is old and much more as well . ( At this point I should acknowledge openly my debt to the work of Rudolf Steiner , founder of Anthroposophy , for many insights that have led me to my views on this subject ) . > I have said it before , I 'd love to post on this but the vulcan hammer would > fall .

THe writings and the archeological > finds plainly show its origin and the whys and wherefores of this doctine . The way you refer to it as `` doctrine '' puts a modern intellectual coloring on it . I think it was much less abstract and much more real and spiritually concrete , a teaching that struck much closer to home than our doctrines or teachings today can be received . I am not so ready to attribute widespread notions in antiquity to simple dispersion from an original source . Even if they were passed on , the question is , to what extent did they reflect real perception and experience ? The similarity in the midst of great variety of expression of the different people 's ideas of the time immediately after death testifies to the presence of an underlying reality . In any case , we study geometry not by reading old manuscripts of Euclid , but by contemplating the principles themselves . On the other hand , there is one notion firmly embedded in Christianity that originated most definitely in a pagan source . The idea that the human being consists essentially of soul only , and that the soul is created at birth , was consciously adopted from Aristotle , whose ideas dominated Christian thought for fifteen hundred years and still does today . He was at once the father of modern thought and at the same time lived during that darkened time when the perception of our eternal spiritual being had grown dim . > maybe at sometime in the future- Indeed . I should also clarify that I do not deny that eternal irrevocable damnation is a real possibility . But the narrow range in which we conceive of the decisive moment , i.e . after the end of a single earthly life , is not in my mind sufficient to embrace the reality , and I think that is why the early creeds were couched in terms that did not try to spell it out . > Rex Gerry ( 73237.2006 @ compuserve.com )

Now , this is scripture . By your definition , > this is truth and therefore absolute . Hold it . I said that all of scripture is true . However , discerning exactly what Jesus , Paul and company were trying to say is not always so easy . I do n't believe that Paul was trying to say that all women should behave that way . Rather , he was trying to say that under the circumstances at the time , the women he was speaking to would best avoid volubility and cover their heads . This has to do with maintaining a proper witness toward others . Remember that any number of relativistic statements can be derived from absolutes . For instance , it is absolutely right for Christians to strive for peace . However , this does not rule out trying to maintain world peace by resorting to violence on occasion . ( Yes , my opinion . ) > Evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture > to be absolute truth . ( And there are plenty of other examples . ) > Can you reconcile this ? Sure . The Bible preaches absolute truths . However , exactly what those truths are is sometimes a matter of confusion . As I said , the Bible does preach absolute truths . Sometimes those fundamental principles are crystal clear ( at least to evangelicals ) . Sometimes they are not so clear to everyone ( e.g . should baptism be by full immersion or not , etc ) . That is largely because sometimes , it is not explicitly spelled out whether the writers are speaking to a particular culture or to Christianity as a whole . This is where scholarship and the study of Biblical contexts comes in . > It 's very difficult to see how you can claim something which is based > on your own *interpretation* is absolute .

This makes sense ( radar pointed down ) , because almost every train I pass head-on that triggers my radar detector does so more just after I have passed the front of the engine . I get a little of the reflections as I am approaching and the instant I get to the side of the first engine the detector receives a fairly strong signal for a short time .

Researchers have found that eating a cup of yogurt a day drastically reduces a woman 's chances of getting vaginal candida , a yeast infection . For the year-long study , researchers at Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park , New York , recruited 13 women who suffered from chronic yeast infections . For the first 6 months , the women each day ate 8 ounces of yogurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus . For the second 6 months , the women did not eat yogurt . The researchers examined the women each month and found that incidents of colonization and infection were significantly lower during the period when the women ate yogurt . The fungus Candida albicans can live in the body without doing harm . It is an overproliferation of the fungus that leads to infection . The researchers concluded that the L. acidophilus bacteria found in some brands of yogurt retard overgrowth of the fungus . Streptococcus thermophilus and L. bulgaricus are the two bacteria most commonly used in commercial yogurt production . Neither one appears to exert a protective effect against Candida albicans , however . Women who want to try yogurt as a preventive measure should choose a brand that lists acidophilus in its contents . -- - end -- - =================================== InfoTrac - Health Reference Center ~ Oct '89 - Oct '92 THE MATERIAL CONTAINED IN Health Reference Center ~ Oct '89 - Oct '92 IS PROVIDED ONLY FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS MEDICAL ADVICE OR INSTRUCTION .

In some circumstances , though , the organisms proliferate , producing symptomatic infection of the mouth , intestines , vagina , or skin . When the mouth or vagina are infected , the disease is commonly called thrush . Vaginitis caused by Candida often afflicts women on birth control pills or antibiotics . There is itching and a white , cheesy discharge . Among narcotic addicts , Candida infections can lead to heart valve inflammation . Diagnosis of Candida infections is confirmed by cultures and blood tests . Treatment can be with amphotericin B or orally with ketoconazole . There is no evidence that Candida in the intestine of normal individuals leads to disease . All people at one time or another have Candida in their intestines .

ATT 's last product in this area ( a ) was priced over $ 1000 , as I suspect 'clipper ' phones will be ; ( b ) came to the customer with the key automatically preregistered with government authorities . Thus , aside from attempting to further legitimize and solidify the fed 's posture , Clipper seems to be `` more of the same '' , rather than a new direction . Yes , technology will eventually drive the cost down and thereby promote more widespread use- but at present , the man on the street is not going to purchase a $ 1000 crypto telephone , especially when the guy on the other end probably does n't have one anyway .

If amnesty was their concern , they should pay in cash rather than moneyorder and they should check to see if the gun turned in was stolen or not . This way if a gun turns out to be stolen , then even if they wanted to prosecute , they do n't know who to prosecute . Since the only concern of these ( HCI and the like ) people seems to be the total eradication of guns ( legal or illegal ) , why should they bother to check for stolen property . If they knew who the rightful owner is , then they would have to return the gun and hence contrary to their intent to ban all guns .

Part of what started this was my earlier example of Illinois , USA requiring anyone doing more than X automobile transfers a year ( X = 10 , I think ) to become licensed as a used car dealer . In addition , it requirs anyone with a used car dealer 's license to own at least 10 cars at a time , all the time . Let me continue with this example and try to answer Steve 's questions . Steve , let 's say you have the talent and inclination to fix up and resell cars . Either you 've gotten good enough at it in your spare time to bump up against these limits , or you would like to do it full-time but these stupid , arbitrary laws prevent you from starting out small and pulling yourself up . So I 'm protected from a hungry neighborhood competitor willing to take a low profit while working extra hard to fulfill my needs , and you're protected from doing what you want with your life . Here 's what I see libertarianism offering you : Your money is truly yours ; it belongs to you . You can use it to buy a car . If you use it to buy a car , it is truly your car ; it belongs to you . You can use your money to fix up that car . Since it is your car , you can sell that car . Your life is truly yours ; it belongs to you . It matters not if someone thinks that it 's `` wrong '' for you to buy and sell 10 cars within 12 months rather than , say , 9 cars . They may dissaprove , but it is not their life or their money , it is your life and your money . My money is truly mine ; it belongs to me . I can use it to buy a car . Perhaps your car . Perhaps that 10th car , the one that someone , somewhere dissaproves of you selling and , presumably , of me buying . That someone could go to the government and insist that the government make us stop it . But the government would be powerless to stop us from doing what we like with our own property , in the abscence of fraud or agression . And it would be powerless to stop us from associating with each other . This does not seem to me to be a utopian dream , but basic human decency and common sense . A real grass-roots example of freedom and liberty . And yes , not having a few people acting as our masters , approving or rejecting each of our basic transactions with each other , does strike me as a wonderful way to improve the human condition . Thanks awfully , Patrick

I will also leave it up to other LDS netters to take Mr. Weiss to task on using Mormon Doctrine to declare the difinitive word on what the LDS Church teaches as doctrine . Hopefully the LDS netters will be amiable in their explanation . ) Since it would do no good to rebut what Mr. Weiss has stated on the origin of the Nicene Creed and its status as devine and inspired ( I say `` no good '' because it can not be proved through discussion or debate as to whether or not the authors of the Creed were inspired ) , I leave you ( it will be some time before I post again ) with the following thought authored by Eugene England , Professor of English at Brigham Young University . Mr. England wrote the following as part of a book review section in This People 's magazine ( Spring 1993 edition ) : `` I conclude with a little sermon because I believe we will not be a Mormon -- or human -- family until we can get over labeling and rejecting each other with terms like feminist or patriarchal , liberal or conservative ( Christian or non-Christian -- Hal 8^ ) . When we are tempted to draw a circle around a set of beliefs and traditions and styles and call it American , then exclude those who do n't fit , it may be well to consider that perhaps the most central defining characteristic of a good American might be `` one who does n't draw exclusive circles '' -- that the surest way of excluding ourselves from the central American ideal is by excluding others . And when we are tempted to draw a circle around `` Mormon '' or `` Christian , '' to decide who is `` orthodox '' and who is n't by how much they agree with us , it might be well to consider that the central pillar of Christ 's `` orthodoxy '' is our ability to love unconditionally those who are different and include them in our family . `` I recently spent some time in a `` Christian '' bookstore in California . The service was excellent , the clerks and customers all smiling , neat , and well-scrubbed , and there were the expected wholesome offerings of scriptural commentaries , sentimental fiction , and collections of evangelistic sermons . But I was dismayed to find how much shelf space was given to attacking others , often viciously -- -whether the political left , our modern American culture , or other religions . A whole section was devoted to `` Cults and the Occult , '' and as you might expect , Mormonism was right there under the same rubric and indictment ( often by the same authors ) as Satanism . And I found I could either rent or buy ( in English or Spanish ) copies of The God Makers ( that absurdly inaccurate , even libelous , but very popular and dangerous anti-Mormon film that uses exaclty the same techniques and even accusations of the Nazi films that scapegoated Jews in the 1930s ) . `` It seems to me one major indication that a person is a genuine convert to Christ and his redemptive love is his lack of paranoia and anxiety ( `` Perfect love casteth out fear , '' I John 4:18 ) . I have always been pleased that the LDS Church has not engaged in attacks on other faiths , though I find a disheartening increase in willingness of individual Mormons to engage in the same kinds of stereotyping and scapegoating -- -and even threats of coercive action -- -as the `` religious right wing '' has launched this year against the political left and American cultural and religious styles they do n't like . It is a fearful irony that in so doing Mormons take common cause with the very people who have most slanderously attacked Mormons -- -people who would , if they had power , forcefully restrict Mormons ' rights along with those of others they believe to be evil . '' The above `` sermon '' was addressed to the LDS audience who usually subscribe to This People 's magazine , but would certainly apply to all of us who rely on the mercies and grace of Jesus Christ to bring us back into His arms . Even though the LDS Church claims devine authority to exercise the principles of the restored gospel -- -as in the days of Christ , the Church does not claim perfection and infallibility in how those with authoritative status have or do now lead the Church . I , for one , do not wish to be labelled `` Christian '' , if those who profess themselves as Christians attack my beliefs because they are intollerent ( for example ) of the way my religion may interpret Biblical scriptures of the same source to have a different meaning and implication than mainstream Christianity would give it . Once again , being in the majority does NOT in and of itself PROVE anything except that your collective voice is louder . That 's really all the critics of the LDS Church have to stand on in terms of the kind of Biblical interpretation used as proof to counter the LDS Church ' interpretation ! Using someone elses biased research of truths and non-truths ( whose to say what the mixture is ? ) as an authoritative tool to disprove or discredit is not being fair to anyone , least of all themselves . Let us simply agree to disagree , and share beliefs through adult discussion and conversation , thereby uplifting everyone . Hal Leifson -- signing off !

I > think the usual analysis would be that sin is not part of the basic > definition of humanity . It 's a consequence of the fall . Jesus is > human , but not a fallen human . -- clh ] The proper term for what Mike expresses is Monophysitism . This was a heresy that was condemned in the Council of Chalcedon in 451 AD . It grew up in reaction to Nestorianism , which held that the Son and Jesus are two different people who happened to be united in the same body temporarily . Monophysitism is held by the Copts of Egypt and Ethipoia and by the Jacobites of Syria and the Armenian Orthodox . It believes that Jesus Christ was God ( which is correct ) , that he was man ( which is correct ) , that he was one person ( which is correct ) , but that he had only one nature and one will and oen energy ( which is heretical , the orthodox position is that he had two natures and two wills and two energies , both divine and human , though the wills were in perfect harmony ) . That is what Mike is trying to get across , that while Jesus came in human form , Mike says He did not have a human nature or a human will . In reality , he had both , though neither made him subject to original sin . It is interesting to note that the Monothelites were a reaction to this conflict and attempted to solve the problem by admitting two natures but not two wills or two energies . It also was condemned , at a late council in Constantinople I believe . Andy Byler [ These issues get mighty subtle . When you see people saying different things it 's often hard to tell whether they really mean seriously different things , or whether they are using different terminology . I do n't think there 's any question that there is a problem with Nestorius , and I would agree that the saying Christ had a human form without a real human nature or will is heretical . But I 'd like to be a bit wary about the Copts , Armenians , etc . Recent discussions suggest that their monophysite position may not be as far from orthodoxy as many had thought . Nestorius was an extreme representative of one of the two major schools of thought . More moderate representatives were regarded as orthodox , e.g . Theodore of Mopsuestia . My impression is that the modern monophysite groups inherit the entire tradition , not just Nestorius ' version , and that some of them may have a sufficient balanced position to be regarded as orthodox . -- clh ]

From the limited details released so far , It seems that the clipper chip system must employ some sort of public key cryptography . Otherwise , the key management problems inherent to symetric ciphers would make the system unworkable . It probably has some sort of public key exchange that takes place at the start of each call . Thats how they would identify the private key in their data base ? This means that either the NSA has developed some non RSA public key algorythm or the feds have decided to subsidize PKP & RSADSI . The former is rather an exciting posibility since keeping the algorythm secret while making chip implimentations widely avalibe will be exceptionally hard . If the feds are forced to make it avalible in order to gain public acceptance than that could break RSA 's stranglehold on public key crypto in the U.S. As for my impressions of the whole scheme It seems that instead of trying to ban strong crypto , they are trying to co-opt it . Their contention that they need to keep the algorythm secret to protect the security of the key registration suggests possible inherent weakness to the algorythm . More likely is that they dont want anyone constructing black market devices which dont have the keys registered . Anyone else notice that in their Q & A session , they talk about releasing the keys only to people with proper autiorization but carefully dance around stating that the keys will simply have to be supeonaed . They seem to be trying to keep open the posibility of obtaining keys without court order even though tapping a phone line requires one . Also pick up on their implicit threat of eithe accept this or we 'll ban strong crypto outright ? I dont trust this plan at all and plan to oppose it in all ( legal ) ways possible . Bill Smythe

Au , I have to disagree regarding your assessment of Macintosh in Hong Kong . The Mac has a sizeable share of the typesetting market , as in the U.S. A local magazine , Next Magazine ( similar to Newsweek here ) , uses the Mac extensively . I have seen Sir Speedy and other franchises in Hong Kong equipped with Mac-based systems . True , the discount is not as steep as here because customers in Hong Kong can not buy from gray market , nor are Mac being sold thru mass merchandisers like Apple does here with the Performa lin e. At this point the sale of Mac is handled by one exclusive distributor . On the other hand , you can always get a PC clone or in the earlier days , illegal clones of the Apple IIe . Your perception of the Mac not being too popular in Hong Kong is simply because most hobbyists and users find it much cheaper to go to one of those basement stores that sell PC clones with probably illegal copies of BIOS than to pay for a Mac . Similarly you can not say Lotus 1-2-3 surely is not well accepted in Hong Kong because the sale is so low . May be it is because of all those places in Kowloon where illegal copies of Lotus 1-2-3 can be bought for $ 20 and $ 10 for a professional looking but illegal copies of the manuals . -- =*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*= Eric Choi - Internet : Eric.Choi @ p5.f175.n2240.z1.fidonet.org

Well SCSI is ALSO a FLOPPY drive interface . In the Mac { since SCSI is THE inteface for any non-card , non-modem , not-keyboard device } the id 7 is used for the floppy drive { called CPU in all identifiers . } This allows cross drive interfacing as fast as the OS , program , CPU , SCSI , and drive can handle it { this shows up best in the Quatra line } . In the IBM that uses SCSI for the FLOPPY drive this should happen as well . Also SCSI is NOT just drives but printers , scanners , expandsion cards { this showed up for the Plus as the NuBus 'Cage ' } , CD-ROM , etc . IDE seems to be mainly hard drives . As for specs nobody has GIVEN me any and I ca n't find any . Besides the advertizments call IDE the AT interface { Make of that what you will } SCSI is a jack of all trades and IDE is a master of ONE . This alone puts SCSI above IDE . SCSI-2 blows IDE out of the water . Remember SCSI was used in high priced machines until about 18 months ago { When the Mac prices came down to Earth } so the Rule of Scale still played and SCSI remained high cost { cheap seems to mean chezzy in the High end computer world at times and THIS more than anything else proably kept SCSI off into the statosphere price wise } SCSI came FROM the high end computer world with multitasking OS were the standard for the most part . Of all the interface NeXT could have used it choose SCSI . In 16-bit and 32-bit mode SCSI is a multi-tasking OS desined interface while IDE and 8-bit SCSI are braindead run one program interfaces { at least the way mac use 8-bit SCSI.UGH }

Did the FBI offer them a supply of water when the BD pump stoped working ? Did the permit Koresh to communicate with anyone outside the compound ? What the FBI did was harass the Branch Davidians as much as possible . They kept powerful lights shining on the compound , shut off their electrical power , put their pump out of action , assaulted their ears with loud noise , cut off their communication with the outside and kept limiting their permitter . The stated goal was to put pressure on David Koresh . Was the FBI attempting to get Koresh to surrender or were they hoping to get Koresh so mad that he and some of his followers would attack the the tanks . It appears that the tactics employed by the FBI did drive Koresh over the edge . The blame for the deaths should be shared by both the federal experts whose tactics drove Koresh over the edge and the fools at the ATF who planed the raid . Stupidity and incompetence of the BATF and the FBI leadership have resulted in the needless death of 90 innocent people . If every thing had gone as planned 90 people would be alive today .

From : lansd @ dgp.toronto.edu ( Robert Lansdale ) Subject : Advice sought : Turning font outlines into renderable polygons Organization : CSRI , University of Toronto Distribution : na Lines : 53 I am seeking some alternate solutions on how to turn a Postscript Type 1 or TrueType font outline into polygons that can be subsequently scan converted by a 3D scanline renderer . I have been studying the problem of font conversion for a few years but have never had the need to implement such a system . Well , I now have the opportunity to write some font rendering software so I would like to have some of my questions answered before I jump into the deep end . The main problem I face is how to use the even/odd or non-winding rules to turn the outlines into a single outline polygon ( my renderer can handle complex polygons so there is no need to reduce the polygons to simple polygons ) . For example , in the letter `` O '' there are two outlines : 1 ) The outside outline which is clockwise ( TrueType font ) 2 ) The inside outline which is counterclockwise . One common solution used by a number of rendering packages is to simply connect the inner outline to the outer outline at the point where the two outlines are closest . This is equivalent to descibing a `` polygon with holes '' . The renderer will then make the appropriate hole since the interior polygon edges are in the opposite direction to the outside edges . I do not want to use this simplistic system since : 1 ) It will not handle all outline fonts properly ( it is not a simple matter to connect the outer outline to the inner outline for some fancy fonts ) . 2 ) It does not properly handle the even/odd or non-winding rules . From my research over the years the proper solution is to use a trapezoid decomposition algorithm to scan convert the outlines into trapezoids ( as is done by the Postscript and TrueType font rasterizers ) . These trapezoidal polygons can then be easily and properly rendered by the 3D scanline renderer . My question is : are there any better solutions to turning the outlines into polgyons other than the trapezoid decomposer ? I am not fond of this solution since it creates excess number of polygons . Another question , for those in the know : what is the best algorithm to create bevelled and/or offset curves for font outlines ? I have a dozen papers on these subjects but I ca n't tell which method is the best to implement .

By such a back- door ( in the encryption algorithm perhaps ) it would be possible ( for the manufacturer ) to get the keys of all chips that were programmed in one session .

From : wellison @ kuhub.cc.ukans.edu Subject : Re : Help with ultra-long timing Organization : University of Kansas Academic Computing Services Lines : 33 Thanks for the resposes as they were all good ideas and I am looking at using a couple of the ideas . I recieved in the mail today the spec sheets on the mil . spec version of Exar 's XR-2240 timer/counter chip . It is stable down to -50 C and sucks very little power . They show an application for a ultra-long time delay ( up to several years depending on the RC time constant ) . In this application , they have two of them cascaded together . The reset and trigger pins of both chips are tied together and the timebase of the second chip is disabled . In this configuration , the output is high when the system is reset . When triggered , the output goes low and stays that way for a total of 65,536 x the timing cycle of the first chip . The total timing cycle of the two chips can be programmed from To = 256 x R x C to 65,536 x R x C in 256 steps by selecting any combination of the counter outputs to the timer output . The beauty of it is , the timebase chip would only have to have a 100uF timing cap and a 391K resistor for 39.1 seconds per timing cycle . So I can get a maximum of 2,562,457.6 seconds between timing cycles ( 39.1 x 65,536 or about 29 days ! ) Of course , that 's much more than I need ( 14 days ) . But the counter allows for 256 binary steps that can be selected for the output for the 'pellet puker ' . After the first 14 days and it trips , it would reset its self for the next 14 day timing cycle and so forth . Power is still a problem though . A few ideas that you suggested was to bury the electronics in a hole dug in the snow ( as an insulator ) and put the pellet puker up on a tower above the estimated snow fall with a solar panel on it to keep a charge on a lithium battery pack . I like that idea ; - ) This thing has to work for at least six weeks for three samples and the gas valves are 12 volts to spit the pellets out onto the snow . Anyway , I ordered the XR-2240 's to see what I can do with them . Should be interesting ( as long as I 'm not the one that has to go digging up the pellets in the middle of Antartica freezing my buns off ; - ) Thanks again everyone ... -=-= Wes =-=-

From : kennejs @ a.cs.okstate.edu ( KENNEDY JAMES SCOT ) Subject : Drug Use Up Among U.S. Eighth-graders Organization : Oklahoma State University , Computer Science , Stillwater Keywords : youths drugs LSD inhalants Lines : 87 The article that follows was taken from the Wednesday , April 14 , 1993 issue of USA Today ( `` Drug Use Up Among U.S. eighth-graders '' by Mike Snider , p. 6D ) . A new national survey says drugs are easier to get , more teens are using them and fewer deem drug use as risky . For the last two years , government officials have trumpeted results from the National High School Survey as signs that the drug war is being won . But this year , officials are retreating - drug use by eighth-graders has risen , according to the survey of 50,000 students nationwide . Possible reason for the increase : more experimentation . Why ? If drug use dropped during the '80s , eventually some students will have fewer `` drug-using contemporaries '' who act as examples of substance abuse 's drawbacks , says social psychologist Lloyd Johnston , one of the survey authors . Each new wave of youths `` must be given the knowledge , skills and motivation to resist using these drugs , '' Johnston says . This type of resurgence `` is possible , '' says Eileen Shiff , author of `` Experts Advise Parents '' ( Delta , $ 14.95 ) . But that 's not the issue , she says . The prevalence of alcohol and drugs among teens today could result in more alcoholic adults decades from now . Aggravating the problem : baby boomer parents - who experimented with drugs and alcohol as teens - trying to be friends , not parents , to their children . `` I 've even seen parents serving kegs of beer '' to their underage kids and friends , Shiff says . For a recent graduation , Shiff and other parents organized an all-night , `` lock-in '' party where no booze or drugs were allowed . `` We need to fulfill that parental role , otherwise the peer group takes over , '' she says . Officials may `` talk about the war on drugs , but they really haven't done anything that I 've seen , '' says Suzanne Linkous , Scottsdale , Ariz. , 16 , a volunteer who talks with teens about drugs , dating and other issues on a peer counseling and suicide hot line . Linkous , a member of USA Today 's Teen Panel , says `` there 's always going to be experimentation '' with drugs . A real war on drugs could be waged `` education-wise , '' she says . But `` some do n't want to give kids the facts . They think it will give them ideas ; it 's the same with birth control . I think you should give the kids the information or have it accessible '' through classes , pamphlets and speakers , she says . Education efforts need to start as soon as kids get in school - in kindergarten , says Dallas Owens , 17 , teen panelist from Miami Shores , Fla. `` I remember in kindergarten , I used to see ( drugs ) . I think kids in the 10th and 12th grades have already made up their minds ( about using drugs ) , '' he says . Scare tactics in public service announcements are n't working ; only one commercial has gotten it right , he says . The commercial opens with two `` good-looking girls '' in the restroom talking about having no prom date . Then they take a hit off a joint . `` That hits home because it 's not attractive , '' he says . `` You ca n't be doing drugs if you want somebody to like you .

Subject : Re : Stop putting down white het males . From : < RIPBC @ CUNYVM.BITNET > Organization : City University of New York Lines : 31 From : baba @ Tymnet.com ( Duane Hentrich ) -BTW , I 'm a WALC ( white aryan lapsed catholic ) - -- - -d'baba Duane M. Hentrich baba @ Tymnet.Com - I would like to go on record as objecting to Mr. Hentrich calling himself an Aryan . The word ` Aryan ' is of Sanskrit origin and occurs first in the Hindu scripture , the Rigveda . It seems to have been a tribal term but may have had connotations of good character . Such connotations are quite explicit in the sayings of the Buddha who called his religion the eightfold Aryan path . The word was borrowed by the German scholar Max Mueller who used it as a synonym for ` indo-european ' , but then the Nazis proceeded to steal it and started pretending that ` aryan ' is synonymous with ` nordic ' which seems highly unlikely . The people who originally called themselves aryas , the Iranians , Noprth Indians , the Afghans and possibly the Kurds , are none of them nordic . So the use of the word by Westerners , though meant with apparent good humor in this case , is nontheless inappropriate . The only Westerners who may have some claim to call themselves Aryans ( by descent ) are the Celts who seem to have wor- shipped a god called Aryaman who is mentioned in the Rigveda . If you want to check what I am saying , look at Mallory 's book , `` In search of the Indo-Europeans '' or , just look at the Encyclopedia Britannica . The reason this usage is offensive is that most of Ancient Indian literature as well as religion is directly or inderectly due to the Aryans and for Westerners to butt in is really not nice , not to mention the horrible things done by Germans to Jews , using a word to which the Germans have no clear claim .

Recognizing that most of the military requirements for launch vehicles are pulled out of a hat somewhere ( say , has the shuttle ever really used that 1200mi crossrange capability ? You get the idea , figure out how many , how often , where to , etc ... ) Then taking this data , and forming a sematech type company ( bad example , I know ... but at least its an example ... ) To develop between 3 and 5 craft designs . Then to take all of those designs , and figure out EXACTLY what the technologies are , and demonstrate those technologies , in order to eliminate designs that ca n't be built today . And lets say that this portion again funded by the GOV cost about $ 20 million . And from here all of these companies went their separate ways , with the intention of taking all of the market data and the design data to wall street , and saying `` I want to build this vehicle , and here are the numbers that show % 20 ROI , fund me ... ) Now many of you think that this is a joke , but I have it on good authority that just this project is shaping up in the background . It seems that the aerospace companies have learned that everyone yelling similar but different things ends up in many programs that do nothing much and get canceled ( NASP , NLS , ALS , DCY ? , etc ... ) They need to work more in the japaneese , and european spirit of initial cooperation . They have also learned that design requirements that are phony ( I.E . some generals idea of what a space vehicle ought to be ) ends up getting chopped up in congress , because it is not a REAL requirement .

If the gift of tounges were the ability to be understood by everyone , no matter what languages they know , there would be no need for the gift of interpretation , and I Corinthians 14 would not have had to have been written . > Perhaps I would believe the `` gifted ones '' more if they were > glorifying God rather than themselves . Then perhaps we'd > witness a real miracle . That 's a pretty harsh assumption to make about a several million Christians world wide . Sure , there are some who want glory for themselves who speak in tounges , just as there are among those who do not have this gift . There were people like this in the Corinthian church also . that does not mean that there is no true gift or that all who speak in tounges do it for their own glory in the sight of men . I would venture to say that a large percentage of those who do speak in tounges do so more often in private prayer than in public .

That 's exactly what the government wants all sheep-minded people to think . Let 's look at the current situation . It allows to almost anybody to eavesdrop almost everybody , unless secure ( and I mean secure ) encryption is used . What will happen when ( `` if '' ? Ha ! optimists ... ) the new proposal gets accepted ? Almost nobody EXCEPT SOME will be able to eavesdrop everybody else , but the ability of these `` some '' to eavesdrop will be guaranteed ! The proposal emphasizes on the former ( `` almost nobody '' ) - which is clearly an improvement - and `` forgets '' to mention the drawbacks of the latter ( `` guaranteed '' ) . Yes , my statement assumes that the next step will be to make the strong crypto unlawful . You think that it will not happen ?

It may be that one day man not only can create life but can also create man . Now , I do n't see this happening in my lifetime , nor do I assert it is probable .

As far as we can tell , man falls into the `` mammal '' catagory . Now , if there were something more to the man ( say , a soul ) , then we have yet to find evidence of such .

Mets ( to the tune of `` Like a Rolling Stone '' ) Once upon a time you played so fine you threw away Dykstra before his prime , did n't you ? People said `` Beware Cone , he 's bound to roam '' But you thought they were just kidding you . You used to laugh about , The Strawberry that was headin ' out . But now you do n't talk so loud , Now you do n't seem so proud , About having to shop Vince Coleman for your next deal ... . Phillies ( to the tune of `` Highway 61 '' ) Well Daulton and Dykstra should have some fun , Just keep them off of Highway 61 !

From : jackw @ boi.hp.com ( jack wood ) Subject : BBB Autoline Arbitration Organization : Hewlett-Packard / Boise , Idaho X-Newsreader : TIN [ version 1.1.4 PL6 ] Keywords : bbb arbitration lemon Lines : 46 My BBB Autoline arbitration experience is over . The outcome was decidedly mixed . I won the battle but lost the war . The arbitrator found that the car was defective , but decided to offer a repurchase well below market value : ( . At the time of the hearing , average retail on my truck in the NADA book was $ 21,025 , but the decision was for $ 17,665 . I wrote a letter to the Council of Better Business Bureaus pointing out the fact that if you have an automobile that does not depreciate rapidly , the manufacturer has no incentive to deal with you . There is no way that the manufacturer can loose because they can turn around and sell the vehicle at a profit if the consumer is awarded a repurchase . The attitude of Chevrolet 's representative at the hearing tends to support this point of view ; he was totally unprepared and did not seem to take the proceeding very seriously . I decided to take the repurchase , even though I am getting totally screwed on the price . I will not have to deal with continuing repairs or selling a lemon myself , and I have no case for a civil suit based on the Idaho lemon law . I am planning to send a letter to my elected representatives telling them how utterly ridiculous the Idaho lemon law is . The law allows for a `` use deduction '' equal to the IRS mileage allowance . As if Chevrolet were buying my gas and paying for my insurance . Summary of the case : In May 1992 I bought a new 3/4 ton HD Chevrolet pickup . Between May 1992 and December 1992 this vehicle required repair after repair . Systems that required attention included the transmission , heater fan , paint , suspension , and motor . The main problem was the five speed manual transmission . They could not install a non-defective transmission in at least four attempts . So , in summary , it is possible to get a repurchase , but you are going to get screwed on the price , unless you paid too much in the first place , or if your car happens to be a model that depreciates rapidly . jackw @ hpdmd48.boi.hp.com

How do I make a screendump or print my application ? The xwd client in the X11 distributions can be used to select a window or the background . It produces an XWD-format file of the image of that window . The file can be post-processed into something useful or printed with the xpr client and your local printing mechanism . You can use this command : csh % sleep 10 ; xwd -root > output.xwd & and then spend 10 seconds or so setting up your screen ; the entire current display will be saved into the file output.xwd . Note that xwd also has an undocumented ( before R5 ) -id flag for specifying the window id on the command-line . [ There are also unofficial patches on export to xwd for specifying the delay and the portion of the screen to capture . ] Two publicly-available programs which allow interactive definition of arbitrary portions of the display and built-in delays are asnap and xgrabsc . There are several versions of xgrabsc ; version 2.2 , available on export [ 8/92 ] is the most recent . xsnap includes some asnap features and supersedes it ; it also renders XPM output [ version unknown ] . It is available on export or avahi.inria.fr ; see xsnap-pl2.tar.Z . A screen-dump and merge/edit program combining features of xwd and xpr is available from vernam.cs.uwm.edu as xdump1.0.tar.Z . Information : soft-eng @ cs.uwm.edu . xprint , by Alberto Accomazzi ( alberto @ cfa.harvard.edu ) is available from cfa0 ( 128.103.40.1 ) in xprint.export-2.1.tar.Z . To post-process the xwd output of some of these tools , you can use xpr , which is part of the X11 distribution . Also on several archives are xwd2ps and XtoPS , which produce Encapsulated PostScript with trimmings suitable for use in presentations ( see export.lcs.mit.edu : contrib/xwd2ps.tar.Z and contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z ) . Also useful is the PBMPLUS package on many archive servers ; and the Xim package contains Level 2 color PostScript output . The XV program can grab a portion of the X display , manipulate it , and save it in one of the available formats . ImageMagick has similar capabilities . Also : Bristol Technology ( info @ bristol.com , 203-438-6969 ) offers Xprinter 2.0 , an Xlib API for PostScript and PCL printers ; a demo is on ftp.uu.net in vendor/Bristol/Xprinter . ColorSoft 9619-459-8500 ) offers OPENprint package includes a screen- capture facility , image-processing , and support for PostScript and non-PostScript printers . Some vendors ' implementations of X ( e.g . DECWindows and OpenWindows ) include session managers or other desktop programs which include `` print portion of screen '' or `` take a snapshot '' options . Some platforms also have tools which can be used to grab the frame-buffer directly ; the Sun systems , for example , have a 'screendump ' program which produces a Sun raster file . Some X terminals have local screen-dump utilities to write PostScript to a local serial printer . Some vendors ' implementations of lpr ( e.g . Sony ) include direct support for printing xwd files , but you 'll typically need some other package to massage the output into a useful format which you can get to the printer . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Subject : 25 ) How do I make a color PostScript screendump of the X display ?

The likeliest program is an incarnation of Jef Poskanzer 's useful++ Portable Bitmap Toolkit , which includes a number of programs for converting among various image formats . It includes support for many types of bitmaps , gray-scale images , and full-color images . PBMPLUS has been updated recently ; the most recent version [ 12/91 ] is on export in contrib/pbmplus10dec91.tar.Z . Another tool is San Diego Supercomputing Center 's IMtools ( 'imconv ' in particular ) , which packages the functionality of PBM into a single binary . It 's available anonymous ftp from sdsc.edu ( 132.249.20.22 ) . Useful for viewing some image-formats is Jim Frost 's xloadimage , a version of which is in the R4 directory contrib/clients/xloadimage ; there are later versions available , including contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z on export . Graeme Gill 's updates to an earlier version of xloadimage are also on export ; see xli.README and xli.tar.Z.uu ; version 1.14 was released 2/93 . xv ( X Image Viewer ) , written by bradley @ cis.upenn.edu ( John Bradley ) , can read and display pictures in Sun Raster , PGM , PBM , PPM , X11 bitmap , TIFF , GIF and JPEG . It can manipulate on the images : adjust , color , intensity , contrast , aspect ratio , crop ) . It can save images in all of the aforementioned formats plus PostScript . It can grab a portion of the X display , manipulate on it , and save it in one of the available formats . The program was updated 5/92 ; see the file contrib/xv-2.21.tar.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu .

The Img Software Set , by Paul Raveling < raveling @ venera.isi.edu > , reads and writes its own image format , displays on an X11 screen , and does some image manipulations . Version 1.3 is available via FTP on expo.lcs.mit.edu as contrib/img_1.3.tar.Z , along with large collection of color images . The Utah RLE Toolkit is a conversion and manipulation package similar to PBMPLUS . Available via FTP as cs.utah.edu : pub/urt-* , weedeater.math.yale.edu : pub/urt-* , and freebie.engin.umich.edu : pub/urt-* . Xim , The X Image Manipulator , by Philip Thompson , does essential interactive displaying , editing , filtering , and converting of images . There is a version in the X11R4 contrib area ; but a more recent version ( using R4 and Motif 1.1 ) is available from gis.mit.edu ( 18.80.1.118 ) . Xim reads/writes gif , xwd , xbm , tiff , rle , xim , ( writes level 2 eps ) and other formats and also has a library and command-line utilities for building your own applications . ImageMagick [ 2.3 ; 2/93 ] by cristy @ dupont.com can be retrieved from export 's contrib area . It is a collection of utilities to transform and display images on any X server . The tool uses the MIFF format ; filters to and from MIFF from other popular formats ( PPM , TIFF , GIF , SUN Raster , etc ) are included . xtiff is a tool for viewing a TIFF file in an X window . It was written to handle as many different kinds of TIFF files as possible while remaining simple , portable and efficient . xtiff illustrates some common problems with building pixmaps and using different visual classes . It is distributed as part of Sam Leffler 's libtiff package and it is also available on export.lcs.mit.edu , uunet.uu.net and comp.sources.x . [ dbs @ decwrl.dec.com,10/90 ] xtiff 2.0 was announced in 4/91 ; it includes Xlib and Xt versions .

The solution involves sending an escape sequence to xterm which will cause it to update the property which the window manager relies upon for the string which appears in the window titlebar . A solution is as easy as typing this in an xterm running a shell : echo `` ESC ] 2 ; TEXT^G '' where ESC is the escape key , TEXT is the string you wish to have displayed , and ^G is a Control-G ( the BEL character ) . Here is a more complicated csh alias which changes the titlebar to the current working directory when you change directories : alias newcd 'cd \ ! * ; echo -n ESC ] 2\ ; $ cwd^G' The digit ' 2 ' in these strings indicates to xterm that it should change only the title of the window ; to change both the title and the name used in the icon , use the digit ' 0 ' instead , and use ' 1 ' to change only the icon name . Note : another way to do this , which prevents an incorrect display of the local directory if a modified ` cd ` is used in a subshell , is to wrap the escape sequences into the PS1 prompt itself . Note : on an IBM RS/6000 is may be necessary to begin the sequence with a ^V . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Subject : 29 ) Where can I find the xterm control sequences ?

You are probably setting the geometry small accidentally . If you give a resource specification like this : xterm*geometry : 80x24 then you are asking for all widgets under xterm to have their geometry set to 80x24 . For the main window , this is OK , as it uses characters for its size . But its popup menus do n't ; they are in pixels and show up small . To set only the terminal widget to have the specified geometry , name it explicitly : xterm*VT100.geometry : 80x24 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Subject : 33 ) How can I print the current selection ? You could paste it into an xterm after executing the lpr command . However , a program by Richard Hesketh ( rlh2 @ ukc.ac.uk ) specifically for manipulating the selection will help ; e.g . % xselection PRIMARY | lpr finds the primary selection and prints it . This command can be placed in a window-manager menu or in shell-scripts . xselection also permits the setting of the selection and other properties . A version is on export .

You can use several environment variables to control how resources are loaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH , XUSERFILESEARCHPATH , and XAPPLRESDIR . These environment variables control where Xt looks for application-defaults files as an application is initializing . Xt loads at most one app-defaults file from the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from the path defined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH . Set XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a way that app-defaults files appear in several different directory hierarchies . Suppose , for example , that you are running Sun 's Open Windows , and you also have some R4 X applications installed in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults . You could set a value like this for XFILESEARCHPATH , and it would cause Xt to look up app-defaults files in both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib ( or wherever your OPENWINHOME is located ) : setenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/ % T/ % N : $ OPENWINHOME/lib/ % T/ % N The value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of pathnames . The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows ( see XtResolvePathname ( ) ) : % N The value of the filename parameter , or the application 's class name . % T The value of the file `` type '' . In this case , the literal string `` app-defaults '' % C customization resource ( R5 only ) % S Suffix . None for app-defaults . % L Language , locale , and codeset ( e.g . `` ja_JP.EUC '' ) % l Language part of % L ( e.g . `` ja '' ) % t The territory part of the display 's language string % c The codeset part of the display 's language string Let 's take apart the example . Suppose the application 's class name is '' Myterm '' . Also , suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin . ( Notice the example omits locale-specific lookup . ) /usr/lib/X11/ % T/ % N means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm $ OPENWINHOME/lib/ % T/ % N means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/Myterm As the application initializes , Xt tries to open both of the above app-defaults files , in the order shown . As soon as it finds one , it reads it and uses it , and stops looking for others . The effect of this path is to search first in /usr/lib/X11 , then in /usr/openwin . Let 's consider another example . This time , let 's set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the current working directory , then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults . setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./ % N.ad : $ HOME/app-defaults/ % N The first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad . The second expands to $ HOME/app-defaults/Myterm . This is a convenient setting for debugging because it follows the Imake convention of naming the app-defaults file Myterm.ad in the application 's source directory , so you can run the application from the directory in which you are working and still have the resources loaded properly . NOTE : when looking for app-default files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH , for some bizarre reason , neither the type nor file suffix is defined so % T and % S are useless . With R5 , there 's another twist . You may specify a customization resource value . For example , you might run the `` myterm '' application like this : myterm -xrm `` *customization : -color '' If one of your pathname specifications had the value '' /usr/lib/X11/ % T/ % N % C '' then the expanded pathname would be '' /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color '' because the % C substitution character takes on the value of the customization resource . The default XFILESEARCHPATH , compiled into Xt , is : /usr/lib/X11/ % L/ % T/ % N % C : \ ( R5 ) /usr/lib/X11/ % l/ % T/ % N % C : \ ( R5 ) /usr/lib/X11/ % T/ % N % C : \ ( R5 ) /usr/lib/X11/ % L/ % T/ % N : \ /usr/lib/X11/ % l/ % T/ % N : \ /usr/lib/X11/ % T/ % N ( Note : some sites replace /usr/lib/X11 with a ProjectRoot in this batch of default settings . ) The default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH , also compiled into Xt , is < root > / % L/ % N % C : \ ( R5 ) < root > / % l/ % N % C : \ ( R5 ) < root > / % N % C : \ ( R5 ) < root > / % L/ % N : \ < root > / % l/ % N : \ < root > / % N : < root > is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user 's home directory if XAPPLRESDIR is not set . If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some value other than the default , Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether . Notice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find your app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set XAPPLRESDIR to `` . `` , a single dot . In R3 , all this machinery worked differently ; for R3 compatibilty , many people set their XAPPLRESDIR value to `` ./ '' , a dot followed by a slash .

The answer lies in changing xdm 's xrdb resource in the xdm-config file to run a program to change the background before loading the resources ; for example , your /usr/lib/X11/xdm/xdm-config file may add the line DisplayManager.0.authorize : false to permit unrestricted access to the display before log-in ( beware ! ) and also DisplayManager*xrdb : /usr/lib/X11/xdm/new.xrdb where that file does something ( for all connections ) along the lines of : # ! /bin/sh # comes in with arguments : -display :0 -load /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xresources /usr/bin/X11/xsetroot -display $ 2 -bitmap /usr/lib/X11/xdm/new.bitmap /usr/bin/X11/xrdb $ * Substitute xloadimage or xv for xsetroot , to taste .

It includes xrsh , a script to start an X application on remote machine , and xrlogin , a script to start a local xterm running rlogin to a remote machine . A more recent version is on export in xrsh-5.4.shar . One solution is to use the xrlogin program from der Mouse ( mouse @ larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu ) . You can ftp caveat-emptor versions from 132.206.1.1 , in X/xrlogin.c and X/xrlogind.c . The program packages up $ TERM and $ DISPLAY into a single string , which is stuffed into $ TERM . rlogin then propagates $ TERM normally ; your .cshrc on the remote machine should contain eval ` xrlogind ` where xrlogind is a program that checks $ TERM and if it is of the special format it recognizes , unpacks it and spits out setenv and unsetenv commands to recreate the environment variables . [ 11/90 ] In addition , if all you need to do is start a remote X process on another host , and you find rsh < HOST > -n /usr/bin/X11/xterm -display $ DISPLAY too simple ( DISPLAY must have your real hostname ) , then this version of xrsh can be used to start up remote X processes . The equivalent usage would be xrsh < HOST > xterm # ! /bin/sh # start an X11 process on another host # Date : 8 Dec 88 06:29:34 GMT # From : Chris Torek < chris @ mimsy.umd.edu > # rsh $ host -n `` setenv DISPLAY $ DISPLAY ; exec $ @ < /dev/null > & /dev/null '' # # An improved version : # rXcmd ( suggested by John Robinson , jr @ bbn.com ) # ( generalized for sh , ksh by Keith Boyer , keith @ cis.ohio-state.edu ) # # but they put the rcmd in ( ) 's which left zombies again .

One way is to use the `` bitmap '' client or some other bitmap-editor ( e.g . Sun 's icon-editor tool , post-processed with pbmplus ) to design the individual characters and then to do some large amount of post-processing to concatenate them into the BDF format . See Ollie Jones 's article in the November 91 X Journal for more information . The R3 contrib/ area ( in fonts/utils/ and in clients/xtroff ) contained a number of useful utilities , including some to convert between BDF font format and a simple character format which can be edited with any text editor . An easier way is to use the `` xfed '' client to modify an existing font ; a version is on the R4 or R5 X11R5 contrib tape in contrib/clients/xfed . Xfed is available for anonymous ftp on ftp.Informatik.Uni-Dortmund.DE [ 129.217.64.63 ] , possibly as file /pub/windows/X/Diverse-X11-Sourcen/xfed.tar.Z . It can produce BDF-format fonts which can be compiled for a variety of X servers . The xfedor client from Group Bull permits creation of bitmaps , cursors , XPM1 pixmaps , and fonts . Binaries for common machines are on avahi.inria.fr in /pub ; in addition , the sources ( an old Xlib implementation ) have been placed [ 5/91 ] in export : /contrib . If you are a MetaFont user you can use `` mftobdf '' from the SeeTeX distribution to convert PK , GF , and PXL fonts to BDF format ; the distribution is on ftp.cs.colorado.edu and on export.lcs.mit.edu . The GNU package fontutils-0.4.tar.Z on prep.ai.mit.edu includes xbfe , a font editor , and a number of utilities for massaging font formats . The O'Reilly X Resource issue # 2 contains an article on using these tools to modify a font . Fonts can be resized with Hiroto Kagotani 's bdfresize ; a new version is in ftp.cs.titech.ac.jp : /X11/contrib . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Subject : 39 ) Why does adding a font to the server not work ( sic ) ? After you have built the font using your system 's font-compiler , installed it in some directory , and run ` mkfontdir ` or your system 's equivalent ( e.g . bldfamily for OpenWindows ) in that directory , be sure to use ` xset +fp $ dir ` to add that full path-name to the server 's font-path , *or* if the directory is already in the path , use ` xset fp rehash ` so that the new fonts in that directory are actually found ; it is this last step that you 're probably leaving out . ( You can also use ` xset q ` to make sure that that directory is in the path . ) Sometimes your `` xset +fp $ dir '' command fails with a BadValue error : X Error of failed request : BadValue ( integer parameter out of range for operation ) Major opcode of failed request : 51 ( X_SetFontPath ) This means the X server can not find or read your font directory , or that your directory does not look like a font directory to the server . ( The mention of an `` integer parameter '' in the message is spurious . ) -- Is the font directory you 're specifying readable from the SERVER 's file system ? Remember , it 's the server , not the client , which interprets your font directory . Trouble in this area is especially likely when you issue an xset command with shell metacharacters in it ( e.g . `` xset +fp ~/myfonts '' ) and the server is an X terminal or managed by xdm . -- Is the directory really a font directory ? If you 're running an MIT server ( or most varieties of vendor servers ) look in the directory for the file `` fonts.dir '' . If you ca n't find that file , run mkfontdir ( 1 ) . ( If you're running OpenWindows , look for the file `` Families.list '' . If you ca n't find it , run bldfamily ( 1 ) . ) -- If you 're in a site where some people run X11Rn servers and others run a proprietary server with nonstandard font formats ( OpenWindows , for example ) , make sure the font directory is right for the server you 're using . Hint : if the directory contains .pcf and/or .snf files , it wo n't work for Open Windows . If the directory contains .ff and/or .fb files , it wo n't work for X11Rn .

The DECwindows fonts typically do n't exist on a non-DEC installation , but rewrite rules can be used to alias fonts used by DECwindows applications to standard MIT fonts of similar characteristics and size . Pick up the file contrib/DECwindows_on_X11R4_font.aliases from export.lcs.mit.edu ; this file is for a standard MIT R4 server .

How can I set backgroundPixmap in a defaults file ? ( What is XPM ? ) I want to be able to do something like this : xclock*backgroundPixmap : /usr/include/X11/bitmaps/rootweave You ca n't do this . The backgroundPixmap resource is a pixmap of the same depth as the screen , not a bitmap ( which is a pixmap of depth 1 ) . Because of this , writing a generic String to Pixmap converter is impossible , since there is no accepted convention for a file format for pixmaps . Therefore , neither the X Toolkit or the Athena widget set define a String to Pixmap converter , because there is no converter you can not specify this value as a resource . The Athena widget set does define a String to Bitmap converter for use in many of its widgets , however . [ courtesy Chris D. Peterson ( now kit @ ics.com ) , 4/90 ] However : A specific converter which encapsulates much of the functionality of the xloadimage package by Jim Frost was posted 12/90 by Sebastian Wangnick ( basti @ unido.informatik.uni-dortmund.de ) ; it permits loading of a number of image formats as a pixmap . The leading general-purpose format for pixmaps is the XPM format used by Groupe Bull in several of its programs , including the GWM window manager , by AT & T in its olpixmap editor , and by ICS in its interface builder . XPM distribution , available on export as contrib/xpm.tar.Z , includes read/write routines which can easily be adapted to converters by new widgets which want to allow specification of pixmap resources in the above manner . See information on the xpm-talk mailing list above . XPM 3.0f was announced in 3/93 and is available from export.lcs.mit.edu and avahi.inria.fr ; an older version is on the R5 contrib tape .

As for how foods taste : If I 'm not allergic to MSG and I like the taste of it , why should n't I use it ?

Why do we bother with them ? How should food be tasted ? Is n't it better left to the diner ? Julie DISCLAIMER : All opinions here belong to my cat and no one else

If this is true , how can > this possibly be fair to the infants ? What do you mean fair ? God is just , giving to everyone what they deserve . As all infants are in sin from the time of conception ( cf Romans 5.12 , Psalm 1.7 ) , they can not possibly merit heaven , and as purgatory is for the purging of temporal punishment and venial sins , it is impossible that origianl sin can be forgiven . Hence , the unbaptized infants are cut off from the God against whom they , with the whole of the human race except Mary , have sinned . Which is why Jesus said , '' Truly , truly I say to you , no one can enter the Kingdom of God unless he is born of water and Spirit '' which is the true meaning of born again ( John 3.5 ) . Thus , as infants are in sin , it is very fair for them to be cut off from God and exlcuded from heaven .

From : mcelwre @ cnsvax.uwec.edu Subject : THE DIVINE MASTERS Organization : University of Wisconsin Eau Claire Lines : 208 THE DIVINE MASTERS Most Christians would agree , and correctly so , that Jesus Christ was a Divine Master , and a projection of God into the physical world , God Incarnate . But there are some very important related facts that Christians are COMPLETELY IGNORANT of , as are followers of most other world religions . First , Jesus Christ was NOT unique , John 3:16 NOTWITH- STANDING . There is ALWAYS at least one such Divine Master ( God Incarnate ) PHYSICALLY ALIVE in this world AT ALL TIMES , a continuous succession THROUGHOUT HISTORY , both before and after the life of Jesus . The followers of some of these Masters founded the world 's major religions , usually PERVERTING the teachings of their Master in the process . Christians , for example , added THREATS of `` ETERNAL DAMNATION '' in Hell , and DELETED the teaching of REincarnation . Secondly , and more importantly , after a particular Master physically dies and leaves this world , there is NOTHING that He can do for ANYbody except for the relatively few people that He INITIATED while He was still PHYSICALLY alive . ( THAT IS SIMPLY THE WAY GOD SET THINGS UP IN THE UNIVERSES . ) Therefore , all those Christians who worship Jesus , and pray to Jesus , and expect Jesus to return and save them from their sins , are only KIDDING THEMSELVES , and have allowed themselves to be DUPED by a religion that was mostly MANUFACTURED by the Romans . And emotional `` feelings '' are a TOTALLY DECEIVING indicator for religious validity . These things are similarly true for followers of most other major world religions , including Islam . Thirdly , the primary function of each Master is to tune His Initiates into the `` AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM '' or `` SOUND CURRENT '' , ( referred to as `` THE WORD '' in John 1:1-5 , and as `` The River of Life '' in Revelation 22:1 ) , and to personally guide each of them thru the upper levels of Heaven while they are still connected to their living physical bodies by a `` silver cord '' . True Salvation , which completes a Soul 's cycles of REincarnation in the physical and psychic planes , is achieved only by reaching at least the `` SOUL PLANE '' , which is five levels or universes above the physical universe , and this can NOT be done without the help of a PHYSICALLY-Living Divine Master . One such Divine Master alive today is an American , Sri Harold Klemp , the Living `` Eck '' Master or `` Mahanta '' for the `` Eckankar '' organization , now headquartered in Minneapolis , ( P.O . Box 27300 ; zip 55427 ) . Another Divine Master is Maharaj Gurinder Singh Ji , now living in Punjab , India , and is associated with the `` Sant Mat '' organization . One of the classic books on this subject is `` THE PATH OF THE MASTERS '' ( Radha Soami Books , P.O . Box 242 , Gardena , CA 90247 ) , written in 1939 by Dr. Julian Johnson , a theologian and surgeon who spent the last years of his life in India studying under and closely observing the Sant Mat Master of that time , Maharaj Sawan Singh Ji . Several of the Eckankar books , including some authored by Sri Paul Twitchell or Sri Harold Klemp , can be found in most public and university libraries and some book stores , or obtained thru inter-library loan . The book `` ECKANKAR -- THE KEY TO SECRET WORLDS '' , by Sri Paul Twitchell , is ANOTHER classic . Many Christians are likely to confuse the Masters with the `` Anti-Christ '' , which is or was to be a temporary world dictator during the so-called `` last days '' . But the Masters do n't ever rule , even when asked or expected to do so as Jesus was . People who continue following Christianity , Islam , or other orthodox religions with a physically-DEAD Master , will CONTINUE on their cycles of REincarnation , between the Psychic Planes and this MISERABLE physical world , until they finally accept Initiation from a PHYSICALLY-LIVING Divine Master . RE-INCARNATION The book `` HERE AND HEREAFTER '' , by Ruth Montgomery , describes several kinds of evidence supporting REincarnation as a FACT OF LIFE , including HYPNOTIC REGRESSIONS to past lives [ about 50 % accurate ; the subconscious mind sometimes makes things up , especially with a bad hypnotist ] , SPONTANEOUS RECALL ( especially by young children , some of whom can identify their most recent previous relatives , homes , possessions , etc . ) , DREAM RECALL of past life experi- ences , DEJA VU ( familiarity with a far off land while travel- ing there for the first time on vacation ) , the psychic read- ings of the late EDGAR CAYCE , and EVEN SUPPORTING STATEMENTS FROM THE CHRISTIAN BIBLE including Matthew 17:11-13 ( John the Baptist was the REINCARNATION of Elias . ) and John 9:1-2 ( How can a person POSSIBLY sin before he is born , unless he LIVED BEFORE ? ! ) . [ ALWAYS use the `` KING JAMES VERSION '' . Later versions are PER-VERSIONS ! ] Strong INTERESTS , innate TALENTS , strong PHOBIAS , etc. , typically originate from a person 's PAST LIVES . For example , a strong fear of swimming in or traveling over water usually results from having DROWNED at the end of a PREVIOUS LIFE . And sometimes a person will take AN IMMEDIATE DISLIKE to another person being met for the first time in THIS life , because of a bad encounter with him during a PREVIOUS INCARNATION . The teaching of REincarnation also includes the LAW OF KARMA ( Galatians 6:7 , Revelation 13:10 , etc. ) . People would behave much better toward each other if they knew that their actions in the present will surely be reaped by them in the future , or in a FUTURE INCARNATION ! `` 2nd COMINGS '' If a Divine Master physically dies ( `` translates '' ) before a particular Initiate of His does , then when that Initiate physically dies ( `` translates '' ) , the Master will meet him on the Astral level and take him directly to the Soul Plane . This is the ONE AND ONLY correct meaning of a 2nd Coming . It is an INDIVIDUAL experience , NOT something that happens for everyone all at once . People who are still waiting for Jesus ' `` 2nd Coming '' are WAITING IN VAIN . PLANES OF EXISTENCE The physical universe is the LOWEST of at least a DOZEN major levels of existence . Above the Physical Plane is the Astral Plane , the Causal Plane , the Mental Plane , the Etheric Plane ( often counted as the upper part of the Mental Plane ) , the Soul Plane , and several higher Spiritual Planes . The Soul Plane is the FIRST TRUE HEAVEN , ( counting upward from the Physical ) . The planes between ( but NOT including ) the Physical and Soul Planes are called the Psychic Planes . It is likely that ESP , telepathy , astrological influences , radionic effects , biological transmutations [ See the 1972 book with that title . ] , and other phenomena without an apparent physical origin , result from INTERACTIONS between the Psychic Planes and the Physical Plane . The major planes are also SUB-DIVIDED . For example , a sub-plane of the Astral Plane is called `` Hades '' , and the Christian Hell occupies a SMALL part of it , created there LESS THAN 2000 YEARS AGO by the EARLY CATHOLIC CHURCH by some kind of black magic or by simply teaching its existence in a THREATENING manner . The Christian `` Heaven '' is located elsewhere on the Astral Plane . Good Christians will go there for a short while and then REincarnate back to Earth . SOUND CURRENT vs . BLIND FAITH The Christian religion demands of its followers an extraordinary amount of BLIND FAITH backed up by little more than GOOD FEELING ( which is TOTALLY DECEIVING ) . If a person is not HEARING some form of the `` SOUND CURRENT '' ( `` THE WORD '' , `` THE BANI '' , `` THE AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM '' ) , then his cycles of REINCARNATION in this MISERABLE world WILL CONTINUE . The `` SOUND CURRENT '' manifests differently for different Initiates , and can sound like a rushing wind , ocean waves on the sea shore , buzzing bees , higher-pitched buzzing sound , a flute , various heavenly music , or other sounds . In Eckankar , Members start hearing it near the end of their first year as a Member . This and other experiences ( such as `` SOUL TRAVEL '' ) REPLACE blind faith . For more information , answers to your questions , etc. , please consult my CITED SOURCES ( 3 books , 2 addresses ) .

Seems to me you should be able to throw a dehydrator together > for just a few bucks . Heck , the technology is only what ? 1,000 years old ? You can learn how to build a deyhdrator very easily from the book , `` The Hungry Hiker 's Guide to Good Food , '' by Gretchen McHugh . The heat source is a 100 watt light bulb . Basically , it 's a vertical wooden box with ventilation holes in the top and bottom ( lots of them , you want the air to flow ) . The light bulb goes in the bottom , and wire cake racks are spaced every 6 '' starting about 10 '' above the bulb . Or , at a slightly higher cost in electricity , you can do what I do : Use your oven . ( NOTE - I do this in an electric oven ; some gas ovens may not have a low enough setting ) . Put food to be dried on cookie tins or racks in the oven . Set oven to 140 degrees ( the lowest setting on my oven - if yours goes down to 120 that 's probably even better . ) Stick a wooden spoon or something across the front corner of the oven and close the door on the spoon so that it stays open about an inch - this allows for airflow . Leave the stuff in the oven for 6 to 8 hours ; check it often , since this dries it much faster than the dehydrator . If you are using cookie sheets instead of racks , turn the stuff over halfway through .

And I still disagree with your contention that nobody who does n't use methods deemed `` scientific '' can possibly know what 's true and what 's not . > [ Deleted material which I agree with . ] > > Back to Lee Lady : > > > These are not the rules according to many who post to sci.med and > > sci.psychology .

( To > reuse the previous example , we know that conclusions from > uncontrolled observations of the treatment of chronic medical > problems are notoriously problematic . ) Okay , so let 's see if we agree on this : FIRST of all , there are degrees of certainty . It might be appropriate , for instance , to demand carefully controlled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth ( to the extent that there is any such thing ) the effectiveness of a certain treatment . On the other hand , highly favorable clinical experience , even if uncontrolled , can be adequate to justify a *preliminary* judgement that a treatment is useful . This is often the best evidence we can hope for from investigators who do not have institutional or corporate support . In this case , it makes sense to tentatively treat claims as credible but to reserve final judgement until establishment scientists who are qualified and have the necessary resources can do more careful testing . SECONDLY , it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of evidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal . I come to this dispute about what science is not only as a mathematician but as a veteran of many arguments in sci.psychology ( and occasionally in sci.med ) about NLP ( Neurolinguistic Programming ) . Much of the work done to date by NLPers can be better categorized as informal exploration than as careful scientific research . For years now I have been trying to get scientific and clinical psychologists to just take a look at it , to read a few of the books and watch some of the videotapes ( courtesy of your local university library ) . Not for the purpose of making a definitive judgement , but simply to look at the NLP methodology ( especially the approach to eliciting information from subjects ) and look for ideas and hypotheses which might be of scientific interest . And most especially to be aware of the *questions* NLP suggests which might be worthy of scientific investigation . Over and over again the response I get in sci.pychology is `` If this has n't been thoroughly validated by the accepted form of empirical research then it ca n't be of any interest to us . '' To me , the ultimate reducio ad absurdum of the extreme `` There 've got to be controlled studies '' position is an NLP technique called the Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure . Simple phobias ( as opposed to agoraphobia ) may not be the world 's most important psychological disorder , but the nice thing about them is that it does n't take a sophisticated instrument to diagnose them or tell when someone is cured of one . The NLP phobia cure is a simple visualization which requires less than 15 minutes . ( NLPers claim that it can also be used to neutralize a traumatic memory , and hence is useful in treating Post-traumatic Stress Syndrome . ) It is essentially a variation on the classic desensitization process used by behavioral therapists . A subject only needs to be taken through the technique once ( or , in the case of PTSD , once for each traumatic incident ) . The process does n't need to be repeated and the subject does n't need to practice it over again at home . Now to me , it seems pretty easy to test the effectiveness of this cure . ( Especially if , as NLPers claim , the success rate is extremely high . ) Take someone with a fear of heights ( as I used to have ) . Take them up to a balcony on the 20th floor and observe their response . Spend 15 minutes to have them do the simple visualization . Send them back up to the balcony and see if things have changed . Check back with them in a few weeks to see if the cure seems to be lasting . ( More long term follow-up is certainly desirable , but from a scientific point of view even a cure that lasts several weeks has significance . In any case , there are many known cases where the cure has lasted years . To the best of my knowledge , there is no known case where the cure has been reversed after holding for a few weeks . ) ( My own cure , incidentally , was done with a slightly different NLP technique , before I learned of the Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure . Ten years later now , I enjoy living on the 17th floor of my building and having a large balcony . ) The folks over in sci.psychology have a hundred and one excuses not to make this simple test . They claim that only an elaborate outcome study will be satisfactory -- - a study of the sort that NLP practitioners , many of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice , can ill afford to do . ( Most of them are also just plain not interested , because the whole idea seems frivolous . And since they 're not part of the scientific establishment , they have no tangible rewards to gain from scientific acceptance . ) The Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure is over ten years old now and the clinical psychology establishment is still saying `` We do n't have any way of knowing that it 's effective . '' These academics themselves have the resources to do a study as elaborate as anyone could want , of course , but they say `` Why should I prove your theory ? '' and `` The burden of proof is on the one making the claim . '' One academic in sci.psychology said that it would be completely unscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it has n't been described in a scientific journal . ( It 's described in a number of books and I 've posted articles in sci.psychology describing it in as much detail as I 'm capable of . ) Actually , at least one fairly careful academic study has been done ( with favorable results ) , but it 's apparently not acceptable because it 's a doctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal . To me , this sort of attitude does not advance science but hinders it . This is the kind of thing I have in mind when I talk about `` doctrinnaire '' attitudes about science . Now maybe I have been unfair in imputing such attitudes to you , Russell . If so , I apologize . -- In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists , psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects . lady @ uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu lady @ uhunix.bitnet

I attribute my success to several factors : Very low fat . Except when someone else has cooked a meal for me , I only eat fruit , vegetables , and whole grain or bran cereals . I estimate I only get about 5 to 10 percent of my calories from fat . Very little sugar or salt . Very high fiber . Most Americans get about 10 grams . 25 to 35 are recommended . I get between 50 and 150 . Sometimes 200 . ( I 've heard of people taking fiber pills . It seems unlikely that pills can contain enough fiber to make a difference . It would be about as likely as someone getting fat by popping fat pills . Tablets are just too small , unless you snarf down hundreds of them daily . ) My `` clean your plate '' conditioning works *for* me . Eating the last 10 % takes half my eating time , and gives satiety a chance to catch up , so I do n't still feel hungry and go start eating something else . I do n't eat when I 'm not hungry ( unless I 'm sure I 'll get hungry shortly , and eating wo n't be practical then ) . I bike to work , 22 miles a day , year round . Fast . I also bike to stores , movies , and everywhere else , as I 've never owned a car . I estimate this burns about 1000 calories a day . It also helps build and maintain muscle mass , prevent insulin resistance ( diabetes runs in my family ) , and increase my metabolism . ( Even so , my metabolism is so low that when I 'm at rest I 'm most comfortable with a temperature in the 90s ( F ) , and usually wear a sweater if it drops to 80 . ) Cycling also motivates me to avoid every excess ounce . ( Cyclists routinely pay a premium for cycling products that weigh slightly less than others . But it 's easier and cheaper to trim weight from the rider than from the vehicle . ) There 's no question in my mind that my metabolism is radically different from that of most people who have never been fat . Fortunately , it is n't different in a way that precludes excellent health . Obviously , I ca n't swear that every obese person who does what I've done will have the success I did . But I 've never yet heard of one who did try it and did n't succeed . > I think all of us cycle . One 's success depends on how large the > fluctuations in the cycle are .

It was created to meet to the daily research needs of scientists conducting climate investigations using satellite data and remote sensing techniques . Intuitive Graphic Interface Sphinx features an interactive interface with pop-up menus and point-and-click dialog boxes which makes image processing and analysis simple and fast . This accessible menuing enables you to build attractive image layouts quickly while also providing you the flexibility of returning to the main menu to conduct other image analysis and processing operations . Image Format Compatibility Using smart read/write functions , Sphinx allows you to easily open and save image files in a variety of formats using bit , integer or real data values . Sphinx also reads and writes the common TIFF and GIF formats as well as compresses and decompresses image formats to save disk space . Image Analysis & Processing For image and pixel analysis , the Sphinx package includes an assortment of processing tools that perform useful statistical and mathematical filtering operations , such as Fourier transforms , convolution product or principal component analyses . An interactive interpreter for both algebraic equations and images allows the user to manipulate and combine individual data channels interactively . Standard FORTRAN notation is used for formula entry and for trig onometric and transcendental functions . Satellite Spectra & Orbit Analysis Sphinx possesses functions to simulate satellite signal sensitivity for various meteorological satellites ( e.g. , GOES , METEOSAT , NOAA , Spot etc. ) . The simulations are conducted for a selection of standard atmospheric and surface conditions and instrument spectral bands . A geometry model computes the solar zenith angles , warping , orbit simulation , and 3-D image projection . Easy External Program Interfacing Sphinx allows users the flexibility to integrate externally developed software algorithms for processing and converting satellite observations . Sphinx exports and imports image files and image parameters to external programs using special interface functions . Quick Quality Presentation Sphinx rapidly displays , manipulates , and enhances high-resolution multispectral images and color tables . Using six 8-bit 1024x1024 image planes and one graphics plane , the package conveniently combines color images , graphics and text to generate sharp digital images for articles and reports . Sphinx 's 2-D and 3-D graphics editor provides complete flexibility for modifying and integrating vector graphics and analysis plots with images , such as histograms and radial graphs . The package supplies color and gray scale output for standard inkjet and laser printers . Other Capabilities Sphinx also performs image animation , external graphics importing , mosaic fitting ... what else ? Software Support & Development Sphinx was developed at the Laboratoire d'Optique Atmospherique ( LOA ) of the Universite de Lille , France . The package has received critical feedback and support from scientists at the French national laboratory , Centre National de Recherche Scientifique ( CNRS ) , and the French space agency , Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales ( CNES ) . At LOA , Sphinx undergoes continued refinement and development to meet changing research needs and advances in computer technology . The package , which features on-line help , is supported by an Internet address sphinx @ loasil.citilille.fr through which questions can be answered and version updates provided without delay .

Well , the fact of the matter is that poverty is imperfectly related to social and political instability , while economic inequality is much more strongly related . In virtually all major revolutions including England ( the Puritan revolution ) , France , Russia and China , the revolutions occurred as economies were undergoing substantial long term growth and poverty was declining . What sets off revolutions is massive inequality coupled with a perception on the part of those at the bottom that social change is possible . If `` poverty ( were ) the main engine of social instability , '' this typical historical pattern would not hold . In fact , revolutions would have been far more typical before the nineteenth century than since that time .

I was going to just put the NEC on the box but then I got to thinking - the monitor has a small tilt/swivel base so maybe the weight would be more concentrated than with Apple 's ( I do n't know the area of the base of their tilt/swivel ) . Additionally , the CDROM drive is in the middle . So I cut a piece of 3/8 '' thick wood to about 16.25 '' x 12 '' , covered it in a cream covered cloth , and used it as a buffer layer between the Centris 's top and the monitor ! !

From : lochem @ fys.ruu.nl ( Gert-Jan van Lochem ) Subject : Dutch : symposium compacte objecten Summary : U wordt uitgenodigd voor het symposium compacte objecten 26-4-93 Keywords : compacte objecten , symposium Organization : Physics Department , University of Utrecht , The Netherlands Lines : 122 Sterrenkundig symposium 'Compacte Objecten' op 26 april 1993 In het jaar 1643 , zeven jaar na de oprichting van de Universiteit van Utrecht , benoemde de universiteit haar eerste sterrenkundige waarnemer . Hiermee ontstond de tweede universiteitssterrenwacht ter wereld . Aert Jansz , de eerste waarnemer , en zijn opvolgers voerden de Utrechtse sterrenkunde in de daaropvolgende jaren , decennia en eeuwen naar de voorhoede van het astronomisch onderzoek . Dit jaar is het 350 jaar geleden dat deze historische benoeming plaatsvond . De huidige generatie Utrechtse sterrenkundigen en studenten sterrenkunde , verenigd in het Sterrekundig Instituut Utrecht , vieren de benoeming van hun 'oervader ' middels een breed scala aan feestelijke activiteiten . Zo is er voor scholieren een planetenproject , programmeert de Studium Generale een aantal voordrachten met een sterrenkundig thema en wordt op de Dies Natalis aan een astronoom een eredoctoraat uitgereikt . Er staat echter meer op stapel . Studenten natuur- en sterrenkunde kunnen op 26 april aan een sterrenkundesymposium deelnemen . De onderwerpen van het symposium zijn opgebouwd rond een van de zwaartepunten van het huidige Utrechtse onderzoek : het onderzoek aan de zogeheten 'compacte objecten ' , de eindstadia in de evolutie van sterren . Bij de samenstelling van het programma is getracht de deelnemer een zo aktueel en breed mogelijk beeld te geven van de stand van zaken in het onderzoek aan deze eindstadia . In de eerste , inleidende lezing zal dagvoorzitter prof. Lamers een beknopt overzicht geven van de evolutie van zware sterren , waarna de zeven overige sprekers in lezingen van telkens een half uur nader op de specifieke evolutionaire eindprodukten zullen ingaan . Na afloop van elke lezing is er gelegenheid tot het stellen van vragen . Het dagprogramma staat afgedrukt op een apart vel . Het niveau van de lezingen is afgestemd op tweedejaars studenten natuur- en sterrenkunde . OOK ANDERE BELANGSTELLENDEN ZIJN VAN HARTE WELKOM ! Tijdens de lezing van prof. Kuijpers zullen , als alles goed gaat , de veertien radioteleskopen van de Radiosterrenwacht Westerbork worden ingezet om via een directe verbinding tussen het heelal , Westerbork en Utrecht het zwakke radiosignaal van een snel roterende kosmische vuurtoren , een zogeheten pulsar , in de symposiumzaal door te geven en te audiovisualiseren . Prof. Kuijpers zal de binnenkomende signalen ( elkaar snel opvolgende scherp gepiekte pulsen radiostraling ) bespreken en trachten te verklaren . Het slagen van dit unieke experiment staat en valt met de technische haalbaarheid ervan . De op te vangen signalen zijn namelijk zo zwak , dat pas na een waarnemingsperiode van 10 miljoen jaar genoeg energie is opgevangen om een lamp van 30 Watt een seconde te laten branden ! Tijdens het symposium zal er niet zo lang gewacht hoeven te worden : de hedendaagse technologie stelt ons in staat live het heelal te beluisteren . Deelname aan het symposium kost f 4 , - ( exclusief lunch ) en f 16 , - ( inclusief lunch ) . Inschrijving geschiedt door het verschuldigde bedrag over te maken op ABN-AMRO rekening 44.46.97.713 t.n.v . stichting 350 JUS . Het gironummer van de ABN-AMRO bank Utrecht is 2900 . Bij de inschrijving dient te worden aangegeven of men lid is van de NNV . Na inschrijving wordt de symposiummap toegestuurd . Bij inschrijving na 31 maart vervalt de mogelijkheid een lunch te reserveren . Het symposium vindt plaats in Transitorium I , Universiteit Utrecht .

When I originally purchased it , I experienced the failure to boot problem . This was fixed soon after by a ROM upgrade on the hard drive . Lately a similar problem has been occuring . When the computer is powered on the HD light flashes a few times and then I am given the `` no disk to boot from '' icon . However , upon turing the computer off and on again the drive ALWAYS boots up just fine . Furthermore , if instead of turning the power on and off I press the reboot button the same problem occurs . But , as I said , turning the power off and on always works . This problem is different from the 1989 boot problem in that before it often required several power off and ons to get it to boot . Does anybody have any suggestions as to what the problem is or how it can be fixed ? I 'm wondering if it 's getting old and requires more time to '' come up to speed '' now . Is there a PRAM or SCSI setting that allows me to tell the computer to wait a little longer before trying to access the HD ? Thanks ! Altan J.

From a pragmatic standpoint , there certainly is some justification if it is a vice people will commit anyway . Shall we criminalize alcohol again ?

Just in case you have n't made the connection ( which I expect you have n't ) the connecting theme in this thread is a persons autonomy over their life and body . Vice statutes serve only to make it more expensive for the rich and more dangerous for the poor , as Tim so eloquently put it .

A : Typically , you will see something like 195/60HR14 . the 195 is the overall width of the tire in millimeters , the tread is usually narrower . The 60 is the ` aspect ratio ' ; it indicates the height of the sidewall of the tire relative to the overall width . Our example tire has a sidewall height of 0.60 * 195 ~= 117 mm . The 14 is the wheel diameter in inches ; there are also some special tires called ` TRX' tires which have three digit metric wheel diameter designations , like 390 , which is in millimeters . The R means Radial , and the H is a speed rating indicating the highest speed at which the tire , when properly inflated and carrying an appropriate load , may safely operate . Common speed ratings are S ( 112MPH ) , T ( 118MPH ) , H ( 130MPH ) , and V ( up to 150MPH . ) Recent changes to the method for specifying tire sizes move the speed rating to a different part of the designation ; you may therefore find designations like 195/60R14 85H ; the 85 indicates the per-tire load associated with the speed rating -- exceeding this load in continuous operation at the rated speed is dangerous practice . What follows is a table showing a number of ` load indices ' and corresponding maximum per-tire loads : Load Index 50 51 88 89 112 113 145 149 157 Max Load ( Kg ) 190 195 560 580 1120 1150 2900 3250 4125 Note that the usual mass vs. weight confusion occurs in this table . In some cases , the letters P or LT may be found in front of a tire size ; the LT designation indicates Light Truck , and the P designation indicates Passenger car . If no letter is given , then the application of the tire is Passenger car usage . As far as I know , these letters only appear in the US market . The LT designation is prinicipally of interest to owners of light trucks and other utility vehicles . For the owner of a passenger vehicle , there is no meaningful difference between a tire with a P designation and one with no designation at all . If the aspect ratio is omitted , it is probably 80 , but may be 78 . Tires with an MS ( mud/snow ) designation may have their speed rating reduced by 20 km/h ( about 12mph . ) There is an additional set of ratings on tires for temperature , traction , and treadwear . Temperature and Traction are graded A , B , and C ( with A the best and C the worst ) ; treadwear is a numeric rating . These values are of limited value , as they are assigned somewhat arbitrarily by tire manufacturers and are thus not useful in comparing different brands of tires . Q : My car has tires with a funny size designation : 185/65HR390 ; can i put normal tires on the car ? A : Your tires are called TRX tires ; they were devised by Michelin . Because of a somewhat different bead design , they are incompatible with normal tires ; Michelin used a different diameter wheel for them so that they could not be mounted on the wrong type wheel ( and so that more conventional tires could not be mounted on TRX type wheels . ) You will need to aquire different wheels to put a normal tire on your car ; it is barely possible to fit normal tires on TRX wheels , and horribly dangerous to do so ( the tires may simply peel off the rims in a corner , or possibly blow out at high speed . ) TRX type tires are becoming hard to find ; in addition to Michelin , Avon makes suitable tires . Goodyear has apparently discontinued their line of TRX tires . Q : Can I rotate radials from side to side , or rotate them only on one side of my car ? A : Car and tire manufacturers have differing views on this subject ; many say that swapping radials between the left and right hand sides of a car is now ok ( this group includes Michelin and Goodyear ) ; others ( for example , Pirelli and Nokia ) will void warranties if such swapping is done . The best advice is to read your tire manual carefully before rotating your tires , and stick to the manufacturer 's recommendations . Q : How many snow tires should I buy , and if I buy 2 , which end of the car should I put them on ? A : In short , 4 , and both ends . To explain , many drivers in areas that don't get excessive snow or who do n't drive agressively ( or at all ) in snow conditions get away with only two snows on the drive wheels , but there are circumstances where this can be dangerous practice . With a rear wheel drive car , you can choose between being able to start the car going ( a function of the rear axle ) or stopping and turning the car ( a function of the front axle . ) In a front wheel drive car , you start , stop , and turn with the front end . The primary risk of putting the snow tires on the front only is that if you have to put on the brakes while going downhill , you run a serious risk of going downhill backwards . Radar Detectors and Speed Limits : Q : Why are n't there any comments on Radar Detectors and Speed Limits in this Q & A posting ? A : Because questions about detectors and speed limits crossposted between misc.consumers and rec.autos . * always start long , tedious , and pointless flame wars . If you want to talk about either of these topics , please subscribe to rec.autos or alt.flame and keep it there . Safety Equipment : Q : Do airbags really work ? A : Preliminary statistics suggest the following : Airbags work much better than no belts ; good 3 point belts alone work much better than Airbags alone , and AirBags + 3 point belts work slightly better than 3 point belts alone . The con to airbags is that some designs tend to burn the driver 's hands when venting the byproducts of the explosion that occurs inside the bag , and that some designs ( but not all ) may knock the driver 's hands from the wheel , making retention of control of the vehicle after the bag deflates more difficult . Brake Questions : Q : Do I always need to get the rotors on my disk brakes turned ? Midas always wants to do this . A : No . There are specific conditions that mandate turning or replacing rotors ; some shops try and make a little extra money by replacing rotors more often than is strictly necessary . if the rotors are not warped warped , and only lightly grooved , then there is no need to replace or to turn them . Note also that some rotors ( the rotors on many Hondas are a good example ) are so narrow to begin with that it is not practical to turn them ; they must be replaced when they become too thin , warped , or badly grooved . Q : They tell me I should downshift when braking to slow my car down . Is this really a good idea ? A : It used to be a very good idea , back in the days of mediocre , fade prone drum brakes . In modern disc brake equipped cars , use of downshifting to slow the car is not really necessary , except in cases of long , steep downhill runs . Otherwise , modern disc brakes are more than adequate to stop a passenger car in all circumstances , and they are much cheaper to repair than clutch linings . On the other hand , many standard driver 's license tests in the USA still specify that the driver being tested downshift under braking ; I suggest that before taking a US driver 's test , you either 1 ) learn to do this smoothly ( which takes some time and practice ) or 2 ) borrow a car with an automatic to take the test . Q : How often should I replace my brake fluid ? A : Probably more often than you do . Traditional brake fluids tend to absorb water ; this water can corrode internal parts of the brake system and also lower the boiling point of the fluid . DOT-3 type are older fluids ; DOT-4 and DOT-5 are newer specifications . The principal differences are in wet and dry boiling points ; the dry boiling point is important in fresh brake fluid , but the wet boiling point is important in older brake fluid . DOT-3 fluids have the lowest wet and dry boiling point _requirements_ ; DOT-4 fluids have better boiling point requirements ; and DOT-5 fluids have the best boiling point requirements ( but DOT-5 fluids are not clearly superior ; see the next Q & A for more details . ) While the requirements imply that DOT-4 fluids are better than DOT-3 fluids , there may be specific cases where a DOT-3 fluid is preferable , but these are mostly competition applications . Otherwise , DOT-4 type fluids offer _much_ improved brake pedal feel . Replacement once a year is recommended for DOT-4 fluids , although agressive drivers may profit by changing out fluid more frequently , or at least bleeding a modest amount of fluid out of the brake calipers fairly regularly . Q : What about DOT-5 brake fluids ? A : This breaks down in to two parts . The DOT-5 specification looks excellent for performance , but the first DOT-5 fluids were Silicone based . Silicone fluids are a tricky proposition . Unlike DOT-3 and DOT-4 fluids , they do not absorb water at all . While this may sound like a feature , the problem is that any water present pools up in such systems , interfering with braking performance and corroding any metals at the spot where the pooling is occuring . The water will tend to migrate downwards in the braking system to the brake calipers , where most of the corrosion occurs . Because of this phenomenon , it is essential when converting to Silicone to empty the entire brake system and flush it throughly beforehand ; some even recommend replacing all rubber parts in the brake system when converting to Silicone fluids . Two other issues that come up with silicone fluids : 1 ) they are difficult to pour cleanly ( that is , without air bubbles ) , which interferes with getting a good brake pedal feel , and 2 ) while they generally have much higher boiling points than DOT-4 fluids , they do have high temperature failure modes which are indistinguishable in effect from boiling DOT-4 fluids . SIlicone fluids may make sense in some street car applications , but they are certainly not recommended for high performance driving applications , and the economics are questionable for street use . I have recently become aware of new fluids that meet the DOT-5 standard that do not contain Silicones ; these fluids appear to be reasonably compatible with the older DOT-3 and DOT-4 fluids , but I have little information at this time . Q : ABS is available on some of the cars I 'm looking at , but it costs more . Is it worth it ? A : This does not have a cut and dried answer ; therefore , this answer will be quite long in order to cover the pros and cons . The short answer is that ABS costs more , both initially , and to maintain , will generally work better for the ` average driver ' ( that is to say , a driver who does not have extensive experience in high performance driving techniques ) , and may require the ` unlearning ' of some obsolete braking techniques like pump braking which should be unlearned in any case . Now for the long answer . ABS works by monitering the wheels of the car , looking for signs of locked brakes . It may or may not be able be able to distinguish between the different wheels ( there are several systems on the market . ) It can not detect impending lockup ( which is what you would really want in an ideal world ) , but only the existence of lockup . The sensors used vary ; some of the less well designed sensors are sensitive to tire size , and to brake pad material , and may cease to function properly if the owner deviates from original equipment or OE-equivalent components . When the sensors detect lockup , the ABS system responds by unlocking the brakes ( either individually , or all at once , depending on the system . ) If the driver keeps their foot firmly planted , the ABS will end up cycling between the locked and unlocked states ( if a sensor existed that could detect _impending lockup_ , then we could sit right at that point , which is where maximum braking effect is achieved . ) This pulsing can often be felt in the brake pedal , as the system cycles . The percentage of the time that the brakes are truly engaged is called the ` duty cycle ' ; typically in an ABS system this is about 40 % On dry pavement , a trained driver can beat this duty cycle quite reliably using a technique called threshold braking ; on wet pavement , braking is so chancy that ABS will outperform threshold braking nearly every time . Unfortunately , on mud and on snow , often maximum braking effect can be acheived with the brakes locked ; only Audi , of the manufacturers producing ABS-equipped cars , has seen fit to provide a disable switch for the ABS system for this eventuality . A particularly important feature of ABS is that it preserves steering control . This is the case simply because , if you are braking near the limit and turn the wheel , the ABS will release the brakes if it sees steering-triggered lockup , and back off on the percentage of the time that the brakes are applied . Braking distances will lengthen accordingly . An important caution : ABS can not exceed the maximum theoretical braking force in any given situation ; if you start sliding on glare ice , do n't expect an ABS system to help you out very much . The coefficient of friction is not changed by the presence of an ABS system in your car . As far as maintenence goes , in addition to the potential restrictions I 've listed above , you have to worry about the following : 1 ) parts costs are much higher ; the OE master cylinder for my obscure european sedan lists for $ 185 , but the OE master cylinder for the ABS-equipped version of the same car lists for over $ 1000 . Most manufacturers explicitly forbid use of DOT-5 ( silicone ) brake fluids in ABS-equipped vehicles . Because of the potential cost of replacement of corroded brake system components , regular ( I suggest annual ) replacement of brake fluid becomes very important . Q : What about this threshold braking business ? A : [ normally , I 'd not put this in the consumers Q & A , but recent publicity about a number of accidents involving police drivers in ABS-equipped Chevy Caprices suggests that this section is needed here -- rpw ] Threshold braking is a technique practiced by all serious high performance drivers ; if made a habit , it replaces the ` stab the pedal and lock 'em up ' panic habit entirely , and is much to be prefered . Basically , the premise is that tires generate maximum braking force when they have just started to slide , but just before the wheels lock up entirely . Drivers who threshold brake learn to feel what this ` threshold ' feels like , and learn to search for it and hit it on the application of the brake pedal . In many cars , you can feel that you are near the threshold when the pedal starts to firm up as you depress it . In any case , if you ca n't hear the tires whine just a bit , you're not very near the threshold . In a car with ABS , often there is a twinge in the pedal just before the system starts cycling ; if the driver backs off on the pedal just a tad when the twinge is felt , then they are very close to the threshold and they 'll probably achieve better stopping distances than if they just punched it and let the ABS take over . Recently , there has been a rash of publicity over a number of accidents , and one death , involving police cars equipped with ABS systems . The police departments in question quickly blamed the new ABS systems , but according to Autoweek magazine , it now seems clear that the problem was a lack of training ; none of the involved officers had any recent performance driving training . There is reason to believe that the drivers reacted to the pulsing brake pedal by ` pump braking ' , an old and discredited technique of stabbing and releasing the brake pedal , the goal being to try and get brakes back with a failing hydraulic system . If you think about it for a minute , you 'll realize that pump braking must cut the effective operation of a working brake system by at least 1/2 , so if you cut the 40 % duty cycle of an ABS system by that much , you are giving up most of your brakes for the wrong reason . Threshold braking has the advantage in that it is an effective and useful technique regardless of whether your car has ABS ; if you do fear a failed hydraulic system , then one or two stabs at the pedal will be sufficient . Gas Questions : Q : Does High Octane gasoline help ? A : Maybe , maybe not . Some cars have knock sensors , and can adjust the engine timing or turbocharger boost to suit the gasoline being used . On most cars , however , you should use the cheapest gas that makes your car run well . Check your owner 's manual for details on what your car needs . Q : My car was made for leaded gasoline . Will unleaded gas hurt it ? A : It is possible that unleaded gas may *slightly* increase valve wear , although the Amoco Oil company argues otherwise . The actual increase in valve wear will be almost unnoticeable , however , as modern leaded gasolines actually contain very little lead . You should , however , check your owner 's manual ; many cars from the early 1970s do not actually require leaded gasoline . Q : Do fuel treatments help ? What kind should I use ? A : Some do and some do n't . During the winter , it is a good idea to use dry gas ; however , some may be harmful to fuel injection systems . Never use an additive containing Methanol ( sometimes called Methyl Alcohol ) ; such additives may damage fuel systems in cars with carbs and almost certainly will damage cars with fuel injection . Manufacturer 's opinions vary on additives containing Ethanol ( sometimes called Ethyl Alcohol ) ; if your car has fuel injection , check the owner's manual on your car before using these . Most manufacturers consider 10 % Ethanol acceptable in gasoline . Additives with Isopropyl Alcohol ( Isopropanol ) , and Petroleum Distillates are fine in fuel injected cars . An occasional bottle of fuel injector cleaner is helpful in cars with fuel injectors , although many premium gasolines contain detergents that do the same job . Some off brands of fuel injector cleaners contain Ethanol or Methanol ; always check the ingredients before putting anything in your gas tank . There are a small number of particularly good additives ; these are noticeably more expensive that the run-of-the-mill ones , but work much , much better . Among these are Chevron Techron , Redline SL-1 , Wurth ` Lubrimoly Ventil Sauber ' , and BG 44K . A bottle of one of these , once every six months , is highly recommended . Q : What about detergent gasolines ? A : The quality of detergent packages in gasolines varies somewhat ; BMW has instituted a testing program , and gasoline brands which pass this test may advertise that fact . Stickers indicating passage of the test are now beginning to appear on fuel pumps at gas stations . If such gasolines are used , then fuel injector cleaners are probably optional . Beforewarned that while use of BMW approved gasolines will keep a clean engine clean , they may not clean a motor with bad valve deposits . Lubrication Questions : Q : What do the numbers and letters in a motor oil designation mean ? A : There are several different items encoded . There is a two-letter code indicating the type of detergent package that the manufacturer uses in the oil ; this looks like SE , SF , CD or such . The S codes are for gasoline engine applications ; the C codes are for diesel engine applications . The second letter is assigned in sequence as new levels of protection are developed ; thus SF is considered better than SE , SE is considered better than SD , and so forth . The more noticeable designation is the oil weight . This is either a single number ( e.g. , 30 weight ) or a pair of numbers separated by the letter W ( e.g. , 10W30 . ) The latter type is much more commonly used these days , and are the only type that most automobile manufacturers specify in operators manuals . The first number in the designation ( 10W ) is the apparent viscosity of the oil when it is cold ; the W stands for ` winter ' . The second number ( 30 ) is the viscosity of the oil when hot . There is a trick here ; the oil does n't actually get thicker ( turn from 10 weight to 30 weight ) as it gets hotter . What is actually happening is that when the oil is cold , it has the viscosity of a cold 10 weight oil . as it gets hotter , it does n't get thin as fast as a 10W oil would ; by the time it is up to temperature , it has the viscosity of a hot 30 weight oil . Note that these numbers actually specify ranges of viscosities ; not all 10W oils have exactly the same viscosity when cold , and not all 30 weight oils have the same viscosity when hot . Note also that the novel behaviour of multi-grade oils is caused by additives , and it has been reported that with the sole exception of Castrol GTX , 10W40 oils do not retain their multi-grade characteristics well over time . 10W30 , 15W40 , and 20W50 oils work very well , though . Q : Are ` quick lube ' places any good ? A : Some do adequate work , but there are quite a few incompetent ones out there . Let the buyer beware , watch them while they work , make sure that they do n't overtorque the oil drain plug , and keep your hand on your wallet at all times . Q : Are oil additives like Slick-50 or Tufoil any good ? A : Slick-50 and Tufoil are PTFE-based additives . Many of these have come onto the market recently ; they are different from the moly-based additives that have been around since the early 50 's . PTFE is the chemical name for Teflon ( TM ) , a trademark owned by DuPont . In general , auto manufacturers do not recommend use of these products . Most USENET responses to questions on these additives are favorable ( slight increase of MPG after application , smoother revving ) but long term results ( whether PTFE additives are effective after 5K miles ) are debatable . Some manufacturers ( such as Saab ) claim that either the product or the engine flush that preceeds application causes deterioration of the oil seals and eventual leakage . Some BMW owners have reported death of valve seals shortly after the addition of Slick 50 to their cars . This writer has been cautioned by a Slick-50 Dealer ( ! ) that Slick-50 should _not_ be used in Japanese motors , as it may clog the oil return passages in the engine . Otherwise , there are no known reports of damage caused by PTFE additives . On the other hand , there are satified Slick 50 customers in the world . Q : Do synthetic oils really work ? A : Yes , but . More specifically , most auto manufactuers accept synthetics , but disagree with the extremely long oil change intervals claimed by oil manufacturers . Auto manufacturers recommend that you continue to change oil at the intervals recommended in the owners manual for your car . Even if you decide to try the longer intervals , at least change the oil filter at regular intervals , as synthetics get just as dirty as conventional oils . Synthetic gear lubricants for manual transmissions are another matter entirely ; Amsoil , Redline , and AGIP are very highly regarded and very effective . Mobil 1 synthetic gear lube gets mixed reviews , however . Q : Manufacturers are specifying longer and longer oil change intervals . How often should I change my oil ? A : It depends on how you drive . If your car always ( or nearly always ) gets warmed up , and you do n't drive it very hard and keep the revs down , the manufacturer 's recommendation is probably fine . If , however , you drive it hard , drive it at high revs , or alternatively , if you only drive it to and from the supermarket so that it does n't get up to temperature , then you may wish to change oil much more often , perhaps at 3000 mile intervals ( given that most manufacturers are now specifying 7500 mile intervals . ) If you do n't drive your car much at all ( say 7500 miles a year ) , then you probably want to change oil every six months anyway . If you are storing a car during the winter , then change oil before storing it and change oil when you bring it out of storage . Misc . Questions : Q : My car has a timing belt . I hear that bad things happen when they break . What 's the story ? A : It depends on the internal design of the motor . Early Ford Escorts , for example , will suffer severe valve damage if the belt breaks , but the newer cars will just require a tow and installation of a new belt . Some Honda motors will not be damaged , but others will be . If no replacement interval is specified for your car , then change the belt at least every 60,000 miles ; some cars may require more frequent replacement . Ask your dealer or independent mechanic . Also , ask if there are any related repairs that should take place at the same time ( for example , the same Ford Escorts that suffer valve damage also have a timing belt driven water pump , which has been known to seize , destroying the timing belt , and which then causes major valve damage as a side effect . Replacing the timing belt while ignoring the water pump can be a costly mistake . ) Q : Why would anyone be stupid enough to design a motor so that it self destructs when the timing belt breaks ? A : For performance reasons . Compromising piston design so that the valves and pistons will not collide requires that the compression ratio of the engine be reduced significantly ; this is why you are more likely to avoid valve damage in economy cars than in performance oriented vehicles . Q : What causes Unintended Acceleration ? A : The final report of the National Highway , Transportation , and Safety Administration concluded that unintended acceleration could not be caused by any mechanical failure of the vehicle in question and at the same time be consistent with the physical evidence . The NHTSA report goes on to conclude that ` pedal misapplication ' by the vehicle operator is probably the cause . -- richard welty 518-393-7228 welty @ cabot.balltown.cma.com `` Nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of a race car about either its pitch or roll axis '' -- Carroll Smith

While shopping for a passenger helmet , I noticed that in many cases the external dimensions of the helmets were the same from S through XL . The difference was the amount of inside padding . My solution was to buy a large helmet , and construct a removable liner from a sheet of .5 '' closed-cell foam and some satin ( glued to the inside surface ) . The result is a reasonably snug fit on my smallest-headed pillion with the liner in , and a comfortable fit on my largest-headed pillion with the liner out .

From : `` Jon C. R. Bennett '' < jb7m+ @ andrew.cmu.edu > Subject : Ideas on Clipper Organization : Robotics Institute , Carnegie Mellon , Pittsburgh , PA Lines : 92 NNTP-Posting-Host : andrew.cmu.edu I have an idea as to why the encryption algorithm needs to be keep secret , and some things that i think it implies . ( Of course these could all be wrong ... .. ) from THE CLIPPER CHIP : A TECHNICAL SUMMARY Dorothy Denning Revised , April 21 , 1993 . . . The Clipper Chip contains a classified single-key 64-bit block encryption algorithm called `` Skipjack . '' The algorithm uses 80 bit keys ( compared with 56 for the DES ) and has 32 rounds of scrambling ( compared with 16 for the DES ) . It supports all 4 DES modes of operation . The algorithm takes 32 clock ticks , and in Electronic Codebook ( ECB ) mode runs at 12 Mbits per second . Each chip includes the following components : the Skipjack encryption algorithm F , an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips N , a 30-bit serial number ( this length is subject to change ) U , an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip . . . ENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP To see how the chip is used , imagine that it is embedded in the AT & T telephone security device ( as it will be ) . Suppose I call someone and we both have such a device . After pushing a button to start a secure conversation , my security device will negotiate an 80-bit session key K with the device at the other end . This key negotiation takes place without the Clipper Chip . In general , any method of key exchange can be used such as the Diffie-Hellman public-key distribution method . Once the session key K is established , the Clipper Chip is used to encrypt the conversation or message stream M ( digitized voice ) . The telephone security device feeds K and M into the chip to produce two values : E [ M ; K ] , the encrypted message stream , and E [ E [ K ; U ] + N ; F ] , a law enforcement field , which are transmitted over the telephone line . The law enforcement field thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U concatenated with the serial number N , all encrypted under the family key F. The law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after an authorized wiretap has been installed . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- suppose i knew how the algorithm worked and knew the N for my chip , but did not know F , then by cryptanalysis i might be able to determine F from if law enforcement field E [ E [ K ; U ] + N ; F ] not knowing N would might make this much harder . Now suppose that I know F , ( either legitimately or not ) , If I know K ( either because I am involved in the conversation , or I know U for a party in the conversation ) , I may now be able to determine U for the other party . If I know F I can also defeat the law enforcement field , since I could make my own , with a different K then the one I am using . Knowing F also allows traffic analysis to be performed . So I might not know what you are saying but I could know who you are saying it too . Now I admit that someone trying to compute U will not have lots of messages to work from , but since we have no way of knowing that the key generation method does not ( deliberately ? ) generate weak keys , or for that matter that the published method is in fact used , perhaps the U 's will be chosen from know weak keys for the system . Obviously the compromise of F would be a disaster , both to law enforcement for whom this whole thing is designed , and for the people who believe that it is giving them security . F is but one number , and I sure that alot of people ( more then 1 ) know what it is ( and if some `` panel of experts '' is going to check it over for flaws then many more will know F , forget grinding chips , bribery and blackmail work just fine . So , am I wrong ? Or are these problems . jon

April 6 , 1993 RELEASE : 93-64 Dr. John H. Gibbons , Director , Office of Science and Technology Policy , outlined to the members-designate of the Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space Station on April 3 , three budget options as guidance to the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of the space station . A low option of $ 5 billion , a mid-range option of $ 7 billion and a high option of $ 9 billion will be considered by the committee . Each option would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscal year 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for development , operations , utilization , Shuttle integration , facilities , research operations support , transition cost and also must include adequate program reserves to insure program implementation within the available funds . Over the next 5 years , $ 4 billion is reserved within the NASA budget for the President 's new technology investment . As a result , station options above $ 7 billion must be accompanied by offsetting reductions in the rest of the NASA budget . For example , a space station option of $ 9 billion would require $ 2 billion in offsets from the NASA budget over the next 5 years . Gibbons presented the information at an organizational session of the advisory committee . Generally , the members-designate focused upon administrative topics and used the session to get acquainted . They also received a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process the Station Redesign Team is following to develop options for the advisory committee to consider . Gibbons also announced that the United States and its international partners -- the Europeans , Japanese and Canadians -- have decided , after consultation , to give `` full consideration '' to use of Russian assets in the course of the space station redesign process . To that end , the Russians will be asked to participate in the redesign effort on an as-needed consulting basis , so that the redesign team can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR and the possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and systems . The U.S. and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise of the Russian participants in assessing Russian systems and technology . The overall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducing station costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilitiaes . Careful integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in achieving that goal . Gibbons reiterated that , `` President Clinton is committed to the redesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve the science , the technology and the jobs that the space station program represents . However , he also is committed to a space station that is well managed and one that does not consume the national resources which should be used to invest in the future of this industry and this nation . '' NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin said the Russian participation will be accomplished through the East-West Space Science Center at the University of Maryland under the leadership of Roald Sagdeev . -- -- -- - End of Blind-Carbon-Copy

From : dbd @ urartu.sdpa.org ( David Davidian ) Subject : ARMENIA SAYS IT COULD SHOOT DOWN TURKISH PLANES News-Software : VAX/VMS VNEWS 1.41 Organization : University of Tennessee Computing Center Lines : 293 Dear friends , I am a graduate student in Education at the University of Tennessee . As part of the requirements for a research class in music education I designed a questionnaire to colect data for my research project . The study intends to determine which techniques ( if any ) have been used to teach music for the deaf . If you have any experience in music education for the deaf and would like to help me with this project , your help would be very much appreciated . If you also want to exchange some ideas about the subject matter , feel yourself welcome . I have been working in this area for a while ( in Brazil _ by the way , I am Brazilian _ and also in US ) and I am very pleased with the results . I hope that this inquiry will not cause too many inconveniences . Thank you for or time and consideration . __QUESTIONNAIRE__ Teaching Music for deaf children . NAME ________________________________ ADDRESS/ E-MAIL _____________________ EMPLOYING INSTITUTION _______________ YEARS OF EXPERIENCE_________ GRADE LEVEL ( S ) ____ EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND : BACHELOR__ MASTERS__ DOCTORATE__ PROFESSIONAL FIELD : SPECIAL EDUC.__ MUSIC EDUC.__ OTHER*__ *If you checked `` other '' , please indicate your major : ____ Some school systems require music to be taught to deaf children , other school systems have not thought of the possibility to teach music for children with hearing limitations . The following questionnaire was designed to find out how teachers face the issue of teaching or not teaching music for the deaf . Also , a part of this study is to determine teachers attitudes towards music programs for deaf children . DIRECTIONS : READ THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS AND CIRCLE THE NUMBER THAT BEST DESCRIBES YOUR ATTITUDE TOWARDS MUSIC FOR DEAF CHILDREN ( LEFT COLUMN ) , AND CIRCLE THE APPROPRIATE `` YES '' , `` NO '' OR `` NOT APPLICABLE '' , WHETHER YOU DO THE TASK ( RIGHT COLUMN ) . SD= Strongly disagree Y= yes DIS= Disagree N= no NEU= Neutral N/A= not applicable AG= Agree SA= Strongly agree SD DIS NEU AG SA COMPETENCIES Y N N/A ___________________________________________________________________________ 1 2 3 4 5 1.Deaf children can be educated in y n n/a music . 1 2 3 4 5 2.Deaf children should have regular y n n/a music classes . 1 2 3 4 5 3.A special music teacher must posses y n n/a an appropriate training in a variety of communication methods to use with deaf children . 1 2 3 4 5 4.In preparing the lessons the teacher y n n/a must keep in mind that deaf children may present special needs in order to participate in musical activities . 1 2 3 4 5 5.Deaf and normal hearing children y n n/a should have music classes together . 1 2 3 4 5 6 . 80 % of a succesful music experience y n n/a by a deaf child depends upon the teacher 's creativity and commitment with the subject matter . 1 2 3 4 5 7.Deaf children can learn to appreciate y n n/a music but they will never be a musician or a performer . 1 2 3 4 5 8.Deaf children are not able to y n n/a discriminate and recognize sounds . 1 2 3 4 5 9.Deaf children can not distinguish y n n/a among loud and soft sounds . 1 2 3 4 5 10.Deaf children can never match the y n n/a music in their head to a note on a musical instrument . 1 2 3 4 5 11.The most appropriate material to y n n/a start music classes for the deaf would be the folk songs said he would be replaced by the military commandant of Baku , police Major-General Abdullah Allakhverdiyev .

By working together `` with good will on both sides '' , we may be able to start solving problems without restricting anyone 's freedoms . Mr. Walz on the other hand is using Rohit 's post as an excuse for personal attacks on Mr. Cramer .

That is a question that can only be answered by yourself and where you live . If you live in a place where crime is apparent , then it might be a good idea to get one simply as a deterrent . However , if a professional thief wants your vehicle , its as good as gone no matter what you do . But to slow down any thieves it would be a good idea to get the basic options . That would be : 1 ) ignition kill or fuel cut-off 2 ) a flashing red LED These two are basic to a decent alarm system . To slow down the criminal some more , get a steering wheel lock . That should be sufficient to persuade the thief to find an easier target . But , then there 's always car-jacking . Why is life so confusing ?

A poorly maintained > rifle is dangerous , but only to the user ; since it doesn't > endanger others , there is no justification for such restrictions . I remind you of shrapnel . I consider 5 ' a reasonable space limitation , but make no mistake a gun blowing up is a hazard to those nearby , say in the next lane at the range . My point was at what distance , or level of threat , we draw the line . Is it the endangerment of others , so we do a 5 ' restriction , or the possibility of being shot , hence we draw a 1.5 mile restriction , or a nuke and draw a 5 mile restriction ? To me they al suffer from the fundamental flaw that they restrict based upon the instrument rather than placing the responsibility for usage squarely upon the shoulders of the user . Perhaps Sen. Metzenbaum declaring the Barrett Light Fifty an assault rifle has made this more apparent to me , since the Barrett has only range and acurracy going for it . > They have determined that their lives are worth the effort to > protect their homes and families . Using nuclear weapons close > to home will not accomplish this . I disagree , on the grounds that a house can be rebuilt much more easily than my family once I have died . I assume that word would get to the citizens that such an attack was planned . If this is not the case , the tactical and strategic implications change quite a bit . Personally , my home is worth , say , twenty Martians intent on taking over the world . My family ? All of them . The balancing act here is hard to judge sitting at my desk . > There is , however , another problem : In any case of civil war , > the strength of the militias fighting on each side should > reflect the popular will .

That seems to be the case already , given that heavy weapons are n't commonly owned by the citizenry . With such low numbers , obviously due to cost , I do n't think the superior weapons are going to be of great effect against a numerically superior foe . Furthermore , it is even more doubtful their training includes proper tactical movements that best utilize tanks , whereas the commonly rifleman is not so hampered in effectiveness . > I think it is vital to avoid such a situation , where a small > minority would have a reasonable chance of gaining political power > through violence .

This is > certainly not a good thing , but I think it is the lesser of two evils . > Whoever controls these weapons must be a democratic body , > responsive to the will of the people . I had envisioned that the armorer , perhaps the officers of a select group , and the like would exercise control over the heavier , more complex weapons . But , if Joe Bob owns an old Sherman tank I certainly would n't ask him to give it up . Follow orders from the officers , yes . Since the expense of a tank is so large , though , chances are it would be jointly purchased and should therefore be jointly maintained and operated . > Here , I think we have to be carefull about _which_ `` state '' we > are talking about : Certainly one role of the militia is to > overthrow a repressive government , and it would be completely > destructive to that end for that same government to control > the militia 's arms .

The State having control over the heavy weapons should not be justification for the state to have them centrally located . Keep them spread out , such that the ability of the State to lock them up is n't so easy . Otherwise , I would have to assume that State control would rest on the authority of the Governor and militia officers . > That is eaxctly why I think they should be removed : The select > militia should privide the militia 's heavy weapons and highly-trained > specialists .

Similarly , the > select militia should be incapable of action without the > aid of the general militia . I 'm having a hard time seeing how these heavy weapons , fairly few in numbers , could not be easily wielded by a few people with government support . Just as you argued above that the weapons should be divvied up and under democratic control so one side does n't have all of them , I ca n't see where this situation is alleviated in having the select militia holding all the weapons and the unorganized militia being the infantry . I think a better mix is called for . But , I would argue that the Federal army should rely upon the select militia and the unorganized militia for the bulk of its infantry units . > Consider , then , the effect of removing the National Guard's > infantry and placing the Guard under the control of local > governments . The government-controled select militia could > not fight effectively without infantry support provided by > the general militia ( an inherently infantry organization . ) > On the other hand , the general militia could function ( although > at a disadvantage ) without the backing of local governments and > the select militia . We have to assume that there would be those who would side with the government-controlled forces , and if they 've all the equipment an infantry force 3x the size would be in trouble . I 'd like to see that heavy stuff , say tanks , offset by the local troups having a few 105 's and anti-tank weapons in their armory . These would be much more useful to infantry than the tank would be when cost and training requirements are figured in . I suppose I 'm quibbling over what constitutes heavy equipment . > > ... but a mechanized infantry unit is what builds > > dikes in times of flood , sets up disaster relief cities , and > > the like . > > I would much rather see these things handled by the local , > general militias . So would I , but the resources often are n't available to outfit local units well enough . Thus , we will certainly have to call in others , and a mechanized unit carries more stuff faster than anything else . > Perhaps the National Guard is n't as close to my conception of > the select militia as I thought : I was considering them to > be the heavy weapons/armor arm of the militia , not the infantry > arm of the regular army . Perhaps our ideas of heavy weapons are different ? I think main battle tanks , self-propelled artillery , and 155mm and up field pieces are heavy stuff . M113 troop carriers , 2 1/2 ton trucks , HumVee 's , old M60 tanks , 105 Howitzers , are more the stuff of a mechanized infantry . Actually , this is what the Guard units in Iowa are currently fielding in some units . Perhaps it is just my innate fear of having the real heavy equipment under State control , with little but numbers and light stuff to act as a deterrent . Allowing main battle tanks to the states should be balanced with anti-tank capability in the local ranks . Similarly , local units would need to band together quickly , hence small and fast response means mechanized infantry . Finally , the militia is more than just fighting . Equipment is needed for other responses . The Federal army , I 'm convinced , should have a very minumum of infantry , relying on the state and local militias for these functions . < Dan Sorenson , DoD # 1066 z1dan @ exnet.iastate.edu viking @ iastate.edu > < ISU only censors what I read , not what I say .

Excellent point , and there 's a related point I 'd like to make . They 'll have to back up these databases themselves , wo n't they ? How many tape copies will there be , and how secure will the tapes be ? If they store them off-site , it would n't be too hard to hijack them in transit .

I 've never heard anyone discussing this idea , so maybe there 's some reason why it isn't so great . But maybe someone can tell me . Would it be a mistake to fully charge the batteries , drain the electrolyte into separate containers ( one for each battery ) , seal the container , close up the batteries , and leave them that way ? Then it would seem that when the bikes come out of storage , I could put the electrolyte back in the batteries and they should still be fully charged . What 's wrong with this ?

RBI are a worthless stat . Of course , so is stolen bases because sometimes runners are in front of a player that would otherwise run . And of course pitchers pitch differently with different people on different bases , so batting average , slugging and obp out , too . Hmmm ... i guess homers would not count then , either .

I 'm not calling him a liar , but if there was any proof that a Met player had raped a little girl before a game ( let alone doing it on a regular basis ) they would be in jail , not Shea . For those people who do not know what the press is like in New York , it is probably more cut-throat than in just about any other part of the U.S. Keith Hernandez said it very well on ESPN a couple of days ago , they would much rather mention a clubhouse fight , than a two-run homer in the ninth to win a game . I do not read Klapisch 's news columns regularly , but I do know that he has been accused before as being an instigator that enjoys ( hopefully for only professional reasons ) to drumb up a news story , even if there is n't one there . Now as far as the confrontation with Bobby Bonilla a few days ago , I almost totally blame Bonilla . No matter what a member of the press does , and no matter how much of a putrid individual he might be , that does not give a ballplayer the right to threaten a journalist .

My Autobahn knowledge is admittedly second-hand , but I believe > the following to be true : My knowledge about driving in the U.S. is also second-hand , but I think I can correct your statements about our Autobahn : > 1 . Drivers are much better disciplined in Europe than they are here . Oh yeah , that would be paradise ... in fact , you can forget it . From all I've heard from my U.S. relatives , drivers esp . here in Germany are much more agg- ressive , but not disciplined . One of my relatives , a L.A. resident , hired a car at the Nuernberg airport and went about 18 miles to our home . He said then that he grew about 1 year older during this ride and swore he 'd never drive a car in Germany again ( this was in 1982 and he kept his promise - the situation now is even worse as effect of the increased volume of traffic ) . What you mean by ` better disciplined ' should perhaps be considered ` cautious due to fear ' : When driving around here , you always *have* to take into consideration that the majority of the other drivers absolutely relies on you : They expect that nobody fails or sleeps ; many of them exploit this by driving as fast as their car can go ( of course only where that is allowed , you might think - dream on : ) . So any mistake you make is a very high risk to your health - and if you 're ex- posed to such a situation from your very first day as a driver , you learn to handle it - or you lose ... That 's the way I and most people I know experience our traffic situation - whether you think this is pleasant or efficient is up to you ; I think we handle a very high volume of traffic and that at high speeds with modest ( compared to the volume ) and decreasing rates of lethal accidents - OTOH , more and more people ( esp . women ) dislike driving ( because they feel overtaxed and threatened ) and each accident is one accident too much . > 2 . The roads comprising the Autobahn are much better designed than > they are here , and usually include animal fences . This makes them > far more predictable than most US highways . Better designed and maintained , may be - but animal fences are very rare . Auto- bahnen and many other streets have guard-rails ( I hope that 's the right word - a plank made from thick steel sheet fixed on uprights ; it 's about 2 feet high ) ; those guard-rails are designed for keeping vehicles on the road . Smaller animals can crawl under the plank , bigger ones can easily jump over it . The point is that esp . larger animals are very rare in Germany ; they tend also to be very timid .

You 're right ( there are speed linits even on the major part of the Autobahn ) - but the attitude towards driving ( see above ) seems to be very similar to that in Germany ( I 've been in France , Switzerland , Italy , Austria , Spain , Belgium , the Netherlands ) - besides that , you really ca n't rely on the residents abiding the local speed limits .

Sorry , but you 'll find quite a lot rabbit-class-car ( or even smaller , mine is a Peugeot 205 ) owners going that fast ; small cars with much HP are very ` hip ' over here - and most people buying such cars are n't afraid to let them run . > ... Some people > have no respect for their own lives . I disagree ; the size or weight of a car is rather irrelevant . Formula-1 cars weigh less than 700 kg and the drivers have a chance to survive accidents at 130 mph or higher - OTOH when crashing against a solid object at 130 mph , it makes no difference whether you sit in a Porsche , a Mercedes , a tank or on a bicycle : Your 're dead .

All of the vendors I have called say that the internal video will not work on a true VGA monitor but will work on a IBM Compatible multisync like the sony 's or the NEC monitors . I thought the VGA capability of LCIII was very attractive because it allowed you to use inexpensive VGA monitors . Am I confused or are these vendors just not up to speed ? Has anyone used an LCIII with a non multisync VGA monitor and if so where did you get your adapter ( please be specific w/ vendor and cat # ) ? I would prefer to get a apple monitor for these LCIII 's ( it 's unseemly to see the finder inside an IBM bezel ) but the more money we save on monitors the more LCIII 's we can afford and the more PS/2 's we can get rid of !

From : 55526 @ brahms.udel.edu ( Oliver P Weatherbee ) Subject : New Windows drivers for Cirrus GD5426 graphic cards ! Article-I.D . : news.C5x27u.D4F Organization : University of Delaware Lines : 42 Nntp-Posting-Host : brahms.udel.edu I have uploaded the most recent Windows drivers for the Cirrus GD5426 chip based display cards to the uploads directory at ftp.cica.indiana.edu ( file is 5426dr13.zip ) . They 're very recent , I downloaded them from the Cirrus BBS ( 570-226-2365 ) last night . If you are unable to get them there , email me and maybe I can upload them to some other sites as well . I have a local bus based card ( VL24 Bitblaster from Micron ) but I think the drivers work with ISA cards ( or at least includes drivers for them ) . I found the new drivers to be a significant improvement over the 1.2 version , improving my graphic winmarks ( v3.11 ) by about 2 million ( 7.77 to 9.88 ) although this could be the result of intentional benchmark cheating on Cirrus 's part but I do n't think so . From Steve Gibson 's ( columnist for Info World ) graphic card comparisons ( also found at the cica ftp site under the name winadv.zip ) I extracted the following for the sake of comparison : Wintach Winbn3.11 Word Sprsht Cad Paint Overall Steve 's system : 486/33 VLB : ATI Graphics Ultra Pro 9.33 10.34 20.78 8.28 14.90 13.58 my system - 486sx/33 VLB : VL24 Bitblaster 9.88 8.65 11.71 18.84 15.40 13.65 Its no Viper , but I think its a hell of a deal at about a third of the cost of the ATI card and when compared to the other cards included in Gibson 's review . Micron system owner 's , I would be interested to hear your opinions on the DTC 2270VL local bus disk controller . My system came with a Maxtor 7120 drive ( 120 MB ) and at first was only giving me disk winmarks of about 16 Kb/s , I am now at 22 Kb/s . Is this about as good as it gets ? I ca n't get a Norton's sysinfo disk reading because the contoller intercepts the calls , at least that was what the program said . Oliver Weatherbee oliver @ earthview

Reply-To : sera @ zuma.UUCP ( Serdar Argic ) Distribution : world Lines : 47 In 1941 , while the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Nazi concentration camps , the Nazi Armenians in Germany formed the first Armenian battalion to fight alongside the Nazis . In 1943 , this battalion had grown into eight battalions of 20,000-strong under the command of Dro ( the butcher ) who is the architect of the cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds between 1914-1920 . An Armenian National Council was formed by the notorious Dashnak Party leaders in Berlin , which was recognized by the Nazis . Encouraged by this , the Armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed and espoused fully the principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the members of the Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler 's policy of extermination of the Jews . This Armenian-Nazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an `` encore '' performance staged by the Armenians during WWI , when they back-stabbed and exterminated 2.5 million Turks by colluding with the invading Russian army .

Organization : NASA Langley Research Center , Hampton VA , USA Lines : 45 Distribution : world NNTP-Posting-Host : cmb00.larc.nasa.gov I am posting to this group in hopes of finding someone out there in network newsland who has heard of something similar to what I am going to describe here . I have a fourteen year old daugter who experienced a seizure on November 3 , 1992 at 6:45AM after eating Kellog 's Frosted Flakes . She is perfectly healthy , had never experienced anything like this before , and there is no history of seizures in either side of the family . All the tests ( EEG , MRI , EKG ) came out negative so the decision was made to do nothing and just wait to see if it happened again . Well , we were going along fine and the other morning , April 5 , she had a bowl of another Kellog 's frosted kind of cereal , Fruit Loops ( I am embarrassed to admit that I even bought that junk but every once in a while ... ) So I pour it in her bowl and think `` Oh , oh , this is the same kind of junk she was eating when she had that seizure . '' Ten minutes later she had a full blown seizures . This was her first exposure to a sugar coated cereal since the last seizure . When I mentioned what she ate the first time as a possible reason for the seizure the neurologist basically negated that as an idea . Now after this second episode , so similar in nature to the first , even he is scratching his head . Once again her EEG looks normal which I understand can happen even when a person has a seizure . Once again we are waiting . I have been thinking that it would be good to get to as large a group as possible to see if anyone has any experience with this kind of thing . I know that members of the medical community are sometimes loathe to admit the importance that diet and foods play in our general health and well-being . Anyway , as you can guess , I am worried sick about this , and would appreciate any ideas anyone out there has . Sorry to be so wordy but I wanted to really get across what is going on here .

He is only insurance in case of extra innings or the 2nd catcher is injured during a game . So to free up this roster spot for an extra pinch hitter or reliever , why not invoke a catcher re-substitution rule : If the last roster catcher on a team is injured during a game , the team is permitted to substitute in his place for defensive purposes a catcher who has previously been yanked from the game . Given this rule , a team would n't need 3 roster catchers . The 3rd catcher could be playing in AAA or be a non-roster bullpen catcher . Ken

I have n't read Lewis 's article , so I ca n't comment directly upon it , and have only spoken about his writings _in general_ so far , that his political motives make him a biased writer on Islam . His anti-Islamic polemics , as I understand it , are often quite subtle and are often based on telling half-truths . Again , read `` Orientalism '' by Edward Said . I am _not_ asking you to take what I say on trust , in fact I am urging you not to do so but to get this book ( it is a well-known book ) and check the evidence out for _yourself_ . > The issue I raised was that slaves WERE USED FOR SEXUAL PURPOSES , > when it was claimed that Islam prohibits extra-marital sex . > I wrote that the Prophet himself had concubines , I wrote an > incident in which the prophet advised on someone who did not > want his concubine to get pregnant etc. , which is contrary > to the notion that `` sex is for procreation only '' .

I understand your point of view , Selim -- I think , rather , it is _us_ who are not getting through to _you_ . Some of the points you repeat above I have already answered before . Regarding women , I have made posting after posting on this subject , showing that Islam is not anti-woman , etc . However , have you been completely ignoring my postings or just missing them ? I just reposted a very good one , under the title `` Islam and Women '' , reposted from soc.religion.islam . If this has already disappeared from your site , then please email me telling me so and I will email you a copy of this excellent article . IMHO , your understanding of the issue of women in Islam is sadly deficient . Regarding slaves , _my_ posting on slavery -- the second one I made , which is a repost of an article I wrote early last year -- is based completely on the Qur'an and contains numerous Qur'anic verses and hadiths to support its point of view . Our approaches are different -- you are arguing from a historical standpoint and I am arguing directly from the teachings of the Qur'an and hadiths . Now , just because people say they are Muslims and perform a particular action , does that automatically mean that their action is part of Islam , even if it is opposed by the Qur'an and Sunnah ? No ! Of course not . Let me give you a concrete example , which might help clarify this for you . The Qur'an prohibits drinking . Now , if a person says `` I am a Muslim '' and then proceeds to drink a bottle of beer , does this now mean that Islam teaches that people should drink beer ? Of course not , and only an idiot would think so . Do you see my point ? > It is very natural to think that > the author/authors of the Quran had no idea that the socio-economic > structure they were advocating would experience at least two paradigm > shifts in 1400 years in the western cultures - first with the end of > the feudal era and the rise of commerce , second with the industrial > revolution .

In fact , the rise of Islam can easily be modeled > after the pyramid effect - you do not produce any wealth at home , > but increase your wealth by conquering places . You are judging Islam here on capitalist terms . Capitalism is an ideology based largely on the assumption that people want to maximise their wealth -- this assumption is in opposition to Islamic teachings . To say Islam is bad because it is not capitalist is pretty unthinking -- Islam does not pretend to be capitalist and does not try to be capitalist . ( This does not mean that Islam does not support a free-market -- for it does in general -- but there are other parts of capitalism which are opposed to Islam as I understand it . ) > When this stopped , > you ( and I ) were left bare in the open for emperialists to devour . > No capital , no industry , very poor social services - the education > level in Muslim countries are the lowest in the world , the health > statistics are miserable etc.. One can postulate numerous reasons for this . Your theory is that it is because Islam is not secularist and capitalist , etc . etc . Selim , I will give you a clear historical example to show you the fallacy of your views if you think ( as you obviously do ) that Islam = > lack of education and power . For a large part of history , the Islamic world was very powerful . For a significant section of history , the Islamic world was the foremost in the sciences . So to say that Islam is , for example , anti-education is completely absurd . You try to blame this situation on Islam -- history shows that your conclusion is false and that , instead , there must be other reasons for this situation . > You blame Muslims for not following the Quran , but I blame Muslims > for following the Quran . Well , Selim , your viewpoint on women in Islam makes me question the extent of your knowledge of Islam . I really think you are not knowledgeable enough to be able to judge whether the Muslims are following the Qur'an or not . > Your idea is baseless from historical > facts , it is a poor utopia , The Islamic world was at the forefront of the world in science at one stage -- yet somehow , in your theory , it is by `` following the Qur'an '' that Muslims are backwards in education . Selim , it is _your_ thesis that is anti-historical , for you conveniently overlook this historical fact which contradicts your theory . > while my ideas are derived from social > and economic history . You have certainly not shown this ; you have merely stated it . So far , it seems to me that your view on Islam being anti-education is quite contrary to history . That you are so convinced of your views makes me wonder just how objectively you are trying to look at all of this . > My solution to all Muslims is simple : > CUT THE CRAP , I think , Selim , you should consider taking your own advice . > GET THE FACTS STRAIGHT Here too . > AND WORK HARD TO REVERSE > THE EFFECTS OF 1300 YEARS OF IGNORANCE . Selim , you have such conviction of your viewpoint , yet you demonstrate ignorance , not only of Islam but also of Islamic history ( particularly with respect to Muslims being leaders of science till about 1400 or so I think ) . Yet you say that your viewpoint is based on history ! Selim , if I remember right , you say in one of your earlier posts that you are an apostate from Islam . I think you should slow down and start thinking clearly about the issues , and start _reading_ some of our postings about Islam rather than ignoring them as you so obviously have .

Ca n't believe people actually put > win as first in a tie breaker ... ... Golly , I love stupid people . : - ) Listen , Rex , this is hockey . The NHL , to be precise . And in the NHL , there exist these things called `` ties '' . A tie occurs when a game ends with the score for each team equal . Each team gets one point for a tie . There also exits these things called `` wins '' . A win is when one team has a higher score than the opponent . ( Oh yeah , only two teams play each other at a time , so I can say `` the opponent '' . ) A team gets two points for a win . So , let 's say that a team has a record of 38 wins , 36 losses , and 10 ties . Another team has a record of 40 wins , 38 losses and 6 ties . The first team has ( 38*2 ) +10 = 86 points . The second team has ( 40*2 ) +6 = 86 points . WOW ! They *both* have the same number of points , but the number of wins is different ! How did they do that ? ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! That 's amazing . So , Rex , when people talk about wins being the first tiebreaker , well , then that 's what it means . In our example , the second team would win the tiebreaker and therefore have the `` better '' record , even though both teams had the same number of points . If you did n't understand this post , Rex , maybe you should go back and read it again , very slowly . : - ) : - ) : - ) : - ) : - ) : - ) -- Keith Keller LET 'S GO RANGERS ! ! ! ! !

Actually , it seems that this is more of a GCC question , because I got it to compile without trouble using cc on an RS/6000 . Basically , there are a number of functions with prototypes set up in , let 's say , CompositeP.h , for instance , the composite widget 's insert_child procedure is set up with the type : typedef void ( *XtWidgetProc ) ( Widget ) but in several places in the HP source code , they reference the insert_child procedure and pass it multiple arguments instead of just one , as the prototype suggests . For example : ( *superclass- > composite_class.insert_child ) ( w , args , p_num_args ) Now , GCC chokes on this , giving an error message that too many arguments are passed to the function . So , does anyone have any suggestions as to how to turn off this checking in GCC , or how I can go about changing the code to accomodate this call without changing /usr/include/X11/CompositeP.h , or has anyone successfully built the HP widget set and have any suggestions .

You also have to take into consideration > whether the commands are good or bad . You ask where we are . I would echo that question . I 'm not trying to be contentious . But assuming that the Pope has universal jurisdiction and authority , what authority do you rely upon for your decisions ? What prevents me from choosing ANY doctrine I like and saying that Papal disagreement is an error that will be resolved in time ? This is especially true , since Councils of Bishops have basically stood by the Pope . It appears that much of what lies at the heart of this matter is disagreements over what is tradition and Tradition , and also over authority and discipline . My question to the supporters of SSPX is this : Is there ANY way that your positions with respect to church reforms could change and be conformed to those of the Pope ? ( assuming that the Pope 's position does not change and that the leaders of SSPX do n't jointly make such choice . ) If not , this appears to be claiming infallible teaching authority . If I adopt the view that `` I 'm NOT wrong , I CA N'T be wrong , and there 's NO WAY I 'll change my mind , YOU must change yours '' , that I 've either left the Catholic Church or it has left me . The Orthodox Church does not recognize papal authority/jurisdiction viewing authority as present in each bishop , and in Ecumenical Councils . We regard the subsequent development of the doctrines regarding papal authority and jurisdiction to be a separation of the Bishop of Rome from the Orthodox church . Without going into the merits of the Great Schism , at least the Orthodox agree that a split occurred , and do n't paly what appear to be semantic games like `` He 's the Pope , but we do n't recognize that what he does is effective ... '' . Words aside , it appears to be a de facto split . > So where are we ? Are we in another Arian heresy , complete with weak > Popes ? Or are the SSPX priests modern Martin Luthers ? Well , the only > way to answer that is to examine who is saying what , and what the > traditional teaching of the Church is . We sould argue from now until the Second Coming about what the `` real '' traditional teaching of the Church is . If this were a simple matter East and West would not have been separated for over 900 years . > Many Catholics will decide to side with the Pope . There is some > soundness in this , because the Papacy is infallible , so eventually > some Pope *will* straighten all this out . I thought that the teaching magisterieum of the church did not allow error in teachings regarding faith and morals even in the short term. ` I may be wrong here , I 'm not Roman Catholic . : - ) What would be the effect of a Pope making an ex cathedra statement regarding the SSPX situation ? Would it be honored ? If not , how do you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility ? Again , I 'm not trying to be contentions , I 'm trying to understand . Since I 'm Orthodox , I 've got no real vested interest in the outcome , one way or the other . > Schism is a superset of disobedience ( refusal to obey a legitimate > command ) . All schismatics are disobedient . But it 's a superset , so > it does n't work the other way around : not all disobeyers are > schismatics . The mere fact that the SSPX priests do n't comply with > the Holy Father 's desires does n't make them schismatics . It does if the command was legitimate .

From : parkin @ Eng.Sun.COM ( Michael Parkin ) Subject : Re : DID HE REALLY RISE ? ? ? Reply-To : parkin @ Eng.Sun.COM Organization : Sun Microsystems Inc. , Mountain View , CA Lines : 57 Another issue of importance . Was the crucification the will of God or a tragic mistake . I believe it was a tragic mistake . God 's will can never be accomplished through the disbelief of man . Jesus came to this world to build the kingdom of heaven on the earth . He desperately wanted the Jewish people to accept him as the Messiah . If the crucification was the will of God how could Jesus pray that this cup pass from him . Was this out of weakness . NEVER . Many men and women have given their lives for their country or other noble causes . Is Jesus less than these . No he is not . He knew the crucification was NOT the will of GOD . God 's will was that the Jewish people accept Jesus as the Messiah and that the kingdom of Heaven be established on the earth with Jesus as it 's head . ( Just like the Jewish people expected ) . If this had happened 2000 years ago can you imagine what kind of world we would live in today . It would be a very different world . And that is eactly what GOD wanted . Men and women of that age could have been saved by following the living Messiah while he was on the earth . Jesus could have established a sinless lineage that would have continued his reign after his ascension to the spiritual world to live with GOD . Now the kingdom of heaven on the earth will have to wait for Christ 's return . But when he returns will he be recognized and will he find faith on this earth . Is n't it about time for his return . It 's been almost 2000 years .

And the two simplest refutations are these : ( 1 ) What impact ? The only record of impact comes from the New Testament . I have no guarantee that its books are in the least accurate , and that the recorded `` impact '' actually happened . I find it interesting that no other contemporary source records an eclipse , an earthquake , a temple curtain being torn , etc . The earliest written claim we have of Jesus ' resurrection is from the Pauline epistles , none of which were written sooner than 20 years after the supposed event . ( 2 ) It seems probable that no one displayed the body of Jesus because no one knew where it was . I personally believe that the most likely explanation was that the body was stolen ( by disciples , or by graverobbers ) . Do n't bother with the point about the guards ... it only appears in one gospel , and seems like exactly the sort of thing early Christians might make up in order to counter the grave-robbing charge . The New Testament does record that Jews believed the body had been stolen . If there were really guards , they could not have effectively made this claim , as they did . -Scott O .

The problem is , your use of the word `` objective '' along with `` values . '' Both definitions three and four are inherently subjective , that is they are particular to a given individual , or personal . You see , what one person may see as worthwhile , another may see as worthless . > If on the other hand , some things *have* objective worth , usefulness , > or importance , it would be interesting to know what they are .

Alternatively , you could try to > demonstrate to me that science is not necessarily useful , worthy > or important in any situation . In other words , I need to know > how you use the term `` objective '' . When I find that my usage of a word is different than the usage of that word given by another person , I try to find a standard against which to judge that usage . In most cases , the dictionary is the standard I use . Here is a definiton of objective : objective ADJ . 1 . Of or having to do with a material object as distinguished from a mental concept . 2 . Having actual existance . 3.a . Unenfluenced by emotion or personal prejudice . b . Based on observable phenomenon . By this definition , science does not have an objective worth , since the phrase `` objective worth '' is an oxymoron . However you asked something a little differently this time , you asked for an objective basis for a notion . The fact that the use of science as an intellectual tool is responsible for changes in our world ( the changes are material , and thus `` objective '' ) would provide an objective _basis_ for an argument . However , the conclusion arrived at from that argument ( that science is '' good '' ) is subjective . I think that the problem here is one of word usage . Take a little time and read the definitions of these words : objective , subjective , worth , value , morality , good , evil . I believe that if you think about the meaning of them for a while , you will have to conclude that there is no such thing as an objective morality . > Frank O'Dwyer ' I 'm not hatching That' > odwyer @ sse.ie from `` Hens '' , by Evelyn Conlon eric

Apple ca n't deliver that right now because the 040 saps too much power , radiates far too much heat , and is too large for a notebook . How does one get around that without designing a new chipset ? Use existing PowerBook technology to your best advantage . The Duo Dock gives Apple a unique ability to give users that 040 power in a `` Semi-Portable '' fashion . By plunking the 040 into the Dock , you 've got `` quadra '' power at your desk . On the road , that 33mhz 68030 should be able to handle most of your needs . Okay , not the BEST solution , but its an answer to a no-win situation . : - ) So , does this mean one will be able to use the PowerBook 's processor in parallel to the dock 's processor ? Okay , we 're getting REALLY hypothetical now ... -- Travis Grundke | MacGames Digest- Your # 1 Source for Information , Contributing Editor , | News & Reviews of Gaming Software and the Gaming MacGames Digest | Industry in the Macintosh Community .

I have only one report , which seems to indicate > that a 32K cache card gives you only about a 1 % speedup ! ! Ok . I have a record that shows a IIsi with and without a 64KB cache . It 's small enough that I will attach it . I have also measured some real programs with and without the 64 KB cache . The speedup varies a lot from app to app , ranging from 0 % to 40 % . I think an average of 20 % -25 % is about right . The subjective difference is not great , but is sometimes noticable . A simple cache card certainly does not transform a IIsi into something enormously better . I do not have an FPU . The conventional wisdom says that cache cards from all of the makers offer about the same speedup and that there is not much difference between 32K and 64K caches . I bought mine from Third Wave for well under $ 150 . I have had absolutely no problems at all with it . If you get *complete* speedometer runs for a 32K cache , I 'd like to see them . Let 's check the conventional wisdom ! The so called '' Performance Rating '' numbers by themselves are of no interest . Cheers .

Funny you should mention it ... this is exactly the case I was going to make . > But I think the reason is Lemieux > had a 168 point season and was the first non-Gretzky to win the Hart and > Ross since 1980 . People turned out to watch him play . I will grant that a star like Mario will draw fans , even if the team sucks . But this is short term only ; I still do not think the attendance increase will last , unless the team is a winning/competitive/improving/butt-kicking one . Pittsburgh was still getting better , so people continued to support them . If they suddenly dropped to , say , 50 points , you 'd have knee surgery for some of the people jumping off the bandwagon . > Also , the following year ( 88-89 ) the Pens had 89 points not 87 . Ok. My numbers came from the NHL Guide and Record Book . > They made the transaction to try and build a winner around Mario , that is > true .

An > increase from 38 points to 53 points is not going to do that . The arrival > of Mario Lemieux is what did it . You can give the credit to Mario since he deserves it . But my point is that it was n't Mario himself , but it was the *expectation* of things to come ( i.e . a winning team ) that he created by being the next great hockey superstar . And before anybody jumps in and says I 'm nit-picking and mincing words , go back and read from where this thread started ... It might help to think about what would go through a fan 's mind who suddenly found an interest in Mario and the Pens . Was it `` gee , Mario Lemieux is amazing , I 'll go watch him play '' , or was it `` gee , now we 've got a *kick* *ass* guy on *our* side , I 'll go watch him play '' . I think it was the latter . > Similar thing happened in L.A. Before > Gretzky 's arrival , about 12000 per game . After , constant sellouts . They > are STILL selling out every game despite showing little or no improvement > since Gretzky 's first year there . How do you explain it ? People are going > to see Gretzky . they certainly are n't going to see a winner , they haven't > GOT a winner . They 've had MUCH better teams in their past history than > they currently have , yet they did n't draw as well then . I do n't think this is accurate . The *tickets* sell , but people do n't go to the games . I think this thread has already been discussed ... season ticket holders in LA do n't always use their tickets . So in effect , after the Kings initial success following Gretzky 's arrival ( 68 to 91 points , same source ) and corresponding attendance jump , there has been an effective drop in attendance even though ticket sales may not have changed much . Whether or not the Kings are a 'winner ' is debatable . I claim that since Gretzky 's arrival they have at the very least been competitive ... I also claim that McNall has made a stupid move in trying to reassemble the Oiler dynasty ... but that 's another story and included only because I do n't like McNall : - ) . Anyway , McNall did do some heavy marketing around Gretzky , and that undoubtedly was also responsible for the attendance and merchandising sales , etc . But as I said , when the Kings have been in there little tailspins over the past couple of years there have been empty seats at the Forum even if the tickets were sold . > I think in the case of a Lemieux or Gretzky , the player can transcend > winning as the major drawing power . For the short term , IMO . Although I think that it 's inevitable that the team will improve with a player such as Lemieux or Gretzky , simply because they make people around them better . > But winning sure as hell helps . ; - ) Well , at least we are in full agreement here ! > This does not make Roger 's point any more valid , but the Jets aren't So are you saying Roger has ever had a valid point ? < could n't resist ... > > getting a HUGE jump in productivity , yet they ARE getting a huge > jump in attendance . This is due to the emergence of Teemu Selanne . > They have the 17th best record in hockey , it sure as hell is n't because > they are winning . Yes , but they are doing no worse than last year . I think the same type of reasoning I applied to a new Pittsburgh fan applies to all the extra people showing up at Winnipeg games . It 's difficult to predict , but do you think that if the Jets miss the playoffs next season that in the year after they will maintain their attendance levels ? I seriously doubt it , because in that case the expectation of an improving team would be gone , with or without Selanne . I did provide the example of Rocket Ismail and the Toronto Argonauts of the CFL ... did you leave it out because you do n't know much about the CFL ? If that 's the case then fair enough , but if it is n't the case then I 'm curious to hear your explanation .

Reply-To : st902415 @ pip.cc.brandeis.edu Organization : Brandeis University Lines : 13 Just curious if anyone has started to standout early in the season in the BB DDD this year . I expect the Phillies staff , while getting the wins , would have to rank up there . Luis Gonzalez and Derrick May are among the early league leaders , and all 6 of their bombs have come at the Phils ' expense . Neither of them have exactly been know for their tater prowess in the past . How have the Rockies been early ? I know Mile High has produced a ton of runs , but is it the launching pad everyone expected yet ?

Lines : 34 NNTP-Posting-Host : vela.acs.oakland.edu I was recently loaned an older Dec 210 286 at work , and I have the option of adding an additional Western Digital Hard-drive to the machine . The existing drive is currently a Western Digital as well , and is working fine , but I do not have any documentation available for configuring the master/slave relationship necessary for a c : d : drive setup . The first drive is currently formatted to Tandy Dos v3.3 but I am eventually going to upgrade both to MS Dos v 5.0 The drives themselves are both model number WD95044-A circa 5-07-1991 They are 782 cyl 4 head drives . A note to add is that there is no exact configuration for these in my current bios , but it seems to work at a setting 17 ( 977 cyl 5 head , 300 write_pre , 977 landing zone ) . There are three pairs of jumper pins on the back that I presume are for setting up the master/slave . Originally , the drive in the machine had none . Currently , I was suggested to try the far right ( looking at the back ) for master and the middle jumper for the slave . When booted , the reinitialize seems to puke accessing the d : drive . It does flicker about three times on the second drive , but then gives the error . Hopefully the problem is as simple as the drive not being formatted , but not being a person who has ever had to actual format and unformatted drive , I would not even know how to do that . Any and all help on this is great fully appreciated . If not , a number for Western Digital might just do as good ! swood -- Hunting over in Michigan ?

Why is it that we have this notion that God takes some sort of pleasure from punishing people ? The purpose of hell is to destroy the devil and his angels . To the earlier poster who tried to support the eternal hell theory with the fact that the fallen angels were not destroyed , remember the Bible teaches that God has reserved them until the day of judgement . Their judgement is soon to come . Let me suggest this . Maybe those who believe in the eternal hell theory should provide all the biblical evidence they can find for it . Stay away from human theories , and only take into account references in the bible . Darius

Sessions regarding the Branch Davidian incident in Waco , Texas : `` I had hoped to be making a very different statement this evening . After very careful planning and extensive preparation we all thought that today 's efforts by the FBI to bring the Branch Davidians out of their compound would result in the peaceful resolution of the stand-off or at least meaningful negotiation . `` Instead , we are faced with devastation and death . However , I have no question that our plan was correct and was conducted with extreme professionalism and care . I applaud the restraint shown by agents in the face of life-threatening gunfire , and I thank them for risking their lives to try to end this peacefully .

First off , I have n't used W4WG ( but I think that 's about to change ! ) . The problem is the LASTDRIVE command and the way NetWare in general ( and in this case NETX in particular ) adds drives to the device chain . Setting LASTDRIVE=Z means there are no `` unassigned '' ( as opposed to '' unused '' ) drive letters for NetWare to use , as it tacks its drive mappings -onto the end- of the existing list of drives . W4WG obviously attaches its network drives to `` existing , unused '' drive letters . I 'd guess the next thing I 'd try is something like LASTDRIVE=M , which on most machines will leave a fair swathe of drives for W4WG and still allow up to 13 NetWare drive mappings as well . +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ Nick FitzGerald , PC Applications Consultant , CSC , Uni of Canterbury , N.Z . n.fitzgerald @ csc.canterbury.ac.nz TEL : +64 ( 3 ) 364 2337 , FAX : +64 ( 3 ) 364 2332

The first one is Ray ( or half line ) method . In this method , you can draw any ray , if the number of the intersection point of the ray and the polygon is even , then it is outside . If the number is odd , then it is inside . Of cause , you have to deal with the special cases which may make you headache . The second method is PI algorithm . Draw the lines between the point and all the vertices on the polygon . Calculate and sum the angles of the successive lines . If the result is 2*PI , then it is inside . If PI , then it is on the polygon . Otherwise it is outside . My experience tells the second method is relible . Hope this helps . Yeh USC

The alternative approach ( to CISC ) , which has been adopted by many in recent years , has come to be known as `` RISC '' : the Reduced Instruction Set Computer . This can be characterised simply as `` Simpler is Faster '' ; by simplifying the design ( e.g . by reducing the variety of instructions & addressing modes ) , the hardware can be designed to run faster . Even at the cost of needing more instructions , the same task can be done more quickly by the simpler , faster design . A typical RISC processor will : o provide a large number of registers ( e.g . 32 ) ; o perform all data operations on registers ; o provide few addressing modes ( e.g . immediate or 'register + offset ' ) ; o only allow load & store operations to access memory ; o only use a few instruction formats ; o only support a few data types ( e.g . integer , unsigned , floating ) .

( If they *understood* > some Wittgenstein , 98 % would disappear . : - ) ) '' -- Michael L Siemon > Notice what I said about this book . I called it `` Easy reading . '' The reason I dropped philosphy as my major was because I ran into too many pharisaical Simon 's . I do n't know how many walking encyclopedia 's I ran across in philosphy classes . The problem is n't in knowing sooooo much more than your average lay person , the problem comes when you become puffed up about it . Schaeffer is just fine for the average lay person . That was who he was writting to . I suppose that you would have criticised John that his gospel was to simple . I 've talked with Schaeffer one on one . I 've been in lectures with the man when he was being drilled by philosphy students and prof 's from secular as well as Christian universities . ( ND alone would fill both those catagories ) His answers were enough that the prof 's themselves often were taken back and caused to re-think what their question was . I saw this time and time again at different open forums . So yes , Schaeffers books are by in large , well , simplistic . It certainly is n't grad level reading . But we must get off our high horses when it comes to recommended reading . Do you seriously think most people would get through the first chapter of Wittgenstein ? I may have more to say about this secular scientist at another time . Also , one must finally get beyond the doubt caused by *insistent* inquisitiveness . One can not live his life constantly from a cartisian doubt base . Look , the Christian wholeheartedly supports genuine rationality . But we must add a qualification to give this balance . Christianity is second to none in keeping reason in its place . We never know the value of a thing until we know its limits . Put unlimited value on something and in the end you will exhaust it of all value ! THis is why Xianity is thoroughly rational but not the least bit rationalistic . It also explains the curious fact that it is rationalism , and not Christian faith , which leads to irrationality . If we forget the limits of a thing , we fly in the face of reality and condem ourselves to learn the simple ironic lesson of life : '' More without limits is less ; less with limits is more . '' Or as I have so often stated it , freedom without form soon becomes form w/o freedom . Let 's put it another way . The rationality of faith is implacably opposed to absurdity but has no quarrel with mystery . Think about that . It can tell the difference between the two if you will let it . Christianity 's contention with rationalism is not that it has too much reason in it , but that it has very little else . When a Christian comes to faith his understanding and his trust go hand in hand , but as he continues in faith his trust may sometimes be called to go on by itself without his understanding . This is where the principle of suspended judgment applies . At such time if the Christian faith is to be itself and let God be God , it must suspend judgment and say , `` Father I do not understand you but I trust you . '' Now do n't read all your objections of me into that statement . I was n't saying I do not understand you at all , but I trust you anyway . '' It means that `` I do not understand You *in this situation* but I do understand *why I trust You* anyway '' Therefore I can trust that you understand even though I do not . The former is a mystery unrelieved by rationality and indistinguishable from absurdity . The latter is a statement of rationality of faith walking hand in hand with the mystery of Faith . So ... . the principle of suspended judgment is not irrational . It is not a leap of faith but a walk of faith . As believers we can not always know why , but we canalways know why we trust God who knows why and this makes all the difference . Now , there is one obvious snag to all this and this is where I have parted company with philosophy- what is eminently reasonable in theory is a rather bit more difficult in practice . In practice the pressure of mystery acts on faith like the insistent `` whying '' of a 3 year old . It is n't just that we would like to know what we do not know but that we feel we *must* know what we can not know . The one produces frustration because curiosity is denied ; the other leads to genuine anguish . More specifically the poorer our understanding is in coming to faith the more necessary it will be to understand everything after coming to faith . If we do not know why we trust God , then we will always need to know exactly what God is doing in order to trust him . Failing to grasp that , we may not be able to trust him , for anything we do not understand may count decisevely against what we are able to trust . If , on the other hand , we do know why we trust God , we will be able to trust him in situations where we do not understand what He is doing . ( Too many Xian leaders teach as if the Christian had a window in the back of his head which allows for understanding at every foot fall ) For what God is doing may be ambiguous , but it will not be inherently contradictory ! It may be mystery to us , but mystery is only inscrutable ; what would be insufferable is absurdity . And that my friend , was the conclusion of Nietzche both in theory and in practice . -- Rex

[ 1 ] Born 1964 Secretary-Typist Azsantekmontazh Trust Sumgait Construction and Installation Administration Secretary of the SMU Komsomol Organization Resident at Building 17/33B , Apartment 15 Microdistrict No . 3 Sumgait [ Azerbaijan ] On the 27th my sister Marina and I went to the movies the seven o'clock show , at the theater that is across from the City Party Committee , about 50 yards away . The SK theater . They were showing an Argentinian film , `` The Abyss . '' Before the film we noticed about 60 to 70 people standing near the podium at the City Party Committee , but they were silent , there 's no conversation whatsoever , and we could n't figure out what was going on . That is , we knew it was about Karabagh , but what it was exactly , what they were talking about , if someone gave a speech or not , we did n't know . We bought our tickets . There were 30 or 40 people in the theater . This was a very small number for that large movie theater . The film started . About 30 minutes later they stopped the film . A crowd burst in . About 60 people . They came up onto the stage . Well mostly they were young people , from 16 to 23 years old . They demanded that an Armenian woman come up onto the stage . They used foul language and said that they were going to show what Azerbaijanis were capable of , what they could do to Armenian girls . I thought that 's what they meant because they had demanded a girl specifically . Marina and I were sitting together . I told her to move over , there were some Russian girls sitting nearby . So that if someone recognized me or if something happened , they would take me , and not Marina . It got quiet , 2 or 3 girls jumped up to run out , but the door was closed -- it's only opened at the end of the show -- and they returned to their seats . Everyone in the theater was looking at one another , Russians , Azerbaijanis , people of various nationalities . But no one reacted at all , no one in the auditorium made a sound . They were silent , looking at one another , and gradually started to leave . Some guy , a really fat one , says , `` OK , we 've scared them enough , let 's leave . '' They leave slowly , pompously . It seemed to me that those people were not themselves . Either they had smoked a bunch of '' anasha '' , or had taken something else , because they all looked beastly , like they were ready to tear anyone apart . Then it was all over , as though nothing had happened at all . The film started up again , it was one of those cheerful films which should have only brought pleasure , made you happy to be alive . We could barely sit to the end . So it had started at seven it was over by nine , and it was dark . . . Marina and I were walking home , Lenin Street , that 's the center of town . Lenin Street was packed , just packed with young people . They were shouting , something about Karabagh and something about Armenians . We were n't especially listening , because the way we were feeling we did n't know if we were going to make it home or not , and just what had happened anyway ? Public transportation was n't running . Incidentally , when we came out of the theater we saw police , policemen standing there . The director of the movie theater was looking at the doors , because when they were leaving they had broken the glass , the doors there are basically all glass . Everything was broken . He stood there grief- stricken , but looking as though nothing really big had happened , like some naughty boys had just broken them quite by accident , with a slingshot . Well , since he looked more or less calm I decided that , nothing all that super serious had happened . We went out very slowly ; we wanted to catch a bus , we live literally one stop away . We did n't want to go on foot , not because it was dark , but because something might happen . We flagged down a cab , but the driver did n't want to take us . We told him we live near the bus station , and he said he 'd take us to the bus station and not a yard farther . I said , well , OK . . . So we got into the cab and managed to get there . Something incredible was happening at the bus station . There was a traffic jam . Public transportation was at a standstill and everyone was shouting `` Ka-ra-bagh , '' they 're not going to give up Karabagh . I go home and tell my family what 's going on , and there's immediate panic in the house . Mamma says , what should we do ? Like the end had come , they were going to come , kill us , that 's it . . . Somehow we managed to cheer ourselves up : Nothing that bad could happen . Where are we living anyway , just what kind of social order do we have ? Somehow we manage to calm Mamma down . And we went to bed . But no one could sleep . Everyone made as though nothing had happened . That was on Saturday . In short , the day went by . We did n't go anywhere and did n't call our relatives . No one did anything . Because . . . life goes on . That day I realized something was approaching , but what exactly , I couldn't guess . On the 28th everything was like it was supposed to be , we lived like we always had . There were five of us at home : Mamma , Papa and us , three sisters : Lyuda , Marina , and I . My sister Lyuda was in Yerevan at the time . We sat at home and no one went out . Later we learned that a demonstration had started that morning . It all started . . . They were smashing up stores . We were sitting at home and did n't know anything about it . Then a girlfriend of mine , Lyuda Zimogliad , came by at around three o'clock I think . We worked together , we did our apprenticeships together , she 's a Russian girl . She said that something awful was happening in town . I asked , `` Do n't they want Armenians ? Well what are they after , if they 're already in that state ? '' She says , no , nothing like that , it 's just a demonstration , but it 's awful to watch it . Somehow , it feels like a war has broken out . Public transportation has been stopped . . . The cabs , the buses , well it 's just a nightmare . Then Papa decides to go to the drugstore , my mother was having allergy problems at the time . . . He left the house and our neighbor , Aunt Vera , asked him , `` Where are you going ? Stop ! There are such terrible things going on in the courtyard ; are n't you afraid to go out ? '' Papa did n't know what she was talking about . She simply pushed him back into the entryway . He came home and told Mamma . Mamma said , `` Well , if Aunt Vera was talking like that it means that something is really going on . '' But we did n't go see her , she 's a Russian , she lives across from us . I had to see my friend out . Around five o'clock I tell Lyuda , `` Ok , look , it 's time for you to go , it 's late already , I 'll see you out . '' Mamma says , `` You do n't need to go , it 's too late already , you can see what the situation in town is . '' So we decided to stay home . Dinner was ready . Mamma says , `` Let her eat with us , then she can go . '' We sat down at the table . But no one was hungry , no one was in the mood , we just put everything out on the table to calm ourselves down , and make it appear that we 're eating . We turned on the television , and the show `` In Fairy-Tale Land '' was coming on . We cleared the table . We hear some noise out in the courtyard . I go out on the balcony , but I ca n't see what 's going on , because the noise is coming from the direction of the bus station , and there is a 9-story building in the way . There is mob of people . . . I ca n't figure out what 's happening . They 're shouting something , looking somewhere , I ca n't make out what is going on . I go down to a neighbor , she 's an Azerbaijani ; we 've been friends of her family for about 25 years . I go down to look from their place . I see people shouting , looking at the 5-and 9-story buildings near the bus station . Just then soldiers set upon them , about 20 people , with clubs . The mob runs off in different directions . I even see several people from our building . They are looking and laughing . . . I decide that means it 's not all that bad if they are laughing : it means they 're not killing anyone . But now the crowd suddenly dashes toward the soldiers . One of the soldiers can not manage to get away , they start stomping on him with their feet , everyone 's kicking him . . . I become ill and go home , and explain in general terms that horrible things are going on out there . . . ca n't speak . . . Well , they 've probably killed that soldier , the way that crowd is . . . If each of them kicked him just once . . . They took his club away from him and started to beat him with it . But it was far away and I could n't see if he got up and left or not . I become terrified and go home and say , `` Lyuda , do n't go anywhere , stay at our place , because if you go out they could kill you or . . . `` Then the crowd runs over closer toward our building and stands at the 12-story building and starts shouting something . We go out onto the balcony . All of our neighbors are also out on theirs , too . Everyone is standing , staring . The mob is shouting and about 5 minutes later comes running toward our building . As it turns out , at the 12-story building the Azerbaijani neighbors went down and kept them from coming in . There 's only one entryway there , they could stop them . They all run up to our building . Mamma immediately starts closing the windows , afraid that they might throw stones . They have stones and they break the windows , all of them . There are very many people . We have a large courtyard , and it 's packed with people . They spill up to the first floor so they do n't crush each other . They crawl up on trees , posts , and garages . It 's just a huge cloud of people . They break and burn the motorcycle of the Armenian Sergey Sargisian , from our building . We close the windows and immediately hear tramping in our entryway . They come up to our fifth floor with a tremendous din and roar . It 's incomprehensible . Mamma told me later that they were shouting Father 's name , `` Grisha , open the door , we 've come to kill you ! , '' or something like that . I do n't remember that , I was spaced out , kind of . Mamma says , `` Into the bedroom , quickly ! '' In the bedroom we have two tall beds , part of our dowry ; Mamma says , `` Hide there , they probably wo n't come in there , they 'll ask something , say something , and leave . '' She says , `` We 'll tell them that we live alone here . '' I ca n't imagine that my parents will stand out in the hall alone talking with some sort of beasts . . . I go to them and say that I 'll stand together with them , I 'll talk with them if they come , maybe I can find a common language with them , all the more so if they know me : I speak Azerbaijani more or less , and I can find out what they want . I told Marina and Lyuda to hide under the bed , and my sister Lyuda , I ca n't remember if I told her anything or not . Then . . . they open the door : it 's like they blew on it and it broke and fell right into the hall . The crows bursts in and starts to shout : Get out of here , leave , vacate the apartment and go back to your Armenia ; things like that . I tell them , `` What has happened , speak calmly . One of you , tell me , calmly , what has happened . '' In Azerbaijani , they say , `` Get out of the apartment , leave . '' I say , `` OK. Go downstairs . We 'll gather everything we need and leave the apartment . '' I realize that it is senseless to discuss any sort of rights with them , these are animals . They must be stopped . The ones standing in the doorway , the young guys , say , `` There are old people and one girl with them . Too bad ! '' They take two or three steps back . It seems as though I have pacified them with our exchange . Then someone in the courtyard shouts , commanding them : `` Do n't you understand what you are saying ? Kill them ? '' And that was it ! That was all it took . They grab Papa , carry him into one room , and Mamma and me into another . They put Mamma on the bed and start undressing her , beating her legs . They start tearing my clothes , right there , in front of Mamma . I do n't remember where they went , what they did , or how much time passed . I had the feeling that they beat me on the head , on my body , and tore my clothes , all at the same time , I do n't even know what I said . The atrocities started . I was savagely raped in that room . They argued among themselves who would go first . Later , I remember , I came to . I do n't know if I 'm dead or alive . Someone comes in , someone tall , I think , clean-shaven , in an Eskimo dogskin coat , balding . He looks around at what 's happening . At that instant everything stops . It seems to me that he is either their commander or . . . that somehow everything depends on him . He looks and says , `` Well , we 're done here . '' They are beating Mamma on the head . They break up the chairs and beat her with the chair legs . . . She loses consciousness , and they decide that she 's dead . Papa . . . was out cold . They want to throw Lyuda off the balcony , but they ca n't get the window open . Apparently the window frames are stuck after the rain and the windows ca n't be opened . They leave her next to the window . She was thinking about being thrown out the window and passed out . She 's not a real strong person anyway . . . He looks at me and sees that I 'm saying something , that I 'm still twitching . Well , I start saying the opposite of what I should be , which is humbling myself and pleading . I start shouting , cursing . . . they do n't get any entreaty out of me . I already know that I 'm dead , why would I humble myself before anyone ? And he says that if that 's what I think , since my tongue is so long . . . maybe he thinks that I still look quite appealing . . . In short , he commands that I be taken outside . I no longer saw or remembered what was happening to Marina and Lyuda , I do n't know if they are alive or not . They take me outside . They are dragging me by my arms , by my legs . They are hitting me against the wall , the railings , something metal . . . While they are carrying me someone is biting me , someone else is pinching me . . .I do n't even know . I think , my God , when will death come ? If only it were sooner . . . Then . . . they carry me out , throw me near the entryway . . . and start kicking me . I lose consciousness . . . What happened after that , how many people there were , I do n't remember . I come to after a while , I do n't remember how long . A neighbor is bringing me clothing . I 'm entirely covered with blood , she puts a dress on me . I remember that I said the same words over and over again : `` Mamma , what happened , Mamma , what have they done to us , where are we , whose house are we at ? '' I ca n't make sense out of anything . There is a guy standing over me , I sort of know him , he served in Afghanistan , his name is Igor , he brought me indoors . When they all went to the third entryway and killed a person there , Igor gathered his courage , took me into his arms , and brought me to the neighbors ' , even though he 's small-minded , he put himself at risk . Igor Agayev is Azerbaijani ; he served in Afghanistan . There are three brothers . The older brother also served there , I think ; now he 's stationed here , on the border , in Armenia . Igor brought me to the neighbors ' , and then helped me come to my senses , saying , '' Karina , I know you , calm down , I 'm not one of them . '' How do I know who 's who and what 's what ? I come to , and they clean me up . I was covered in blood . Then Papa . . . I saw Papa , I saw Mamma . And Marina , too . . . Igor was there when they dragged Marina and Lyuda out from under the bed . . . Marina . . . Lyuda said that she was Russian , they said , we 'll let you go , we are n't touching the Russians , go . And while they are dragging Marina out she decides she 's going to tell them she 's Azerbaijani . Igor immediately grabs Marina 's and Lyuda 's hands , because he knows Marina , and knows that she is Armenian and is our sister , and takes her to the second floor to a neighbor 's and starts pounding on the door so she will open up . She opens the door and Igor pushes them in there . So they survived . My sister Lyuda lost consciousness after the bandits started stealing things . While they were going downstairs , taking things downstairs , then coming back up again , Lyuda seized the opportunity and crawled under the bed and stayed there . Then , when she was herself again , she found a torn night shirt and put it on , and some sort of robe and went to a neighbor 's on the fourth floor , the one whose apartment I had watched the crowd from , the friend of ours , and knocked on the door . The neighbor opened and said , `` I 'm not going to let you in the apartment because I 'm afraid of them . But I 'll give you some stockings and we 'll leave the building . '' Lyuda says , `` I 'll stay at your place because of what 's going on , they keep going up and down the stairs . '' It was just for a moment , just a moment in life , but the neighbor would n't consent . Lyuda came back to our place and lay under the bed . . . I came to . Mother was there . I ca n't remember my supervisor 's telephone number , but something had to be done . Somehow I remembered and called , and he came to get us . He did n't have any idea what was going on . He thought we were simply afraid , he did n't know that they were killing us and that we had passed between life and death . He came and got us and took us to the police precinct . There they looked us over . I was having trouble walking , my lungs hurt badly , it was hard to breathe . . . My supervisor 's name is Urshan Feyruzovich Mamedov . He 's the head of our administration . They took us there . When we were leaving , I saw a great number of buses full of soldiers at the entrance to town . The buses were ordinary passenger buses . There were very many soldiers . We left around eleven , right after eleven . If these people could stop what was happening they could save a great many lives . . . Because the crowd was moving on , toward the school , and what was going on there . . . I think everyone know not only in Sumgait , not only in Yerevan . Because there they murdered them all one after the next , without stopping . After us . I think 14 people died in Microdistrict No . 3 , and 10 to 12 of them were from Buildings 4 , 5 , and 6 . In our building one person died , and one old woman died from Building 16 , that 's the building in front of ours . There young Azerbaijani men stopped the mob and would n't let it into their building . Incidentally , when we were at the neighbors ' , Marina called our relatives to warn them , so they would all know what was happening . I called a aunt in Microdistrict No . 5 . They have three neighbors who are Armenians . I said , `` Run quickly , I ca n't explain what 's going on ; hide , do what you can , just stay alive . Hide at Azerbaijanis ' , ones who wo n't give you away . '' At that moment three people came in , policemen . I think they were Azerbaijanis . I was in such awful condition , my face was completely distorted my lips were puffed up , there was blood , my eye was swollen , no one thought I would ever see anything out of that eye again . . . my forehead was badly cut , and one-half of my face was pushed out forward . No one would have thought that I would survive , get my normal appearance back , and be able to grasp anything at all . I started to scream at those people , why did you come , who sent you here , no one wants you here , have n't you killed people people yet , what are you doing here ? One of the soldiers said , `` Do n't scream at us . We 're Muslims , but we 're not from the Sumgait police . They called in from Daghestan . '' So at that point the Daghestan police were there . When we got to the police precinct there were an awful lot of police there , there were soldiers , police with dogs , ambulances , firemen . . . I do n't know , maybe they were waiting for people to bring them the goners and the seriously injured to treat them there in the police precinct . I do n't know what they were there for . There were also doctors from Baku there . They examined Lyuda and me and said , `` These women need to go to the Maternity Home , but we do n't know what to do with the rest . '' So they took us , and I lost contact with my parents , my boss , everyone . My boss said , `` Do n't worry , I 'll find you , no matter where you are , no matter what happens . '' We went to the hospital . There we were examined by a department head from the Sumgait Maternity Home , Pashayeva , I think her name was . She examined us . The ambulance was from Baku ; I figured out that the Sumgait ambulances had n't done anything , they did n't respond to any calls . People called and neither the police nor the ambulances showed any sign of life . That doctor looked me over and I could tell from her behavior that something very good had happened , for she became quite glad . I even thought to myself , '' God , can it be that nothing all that bad is wrong ? '' She looks me over and says , `` Now why are you suffering so ? You do n't know what your people have been doing , your people did even worse things . '' And I think , great , I have to deal with her . . . And I felt so bad , I thought , why do n't I just die so as not to have to hear more stuff like this from people like her ? Here I am in this condition and being told about something that our people did . I just did n't have the energy to say , `` How could our people possibly be smart enough to think of something that yours have n't already done ? '' I stayed there . Then they brought in another woman , Ira B. , she was married , and she was raped in her own apartment , too . There were three of us , Ira , Lyuda , and 1 . The next morning they took Lyuda and Ira away . They did n't do anything to help us . This was in the old Maternity Home , in the combined block . They did n't do anything more than examine me , that was it . I did n't want any shots or tranquilizer , nothing . What shots could have calmed me down ? I did n't even want to look at them . I lay in the ward . Either it just worked out that way or they did it on pur- pose , but I was alone . I was alone even though the wards were packed . That same evening a woman came by and asked me what was wrong with me , that my face was disfigured . She asked what had happened to me , and I said , `` Better to ask your brother what happened , there 's no point in asking me , your brother can better explain what happened . '' She fell into a faint . All the doctors threw themselves at her , and the doctor categorically forbade anyone to come into my ward . Then people from work came to see me , my boss , his daughter ; they brought me clothing , because I was literally naked . The only thing I had on was a dress , but the woman who gave it to me was very short , and the dress was way up above my knees , and the woman orderly said , `` I ca n't believe you put on such a short dress , who are you showing off your legs to here ? '' I went back to my ward thinking , just one more thing from something . People from work came and brought me something in a sack , apples , I think , three or four pounds , but I could n't take them . I had become so weak that it was just embarrassing . I said that I could n't take the apples , and really did n't have any appetite . No one had to bring me anything . Some woman took the sack . . . And , oh yes ! . . . Then I heard that the head doctor tell a nurse that my medical history should be hidden or torn up completely so that no one would know that I was an Armenian , maybe they would n't figure it out from looking at me . So they must have been thinking that there would be some kind of attack , that something else would happen . That it would be worse . Or , perhaps , someone was outside on the street , I do n't know . In any case , I did n't sleep a wink that night . The next morning they picked me up , a whole police detail , put me in a bus , and off we went . I did n't even know where they were taking me . They took me to the club where the troops were , the very one I was in that ill-fated evening . I got off the bus . Near the City Party Committee there were a great many troops , tanks , armored personnel carriers ; the whole scene was terrible . I saw a few people I knew there , and that calmed me a little . I had already thought that I was the only one left . So there were five or six of us left in Sumgait after that night . I still did n't know what happened to my parents , they did n't come to see me in the hospital , and my boss told me that everything was fine . I did n't know whether to believe him or not . Maybe he was just trying to calm me down , maybe something happened on the way . Then I went to the club and saw a lot of people I knew . They all knew one another , they were all kissing each other and asking , `` What happened , what went on ? '' Two days later they came to see me from work . They were there all the time . Each day they came , showed interest , and were constantly bringing me money . They did everything they could . Of course I 'm most thankful to my boss , the only one of my colleagues who did n't lose his presence of mind and who did n't change his opinions , neither before , nor after , nor in the heat of the moment , no matter what happened . He constantly took an interest . A sincere interest , from the heart . . . Then , about two days later , the secretary of the Party Committee came , not from our Party organization , but from the First Trust , which ours is part of , Comrade Kerimov , a very important figure in our town . He made arrangements with the emergency medical personnel to take me away , because if I sat down by myself I could n't get up or lie down again . There was something wrong with my lungs , it was hard to breathe . They examined me there several times , there I lay were several doctors , they all thought that . . . that it must just be from all the blows , I do n't know . They did n't diagnose anything in particular . When I was in the Maternity Home I even asked . . . I made it a point of insisting that they take me to the trauma section because I felt so awful . There was no way something inside was n't broken , my ribs . . . Well they took me there and took x-rays and said that everything was fine . There were emergency medical workers on duty in the club . The mother of one of Marina 's friends was there . She was the head doctor at the Sumgait Children 's Clinic . They had every kind of antifever agent in the world , which was exactly what I needed at that moment , I thought . I said that I was having great difficulty breathing , I could n't seem to get enough air , something was wrong with me . They put tight bandages around my chest and waist . Later I overheard some people saying that I had been cut all over . I think they just saw me being all bandaged up and decided that my breasts and face had been cut . . . But I was n't cut . They took us to the Khimik boarding house . We lived there a long time . Soon appeared representatives . . . They were agitating . At first people would not talk to them , and drove them off . One of the Armenian women shouted , `` We demand that Seidov come ! '' The response was , `` It 's Seidov who sent us . '' Seidov is the Chairman of the Azerbaijani Council of Ministers . The woman said , '' We 'll only see Seidov 's daughter , have her come here , we 'll do the same things to her that they did to our daughters , and then we 'll deal with you agitators . '' And so on . More of them said , `` Have Seidov himself come . '' This went on day in , day out . The agitators kept coming and coming , this drove us out of our wits . Then people gradually started departing for Yerevan because they realized it was senseless to stay . Everything got on our nerves : The smell , the small children . There were children at the SK club , children who had literally just come out of the Maternity Home . What were they doing in a club that did n't even have running water all the time ? At first we had to pay to eat there . They even overcharged us , as it turned out . On the second day someone told us that they would bring us food for free . The children were ill. Everything stank there . Well imagine about 3,000 people in a small movie theater with seating for no more than 500 . You could n't sit or lie down , it was impossible to even move . The stench was awful . Even the smallest infants took ill overnight there . I heard that they were arriving seriously ill in Yerevan , the infants . They have to be washed , they have to be bathed , not to mention that we , the adults , were ill and needed care . People were fainting right and left . I just do n't know , everyone was crying , everyone . . . Only the young people , the men , somehow managed to keep it together . But the women were in a constant state of panic . It seemed to everyone that they would come any minute and kill and stab . It seemed clear that we had been gathered together purposely , like during the war , so that they could burn the movie theater and there would n't be a single Armenian left . Then people went up to the attic . I did n't see them , I only heard them , because I was lying down and could n't get up . I lay right on the stage , we had some room there . Apparently they caught two people with either oil or gas . I think they wanted to burn the theater . Maybe someone saw them , I did n't . I was in no condition to open my eyes . Everyone was suspicious of everyone else . They would ask , `` Are n't you an Azerbaijani ? I think I saw you somewhere , I think you 're an Azerbaijani . '' They led out all the men and started letting them back in by checking their passports , relatives might be covering for each other . Half of the people did not have any documents . There were people who had run out of their homes in nothing but a pair of pants and slippers , or wearing just a shirt , not like they should have , with their IDs . So on the 28th , on Sunday , I think , the police did nothing to help us . On Monday everything resumed where it had left off on Block 41A . They did n't spare a soul there : not children , not pregnant women , nobody . They killed , they burned , they hacked with axes , just everything possible . They murdered the Melkumian family whom I knew , my mother worked with them . Their daughter- in-law went to school with my older sister . They were brutally murdered . Only the two daughters-in-law survived . By a miracle one was able to save herself , she ran away , the neighbors would n't take her in , so she ran about the building until she found refuge . She was pregnant and had two small children . This all continued on Monday in Block 41A , on the 29th , when the troops were already in the city . They murdered people , they overturned automobiles , and they burned entire families . They say they did n't even know for sure if the people were Armenians or not . I heard that the Lezgins suffered , too . I 'm not sure myself , I did n't see any Lezgins who had been injured . They burned cars so it 's very difficult now to say exactly who died and who did n't . It was very difficult to identify the corpses , or rather , what remained of the corpses after they were doused in gasoline and burned . . . it 's all very hard to imagine , of course I heard that many people disappeared without a trace , from the BTZ plant two people , including a woman who worked the night shift , Aunt Razmella , who also lived in Microdistrict 3 . They were stopping buses between Baku and Sumgait . In the evening people who had been visiting Baku were returning to Sumgait , and people from Baku were going home from Sumgait , and there were students , too . They were simply savagely murdered . They were stopping the buses , the drivers immediately did what they were told because there was just no other way to deal with that hoard of brutally minded people . They stopped the buses , dragged the Armenians out and killed them on the spot . I did n't see it myself , but I heard that they put them all in a pile so as to burn them . Later it was hard to discern from the corpses , well you ca n't call them corpses , you had to figure out from the ashes who it was . l heard that two fellows saved two women , one a student , Ira G. , if I 'm not mistaken . She was in the hospital a long time after that , and she still ca n't figure out who saved her . She was also brutally raped and beaten and thrown onto a pile of corpses . The fellow pulled her out of that whole pile of corpses , put his coat on her , took her into his arms , and carried her to the city . I still ca n't imagine how he managed to do that . I heard that from Engels Grigorian . He knows her , apparently . Well a lot of people went to that hospital anyway . She was in the hospital and singing a song in Armenian , and they wrote the words down , and , I think he still has that piece of paper , because he says that a lot of people now have that song , the one she sang in the hospital where she lay in such bad shape . They could n't find the guy who saved her . He left her in someone 's apartment and called the ambulance , she was in such awful shape that , probably , like me , she could n't remember anyone 's face . I think that I knew one of the people who broke into our house , maybe I had talked with him once . But I received so many blows everything was just knocked out of my head . I ca n't remember to this day who he was . Then , it seems , I saw the Secretary of the Directorate 's Party organization , where Marina works . She goes to school and works , she goes to night school at AZI , and works by day at the Khimzashchita Construction and Installation Administration . I 'm the Secretary of the Komsomol organization at our administration and often met with the secretaries of Party and Komsomol organizations . We had joint meetings . I know them all , I 've even talked with them , and he , I know , is from Armenia . An Azerbaijani , but from Armenia . It became obvious that many of those people were Azerbaijanis born in Armenia . They took me to various police stations , to the police precinct , and to the Procuracy , because the USSR Procuracy got involved in the case , and I iden- tified the photographs of people who I could more or less recognize . They showed me the people who were in our apartment , they 're working on our case , but I ca n't even recognize them , although it was proved that they were the ones , they 're processing it somehow . They tell me that they know that someone held me by the arm and someone else held me by the leg when they were dragging me . There was someone else in our apartment who did not even touch me , he just stole a blanket and an earring or something like that . All these people , all of them , as much as I 've heard about them and seen them , they were all from Kafan . The Secretary of the Party organization is named Najaf , Najaf Rzayev . He was there when everything started . It must have been him because I did n't recognize anyone else in the crowd whom I knew besides him . All the more since I told him , `` Listen , you do something , because you know me . '' He turned away and went toward the bedroom , where Marina was . Well you could n't see Marina anyway . There was such a noisy confusion of people that you could n't make out anyone . All of it flew right out of my head , and then gradually I became myself again , at the City Party Committee . . . There were military people there . I told them what went on , and they wrote it all down . I told them his name . On March 8 the Secretary of our First Trust Party organization , the one we 're part of , came to see us , his name is Najaf Rzayev . I tell Mamma , `` If he 's here despite the fact that I gave his name , it means that either his alibi has been confirmed or , probably , that they think I 'm crazy , not responsible for my words . '' He said , `` What did they do to you , how awful , myself , I hid an Armenian family . '' Then after some time goes by he comes back again and says something entirely different : `` I was n't at home , my family and I went to Baku . '' I said , `` Marina , what is he saying ? He said something totally different before . '' After that I did n't go to see our Procurator , our case is being handled by a procurator from Voronezh , Fedorov by name . Fedorov told me that Rzayev 's case had just gotten to him , and there were so names involved . What are they doing with Rzayev ? Did he prove his alibi or not ? They just think that since I was hit in the head I ca n't say anything for sure , whether it was him or not . It will be an insult if he was in our apartment and does n't have to pay for it , but at the same time I 'm afraid to say I 'm a hundred percent sure that it was he . Because no mat- ter who I name , they tell me , no , you 're wrong , he did n't do that , that one was n't there . All the faces have gotten mixed up in my mind . Who did what exactly I ca n't say . When they took me outside there was a whole crowd there , but I did n't see it , because I had my eyes closed all the time . It seemed to me that I always got it because of my eyes , people were always hassling me , for some reason it always seemed to me that my eyes are responsible . When they were beating my face I thought they were trying to put my eyes out . So I had my eyes closed , they took me outside and started to beat me . A young guy , 22 , held my arms , he works at the BTZ plant . And right nearby , across the road from us , Block 41 , is where all this was going on . Right across the road from us . The BTZ dormitory is over there , that 's where he lives . Now he 's in custody , they even have proved , as far as I know , that it was he who killed Shurik Gambarian , the clarinet player from the third entryway of our building . One person in our building was killed , it was that man . A guy comes by who shared a room with the guy who was holding me . He saw that he was holding me by the arms and that he was beating me , but he did n't come over , he just looked and then went into the dormitory . A while after it was all over , people started making announcements in town saying that investigators had been summoned . That guy went and told them everything . Now they 've caught him , everything 's been proved . Now , evidently , they 've been beating him , I do n't know what they 're doing with them over there , but he himself said that he was working the night shift at the plant . Some young guy came to the plant and said , `` Everyone who wants to kill Armenians come to the bus station on Saturday at ten . '' That was it . He said , the ones who wanted to , went . This was at the BTZ plant , during the night shift , probably , late Friday night . It was at night , they were at the sauna together . And he said , what do you mean , do you understand what you are saying ? The others were silent , probably , in their hearts they were thinking , I 'm going to go . But they didn't say anything to one another . He said that he thought it important to to go , because he had heard a lot about what had happened in Kafan , that they had killed their Azerbaijani sisters , their mothers , burned villages , and all of that . That guy was also born in Kafan . That is certain . And Marina says that the Secretary of the Party organization is from Armenia , too . from I 've participated in the investigation a couple of times . I 'm satisfied with them thus far . They summoned us and asked about what happened , and every word I said was recorded . I met some guy there . . . By the way , he was an Armenian . I said that he was in our apartment , but what he did , I do n't know . His last name was Grigorian , Eduard Grigorian . He s from Sumgait , from Microdistrict 1 . He was sentenced I think , to five years , not his first time . His mother is Russian . I met with him at the KGB in Baku , at the Azerbaijani KGB . They took us there and showed me photographs . There were so many photographs , I think they even photographed those people who were caught at curfew , and I 've got them all confused . I say , the face was about like this , the guy in the white coat with the red clasps . But he could take that coat off and burn it somewhere , and it would be like looking for a needle in a haystack . Well . This guy , Grigorian , I said , he was in our apartment , but he is so light-complected that he looks like a Lezgin . I do n't know what he did , I ca n't remember . Maybe he beat me or raped me . But he was in our apartment . At the KGB he started asking me , pleading with me , there 's no need for this , all this stuff , look me in the eyes , you 're like a sister to me . I took a look at him and thought , `` My God , Heaven forbid that I should have a brother like you . '' But they were satisfied with my responses , because I said everything without great certainty . I was there with Mamma . Then Lyuda came in , but when she came in she got sick immediately . She wanted to kill him , she crawled over the table at him . She recognized him . When she came to , Lyuda was lying on the balcony , the mob threw her there and all of them ran into the bedroom . We had all kinds of boxes with dishes in them , the dowries for all three sisters . They stole everything in the apartment , leaving only small things . At that moment Lyuda came to and started remembering everything . Well , seeing the faces , hearing the voices . . . Two people were saying they could burn the apartment . Another says , why burn the apartment when I 've got three kids and no place to live . So this guy was in temporary housing , he did n't have anywhere to live , he was from Sumgait . They were sure that they would get the apartment . Besides , the neighbors were Azerbaijani . Why should they burn the apartment , they might burn Azerbaijanis . That 's what they said . How did they know there were Azerbaijanis there , if they just picked a place , thinking that Armenians lived there ? We have a list of the residents for our part of the building , our name is in there , but how could they know that Azerbaijanis lived on the other side of the wall from us ? So they did n't set fire to our apartment . I do n't know , I was in such bad shape that if all of it had come to a halt when I was outside , if someone had asked me what was happening , I would have said that a civil war was going on . Well , maybe not civil . . . but probably civil , because when they were beating me I opened my eyes and saw that all the neighbors were standing on their balconies and watching , like at a free horror film . So a civil war was going on , and only the Armenians were being fought . If it were a world war or something like that , they would have been fighting everyone . But they only fought us . Then I met some women from our building , some Azerbaijanis . They are crying , they tell me , `` Karina , we saw all of it , how could it happen ? '' They 're asking me ! Well I just do n't know what to call it if a normal girl can stand there and watch what happened to me . I think that if it were the other way around either I would n't have been able to take it , or I would have tried to avert it , like that one Azerbaijani woman did in front of our building . A woman lives there , an awful , dissipated woman , if you can call her a woman , the dissipated life she leads . Two Armenian families live there , in her part of the building . She came out on the balcony and saw what was happening to me and started to scream and curse . She came down to the entryway and said , `` You 'll come in this entryway over my dead body . '' So not one of them took it in his head to go in that entryway . Some folks were saying that those people were so out of control that they did n't even know what they were doing . I do n't think that 's true . They knew very well what they were doing if they did n't even lift a hand against that woman . They could n't have cared less about her , but the fact that she was an Azerbaijani stopped them . They were just beasts , they had smoked so much . When they came to our place they were all chewing something . I noticed : Everyone who came into the apartment was chewing something . I think , my God , maybe I just think that ? Maybe I 'm losing my mind ? But no , they 're all chewing something . Maybe it is some kind of drug , it must be , because . . . At first glance they all seemed to be such normal people , young , clean-shaven , looking exactly as if they had come to some sort of celebration . But they were shouting something . They did n't talk , they shouted , as though there were deaf people there . They screamed and screamed : `` Yeah , killing , killing , we 're killing the Armenians ! '' Only they did n't shout `` kill , '' they shouted `` gurun ermianlary . '' Gurun literally means `` kill , '' or `` destroy . '' That 's how it was ! I 'll continue . We hid in a captain 's apartment , he 's an Azerbaijani , his wife is a Tatar . We were sitting in their apartment , their kids were out in the yard . Their kids knew a whole lot . This was in our part of the building , on the third floor . When Mamma came to and could n't find Lyuda she took Papa 's hand , this was while the looters were stealing things , but they did n't pay attention because they were stealing things . Apparently they had already ceased killing and switched to stealing . Mamma found the courage to . . . A boy said to my mother `` Where 's the gold ? '' Mamma said he must have been 12 to 14 years old . He even looked Russian , he was so fair-skinned . But the Azerbaijanis from Armenia are fair-skinned . I noticed they were all on the fair side . He shouted , they were all smashing things , and he asks Mamma where the gold is . We kept our gold in the wardrobe with our important papers . In a little black bag , we kept everything in there . Mamma does n't really like to wear gold . She probably never even wore those things from the time they were bought for her . They took everything that was lying on the cheval glass . Mamma thinks that the gold saved us . Because they threw themselves at the gold , and Mamma grabbed Papa , who was trying to breathe . They had closed his mouth , bound his hands , and put a pillow and a chair on his face . . . They had shoved something into his mouth so he would suffocate . Mamma grabbed him and tore all that stuff off . . . He had something in his mouth , he was having trouble breathing , his nose was filled with blood . Mamma grabbed him and started running from the fifth down to the first floor because no one wanted to open their doors to them . Mamma said that by accident , completely by accident that person opened his door , he was sleeping , and said , half-awake , '' What 's happened ? '' He sees that they are bloody . Mamma said , `` At least go and find out what 's happening to my daughters , even if they 've burned them or murdered them , at least bring the corpses . '' He went looking for us . At that moment Lyuda was under the bed . She says that after they left it seemed that someone was calling her name . When he quietly called her she could n't get out from under the bed . She wanted to get out and was calling softly . She thought she was shouting , but in fact she was either silent or was only talking to herself , it just seemed to her that she was shouting . When she got out from under the bed everyone was gone . And again . . . She thought that she had lost her mind . I 'll never leave here , never ! To hell with it ! It just seems that way to me , I 'll come to eventually . But then , when everything had settled down , stopped , that mall brought Lyuda down , and Igor carried me in from outside . Or first I was brought in , then Lyuda , I do n't remember what order it happened in . And Mamma said , `` Listen , they 're all running around down there , shouting something or other , and running toward the other building . '' It had more or less calmed down where we were . Who 's dead , who 's alive , we do n't know . I tried to call my girlfriend . I had basically come to . Mamma says , `` Listen ; let 's go upstairs , at least get a mattress or something . We do n't know how long we 'll be here . Maybe they did n't burn everything . '' I do n't get it , all women have that feeling , they want to get something from their homes , maybe not everything was taken ? I tell Mamma , `` Mamma , what do you need any of that for ? To hell with it ! We 're alive , forget the rest of it , all of it ! '' She says , `` No , let 's go get at least something . Maybe we 'll leave here , spend the night at someone else 's . '' Mamma went upstairs , and their little boy , their son Alik , was standing on the lookout . lIe was standing there to see if they were coming . They only managed to run up there and grab something one time . He shouts , `` Come back , they 're coming ! '' They did n't have enough time to get a lot , mattresses from one apartment , a blanket from another . . . Mamma got my knitting . . . Someone managed to grab our old things , the ones we never wore , out of the hall . . . Someone took Father 's old coveralls . The neighbor , his wife , Mamma and Papa . . . Marina went with them . I was in no condition to leave . Neither was Lyuda . We just sat . They ran out and we closed the door and just then we hear that the mob is on its way toward our place upstairs , they 're dragging something again . They were going toward the other building , maybe over by the school , or . . . There was an unfinished building over there , people said they were going toward the basement or the unfinished building , they could gradually carry everything over there . Then things more or less calmed down . I tried to call my boss . Later there was more noise . We were on the third floor , in a one-bedroom apartment , and a woman lives in the one-bedroom place on the second floor , Asya Dallakian . She 's an old woman , retired . She was n't at home , at that time she was usually in the country , she has a married daughter there , and her grandson is in the army . She is only very rarely in town ; she gets her retirement money and the apartment is essentially vacant . They started pounding on her door and broke it down . She had two or three beds in there , something like that , she 's a 60-to 70-year-old woman who really does not even live there . Probably she had some pots , a couple of metal bed frames and mattresses , and a television . When her grandson came she bought a television . They started wrecking everything . I started getting sick again . I think , `` My God , what is going on around here ? When will this end ? '' We turned off the lights and sat . As it turns out the people who were n't afraid , the ones who knew what was going on , knew not to turn off the lights . We did n't know , but they did n't come to where we were all the same . They all knew very well that he was a captain . He went out and closed the door , and we sat in his apartment . His last name was Kasumov . He 's an exserviceman , retired , works up at the fire station at some plant or other . He went out and stood at his door . They tell him , `` Comrade Captain , do n't worry , we wo n't harm you , you 're one of us . '' He went upstairs , and they say , `` Are n't you taking anything from this apartment ? '' He says , `` I do n't need anything . '' And the women who were standing in the yard . . . we have a basement , full of water . . . the women who were standing in the yard saw . Those guys , they left everything they stole on the first floor and ran upstairs again . The women threw everything they had time to into the basement , to save our property . Some things were left : dirty pillows , two or three other things and a rug . A guy came downstairs , really mad , and he says , `` Where 's the rug ? I just put it right here ! '' They tell him , '' Some guy came and took it and went off toward the school . '' He ran off in that direction . Oh ! I forgot the most important point . When Igor picked me up in his arms , there were women standing there who saw everything that was going on . They just did n't tell me about it for a long time . The wife of that military man , she did n't want to kill my spirit , I was already dead enough . Later she told me , that after they murdered Uncle Shurik in the third entryway one of them , the ringleader , apparently a young man , said , `` Where 's the girl who was here ? '' And he became furious . The woman tells him , `` She came to . . . `` She didn't know what to say : Think something up ? Someone carried her off ? Then they would comb the whole house and find me and our whole family . So the woman says , `` She came to and went to the basement . '' Now , our basement is full of water . So the whole mob dashes off to the basement to look for me or my corpse . They took flashlights ; they were up to their waists in water , water which had been standing there for years , and soot , and fuel oil . They climbed down in there to get me . Then one of them said , `` There 's so much water down there , she probably walked and walked and then passed out and died . She met her death in the basement . That 's it , we can leave , no problem ! '' I did n't know that , and when I was told , I felt worse . Two times worse . A lot worse ! So they did n't just want to pound me flat , something more awful was awaiting me . . . After that we of course did n't want to live in Sumgait any longer . We really did n't want to go back to our apartment . When we moved , I went up there and started to quiver and shake all over , because I started remembering it all . Although the neighbors all sobbed , it was all . . . so cheap . . . The people who sat in their apartments and did n't help us at a time like that . I think that they could have helped ! I do n't think that they were obligated to , but they could have helped us ! Because that one woman was able to stop that whole brutal crowd by herself . That means they could have , too . It would have been enough foe one man or women to say , What do you think you 're doing ? '' That 's all ! That would have done it . There were 60 apartments in our building . Not one person said it ! When I was lying on the ground and all those people were standing on their balconies I did n't hear anyone 's voice , no one said what are you doing , leave her alone . . . Mamma even told one of the neighbor women that if it had been an Azerbaijani woman in my place they would have dropped a bomb if it would have killed even one Armenian . They would have stood up for one of their own . True , they say that our neighbor from the fourth entryway , an old/ sick woman tried to stop the pogrom . The Azerbaijanis have a custom : if a woman takes her scarf and throws it on the ground , the men are supposed to stop immediately . The old woman from the fourth entryway did that , but they stomped her scarf into the ground , pushed her off to the side , and said , `` If you want to go on living , you 'll disappear into your apartment . '' So she left . That trick did n't work on them . Even the neighbors who helped us move told me , OK , fine , calm down , forget that it happened . I said I 'd only forget it if I told them right then that it had happened to their daughter -- and if that did n't have any effect on them , then I would forget everything , too . Imagine that it happened to your sister . And no one did anything . Anything .

( Yes , my opinion . ) I agree that there is truth in scripture . There are principles to be learned from it . Claiming that that truth is absolute , though , seems to imply a literal reading of the Bible . If it were absolute truth ( constant across time , culture , etc . ) then no interpretation would be necessary . It may be that the lessons gleaned from various passages are different from person to person . To me , that does n't mean that one person is right and the other is wrong . I believe that God transcends our simple minds , and that scripture may very well have been crafted with exactly this intent . God knows me , and knows that my needs are different from yours or anyone else 's . By claiming that scripture is absolute , then at least one person in every disputed interpretation must be wrong . I just do n't believe that God is that rigid . > > Evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture > > to be absolute truth . ( And there are plenty of other examples . ) > > Can you reconcile this ? > > Sure . The Bible preaches absolute truths . However , exactly what those > truths are is sometimes a matter of confusion . As I said , the Bible does > preach absolute truths . Sometimes those fundamental principles are crystal > clear ( at least to evangelicals ) . This is where the arrogance comes in to play . Since these principles are crystal clear to evangelicals , maybe the rest of us should just take their word for it ? Maybe it is n't at all crystal clear to *me* that their fundamental principles are either fundamental *or* principles . I think we 've established that figuring out Biblical truth is a matter of human interpretation and therefore error-prone . Yet you can still claim that some of them may be crystal clear ? Maybe to a certain segment of Christianity , but to all . > > It 's very difficult to see how you can claim something which is based > > on your own *interpretation* is absolute . > > God revealed his Truths to the world , through His Word . It is utterly > unavoidable , however , that some people whill come up with alternate > interpretations . Practically anything can be misinterpreted , especially > when it comes to matters of right and wrong . Care to deny that ? Not at all . I think it supports my position much more effectively than yours . : - ) So , I think that your position is : The Bible is absolute truth , but as we are prone to error in our interpretation , we can not reliably determine if we have figured out what that truth is . Did I get that right ? What 's the point of spending all this time claiming and defending absolute truth , when we can never know what those truths are , and we can never ( or at least should n't ) act upon them ? What practical difference can this make ? Carol Alvin caralv @ auto-trol.com

Second , ESPN 's affinity with Patrick has probably more to do with the travel/production costs for a once a week NHN ( National Hockey Night ) affair . ( ESPN-ABC owner , Capital Cities , is a company known for being quite thrifty with minimal overhead costs . It 's quite possible that Jim Schoenfeld may be working for doughnuts : - ) . Gary Thorne and Bill Clement are both NJ-based and the rest of ESPN crew resides in the suburban CT with a very close proximity to tri-state area . Plus , it makes sense in terms of solid hockey following in the NorthEast corridor ( PA-NY-NJ-DC/Maryland ) .

They are defending henrik ] themselves against AZERI AGGRESSION . BM ] Huh ? You did n't expect Azeri 's to be friendly to forces fighting with them BM ] within their borders ? Well , history is SAD . Remember , those are relocated Azeris into the Armenian LAND of KARABAKH by the STALIN regime . henrik ] At last , I hope that the U.S. insists that Turkey stay out of the henrik ] KARABAKH crisis so that the repeat of the CYPRUS invasion WILL NEVER henrik ] OCCUR again . BM ] You 're not playing with a full deck , are you ? Where would Turkey invade ? It is not up to me to speculate but I am sure Turkey would have stepped into Armenia if SHE could . BM ] Are you throwing the Cyprus buzzword around with s.c.g . in the header BM ] in hopes that the Greek netters will jump the gun ? Absolutely NOT ! I am merely trying to emphasize that in many cases , HISTORY repeats itself . BM ] Yes indeed Turkey has the military prowess to intervene , what she wishes BM ] she had , however , is the diplomatic power to stop the hostilities and bring BM ] the parties to the negotiating table . That 's hard to do when Armenians BM ] are attacking Azeri towns . So , let me understand in plain WORDS what you are saying ; Turkey wants a PEACEFUL END to this CONFLICT . NOT ! ! I will believe it when I see it . Now , as far as attacking , what do you do when you see a GUN pointing to your HEAD ? Do you sit there and WATCH or DEFEND yoursef ( fat chance ) ? Do you remember what Azeris did to the Armenians in BAKU ? All the BARBERIAN ACTS especially against MOTHERS and their CHILDREN . I mean BURNING people ALIVE ! BM ] Armenian leaders are lacking the statesmanship to recognize the BM ] futility of armed conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that BM ] leads to stability is much better than a military faits accomplis that 's BM ] going to cause incessant skirmishes . Armenians in KARABAKH want PEACE and their own republic . They are NOT asking much . They simply want to get back what was TAKEN AWAY from them and GIVEN to AZERIS by STALIN . BM ] Think of 10 or 20 years down the line -- both of the newly independent BM ] countries need to develop economically and neither one is going to wipe BM ] the other out . These people will be neighbors , would it not be better BM ] to keep the bad blood between them minimal ? Do n't get me WRONG . I also want PEACEFUL solution to the conflict . But until Azeris realize that , the Armenians in KARABAKH will defend themselves against aggresion . BM ] If you belong to the Armenian diaspora , keep in mind that what strikes BM ] your fancy on the map is costing the local Armenians dearly in terms of BM ] their blood and future . Again , you are taking different TURNS . Armenia HAS no intension to GRAB any LAND from Azerbaijan . The Armenians in KARABAKH are simply defending themselves UNTIL a solution is SET . BM ] It 's easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize BM ] craziness to have your feelings about Turks tickled . The Armenians BM ] in Armenia and N-K will be there , with the same people you seem to hate BM ] as their neighbors , for maybe 3000 years more . The sooner there 's peace in BM ] the region the better it is for them and everyone else . I 'd push for BM ] compromise if I were you instead of hitting the caps-lock and spreading BM ] inflammatory half-truths . It is NOT up to me to decide the PEACE initiative . I am absolutely for it . But , in the meantime , if you do not take care of yourself , you will be WIPED out . Such as the case in the era of 1915-20 of The Armenian Massacres .

Neither will registering a clipper chip and then substituting a '' counterfeit '' one if the serial number contains a checksum . Chances are the government has thought of this , and `` just anyone '' wo n't be permitted access to enough of the internals to make a `` fake '' clipper chip . Chances are that the government has classified some details of the internals at a very high level , and manufacturers are required to observe security safeguards and clearances corresponding to that level . While not perfect , it would prevent Joe Hacker from rolling his own spoofing chip , since not many counterfeiters can survive a background investigation . Some of the more notorious self-styled dissidents here , for example , have already got their heads so high above the tall grass that they 'd have little chance of getting a clearance . Of course it 's not impossible that someone do this , but probably extremely difficult . Chances are there will also be very heavy criminal penalties for phony clipper chips , on some national security/classified info grounds or other , thus making the game not worth the candle . -- David Sternlight Great care has been taken to ensure the accuracy of our information , errors and omissions excepted .
From : steph @ pegasus.cs.uiuc.edu ( Dale Stephenson ) Subject : `` Seer '' Stephenson picks the A.L . East Summary : The division has gone to the birds Keywords : last chance for foolishness Article-I.D . : pegasus.steph.733989466 Organization : University of Illinois , Dept . of Comp . Sci. , Urbana , IL Lines : 95 Having run completely out of time , I 've got to get my prophesies and predictions for the A.L . out . Qualifications -- one of the worse finishes in last year 's prediction contest . AL East -- 1993 1 . Baltimore Orioles Why the Orioles ? Well , I pondered long and hard , and it all came down to this : -- The Blue Jays are going the wrong direction . -- Ca n't bring myself to pick the Yankees -- Milwaukee was a fluke -- Indians are n't ready to contend -- Red Sox were bad last year , and did n't get any better -- Detroit 's pitching will be the new definition of `` replacement level '' '' But you do n't really think the Orioles will win , do you . '' No . As a matter of fact , I ca n't see any team in the American League winning either division on paper ( with the possible exception of the Yankees , who I hate ) . But some- body has to win , so I pick the Orioles . `` You do n't really think that Brady Anderson is going to repeat , do you ? '' No . I 'm basing the Orioles prediction on the expectation of big years from Cal Ripken and Glenn Davis . `` Glenn Davis ? That 's insane '' . Yes . So , without further ado : STRONG POINTS : Hoiles , Ripken some years , Olson , getting rid of Billy Ripken . WEAK POINTS : Segui may start . Valenzuela ( the original 30-something ) may be the fifth starter . Oates puts his best hitters at the bottom of the lineup . ( Does anybody else think that might be a calculated maneuver to minimize the effect of a slumping Ripken ? If you ca n't move Ripken out of the # 3 spot , why not move the rest of the line up ? ) WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN : Glenn Davis wins comeback player of the year . WOULD BE A BAD SIGN : In a tight pennant race , team trades for Pecota . ObPrediction : `` The Streak '' continues . Harold Reynolds leads the team in caught stealing . 2 . New York Yankees . STRONG POINTS : Abbot , Key , Perez . Could have best pitching in American League . Boggs should improve on Hayes . WEAK POINTS : Mattingly still considered best hitter . The Steinbrenner factor . ( The Yankees lost to the Mets . Can wholesale changes be far behind ? ) Never count on rookie pitchers ( i.e . Wickman & Millitello ) to win a division . WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN : Boggs hits over .300 WOULD BE A BAD SIGN : Howe gets arrested again . ObPrediction : Mattingly wo n't top a 700 OPS . 3 . Toronto Blue Jays STRONG POINTS : Management willing to make big deals . Management has eerie power to convince other teams its prospects are not suspects . Olerud . Guzman . Alomar . WEAK POINTS : The Jackson for Bell trade has shaken my faith in Gillick . Losing Stewart may hurt rotation ( that 's *really* a bad sign ) . No one in the outfield can get on base . Pitching is thin behind Guzman and Ward . WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN : Jack Morris considered Cy Young contender in August WOULD BE A BAD SIGN : Club makes no major deals in August . ObPrediction : Morris will post better ERA and WHIP totals than last year . And have a losing record . 4 . Milwaukee Brewers STRONG POINTS : Pitching staff was exceptional -- last year . WEAK POINTS : Molitor gone . Surhoff at third ? Why ? Eldred ca n't keep it up . WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN : Listach and Eldred play like last year . WOULD BE BAD SIGN : Bones plays like last year . ObPrediction : Surhoff wo n't finish the year at third . 5 . Cleveland Indians STRONG POINTS : Baerga , Belle , Nagy WEAK POINTS : Pitching staff thin -- losing Olin really hurts . Starts Felix Fermin . WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN : Bielecki 's ERA is consistent with his Atlanta starts . WOULD BE A BAD SIGN : Ted Power -- bullpen ace . ObPrediction : Alomar will be back on the DL by the all-star break . 6 . Boston Red Sox STRONG POINTS : Clemens , Viola , Clemens , Detroit , Clemens WEAK POINTS : Most incompetent GM in baseball . Key free agent signing -- Andre Dawson . Burks is gone -- Hatcher in center . WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN : Rainouts in between Clemens starts . WOULD BE A BAD SIGN : Clemens on the DL ObPrediction : Russell will make Sox fans forget Reardon . Interpret that how you will : - > 7 . Detroit Tigers STRONG POINTS : Tettleton , Phillips , Whitaker WEAK POINTS : If Fielder keeps declining , he 'll be a shortstop this year . Worst rotation in baseball entirely replaced -- but not necessarily better . This year could be *very* ugly . WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN : Cecil Fielder deserving the MVP .

The third-party media adapters are usually cheaper ( at least in Toronto ) than Apple 's . I bought the adapters from Asante instead of Apple . gurman @ umbra.gsfc.nasa.gov ( Joseph B. Gurman ) writes : > The DECstation 5000 Models 200 and 240 come with ThinWire only > ( ca n't say for certain about the Models 125 and 133 ) , so your best bet That 's not true . Only the DECstation 5000/200 comes with a Thinwire ( BNC , coaxial ) Ethernet connector . The 5000/25 , 5000/133 and 5000/240 all have a single 15-pin AUI Ethernet connector only . I distinctly remembered this because when got the 5000/200 first and I thought all of them are going to be Thinwire . I eventually had to go back and ordered DESTAs ( DEC 's oversized version of an AUI-to-BNC adapter that MUST be used with a transciever cable ) for the rest of the stations . My advise to the very original poster ( Beverly ? ) is : ( 1 ) If all you want is to create a LAN with two workstations and wo n't add machines to it EVER , go for Thinwire regardless of the media type . Going for UTP ( unshielded twisted pair ) wiring requires a concentrator which means extra money and I believe these units come with at least 6 ports . As for Thicknet , it 's a nightmare and cabling is expensive . Avoid it unless you have no choice ( e.g . the two machines are two floors parts ) . ( 2 ) On the Mac side , you will need : - one Thinwire media adapter ( from Apple or third-party ) . - MacX ( make sure you get version 1.2 ; 1.1.7 wo n't run on System 7.1 ) . - MacTCP ( which comes with MacX ; if you get MacX v1.2 , you should be getting MacTCP v1.1.1 with it . Do n't use earlier versions on a Centris ) . - you may or may not need a 25ohm terminator depending on the Thinwire media adapter . So just ask the sales if the adapter is self-terminated or not . - configure MacTCP to use `` Ethernet '' . ( 3 ) On the DECstation side , you will need : - for a Model 200 , you will only need a T-connector . - for Models 25 , 125 , 133 , 240 , you will need an AUI-to-BNC adapter . Get one that can be plugged in directly to the AUI port of the DECstation . This way you save the cost of a transciever cable ( a 15-pin AUI male to a 15-pin AUI female cable ) . - get a 25ohm terminator .

Okay ... I argued this thoroughly about 3-4 weeks ago . Men and women are different ... physically , physiologically , and psychologically . Much recent evidence for this statement is present in the book `` Brainsex '' by Anne Moir and David Jessel . I recommend you find a copy and read it . Their book is an overview of recent scientific research on this topic and is well referenced . Now , if women and men are different in some ways , the law can only adequately take into account their needs in these areas where they are different by also taking into account the ways in which men and women are different . Maternity leave is an example of this -- it takes into account that women get pregnant . It does not give women the same rules it would give to men , because to treat women like it treats men in this instance would be unjust . This is just simply an obvious example of where men and women are intrinsically different ! ! ! ! ! Now , people make the _naive_ argument that sexism = oppression . However , maternity leave is sexist because MEN DO NOT GET PREGNANT . Men do not have the same access to leave that women do ( not to the same extent or degree ) , and therefore IT IS SEXIST . No matter however much a man _wants_ to get pregnant and have maternity leave , HE NEVER CAN . And therefore the law IS SEXIST . No man can have access to maternity leave , NO MATTER HOW HARD HE TRIES TO GET PREGNANT . I hope this is clear . Maternity leave is an example where a sexist law is just , because the sexism here just reflects the `` sexism '' of nature in making men and women different . There are many other differences between men and women which are far more subtle than pregnancy , and to find out more of these I recommend you have a look at the book `` Brainsex '' . Your point that perhaps some day men can also be pregnant is fallacious . If men can one day become pregnant it will be by having biologically become women ! To have a womb and the other factors required for pregnancy is usually wrapped up in the definition of what a woman is -- so your argument , when it is examined , is seen to be fallacious . You are saying that men can have the sexist maternity leave privilege that women can have if they also become women -- which actually just supports my statement that maternity leave is sexist . > The discrimination comes in when a woman is denied opportunities > because of her ( legally determined ) sexual inferiorities . As I > understand most religious sexual discrimination , and I doubt that > Islam is exceptional , the female is not allowed into the priestly > caste and in general is subjugated so that she has no aspirations to > rights which , as an equal human , she ought to be entitled to . There is no official priesthood in Islam -- much of this function is taken by Islamic scholars . There are female Islamic scholars and female Islamic scholars have always existed in Islam . An example from early Islamic history is the Prophet 's widow , Aisha , who was recognized in her time and is recognized in our time as an Islamic scholar . > No matter how sweetly you coat it , part of the role of religions > seems , historically , to have served the function of oppressing the > female , whether by forcing her to procreate to the extent where > there is no opportunity for self-improvement , or by denying her > access to the same facilities the males are offered . You have no evidence for your blanket statement about all religions , and I dispute it . I could go on and on about women in Islam , etc. , but I recently reposted something here under the heading `` Islam and Women '' -- if it is still at your news-site I suggest you read it . It is reposted from soc.religion.islam , so if it has disappeared from alt.atheism it still might be in soc.religion.islam ( I forgot what its original title was though ) .

Every city and suburban police officer I 've seen around the Twin Cities in the last two years has carried a semi-auto of some type ( different brands though I have n't seen any Glock 's ) . With regard to this discussion : We are getting dangerously far from the usual rantings of t.p.g , and close to the realm of r.g , but I 'd like to put my two cents worth in . While there 's nothing wrong with a revolver ( especially a large frame S & W in .357 magnum - my favorite ) there are valid advantages to semi-autos . I suggest reading Massad Ayoob 's ( I know , some people ca n't stand him and think he 's full of bull , but I think that in general his material is very valid and useful ) book _The Semi Auto Pistol in Police Work_ ( or something like that ) . He defines a number of ways that semi-auto 's are different , and that '' different is good '' . The main advantage is not in increased firepower , but in more accurate followup shots when you go to single action mode . There is also a certain `` propriatory nature '' of each gun that takes some familiarity to learn . This may have diminished with time as more criminals become familiar with different models of semi-autos , but it was cited as stopping or at least slowing down criminals who had grabbed a police officers gun . | > | > Define `` armed better '' .

Yes , but this is best done with a two hand hold . With a single hand you either pull the gun far off target to cock , or must fire double action . The DA semi auto has the same advantages plus is always SA after the first shot . | > - A misfire in a revolver merely means you must pull the trigger again | > to rotate to the next round . I 'm not sure if this is meant to be different from your first point . In a DA semi-auto you can pull the trigger again to try dropping the hammer on the same round - an advantage you do n't have in a revolver where the next trigger pull will always go to the next round ( discussing this point now ) . This is fine with a dud but what about a hangfire situation ? Granted it 's very rare , but your round will now go off confined in the cylinder with no place to go .

Can be faster depending on users . The best speedloader users , especially those using the spring loaded speed loaders are very fast . A problem is that ejecting the spent cases is a two handed job where dropping the expended magazine is one handed . This means that while you can be inserting a fresh magazine as soon as the old one clears the gun , with a speed loader you have to go through more motions that will always take more time . You also do n't have the advantage of tactical reloads ( replacing a partial magazine to bring you back to full capacity - the partial magazine can still be used if needed later ) . | > | > - A misfire in a semi-auto will require you to clear a jammed shell | > first , time spent which can be fatal .

Yes , the time to recognize the problem is just as important as the time to clear it . Really though , in either a revolver or semi-auto the odds of an actual misfire with factory ammo are awfully small . You are more likely to get a jam in a semi-auto but even these are exceptionally rare with modern quality guns ( Sigs , Glocks , et.al. ) . | > - Most semi-autos must have the slide worked to chamber the first round | > and cock the hammer .

All common semi-auto 's can be carried with a round in their chamber without any safety problems . While I put that out as a statement that I believe , I should say that this applies to all of the ones I 've looked at . For the DA semi 's it's no different from the revolver situation : The guns all have hammer or firing pin blocks . They also have a safety . Because there 's no real advantage carrying one of these cocked and locked you have the same safety and speed of employment as a revolver , plus the advantage of SA followup shots . I'm not familiar with SA semi-autos except for the 1911-A1 . I admit that I was initially skeptical about carrying this cocked and locked , but after examining the design , trying to defeat the safeties ( gun unloaded of course ) , and shooting it a lot , I see no inherent safety problems with it , especially in a thumbreak holster with the strap under the hammer . This design also gets you more speed for an accurate first shot than a revolver . | > | > Some police departments switched to Glocks , and then started quietly | > switching many officers back to the old revolvers .

I still ca n't figure out how it 's worse than a revolver for safety . If you do n't pull the trigger it does n't go off . I imagine that if all your revolver shooting was done double action then you could pull the Glock trigger far enough to fire before you realized it . In addition , if you had developed that nasty habit of keeping your finger on the trigger when holstering your gun and relying on your thumb on the hammer to remind you to take it off before you blew off your foot then you 'd have problems when the hammer was n't there . | > | > Anyone who goes anyone saying that the criminals obviously outgun | > the police do n't know nothing about firearms .

I have the poor man 's Beretta ( Taurus 99 ) and consider it inferior as a carry weapon to the Springfield .45 ( oops , 9mm vs. 45 arguments are relegated to r.g ) . You are right , though . If you do n't hit what you aim at then the shooter/gun combination has failed . I do n't ascribe failures in the the fire real fast with a wonder-nine scenario you mention to the gun . This is a shooter failure , whether through lack of discipline or lack of training . | > | > What do crooks overwhelmingly use in crime ?

Well , if you put things into historical perspective , the Turks moved into an area , which was inhabited by Greeks . This is how the history between the two nations started some centuries ago . Since then , it has been a continuous battle between the two nations . From my perspective I ca n't see why I should say that Greeks have been responsible for what has happened between the two nations . Of course , it would not be reasonable to argue that the hostility should drag till we kick the Turks out of this area . This isn't going to happen , so the best would be to improve the relations between the two countries . A golden oportunity exists with Cyprus . If things ca n't work there , there is n't any possible way that could work between our nations . > When it comes to conflicts like our countries having you can not > blame one side only , there always are bad guys on both sides . > What were you doing on Anatolia after the WW1 anyway ? > Do you think it was your right to be there ?

Yes , I am pro-gun , and yes , I do disagree with this statement . Nuclear weapons in and of themselves are dangerous . Radioactive decay of plutonium and uranium , as well as the tritium in the weapon , tends to be somewhat dangerous to living things . ( Can you say `` neutron flux '' ? ) Plus these things have no self- defense purposes . It 's kinda hard to justify their use as a militia weapon when at best they are meant for battlefield use ( low-yield weapons ) or at worst for industrial target obliteration ( translation : cities and population centers ) . Not to mention that for it to be used as a militia weapon and expect the user to live requires some sort of launch vehicle . . . aaron arc @ cco.caltech.edu

Lines : 30 I am a novice ( at best ) in working with pc networks , and am in the process of planning a small accounting system for a small business . The particular need in this case is for three machines , each in a different office of the same building , each having access to a Windows-based accounting system . My first thought is to set up MS Windows for Workgroups on each of the machines ( likely a 486 and two 386 's ) along with the appropriate Ethernet cards and cabling that come with the Windows for Workgroups starter kit ( one additional user kit will be necessary ) . It then seems logical to purchase a simple multi-user accounting system , along the lines of DacEasy or M.Y.O.B. , and fire it all up ! The 486 will more or less act as server with a report/check printer attached to it . Cable runs of 30-40 feet will be necessary for this setup . Well , this all seems too easy to me . Would any of you network gurus out there tell me if I am out of my mind here ? Any and all suggestions , however trivial , will be immensely appreciated .

The 2600 had some extra ASIC chips that were basically modified graphics chips and PIA 's for the joysticks . Later model 2600 might have incorporated many of the chips into one ASCI , as the weight of the machines and part count decreased a lot over the years . Additionally , I think the 2600 used 2K , 4K , and up to 8K of ROM for their games . I have no idea how much RAM it had to work with , but I would hazard a guess of 2 or 4K RAM . Think comes from a lot of hacking with the 800 and 130xe computers . And occasionally hacking with the 2600 ( fixing it for monitor composite video use , and audio hookups ) . Also I tryed to make a cartridge-less system that stored the ROM into a RAM cartridge that could be loaded up at some prior time ( a way to backup cartridges ) . I 've heard of a setup like this where games could be bought ( cheaply ) on FSK-recorded tapes , then you would load them into a special RAM cartidge , and play them . Anyways , if you 're interested in looking for 2600 equipment , we 've got two 2600 machines around ( one composite A/V modified ) , and lotsa cartridges .

Considering the caliber of people running this city , > there 's no telling what we 're going to have leering down at us from orbit . I would just like to point out that it is much easier to place an object at orbital altitude than it is to place it with orbital velocity . For a target 300 km above the surface of Earth , you need a delta-v of 2.5 km/s . Assuming that rockets with specific impulses of 300 seconds are easy to produce , a rocket with a dry weight of 50 kg would require only about 65 kg of fuel+oxidizer . A small dispersal charge embedded in about 20 kg of sand or birdshot ( depending on the nature of the structure ) would be the payload . I am sure the whole project is well within the capability of the amateur rocketry community . It sounds like a good Science Fair project -- 'Reduction of Light Pollution Through Applied Ballistics ' . Or , it could be part of the Challenge Prize being discussed here : $ 1 billion for the first person to spend 1 year on the moon , $ 1 million for the first erradication of an orbital eyesore/CCD burner . I wouldpledge $ 1000 for the first person to bring it down , and I am sure there are at least 999 other astronomers , nature lovers , or just plain people of good taste who would do likewise .

Subject : HELP : is my monitor dying ? ? ? From : edwin @ ccu1.aukuni.ac.nz ( Edwin Ng ) Organization : University of Auckland , New Zealand . Lines : 25 Hi . Recently my svga monitor has been acting up by taking about 3 minutes to warm up . Previously , when I first start up my PC I can see all the CMOS messages ( RAM test ... etc ) but now I 've got to wait for about 3min before the display shows anything and it starts up with a bright white flash . This only happens when the system has been off for a long time ( eg overnight ) . If it was only off for a couple of hours and then turned on again , the display works as normal like before . Does anyone know what is causing this ? Is it a warning that it will give up soon or just signs of aging ( the system is a 386sx and its about 3 yrs old ) . I 've used systems at work for years and never seen this happen to a monitor yet . I 'd really appreciated any help that you fellow netters can offer . Thanks a lot .

'' > [ insert huge deletion of all following material since it had little relevance to what I 've found ] OK . The people before Jesus did n't have Jesus , right ( so far , I've announced that space is a vacuum ) ? The people who lived during the time Jesus lived ( especially disciples ) were taught this : `` I tell you the truth , anyone who has faith in me will do what I have been doing . He will do even greater things than these , because I am going to the Father . And I will do whatever you ask in my name , so that the Son may bring glory to the Father . You may ask me for anything in my name , and I will do it . '' ( John 14:12-14 ) So , Jesus asked them to pray for things in his name . Since that time , the request has been the same , not to ask for intercession from other beings , but from Jesus . Remember that `` there is one God and one mediator between God and men , the man Christ Jesus , who gave himself as a ransom for all men -- the testimony given in its proper time . '' ( 1 Timothy 2:5-6 . Also , `` there have been many of those priests [ talking about priests among the Hebrews ] , since death prevented them from continuing in office ; but because Jesus lives forever , he has a permanent priesthood . Therefore he is able to save completely those who come to God through him , because he always lives to intercede for them . '' ( Hebrews 7:23-25 ) . Hebrews is also full of areas talking about Jesus being our mediator rather than any other man . Joe Fisher [ `` The people before Jesus did n't have Jesus , right '' may not be as obvious as you think . In what sense to you mean did n't have ? Christian thought has generally said that they had Jesus in the sense that they were saved by his death . God is not bound by our chronology . So in some real spiritual sense they did `` have Jesus '' . Even in terms of knowledge , while they surely did n't have the explicit knowledge that we have , Christians have normally seen messianic prophecy as knowledge of Jesus , even if knowledge from afar . -- clh ]

I would agree entirely with these three paragraphs . But did the Hurt study make any distinction between an *ability* to swerve and a *failure* to swerve ? In most of the accidents and near accidents that I 've seen , riders will almost always stand on the brakes as hard as they dare , simply because the instinct to brake in the face of danger is so strong that it over-rides everything else . Hard braking and swerving tend to be mutually exclusive manouvres - did Hurt draw any conclusions on which one is generally preferable ?
From : SHAGBERG @ vm.cmp.ilstu.edu Subject : updated keyboard question for the plus Organization : Illinois State University Lines : 44 I have an old Mac Plus .

I know one 's a ground , one gets the serial signal , one supplies 5 volts , and i forgot what the fourth one does . anyway , if you hook them up wrong you 'll fry a board and i < really > do n't want to do < that > . if any brave souls out there have done this before , please e-mail your experience directly to me . i would greatly appreciate it especially since apple 's original keyboard is not . . . ergonomically correct . btw , i did take apart my new keyboard to see if i could find the correlation between the wires for the rj-11 jack and the adb since it has both , but no such luck ( the connections are soldered inside of little boxes ) . Oh , well . . . one more thing : in case you are thinking that the ABD ports on the newer models are different from the connection used on the plus -- - you 're right . however , you can use the telephone cable from the plus and connect the mac-pro-plus keyboard via its own rj-11 jack . in other words , this little engineering feat i wish to do *is* possible . it 's merely a matter of finding out the correct order . omt , when i get this to work , i definitely will post the solution so others can , too . thanx for the input . ***************************************************************** * Tis the blink of an eye , tis the draught of a breath , * * From the blossoms of health , to the paleness of death , * * From the gilded saloon , to the briar in the shroud , * * O , why should the spirit of mortal be proud ? * * -William Knox * ***************************************************************** * shagberg @ vm.cmp.ilstu.edu * *****************************************************************

I have to agree Matthew with this ; I have certainly encountered a lot of anti-Catholic-religion propaganda & emotion ( & some bigotry ) from members of certain religious groups here . They also practice their missionary work with zeal among Catholics in the United States , but to someone who is or was raised Catholic such rhetoric is pretty off-putting .

The MacRescue board clips onto the 68000 on the MB . It also has a 68000 itself . Periodically I have to remove the clip ( not an entirely easy thing to do ) and clean the `` legs '' of the 68000 . Larry Pina 's book asserts that this is occasionally a problem with snap on upgrades : the 68000 's `` legs '' will oxidize , causing unusual system errors . Well , that 's me . So , I would like to do something permanent , and I think it would be fairly easy to put a socket in where the 68000 currently is , and modify the MacRescue board to plug in . What I 'm not 100 % sure of is whether it will work . It seems to me that the two 68000s aren't acting independently ; so removing one should n't have any effect on the performance of my Mac .

I recall our double buffer > has other image color and one b & w -- that does n't help either . > Maybe I should dump photos to screen with low level code ; how ? A few years ago a friend and I took some 256 grey-level photos from a 1 bit Mac Plus screen using this method . Displaying all 256 levels synchronized to the 60Hz display took about 10 seconds . After experimenting with different aperture settings and screen brightnesses we found a range that worked well , giving respectable contrast . The quality of the images was pretty good . There were no visible contrast bands . To minimize the exposure time the display program built 255 different 1 bit frames . The first contained a dot only for pixels that had value 255 , the second only for pixels that had value 254 , etc . These frames were stored using a sparse data structure that was very fast to 'or ' onto the screen in sequence . Creating these frames sometimes took 5-10 minutes on that old Mac , but the camera shutter was closed during that time anyway . And yes , we wrote directly to the screen memory . Mea culpa . Our biggest problem was that small images were displayed in the top left corner of the screen instead of the center . It took an extra week to have the film developed and printed , because the processors took the trouble to manually move the all images into the center of the print . Who 'd have guessed ? regards , Jon Rowlands

'' No one was ever flogged , beaten , burned , fed to the lions , or killed in any other way because of a belief in the resurrection - sorry to disappoint you . The idea of resurrection is one which can be found in a host of different forms in the religions of antiquity . The problem was not the resurrection which was a mediorce issue for a tiny fragment of the Jewish population ( the Saducees ) but was a non issues for everyone else . The real problem was that Christians were pacifist and preached there was only one god . When the state operates by a system of divinitation of the emperor - monotheism becomes a capital offense . The Jews were able to get exemption from this , and were also not evangelistic . Christians were far more vocal , and gentile , and hence dangerous and were therefore targets of persecution . Also since Christians were a relatively powerless group , they made good scapegoats as is seen by Nero 's blaming them for the burning of Rome . Let 's not cloud the issues with the resurrection . randy [ I agree with you that Christians were not persecuted specifically because they believed in resurrection . However the beliefs that did cause trouble were dependent on belief in the resurrection of Jesus . Of course the problem with it is that there are alternatives other than a great conspiracy . The most common theory among non-Christians scholars seems to be that the resurrection was a subjective event -- in effect , a delusion . -- clh ]

Simple -- if you have a choice between : 1 . American manufacturers peddling Cripple Chips with a secret untested algorithm whose keys are held by people with a history of untrustworthy behavoir , or 2 .

If the answer is positive , you would know if ms-windows is a `` mature '' OS . Days ago people doubted that ms-windows is not a real OS . I can see why they have such question . Ms-windows confuses many people . Microsoft simulated Mac , but it did a lousy job . For example : ( 1 ) You can not create hierarchy groups . There is no way to create a group in a group . ( If you know how , please tell me . ) ( 2 ) Too many system parameters to take care of . ( 3 ) uncomplete documentation . It 's not easy to find the reason why causes an unpredictable error . ( 4 ) Group deleting/file deleting After deleting a group , users have to use file manager to delete files . But if users forget to delete some related files , the disk will be full of nonsense files . ( 5 ) share problem Once you create two windows doing compilation and editing in some language ( w/o good editor ) , there will be a sharing problem . You just can not open or save the program if it is loaded . It makes sense to prevent from saving , but not opening . Microsoft try to compromise between DOS and windows , but they just make ms-windows a graphical DOS with capacity doing mutiple DOS jobs ; the worst thing is they complicate the environment . The orginal purpose of ms-windows should be to simplify the environment , and make PC easier to use . It 's by no means easy to satisfy everybody , but if Microsoft want to keep their reputations , they should evaluate the user interface more carefully before products distribute . No flame , please .

Just to clarify , the 3D routines that are mentioned in various places on the mac are in a libray , not the ROM of the mac . A few years ago before I knew anything about implementing graphics , I came across a demo of the Apple GrafSys3D library and it actually did a lot . However , it is quite limited in the sense that it 's a low-level 3D library ; your code still has to plot individual points , draw each line , etc ad nauseum . It has nothing on GL , for example , where you can handle objects . Other things to consider when talking about Apple 's old 3D GrafSys library : * Unsupported ; never was and no plans exist to do so in the future * Undocumented ; unless you call header files documentation ... If one knows something about graphics , you could probably figure it out , but I 'd assume there 's better software available that gives better output and is , at the same time , programmatically nicer ( i.e . easier to program ) .

Are you suggesting that we should forget the cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people by the Armenians between 1914 and 1920 ? But most people are n't aware that in 1939 Hitler said that he would pattern his elimination of the Jews based upon what the Armenians did to Turkish people in 1914 . 'After all , who remembers today the extermination of the Tartars ? ' ( Adolf Hitler , August 22 , 1939 : Ruth W. Rosenbaum ( Durusoy ) , `` The Turkish Holocaust - Turk Soykirimi '' , p . 213 . ) I refer to the Turks and Kurds as history 's forgotten people . It does not serve our society well when most people are totally unaware of what happened in 1914 where a vicious society , run by fascist Armenians , decided to simply use the phoniest of pretexts as an excuse , for wiping out a peace-loving , industrious , and very intelligent and productive ethnic group . What we have is a demand from the fascist government of x-Soviet Armenia to redress the wrongs that were done against our people . And the only way we can do that is if we can catch hold of and not lose sight of the historical precedence in this very century . We can not reverse the events of the past , but we can and we must strive to keep the memory of this tragedy alive on this side of the Atlantic , so as to help prevent a recurrence of the extermination of a people because of their religion or their race . Which means that I support the claims of the Turks and Kurds to return to their lands in x-Soviet Armenia , to determine their own future as a nation in their own homeland . Serdar Argic 'We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the Turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination . ' ( Ohanus Appressian - 1919 ) 'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists a single Turkish soul . ' ( Sahak Melkonian - 1920 )

But it is quite a leap in logic to observe one situation where anecdotal evidence led nowhere and therefore conclude that anecdotal evidence will NEVER lead anywhere . I 'm sure somebody here can provide an example where anecdotal evidence ( and the interpretation of it ) was upheld/verified by follow-on rigorous clinical trials . > I tend to disagree- I think anecdotal evidence , provided there is a lot of it , > and it is fairly consistent , will is very important .

As I 've pointed out > person 's `` make-believe '' can easily be another person 's reality ... Good point . There has been a tendency by some on this newsgroup to `` circle the wagons '' to the viewpoint that anecdotal medical evidence is worthless ( maybe to counter the claims of those who are presenting anecdotal evidence to support controversial subjects , such as the `` yeast hypothesis '' ) . But evidence is evidence - it requires a `` jury '' or a process to sort it out and determine the truth from the junk . Medicine must continue to strive to better understand the workings of the body/mind for the purpose of alleviating illness - anecdotal evidence is just one piece of the puzzle ; it is not worthless .

I do n't really know the difference | > between the various Protestant denominations . Here in America people tend to think of choosing a church much like they think of choosing a car or a country club . What I mean is that our culture is such that we tend towards satisfying our own wants rather than considering things with others in mind and not making prayer an initial and primary part of the decision process . People tend to treat church as they would a club and when something is less than to their liking , off they go to another one . I think that scripture presents the idea that God takes a different perspective on the `` church choosing process '' . It seems to me from 1Cor 12 that God does n't subscribe to the idea of us choosing a church at all but that he places us in the body as he wants us . So , I think a better question is not how do I choose a church but how do I figure out where God is trying to place me . If a person was instrumental in leading you to Christ , the church they go to is a logical first choice . You have been born into the family of God . People should hop around from church to church as often as they hop from natural family to family . If you met the Lord on your own ( so to speak ) there may not be an easily identifiable church to try for starters . Here you are more like an orphan . Prayerfully go and `` leave yourself on a few doorsteps '' and see if anyplace feels like home . I would n't expect that God want to place you in a church where you have difficulty fitting in with the people , but on the other hand there are no perfect churches . If you have an attitude of looking for problems you will both find them and make them . On the other hand if you have an attitude of love and committment , you will spread that wherever you go . In general , I think that God will try to place you in a church that talks about the Lord in the way that you have come to know him and is expanding on that base . -- Peter White disclaimer : None of what is written necessarily reflects a view of my company .

Maybe cyclical is not the best word . That is one aspect of it . In the case of the virgin birth prophecy , it applied to the then and there , and also prophetically to Christ . The army that threatened the king would cease to be a threat in a very short time . Yet it also prophecied of Christ . Several prophecies that refered to Christ also had application at the time they were made . `` Out of Egypt have I called my Son '' refers both to Israel , and prophetically to Christ . `` Why do the heathen rage '' was said of David and also of Christ .

I know the truth which I would never get my $ 697 back , but I wish to get my money back as close as possible . Here is the describtion of the package ... Nishika 3D camera It takes very good picture , never been opended or used . It came with wide angle flesh , carring case , film , and a instruction video . It has four lens and created a 3D effect on a regular 35mm film . Jewelry It came with the package as additional gift . Bahama vacation voucher The voucher is good for two RT airfare to Freeport . The users get a special hotel rate of $ 27 per-person per-night . Meals , ground transfer , hotel tax is _not_ included . Las Vegas , Reno , Orlando The voucher provides one RT airfare , and hotel accomodation for 3 days/ 2 nights . Meals , ground transfer , hotel tax is not included . The voucher is good for all 3 locations , but you ca n't travel to all 3 places at once . Cancun , Mexico The voucher provides one RT airfare , and hotel accomodation for 3 days / 2 nights . Meals and ground transfer , hotel tax is not included as usual . I paid $ 697 for the whole package . So try not to be cold-blooded when you make your offer . Details would be provided by request . I do wish to sell the whole package at once . So if you are just looking for the vacation vouchers , I do n't care if you sell the camera to other for a higher pric If you are interested in the camera , you could treat the vacation vouchers as gift . If you receive a letter in your mail box which says that you are selected to be part of the sweeptake and you have at least one out of five awards . Trust me , you would get the exactly the same package as I did . There is only one award which will be given away . So do n't bother even to call them back , if you are really interested , you could get it from me for a cheaper price . And you could receive the package within a week ( I waited three months to get my first and final packages ) . Also , they would ask for your credit card number and you have to pay for the interest to the credit card company . So why spend more than you should when you could get them from me for a cheaper price . If you are interested , please reply to me as soon as posible . I really wish to get this over with . Make me an offer , if I am confortable with your offer , I would send the package by U.P.S . the next day morning . More details could be given if you wish .

So , like , what do you do during those six months to be `` active ? '' My town has a similar requirement , and it 's rather stupid . Before you can buy a handgun , you have to be an active member of a gun club . Well , how active can you be without a gun , chief ? Most gun owners feel a check of criminal records for crimes and mental disorders would be a very good thing -- IF it could n't be abused by the government . But every time this is proposed , there is always some trapdoor by which the government can deny your purchase EVEN IF you are perfectly qualified to own a gun . And we oppose this . > It 's a little like getting a drivers licence is n't it ? ? ? > You have to prove that you CAN drive before you are allowed to ... Since the fatal accident rate for licensed automobile drivers in the US is around 50 times the fatal accident rate of largely unlicensed gun owners , I 'd think twice before using this analogy . Besides , the problem is criminal use of guns , not accidents . ( There are about 500,000 criminal uses of guns in the US every year -- but only 1,400 accidents . ) I do n't think it 's necessary to spend a lot of energy making sure a criminal CAN shoot a gun before he gets one . Just like the check , most gun owners feel positively about requiring safety courses -- IF they could n't be abused by the government . But they already have ! One state does n't hold the courses , another does n't fund them , a third holds them only once a year with limited attendence to those with political connections . Is this fair ? > Most criminals accuire guns to use them in crimes , and mostly short > time befor the crime . And how many of them acquire these guns from legal retail outlets ? How many are borrowed , stolen , smuggled , bought on the black market ? > Use of knives : > It IS allowed to cary knifes in public , but not in your belt or 'open ' . > You ( Americans ) think it 's ok to have a gun , but not to carry it open > in public -rigth ? ? Some states allow ONLY open carry . Some allow ONLY concealed carry . Some allow both . Some allow both , but require licenses for concealed carry . All you can say is if one of these modes has a clear advantage over another in terms of reducing crime or any other public good , then state legislators SOMEPLACE are doing exactly the wrong thing . Which means that they really do n't have any objective reasons for these laws other than their preferences -- a bad way to govern . > Scandinavians ARE 'aggressive ' : > We northeners are not as hot-livered as southeners , but when we decide > to take action we DO .

'' ) > Individual vs masses : > Yes the individual is more important than the masses , but only to some > extent ... . > Your criminal laws are to protect the individuals who makes the masses ? ? > What happens when the rigths of some individuals affects the rights of > all the others ? ? Typically , the only criminals who can affect the rights of ALL the other people are criminals in government offices . The rest of our criminals affect the rights of only one or a few people at a time , and they do this during the commission of a crime . POSSESSION of a gun by someone hurts NO ONE else . It is when they do something violent with that gun that the crime occurs . Of course , it is a crime for a felon or ex-felon to possess a gun , but we do n't feel it is right to treat common citizens who have lived good lives as if they were just `` pre-felons '' waiting to commit crimes . > We should n't mix weapons and items that can serve as one ... . I do n't understand this sentence . > IF i lived in Amerika I would probably have a gun to defend myselfe in HOME . > But should it have to be like that ? ? Life is n't fair . I should n't need a fire extinguisher either , or flood and theft insurance , or to lock the doors of my house and car . But pining for a better world wo n't do anything to address what I have to do to live in this one . > Do you think it 's wise to sell guns like candy ( some states do ... ) ? ? None of ours , I 'm sure . > If you believe it 's smart/neccacery to have drivers-licence WHY do you think > it should be free to buy guns ? ? Frankly , I 'm not sure I know what good a driver 's license does anyone , either . The people who drive safely never use it , and the people who drive drunk , drive without it ! However , a car is a good tool , but not one that protects my right to life .

The question is not whether or not you want to own guns personally . It's whether or not you think that ALL people should be forced to do as you do .

From : pcaster @ mizar.usc.edu ( Dodger ) Subject : Re : Dodger Question Organization : University of Southern California , Los Angeles , CA Lines : 31 Distribution : usa NNTP-Posting-Host : mizar.usc.edu The Dodgers have been shopping Harris to other teams in their quest for more left-handed pitching . So far , no takers . Personally , I think Harris is a defensive liability , and he has also led the team in past years for hitting into double plays , or at least been among the leaders . Sharperson showed last year that if given a chance to play every day , he can get the job done . If Sharpy played just one base every day , say third , he 'd also improve defensively . Wallach has helped tremendously on defense , as has Reed . The improved defense is quite noticeable and is having an effect on the pitching staff . Both Astacio AND Martinez were bailed out in recent starts by great defensive plays . Martinez pitched into the ninth in a game that might have seen him lifted in the third in past years . Astacio lasted 7 innings the other day under similar circumstances . The Dodgers are turning double plays , and keeping more balls in the infield than last year . And Piazza has also been great on defense . He has thrown out 10 of 14 batters trying to steal and has at least one pick off at first . Wallach , clearly , has contributed to the over all improvement on defense . But his offense is awful and he has cost the Dodgers some runs . But I do n't think he is as bad as his current average . I suspect he will come out of this slump much as Davis and Straw seem to have come out of theirs . Dodger

The 3FGx has a maximum horizontal scan rate of 49KHz , so driving it at 60.24KHz to get 1024 x 768 on the Mac is WAY BEYOND the tolerance The 4FG is spec'ed at 57KHz , so going 60.24KHz is only 5-6 % above the minimally guaranteed figure .

Officials of the militia , Amal , led local journalists through the catacomb- like alleys and showed them two cells with iron doors at the village , Kawthariyet al Siyad , near Tyre , the ancient port city , about 40 miles south of Beirut .

That does n't worry me at all ; they 're not going to cheat at something they can get caught at . And key size is one of the things that can be verified externally . Feed lots of random key/input pairs into the chip , then try flipping random key bits , and see what happens to the output . We already know what *should* happen -- about half the output bits should vary , on average , from a 1-bit key change or input change . If they were out to build a weak cryptosystem , it might be the case that some of the bits are much less powerful than others , in the sense that they only enter into the encryption very late in the game . By contrast , DES was designed to use each key bit as early as possible ; the 50 % output change rate appears as early as round 5 . Again , though , I do n't think NSA is going to cheat that crudely ; they 're likely to get caught . Consider a cryptosytem that starts out by XORing bits 23 and 47 , and not using either of these bits except through this XOR . This system makes early use of every bit . but an exhaustive key search would now only have 2^79 keys to search . Your test by varying single key bits would n't turn up anything interesting . Remember that they 've promised to let a committee of outside experts see the cryptosystem design . If you assume something DES-like , a biased subkey generation schedule will stick out like a sore thumb . The algorithm I suggest above would stick out like a sore thumb , but I 'm sure I could design a system with a more subtle key redundancy which was well-hidden , but would still make an exhaustive key search take far less than 2^80 encryptions . I do n't believe your claim that the real keysize can be verified externally . Andy Latto andyl @ harlequin.com

From : robin @ ntmtv.com ( Robin Coutellier ) Subject : Critique of Pressure Point Massager Originator : robin @ volans Nntp-Posting-Host : volans Reply-To : robin @ ntmtv.com ( Robin Coutellier ) Organization : Northern Telecom Inc , Mountain View , CA Distribution : na Lines : 141 As promised , below is a personal critique of a Pressure Point Massager I recently bought from the Self Care Catalog . I am very pleased with the results . The catalog description is as follows : The Pressure Point Massager is an aggressive physical massager that actually kneads the tension out of muscles ... much like a professional shiatsu masseur . The powerful motor drives two counter-rotating `` thumbs '' that move in one-inch orbits -- releasing tension in the neck , back , legs and arms . Pressure Point Massager A2623 $ 109 To order or receive a catalog , call ( 24 hours , 7 days ) 1-800-345-3371 or fax at 1-800-345-4021 . ******** NOTE : When I ordered the massager , the item number was different , and the price was $ 179 , not $ 109 . When I received it , I glanced thru the newer catalog enclosed with it to see anything was different from the first one . I was QUITE annoyed to see a $ 70 difference in price . I called them about it , and the cust rep said that they had switched manufacturers , although it looks and works exactly the same . He told me to go ahead and return the first one and order the cheaper one , using the price difference as a reason for return . In fact , since the newer ones might take a while to ship from the factory ( I received this one in 3 days ) , he told me I could use the one I already have until the new one arrives , then return the old one . VERY reasonable people . ******** I have long-term neck , shoulder and back pain ( if I were a building , I would be described as `` structurally unsound : - ) ) . I have stretches and exercises to do that help , but the problem never really goes away . If , for whatever reason , I do not exercise for a while ( illness , not enough time , lazy , etc . ) , the muscles become quite stiff and painful and , thus , more prone to further strain . Even with exercise , I sometimes require physical therapy to get back on track , which 1st requires a doctor visit to get the prescription for p.t . The tension in my neck , if not released , eventually causes a headache ( sometimes confused with a sinus headache ) over my left eye . When my physical therapist has massaged my neck , and the sub-occipital muscles in particular ( the 2 knobby areas near the base of the skull ) , the headache usually eased within a day , although it hurts like hell to while it is being massaged . I ordered this device because it seemed to be exactly what I was wishing someone would invent -- a machine that would massage , NOT VIBRATE , my neck and sub-occipital muscles like my physical therapist has done in the past , that I could use by myself . No doctor visit or inconvenient p.t . appts for a week later would be needed to use it . I could get up in the middle of the night and use it , if necessary . I have been using it for about a week or so now , and LOVE it . The base unit is about a 14 '' x 9 '' rectangle , about 3-3/4 '' high , with handles on each side , and it plugs into an average outlet . The two metal `` thumbs '' are about 1-1/2 '' in diameter and protrude about 2-1/2 '' above the base . The thumbs are covered with a gray cloth that is non-removable . They are located more toward one end , rather than centered ( see figure below ) . They move in either clockwise or counter-clockwise directions , depending on which side of the switch is pushed , and are very quiet . It can be used from either side . For instance , the thumbs can be positioned at the base of the neck or the top of the neck , depending on which direction you approach it . _______________________________ | __ _______________ __ | | | | | | | | | | | | | \^^/ \^^/ | | | | | | | | || || | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |_______________| | | | | |__| |__| | |_______________________________| For the neck/head , the user varies the amount of pressure used by ( if laying down ) allowing all or part of the full weight of the head and/or neck to rest on the thumbs . The handles can also be used if sitting or standing , applying pressure with the arms/wrists . Since my wrists are also impaired ( I 'm typing this over an extended period of time ) , and I do n't have someone living with me who can apply it , laying down works well for me . For my back , I sit in a high-backed kitchen chair , position the massager behind me at whatever point I want massaged , and lean back lightly ( or not so lightly ) against it . The pressure of leaning back holds it in place . If I want to massage the entire spine , I simply move it down a few inches whenever I feel like it . For my back , this machine is far superior to use than the commonly used `` home-made '' massager of 2 tennis balls taped together ( with the balls , position ( against a wall or door ) them over the spine and move the body up and down against them ) . The tennis balls are better than nothing , but difficult to use for very long , especially if your quads are not in good shape , and my long hair gets ( painfully ) in the way if I do n't pin it up first . As far as I 'm concerned , the easier something like this is to use , the more likely I 'll use/do it . If there are multiple considerations/hassles , I 'm more likely to not bother with it . Not only has this machine helped with my headaches , but my range of motion for my neck and back are greatly increased . The first time I used it on my neck/sub-occipital muscles , however , I overdid it and pressed too hard against it , which resulted in a very tender , almost bruised area for a few days . I laid off it for about 3 days and applied ice , which helped . After that , I was more gradual about applying pressure . At this point , the pain in the sub-occipital area is now minimal while being massaged . I also learned to use VERY LIGHT pressure on my lower back , which is the most vulnerable point for me . It also eased some painful knots of tension between my shoulder blades , although , again , it took a few days of massaging ( just a few minutes at a time ) to really work it out . I highly recommend this product if you have similar problems , although I can not vouch for its durability ( it seems pretty sturdy ) , since I 've had it such a short time . I plan to use it not only to ease tension , but also to loosen the muscls BEFORE exercising ( and maybe after , too ) . I have been ill recently and not able to exercise much for a few weeks , so this was very timely for me . This is the 1st product I 've ordered from this company and only recently became aware of it thru a co-worker . The catalog states they have been in business since 1976 . It contains quite a few health care products and , while they appear to be more expensive than the average health care catalog products , they also appear to be of much higher quality with more thought put into what they actually do . Definitely a step above some other ones I 've seen such as `` Dr. Leonards Health Care Catalog '' or `` Mature Wisdom '' . I 'm only 37 , but have ended up on some geriatric-type mailing lists ( no big surprise here : - ) ) . I consider many of those products to be rip-offs , particularly targeted toward the elderly , with dubious health benefits . I apologize for the length of this , but it 's the kind of info _I_ would like to know before ordering something thru the mail .

There are several products you might investigate . If you 've got $ 20,000 per seat and high-end hardware , Gain Momentum might be a good choice . It is n't compatible with HyperCard , but has a similar architecture ( and *way* more functionality ) . I do n't have contact information , but they were recently purchased by Sybase who shouldn't be too hard to find . If you 're running News on SPARC , check out HyperLook ( hyperlook @ turing.com ) . It uses Postscript as a scripting language which is good if you need to do lots of display oriented scripting , but not so good for non-programmers . It was $ 995 , last I heard . You might also look at our product MetaCard . We 're alpha-testing direct importing of HyperCard stacks ( we 've even made the test release available for anonymous FTP ) , so we 're obviously the closest in functionality . MetaCard runs on most UNIX workstations and costs $ 495 . Email to info @ metacard.com for more details .

No , as noted , LLNL is involved in lightweight sensor design , per Clementine and related programs . I 'm sure folks around here would like to see a demonstration of a modern inflatable structure , but after all , the U.S. did the Echo satellites long ago , and an advertising structure would not be much closer to an inflatable space station than Echo was ( or a parade balloon , for that matter ) . > > > ... ... ... . > > What do you think of this revolting and hideous attempt to vandalize > > the night sky ?

While I happen to personally dislike the idea , mostly because I 've got a background in astronomy , it 's hardly vandalism -- it would be a short-lived intrusion on the night sky , doing no permanent damage and actually hurting only a small subset of astronomers .

If you write a second time to a CD you need to have multi-session capability to read the second session . Whether it is photos or just data or whatever . Here is a simplified way of looking at it : The first session has the directory structure burned at some tracks . The second session has a newer directory structure , but the first directory still exists , because you can not change , only add . So if you put that in a 'normal' drive and it will only look to the first directory and think it has found all data . Multisession kindof means that the drive will look for the last directory written to the disc , older systems look only for 'the ' directory , not taking multiple directories into account .

You seem to be saying that a LIMITED government will provide MORE opportunities for private interests to use it to pursue their own agendas , and asking libertarians to prove that this will NOT happen . While I ca n't offer such a proof , it seems pretty damn plausible that if the government does not regulate a particular area , it can not become a tool of private interests to pursue their own agendas in that area . I rather suspect that it 's the sort of government we have NOW that is more likely to become such a tool , and that it IS such a tool in many instances . > Just > as Marxism `` fails '' to specify how pure communism is to be achieved and > the state is to `` wither away , '' libertarians frequently fail to show how > weakening the power of the state will result in improvement in the human > condition . I suspect that this is because `` improvement in the human condition '' as you define it is not the primary goal of libertarianism , and would not be the primary goal of a libertarian government . My impression of libertarianism is that its primary goal is the elimination of government coercion except in a very limited cases . -- Ian Sutherland ian @ eecs.nwu.edu Sans Peur

And your excuses fall upon deaf ears when the same BATF has shown shitty leadership despite more people , better weapons , and exclusive use of armor against their targets .

Organization : City University of New York From : < KEVXU @ CUNYVM.BITNET > Subject : Catholic Right & Pat Robertson Lines : 49 The Roman Catholic conservatives are coming out in the open to line up with Pat Robertson and his ultra Right Wing Christian Coalition . Former Secretary of Education William Bennet , a Roman Catholic , stood beside the Christian Coalition 's spokesman Ralph Reed at a March 3 conference in Washington . The purpose of the conference was to publish results of a Christian Coalition poll which was designed to prove that the Republican party would lose major support if it backed away from the `` Family Values '' positons of the '92 convention . Conservative Catholics have swung behind Robertson 's organization with political expertise , legal assistance and high tech communications support . The Catholic Campaign for American , designed as a Catholic version of the Moral Majority , was founded by Marlene Elwell and Tom Wykes . Ms. Elwell has been with Robertson since the days of his Freedom Council in 1985 and worked for him in his presidential bid in 1988 . Ms. Elwell was hired by Domino 's Pizza magnate , Tom Monaghan , in 1989 to manage Legatus , a `` nonpolitical '' , Catholic businessmen 's group . Membership is limited to Catholics who head corporations with a least $ 4 million in annual revenues . Relying on a network of wealthy contacts at Legatus , Elwell and Wykes had little trouble forming and funding the Catholic Campaign . The Campaign 's list of national committee members includes U.S. Rep. Robert K. Dornan , Phyllis Schlafly of the Eagle Forum , the lovely Pat Buchanan and Rev . Richard J. Neuhaus . Also on the national committee is Keith Fournier , a Catholic who heads Pat Robertson's American Center for Law and Justice . Another Catholic , Thomas Patrick Monaghan , senior counsel of Robertson 's ACLJ , is also an active supporter of the Catholic Campaign . The board of directors includes Frank Shakespeare , broadcasting exec and former U.S. ambassador to the Pope , Wall Street executive Frank Lynch , former Reagan official Richard V. Allen , Bishop Rene Gracida of Corpus Christi and Mary Ellen Bork , wife of unsuccessful Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork . In the Winter 1992 issue of _Campaign Update_ the organization's quarterly newsletter , Rocco L. Martino , a Philadelphia business executive wrote : `` Separation of church and state is a false premise that must finally be cast aside and replaced by the true meaning of our constitution . '' Oh yes , the organization 's `` national ecclesisatical advisor '' is Catholic politician Cardinal John J. O'Connor of New York . Jack Carroll

As soon as you possibly can . The difference of a day or two can mean the difference between a short recovery and a long , drawn-out ordeal . GO SEE A DOCTOR . Now , your garden-variety doctor may not necessarily be familiar with this sort of injury . Generally , any hospital with an occupational therapy clinic will offer specialists in these kinds of problems . DO N'T WAIT , THOUGH . GO SEE A DOCTOR . The remainder of this information is paraphrased , without permission , from a wonderful report by New Zealand 's Department of Labour ( Occupational Safety and Health Service ) : `` Occupational Overuse Syndrome . Treatment and Rehabilitation : A Practitioner 's Guide '' . First , a glossary ( or , fancy names for how you should n't have your hands ) : ( note : you 're likely to hear these terms from doctors and keyboard vendors : ) RSI : Repetitive Strain Injury - a general term for many kinds of injuries OOS : Occupational Overuse Syndrome -- synonym for RSI CTD : Cumulative Trauma Disorder -- another synonym for RSI WRULD : Work-Related Upper Limb Disorders -- yet another synonym for RSI CTS : Carpal Tunnel Syndrome ( see below ) Hyperextension : Marked bending at a joint . Pronation : Turning the palm down . Wrist extension : Bending the wrist up . Supination : Turning the palm up . Wrist flexion : Bending the wrist down . Pinch grip : The grip used for a pencil . Ulnar deviation : Bending the wrist towards the little finger . Power grip : The grip used for a hammer . Radial Deviation : Bending the wrist toward the thumb . Abduction : Moving away from the body . Overspanning : Opening the fingers out wide . Now then , problems come in two main types : Local conditions and diffuse conditions . Local problems are what you 'd expect : specific muscles , tendons , tendon sheaths , nerves , etc . being inflamed or otherwise hurt . Diffuse conditions , often mistaken for local problems , can involve muscle discomfort , pain , burning and/or tingling ; with identifiable areas of tenderness in muscles , although they 're not necessarily `` the problem . '' -- - Why does Occupational Overuse Syndrome occur ? Here 's the theory . Normally , your muscles and tendons get blood through capillaries which pass among the muscle fibers . When you tense a muscle , you restrict the blood flow . By the time you 're exerting 50 % of your full power , you 're completely restricting your blood flow . Without fresh blood , your muscles use stored energy until they run out , then they switch to anaerobic ( without oxygen ) metabolism , which generates nasty by-products like lactic acid , which cause pain . Once one muscle hurts , all its neighbors tense up , perhaps to relieve the load . This makes sense for your normal sort of injury , but it only makes things worse with repetitive motion . More tension means less blood flow , and the cycle continues . Another by-product of the lack of blood flow is tingling and numbness from your nerves . They need blood too . Anyway , when you 're typing too much , you 're never really giving a change for the blood to get back where it belongs , because your muscles never relax enough to let the blood through . Stress , poor posture , and poor ergonomics , only make things worse . -- - Specific injuries you may have heard of : ( note : most injuries come in two flavors : acute and chronic . Acute injuries are severely painful and noticable . Chronic conditions have less pronounced symptoms but are every bit as real . ) Tenosynovitis -- an inflamation of the tendon sheath . Chronic tenosynovitis occurs when the repetitive activity is mild or intermittent : not enough to cause acute inflamation , but enough to exceed the tendon sheath 's ability to lubricate the tendon . As a result , the tendon sheath thickens , gets inflamed , and you 've got your problem . Tendonitis -- an inflammation of a tendon . Repeated tensing of a tendon can cause inflamation . Eventually , the fibers of the tendon start separating , and can even break , leaving behind debris which induces more friction , more swelling , and more pain . `` Sub-acute '' tendonitis is more common , which entails a dull ache over the wrist and forearm , some tenderness , and it gets worse with repetitive activity . Carpal Tunnel Syndrome -- the nerves that run through your wrist into your fingers get trapped by the inflamed muscles around them . Symptoms include feeling `` pins and needles '' , tingling , numbness , and even loss of sensation . CTS is often confused for a diffuse condition . Adverse Mechanical Tension -- also known as 'neural tension ' , this is where the nerves running down to your arm have become contracted and possibly compressed as a result of muscle spasms in the shoulders and elsewhere . AMT can often misdiagnosed as or associated with one of the other OOS disorders . It is largely reversible and can be treated with physiotherapy ( brachial plexus stretches and trigger point therapy ) . Others : for just about every part of your body , there 's a fancy name for a way to injure it . By now , you should be getting an idea of how OOS conditions occur and why . Just be careful : many inexperienced doctors misdiagnose problems as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome , when in reality , you may have a completely different problem . Always get a second opinion before somebody does something drastic to you ( like surgery ) . ==4== Typing posture , ergonomics , prevention , treatment The most important element of both prevention and recovery is to reduce tension in the muscles and tendons . This requires learning how to relax . If you 're under a load of stress , this is doubly important . Tune out the world and breath deep and regular . Relaxing should become a guiding principle in your work : every three minutes take a three second break . EVERY THREE MINUTES , TAKE A THREE SECOND BREAK . Really , do it every three minutes . It 's also helpful to work in comfortable surroundings , calm down , and relax . If you ca n't sleep , you really need to focus on this . Rest , sleep , and relaxation are really a big deal . There are all kinds of other treatments , of course . Drugs can reduce inflamation and pain . Custom-molded splints can forcefully prevent bad posture . Surgery can fix some problems . Exercise can help strengthen your muscles . Regular stretching can help prevent injury . Good posture and a good ergonomic workspace promote reduced tension . Ice or hot-cold contrast baths also reduce swelling . Only your doctor can say what 's best for you . -- - Posture -- here are some basic guidelines . [ I so liked the way this was written in the New Zealand book that I 'm lifting it almost verbatim from Appendix 10 . -- dwallach ] . Let your shoulders relax . . Let your elbows swing free . . Keep your wrists straight . . Pull your chin in to look down - do n't flop your head forward . . Keep the hollow in the base of your spine . . Try leaning back in the chair . . Do n't slouch or slump forward . . Alter your posture from time to time . . Every 20 minutes , get up and bend your spine backward . Set the seat height , first . Your feet should be flat on the floor . There should be no undue pressure on the underside of your thighs near the knees , and your thighs should not slope too much . Now , draw yourself up to your desk and see that its height is comfortable to work at . If you are short , this may be impossible . The beest remedy is to raise the seat height and prevent your legs from dangling by using a footrest . Now , adjust the backrest height so that your buttocks fit into the space between the backrest and the seat pan . The backrest should support you in the hollow of your back , so adjust its tilt to give firm support in this area . If you operate a keyboard , you will be able to spend more time leaning back , so experiment with a chair with a taller backrest , if available . [ Now , I diverge a little from the text ] A good chair makes a big difference . If you do n't like your chair , go find a better one . You really want adjustments for height , back angle , back height , and maybe even seat tilt . Most arm rests seem to get in the way , although some more expensive chairs have height adjustable arm rests which you can also rotate out of the way . You should find a good store and play with all these chairs -- pick one that 's right for you . In the San Francisco Bay Area , I highly recommend `` Just Chairs . '' The name says it all . -- - Keyboard drawers , wrist pads , and keyboard replacements : There is a fair amount of controvery on how to get this right . For some people , wrist pads seem to work wonders . However , with good posture , you should n't be resting your wrists on anything -- you would prefer your keyboard to be `` right there '' . If you drop your arms at your side and then lift your hands up at the elbow , you want your keyboard under your hands when your elbows are at about 90 degrees . Of course , you want to avoid pronation , wrist extension , and ulnar deviation at all costs . Wrist pads may or may not help at this . You should get somebody else to come and look at how you work : how you sit , how you type , and how you relax . It's often easier for somebody else to notice your hunched shoulders or deviated hands . Some argue that the normal , flat keyboard is antiquated and poorly designed . A number of replacements are available , on the market , today . Check out the accompanying typing-injury-faq/keyboards for much detail . ==5== Requests for more info Clearly , the above information is incomplete . The typing-injury archive is incomplete . There 's always more information out there . If you 'd like to submit something , please send me mail , and I 'll gladly throw it in . If you 'd like to maintain a list of products or vendors , that would be wonderful ! I 'd love somebody to make a list of chair/desk vendors . I'd love somebody to make a list of doctors . I 'd love somebody to edit the above sections , looking for places where I 've obviously goofed . ==6== References I completely rewrote the information section here , using a wonderful guide produced in New Zealand by their Occupational Safety & Health Service , a service of their Department of Labour .

( Sorry , I did n't say the solution was free . ) In the past I 'd tried everything with my Microsoft serial mouse . ( Cleaning it , unloading all kinds of TSRs , turning off SMARTDRV write cacheing , changing COM ports , ... ) Nothing worked . Yesterday I finally broke down and bought a Mouse Systems Bus Mouse . The improvement is even better than I had imagined ! So much so that my old mouse must have been jumpy all the time ( I just thought it was jumpy sometimes ) , and I had gotten so used to it I did n't notice . My wife , who uses the computer about once a month , noticed the improvement literally within a second ! I ca n't say anything about other bus mice , but with the Mouse Systems one you 'll have to give up either COM2 or LPT2 to an IRQ . Also , if you do n't know , Mouse Systems mice have three buttons . The driver includes a utility that lets you assign keystrokes to the middle button . Hope this helps someone else .

Ave. , Cambridge , MA 02139 , USA +1 ( 617 ) 876-3296 Lines : 227 NNTP-Posting-Host : life.ai.mit.edu THE WHITE HOUSE Office of the Press Secretary ______________________________________________________________ For Immediate Release April 15 , 1993 REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT TO LAW ENFORCEMENT ORGANIZATIONS The Rose Garden 2:52 P.M. EDT THE PRESIDENT : Good afternoon . Ladies and gentlemen , two months ago I presented a comprehensive plan to reduce our national deficit and to increase our investment in the American people , their jobs and their economic future . The federal budget plan passed Congress in record time , and created a new sense of hope and opportunity in the country . Then , the short-term jobs plan I presented to Congress , which would create a half a million jobs in the next two years passed the House of Representatives two weeks ago . It now has the support of a majority of the United States Senate . All of these members of Congress know it 's time to get the economy moving again , to get job growth going again , to get a fast start on the investments we need to build a lasting prosperity . Unfortunately , a minority of the members of the United States Senate have used gridlock tactics to prevent their colleagues from working the will of the majority on the jobs bill . When Congress returns , I ask every senator from every state and from both parties to remember what is at stake . The issue is not politics , it 's people . Sixteen million of them are looking for full-time jobs and ca n't find them . These men and women do n't care about who 's up or down in Washington . They care about paying the rent and meeting the mortgage payment , about putting food on the table and buying shoes for their children , about regaining a sense of dignity that comes from doing a day 's work and supporting their families and drawing a paycheck . They 're asking those of us who have the privilege of serving to put aside politics and do something now to move our economy forward . I am prepared to do that . And I have been working with the Senate to come up with an adjusted package that meets some of the concerns of those who have been blocking action on the jobs plan . I 'm willing to compromise , so long as we keep the focus on jobs , keep the focus on growth and keep the focus on meeting unmet national needs . Our opponents have been asking for a smaller package . Today I ask them to join me in determining exactly what kind and what size package Congress can approve that actually meets the needs of the American people . But even as we make those reductions and the package will be smaller , I believe we must address problems that are on the minds of millions of Americans , and one in particular , and that is the need to toughen law enforcement in our society to deal with the dramatic rise in violent crime . So I will ask , even in this reduced package , for an additional $ 200 million in federal funding to help local communities to rehire police officers who have been laid off because of the fiscal problems caused by the national recession . Together , with a matching effort by local governments , this could put as many as 10,000 police officers back on the job , and back on the beat in communities all across our nation . At a time when too many of our people live in fear of violent crime , when too many businesses have closed and too many people have lost their jobs because people are afraid to leave their homes , rehiring thousands of officers is one of the best investments America can make . And I ask both Houses of Congress to make that investment in our people 's safety and in their piece of mind . I believe in the need for strong federal action to keep the economy going toward recovery and to create jobs . Make no mistake about it : I will fight for these priorities as hard as I ever have . I will never forget that the people sent me here to fight for their jobs , their future and for fundamental change . I want to thank the police officers who are here today and tell you that not a single one of them knew before they came here that I had determined to ask for more money in this jobs bill to rehire police officers . They came here because they believe in the summer jobs portion of the package . And I want them to be free to talk about that . They came here not out of any law enforcement concern other than the fact that they wanted the kids in this country to have a chance to have jobs this summer , to have safer streets and a brighter and more peaceful future . I say what I say today not just because it 's good for law enforcement but because it 's good for the people who live in these communities . I have always supported community policing not only because it helps to prevent crime and to lower the crime rate , but because it cements better relationships between people in law enforcement and the people that they 're hired to protect . It reduces the chances of abusive action by police officers and increases the chances of harmony and safe streets at the same time . These are the kinds of things that we are trying to do . I promised in my campaign that I 'd do everything I could to put another 100,000 police officers on the street over the next four years . This makes a good downpayment on that . This keeps in mind the core of the jobs package . And this will help us to move forward . So I ask the people in the Senate who have blocked the jobs bill , let 's work together . I can accept a reduced package if you will increase your commitment to safe streets . I do not accept the fact that we should reduce our commitment to summer jobs or to building our infrastructure or to doing those other things that will create real and lasting prosperity for our people . I have done my part now to end the gridlock ; I ask you to do yours . I want now to give the people who are here with me on the platform a chance to make some remarks and to be heard by the American people -- beginning with Janet Reno , the distinguished Attorney General . * * * * * * * * * * * * Q Mr. President , can you tell us -- do you think that the jobs package could be put in further jeopardy by controversy over the suggestion of a VAT tax at this point in the congressional dialogue ? THE PRESIDENT : Not at all . I think it should have -- they would n't have any relationship one to the other . First of all , I made absolutely no decision on that . You should know that there 's a lot of support in the business community and the labor community -- people have asked us to consider that because of the enormous burden of the present system on many of our major employers , particularly many of those that we depend upon to generate jobs and to carry the strength of this economy . But I have made absolutely no decision that would even approach that on that or any other kind of general tax . Q Do you personally believe that the American public is ready to pay for -- to have another tax to pay for health care ? I mean , apart from what business and labor leaders have said -- THE PRESIDENT : I 'm not going to speculate on that . I will say this : The real issue is how quickly we can recycle the benefits of all the savings to cover the cost . I mean , that is -- everyone knows that if you do what we 're proposing to do , if you streamline the insurance system , if you fix the system so that there 's no longer an enormous economic incentive to over-utilize or over-provide certain services , if you provide primary and preventive care in places where it is n't now , every single analysis shows absolutely massive savings to the health care system . The real question is whether you can transfer those savings to cover those who have no coverage now or those who have virtually no coverage so that you provide people the security . I have no idea . The polls say that , but I do n't know . All I know is the polls that I see in the press that many of you have commissioned , they say overwhelmingly the American people want the security of an affordable health care system . But I do n't think that has anything to do with this stimulus , and it certainly should n't have . People want a job first and foremost . They want that more than anything else . Q Now that you 've announced your willingness to compromise on the stimulus package , can you tell us what parts of your package you consider vital and uncompromisable ? I assume summer jobs is one . THE PRESIDENT : I want the summer jobs ; I want the highway program and I want the police program . I still intend -- let me say this : I still intend to fully and aggressively push the crime bill , which did not pass the Congress last year . This is a supplement to that , not a substitute for it in any way . But I think we need to do that . I think we need the Ryan White funds because of the enormous health care burdens to the communities that are inordinately and disproportionately affected by the problems of caring for people with AIDS . And there are several other things that I think should be done . We have to do the Agriculture Department meat inspectors ; the safety of the public depends on that . There are a number of other things that I do n't -- I do n't think any of it should be cut , but I have given Senator Mitchell and Senator Byrd -- I talked to them . And Senator Dole called me yesterday to discuss this , and I told him that I would call him back . I called him back last night in New Hampshire and we discussed this . And I basically asked them to talk today , and said that I would not make any statements about any specifics until at least they had a chance to talk to see whether or not they could reach some accord . So I do n't want to be any more specific than I have been already , and let 's see if they can talk it out . Q When you talked to Senator Dole and Senator Mitchell did you tell them about your -- increase also , that $ 200 million , that you want that as part of the package ? THE PRESIDENT : I did -- I told Senator -- I left word for Senator Mitchell last night about it . When I talked to Senator Dole -- I do n't remember for sure -- I do not believe I mentioned it . But I did tell him that I was prepared to reduce the package and I wanted to break the gridlock , and I told him that I was working on a reformulation of it so that -- in the hope that it would become even more focused on jobs and the kinds of issues that I thought the American people wanted us to address . And this is certainly consistent with that . Thank you . END3:12 P.M. EDT

A set of rules is a moral code or a > law code or an algorithm for acting . Such things can be very helpful > to individuals or societies -- but not if they are used *instead* of a > personal involvement in and responsibility for one 's actions . ... The two commandments *are* rules ; they are merely rules that are so vague that they are practically devoid of meaning . Michael Siemon acknowledges this every time he writes that the resolution of an argument over them turns on secular and cultural assumptions that are independent of these rules . > ... The Great Commandment is , more than anything else , a call > to act *as if you were God and accepting ultimate responsibility* > in your every action . ... The commandment to love your neighbor as yourself can be viewed , in part , as reminding man that he is not God and can not act as if he has `` ultimate responsibility . '' Indeed , many traditions present an interpretation where believers are supposed to interpret loving one 's neighbor as following various other rules , and relying on their god to make things come out right , precisely because it would be wrong for man to assume such `` ultimate responsibility . '' Once again , we are confronted with good sounding goo that means whatever the reader wants it to mean . > ... `` Conservatives '' may twist this `` act as if you were God '' to > mean `` lay down rules for other people and be as nasty to them > as possible if they do n't keep YOUR rules . '' They are so > insistent ( and obvious ) about this that they have convinced a > lot of people ( who rightly reject the whole concept ! ) that such > idiocy IS how God acts . ... And who is to say that this interpretation is `` twisted '' ? There are many passages in the Bible that in their most straightforward reading show the Christian god behaving in just this way . Michael can not refer to `` base '' claims or base commandments to show that such readings are `` twisted , '' because this divergence in understanding occurs even in trying to interpret the `` base '' claims and commandments . In addressing conservative Christians , Michael will necessarily draw upon secular and cultural notions that these conservative Christians will reject . > But why should anyone BE looking for an ethical system , since our > society is eager to hand us one or more no matter what we do ? It > may be that we need a principle for the CRITIQUE of ethical systems > -- in which case I will profer the _agapate allelou_ once again . But these base commandments are too vague to serve as `` a principle for the CRITIQUE of ethical systems . '' The meaning of these base commandments for any believer derives from the secular and cultural notions that the believer brings to them , from how the believer mixes their demands with straightforward readings of other Biblical passages , from a particular sectarian tradition , or from some combination of these things . These commandments lack sufficient substance in themself to serve as a basis for criticizing ethical systems . What meaning they have comes from the ethical system the believer brings to these commandments . > And different bodies of Christians have , from the beginning , urged > *different* `` ethical systems '' ( or in some cases , none ) . As a result , > it is bizarre to identify any one of these systems , however popular > ( or infamous ) with Christianity . Christianity DOES NOT HAVE A TORAH . > It does not have a QU'RAN . Specifically Christian scripture has very > little , if anything , in the way of `` commandments '' -- so little that > the `` Christians '' who desperately *want* commandments go `` mining '' for > them with almost no support ... The one , single , thing in the gospels > which Jesus specifically `` gives '' as `` a commandment '' to us is `` love > one another . '' Jesus explicitly states that this summarizes Jewish law , which would seem to bring in all of it if we properly understand what it means to love God and love our neighbors . There are *many* parables and teachings the gospels attribute to Jesus that are straightforwardly read as ethical commandments . The Pauline epistles are similarly full . If it is not clear that these all come together in a sensible understanding of ethical behavior , the problem is *not* a lack of raw material . -* -- -- > I am a `` radical '' Christian *only* in that I take the gospel seriously . No , Michael , the conservative Christians also take the gospel seriously . What differentiates you is the way you interpret the gospel . > ... Why do n't I and the ( myriads of ) other Christians like me > tell you something about Christianity ? ... In a sense , the wide variety of interpretations does tell us something about Christianity . It tells us that the New Testament authors left a sufficiently vague hodge-podge that it can serve as the source text for many , vastly different beliefs about the nature of the Christian god and about what men should and should n't do . The irony here is that there is *nothing* in Christianity per se that Michael can use to support the cause of lesbians and gays . *Every* Christian principle he turns to this cause is effective only through the extra-Christian principles through which Michael interprets his religion , and the homophobes apply the *same* Christian principles , with equal justification , to their cause . In short , it is the extra-Christian principles that make Michael 's Christianity beneficial , and I suspect they would be as beneficial , perhaps moreso , without being filtered by Christian interpretation . Michael paints a picture of `` standard American atheism '' as the rejection of the evil in many conservative Christian interpretations of the Bible . But I think it is even more damaging to Christianity to note that the New Testament presents such a vague hodge-podge of notions about the nature of God and the nature of the good ( except , of course , when it is ordered by an interpretation that relies on extraneous principles ) . Here , I think we should apply a Christian parable , where a cold drink can have its value and a hot drink can have its value , but the lukewarm we should spit out . Russell

Well , in that case , the cones are indeed > color sensitive , contrary to what the original respondent had claimed . I 'm not sure who the `` original respondent '' was but to reiterate cones respond to particular portions of the spectrum , just as _rods_ respond to certain parts of the visible spectrum ( bluegreen in our case , reddish in certain amphibia ) , just as the hoseshoe crab _Limulus polyphemus_ photoreceptors respond to a certain portion of the spectrum etc . It is a common misconception to confound wavelength specificity with being color sensitive , however the two are not synonymous . So in sum and to beat a dead horse : ( 1 ) When the outputs of a cone are matched for number of absorbed photons _irrespective_ of the absorbed photons wavelength , the cone outputs are _indistinguishable_ . ( 2 ) Cones are simply detectors with different spectral sensitivities and are not any more `` color sensitive '' than are rods , ommatidia or other photoreceptors . ( 3 ) Color vision arises because outputs of receptors which sample different parts of the spectrum ( cones in this case ) are '' processed centrally '' . ( The handwave is intentional ) I 've worked and published research on rods and cones for over 10 years so the adherence to the belief that cones can `` detect color '' is frustrating . But do n't take my word for it . I 'm reposting a few excellent articles together with two rather good but oldish color vision texts .

Yeesh , you WILL be nailing those IRLEDs . May I suggest getting your mitts on the Siemens SFH484-2 IRLED ? This unit is designed to take some big current pulses if you can get your duty cycle down a bit . It will output nearly a watt ( 975 mW ) with REAL short duty cycle times . ( nice thing about the SFH484-2 is that it is CHEAP . I got mine for about 50 cents a piece , even though I had to buy 100 of them ... . ) BTW , I have seen IRLEDs with outputs up to 6 watts ... honest , 6 WATTS . I do n't have the book here at work so I ca n't recall the company name . The 6 watter ai n't cheap , around $ 108 but if you want some power , mamamia , that 's pretty hot . They also have a 4 watt , a 2 watt and a 1 watt device in their line , and will sell small quan . to individuals . If you are interested , I can find the book at home and get the pertinent info . Now , as for the position detector , you might try ELTEC in Florida . Phone number listed in the 92/93 ETID is 904-253-5328 . They seem like nice people . Their specialty is passive infrared detection devices , so they might be able to help you out . I 'm curious about your applications if you do n't mind saying . The device sounds like it could be useful in a lasertag game , although you'd need to up your carrier signal concept to 58.8 KHz ... ... Duane

Unfortunately your phrasing is ambiguous . Re-writing more carefully , we have ( at least ) two possibilities . The first : Things called `` Mercedes '' are cars That girl is called `` Mercedes '' Therefore that girl is a car That is entirely valid as a piece of logical deduction . It is not sound , because the first statement is false . Similarly , I would hold that Jim's example is valid but not sound .

Does having a ground plane > in an analog system help reduce noise also ? My system only deals with > low frequency signals ( up to 100Hz only ! ! ! ) . Well , one reason for getting conflicting answers is that it depends on what you want the ground plane to do . A continuous conductor is a good electrostatic shield . Do you have signals on your board that need shielding rom other things ? This shielding wo n't do much good for magnetic fields , unless you make it continuous around the circuit to be shielded , like a Faraday cage . The flip side of the coin : if you are working with ( very ) high impedances , you could end up with capacitances to the gound plane that cause problems . You are n't likely to encounter this at 100Hz , but at 20kHz , it can be a real problem ( one that bit me once ) .

I think that you should try to find more sources of news about what goes on in Lebanon and try to see through the propaganda .

That you have seen no evidence that there IS a God is correct - neither have I . But lack of evidence for the existence of something is in NO WAY evidence for the non-existence of something ( the creationist have a similar mode of argumentation in which if they disprove evolution the establish creation ) . You ( personally ) have never seen a neutrino before , but they exist . The `` pink unicorn '' analogy breaks down and is rather naive . I have a scientific theory that explains the appearance of animal life - evolution . When I draw the conclusion that '' pink unicorns '' do n't exist because I have n't seen them , this conclusion has it 's foundation in observation and theory . A `` pink unicorn '' , if it did exist , would be qualitatively similar to other known entities . That is to say , since there is good evidence that all life on earth has evolved from `` more primitive '' ancestors these pink unicorns would share a common anscestory with horses and zebras and such .

I am arguing one , and only one , thing - that to make a positive assertion about something for which there can in principle be no evidence for or against requires a leap - it requires faith . I am , as you would say , a '' theist '' ; however , there is a form of atheism that I can respect - but it must be founded upon honesty . > Benedikt -- bob singleton bobs @ thnext.mit.edu

Subject : Remarks by President Clinton to NCAA Division I Champion Hockey Team From : `` nigel allen '' < nigel.allen @ canrem.com > Reply-To : `` nigel allen '' < nigel.allen @ canrem.com > Distribution : rec Organization : Canada Remote Systems Lines : 158 Here is a press release from the White House . Remarks by President Clinton to NCAA Division I Champion Hockey Team April 19 ; Q & A Following To : National Desk Contact : White House Office of the Press Secretary , 202-456-2100 WASHINGTON , April 19 -- Following is a transcript of remarks by President Clinton to the University of Maine `` Black Bears '' NCAA Division I hockey champions : The Rose Garden 9:58 A.M. EDT THE PRESIDENT : Good morning ladies and gentlemen . It's an honor for me to welcome the University of Maine Black Bears , the winner of the NCAA Division I hockey national championship to the Rose Garden and the White House . I understand from Senator Mitchell that this is the first team from the University of Maine every to win a national championship . And we 're glad to have them here . I 'm inspired not only by how the team pulled together to win the championship , but how the entire state pulled together to cheer them onto victory . Coming from a state that is also relatively small in size , but also filled with pride and tradition and community , I can understand how the people of Maine must feel about the Black Bears . In our state people are still talking about the time we won the Orange Bowl over the number one ranked football team , and that was back in 1978 . I 'm sure that 15 years from now , the people of Maine will as proud of this team as they are today . You know , in my state football is a slightly more popular sport than hockey . We do n't have a lot of ice . ( Laughter . ) But after spending three months getting banged around in this town , I can understand a little more about hockey than I did before I came here . Hockey is a tough game . It 's a hard-hitting sport . It does have one virtue though , there 's a penalty for delay of game . I wish we had that rule in the Senate . ( Laughter . ) In government as in hockey , leadership is important . In the United States Senate , our team has a great captain , the Majority Leader and the senior Senator from Maine , George Mitchell ; junior Senator -- Cohen looks so young , I ca n't imagine . ( Laughter . ) I'm actually bitter about Senator Cohen because he looks so much younger than me . On your hockey team , the captain Jim Montgomery has done a great job . He scored the winning goal late in the championship game , leading you to a come-from-behind victory -- something else I know a little bit about . Sport brings out the best in individuals and in teams and in communities . I share the pride that Senator Mitchell and Senator Cohen and Congressman Andrews and all the people of Maine must feel for the Black Bears who have shown us all how to play as a team , how to bring out the best in one another , and how to come from behind . I think it 's important , as I ask young people from around America who have achieved outstanding things in working together , to come here to the White House to be recognized and appreciated by their country , to remember that those kinds of values and those kinds of virtues need to be ingrained in all of us for all of our lives . We now have another role model , and I 'm glad to have them here today . ( Applause . ) ( The President is presented with team jersey . ) ( Applause . ) THE PRESIDENT : That 's great . I love it . It 's beautiful . ( Applause . ) ( The President is presented with an autographed stick . ) THE PRESIDENT : Thank you . That 's great . ( Applause . ) * * * * * * Q Mr. President , did you authorize the move on Waco this morning , sir ? THE PRESIDENT : I was aware of it . I think the Attorney General made the decision . And I think I should refer all questions to her and to the FBI . Q Did you have any instructions for her as to how it should be executed ? THE PRESIDENT : No , they made the tactical decisions . That was their judgment , the FBI . Q Is this a raid ? THE PRESIDENT : And I will -- I want to refer you to -- talk to the Attorney General and the FBI . I knew it was going to be done , but the decisions were entirely theirs , all the tactical decisions . Q What did you and Senator Mitchell talk about this morning ? Q Any chance for that stimulus package ? THE PRESIDENT : Senator Mitchell ought to pay my quarter . ( Laughter . ) I was in there -- ( laughter ) . SENATOR MITCHELL : You have to pay that quarter . THE PRESIDENT : I was ready . ( Laughter . ) Senator Mitchell , he 's worth a quarter any day . Q Any chance for your bill , sir ? THE PRESIDENT : We talked about what was going to happen this week in the Senate and about what other meetings we 're going to have for the rest of the week . We only had about five minutes to talk . And we agreed we 'd get back together later , around noon , and talk some more . Q Senator Dole said over the weekend that your compromise is no compromise . THE PRESIDENT : Well , I know he did , but , look , Senator Dole and a lot of the other Republicans now in the Senate voted for the same kind of thing for Ronald Reagan in 1983 ; and our research indicates that a majority of them over time voted for a total of 28 emergency spending measures totalling over $ 100 billion when Reagan and Bush were President , in those administrations . And many of those purposes were not nearly as worthy as putting the American people back to work . I do n't want to go back and revisit every one , but you can do it . You can look at the research there . So this position they 're taking is not credible . We have a very tough five-year deficit reduction plan . All these costs are covered during that time and then some . And the very people that are saying this has all got to be paid for do n't have much of a history on which to base their position . They 've got 12 years of vote for stimulus measures of this kind that had very little to with putting the American people back to work . So I think we 've got a chance to work it out , and I 'm hopeful . We 'll see what happens today and tomorrow . I 'm feeling pretty good about it . THE PRESS : Thank you END 10:10 A.M.

It is much easier to be an element of change Hardly . The `` established '' situation existed prior to Smythe , et al . The Stanley Cup was a challenge trophy up for grabs to whatever team could successfully mount the challenge . What our dear founders did was formalize the challenge . They created a closed league , an oligop- olistic professional system , in the interests of making money . Wheth- er or not that system has contributed to better hockey is certainly debatable . We are , however , stuck with their invention and that de- bate is academic . The point to be made , however , is that people played hockey and people enjoyed watching hockey long before Smythe and his pals showed up . > or a standout in an existing situation than it is to be someone who creates > a new situation . If you want to honor players like Bobby Orr than I 'm sure > you can find a reason to name a torphy after him such as best offensive > defenseman . What 's wrong with best defenceman , period ?

Sorry about the misinformation . I made a bad assumption about the new machines behaving like a Quadra 900 , see previous post . About sampling the CD audio though , have you tried it ? I found the aliasing to be really bad . Like it needed a filter or something . Much worse than I expected . I installed the CD-300 in the Quadra myself so maybe I missed something . Everything else works great though .

Funnily , the previous hidden wholesale tax that it replaces was never referred to as a tax ( or , people never paid mind to it , thus the uproar when it was brought up front as the GST -- - one party has actually campaigned on hiding the tax again ) . The stated intent of the Tories was to use the GST to write down our deficit . Unfortunately , their legislation did n't include any mechanism for disbursing the collected funds in such a manner and the money is now sitting in escrow . I do n't know what is involved in releasing the funds , but one dilemna is that the Tories are not fiscal conservatives themselves though while taxing and spending , they 've made moves to apply the breaks to a runaway locomotive by the end of this time -- - the end of their second term ( ~9 years ) . While they do have chances of getting a third term , catching up in the polls to their more moderate/slightly leftish pro-business rivals , the Liberals ( as in Euro/UK ) , the Tories ' heir-apparent for the leaders ' mantle has been termed a clone of Hillary Clinton ... gld -- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Je me souviens ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Gary L.

There > is a book `` The Yeast Connection '' which talks about this `` illness '' . > > There is no convincing evidence that such a disease exists . There 's a lot of evidence , it just has n't been adequately gathered and published in a way that will convince the die-hard melancholic skeptics who quiver everytime the word 'anecdote ' or 'empirical ' is used . For example , Dr. Ivker , who wrote the book `` Sinus Survival '' , always gives , before any other treatment , a systemic anti-fungal ( such as Nizoral ) to his new patients IF they 've been on braod-spectrum anti-biotics 4 or more times in the last two years . He 's kept a record of the results , and for over 2000 patients found that over 90 % of his patients get significant relief of allergic/sinus symptoms . Of course , this is only the beginning for his program . In my case , as I reported a few weeks ago , I was developing the classic symptoms outlined in 'The Yeast Connection ' ( I agree it is a poorly written book ) : e.g. , extreme sensitivity to plastics , vapors , etc . which I never had before ( started in November ) . Within one week of full dosage of Sporanox , the sensitivity to chemicals has fully disappeared - I can now sit on my couch at home without dying after two minutes . I 'm also *greatly* improved in other areas as well . Of course , I have allergy symptoms , etc . I am especially allergic to molds , yeasts , etc . It does n't take a rocket scientist to figure out that if one has excessive colonization of yeast in the body , and you have a natural allergy to yeasts , that a threshold would be reached where you would have perceptible symptoms . Also , yeast do produce toxins of various sorts , and again , you do n't have to be a rocket scientist to realize that such toxins can cause problems in some people . In my case it was sinus since that 's the center of my allergic response . Of course , the $ 60,000 question is whether a person who is immune compromised ( as tests showed I was from over 5 years of antibiotics , nutritionally-deficiencies because of the stress of infections and allergies , etc . ) , can develop excessive yeast colonization somewhere in the body . It is a tough question to answer since testing for excessive yeast colonization is not easy . One almost has to take an empirical approach to diagnosis . Fortunately , Sporanox is relatively safe unlike past anti-fungals ( still have to be careful , however ) so there's no reason any longer to withhold Sporanox treatment for empirical reasons . BTW , some would say to try Nystatin . Unfortunately , most yeast grows hyphae too deep into tissue for Nystatin to have any permanent affect . You 'll find a lot of people who are on Nystatin all the time . In summary , I appreciate all of the attempts by those who desire to keep medicine on the right road . But methinks that some who hold too firmly to the party line are academics who have n't been in the trenches long enough actually treating patients . If anybody , doctors included , said to me to my face that there is no evidence of the 'yeast connection ' , I can not guarantee their safety .

From : muirm @ argon.gas.organpipe.uug.arizona.edu ( maxwell c muir ) Subject : Re : Homosexuality issues in Christianity Organization : University of Arizona , Tucson Lines : 75 Can someone cite Biblical references to homosexuality being immoral , other than Leviticus ? So far , when I ask , around here , I get the verses from Leviticus spouted at me , but the whole rest of that book tends to be ignored by Christians ( have n't seen any stonings in a _long_ time : - ) . Later , Max ( Bob ) Muir [ The list was posted not long ago , as I recall , aside from Lev , commonly cited passages are : the story of Sodom . Note however that this was a homosexual rape , and there 's no disagreement that that is wrong . I take an intermediate position on this : note that Sodom is referred to elsewhere in the Bible for its sinfulness . It does n't seem to have been known specifically for homosexuality . Rather , I think it was considered a cesspool of all sins . However from what we know of Jewish attitudes , homosexuality would have contributed to the horror of the action described . ( It almost seems to have been contrived to combine about as many forms of evil in one act as possible : homosexual rape of guests , who were actually angels . ) But this story is not specifically about homosexuality . In the NT , the clear references are all from Paul 's letters . In Rom 1 , there is a passage that presupposes that homosexuality is an evil . Note that the passage is n't about homosexuality -- it 's about idolatry . Homosexuality is visited on people as a punishment , or at least result , of idolatry . There are a number of arguments over this passage . It does not use the word `` homosexuality '' , and it is referring to people who are by nature heterosexual practicing homosexuality . So it 's not what I 'd call an explicit teaching against all homosexuality . But it does seem to support what would be a natural assumption anyway , that Paul shares the general negative Jewish attitude towards homosexuality . The other passages occur in lists of sins , in I Cor 6:9 , and I Tim 1:10 . Unfortunately it 's not entirely clear what the words used here mean . There have been suggestions that one has a broader meaning , such as `` wanton '' , and that another may be specifically `` male prostitute '' . Again , we do n't have here a precise teaching about homosexuality , but it is at least weak supportive evidence that Paul shared the OT 's negative judgement on homosexuality . Jude 1:7 is sometimes cited , however it 's probably not relevant . The context in Jude involves angels . Since those who were almost raped in Sodom were angels , it seems likely that `` strange flesh '' refers to intercourse with angels . As you can see , the NT evidence is such that people 's conclusion is determined by their approach to the Bible . Conservatives note that the passages from Paul 's letters imply that he accepted the OT prohibition . This is enough for them to regard it as having NT endorsement . Liberals note that there 's no specific teaching , and no clear definition of what is being prohibited or why ( is the concern in Rom 1 the connection of homosexuality to pagan worship ? what exactly do the words in the lists of sins mean ? ) . Thus some believe it is legitimate to regard this as a attitude Paul took with him from his background and not a specific teaching of the Gospel . This is an explosive topic , which tends to result in long dissertations on the exact meaning of various Greek words . But it's clear to me that that 's mostly irrelevant . What it really comes down to is whether people are looking to the Bible for law or whether they believe that such as approach is inconsistent with the Gospel . This appears to depend upon one 's reaction to the message of the Bible as a whole , as well as one 's perception of the needs of the church today . This is a difference of approach at least as serious as the difference between Protestant and Catholic in the 16th Cent , and one where both sides believe that the Bible is so obviously on their side that they keep thinking all they have to do is quote a few more passages and the other side will finally come to their senses . That makes things very frustrating for a moderator , who realizes that such an optimistic outcome is not very likely ... -- clh ]

From : eder @ hsvaic.boeing.com ( Dani Eder ) Subject : Re : Guns for Space Keywords : Sopa Gun , Space Launcer Organization : Boeing AI Center , Huntsville , AL Lines : 72 Okay , lets get the record straight on the Livermore gas gun . The project manager is Dr. John Hunter , and he works for the Laser group at Livermore . What , you may ask , does gas guns have to do with lasers ? Nothing , really , but the gun is physically located across the road from the Free Electron Laser building , and the FEL building has a heavily shielded control room ( thick walls ) from which the gun firings are controlled . So I suspect that the office he works for is an administrative convenience . I visited Hunter at the beginning of Feb. and we toured the gun . At the time I was working on gas gun R & D at Boeing , where I work , but I am now doing other things ( helping to save the space station ) , The gun uses a methane-air mixture , which is burned in a chamber about 200 ft long by 16 inch ID ( i.e . it looks like a pipe ) . The chamber holds a 1 ton piston which is propelled at several hundred m/s down the chamber . On the other side of the piston is hudrogen gas , initially at room temperature andsome tens of atmospheres . The piston compresses and heats the hydrogen ahead of it until a stainless steel burst diaphragm ruptures , at around 50,000 psi . The barrel of the gun is about 100 feet long and has a 4 inch bore . It is mounted at right angles to the chamber ( i.e . they intersect ) . This was done so that in the future , the barrel could be raised and the gun fired into the air without having to move the larger and heavier chamber . The projectile being used in testing is a 5 kg cylinder of Lexan plastic , 4 in in diameter and about 50 cm long . All of the acceleration comes from the expansion of the hydrogen gas from 50,000 psi downwards until the projectile leaves the barrel . The barrel is evacuated , and the end is sealed with a sheet of plastic film ( a little thicker than Saran wrap ) . The plastic is blown off by the small amount of residual air trapped in the barrel ahead of the projectile . The gun is fired into a bunker filled with sandbags and plastic water jugs . In the early testing fragments of the plastic projectile were found . At the higher speeds in later testing , the projectile vaporizes . The testing is into a bunker because the Livermore test range is about 3 miles across , and the projectile would go 100-200 km if fired for maximum range . The intent is to move the whole gun to Vandenberg AFB after the testing is complete , where they can fire into the Pacific Ocean , and use the tracking radar at VAFB to follow the projectiles . The design goal of the gun is to throw a 5 kg projectile at 4 km/s ( half of orbital speed ) . So far they have reached 2 km/s , and the gun is currently down for repairs , as on the last test they blew a seal and damaged some of the hardware ( I think it had to do with the methane-air more detonating than burning , but I have n't had a chance to talk to Hunter directly on this ) . There are people waiting to test scramjet components in this gun by firing then out of the gun into the air ( at Mach 12= 4 km/s ) , since the most you can get in wind tunnels is Mach 8 . This gun cost about 4 million to develop , and is basically a proof-of-concept for a bigger gun capable of firing useful- sized payloads into space . This would require on the order of 100 kg projectiles , which deliver on the order of 20 kg useful payload to orbit .

From LA Times , Friday , April 9 , 1993 . P. A1 . EVIDENCE OF ADL SPY OPERATION SEIZED BY POLICE By Richard C. Paddock , Times staff writer SAN FRANCISCO -- Police on Thursday served search warrants on the Anti-Defamation League here and in Los Angeles , seizing evidence of a nationwide intelligence network accused of keeping files on more than 950 political groups , newspapers and labor unions and as many as 12,000 people . Describing the spy operation in great detail , San Francisco authorities simultaneously released voluminous documents telling how operatives of the Anti-Defamation League searched through trash and infiltrated organizations to gather intelligence on Arab-American , right-wing and what they called `` pinko '' organizations . Representatives of the Anti-Defamation League , a well-known organization in the U.S. Jewish community dedicated to fighting anti-Semitism , declined detailed comment Thursday but denied breaking any laws . Police allege that the organization maintains undercover operatives to gather political intelligence in at least seven cities , including Los Angeles and San Francisco . Groups that were the focus of the spy operation span the political spectrum , including such groups as the Ku Klux Klan , the White Aryan Resistance , Operation Rescue , Greenpeace , the National Assn . for the Advancement of Colored People , the United Farm Workers and the Jewish Defense League . Also on the list were Mills College , the board of directors of San Francisco public television station KQED and the San Francisco Bay Guardian newspaper . People who were subjects of the spy operation included former Republican Rep. Pete McCloskey , jailed political extremist Lyndon H. LaRouche and Los Angeles Times foreign correspondent Scott Kraft , who is based in South Africa . Authorities said much of the material collected by the groups was confidential information obtained illegally from law enforcement agencies . They also alleged that data on some individuals and organizations was sold separately to the South African government . In addition to allegations of obtaining confidential information from police , the Anti-Defamation League could face a total of 48 felony counts for not properly reporting the employment of its chief West Coast spy , Roy Bullock , according to the affidavit filed to justify the search warrant . The Anti-Defamation League disguised payments to Bullock for more than 25 years by funneling $ 550 a week to Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I. Hochman , who then paid Bullock , according to the documents released in San Francisco . Hochman , a former president of the Jewish Federation Council of Greater Los Angeles and one of the state 's leading tax attorneys , will be out of the city until late next week and could not be reached for comment , his office said . Until 1990 , Hochman , a former U.S. prosecutor , also was a member of a panel appointed by then-Sen. Pete Wilson to secretly make initial recommendations on new federal judges in California . Hochman is a former regional president of the Anti-Defamation League . The league , which initially cooperated with police , has denied repeatedly that its intelligence-gathering operation broke any laws . League officials will not confirm or deny whether Bullock was an employee and have said they simply traded information with police departments about people who might be involved in hate crimes . But in an affidavit filed to obtain warrants for Thursday 's searches , San Francisco police alleged that `` ADL employees were apparently less than truthful '' in providing information during an earlier search conducted without a warrant . David Lehrer , executive director of the Los Angeles ADL office , said the organization has not violated the law . `` There is nothing nefarious about how we operate or what we have done , '' he said . `` Our record speaks for itself . '' The police affidavit contends that Lehrer had sole control of a secret fund used to pay for `` fact-finding operations . '' Lehrer , according to the documents , signed checks from the account under the name L. Patterson . An ADL official said the account was used to pay for subscriptions to a wide variety of extremist publications that might balk at sending them directly to the Anti-Defamation League . Bullock , 58 , who has been collecting intelligence for the ADL for nearly 40 years , defended his efforts during a lengthy interview with San Francisco police . He said that he gathered names from many sources and entered them into his computer under headings such as `` Skins '' and `` Pinkos , '' but that did not necessarily mean that they were under surveillance . `` I might never see or call up on 99 % of them again , '' Bullock said . `` And it does n't mean anything that they 're in the files . It 's not a threat to anyone 's civil rights that a name appears in my files under , say , 'Pinko . ' '' In recent years , Bullock worked closely with San Francisco Police Officer Tom Gerard , who fled to the Phillippines last fall after he was questioned by the FBI in the case . A former CIA employee , Gerard supplied Bullock with criminal records and Department of Motor Vehicles information such as home addresses , vehicle registration , physical characteristics and drivers license photographs . Using files gathered for the Anti-Defamation League , Gerard and Bullock also provided information to the South African government , receiving $ 16,000 over four years , the documents show . The file on Times staff writer Kraft , which was apparently sold to the South African government , provides some insight into the hit-and-miss nature of the spy operation . The file notes that Kraft 's articles `` appear frequently in The Times and are well researched and written , '' but little else about the file is accurate . The brief entry confuses The Times ' Kraft with another Scott Kraft and provides the South African government with the wrong Kraft 's physical description , photograph and other personal information . Nevertheless , the documents provide illuminating details of how Bullock for decades infiltrated all manner of organizations , from skinheads to left-wing radicals , searching regularly through the trash of target groups . Using Anti-Defamation League funds , he also ran his own paid informants under code names such as `` Scott '' and `` Scumbag . '' He worked closely with police officers up and down the coast , exchanged information with the FBI and worked with federal agencies , including the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms . It was Bullock 's work as a paid informant for the FBI -- while spying on behalf of the Anti-Defamation League and the South African government -- that proved his undoing . The FBI learned that he was an agent of a foreign government and began investigating , leading to the probe of the Anti-Defamation League 's intelligence network . The Anti-Defamation League employed undercover operatives to gather information in Los Angeles , San Francisco , New York , Washington , Chicago , St. Louis and Atlanta , according to the affidavit and investigators . Joining San Francisco police in searching league offices and a Los Angeles bank were investigators from the office of San Francisco Dist . Atty . Arlo Smith and the state Franchise Tax Board . The Los Angeles Police Department , which earlier refused to cooperate with the investigation , was informed of the searches in Los Angeles but not invited to participate . Investigators suspect that some confidential information in the Anti-Defamation League files may have come from Los Angeles police officers . From Los Angeles Times , Saturday , April 10 , 1993 . P. A23 . ADL VOWS TO COOPERATE WITH SPY INVESTIGATION By Richard C. Paddock , Times staff writer . SAN FRANCISCO -- The Anti-Defamation League defended its record as a civil rights group Friday and said it will cooperate with authorities who are investigating whether the organization collected confidential police information on citizens and groups . But San Francisco Dist . Atty . Arlo Smith said that Anti-Defamation League employees involved in intelligence gathering could face many felony counts of receiving confidential files , eavesdropping , tax violations and conspiracy . Police have accused the Anti-Defamation League of not being truthful about its spying operations , which collected information on more than 12,000 individuals and 950 political groups across the political spectrum . Hundreds of pages of documents released by prosecutors Thursday show that the ADL maintained a nationwide intelligence network and kept files on political figures . Even so , Smith suggested that if the Anti-Defamation League shut down its spy operation , prosecutors would take that into account when deciding what charges to file . In a statement released in Washington , National Director Abraham H. Foxman described the ADL as `` a Jewish defense agency which has fought to protect all minorities from bigotry and discrimination for 80 years . '' Foxman said the organization is regarded as a credible source on extremist groups and has a tradition of routinely providing information to police , journalists , academics , government officials and the public . It has never been the policy of the ADL to obtain information illegally , he said . `` Like other journalists , in order to protect the confidentiality and physical safety of its sources , ADL will not comment on the nature or identity of any source of information , '' Foxman said . The Anti-Defamation League refused to acknowledge that one of its longtime employees , Roy Bullock , was anything more than `` a private individual who is alleged to be an ADL 'informant . ' '' Among the documents released by prosecutors were detailed statements showing how the ADL funneled weekly payments to Bullock through Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I. Hochman . `` Roy would penetrate organizations and needed this arrangement to be distanced from ADL , '' Hochman told a San Francisco police investigator . Hochman could not be reached Friday at his home or office for comment . Despite the Anti-Defamation League 's assertion that it will cooperate with authorities , San Francisco police said the group did not turn over all pertinent documents during a voluntary search of the group's offices in Los Angeles and San Francisco last fall . A second round of searches Thursday , this time with search warrants , produced a vast quantity of records , primarily dealing with financial transactions , Smith said . Further searches may be necessary and it will be at least a month before any charges are filed , he said . `` The investigation , of course , will go wherever the facts lead us , '' the district attorney said . -- Yigal Arens USC/ISI TV made me do it ! arens @ isi.edu js

Background imagery/textures/datafiles ========================================= First , check in the FTP places that are mentioned in the FAQ or in the FTP list above . 24-bit scanning : -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Get a good 24-bit scanner , like Epson 's . Suggested is an SCSI port for speed . Eric Haines had a suggestion in RT News , Volume 4 , # 3 : scan textures for wallpapers and floor coverings , etc . from doll house supplies . So you have a rather cheap way to scan patterns that do n't have scaling troubles associated with real materials and scanning area . Books with textures : -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Find some houses/books/magazines that carry photographic material . Educorp , 1-619-536-9999 , sells CD-ROMS with various imagery - also a wide variety of stock art is available .

Introduction to rendering algorithms ======================================== a. Ray-Tracing : -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - I assume you have a general understanding of Computer Graphics . No ? Then read some of the books that the FAQ contains . For Ray-Tracing , I would suggest : An Introduction to Ray Tracing , Andrew Glassner ( ed . ) , Academic Press 1989 , ISBN 0-12-286160-4 Note that I have not read the book , but I feel that you ca n't be wrong using his book . An errata list was posted in comp.graphics by Eric Haines ( erich @ eye.com ) There 's a more concise reference also : Roman Kuchkuda , UNC @ Chapel Hill : `` An Introduction to Ray Tracing '' , in `` Theoretical Foundations for Computer Graphics and CAD '' , ed . R.A.E.Earnshaw , NATO AS , Vol . F-40. , pp . 1039-1060 . Printed by Springer-Verlag , 1988 . It contains code for a small , but fundamentally complete ray-tracer . b. Z-buffer ( depth-buffer ) -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- A good reference is : _Procedural Elements for Computer Graphics_ , David F. Rogers , McGraw-Hill , New York , 1985 , pages 265-272 and 280-284. c. Others : -- -- -- -- -- ? ? ? [ More info is needed -- nfotis ] ======================================================================== 15 . Where can I find the geometric data for the : ================================================ a. Teapot ? -- -- -- -- -- - '' Displays on Display '' column of IEEE CG & A Jan '87 has the whole story about origin of the Martin Newell 's teapot . The article also has the bezier patch model and a Pascal program to display the wireframe model of the teapot . IEEE CG & A Sep '87 in Jim Blinn 's column `` Jim Blinn 's Corner '' describes an another way to model the teapot ; Bezier curves with rotations for example are used . The OFF and SPD packages have these objects , so you 're advised to get them to avoid typing the data yourself . The OFF data is triangles at a specific resolution ( around 8x8 [ x4 triangles ] meshing per patch ) . The SPD package provides the spline patch descriptions and performs a tessellation at any specified resolution . b . Space Shuttle ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Tolis Lerios < tolis @ nova.stanford.edu > has built a list of Space Shuttle datafiles . Here 's a summary ( From his sci.space list ) : model1 : A modified version of the newsgroup model ( model2 ) 406 vertices ( 296 useful , i.e . referred to in the polygon descriptions . ) 389 polygons ( 233 3-vertex , 146 4-vertex , 7 5-vertex , 3 6-vertex ) . Payload doors non-existent . Units : unknown . Simon Marshall ( S.Marshall @ sequent.cc.hull.ac.uk ) has a copy . He said there is no proprietary information associated with it . model2 : The newsgroup model , in OFF format . You can find it in gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au , file pub/off/objects/shuttle.geo hanauma.stanford.edu , /pub/graphics/Comp.graphics/objects/shuttle.data model3 : The triangles ' model . This model is stored in several files , each defining portions of the model . Greg Henderson ( henders @ infonode.ingr.com ) has a copy . He did not mention any restriction on the model 's distribution . model4 : The NASA model . The file starts off with a header line containing three real numbers , defining the offsets used by Lockheed in their simulations : < x offset > < y offset > < z offset > From then on , the file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions 3473 vertices . 2748 polygons ( 407 3-vertex , 2268 4-vertex , 33 5-vertex , 14 6-vertex , 10 7-vertex , 8 8-vertex , 8 12-vertex , 2 13-vertex , 2 15-vertex , 17 16-vertex , 2 17-vertex , 2 18-vertex , 3 19-vertex , 8 24-vertex ) . Payload doors closed . Units : inches . Jon Berndt ( jon @ l14h11.jsc.nasa.gov ) seems to be responsible for the model Proprietary info : unknown model5 : The old shuttle model . The file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions . 104 vertices . 452 polygons ( 11 3-vertex , 41 4-vertex ) . Payload doors open . Units : meters . We have been using this model at STAR Labs , Stanford University , for some years now . Contact me ( tolis @ nova.stanford.edu ) or my supervisor Scott Williams ( scott @ star5.stanford.edu ) if you want a copy . ======================================================================== 16 . Image annotation software ============================= a. Touchup runs in Sunview and is pretty good . It reads in rasterfiles , but even if your image is n't normally stored in rasterfile format you could use screendump to make it a rasterfile . b. Idraw ( part of Stanford 's InterViews distribution ) can handle some image formats in addition to being a MacDraw like tool . I 'm not sure exactly what they are . You can ftp the idraw 's binary from interviews.stanford.edu . c. Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap ( xbm ) and X11 pixmap ( xpm ) formats . If the image you have is in formats other than xbm or xpm , you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm . Tgif 's sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu ( Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9 ) d. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS ( see below ) . This is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package . e. You might be able to get by with PBMPlus . pbmtext gives you text output bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image . f. 'ice ' requires Sun hardware running OpenWindows 3.It 's a PostScript-based graphical editor , and it 's available for anonymous ftp from Internet host eo.soest.hawaii.edu ( 128.171.151.12 ) . Requires Sun C++ 2.0 and two other locally developed packages , the LXT library ( an Xlib-based toolkit ) and a small C++ class library . All files ( pub/ice.tar.Z , pub/lxt.tar.Z and pub/ldgoc++.tar.Z ) are available in compressed tar format . pub/ice.tar.Z contains a README that gives installation instructions , as well as an extensive man page ( ice.1 ) . A statically-linked compressed executable pub/ice-sun4.Z for SPARC systems is also available for ftp . All software is the property of Columbia University and may not be redistributed without permission . ice means Image Composition Environment and it 's an imaging tool that allows raster images to be combined with a wide variety of PostScript annotations in WYSIWYG fashion via X11 imaging routines and NeWS PostScript rasterizing . g. Use ImageMagick to annotate an image from your X server . Pick the position of your text with the cursor and choose your font and pen color from a pull-down menu . ImageMagick can read and write many of the more popular image formats . ImageMagick is available as export.lcs.mit.edu : contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z or at your nearest X11 archive . ======================================================================== 17 .

It seems more a image processing system than a generic SciVi system ( IMHO ) Major elements are : - a visual programming language , which automatically exploits the inherent parallelism - a code generator which converts the graph to a standalone program Iconified libraries present a rich set of point , filter , io , transform , morphological , segmentation , and measurement operations . A flow library allows graphs to employ broadcast , merge , synchronization , conditional , and sequencing control strategies . WIT delivers an object-oriented , distributed , visual programming environment which allows users to rapidly design solutions to their imaging problems . Users can consolidate both software and hardware developments within a complete CAD-like workspace by adding their own operators ( C functions ) , objects ( data structures ) , and servers ( specialized hardware ) . WIT runs on Sun , HP9000/7xx , SGI and supports Datacube MV-20/200 hardware allowing you to run your graphs in real-time .

This was developed at the University of Colorado ( Boulder ) by some people working for Alex Goetz . You might try contacting them if you already have IDL or would be willing to buy it . It 's a few thousand dollars ( American ) I expect for IDL and the other should be free . Those are the general purpose packages I 've heard of , besides what TerraMar has . SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery . I 'm not sure how general purpose it is . You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask . I have another piece of software ( PCW ) that does PC and Walsh transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image modification ( you can compute an image using selected components ) . I've used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems , but for the best speed you need an external DSP card . It will work without it , but large images take quite a while ( 50-70 times as long ) to process . That 's a freebie if you want it '' `` My favorite is IDL ( Interactive Data Language ) from Research Systems , Inc. IDL is in my opinion , much better and infinitely easier . Its programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like . It handles the number-crunching very well , also . Personally , I like doing the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX ( or Mathematica , Igor , or even Excel on the Mac if it 's not too hairy ) , then bringing it over to NIH Image for the imaging part . I have yet to encounter any situation which that combination could n't handle , and the speed and ease of use ( compared to IRAF ) was incredible . By the way , it 's mostly astronomical image processing which I 've been doing . This means image enhancement , cleaning up bad lines/pixels , and some other traditional image processing routines . Then , for example , taking a graph of intensity versus position along a line I choose with the mouse , then doing a curve fit to that line ( which I might do like in KaleidaGraph . ) `` [ For IDL call Research Systems , for PV-WAVE call Precision Visuals and for SIPS call University of Colorado @ Boulder .

GIS ( Geographical Information Systems software ) =================================================== GRASS -- -- - ( Geographic Resource Analysis Support System ) of the US Army Construction Engineering Research Lab ( CERL ) . It is a popular geographic and remote sensing image processing package . Many may think of GRASS as a Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package , although it is reported to have significant image processing capabilities . Feature Descriptions I use GRASS because it 's public domain and can be obtained through the internet for free . GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C. The source code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass Integration . You then compile the source code for your machine , using scripts provided with GRASS . I would recommend GRASS for someone who already has a workstation and is on a limited budget . GRASS is not very user-friendly , compared to Macintosh software . '' A first review of overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose image enhancement routines ( fft ) . Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in Boulder , CO is a primary user of GRASS . This gentleman has used the GRASS software and developed multi-spectral ( 238 bands ? ? ) volumetric rendering , full color , on Suns and Stardents . It was a really effective interface . Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps . You can call them at ( 303 ) 444-0094 or email care of greg @ vexcel.com 192.92.90.68 Host Configuration Requirements If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS on a Macintosh which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for satellite data . GRASS is public-domain , and can run on a high-end PC under UNIX . It is raster-based , has some image-processing capability , and can display vector data ( but analysis must be done in the raster environment ) . I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it easy to use . It is best , of course , for data that are well represented in raster ( grid-cell ) form . Availability CERL 's Office of Grass Integration ( OGI ) maintains an ftp server : moon.cecer.army.mil ( 129.229.20.254 ) . Mail regarding this site should be addressed to grass-ftp-admin @ moon.cecer.army.mil . This location will be the new `` canonical '' source for GRASS software , as well as bug fixes , contributed sources , documentation , and other files . This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and `` tar '' archiving of files . A feature attraction of the server is John Parks ' GRASS tutorial . Because the manual is still in beta-test stage , John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review it and mail him comments/corrections .

Microstation Imager -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Intergraph ( based in Huntsville Alabama ) sells a wide range of GIS software/hardware . Microstation is a base graphics package that Imager sits on top of . Imager is basically an image processing package with a heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor . Feature Description Basic geometry manipulations : flip , mirror , rotate , generalized affine . Rectification : Affine , 2nd , 3rd , 4th and 5th order models as well as a projective model ( warp an image to a vector map or to another image ) . RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion . Principal component analysis . Classification : K-means and isodata . Fourier Xforms : Forward , filtering and reverse . Filters : High pass , low pass , edge enhancing , median , generic . Complex Histogram/Contrast control . Layer Controller : manages up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band image or create color images by combining various individual bands , etc . The package is designed for a remote sensing application ( it can handle VERY LARGE images ) and there is all kinds of other software available for GIS applications . Host Configuration Requirements It runs on Intergraph Workstations ( a Unix machine similar to a Sun ) though there were rumors ( there are always rumors ) that the software would be ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment . PCI -- - A company called PCI , Inc. , out of Richmond Hill , Ontario , Canada , makes an array of software utilities for processing , manipulation , and use of remote sensing data in eight or ten different `` industry standard '' formats : LGSOWG , BSQ , LANDSAT , and a couple of others whose titles I forget . The software is available in versions for MS-DOS , Unix workstations ( among them HP , Sun , and IBM ) , and VMS , and quite possibly other platforms by now . I use the VMS version . The `` PCI software '' consists of several classes/groups/packages of utilities , grouped by function but all operating on a common `` PCI database '' disk file . The `` Tape I/O '' package is a set of utility programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape formats INTO , or write those formats out FROM , the `` PCI database '' file ; this is the only package I use or know much about . Other packages can display data from the PCI database to one or another of several PCI-supported third-party color displays , output numeric or bitmap representation of image data to an attached printer , e.g . an Epson-type dot-matrix graphics printer . You might be more spe- cifically interested in the mathematical operations package : histo- gram and Fourier analysis , equalization , user-specified operations ( e.g . `` multiply channel 1 by 3 , add channel 2 , and store as channel 5 '' ) , and God only knows what all else -- there 's a LOT . I do n't have and don't use these , so ca n't say much about them ; you only buy the packages your particular application/interest calls for . Each utility is controlled by from one to eight `` parameters , '' read from a common `` parameter file '' which must be ( in VMS anyway ) in your `` default directory . '' Some utilities will share parameters and use the same parameter for a different purpose , so it can get a bit confusing setting up a series of operations . The standard PCI environment contains a scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC , but which allows you to automate the process of setting up parameters for a common , complicated , lengthy or difficult series of utility executions . ( In VMS I can also invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure . ) There's also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled language programs which can interface with ( read from/write to ) the PCI data structures ( database file , parameter file ) . The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images , but requires such a level of operator expertise that , once you reach the level where you can handle r-s images , you can figure out ways to handle a few other things as well . For instance , the Tape I/O package offers a utility for reading headerless multi-band ( what Adobe PhotoShop on the Macintosh calls `` raw '' ) data from tape , in a number of different `` interleave '' orders . This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the graphic-arts industry 's `` CT2T '' format , would probably ( I have n't tried ) handle Targa , and so on . Above all , however , you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT YOU 'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start over . It 's worth noting that the PCI `` database '' file is designed to contain not only `` raster '' ( image ) data , but vectors ( for overlaying map information entered via digitizing table ) , land-use , and all manner of other information ( I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often contains all manner of information about the spectral bands , latitude , longitude , time , date , etc . of the original satellite pass ; all of this can go into the PCI `` database '' ) . I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used . On VAX systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific third-party display systems ( the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to mind ) . One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would display directly from a PCI `` database '' file to a Peritek VCT-Q ( Q-bus 24-bit DirectColor ) display subsystem . PCI software COULD be `` overkill '' in your case ; it seems designed for the very `` high end '' applications/users , i.e . those for whom a Mac/PC largely does n't suffice ( although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time ) . It's probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada , a country which does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing ; I believe the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these areas . SPAM ( Spectral Analysis Manager ) -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM ( Spectral Analysis Manager ) which got a fair amount of use at the time . That was designed for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery ( byte data , < = 256 pixels across by < = 512 lines by < = 256 bands ) ; a modified version has since been developed for AVIRIS ( Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer ) which uses much larger images . Spam does none of these things ( rectification , classification , PC and IHS transformations , filtering , contrast enhancement , overlays ) . Actually , it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement ( stretching ) . Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering . The original Spam uses X or SunView to display . The AVIRIS version may require VICAR , an executive based on TAE , and may also require a frame buffer . I can refer you to people if you 're interested . PCW requires X for display . MAP II -- -- -- Among the Mac GIS systems , MAP II is distributed by John Wiley . CLRview -- -- -- - CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers . This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources .

It seems to me that you are the one who is supposed to do some reading . I think that our major difference in opinion is on the legitimacy of Sevres . First , thattreaty was signed by the Ottoman Empire therefore legally it does not bind the Republic of Turkey . The new independence movement ( which by the way , is not the same as the Young Turks ) naturally rejected it out of hand . to say that we should accept because the Germans did theirs is absurd . We saw what the cosequences of such harsh treaties were in Hitler . Second , the Sevres treaty was even worse than Versailles . It divided the Ottoman Empire in to several influence zones , had the capital occupied , the economy under Allied control , the army di minished to nothing but a police force , in short a country in name only . I'd wonder if you would like to live under such conditions . And for the record , I donot feel sorry for the soldiers killed in IZMIR harbour . Before evacuating the city , the Greek forces burned it down , so it serves them right . As for being fooled by Allied promises , that too is your fault . You did not come to Anatolia just to enforce Sevres but to take part in the plunder as well . K. Burak Ucer -

This is definitely not a recommended procedure by Apple but I have done the equivalent to my CX after upgrading it to a Quadra 700 . The power supply is still the stock CX 's and it was able to power two Quantum LPS drives , a PLI SCSI accelerator , a Micron technologies 24 bit video board , Daystar QuickCache , New Technologies Overdrive and 20 meg of RAM simultaneously . I added a new mount for the drive by attaching angle brackets to the drive tower . The internal SCSI cable was changed to a longer flat ribbon cable onto which I added an extra connector about midway . The final HD was internally terminated and the drive between the motherboard and final HD had its terminator resistor packs removed . Cooling has not been a problem and no SCSI problems occur with either the PLI SCSI chain or motherboard SCSI hooked into the two internal hard drives . It works very well for me , but proceed cautiously if you wish to do the same .

This is old news . I can do this now . > There ARE no crypto restrictions ... yet . You can use anything you want > RIGHT NOW . The point is to maintain that right . There ARE restrictions . Example : We 're a networking software vendor with a large overseas share of our market . We can not currently ship PEM , or even simple DES , in our products without case-by-case approval from the Department of State . ITAR presents a material trade barrier to US firms trying to compete in international information systems markets . Sure , you can use whatever freebie software you want to talk over BBS 's in the USA . I , on the other hand , want strong crypto ( PKCS , for example ) to be the *default* for electronic mail , worldwide . I want priests to be able to hear confession over email . I want lawyers to be able to talk to clients in confidence over email , or doctors talk with patients . I want to be able to order products from my favorite Japanese mail-order catalog over the net . I want to be able to sign contracts , transact business , and so on electronically . This is so far infeasible as a result of the current restrictions on crytographic systems , especially beyond the borders of the USA . Clipper is irrelevant , and if it distracts the authorities into feeling safe , all the better . Its only danger is if it emboldens them into trying to put more restrictions into place , on the theory that it is `` good enough for anyone who has nothing to hide .

I look forward to it . The ultimate statement for equal rights ( something many of the feminazis have forgotten ) is `` I do not care if you are either a man or a woman , I do not care if you are black or white , I do not care if you are gay or straight . '' Once you can honistly say `` I do not care about color , race , or gender or sexual preference '' , then we will truly be on the right track . Keep shoving differences in my face and then expect us all to get along ? Get real ! So long as you try to make me care if you are black , female , or whatever , I am going to continue to balk . It 's natural human behaviour . But the moment employers searching for employees , banks looking to lend money , and theClinton administration looking for appointees can honistly say `` I do not care about your color , race , gender , or sexual preferences ; I instend instead to treat you as a human being , '' crap like last year's riots will continue to happen . > 1 . HEY MAN , ACADAMIA RULES ! ! Barf . You mean the same economic theorists who say things like `` for the sake of convenience in mathematical modeling we will first assume there is no wealth creation '' now get a crack at implementing their PhD thesis in real life ? Go back to your textbooks on macroeconomic theory . Look in the first chapter of that book , introducing the field of macroeconomic theory . Right there in chapter 1 , section 1 , is a statement like the following : '' As it is difficult to predict and model wealth creation , especially in an economy where wealth creation is inherently the province of individuals who create new inventions and discover new ideas , we will assume for the rest of this book that there is no wealth creation . `` We do not assume the lack of weath creation in the real world , however the mathematical modeling of such an inherently unpredictable subject is impossible . Even though we assume no wealth creation , we do believe that for most mathematical economic modeling such an assumption is reasonably valid as it allows us to make predictions which then can be tested . '' So the guys who are running the store for Clinton and company are now assuming that wealth creation does not exists . They are ( borrowing an idea from the Hitchhiker 's Guide ) too advanced to think of these simple things . To be honist , I would rather have an engineer with years of experience building bridges design the next bridge , rather than a theoretical physicists with a freshly minted PhD and no experience do the same job . - Bill Woody Normally I do n't post ( or even read most of the postings ) in this newsgroup .

I doubt the death penalty was supposed to be a `` deterrent '' to crime . If so , why does n't every crime carry a death penalty ? That would be effictive would n't it ? ? ? The death penalty is a punishment , much like a $ 50 fine for speeding is a punishment . Anyway , somebody with murder on the mind does n't much care about the consequences . I think another problem is that people dont think they will get caught . If I wanted to kill another person , I would n't care what the penalty was if I did n't think I would get caught . If it was to be strictly a deterrent , it should have been more along the lines of torture . Dave Fuller dfuller @ portal.hq.videocart.com

I think the three-headed GM 's guiding principle was to keep veterans in favor of youngsters only if they offered a `` significant '' advantage . At the end of last season , the contracts of several veterans with somewhat maginal contributions ( Fenton , Bozek , Anderson , and a couple others I ca n't remember ) were bought out . The idea was that youngsters could play almost as well , and had the potential to improve where these older guys did not . And they traded Mullen , because he wanted to go , not because he was n't good enough , but I think they were a bit too optimistic in thinking they could make up for his contributions . An example from this season , Skriko was brought in on a trial basis but not kept , because of his age . I thought he was a decent contributor worth keeping around . The youth movement has its advantages ; look at Gaudreau who might still be in KC if more veterans had been kept around . But you have to find the right balance . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Steve Cole ( steve @ sep.stanford.edu , apple ! sep ! steve ) Department of Geophysics , Stanford University , Stanford , CA 94305

Even as a libertarian , I have to admit government does do some things I like . There is a beautiful performing arts complex in Ft. Lauderdale that was partially built with tax dollars ( I do n't know how much was private and how much was stolen , I mean public ) but it is beautiful and I enjoy it . ( Keep in mind , though , most of the people in the city will never attend a single performance there , so they might feel differently about having to help pay for it . ) However , I have to disagree about it being desireable or efficient to give government intervention-power on a case-by-case basis . In fact , we have a lot better luck maintaining our freedom of speech precisely because it is not decided on a case-by-case basis as much as other issues . Judges decide whether political speech is allowed on the sidewalk in front of the post office . They do not try to decide just whether pro-nazi , pro-choice , pro-life , or pro-tax political speech should be allowed on the sidewalk in front of the post office . You can imagine the result if right to free speech was decided by the majority on a case-by-case basis . Not so with economic issues . Government does tell taxi-drivers exactly what they can charge , but not the bus lines or the lawyers . Just as it is not desireable to decide rights of free speech on a case-by-case basis , we should not decide rights to free enterprise on a case-by-case basis . There is hope that a government can be restricted from interferring with free enterprise . But there is no hope , in my opinion , of having a government that interferes with free enterprise in an `` efficient '' manner ; I call it political market failure . Thus , if you value freedom and the abundance it produces , you have to swallow the `` whole libertarian agenda . '' Roger Collins

From : drw3l @ delmarva.evsc.Virginia.EDU ( David Robert Walker ) Subject : Re : Young Catchers Organization : University of Virginia Lines : 70 Most of this discussion has been between Mark Singer and David Tate , with Valentine weighing in on the same side as Dave at various times . My opinion , FWIW , to all : Mark , age does n't matter ; ability does . I would rather have the untried rookie with great minor league numbers than the veteran who has proven himself to be average at best . I do n't care if he is 15 ; if he plays better than what I have , I want him out there . Sandy Alomar had decent minor league numbers , grossly inflated by the PCL in general and Las Vegas in particular ; he should have been projected as an average major league hitter ( which is good for a catcher , I 'll admit ) . Santiago's numbers would probably come out the same as Sandy 's , but I do n't have the league data from the mid-80s to check it out . That being said , I agree with sending Lopez to Richmond , at least to start the season . As the box below shows , he has *one* minor league season in which he hit well . He has two in which he hit very , very poorly . I want to see that the 92 Lopez is real . Olson and Berryhill are not complete mediocrities ; for catchers , especially NL catchers , they are essentially average hitters , with equivalent averages around .220 . If he had hit well at prior levels , I would say he belongs on the Braves ; but there is a reasonable chance that Lopez last year was just as much a fluke as Alomar in 90 or Santiago in 87 . One year at any level , at any age , does n't satisfy MY standards of evidence .

Granted , I thought his behavior with McCarver last year was completely bush . Last year was the first time he ever got 300 AB in one place , so his lines are hard to read . But he has a combined 720 OPS in minor league play ; with his speed is more valuable than the OPS alone indicates ; and at a still young age ( 24 ) , had a monster year with an 868 OPS . He has a total , major and minor , EQA of .249 ; above major league average , and above average for CF ( which was about .240 in the NL last year ) . He has shown at least the potential of going into the .290s , which would make him one of the 15 best hitters in the league . He has two full seasons before reaching his `` prime '' season of 27 .

In any case , the Winbench > results are pretty much inflated . Two things that annoyed me about the PC Magazine review : 1 . Their benchmarking technique is seriously flawed , as was clearly shown by the Graphite and # 9GXE 's `` cheating '' . Ca n't they just admit that their benchmark is to easy to optimize for and/or cheat on ? WinTach is much harder to beat ... 2 . The big `` cheat '' that Hercules/IIT used was overlappipping BitBlit and PolyLine optimization , and Hercules sent them a new driver which didn't do this -- but produced almost identical scores . Yet , the only thing PC Magazine says is that scores are not `` legitimate '' -- could n't they at least make some comment about its real-world performance ? I 'm not so much going by WinBench for performance , but , rather , by Steve Gibson 's results , which are more real-world based ( like using Micrografx Draw to benchmark ) . If you believe Gibson , that is ... : ) He writes : `` Despite these documented cheats , I have to say that in real-world applications the Hercules Graphite adapter actually draws faster than any other display adapter in the industry .

Sure . > Nothing I 'm doing would be of the slightest interest to President Nixon . I am sure you did n't miss the implication that we could have another Richard Nixon type president in the future ( perhaps not too distant future , acutally ) . With that in mind , then I take it you also would not object to the Gov coming up with a decision ( not proposal - just like Clinton Cripple is a decision , not a proposal ) sprung on us to start placing video cameras with sound in every room of your house , which could be activated without your knowlege . They would be well concealed so you would n't know the location , to prevent you from covering the lens opening . After all , nothing you 're doing would be of the slightest interest to a government official , right ? So , you surely should not object to such a proposal ... Not the best anology , but the principle is pretty close - the ability to eavesdrop on your activity with little or no effort , without your knowlege , protected by entirely by `` government safeguards '' . You can still draw your curtains , so you can still have your privacy from everyone else ( except Big Brother ) ! ! After all we need this for protection from drug dealers and terrorists and other criminals ( like 'enemies of the STATE ' ) ... and you do n't really have a right to `` unbreakable '' privacy anyway , sort of as the press release of the Clinton Cripple DECISION puts it ... I find it curious they use the word `` unbreakable '' when the term really should be `` difficult to break without proper authorization '' ( which the Government most certainly has at their disposal , right ? They wouldn't want to be able to break it ILLEGALLY , would they ? ) ... Nawww , not '' for the People '' Clinton ... . Can you , while my mind is on it , give us one good reason that the algorithm should be a secret algorithm , unless this encryption scheme either is a joke , or contains features like a 'master key ' or other back door for UNAUTHORIZED eavesdropping ? If it was really even moderately secure , and the government really meant to require the proper court order and the keys that are in the Escrow accounts to be able to decipher the traffic , what is the need to keep the algorithm secret ? Seems I hear rather often that if an encryption scheme requires the algorithm to remain a secret to be effective , it is not a worthwhile scheme ... is this just idle talk , or is the Administration bullshitting everyone ? With GREAT skepticism , and many doubts on our Administrations intentions ... And WAIT ! ! We have n't been told the NEXT gem the Administration has in mind for e-mail and datafile security . The press release does say that this is part of a comprehensive thing on data security for us unprivileged citizens . Perhaps 'subjects ' would be the better term - 'citizens' somehow does not seem appropriate ... that implies a free people , 'subjects' better fits a population who serve at the pleasure of their rulers .

The greenhouse effect ( produced by infrared-trapping gasses like CO2 and methane ) and the ozone-hole problem ( produced by long-lived , chlorine-containing molecules ) are not the same thing . It is a lot easier to do something about not using the CFC's ( chloro-fluorocarbons ) than it is to stop producing CO2 and methane which are natural byproducts of combustion and of living ( animal ) organisms . Planting more trees and not destroying so many existing trees would help the greenhouse-gas problem , but would do nothing for the ozone problem . Fred W.

Glover > -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- The Cold War has not ended . The only thing that has happened is that the two sides have exchanged roles . The USA has a higher imprisonment rate ( 400 per 100,000 population ) than any country in Europe by a factor of 10 or so . In California , it is over 600 per 100,000 population . The prison population in California is now over 100,000 , a quadrupling since 1980 . Most of these inmates were convicted under the drug prohibition laws . Police now confiscate property , without trial , under a `` good faith probable cause '' standard , in the name of depriving the horrible ghastly drug dealers of their ill-gotten gains . Conduct an opinion poll , and a majority will answer `` yes '' if you ask them whether civil liberties and due process should be diluted in order to Send Our Young People The Message That We Are Serious About Winning The War On Drugs . I don't know whether anyone has measured such a figure among gun owners , but I would expect the same result . They certainly seem to vote that way . According to Jack Herer 's book _The Emperor Wears No Clothes_ , over TWELVE MILLION YEARS of prison time have been served under the marijuana prohibition laws , by people who were minding their own business and causing no harm to others ( and less harm to themselves than users of tobacco , with 400,000 confirmed kills/year ) . Under the `` War on Drugs '' campaign of `` zero tolerance '' due process protections have eroded , and mandatory sentences of ten years without parole have proliferated . By and large , gun owners have voted for the politicians who favor such measures . And now , all the precedents -- not only legal , but political : `` My fellow Americans , we must send our young people the message that we are serious about winning the War On Murder '' -- are going to be applied to the oncoming wave of gun prohibition laws . Gun owners are about to get a taste of the medicine they voted for believing it would be used only on those with different tastes in recreational drugs . What goes around comes around . Alan T.

Geez , Dal must have slipped something into Ted 's drink sometime . Comparing Prince to Pagnozzi offensively is laughable . Prince has never hit well in the minors and he 's now 27 years old , I think . Pagnozzi was not a bad hitter in the minors . ( I 'll bring in the numbers tomorrow assuming I do n't have another brain cramp and forget . ) He had a very good year at Louisville before coming up to the majors . As I recall , the hype on Pagnozzi coming up in the organization was good hit , decent fielding . When he got to the majors and did n't hit as well as expected ( not as much playing time ? ) , he became Exhibit 312 in Nichols ' Law of Catcher Defense and got the reputation as an outstanding defensive catcher .

BTW , I 'm still unhappy with moving Zeile , who had the same reputation coming up in the Cardinal organization as Pagnozzi , except that he was a much , much better hitter , to 3rd where he could be an average hitter and a below average fielder instead of a well-above average hitter as an average ( or below average ) fielding catcher .

Both courses , Intensive Elementary Japanese and Intensive Intermediate Japanese , are ten week , ten credit courses each equivalent to one full year of Japanese language study . They begin June 7 and end August 13 . The courses meet five days per week , five hours per day . There is a flat rate tuition charge of $ 1600 per course . Fellowships available for science and engineering students . Contact Steven Brener , Program Manager of the Japanese Science and Technology Management Program , at the University of Pittsburgh at the number or address below .

Students and professionals in the engineering and scientific communitites are encouraged to apply for classes commencing in June 1993 and January 1994 . PROGRAM OBJECTIVES The program intends to promote technology transfer between Japan and the United States . It is also designed to let scientists , engineers , and managers experience how the Japanese proceed with technological development . This is facilitated by extended internships in Japanese research facilities and laboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to develop long-term professional relationships with their Japanese counterparts . PROGRAM DESIGN To fulfill the objectives of the program , participants will be required to develop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan and its culture . Correspondingly , JSTMP consists of three major components : 1 . TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE Several Japanese language courses will be offered , including intensive courses designed to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in a relatively short time . 2 . EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTURE A particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of the cultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches in manufacturing and information technology . Courses will be available in a variety of departments throughout both universities including Anthropology , Sociology , History , and Political Science . Moreover , seminars and colloquiums will be conducted . Further , a field trip to Japanese manufacturing or research facilities in the United States will be scheduled . 3 . AN INTERNSHIP OR A STUDY MISSION IN JAPAN Upon completion of their language and cultural training at PITT and CMU , participants will have the opportunity to go to Japan and observe , and participate in the management of technology . Internships in Japan will generally run for one year ; however , shorter ones are possible . FELLOWSHIPS COVERING TUITION FOR LANGUAGE AND CULTURE COURSES , AS WELL AS STIPENDS FOR LIVING EXPENSES ARE AVAILABLE .

I thought about mentioning how Reagan and the military treated the press in Grenada and how that set the precedent , but decided it was n't worthy of discussion . If the news reporter got shot , you can bet his family would sue the government for letting him into the danger area . The root cause of suspicion in my mind is why 100 people would n't flee a building that had numerous exits during the 30 minutes time it took to burn down . Or why did n't they flee hours earlier when the tear gas was first introduced ? I can find no rational explanation for their behavior . --

For me , it would be an obvious choice : Armed self-defence is clearly and strongly protected by the Colorado Constitution and the laws of the state . In the very clear-cut situation of your hypothetical , I would n't have anything to fear from the police ( unless I had been publicly carrying the weapon concealed , something I 'm not in the habit of doing ... Even then , the worst I 'd have to deal with was a class 2 misdemeanor . ) Even if the situation were not so clear , and I might have to worry about arrest for manslaughter or homicide , it would still be safer to wait for the police . If I were to leave and try to avoid police involvement , I 'd be committing several felonies and ruining my chances of claiming self-defence in court ( `` If it really was self-defence , '' the prosecuter would ask , `` why did you run away and hide from the police ? '' ) In other states , however , this decision might not be so clear-cut : If someone in , say , Washington D.C. were to use a gun in self-defence he would _automatically_ be guilty of several felony violations of that city 's gun control laws . Such a person 's choices would be between certain conviction for a couple of felonies versus possible conviction for half a dozen . Frank Crary CU Boulder

I am not so sure of Jewish proselytism then , but I would like to relate an account of a recent dinner I had with Jews a few months ago . The dinner was instigated by the aunt of the hostess , whom I had met while visiting my wife in Galveston last October . The dear old aunt ( now deceased ) was very proud of her Jewish heritage , although not especially devout . Her parents were both murdered in Nazi concentration camps in Austria during WWII because they were Jewish . While conversing with her about politics , world affairs and religion , she remarked that it would be a good idea for me to visit her niece on my return to Atlanta . Within two days of returning to Atlanta , her niece called to invite me over for dinner with her husband . I went , not knowing really what to expect , other than stimulating conversation and fellowship . What I got , however , was rather unexpected . The thrust of the evening 's discussion was to condemn the Reagan-Bush policies prohibiting abortion counseling in federally funded family planning clinics , prohibiting the sterilization of minorities on welfare here and in Puerto Rico , on the ban on fetal tissue research , and against the Mexico City policy , '' which denies U.S. foreign aid to programs overseas that promote abortion . '' The crux of their position was to place the blame for the problems of '' overpopulation , '' rampant domestic crime , African starvation , unwed mothers , etc. , on Christianity , rather on the fall of Adam . Now , this is not what I had to come to talk about . But every time I tried to bring up the subject of Judaism , they would condemn Jews for Jesus and admonish me against converting to Judaism , `` because it involves too much study and effort . '' And I did not even raise the prospect , nor try to convert them to the truth of Christ ! There was certainly no Jewish proselytism going on there . And again , last November I toured a `` traditional '' Jewish synagogue and was subjected to a 30-minute harangue against Jesus and Christianity in general . I realize that these are two isolated incidents , and that the best supervisor I ever had at work is Jewish , but from my experience , the modern Jew is not known for his proselytism . -- boundary no teneis que pensar que yo haya venido a traer la paz a la tierra ; no he venido a traer la paz , sino la guerra ( Mateo 10:34 , Vulgata Latina )

The network is expected to cost between $ 75 million and $ 125 million but is an essential part of the Clinton administration 's health reform plan , according to the CDC and outside experts . The plan will require the CDC to enhance surveillance of disease in the United States and establish about 15 facilities across the world to track disease . ===================================================================== April 13 , 1993 ===================================================================== '' NIH Plans to Begin AIDS Drug Trials at Earlier Stage '' Nature ( 04/01/93 ) Vol . 362 , No . 6419 , P. 382 ( Macilwain , Colin ) HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 42 Volume 6 , Number 10 April 20 , 1993 The National Institutes of Health has announced it will start treating HIV-positive patients as soon as possible after seroconversion , resulting from recent findings that show HIV is active in the body in large numbers much earlier than was previously believed . Anthony Fauci , director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) , said , '' We must address the question of how to treat people as early as we possibly can with drugs that are safe enough to give people for years and that will get around microbial resistance . '' He said any delay would signify questions over safety and resistance rather than a lack of funds . Fauci , who co- authored one of the two papers published last week in Nature , rejects the argument by one of his co-authors , Cecil Fox , that the new discovery indicates that `` $ 1 billion spent on vaccine trials '' has been `` a waste of time and money '' because the trials were started too long after the patients were infected and were ended too quickly . John Tew of the Medical College of Virginia in Richmond claims that the new evidence strongly backs the argument for early treatment of HIV-infected patients . AIDS activists welcomed the new information but said the scientific community has been slow to understand the significance of infection of the lymph tissue . `` We 've known about this for five years , but we 're glad it is now in the public domain , '' said Jesse Dobson of the California-based Project Inform . But Peter Duesberg , who believes that AIDS is independent of HIV and is a result of drug abuse in the West , said , `` We are several paradoxes away from an explanation of AIDS -- even if these papers are right .

A9 The risk of HIV being transmitted from infected health-care professionals to patients is minimal , according to new research published in today 's Journal of the American Medical Association ( JAMA ) . This finding supports previous conclusions by health experts that the chance of contracting HIV from a health care worker is remote . Three studies in the JAMA demonstrate that thousands of patients were treated by two HIV-positive surgeons and dentists without becoming infected with the virus . The studies were conducted by separate research teams in New Hampshire , Maryland , and Florida . Each study started with an HIV-positive doctor or dentist and tested all patients willing to participate . The New Hampshire study found that none of the 1,174 patients who had undergone invasive procedures by an HIV-positive orthopedic surgeon contracted HIV . In Maryland , 413 of 1,131 patients operated on by a breast surgery specialist at Johns Hopkins Hospital were found to be HIV-negative . Similarly in Florida , 900 of 1,192 dental HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 43 Volume 6 , Number 10 April 20 , 1993 patients , who all had been treated by an HIV-positive general dentist , were tested and found to be negative for HIV . The Florida researchers , led by Gordon M. Dickinson of the University of Miami School of Medicine , said , '' This study indicates that the risk for transmission of HIV from a general dentist to his patients is minimal in a setting in which universal precautions are strictly observed .

The OAM is a small division of the NIH , with its budget only at $ 2 million dollars compared to more than $ 10 billion for the NIH as a whole . In addition , the money for available research grants is even smaller . About $ 500,000 to $ 600,000 total will be available this year for 10 or 20 grants . Kaiya Montaocean , of the Center for Natural and Traditional Medicine in Washington , D.C. , says the OAM is afraid to become involved in AIDS . `` They have to look successful and there is no easy answer in AIDS , '' she said . There is also a common perception that the OAM will focus on fields the NIH establishment will find non-threatening , such as relaxation techniques and acupuncture . When the OAM called for an advisory committee conference of about 120 people last year , the AIDS community was largely missing from the meeting . In addition , activists ' general lack of contact with the Office has added suspicion that the epidemic will be ignored . Jon Greenberg , of ACT-UP/New York , said , `` The OAM advisory panel is composed of practitioners without real research experience . It will take them several years to accept the nature of research . '' Nevertheless , Dr. Leanna Standish , research director and AIDS investigator at the Bastyr College of Naturopathic Medicine in Seattle , said , `` Here is a wonderful opportunity to fund AIDS research . It 's only fair to give the Office time to gel , but it 's up to the public to insist that it 's much , much more [ than public relations ] .

This attack causes the killer cells to malfunction , diminishing an important component in the immune system 's fight against diseases . Also , the herpesvirus-6 may be a factor in immune diseases , such as AIDS . In 1989 , Paolo Lusso 's research found that herpesvirus-6 attacks another white cell , the CD4 T-lymphocyte , which is the primary target of HIV . Lusso also found that herpesvirus-6 can HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 44 Volume 6 , Number 10 April 20 , 1993 kill natural killer cells . Scientists previously knew that the natural killer cells of patients infected with HIV do not work correctly . Lusso 's research represents the first time scientists have indicated that natural killer cells are vulnerable to any kind of viral attack , according to Anthony L. Komaroff , a researcher with Harvard Medical School . Despite the test-tube findings , scientists are uncertain whether the same result occurs in the body . Lusso 's team also found that herpesvirus-6 produces the CD4 receptor molecule that provides access for HIV . CD4 T-lymphocytes express this surface receptor , making them vulnerable to HIV 's attack . Researchers concluded that herpesvirus-6 cells can exacerbate the affects of HIV . ====================================================================== April 15 , 1993 ==================================================================== '' AIDS and Priorities in the Global Village : To the Editor '' Journal of the American Medical Association ( 04/07/93 ) Vol . 269 , No . 13 , P. 1636 ( Gellert , George and Nordenberg , Dale F. ) All health-care workers are obligated and responsible for not only ensuring that politicians understand the dimensions of certain health problems , but also to be committed to related policies , write George Gellert and Dale F. Nordenberg of the Orange County Health Care Agency , Santa Ana , Calif. , and the Emory University School of Public Health in Atlanta , Ga. , respectively . Dr. Berkley 's editorial on why American doctors should care about the AIDS epidemic beyond the United States details several reasons for the concerted interest that all countries share in combating AIDS . It should be noted that while AIDS leads in hastening global health interdependence , it is not the only illness doing so . Diseases such as malaria and many respiratory and intestinal pathogens have similarly inhibited the economic development of most of humanity and acted to marginalize large populations . Berkley mentions the enormous social and economic impact that AIDS will have on many developing countries , and the increased need for international assistance that will result . Berkley also cites the lack of political aggressiveness toward the AIDS epidemic in its first decade . But now there is a new administration with a promise of substantial differences in approach to international health and development in general , and HIV/AIDS in particular . Vice President Al Gore proposes in his book `` Earth in the Balance '' a major environmental initiative that includes sustainable international development , with programs to promote literacy , improve child survival , and disseminate contraceptive technology and access throughout the developing world . If enacted , this change in policy could drastically change the future of worldwide health . ==================================================================== '' AIDS and Priorities in the Global Village : In Reply '' Journal of the American HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 45 Volume 6 , Number 10 April 20 , 1993 Medical Association ( 04/07/93 ) Vol . 269 , No . 13 , P. 1636 ( Berkley , Seth ) Every nation should tackle HIV as early and aggressively as possible before the disease reaches an endemic state , even at a cost of diverting less attention to some other illnesses , writes Seth Berkley of the Rockefeller Foundation in New York , N.Y. , in reply to a letter by Drs . Gellert and Nordenberg . Although it is true that diseases other than AIDS , such as malaria and respiratory and intestinal illnesses , have similarly inhibited economic development in developing countries and deserve much more attention than they are getting , Berkley disagrees with the contention that AIDS is receiving too much attention . HIV differs from other diseases , in most developing countries because it is continuing to spread . For most endemic diseases , the outcome of neglecting interventions for one year is another year of about the same level of needless disease and death . But with AIDS and its increasing spread , the cost of neglect , not only in disease burden but financially , is much greater . Interventions in the early part of a rampantly spreading epidemic like HIV are highly cost-effective because each individual infection prevented significantly interrupts transmission . Berkley says he agrees with Gellert and Nordenberg about the gigantic social and economic effects of AIDS and about the need for political leadership . But he concludes that not only is assertive political leadership needed in the United States for the AIDS epidemic , but even more so in developing countries with high rates of HIV infection and where complacency about the epidemic has been the rule .

The trial will compare the safety of three HIV experimental vaccines in 90 children recruited from at least 12 sites nationwide . Volunteers must be HIV- infected but have no symptoms of HIV disease . HHS Secretary Donna E. Shalala said this initial study can be seen as `` a hopeful milestone in our efforts to ameliorate the tragedy of HIV-infected children who now face the certainty they will develop AIDS . '' Anthony S. Fauci , M.D. , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and of the NIH Office of AIDS Research , said the trial `` is the first step in finding out whether vaccines can help prevent or delay disease progression in children with HIV who are not yet sick . '' If these vaccines prove to be safe , more sophisticated questions about their therapeutic potential will be assessed in Phase II trials . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 10,000 children in the United States have HIV . By the end of the decade , the World Health Organization projects 10 million children will be infected worldwide . The study will enroll children ages 1 month to 12 years old . NIAID , which funds the AIDS Clinical Trials Group network , anticipates conducting the trial at nine ACTG sites around the country and three sites participating in the ACTG but funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development . Preliminary evidence from similar studies under way in infected adults shows that certain vaccines can boost existing HIV-specific immune responses and HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 47 Volume 6 , Number 10 April 20 , 1993 stimulate new ones . It will be several years , however , before researchers know how these responses affect the clinical course of the disease . The results from the pediatric trial , known as ACTG 218 , will be examined closely for other reasons as well . `` This trial will provide the first insight into how the immature immune system responds to candidate HIV vaccines , '' said Daniel Hoth , M.D. , director of NIAID 's division of AIDS . `` We need this information to design trials to test whether experimental vaccines can prevent HIV infection in children . '' In the United States , most HIV-infected children live in poor inner-city areas , and more than 80 percent are minorities , mainly black or Hispanic . Nearly all HIV-infected children acquire the virus from their mothers during pregnancy or at birth . An infected mother in the United States has more than a one in four chance of transmitting the virus to her baby . As growing numbers of women of childbearing age become exposed to HIV through injection drug use or infected sexual partners , researchers expect a corresponding increase in the numbers of infected children . HIV disease progresses more rapidly in infants and children than in adults . The most recent information suggests that 50 percent of infants born with HIV develop a serious AIDS-related infection by 3 to 6 years of age . These infections include severe or frequent bouts of common bacterial illnesses of childhood that can result in seizures , pneumonia , diarrhea and other symptoms leading to nutritional problems and long hospital stays . At least half of the children in the trial will be 2 years of age or younger to enable comparison of the immune responses of the younger and older participants . All volunteers must have well-documented HIV infection but no symptoms of HIV disease other than swollen lymph glands or a mildly swollen liver or spleen . They can not have received any anti-retroviral or immune- regulating drugs within one month prior to their entry into the study . Study chair John S. Lambert , M.D. , of the University of Rochester Medical School , and co- chair Samuel Katz , M.D. , of Duke University School of Medicine , will coordinate the trial assisted by James McNamara , M.D. , medical officer in the pediatric medicine branch of NIAID 's division of AIDS . `` We will compare the safety of the vaccines by closely monitoring the children for any side effects , to see if one vaccine produces more swollen arms or fevers , for example , than another , '' said Dr. McNamara . `` We 'll also look at whether low or high doses of the vaccines stimulate immune responses or other significant laboratory or clinical effects . '' He emphasized that the small study size precludes comparing these responses or effects among the three HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 48 Volume 6 , Number 10 April 20 , 1993 products . The trial will test two doses each of three experimental vaccines made from recombinant HIV proteins . These so-called subunit vaccines , each genetically engineered to contain only a piece of the virus , have so far proved well- tolerated in ongoing trials in HIV-infected adults . One vaccine made by MicroGeneSys Inc. of Meriden , Conn. , contains gp160 -- a protein that gives rise to HIV 's surface proteins -- plus alum adjuvant . Adjuvants boost specific immune responses to a vaccine . Presently , alum is the only adjuvant used in human vaccines licensed by the Food and Drug Administration . Both of the other vaccines -- one made by Genentech Inc. of South San Francisco and the other by Biocine , a joint venture of Chiron and CIBA-Geigy , in Emeryville , Calif. -- contain the major HIV surface protein , gp120 , plus adjuvant . The Genentech vaccine contains alum , while the Biocine vaccine contains MF59 , an experimental adjuvant that has proved safe and effective in other Phase I vaccine trials in adults . A low dose of each product will be tested first against a placebo in 15 children . Twelve children will be assigned at random to be immunized with the experimental vaccine , and three children will be given adjuvant alone , considered the placebo . Neither the health care workers nor the children will be told what they receive . If the low dose is well-tolerated , controlled testing of a higher dose of the experimental vaccine and adjuvant placebo in another group of 15 children will begin . Each child will receive six immunizations -- one every four weeks for six months -- and be followed-up for 24 weeks after the last immunization .

HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 49 Volume 6 , Number 10 April 20 , 1993 NEW EVIDENCE THAT THE HIV CAN CAUSE DISEASE INDEPENDENTLY News from the National Institute of Dental Research There is new evidence that the human immunodeficiency virus can cause disease independently of its ability to suppress the immune system , say scientists at the National Institues of Health . They report that HIV itself , not an opportunistic infection , caused scaling skin conditions to develop in mice carrying the genes for HIV . Although the HIV genes were active in the mice , they did not compromise the animals ' immunity , the researchers found . This led them to conclude that the HIV itself caused the skin disease . Our findings support a growing body of evidence that HIV can cause disease without affecting the immune system , said lead author Dr. Jeffrey Kopp of the National Institute of Dental Research ( NIDR ) . Dr. Kopp and his colleagues described their study in the March issue of AIDS Research and Human Retroviruses . Developing animal models of HIV infection has been difficult , since most animals , including mice , can not be infected by the virus . To bypass this problem , scientists have developed HIV-transgenic mice , which carry genes for HIV as well as their own genetic material . NIDR scientists created the transgenic mice by injecting HIV genes into mouse eggs and then implanting the eggs into female mice . The resulting litters contained both normal and transgenic animals . Institute scientists had created mice that carried a complete copy of HIV genetic material in l988 . Those mice , however , became sick and died too soon after birth to study in depth . In the present study , the scientists used an incomplete copy of HIV , which allowed the animals to live longer . Some of the transgenic animals developed scaling , wart-like tumors on their necks and backs . Other transgenic mice developed thickened , crusting skin lesions that covered most of their bodies , resembling psoriasis in humans . No skin lesions developed in their normal , non-transgenic littermates . Studies of tissue taken from the wart-like skin tumors showed that they were a type of noncancerous tumor called papilloma . Although the papillomavirus can cause these skin lesions , laboratory tests showed no sign of that virus in the animals . Tissue samples taken from the sick mice throughout the study revealed the presence of a protein-producing molecule made by the HIV genetic material . HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 50 Volume 6 , Number 10 April 20 , 1993 Evidence of HIV protein production proved that the viral genes were `` turned on , '' or active , said Dr. Kopp . The scientists found no evidence , however , of compromised immunity in the mice : no increase in their white blood cell count and no signs of common infections . The fact that HIV genes were active but the animals ' immune systems were not suppressed confirms that the virus itself was causing the skin lesions , Dr. Kopp said . Further proof of HIV gene involvement came from a test in which the scientists exposed the transgenic animals to ultraviolet light . The light increased HIV genetic activity causing papillomas to develop on formerly healthy skin . Papilloma formation in response to increased HIV genetic activity proved the genes were responsible for the skin condition , the scientists said . No lesions appeared on normal mice exposed to the UV light . The transgenic mice used in this study were developed at NIDR by Dr. Peter Dickie , who is now with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases . Collaborating on the study with Dr. Kopp were Mr. Charles Wohlenberg , Drs . Nickolas Dorfman , Joseph Bryant , Abner Notkins , and Paul Klotman , all of NIDR ; Dr. Stephen Katz of the National Cancer Institute ; and Dr. James Rooney , formerly with NIDR and now with Burroughs Wellcome . HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 51 Volume 6 , Number 10 April 20 , 1993 Clinical Consultation Telephone Service for AIDS H H S N E W S ******************************************** U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES March 4 , 1993 HHS Secretary Donna E. Shalala today announced the first nationwide clinical consultation telephone service for doctors and other health care professionals who have questions about providing care to people with HIV infection or AIDS . The toll-free National HIV Telephone Consulting Service is staffed by a physician , a nurse practitioner and a pharmacist . It provides information on drugs , clinical trials and the latest treatment methods . The service is funded by the Health Resources and Services Administration and operates out of San Francisco General Hospital . Secretary Shalala said , `` One goal of this project is to share expertise so patients get the best care . A second goal is to get more primary health care providers involved in care for people with HIV or AIDS , which reduces treatment cost by allowing patients to remain with their medical providers and community social support networks . Currently , many providers refer patients with HIV or AIDS to specialists or other providers who have more experience . '' Secretary Shalala said , `` This clinical expertise should be especially helpful for physicians and providers who treat people with HIV or AIDS in communities and clinical sites where HIV expertise is not readily available . '' The telephone number for health care professionals is 1-800-933-3413 , and it is accessible from 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. EST ( 7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. PST ) Monday through Friday . During these times , consultants will try to answer questions immediately , or within an hour . At other times , physicians and health care providers can leave an electronic message , and questions will be answered as quickly as possible . Health care professionals may call the service to ask any question related to providing HIV care , including the latest HIV/AIDS drug treatment information , clinical trials information , subspecialty case referral , literature searches and other information . The service is designed for health care professionals rather than patients , families or others who have alternate sources of information or materials . When a health care professional calls the new service , the call is taken by either a clinical pharmacist , primary care physician or family nurse practitioner . All staff members have extensive experience in outpatient and inpatient primary care for people with HIV-related diseases . The consultant asks for patient-specific information , including CD4 cell count , current medications , sex , age and the patient 's HIV history . This national service has grown out of a 16-month local effort that HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 52 Volume 6 , Number 10 April 20 , 1993 responded to nearly 1,000 calls from health care providers in northern California . The initial project was funded by HRSA 's Bureau of Health Professions , through its Community Provider AIDS Training ( CPAT ) project , and by the American Academy of Family Physicians . `` When providers expand their knowledge , they also improve the quality of care they are able to provide to their patients , '' said HRSA Administrator Robert G. Harmon . M.D. , M.P.H . `` This project will be a great resource for health care professionals and the HIV/AIDS patients they serve . '' `` This service has opened a new means of communication between health care professionals and experts on HIV care management , '' said HRSA 's associate administrator for AIDS and director of the Bureau of Health Resources Development , G. Stephen Bowen , M.D. , M.P.H . `` Providers who treat people with HIV or AIDS have access to the latest information on new drugs , treatment methods and therapies for people with HIV or AIDS .

This kind of behavior is what I was shocked by in my 'experience ' . For crying out loud , how do these turkeys think they can talk to customers this way and still stay in business ? Again , I do n't expect sales people to bow , scrape , and grovel in my presence but I sure do n't expect to be abused either . I was very surprised by the way the sales people talked to me and in other 'negotiating ' sessions I overheard in neighboring sales cubicles . Evidently , their success rate is high enough that they continue to do business this way . There must be a lot of people out there who are easy to intimidate . On the other hand , I 'm not sure about the 'one price , no haggling ' approach that Saturn and other are starting to use . I guess if their fixed price is fair it 's OK. Maybe the best approach is to do your homework before you go in . Find out the invoice prices of the car , add a reasonable profit for the dealer ( $ 200- $ 300 ? ? ) , offer them that price and stick to it . If they get abusive , just leave . Then , do n't let them try to screw you after the deal is agreed on . Mark

The civil precision is about 20 to 30m ( correct me , if I 'm wrong ) , though , it may be insufficiant for mapping buildings . But there is a way with an additional reference point ( e.g . one fixed GPS system in a house ) to get the same high precision as the military version , but it gets pretty complicated then .

Well , the key does n't quite fit if you're > Montreal . I do n't buy this at all . Roy was the reason the game was tied ... and that would *not* have been the case had Dionne kept his cool . Hextall gave up 2 very questionable goals himself ... Both Dionne 's and Bellows ' shots were misplayed by Hextall , but just because his gaffes were early in the game , no one seems to care . Roy stood on his head for the first 15 minutes of the game when the Nords were rushing from end-to-end . Kamensky 's mini-break after the tying goal and the first shot by Young in OT were both excellent chances stopped by Roy . Roy outplayed Hextall for most of the game , but Roy becomes the villain and Hextall the hero because Roy 's team did n't make full use of their opportunities . Hextall , on the other hand , had a lot of lucky bounces ... he played very well , but the Haller shot off the post in OT , the rebound bouncing over Bellows ' stick , the Brunet breakaway , the 3 chances for LeClair ... all those opportunities were *not* finished off by Montreal , and it cost them . Hextall was n't particularly brilliant on those plays ... > Blaming Stewart is just an > excuse to avoid facing the fact that Roy allowed what was one of the worst > goals he could possibly allow . He even saw the whole shot , dammit . Sure , no excuse ... but it was just the 1 goal . The timing stank , but against an explosive team like Quebec , they gave them 1 opportunity too many with a powerplay that was totally unnecessary . > Montreal played a solid game ( although they still do n't know how to clear > traffic in front of the net ; the loss of Schneider will hurt even more ) . I disagree . Roy played well because he was n't screened the whole night . The defense , for the 1st time this season , played remarkably , keeping Sakic , Nolan , and Sundin out of the slot most of the night . > Normally I would say that any team that blows a 2-goal lead with less than > five , let alone two , minutes to go in regulation time IN A PLAYOFF GAME > ESPECIALLY needs to be smacked upside their collective heads . But I don't > think this was a team loss ( although Keane should have been able to clear > the zone just prior to the first Quebec goal ) . This most certainly was a team loss ... Leclair missed his opportunities , as did Bellows and Brunet . Dionne took a bad penalty . Damphousse and Lebeau were *silent* . Carbonneau and Savard were a step behind all night . Roy gave up the bad goal . Roy , by no means , can be singled out for this loss . > Roy is paid big money to > play . He looked like a player in an industrial league on Sakic 's shot . And Hextall did n't on Dionne 's goal ? Please . Roy is paid big money because that is his value compared to other goalies ... and he still is in the top 5 , when you consider the defense , or lack of one , that played in front of him for most of the season . > Demers should start Racicot in the next game . If not that , he should let > the damn team read the papers for the next day or two ... .and maybe this > article , if possible . The Montreal media is the quickest to heap praise and then hurl derogatory comments against the Habs . They are no better than uninformed fans . Why should they read the papers ? They played 58 minutes of `` Burnsian '' hockey to shut down Quebec . All they need tonight , and for the rest of the series is the extra 2 . Red Light to face Quebec ... rubbish . That 's a guaranteed way to end the series 4-0. Who would be taught a lesson by this ? The fans , the media , and Racicot , perhaps . Certainly not the rest of the team . > I did n't think the wrap-around was as bad as the second goal . I also didn't > think Scott Young should have gotten around the defender ( ca n't remember who ) > in the first place . But you are correct , it should n't have gone in > regardless . If you mean the goal should never have gone in , because there should never have been an OT , then I agree . But the goal itself was a great piece of work by Young . Roy had both the near and far posts covered , but Young flipped the puck up under Roy 's arm as he wrapped-around the net ... not a bad goal at all . Yaska ! yaska @ eecg.toronto.edu !

Perhaps we have different definitions of absolute then . To me , an absolute is something that is constant across time , culture , situations , etc . True in every instance possible . Do you agree with this definition ? I think you do : > Similarly , all truth is absolute . Indeed , a non-absolute truth is a > contradiction in terms . When is something absolute ? When it is always > true . Obviously , if a `` truth '' is not always `` true '' then we have a > contradiction in terms . A simple example : In the New Testament ( sorry I do n't have a Bible at work , and can't provide a reference ) , women are instructed to be silent and cover their heads in church . Now , this is scripture . By your definition , this is truth and therefore absolute . Do women in your church speak ? Do they cover their heads ? If all scripture is absolute truth , it seems to me that women speaking in and coming to church with bare heads should be intolerable to evangelicals . Yet , clearly , women do speak in evangelical churches and come with bare heads . ( At least this was the case in the evangelical churches I grew up in . ) Evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture to be absolute truth . ( And there are plenty of other examples . ) Can you reconcile this ? > Many people claim that there are no absolutes in the world . Such a > statement is terribly self-contradictory . Let me put it to you this > way . If there are no absolutes , should n't we conclude that the statement , > `` There are no absolutes '' is not absolutely true ? Obviously , we have a > contradiction here . I do n't claim that there are *no* absolutes . I think there are very few , though , and determining absolutes is difficult . > This is just one of the reasons why Christians defy the world by claiming > that there are indeed absolutes in the universe . > > There is hardly consensus , even in evangelical > > Christianity ( not to mention the rest of Christianity ) regarding > > Biblical interpretation . > > So ? People sometimes disagree about what is true . This does not negate > the fact , however , that there are still absolutes in the universe . But you are claiming that all of Scripture is absolute . How can you determine absolutes derived from Scripture when you ca n't agree how to interpret the Scripture ? It 's very difficult to see how you can claim something which is based on your own *interpretation* is absolute . Do you deny that your own background , education , prejudices , etc . come into play when you read the Bible , and determine how to interpret a passsage ? Do you deny that you in fact interpret ?

Traditionally , they have used pictures , words , demonstrations , music and dance to communicate imagery . However , expressing complex notions such as God and infinity or a seemingly well defined concept such as a flower can present challenges which far exceed their technical skills . The explosive use of computers as visualization and expression tools has compounded this problem . In hypermedia , multimedia and virtual reality systems vast amounts of information confront the observer or participant . Wading through a multitude of simultaneous images and sounds in possibly unfamiliar representions , a confounded user asks : `` What does it all mean ? '' Since image construction , transmission , reception , decipherment and ultimate understanding are complex tasks , strongly influenced by physiology , education and culture ; and , since electronic media radically amplify each processing step , then we , as electronic communicators , must determine the fundamental paradigms for composing imagery for understanding . Therefore , the purpose of this conference is to bring together a breadth of disciplines , including , but not limited to , the physical , biological and computational sciences , technology , art , psychology , philosophy , and education , in order to define and discuss the issues essential to image understanding within the computer graphics context .

From : farenebt @ craft.camp.clarkson.edu ( Droopy ) Subject : AHL Season in review ( off ice stuff ) Organization : Clarkson University Lines : 114 Nntp-Posting-Host : craft.clarkson.edu X-Newsreader : TIN [ version 1.1 PL8 ] Here is a review of some of the off-ice things that have affected the AHL this year . ST JOHN 'S MAPLE LEAFS PROBLEMS The St John 's Maple Leafs sophomore season has been plagued by problems . On-ice , the Leafs won the Atlantic Division title but off ice was less happy . A strike by public workers has forced the leafs out of the Newfoundland city for much of the last half of the seaosn ( since mid-Jan ) . They have played `` home '' games in places like Montreal , Cornwall and Charlottetown . Their playoff `` home '' games will be played in the Metro Center in Halifax , NS . One demostration got violent . Workers attacked a Leafs ' bus and rocked it and broke windows in the St John 's Memorial Stadium . Despite the problems , Toronto officials insist that the Leafs will return to St John 's once the strike ends . =================================================== SENATORS SOLD The New Haven Senators have been sold by Peter Shipman to the Ottawa Senators NHL organization . They are the only Canadian NHL team with an American AHL affiliate , and have made it clear they intend to move the team to somewhere in the Canadian Atlantic Provinces . This sale and move has yet to be approved by the AHL head office , but is expected to pass easily at the general meeting in May . The quote in the story from Jack Butterfield made it clear the league was more interested in the stability of the AHL franchise accompanied by NHL ownership , rather than maintaining the 56-year history of the AHL in New Haven . The Senators are currently in serious negotiations with Charlottetown New Brunswick and are expected to move there . ================================================== DALLAS HELPS HAWKS STAY IN MONCTON After announcing that they would pull their affiliation out of Moncton , the Winnipeg Jets changed their mind . The Jets announced the move when they said that they would be slashing their minor league roster from 20-something to around a dozen ; and they wanted to share with an existing AHL or IHL franchise . Enter the Dallas Lone Stars . Dallas agreed to supply the remaining 6 or 8 players to the Moncton franchise . Thus keeping the Hawks in the New Brunswick city . The deal is for one year and will be extended to three years if the season ticket base increases to over 3000 . The Hawks only sold 1400 for this year . ============================================================ SAINT JOHN FLAMES OFFICIAL The Calgary Flames have officially signed a deal with the city of Saint John , NB . The Saint John Blue Flames will play in the 6200 Exhibition Center . The Flames still have to apply for an expansion frnachise from the AHL but are expected to have no trouble . ========================================================= CAPS FOLLOW JACKS TO MAINE Despite rumors to the contrary , the Capitals will follow the Baltimore Skipjacks to Maine . The Caps ' current farm team , the Baltimore Skipjacks , announced that they would move to Maine and become the Portland Pirates . There was much doubt as to if the Caps would follow but they announced a limited deal with Portland . They would supply a dozen or so players including 2 goalies . They become the third team to announce a limited farm team along with Moncton and the Capital District Islanders . ====================================================== AHL GAME OF THE WEEK In early January , the AHL started a game of the week . The game , produced by , I believe , Pyman Productions , was televised across the Canadian Maritimes and northeastern US . The first few weeks saw two games of the week , one in Canada and another in the US but since then , there has been only one . Sunday afternoon and night games were covered and shown on Sportschannel NY and NE in the US and , I believe , Atlantic Sports Network in Canada ( but I 'm not sure about that ) . I am not sure if playoff games will be covered . ===================================================== UTICA GONE ? SYRACUSE ADDED ? There were heavy rumors that the Utica Devils will not be around next season . There were rumors that they might be headed to a midwestern city and that the city of Syracuse is trying to lure them . ===================================================== WHAT THE AHL MIGHT LOOK LIKE NEXT YEAR ONE OPTION ANOTHER OPTION Northern Division Southern Division ADIRONDACK RED WINGS ADIRONDACK SPRINGFIELD INDIANS SPRINGFIELD PROVIDENCE BRUINS PROVIDENCE CD ISLANDERS CDI PORTLAND PIRATES HERSHEY BINGHAMTON Southern Division ROCHESTER HERSHEY BEARS HAMILTON BINGHAMTON RANGERS UTICA ROCHESTER AMERICANS HAMILTON CANUCKS Atlantic Division UTICA ( ? ) DEVILS PORTLAND ST JOHN'S Atlantic Division SAINT JOHN ST JOHN 'S MAPLE LEAFS MONCTON MONCTON HAWKS HALIFAX HALIFAX CITADELS FREDERICTON CAPE BRETON OILERS CAPE BRETON FREDERICTON CANADIENS CHARLOTTETOWN SAINT JOHN BLUE FLAMES CHARLOTTETOWN SENATORS ( move is unofficial as yet ) ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ + Bri Farenell farenebt @ craft.camp.clarkson.edu + + AHL and ECAC contact for rec.sport.hockey Go USA Hockey ! + + Adirondack Red Wings , Calder Cup Champs : '81 '86 '89 '92 + + Clarkson Hockey , ECAC Tournament Champ : '66 '91 '93 + + Glens Falls High School , Division II NY State Champs : '90 '91 + + Join the AHL mailing list : ahl-news-request @ andrew.cmu.edu + + CONGRATS TO CLARKSON GOLDEN KNIGHTS HOCKEY : 1993 ECAC CHAMPIONS ! ! ! + ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

From : skelley @ umiacs.umd.edu ( Stephen Kelley ) Subject : Expose/Configure event handling ( R4 vs R5 ) Organization : UMIACS , University of Maryland , College Park , MD 20742 Lines : 29 I have two questions ( well probably more ... ) about how Expose & Configure events are handled . I have an appl . which uses 1 window to draw in . Since I give the user the capability of scaling and zooming as well as allowing the window to be resized , I made a translation table for the Expose & Configure events . The Expose event calls my redraw method while the Configure event calls my rescale method . The rescale method invokes a `` fake '' Expose event ( actually just calls the redraw w/ an appropriate Expose struct ) to draw the data . Quest 1 . When the appl . is compiled/linked w/ R4 ( running in either R4 or R5 env . ) I get multiple ( > 4 ) redraws when the window gets uncovered or the size is changed . I assume I 'm getting cascading events . Is that right ? Any suggestions as to how to handle/trap events in a better way ? Quest 2 . When the appl . is compiled/linked w/ R5 I get no Expose events whatsoever . Do events and/or translation tables act differently in R5 ?

Reproduced under open license granted by Audio Books , Inc. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - This is the Dr. Beter AUDIO LETTER ( R ) , 1629 K St. NW , Washington , DC 20006 . Hello , my friends , this is Dr. Beter . Today is April 30 , 1982 , and this is my AUDIO LETTER ( R ) No . 74 . It 's now been almost one month since war broke out in the South Atlantic . On the surface it seems that it 's only a dispute between Argentina and Great Britain over the barren , wind-swept Falkland Islands and South Georgia Island . In reality , it 's far more than that . The so-called Falklands crisis is just the visible tip of a giant military operation . During this month of April 1982 , fierce naval battles have taken place -- not only in the South Atlantic but also in the South Pacific . Up to now most of the hostilities have been kept under wraps by wartime censorship on all sides . But as I say these words , the naval war in the Southern Hemisphere is about to come to the surface . Beginning today , April 30 , a total naval and air blockade of the Falklands by the Royal Navy has begun . At the same time a counterblockade has been declared by Argentina in the same area . To be effective , a blockade must be imposed over a period of time , but the Royal Navy does not have that much time . Winter is coming on in the South Atlantic , and the British supply lines are overextended . Having come this far , Her Majesty 's navy can not simply drop the blockade and sail away in a few weeks time without drawing blood from Argentina . As a result the British will be forced to undertake military operations very soon no matter how risky they may be . There is also another reason why the Royal Navy now has no choice but to engage the Argentine forces in combat . That reason , my friends , is that the Royal Navy has already suffered losses in secret combat this month . Up to this moment there will be no way to explain away the damage which has been sustained by the British fleet . Only when publicly admitted fighting erupts will the British dare to admit that they have suffered battle losses . To obtain that cover story , the British have no choice but to sail into combat ; but in doing so , they will be risking even heavier losses on top of those already sustained . In short , my friends , Her Majesty 's navy has sailed into a trap . The events now unfolding in the South Atlantic carry strange , ironic echoes of the past . For weeks now we 've been hearing countless commentators referring to the British task force as an '' armada '' ( quote ) . The British of all people ought to be very uneasy with that description . The original Spanish Armada 400 years ago was renowned as a seemingly invincible fighting force , but it came to grief in a naval disaster so complete that it changed the course of history -- and it was none other than the English navy that destroyed the Spanish Armada . The original Spanish Armada put to sea in 1588 during the reign of England 's Queen Elizabeth I . The Armada was an invasion fleet carrying thousands of crack fighting men to invade England . They were met by the daring sea dogs of Sir Francis Drake . Drake and his small , fast ships turned the tables on the Spanish Armada by changing the rules of battle . The English fleet was equipped with new longer-range guns , and it stayed upwind and out of reach . From there the English pounded , smashed , and shattered the big ships of the mighty Armada . When it was all over , barely half the Spanish fleet was left to limp back to port . Drake's defeat of the Spanish Armada was a shock to the world . It opened the door for England under Queen Elizabeth I to start its expansion into a truly global empire . Today , 400 years later , history seems to have come full circle . Queen Elizabeth II is witnessing the dismantling of the world empire whose heyday began under Queen Elizabeth I , and now the cultures of England and of Spain are once again in confrontation . Once again a so-called armada is preparing for invasion , but this time the armada is British , not Spanish . Four hundred years ago Sir Francis Drake was the hero of the day ; today , the ghost of Francis Drake is once again on the scene . The South Atlantic war zone is at the eastern end of the Drake Passage around the southern tip of South America . The defeat of the Spanish Armada four centuries ago broke the back of Spain's naval supremacy , and now the defeat of the new British armada may well break the back of what remains of the once glorious Royal Navy . My three special topics for this AUDIO LETTER are : Topic # 1 -- THE MILITARY SECRET OF SOUTH GEORGIA ISLAND Topic # 2 -- THE SECRET NAVAL WAR OF THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE Topic # 3 -- THE ROCKEFELLER FEAR CAMPAIGN AGAINST NUCLEAR WAR . Topic # 1 -- When the Falkland Islands crisis began early this month it looked at first like a tempest in a teapot . For a century and a half since 1833 , the Islands have been controlled by Great Britain . During that entire time , British sovereignty over the Falklands has been disputed by Argentina . There have been countless threats by Argentina to seize the Islands , which it calls the Malvinas , but the threats have always come to nothing in the past and Britain has never even gotten very worried about them . The Islands are four times as distant from Argentina as Cuba is from the United States , and they are not much of a prize . After 150 years of occupancy , the Falklands are home to fewer than 2,000 British settlers and a lot of sheep . In short , the remote Falkland Islands hardly look like something to fight over , and yet here we are watching another crisis take place . We are watching as war erupts between Great Britain and Argentina . The Thatcher government is acting as if it has forgotten all about its usual preoccupation with the Soviet threat at NATO's doorstep . Instead , Britain is throwing almost everything it's got at Argentina -- -aircraft carriers , cruisers , destroyers , submarines , assault ships -- you name it . Luxury cruise ships have even been commissioned and turned into troop carriers overnight . Wave after wave of additional assault troops have been activated and sent to join the fleet even after it sailed . Ships and submarines have been pulled off station from normal NATO duty and sent to reinforce the task force . The initial 40-ship force has grown steadily over the past several weeks into an armada numbering over 70 . Over two-thirds of the entire Royal Navy has already been deployed to the South Atlantic off Argentina . Watching all this , a lot of people are asking : What 's this fight really all about ? The most popular answer suggested in the major media is `` oil . '' Vast deposits of oil are known to exist under the continental shelf between Argentina and the Falklands , but that has been known for nearly 10 years . In no way does it explain the timing of the sudden military offensive by Argentina this month , and oil explains even less about the Argentine seizure of South Georgia Island . South Georgia Island is 800 miles east of the Falklands with no known oil deposits anywhere near it ; and compared to South Georgia , the Falklands are an island paradise . South Georgia Island is covered with rugged mountains , treacherous valleys , glaciers , and semi-permanent snow . Most of it is uninhabitable . On top of all that , Argentina has absolutely no legal or historical claim to South Georgia Island . In that respect it stands in sharp contrast to the Falklands . In the early 1830s the Falklands were occupied for a while by Argentine colonists . In 1833 the British expelled them and took over the Island . For that and other historical reasons , Argentina argues that the Falklands really belong to Argentina , not Britain . But no such argument is possible for South Georgia Island . It has always been controlled by Britain , never by Argentina or Spain . The Argentine seizure of South Georgia Island looks even more unreasonable from a military point of view . Argentina's leaders are military men and they think in military terms . They were well aware ahead of time that far-off South Georgia Island could not possibly be held for long . By seizing it they were setting themselves up to absorb a military defeat , as the Island was retaken by Britain . So the question is : Why did Argentina's military junta bother with the seemingly worthless South Georgia Island at all ? My friends , the answers to all these questions are military , not political or economic . South Georgia Island possesses an enormous military secret . It 's a giant underground installation buried under the mountains at the northwest end of the Island . The real reason for the so-called Falkland crisis is this secret installation , together with two other similar installations which I will describe shortly . The secret military complexes have been in existence for many years ; they are not new . What is new is the accelerated nuclear war timetable of the American Bolshevik war planners here in Washington . For the past two months I 've been reporting the details of this new war plan to you as quickly as I can obtain and verify them . The plan calls for NUCLEAR WAR ONE to erupt by September of this year 1982 ! ! It is this fast-approaching nuclear war threat that caused the so-called Falklands crisis to erupt now . What is going on now is a coordinated effort to spoil part of the Bolshevik grand strategy for the coming nuclear war . The mutual enemies of the American Bolsheviks here -- namely , the Rockefeller cartel -- and Russia 's new rulers in the Kremlin are behind the present crisis . They are trying to ruin Phase # 3 of the `` PROJECT Z '' war plan which I revealed last month . That phase is to be world domination by the American Bolsheviks after both Russia and the United States have been destroyed in NUCLEAR WAR ONE . As I mentioned last month , the key to this plan is the existence of secret weapons stockpiles in various places around the world . The American Bolshevik military planners here in America are working with other Bolshevik agents in key military positions of other countries to set off war . Having done that , they intend to ride out the nuclear holocaust they have caused , safe and cozy in Government war bunkers ! When the warring nations finally lie smoldering and exhausted , the Bolsheviks will leave the shattered remains of their host countries . They will rendezvous at the secret weapons installations and bring their weapons into the open . They will confront the world with the only remaining fresh , up-to-date , powerful military force on earth ; and using that military power , they will become the undisputed rulers of the world -- that is , they plan to do all this , and they plan to pave the way for world domination very soon by setting off NUCLEAR WAR ONE in a matter of months . The Rockefeller cartel and Russia 's new anti-Bolshevik rulers are working together in a race against time to try to head off the Bolshevik war plan . Last month I mentioned that the Bolsheviks here are benefitting from war preparations which were started by the Rockefellers long ago . It has only been about three years since the Rockefellers were dislodged as the prime movers of the United States Government by the Bolsheviks . Since that time the United States Government has been a house divided , torn by internal power struggles between rival Bolshevik and Rockefeller factions . But before that , the United States had been dominated for decades both economically and politically by the Four Rockefeller Brothers . In 1961 the Brothers launched a new long-range plan for world domination . It was a two-prong strategy , half visible and half secret , which I first described long ago in AUDIO LETTER No . 28 . It was a plan for the United States to arm to the teeth in secret while appearing to disarm gradually . Without repeating all the details , the basic idea was grandiose yet simple . By deliberately appearing weak , the Rockefeller-controlled United States would maneuver itself into a nuclear war with Russia . Then the secret weapons , including superweapons , would be unleashed to smash Russia and take over the world . When they set the grand plan in motion in 1961 , the Rockefeller Brothers were looking ahead to a nuclear war by the late 1970s . Their military analysts concluded very early that the war being planned would have very different effects on the Northern and Southern Hemispheres . Both superpowers , the United States and the Soviet Union , are located well up in the Northern Hemisphere ; so are the other full-fledged nuclear powers -- Great Britain , France , Red China , and India . By contrast , the strategic targets for nuclear war in the Southern Hemisphere are relatively few and far between . In other words , it was expected that the coming nuclear war would be essentially a Northern Hemisphere war . In an all-out nuclear holocaust it is known that serious radioactive fallout will gradually spread to affect even areas not initially hit by war . But there are limits to how far the war clouds can spread . It was discovered long ago that there is very little mixing between the air of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres . In the northern half of our planet , cold air from the North Pole works its way southward towards the equator , then it works its way back to the north as warm air . A mirror image of this process takes up the southern half of the planet . Northern and Southern Hemisphere air meet in the equatorial zone , but very little of the air changes places . The military conclusion , my friends , is this : the coming nuclear war could ruin large areas of the Northern Hemisphere for generations to come ; but if the calculations are right , the Southern Hemisphere could escape virtually unaffected by the war . This was music to the ears of the Four Rockefeller Brothers . A quick look at the globe of the world shows why . The Rockefeller cartel has dominated Latin America ever since World War II . As I discussed in my very first monthly AUDIO LETTER , Nelson Rockefeller solidified the cartel grip on Latin America during the war . He accomplished this as so-called `` Coordinator of Hemispheric Defense '' for then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt . So that takes care of the South American continent and its natural resources . Then there is the African continent . There , too , Rockefeller control was already in effect over wide areas of Black Africa , especially south of the equator . All this was thanks to the efforts of John D. Rockefeller III , as I detailed in AUDIO LETTER No . 36 . Looking around the globe , the most important remaining land masses from the standpoint of world domination are Australia and New Zealand . Thanks to World War II , both were wide open to the Rockefellers . The Rockefeller Brothers decided to establish secret military installations in the Southern Hemisphere for use after the coming war . By this means they expected to become the masters of the surviving southern half of planet Earth after the Northern Hemisphere war . Then , as the Northern Hemisphere gradually recovered from the nuclear holocaust , the Rockefeller empire would be able to pick up the pieces . In this way the third generation Rockefeller Brothers expected their family dynasty to inherit the Earth . In order to control the Southern Hemisphere militarily after the war , some means would have to be available to project military power onto any land mass . For example , revolts against Rockefeller domination would require troops -- not a blast from the beam weapons on the Moon . The most critical factor for postwar military domination of the world was found to be a navy . A minimum of two secret naval fleets would be required -- one based in the South Atlantic , the other in the South Pacific . Since the reserve naval fleets were to be kept secret until after the Northern Hemisphere nuclear war , they could not be built in existing shipyards . New construction facilities had to be built and they had to be hidden . To hide an entire shipyard is no small task ; they take up a lot of space . On top of that , it was essential that the ships remain hidden after they were built . The best way to achieve that was to combine the shipyard and naval base into one over-all secret installation . Finally , the secret naval installation had to be invulnerable to nuclear attack ; otherwise if its existence were ever discovered prematurely , the secret navy might be wiped out . The combined requirements for secrecy , space , and protection against attack were formidable ; but one day in 1959 , while all these plans were still in the early stages of development , the answer presented itself . During a so-called banking trip to Sweden , David Rockefeller was given a tour of a unique hidden naval port . The port is hollowed out from solid granite cliffs which come right down to the water . The entrance to the port is a gigantic hole in the side of the cliff which can be sealed off with enormous steel doors . Inside this big doorway on the water a huge cavity has been hollowed out to accommodate ships . The Rockefeller Brothers and their military adviser decided that a bigger , more secret , better protected version of the Swedish hidden port was just what they wanted . A survey of candidate sites was then initiated . The site survey covered coastal areas throughout the Southern Hemisphere . Many areas were rejected very quickly because the topography was wrong . Other areas were rejected because they were too close to the equator . Still others had to be ruled out because there were too many people living nearby , making the desired level of secrecy impossible . Finally , it was essential that the sites chosen for the secret naval installations be totally secure politically . At last the sites for the secret naval installations were selected . In the South Pacific , extreme southern New Zealand was selected . This is what I was alluding to in AUDIO LETTER No . 71 three months ago when I called attention to New Zealand 's extreme importance in the coming war . In order to obtain the necessary space , the secret New Zealand naval installation had to be divided up into two sites located close together . One is at the extreme southwest tip of South Island where the mountain range known as the Southern Alps comes down virtually to the water 's edge . The other part of the installation is built into the northwest tip of Stewart Island , which is off the tip of South Island . The Stewart Island facility is hollowed out within a rise known as Mt . Anglem . The New Zealand location met all the requirements . Ever since World War II the government of New Zealand has been tied even closer to the United States than to Great Britain . The location is far from the equator , and the installations are buried deep under mountains , protected from nuclear attack . They are also too deep to be reached by particle-beam attacks , and the New Zealand site is well situated to command the entire South Pacific . In the South Atlantic an even more perfect site was found . That site , my friends , is South Georgia Island . It is located perfectly for naval domination of the entire South Atlantic . The tall , rugged mountains provided a perfect location for the secret installation at the northwest tip of the 100-mile long island . It is controlled by Great Britain whose government , like that of New Zealand , was willing to cooperate ; and South Georgia Island was virtually uninhabited except for a whaling station on the northeast coast . The whaling station was some 50 miles away from the secret new installation which was being built , but Britain took no chances . In 1965 the whaling station was closed down . Since that time there have been no inhabitants on South Georgia Island except for a few dozen alleged Antarctic scientists . Construction of the secret naval facilities -- two in New Zealand , one on South Georgia Island -- began in the early 1960 's . The techniques were adapted from those used previously to build other large underground facilities , such as the NORAD installation inside Cheyenne Mountain , Colorado ; however these techniques were adapted in radically new ways to achieve construction access directly from the sea instead of overland . In this way , the sheltering mountain was left undisturbed in appearance both during and after construction . The cuts in the mountain side which were necessary to let ships in and out were kept as small as possible and were well camouflaged . Like the Swedish hidden naval port arrangement , the entrances to the secret installations can be sealed up . When sealed , the entrance is virtually impossible to detect unless you know exactly where it is ; and unlike most large construction projects , there are no tailings or piles of leftover rock lying around to attract attention . The man-made caverns which house the secret naval installations are enormous , but all the rock and debris was disposed of at sea . Once the secret naval facilities were built , they had to be outfitted for ship construction and docksite storage . The fake disarmament of the United States during the 1960s contributed greatly to this task . From 1961 to 1968 one man played a pivotal role in this elaborate Rockefeller scheme . He was then-Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara . All through the 60 's McNamara presided over the public paring back of America 's visible military power . This included the closing down and dismantling of entire shipyards . What we were not told was where all that shipyard equipment went afterwards . Where it went , my friends , was to the new secret installations which were being outfitted in New Zealand and South Georgia Island ! The secret naval installations have been used as duplication facilities to reproduce certain ships and submarines designed and built here in the United States . As Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger told Congress recently , it is cheaper to build two ships at a time . That is especially true if the second ship is an exact duplicate of the first . This has become even more true in recent years through the use of computerized manufacturing techniques . The secret naval fleets which have been built at the secret installations are made up of duplicates -- exact duplicates of certain other ships and submarines . They are all nuclear powered -- nuclear `` subs '' ; nuclear cruisers ; nuclear destroyers ; and yes , nuclear aircraft carriers , three of them . A secret twin was built for the U.S.S . Nimitz , for the U.S.S . Eisenhower , and for the newly-launched U.S.S . Carl Vincent . All have been financed through the gigantic cost overruns , so called , that we constantly hear about in the Defense Department ; and all three carriers have been provided with a full complement of aircraft whose manufacture was financed the same way ! The ships of the secret American Bolshevik naval fleets are all duplicates of other nuclear-powered vessels . Even so , the secret naval ships possess one key difference . Last month I revealed that the so-called `` Stealth Program '' has succeeded in developing a kind of electromagnetic invisibility shield . This technique makes an object invisible from a distance by distorting light waves in its vicinity . A whole new fleet of Phantom war-planes are now going into crash production that use this principle ; and , my friends , all of the secret American Bolshevik navy ships have already been outfitted with similar Stealth-field equipment ! The Stealth principle is actually easier to apply to ships than to airplanes because there is more room for the powerful equipment that generates the field . After NUCLEAR WAR ONE , the secret Stealth navy of the American Bolsheviks would be light years ahead of any other navy left on earth . It would be perfect for the intended role of world domination . The Rockefellers set it all in motion long ago , my friends , but three years ago they lost control of the United States Military . Now it 's the American Bolsheviks who are in control , and they are bent on war . These secret naval installations have precipitated what is being called the `` Falklands crisis . '' Topic # 2 -- In AUDIO LETTER ( R ) No . 73 last month I described '' PROJECT Z '' , the new Bolshevik three-phase strategy for NUCLEAR WAR ONE . An elite group of American Bolshevik military planners here are flushing out the plan right now at a secret war-room here in Washington . It 's a plan by which the United States will strike the first nuclear blow , followed by all-out thermonuclear war with Russia . Having set off the holocaust , the Bolsheviks here and in certain other countries plan to rise it out safe in comfortable war bunkers . Finally after NUCLEAR WAR ONE fizzles out in stalemate , they plan to leave behind the ashes of the United States and her allies . Activating Phase # 3 of their grand strategy , they plan to unveil their secret weapons , especially their secret naval fleets . With these they plan to conquer and rule what is left of the world . The United States as we know it will be dead and gone ; but in the eyes of the Bolsheviks themselves , this outcome will constitute victory . Up to now the nuclear war timetable which I first revealed two months ago is still on track . They are still shooting for nuclear war to begin by September of this year 1982 ! Time is fast running out . The Bolsheviks here are sprinting as fast as they can toward war ; but , my friends , the Bolsheviks are not the only runners in this race . They have two deadly enemies , both of whom are equally determined to trip up the Bolsheviks . One enemy of the Bolsheviks here is the Rockefeller cartel ; the other enemy is the new anti-Bolshevik ruling clique in Russia ; and now these two mutual enemies of the Bolsheviks are pooling their efforts in certain ways . In AUDIO LETTER No . 71 three months ago I reported that a limited , new anti-Bolshevik coalition was in the works between the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians . The January 26 meeting between Haig and Gromyko in Geneva , Switzerland , was a turning point in the formation of this coalition . It is now a reality , and is responsible for the so-called `` Falkland crisis '' now dominating the headlines . It should be emphasized that this new relationship between the Rockefeller cartel and Russia falls far short of a true alliance . They have very major disputes to be settled between them , but for the time being they have called a truce between themselves to deal with their mutual deadly enemy -- the Bolsheviks here in America . The first priority of the Russians and the Rockefellers is to slow down the Bolshevik preparations for imminent nuclear war . If they can do that , time is on the side of the Rockefeller cartel in certain political movements which I discussed last summer in AUDIO LETTER No . 67 . A slow-down in the nuclear war timetable will also give more breathing space for additional anti-Bolshevik actions to be implemented . The joint Rockefeller-Russian planners decided by mid-February that military action against the Bolsheviks was essential very quickly . No other type of action had any hope of taking effect fast enough to prevent nuclear war by the end of this summer . The exact details of the `` PROJECT Z '' war plan are not known to either the Rockefellers or the Russians , but the general outlines are known to be as I described last month . It was decided that military action should be devised that would undermine Phase # 3 of the Bolshevik war plan -- that is , the Bolshevik-controlled secret naval installations and fleets in the Southern Hemisphere should be attacked and crippled . By working together , the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians were able to devise an attack plan which neither could have carried out alone . The Rockefeller group , who built and originally controlled these bases , provided detailed Intelligence about the best way to attack them . The Russians with their enormous military machine provided the muscle to actually carry out the attack . It was essential to devise a scheme that would enable both secret fleets in the South Atlantic and South Pacific to be attacked . Survival intact of either fleet would leave the Bolshevik war plan still workable . Military analysts concluded very quickly that a direct assault on the New Zealand facilities was out of the question . There was no combination of commandos , frogmen , or other military force which could possibly keep an attack secret from the outside world . Any attack on the New Zealand bases would set off the very war which the Rockefellers and Russians want to prevent . But the situation in the South Atlantic was a different matter . In a way , the greatest asset of South Georgia Island was also its Achilles ' heel . The extreme isolation which protected the secrecy of the South Georgia base also made a covert military assault feasible . The key lay with Argentina and her long-standing claims to the Falkland Islands . As I mentioned in Topic # 1 , the Rockefeller cartel has dominated all of Latin America for decades . Cartel operatives were sent to Argentina to work out a deal with the government military junta there . The historic dispute over the Falkland Islands was to be used to provide a ruse , a military cover , to enable the South Georgia base to be attacked . The Argentine generals were not told everything about the situation by any means , but they were told enough to make clear what they were to do . As an inducement to cooperate , the Argentine leaders were promised handsome rewards . They were guaranteed that after the shooting was over , the Falkland Islands would remain in Argentine hands . This guarantee included the promise of covert military assistance as needed against the Royal Navy . And to bolster the troubled Argentine economy , it was promised that the Rockefeller cartel will help develop the immense offshore oil reserves . With these combined promises of military glory and financial rewards , the Argentine military junta agreed to the plan . On March 19 Argentina carried out Act # 1 in the joint attack plan . A group of Argentine scrap-metal merchants , of all things , landed at the abandoned old whaling station on South Georgia Island . Supposedly they were there to dismantle the old buildings and cart them off to sell . While they were at it they also raised the Argentine flag over the work-site . The British , always nervous about South Georgia Island , promptly reacted as expected . The British Antarctic survey ship `` Endurance '' put 22 Marines ashore . They drove off the scrap merchants and tore down the Argentine flag . The incident provided the desired excuse for the Argentine Junta to bring the simmering 150-year-old Falklands dispute to a boil . From time to time in the past , Argentina has claimed that South Georgia is part of the Falklands because it is administered that way by Britain . That argument is very flimsy but it now came in very handy . It was nothing new to hear this from Argentine leaders , so there was no hint of what was really afoot . During late March , Argentine military forces started assembling for an assault on the Falklands . `` Nothing new '' , thought the British high command . Argentina has carried out threatening maneuvers in the past many times . It was believed that they were about to do it again ; but on April 2 Argentine forces did the unexpected . After many past false alarms , this time they actually invaded and seized the Islands . All Argentine public statements emphasized the long-standing historical claims to the Falklands themselves ; but just for good measure , the next day a small Argentine force also seized far-off South Georgia Island . The force was so small that it gave the appearance initially that it was just a side show from Argentina 's point of view ; however , the small contingent of 22 Royal Marines were overpowered and bundled off the Island along with a group of 13 alleged scientists . That was the moment of payoff in the joint Rockefeller-Russian attack plan . Thanks to the elaborate distraction staged by the Argentine forces , a special commando team got onto the Island undetected . Based on the detailed Rockefeller information about the base , the team moved to a location on the mountain directly above the cavernous secret base . Special high-speed drilling equipment was set up by the Rockefeller members of the team while the Russian members concentrated on military defense . By late that evening , April 3 , the military high command in London finally learned what was really taking place . The secret South Georgia base was under attack by virtually the only means possible . The joint Rockefeller-Russian team were drilling a shaft down through the mountain toward the hollowed out cavern inside . It was only a matter of time until their drill would break through the ceiling of the giant hidden naval base . Once the hole was made , the next step was obvious . The Rockefeller-Russian team would put a weapon of some kind through the hole . The best guess was that it would be a nerve gas . The shock waves that went through the highest levels of the British government on the evening of April 3 can hardly be described , my friends . The Thatcher government , like the so-called Reagan Administration here in America , is Bolshevik controlled . That 's why Margaret Thatcher always says , `` Me , too '' any time the Reagan Administration says or does anything against Russia . Both governments are party to the secret nuclear war plan in complete betrayal of the people of their respective countries , and on the evening of April 3 they suddenly discovered that their precious war plan was in deep , deep trouble . Immediately the Thatcher government started assembling a naval armada to sail for the South Atlantic . Haste was the order of the day . The drilling on South Georgia Island was proceeding around the clock . The best estimates were that the drilling would break through into the roof of the naval base in about three weeks , on or about April 24 . If help did not reach South Georgia by then , the secret installation might be doomed . The forces stationed at the installation itself were unable to defend themselves under the circumstances . Their mighty naval ships were ships in a bottle . They did not dare open the bottle to sail out to fight because the Russian commandos were armed with tactical and nuclear weapons . To open the blast-proof entrance doors would be suicide . On April 5 , just two days after South Georgia Island was seized , some 40 naval ships began moving out of British ports . The same day Lord Carrington was sacked as Foreign Minister . He was forced to resign , my friends , because he had assisted the Rockefeller attack plan by downplaying the Argentine attack preparations . That same day , April 5 , New Zealand , the home of the other secret naval fleet , broke diplomatic relations with Argentina . The two hidden New Zealand facilities had been placed on `` Red Alert . '' As a precautionary measure , all submarines at the twin base were ordered to sea . Several surface ships were already at sea undergoing `` sea trials '' , but that still left seven ( 7 ) major ships inside the hidden twin naval base including one of the nuclear aircraft carriers I mentioned earlier . On that busy day of April 5 , Argentina 's Foreign Minister , Costa Mendez , was at the United Nations in New York . He was alarmed by the deployment of such a large part of the Royal Navy . Costa Mendez hurried here to Washington to seek reassurances from certain officials . He got them ! For the next two weeks or so the news was filled with stories about the allegedly slow movement of the British fleet while negotiations went on . That , my friends , was only a cover story . The Royal Navy was actually joining up and moving as rapidly as possible toward South Georgia Island . If the task force arrived in time to save the secret base , a major battle was likely . The official stories about `` slow movement '' of the British armada were intended to give a cushion of time for that battle . If need be , the fleet would have several days to retake South Georgia Island , then it could move on to arrive near the Falklands on the announced schedule . In this way the crucial importance of South Georgia Island would be hidden and the big secret preserved . It was initially expected that advance elements of the British fleet would reach the vicinity of South Georgia Island within two weeks . That would have been soon enough to attack the joint Rockefeller-Russian commando team and stop the drilling before it was completed . But Russian Cosmospheres and submarines made a shambles of the plan . Key advance elements of the South Georgia attack contingent left Ascension Island early April 14 , two days before it was announced officially . Shortly after they did so , they ran into trouble . Russian Cosmospheres and attack submarines closed in on a single ship which was critical to the planned counterassault on South Georgia Island . The Cosmospheres bombarded the bridge and combat information center of the ship with neutron radiation . In moments the ship was without any command , its communications and radar silenced . Then a Russian `` sub '' closed in and quickly finished off this key British ship with torpedoes . It broke apart with secondary explosions and sank rapidly . So far as is known , there were no survivors . This unexpected shock in the mid-Atlantic produced two results , both important : First , it caused a slowdown in the race toward the South Atlantic by the British armada . The task force had to be regrouped into a configuration better suited for an enroute defense , but that cost valuable time . Public announcements from London about the progress of the fleet reflected this slowdown . The timetable for arrival on battle stations near the Falklands started stretching out longer and longer . All this bought extra time for the joint commando team on South Georgia Island . The drilling continued . The other result of the sinking was equally important . Word was flashed to the South Pacific Stealth navy to prepare for possible action . It was obvious that the Russian Navy was getting involved in the Atlantic , which meant that the Royal Navy could be in big trouble . During the dead of night , early April 15 , the seven Stealth ships put to sea from their twin secret bases in southern New Zealand . They deployed to a secret operational headquarters area in the Antipodes Islands , 450 miles southeast of New Zealand . Their electromagnetic shields were operating to provide protection from attack . These shields make it impossible to communicate with the outside world or even to see it , as I explained last month ; but once they arrived at the Antipodes , the Stealth ships hooked up to buoys equipped with shielded communication cables to the Island headquarters . The Antipodes headquarters , in turn , was in constant touch with the South Georgia base by way of a transoceanic cable around the tip of South America . The deployment of the available ships of the South Pacific Stealth fleet was exactly what the joint Rockefeller-Russian planners had hoped for . The ships had been flushed out from their essentially invulnerable hiding place in New Zealand ! The British ship 's sinking of April 14 was also followed by other events . On April 15 the Argentine Navy started moving out of port . The same day , Alexander Haig arrived again in Buenos Aires . Supposedly he was there as a diplomat , but in reality he was there as a General , dealing with Generals . Haig is the top Governmental operative of the Rockefeller cartel , as I have revealed in the past . He was making sure that the Argentines did not get cold feet and back down at that critical moment . Four days later , April 19 , Haig left for Washington . As he boarded his plane , Haig somberly told reporters , `` Time is running out . '' And so it was , my friends , for the secret South Georgia base . The very next day , April 20 , the drill broke through into the hollowed-out cavern of the naval base . Bolshevik military analysts in London had not expected that it could be completed until at least the following weekend . The British fleet was still out of range . The weapon which the commando team inserted down through the long hole was a small , compact Russian neutron bomb . When it was detonated inside the confines of the huge artificial cave , the effects were devastating . The intense radiation instantly killed everyone inside the base . Also the heat and blast effects of the bomb are believed to have damaged all the ships inside sufficiently to badly disable them . Meanwhile , Russian Cosmospheres and submarines were converging on the Stealth ships which were near the Antipodes Islands awaiting orders . From a distance , the ships were invisible to the eye due to their protective shields , which also protect against beam-weapon attack ; but they were sitting ducks for the tactics which the Russians employed . Floating overhead , the Cosmospheres located the seven ships using their Psychoenergetic Range-Finding equipment known as PRF . As I have reported in the past , there is no method known by which PRF can be jammed . The Cosmospheres radioed the exact locations of the ships to the attack submarines . The `` subs '' were armed with special non-homing , non-nuclear torpedoes designed to explode on impact . More sophisticated torpedoes would have been thrown off course or detonated prematurely by the protective shield of each ship ; but these simple torpedoes just cruise right through each invisibility field to strike the ship and explode . Within 15 minutes after the attack began , all seven Bolshevik Stealth ships were on their way to the bottom , and with them went their Bolshevik Commanders and mercenary crews collected from around the world . The South Pacific action took place just after sunset local time . The time here in Washington was around 2:00 P.M. April 23 . That evening Secretary of State Haig was seen briefly in public with the new British Foreign Minister , Francis Pym . Pym was wearing the artificial pseudo-smile which diplomats are taught always to display in public . But not Haig . Haig was grinning from ear to ear , and no wonder . The joint Rockefeller-Russian military operation had been a brilliant success . The secret Bolshevik South Atlantic fleet had been virtually wiped out , bottled up inside South Georgia Island ; and the South Pacific fleet , while not totally wiped out , had been badly crippled . By working together , the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians had won the secret naval war of the Southern Hemisphere . Topic # 3 -- As I say these words , news reports give the impression that war is about to erupt in the South Atlantic , but the real war in the Southern Hemisphere is already over . What we are watching now is the beginning of its bloody aftermath . That aftermath is the battle for the Falkland Islands . They have been promised to Argentina as a reward for her role in the secret war . At this moment the Bolsheviks here in Washington are pressing for a public announcement that the United States will side with Britain . As soon as that takes place , military action will heat up fast around the Falklands . Britain has no choice but to fight . She has already suffered casualties which can not be explained without a public battle ; but by fighting , the Bolsheviks in Britain are running the risk of a humiliating and tragic defeat for the Royal Navy . Meanwhile , the Rockefeller strategists here are now concentrating on a fast-building , anti-nuclear-war campaign . On all sides now we are hearing about the so-called `` nuclear freeze movement . '' There are documentaries , articles , publicity of all kinds to sensitize us to the terrors of nuclear war . In recent months , there have even been referenda popping up on election ballots dealing with the nuclear war issue . Medical doctors are banding together to warn the public about what would happen if there were a nuclear war . We are being told that all this is just popping up spontaneously . We are now 37 years into the nuclear age and nothing like this has ever gained so much momentum before , yet now we are supposed to believe that millions of Americans have spontaneously gotten the same ideas at the same time . If you believe that , my friends , I give up . Movements like this never , and I mean never , develop without leadership , organization , and money -- and plenty of it . What we are watching is the Rockefeller public relations machine at work . As I 've explained in the past , the Rockefeller cartel can not afford to let a nuclear war take place . If it does , they will lose everything because they are not in a position to control it . Instead , the deadly enemies of the Rockefeller cartel , the Bolsheviks here , will win out if there is a war ; and so the Rockefeller faction is now doing everything in its power to prevent a nuclear war . The present anti-nuclear-war orientation of the Rockefeller cartel creates certain temporary common interests between them and Russia ; but as Russia 's new rulers know very well , this does not spring from any great moral perspective on the part of the Rockefeller group . It 's purely a matter of practical necessity right now for the Rockefellers . The Russians regard the United States as a house divided , and they are exploiting that division by working in careful ways with the Rockefellers . Their first priority is to rid the world of the deadly Bolshevik menace of all-out , even suicidal , nuclear war ; but once that is done , they know that there will be a day of reckoning with the Rockefeller cartel some day . The Rockefeller group is working toward a definite objective with their new anti-nuclear-war propaganda . That objective is renewed power -- and power that moves them closer to their old dream of WORLD GOVERNMENT . The Bolsheviks here have unwittingly provided fertile ground for the powerful new Rockefeller antiwar campaign . Under Bolshevik control , the so-called Reagan Administration has become so hawkish that it 's scaring people . The Rockefeller antiwar campaign is designed to capitalize on that latent fear as a tool of power . These days the smell of war is in the air . The Falklands crisis is helping to make that more intense . The Rockefeller propaganda machine is now paving the way for the argument that surrender of sovereignty is the only way to avoid war . A new super-United Nations of sorts is now in the works to fill the bill . It will have teeth ! As presently envisioned , the new organization will be based in Geneva , Switzerland . The working name , though this may be changed , is the `` World Nonproliferation Council . '' The plan is to bring it into being as the outgrowth of nuclear nonproliferation treaties , but its true purpose will be to use fear -- the fear of war -- to control us all . LAST MINUTE SUMMARY Now it 's time for my Last Minute Summary . In this AUDIO LETTER I have reported on the reasons behind the so-called Falkland Islands crisis . The crisis erupted because of secret Bolshevik-controlled naval installations in the Southern Hemisphere . These have been attacked by joint action of the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians in an attempt to slow down the nuclear-war timetable . The attacks were successful , but the results remain to be seen . One result , though , is that the Royal Navy has now been drawn into a trap . Britain 's Waterloo at sea may well be at hand . My friends , two factions are struggling for control over our United States -- the Rockefeller cartel and the Bolsheviks . They differ in style but both seek to control us through fear . If we are ever to rise above their trickery , it must be through the power of our Lord Jesus Christ , our only hope . As the Scripture tells us , our Lord `` ... has not given us the spirit of fear ; but of power , of love , and of a sound mind . '' We must learn to wage peace . As our Lord declared long ago , `` Blessed are the peacemakers : for they shall be called sons of God . '' Until next month , God willing , this is Dr. Beter . Thank you , and may God bless each and every one of you.

Well , think again . Sometimes the only real support out there is what Apple computer users can give to each other . For another example , read on : In the March 15th issue of _MacWeek_ , Ric Ford described a two-year effort by Liam Breck to document and bring to Apple 's attention a problem with certain defective mice . At random , the switches on these mice `` stick '' in the down position until clicked a second time , apparently regardless of the machine they are used with or the system software involved . Most of the reported problem mice were manufactured in Malaysia and have an FCC ID of BCGA65431 . You 'll recognize this `` sticky button '' symptom immediately if you have such a mouse : the problem is intermittent , but it 's not subtle . Liam Breck recently gave up trying to document this problem , and instead suggested that people contact Apple 's Customer Assistance Center directly ( _MacWeek_ 4/5/93 p. 64 ) . When I called Apple on March 23rd and described my defective mouse , I was eventually given a case number ( F83Y ) and told Apple would replace this mouse even though it is a few months out of warranty . After waiting for three weeks , I called back today wondering where my new mouse was . This time , I was told that Apple had decided the serial number on my mouse ( MB13831FC25 ) is not within the ( undisclosed ) range Apple is willing to replace , and there is nothing I can do about it . Nothing , that is , unless enough people complain about this problem to make it worth Apple 's while to fix or replace the entire lot of defective mice . Please , if you have one of these mice , I NEED YOUR HELP ! Do n't assume you know what causes the problem ( there are _lots_ of theories ) and start hacking around inside your hundred-dollar mouse . Instead , let Apple do it . Please take five minutes to CALL APPLE RIGHT NOW at : United States 1-800-776-2333 Canada 800-665-2775 UK and Europe 33-1-49-01-49-01 Australia 61-2-452-8000 Japan and Pacific 81-3-5411-8500 If the number is n't toll-free , call collect . Describe the problem and ask for a replacement mouse . Even if they refuse , insist that they register the details of your case , including your mouse 's serial number . Be firm . Network managers and user-group leaders especially , please query your user bases . Everyone ask your friends and colleagues . Please do n't send mail to me or post yet another `` sticky-button '' report , CALL APPLE DIRECTLY ! If enough victims take the trouble to report this well-known problem , Apple will eventually be forced to respond . If Apple continues to find it easy to stone-wall on this issue , do n't expect them to offer support when the next , potentially more serious Mac defect is uncovered . -- Bill Sloan

Lines : 13 > ... there is nothing in Christianity that precludes the idea of > repeated lives on earth . There is a paragraph in the New Testament which in my opinion , clearly makes a positive inference to reincarnation . I do n't remember which one it is off of the top of my head , but it basically goes like this : Jesus is talking with the apostles and they ask him why the pharisees say that before the messiah can come , Elijah must first come . Jesus replies that Elijah has come , but they did not recognize him . It then says that the apostles perceived that he was refering to John the Baptist . This seems to me to clearly imply reincarnation . Can anyone offer a reasonable alternative interpretation ? I would be very interested to hear it .

He meant the US spends more per capita on guns than Canada which isn't really surprising because we were so busy protecting the western world from the USSR that all other countries could slack off on their defense spending . I would like to see if the US spends more per capita on people than Canada does . This is a true apples - apples comparison where the previous post was apples - oranges .

Brendan Shanahan tied the game 3-3 and Brett Hull scored the game winner 17 seconds later . Jeff Brown and Denny Felsner scored the other Blues goals . Brian Noonan had the hat trick for the Hawks , who also had some very good goaltending from Ed Belfour . Blues goalie Curtis Joseph was solid down the stretch to preserve the Blues lead . The Hawks came out strong in the first period , outshooting the Blues 6-1 and taking a 1-0 lead on Noonan 's first goal . Right after an interference penalty on Rick Zombo had expired , Keith Brown intercepted a clearing attempt at the blue line and passed the puck to Steve Larmer in the right circle . Larmer fired a long slap shot , and Noonan deflected the puck between Joseph 's pads . After the goal , the Blues picked up the intensity and went on to outshoot the Hawks 10-9 in the first period . Jeff Brown tied the game 1-1 at 3:12 of the second . Nelson Emerson broke in on the left side , got by Craig Muni and pushed the puck across the slot . Belfour came out to play the pass and shoveled it to the right boards , where Brown collected it and slapped it in before Belfour could get back to the goal . Two minutes later on a Hawks power play , Belfour stopped Rich Sutter on a short-handed break-in . Chris Chelios picked up the puck and passed it to Jeremy Roenick who carried it on right wing and found an open Noonan with a nice pass across the slot . Noonan fired it past Joseph at 5:30 for the 2-1 lead . Noonan completed his hat trick 3:11 later to increase the Hawks ' lead to 3-1 . Stephane Matteau made a nice pass from the right boards to Noonan who beat Stephane Quintal by driving to the net . Joseph had no chance as Noonan deflected the puck in the net . Denny Felsner reduced the Blues deficit to 3-1 at 12:49 after picking up the rebound of Basil McRae 's slap shot from the slot . Janney set up McRae for the shot , and the puck sailed wide of the net and bounced off the end boards to Felsner . Felsner sticked the rebound into the partially open net . The Blues outshot the Hawks 10-5 in the second period . With the Blackhawks leading 3-2 at 9:56 of the third , Stephane Matteau picked up a high sticking penalty . Just 53 seconds into the power play , Steve Smith was called for slashing , giving the Blues a 5-on-3 advantage for 1:07 . The Blues did n't waste time as Brendan Shanahan scored just 23 seconds into the two-man advantage to tie the game 3-3 . Janney found Hull in the slot , and Hull fired a rocket at Belfour . Jeff Brown collected the rebound and passed it to Shanahan in the left circle . Shanahan beat Belfour from a sharp angle . Just 17 seconds later , Hull scored the game winner for the Blues . Nelson Emerson broke in on right wing , carried the puck behind the net along with two Hawks defensemen . Emerson made a nice pass to an unchecked Hull in the slot , and Hull beat Belfour to put the Blues up 4-3 . The Hawks had several chances to tie the game in the final minutes , but Joseph made some brilliant saves to prevent the Hawks from scoring . He stopped Troy Murray point blank from just right of the crease with 2:30 left in the game . The Blues killed off a late Hawks power play , with Rich Sutter clearing the puck with his hand as it was trickling along the goal line . The Blues held on to win the game . The Hawks oushot the Blues 13-7 in the third period , totaling 27 shots on goal for each team . The Blues special teams were excellent in the game . The Blues killed 6 of 7 Hawks power plays , and scored twice on on four power play chances . The Blues ranked among the best special teams in the league . They rank 2nd in penalty killing and 3rd on the power play . The game was carried live on ABC , the first time an NHL game other than an All-Star game has been shown on network television since May 24 , 1980 , when CBS carried Game 6 of the Stanley Cup finals .

From : ndallen @ r-node.hub.org ( Nigel Allen ) Subject : WACO : Clinton press conference , part 1 Organization : R-node Public Access Unix - 1 416 249 5366 Lines : 282 Here is a press release from the White House . President Clinton 's Remarks On Waco With Q/A To : National Desk Contact : White House Office of the Press Secretary , 202-456-2100 WASHINGTON , April 20 -- Following are remarks by President Clinton in a question and answer session with the press : 1:36 P.M. EDT THE PRESIDENT : On February the 28th , four federal agents were killed in the line of duty trying to enforce the law against the Branch Davidian compound , which had illegally stockpiled weaponry and ammunition , and placed innocent children at risk . Because the BATF operation had failed to meet its objective , a 51-day standoff ensued . The Federal Bureau of Investigation then made every reasonable effort to bring this perilous situation to an end without bloodshed and further loss of life . The Bureau 's efforts were ultimately unavailing because the individual with whom they were dealing , David Koresh , was dangerous , irrational , and probably insane . He engaged in numerous activities which violated both federal law and common standards of decency . He was , moreover , responsible for the deaths and injuries which occurred during the action against the compound in February . Given his inclination towards violence and in an effort to protect his young hostages , no provocative actions were taken for more than seven weeks by federal agents against the compound . This weekend I was briefed by Attorney General Reno on an operation prepared by the FBI , designed to increase pressure on Koresh and persuade those in the compound to surrender peacefully . The plan included a decision to withhold the use of ammunition , even in the face of fire , and instead to use tear gas that would not cause permanent harm to health , but would , it was hoped , force the people in the compound to come outside and to surrender . I was informed of the plan to end the siege . I discussed it with Attorney General Reno . I asked the questions I thought it was appropriate for me to ask . I then told her to do what she thought was right , and I take full responsibility for the implementation of the decision . Yesterday 's action ended in a horrible human tragedy . Mr. Koresh 's response to the demands for his surrender by federal agents was to destroy himself and murder the children who were his captives , as well as all the other people who were there who did not survive . He killed those he controlled , and he bears ultimate responsibility for the carnage that ensued . Now we must review the past with an eye towards the future . I have directed the United Stated Departments of Justice and Treasury to undertake a vigorous and thorough investigation to uncover what happened and why , and whether anything could have been dne differently . I have told the departments to involve independent professional law enforcement officials in the investigation . I expect to receive analysis and answers in whatever time is required to complete the review . Finally , I have directed the departments to cooperate fully with all congressional inquiries so that we can continue to be fully accountable to the American people . I want to express my appreciation to the Attorney General , to the Justice Department , and to the federal agents on the front lines who did the best job they could under deeply difficult circumstances . Again , I want to say as I did yesterday , I am very sorry for the loss of life which occurred at the beginning and at the end of this tragedy in Waco . I hope very much that others who will be tempted to join cults and to become involved with people like David Koresh will be deterred by the horrible scenes they have seen over the last seven weeks . And I hope very much that the difficult situations which federal agents confronted there and which they will be doubtless required to confront in other contexts in the future will be somewhat better handled and better understood because of what has been learned now . Q Mr. President , can you , first of all , tell us why , after 51 days , you decided -- Q Mr. President , can you describe for us what it is that Janet Reno outlined to you in your 15-minute phone conversation with -- THE PRESIDENT : I ca n't hear you both . If one will go first and then the other . Q Sorry . Can you describe what Janet Reno -- Q Mr. President -- THE PRESIDENT : I 'll answer both your questions , but I ca n't do it at once . Q Can you describe what she told you on Sunday about the nature of the operation and how much detail you knew about it ? THE PRESIDENT : Yes . I was told by the Attorney General that the FBI strongly felt that the time had come to take another step in trying to dislodge the people in the compound . And she described generally what the operation would be -- that they wanted to go in and use tear gas which had been tested not to cause permanent damage to adults or to children , but which would make it very difficult for people to stay inside the building . And it was hoped that the tear gas would permit them to come outside . I was further told that under no circumstances would our people fire any shots at them even if fired upon . They were going to shoot the tear gas from armored vehicles which would protect them and there would be no exchange of fire . In fact , as you know , an awful lot of shots were fired by the cult members at the federal officials . There were no shots coming back from the government side . I asked a number of questions . The first question I asked is , why now ? We have waited seven weeks ; why now ? The reasons I was given were the following : Number one , that there was a limit to how long the federal authorities could maintain with their limited resources the quality and intensity of coverage by experts there . They might be needed in other parts of the country . Number two , that the people who had reviewed this had never seen a case quite like this one before , and they were convinced that no progress had been made recently and no progress was going to be made through the normal means of getting Koresh and the other cult members to come out . Number three , that the danger of their doing something to themselves or to others was likely to increase , not decrease , with the passage of time . And number four , that they had reason to believe that the children who were still inside the compound were being abused significantly , as well as being forced to live in unsanitary and unsafe conditions . So for those reasons , they wanted to move at that time . The second question I asked the Attorney General is whether they had given consideration to all of the things that could go wrong and evaluated them against what might happen that was good . She said that the FBI personnel on the scene and those working with them were convinced that the chances of bad things happening would only increase with the passage of time . The third question I asked was , has the military been consulted ? As soon as the initial tragedy came to light in Waco , that 's the first thing I asked to be done , because it was obvious that this was not a typical law enforcement situation . Military people were then brought in , helped to analyze the situation and some of the problems that were presented by it . And so I asked if the military had been consulted . The Attorney General said that they had , and that they were in basic agreement that there was only one minor tactical difference of opinion between the FBI and the military -- something that both sides thought was not of overwhelming significance . Having asked those questions and gotten those answers , I said that if she thought it was the right thing to do , that she should proceed and that I would support it . And I stand by that today . Q Mr. President -- THE PRESIDENT : Wait . Go ahead . Q Can you address the widespread perception -- reported widely , television , radio and newspapers -- that you were trying somehow to distance yourself from this disaster ? THE PRESIDENT : No , I 'm bewildered by it . The only reason I made no public statement yesterday -- let me say -- the only reason I made no public statement yesterday is that I had nothing to add to what was being said and I literally did not know until rather late in the day whether anybody was still alive other than those who had been actually seen and taken to the hospital or taken into custody . It was purely and simply a question of waiting for events to unfold . There was -- I have -- I ca n't account for why people speculated one way or the other , but I talked to the Attorney General on the day before the action took place . I talked to her yesterday . I called her again late last night after she appeared on the Larry King Show , and I talked to her again this morning . A President -- it is not possible for a President to distance himself from things that happen when the federal government is in control . I will say this , however . I was , frankly , surprised would be a mild word , to say that anyone that would suggest that the Attorney General should resign because some religious fanatics murdered themselves . ( Applause . ) I regret what happened , but it is not possible in this life to control the behavior of others in every circumstance . These people killed four federal officials in the line of duty . They were heavily armed . They fired on federal officials yesterday repeatedly , and they were never fired back on . We did everything we could to avoid the loss of life . They made the decision to immolate themselves . And I regret it terribly , and I feel awful about the children . But in the end , the last comment I had from Janet Reno , is when -- and I talked to her on Sunday -- I said , now , I want you to tell me once more why you believe -- not why they believe -- why you believe we should move now rather than wait some more . And she said , it 's because of the children . They have evidence that those children are still being abused and that they 're in increasingly unsafe conditions , and that they do n't think it will get any easier with time -- with the passage of time . I have to take their word for that . So that is where I think things stand . Q Can we assume then that you do n't think this was mishandled in view of the outcome , that you did n't run out of patience ? And if you had it to do over again , would you really decide that way ? THE PRESIDENT : No -- well , I think what you can assume is just exactly what I announced today . This is a -- the FBI has done a lot of things right for this country over a long period of time . This is the same FBI that found the people that bombed the World Trade Center in lickety-split , record time . We want an inquiry to analyze the steps along the way . Is there something else we should have known ? Is there some other question they should have asked ? Is there some other question I should have asked ? Can I say for sure that no one -- that we could have done nothing else to make the outcome come different ? I do n't know that . That 's why I want the inquiry and that 's why I would like to make sure that we have some independent law enforcement people , not political people , but totally non-political , outside experts who can bring to bear the best evidence we have . There is , unfortunately , a rise in this sort of fanaticism all across the world . And we may have to confront it again . And I want to know whether there is anything we can do , particularly when there are children involved . But I do think it is important to recognize that the wrong-doers in this case were the people who killed others and then killed themselves . Q Mr. President , were there any other options presented to you for resolving this situation at any point from February 28th until yesterday ? THE PRESIDENT : Well , yes , I got regular reports all along the way . There were lots of other options pursued . If you go back -- you all covered it very well . The FBI -- you did a very good job of it . I mean , the FBI and the other authorities there pursued any number of other options all along the way , and a lot of them early on seemed to be working . Some of the children got out , some of the other people left . There was a -- at one point , there seemed to be some lines of communication opening up between Koresh and the authorities . And then he would say things and not do them and things just began to spin downward . Whether there were other -- in terms of what happened yesterday , the conversation I had with the Attorney General did not involve other options except whether we should take more time with the present strategy we were pursuing -- because they said they wanted to do this , because they thought this was the best way to get people out of the compound quickly before they could kill themselves . That 's what they thought . Q Did the government know that the children did not have gas masks ? Q congressional hearings once the situation -- are you in agreement with that ? THE PRESIDENT : That 's up to the Congress . They can do whatever they want . But I think it 's very important that the Treasury and Justice Departments launch this investigation and bring in some outside experts . And as I said in my statement , if any congressional committees want to look into it , we will fully cooperate . There is nothing to hide here . This was probably the most well-covered operation of its kind in the history of the country . ( more , more ) -30-

From : xx155 @ yfn.ysu.edu ( Family Magazine Sysops ) Subject : THE EMPTY TOMB ... Reply-To : xx155 @ yfn.ysu.edu ( Family Magazine Sysops ) Organization : St. Elizabeth Hospital , Youngstown , OH Lines : 218 THE EMPTY TOMB : CAN WE TRUST IT ? by the late Wilbur M. Smith , D.D . ( 1894-1977 ) When Jesus was on Earth , He made an amazing prediction about Himself , and frequently repeated it . Let me quote it for you : Behold , we go up to Jerusalem ; and the Son of Man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes , and they shall condemn Him to death , and shall deliver Him to the Gentiles to mock , and to scourge , and to crucify Him ; and the third day He shall rise again '' ( Matthew 20:18-19 ) . Wholly different from the normal experience of men , Jesus , who had *never* done anything worthy of death , even deserving reproval , knew He would die before He was 40 years of age . He knew the very city where He would die . He knew that the religious leaders of His own race would condemn Him to death . He knew that one of His own would betray Him . He knew that before His actual death took place He would be mocked and scourged . He knew exactly how He would die -- *by crucifixion . * All this is in itself remarkable . But more amazing than the minute particulars of His foreknowledge was what He predicted would follow shortly after He was buried -- *that He would rise again . * He even designated the time -- on the third day . But since it is on this central fact -- the death and resurrec- tion of Jesus Christ -- that the whole truth or untruth of Chris- tianity turns , let us examine it more closely . The body of Jesus was embalmed in long sheets of cloth between the layers of which a great abundance of spices and ointments was distributed . The body was placed in a tomb which had never before been used , and a great stone was rolled against the entrance . The Jewish authorities , fully aware that Jesus had predicted He would rise again , had the stone officially sealed and on Saturday placed a guard before the tomb to prevent the disciples from carrying away the body . Early Sunday morning some of the women who were faithful followers of Christ went out to the tomb to further anoint the body . To their utter astonishment , they found the stone rolled away , the body gone . They rushed back to tell the disciples . Shortly two of Jesus ' friends , Peter and John , utterly skeptical about the whole affair , came and found the tomb empty , just as the women had said . Even the guards came hurrying into the city to tell the Sanhedrin that had hired them to guard the tomb that the body was gone ( Matthew 28:11 ) . How did this tomb become empty ? One of the most famous New Testament scholars in America -- professor of New Testament literature in a large theological seminary -- wrote to the author in answer to my question of *how* the tomb became empty , and wrote it in a letter *not* marked by bitterness or sarcasm , that he could no more explain how the tomb became empty than he could explain how Santa Claus comes down the chimney at Christmas time . But he did n't realize that Santa Clause never did come down any chimney at Christmas time , *because there never was a Santa Claus ! * ... And there *is* a Jesus . He died ; He was buried in the tomb of Joseph of Arimathea , and on Sunday the body was gone . Those are facts of history . No one can escape the responsi- bility of coming to some conclusion about what really happened by mentioning a myth we all abandoned before we were eight years old . Another professor , Dr. Kirsopp Lake of Harvard University , tried to explain the empty tomb by saying ( what no other scholar in the field of New Testament criticism has ventured to adopt ) that the women went to the wrong tomb . The facts are these : First , so far as we know , there was no other tomb nearby to which by mistake they could have gone . Second , it is contrary to all similar experience for three or more people to forget the place where they have buried their dearest loved one within less than three days . Even if the women did miss the tomb , when Peter and John came , did they too go to the wrong tomb ? Third , were the soldiers *guarding* the wrong tomb ? There is , of course , a record of an attempt to escape the evidence of the empty tomb in the New Testament itself . Now when they were going , behold , some of the watch came into the city and showed unto the chief priests all the things that were done . And when they were assembled with the leaders and had taken counsel , they gave large money unto the soldiers , Saying , Say ye , His disciples came by night , and stole Him away while we slept . And if this come to the governor 's ears , we will persuade him , and secure you . So they took the money , and did as they were taught : and this saying is com- monly reported among the Jews until this day ( Matthew 28:11-15 ) . This is a good illustration of many later attempts to escape the fact that the tomb was empty . You will notice at once that the chief priests and the elders never questioned but that the tomb *was* empty . They never even went out to see if what the guards had reported was true -- they *knew* it was true . Another fact about this story makes it ridiculous to maintain that the tomb was empty -- the soldiers were told to say that Jesus ' disciples came and stole the body away *while they* ( the soldiers ) *were asleep ! * How could they know what was going on while they were asleep ? Obviously , such testimony would be valueless in any court . Even aside from the shallowness and sordidness that make us reject the explanation , the very character and the later history of the disciples compel us to believe they did not steal and secretly carry away the body of Jesus . First , as Professor Heffern points out , the leaders of Judaism in Jerusalem , who had put the Lord Jesus to death , had nothing to offer to contradict these disciples as they continued to preach Jesus and His resurrection -- because all Jerusalem knew the tomb was empty . If there had been trickery here , sooner or later it would have been suspected , then proved . Second , surely *one* of the disciples , even *most* of them , would have confessed the fraud under the terrific persecution they underwent . It may be possible to live a lie , but men seldom die for a lie -- and most of these men did . The result ultimately would have been that the message that Christ had risen would have suffered the fate of all such unfounded stories -- it would have lost it *power . * Instead , this truth swept the world , closed pagan temples , won millions of disciples , brought hope to a despairing humanity , was the very foundation truth of the early church , and is today as believable and as freshly glorious as ever . But not only did Jesus come alive again , He did not disappear to leave the disciples speculating through all the subsequent days as to what had happened to Him . Instead , He appeared to them -- literally , visibly , frequently . He appeared to the women at the tomb on Resurrection morning ( Matthew 28:1-10 ) ; later that day to Mary Magdalene alone ( John 20:11- 18 ) ; and to Simon Peter , also alone ( Luke 24:34 ) . In the afternoon He walked with two of His followers toward Emmaus ( Luke 24:13-35 ) ; and that night He appeared to ten of the apostles gathered together in an upper room at Jerusalem ( Mark 16:14-16 ; Luke 24:36-40 ; etc. ) . A week later He appeared to all eleven of the apostles , probably at the same place ( John 20:26-28 ) . Once He was seen by above 500 brethren on a mountain in Galilee ( I Corinthians 15:6 ) ; and finally to the apostles just before His ascension ( Mark 16:19 ; Luke 24:50-52 ; Acts 1:3- 8 ) . As with the fact of the empty tomb , so in regard to these histor- ically recorded appearances , all kinds of theories have been proposed attempting to deny their literalness . But these theories are unreasonable , without supporting evidence . None has ever won the unanimous approval of those who refuse to believe in the reality of the appearances . Moreover , while it is true we are living in an age when may of our leading scientists and agnostics and many of our philosophers are antisuperanaturalistic , let us not forget that some of the greatest thinkers of the ages have firmly believed in this great miracle . Increase Mather , president of Harvard ; Timothy Dwight , president of Yale ; Nathan Lord , president of Dartmouth ; Edward Hitchcock , president of Amherst ; Mark Hopkins , president of Williams ; John Witherspoon , president of Princeton -- these men and countless others have believed it . But suppose Christ *did* rise from the dead , what of it ? What has it to do with *my* life ? What has it to do with *your* life ? Just this : it seals with certitude the teachings of Christ . Jesus taught many great truths -- especially many about Himself . He claimed to have come down *from* God . He said He was the way *to* God . He said He was the Son of God , who alone knew God perfectly . He said that whoever believed on Him had eternal life , and no one else had it . He said that whatever we ask God in His name , He would grant it to us . Thus when He did rise from the grave on the third day , He revealed that in these amazing , unparalleled predictions , *He spoke the truth ! * Do you know any reason , *any good reason , * why we should not believe that His words are all true ? The point is , does not the truth of the Resurrection convince us that He is none other than the One He claimed to be -- the Son of God ? And then , of course , the fact that Christ rose from the dead testifies that He has broken the power of death , and that He will some day raise us also up from the grave , as He promised . In other words , if this Person , Jesus Christ , the Son of God , in all this , He should be the cornerstone of the foundation of your life . For He said a life built on Him would know forgiveness of sins , His compan- ionship and help , a joy that no circumstances can ever take away , and a hope that shineth more and more unto a perfect day . Those who have tried it down through the ages -- *and there have been many* -- have given their testimony . And we today who believe also know .

This assumes that the Feds are tapping Clipper phones belonging to ordinary citizens ( getting such a phone is the whole point of the crime under discussion ) .

For a good discussion of cryptographically `` good '' random number generators , check out the draft-ietf-security-randomness-00.txt Internet Draft , available at your local friendly internet drafts repository . A reasonably source of randomness is the output of a cryptographic hash function ( e.g. , MD5 ) , when fed with a large amount of more-or-less random data . For example , running MD5 on /dev/mem is a slow , but random enough , source of random bits ; there are bound to be 128 bits of entropy in the tens ( or hundreds ) of megabytes of data in a modern workstation 's memory , as a fair amount of them are system timers , i/o buffers , etc . /ji

But I am still pretty pissed of at the local ABC coverage . They cut off the first half hour of coverage by playing David Brinkley at 12:30 instead of an earlier time slot . I don't even understand their problem . If they didnt think enough people would not watch the game why would they decide to show most of the game ? And if they showed the remaining 2.5 hours of the game , would it hurt to play David Brinkley at its regular time ? They dont have any decent programming before noon anyway . I called the sports dept and blasted them on their machine . I called gain and someone picked it up . When I asked him why they premepted the first half hour of the Stanley Cup playoffs , he seemed a bit confused . When I explained a bit more in detail , he then said that 's upto to our programming dept . call back on Monday . weel , I understand that the sports dept is not responsible for this preemption . BUt I ca n't understand how someone in the sports dept . ca n't even recognise the name of playoffs shown on the very same station he works for .

Alas , this is not provable . I think that that > there are actually *few* cases where this is so . excerpted from a letter I wrote a while ago : Although less apparent to those who have not researched the facts , personal protection is as legitimate a reason as sport for the private citizen to own a gun . The most recent research is that of Dr. Gary Kleck of the Florida State University School of Criminology.1 He found that handguns are more often used by victims to defeat crime than by criminals to commit it ( 645,000 vs. 580,000 respectively in this study ) . These figures are even more encouraging when you consider the number of crimes that never occur because of the presence of a gun in the hands of a law-abiding private citizen . In a National Institute of Justice study of ten state prisons across the country they found that 39 % of the felons surveyed had aborted at least one crime because they believed that the intended victim was armed. , and 57 % agreed that `` most criminals are more worried about meeting an armed victim than they are about running into the police . `` 2 One of the most heinous of crimes is that against the women of this country . It has been my recent observation that more women are purchasing handguns for defense in response to the present danger of these assaults . This should be taken as encouraging news if the events of Orlando Florida are any indicator . In the late 1960 's the female populace was plagued with a series of brutal assaults ; just the publicity of the record number of women buying guns and obtaining training resulted in an 88 % decrease in rape for that area , the only city of its size in the country to experience a decrease of crime for that year . Additionally , a 1979 US Justice Department study of 32,000 attempted rapes showed that overall , when rape is attempted , the completion rate is 36 % . But when a woman defends herself with a gun , the completion rate drops to 3 % . 1 G Kleck , Point Blank : Guns and Violence in America Aldine de Gruyter , NY , 1991 2 JD Wright & PH Rossi Armed and Considered Dangerous : A Survey of Felons and Their Firearms , Aldine de Gruyter , NY , 1986 -- -- -- - __________________________________________________________________________ [ unlike cats ] dogs NEVER scratch you when you wash them .

It would be interesting for Apple to come out with a NuBus PowerPC that allowed use of the CPU 's 680x0 , like RocketShare . But I guess that 's getting a bit fantastic ! I was wondering , since MacWeek reported that developers were 'seeded ' with PowerPCs on a NuBus card . Also , any word on machine arrivals or estimated speed ?

Ave. , Cambridge , MA 02139 , USA +1 ( 617 ) 876-3296 Lines : 581 NNTP-Posting-Host : life.ai.mit.edu THE WHITE HOUSE Office of the Press Secretary _____________________________________________________________________ For Immediate Release April 5 , 1993 PRESS BRIEFING BY GEORGE STEPHANOPOLOUS The Briefing Room 10:10 A.M. EDT MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : As you know , the President is soon to be on his way , on Amtrack to Camden Yards . He 'll be throwing out the first pitch . Q It 's MARC , the Maryland Area Transit , it 's not Amtrack . MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Oh , it 's not Amtrack ? Well , he 's going from Union Station , you 're right . Excuse me . Q George , what exactly are you prepared to do to break the logjam with ? ? ? Senate ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Well , as you know , there are discussions between Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole this morning , and I think that the President is going to continue to make the point that he believes that our investment package , our jobs package needs to be passed as quickly as possible . We need this investment for summer jobs , for immunization , for highway construction , for the important programs that will put people back to work right away this summer . And the President continues to believe his program should be passed . Q Will he compromise , that 's the question ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Well , as you know , the discussions are going on this morning in the Senate betwen Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole , let 's see what they come up with . But the President believes his jobs program should go forward . Q George , would the President be willing to accept $ 8 billion for one year , which apparently appears to be the compromise being offered by -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Well , I do n't know what is being offered by either side . The Senate discussions are going on right now , let 's see what happens today . Q Would he go that far -- no matter what the Republicans have offered so far , would he go that far , $ 8 billion per year ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : The President believes that his program should be passed at this time . Clearly , we 're going to be willing to listen to what the Senators might or might not be able to come up with , but I 'm not going to get into figures right now . Let 's see what happens . Q It 's reasonable to assume , is n't it , from what has happened so far that a compromise is going to be necessary in order to get a vote ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Well , the Republicans seem more intrested in stopping progress on the President 's jobs bill , than in doing something to create -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Well , the Republicans seem more interested in stopping progress on the President 's jobs bill than in doing something to create real action , real jobs this summer for the American people . I think there 's no question about that . There 's been some frustration of legislative activity over the last few days . Q So , you 'll need to compromise to get your package through ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : We 'll see what happens with the conversations between Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole this morning . Q prepared to compromise -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : The President 's prepared to listen to what Senator Mitchell has to say this morning after his meeting with Senator Dole . Q Does he feel that he has been defeated in his -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Not in the least . In fact , he 's been very successful so far in the beginning of his term . Q How ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : He passed his budget in record time , in six weeks , and it 's a budget which reduces the deficit by $ 500 billion over five years . And it 's a budget which provides for important investments in our future . Right now we 've also had strong passage of his jobs program through the House . Simply because a minority of Republicans in the Senate choose to perpetuate gridlock and hold up action on the President 's jobs program is not a sign that he is not succeeding overall . Q He ca n't beat this , can he ? Q The fact is they can do that ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Well , the Republicans can stop action . There 's no question about that . Q What are you going to do about it ? Q George , what do you know about these alleged notes taken by Boris Yeltsin during one of the meetings in which it appears that the President told Boris Yeltsin not to trust the Japanese ; that when they say yes they mean no ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I think that 's a complete misreading of what happened at the meeting . The context of the conversation was that President Clinton was actually reassuring President Yeltsin at the time about his conversations with Prime Minister Miyazawa over the Kuril Islands and the Prime Minister 's belief that Japan would play a constructive role in the G-7 process . I mean this was a casual comment about Japanese courtesy and etiquette but overall it was in the context of a conversation where he was reassuring President Yeltsin that he believed the Japanese were serious about their commitment to the G-7 process . Q Are you saying that the President said that when the Japanese say yes they mean no ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : That 's not -- I do n't know the exact words and there was a much longer discussion about he did say something along the lines that he believes that on this issue Prime Minister Miyazawa intends to really go forward with the G-7 process . Q Have there been any attempts to explain this to the Japanese because apparently the Japanese press has picked this up and there appears to be -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I 've seen the reports in the Japanese press and it actually does put the situation in context . It does talk about the Japanese -- understanding the Japanese points of view . I do n't think it 's going to be a problem . I believe that there may have been some diplomatic context just to clear things up but I 'm not positive . Q George , was the specific comment that was made specific to the Kuril Island situation or was it a general observation on Japanese etiquette ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : The discussion was about -- Q The specific comment is what I 'm asking about that has alleged to have been translated from the Russian notes , `` when the Japanese say yes they mean no . '' MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Well , it was a combination . I mean I do n't think that 's the whole sentence . I think that the specific comment was a broad , general observation followed up by a specific finish to the sentence where he said in this case he believes that Prime Minister Miyazawa means to keep the commitment . Q Was he saying it facetiously first ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I think it was just a casual observation . Q And then you say diplomatic contacts were made to clear it up . Has the President sent a message ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : No , I do n't think the President spoke ; I believe that Secretary Christopher has made some calls but I 'm not sure exactly how many . Q Well , this obviously is a bigger deal than you 're making it out to be if Christopher has had to make some calls . MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : No , no . It was just that we got the reports in Vancouver and the Secretary wanted to make sure that it was understood and make sure there was absolutely no MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : -- reports in Vancouver , and the Secretary wanted to make sure that it was understood , and make sure there is absolutely no misunderstanding , and I do n't believe there is on . Q What is our position about the Japanese ? That they may have to say one thing , but actualy mean another ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : No . The position on the Japanese is as the President stated to President Yeltsin throughout the two days . He said that he had had a good conversation with Prime Minister Miazawa prior to the Summit . He reiterated the U.S. position , the long-standing support for the Japanese position on the Kuril Islands , but also reiterated Prime Minister Miazawa 's commitment to move forward on the G-7 process and to play a constructive role . And I think President Yeltsin was very glad to hear that . Q After listening to Secretary Christopher on Iraq for the last few days , I 'm a little confused . What is the U.S. policy ? Do you want to see Saddam Hussein overturned ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : It 's the same policy that Secretary Christopher has reiterated , and all of the U.S officials have reiterated . We expect full and complete and unequivocal compliance with all U.N. resolutions . Right now we do not have that compliance . Q throwing it out further that if Iraq complies , Saddam ca n't stay in office ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Right . I think that that 's -- our judgment is that it is not possible for Saddam Hussein to comply with the resolutions and stay in power . But the important point is that we expect compliance by Iraq with all U.N. resolutions , and we will continue to demand it . Q And are you concerned the Iran will become the dominant power in the area -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Secretary Christopher has also spoken to Iran over the last several days , and he says we also expect full Iranian compliance with all international norms , and stopping support of terrorism . Q That 's a very glib statement that he wo n't stay in power if he complies with U.N. resolutions . On what logic do you base that ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Right now Saddam Hussein is not complying with the U.N. resolutions at all . He is not respecting the rights of his people , as is required by the U.N. resolution . He is not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding inspections . He is not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding armaments . Q Well , when do you think that if he did comply he would be out of power ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Well , right now his power rests on the repression of his people . If he stopped doing that it would make it more difficult for him to stay in power . Q George , back on the stimulus package , why is it that you and the President accuse the Republicans of playing pure politics and perpetuating gridlock ? Why is it that -- what evidence do you have that they just do n't have a genuine idealogical difference with you that 's in good faith ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Well , the fact that several times in the past the Republicans , many of the ones who are now leading the fight for the filibuster , have supported the very funding they now seek to stop , most especially , the highway funding . Q George , in regards to that , some of the moderate Republicans said that the White House erred by not being more open to them during the -- while the plan was put together , that they had one , sort of , proforma meeting between the White House and the Senate Republicans , and that was it . Does the Administration look back and thinks perhaps it could have done a better job of working with some - - MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Well , I 'm not sure that it 's true that there was only one meeting . I mean , the President met with the Republican leadership on at least two occasions before the introduction of his package . He met with the entire Senate Republican Caucus also for lunch , and went up there . We are continually in contact with as many Republicans as we can find who have an interest in the President 's package . We are interested in what they have to say , as well . But we believe that this program is important , and we 're going to continue to fight for it . Q your all or nothing , do it with the Democrats alone strategy , did you maybe miscalculate the ability to get it through ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Well , I mean , I think that there is no question that under the Senate rules a determined minority can frustrate activity . I mean , there is just no question about that . You only need 40 plus one to keep going . 40 plus one to keep going and to stop any action , and that 's what the Republicans are doing . Q going to rethink the way you attempt to get other things passed as you go through this process for the rest of the summer ? Q work with Republicans and try to woo some Republicans into your camp ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I think we 're going to continue to look for the support of Republicans whenever we can get it on the President 's intiatives ? Q But on this one -- how are you going to do it differently than you did it on this one because on this one you really did stiff the Republicans from the beginning and made it clear that it was a Democratic majority that would get this through and could get it through and you really did n't need Republican votes ? Are you going to take a different tack when you have to go for particular votes ? When you have to go through -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I ca n't see into the future and understand every possible turn in the legislative road . Clearly the President 's going to continue to reach out when he can . Q You do n't have any regrets then about the way you have handled it up to now and you do n't plan any changes in your approach in dealing with the Republicans in Congress based on this experience ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Obviously the President would like his package passed as quickly as possible and he 's going to continue to press for that . We will continue to reach out to Republicans , there 's not question about that . And we 'll continue to reason with them and try and find appropriate avenues for cooperation . In this case the Republicans have chosen to unify around a filibuster , around a plan to frustrate action not a plan to move forward . Q They 're being denied any other legislative means of putting their proposals forward . MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I think they 're being -- Q any ideas . MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I think their amendments are being defeated ; I do n't know that they 're being denied . Q to present them . MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : That 's not exactly true . I mean they get the votes -- Q that theirs can be passed though by the parliamentary rules under which they 're playing . MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Unless they get a majority in support all the way around , no , that 's not exactly true . Q George , one more on Iraq . Is the administration backing any of the Iraqi opposition ? Grooming any new leadership ? Q backing any of the Iraqi -- leadership ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Oh , I -- again , we 're pressing for Iraqi compliance . I do n't know if we can get into the business of grooming leadership . I believe there have been some contacts , at some levels , with Iraqi opposition groups . I do n't know about anything recently . Q Jesse Jackson , who , of course , is not the President 's best friend , has , however , been told that there is to be some kind of town meeting , or some kind of involvement by the President , pre-empted the ball game -- Los Angeles . Will he consider something like that , or any other kind of intervention there ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Well , as you know , the President appointed Commerce Secretary Ron Brown , about 10 days ago , to be a special envoy to California , and coordiante cabinet activities around the California economic situation , including the situation in Los Angeles . I believe there will also be visits out to Los Angeles by the Education -- or have been visits by the Education Secretary , Mr. Riley . I believe that Transportation Secretary Pena and HUD Secretary Cisneros are also going out . And there may be other visits by Cabinet officials over the next several days and weeks . I would n't rule out the possibility of a visit by President Clinton to California . Obviously , he is following the situation closely , and is concerned about making sure that we make the right long term policy decisions that will help create the kind of economic opportunities which help prevent disturbances . But we 're going to continue to watch it . Q George , as a follow-up , Reverend Jackson is also supposed to be outside the ball park today , in Baltimore , with a group of supporters protesting the lack of minorities in baseball management . Does the President have a position on that ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : The President has received correspondence from Reverend Jackson . I know that Reverend Jackson has also spoken with the White House Chief of Staff , Mack McLarty . He clearly raises serious questions . There has been some progress in baseball over the last several years , but still not enough . But the President intends to continue to go to the ball game . Q Is he going to say anything about it today , or see Reverend Jackson while he 's out there ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I do n't know if he is going to see them , but as I said , the President believes that Reverend Jackson has raised some serious questions , and it 's something that , as I said , even though there has been progress , it 's clearly not enough . Q Did Reverend Jackson ask him not to go to the ball game ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I 'm not sure about that . I believe the characterization the Reverend Jackson is talking about is an informational pickett . I do n't know that he asked him not to go to the ball game , but he sent a long , detailed , formal letter outlining his concerns with the situation in major league baseball and the President read it . Q George , the Orioles are playing the Rangers , the managing partner of the Rangers is George W. Bush . Is he going to be there , and is he going to meet with the President ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I do n't know . Q What is the Mubarak schedule ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I know that President Mubarak is coming tomorrow morning for a working meeting , they will have a lunch , and I believe that he is having dinner tonight with Vice President Gore . Q And joint statements tomorrow -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I believe so , yes . At the end , yes . Q Is there evidence , George , that the Egyptians did warn the U.S. about a potential terrorist bombing -- terrorist activities ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : As reported in The New York Times , I mean , I think that President Mubarak did say that there has been general conversations with the Egyptians , as there have been for a long period of time . We do have general intelligence sharing , I mean . But President Mubarak was very careful to point out that there was no specific information on this visit that was passed forward . The President will continue to investigate the situation , but he also reiterates his belief that we can not tolerate terrorism of any kind . Q George , he did make specific -- or the Egyptians , apparently , did issue specific warnings about this individual who , forgive me -- this individual who , forgive me the name escapes me at the moment , and said the Egyptians were more or less rebuffed in their attempts to get some kind of action . MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Again , I do n't know if I would agree with your characterization of the Mubarak interview . He did say that they gave general warnings about the possibility of a network in the United States and upon which we took appropriate action . But there was no specific information on this specific operation at all . Q So , the White House does n't feel that any of the law enforcement agencies whether it be the CIA or FBI who would have received this kind of information was lax or derelict in its duty in not pursuing some kind of -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : No , not at all . Q What 's next with Serbia ? It got only a passing mention in the news conference yesterday -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : You did n't get to ask your question . Q Yes , exactly . Was there any agreement on concerted action between the two countries ? And even if there was n't , what does the U.S. do next ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I think the U.S. is clearly going to move forward in the U.N. today continuing discussions with our allies on a sanctions resolution and we 'll continue to look for ways to press the Serbians to come to the negotiating table and sign an agreement . Q George , why do you think sanctions is still an option ? I mean the Serbians make it clear that at least the leadership is surviving just fine and they feel like they can wait you out and even the administration officials we had in the other day said there 's no evidence that they 're going to have an effect any time soon . The Bosnian Serbs have said no to the peace plan . When does no mean no and you have to do something different ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Well , I mean we are doing something different . We 're moving forward on further sanctions through the U.N. and those discussions will continue . We 're going to continue to try and tighten the noose on Serbia , and I think that every opportunity we have to do that will have an effect over time . Q Are we looking again at lifting the arms embargo ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : The President has said that this is something that is under consideration . Q George , do you have any more on Hugh Rodham 's condition , how he 's doing ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : As far as I know nothing 's changed . Q George , -- week after Mr. Mubarak ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : It 's a little unclear . I think we 'll be able to get you more either tonight or tomorrow morning after the Mubarak visit . Q Is he going somewhere for Easter ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Not that I know of . Q What more can you tell us about the additional aid to Russia that the President plans to ask Congress about ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : He 's going to be consulting with the Congress and with our G-7 partners over the next couple of weeks . I know that he spoke last evening with Congressman Gephardt and their delegation before the -- the congressional delegation meets with the Russians this week and those consultations will continue over the next several weeks . Q Do you expect that package to be of the magnitude of the one announced Sunday ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I 'm not going to discuss the magnitude . Q How about the list of Cold War restrictions , where do you stand on that -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : As the President said yesterday , he 's going to be looking for that list from the Congress this week and reviewing it . He believes -- he 's going to try and get it this week and he 's going to review the list , and we 're going to take a hard look at it . Q But they 're making it up ? I mean it 's no White House involvement , Congress is compiling this list ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I think he 's going to talk to the congressional leaders about compiling the list but I 'm certain we 'll be able to get our own researchers working as well . Q George , is n't lifting the arms embargo more of a probability than a possibility ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : It 's something that 's under discussion . Q Secretary Christopher has said that it 's a matter of time and -- for months before that happens . MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Again , all I can say is that it 's something that the President is reviewing . Right now we 're working with our allies in the U.N on a sanctions resolution , and we 'll continue to review other matters . Q George , can you tell us anything about the schedule this week ? Any travel ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : They just asked about that . I do n't have anything more beyond tomorrow 's visit with Mubarak right now . Q Are there consultations , George , with any Jewish American organizations concerning Jackson-Vanick ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : As you know the National Conference of Soviet Jewry has a list of , I believe , MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : -- as you know , the National Conference of Soviet Jewry has a list of , I believe , 200 Refuseniks . We 'll certainly take a look at that and continue appropriate discussions . Thanks . # # #

From : clipper @ csrc.ncsl.nist.gov ( Clipper Chip Announcement ) Subject : White House Public Encryption Management Fact Sheet Organization : National Institute of Standards & Technology Distribution : na Lines : 94 Note : The following was released by the White House today in conjunction with the announcement of the Clipper Chip encryption technology . FACT SHEET PUBLIC ENCRYPTION MANAGEMENT The President has approved a directive on `` Public Encryption Management . '' The directive provides for the following : Advanced telecommunications and commercially available encryption are part of a wave of new computer and communications technology . Encryption products scramble information to protect the privacy of communications and data by preventing unauthorized access . Advanced telecommunications systems use digital technology to rapidly and precisely handle a high volume of communications . These advanced telecommunications systems are integral to the infrastructure needed to ensure economic competitiveness in the information age . Despite its benefits , new communications technology can also frustrate lawful government electronic surveillance . Sophisticated encryption can have this effect in the United States . When exported abroad , it can be used to thwart foreign intelligence activities critical to our national interests . In the past , it has been possible to preserve a government capability to conduct electronic surveillance in furtherance of legitimate law enforcement and national security interests , while at the same time protecting the privacy and civil liberties of all citizens . As encryption technology improves , doing so will require new , innovative approaches . In the area of communications encryption , the U. S. Government has developed a microcircuit that not only provides privacy through encryption that is substantially more robust than the current government standard , but also permits escrowing of the keys needed to unlock the encryption . The system for the escrowing of keys will allow the government to gain access to encrypted information only with appropriate legal authorization . To assist law enforcement and other government agencies to collect and decrypt , under legal authority , electronically transmitted information , I hereby direct the following action to be taken : INSTALLATION OF GOVERNMENT-DEVELOPED MICROCIRCUITS The Attorney General of the United States , or her representative , shall request manufacturers of communications hardware which incorporates encryption to install the U.S. government-developed key-escrow microcircuits in their products . The fact of law enforcement access to the escrowed keys will not be concealed from the American public . All appropriate steps shall be taken to ensure that any existing or future versions of the key-escrow microcircuit are made widely available to U.S. communications hardware manufacturers , consistent with the need to ensure the security of the key-escrow system . In making this decision , I do not intend to prevent the private sector from developing , or the government from approving , other microcircuits or algorithms that are equally effective in assuring both privacy and a secure key- escrow system . KEY-ESCROW The Attorney General shall make all arrangements with appropriate entities to hold the keys for the key-escrow microcircuits installed in communications equipment . In each case , the key holder must agree to strict security procedures to prevent unauthorized release of the keys . The keys shall be released only to government agencies that have established their authority to acquire the content of those communications that have been encrypted by devices containing the microcircuits . The Attorney General shall review for legal sufficiency the procedures by which an agency establishes its authority to acquire the content of such communications . PROCUREMENT AND USE OF ENCRYPTION DEVICES The Secretary of Commerce , in consultation with other appropriate U.S. agencies , shall initiate a process to write standards to facilitate the procurement and use of encryption devices fitted with key-escrow microcircuits in federal communications systems that process sensitive but unclassified information . I expect this process to proceed on a schedule that will permit promulgation of a final standard within six months of this directive . The Attorney General will procure and utilize encryption devices to the extent needed to preserve the government 's ability to conduct lawful electronic surveillance and to fulfill the need for secure law enforcement communications . Further , the Attorney General shall utilize funds from the Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture Super Surplus Fund to effect this purchase .

Just the other day I heard a rumor that `` Serdar Argic '' ( aka Hasan Mutlu and Ahmed Cosar and ZUMABOT ) is not really a Turk at all , but in fact is an Armenian who is attempting to make any discussion of the massacres in Armenia of Turks so noise-laden as to make serious discussion impossible , thereby cloaking the historical record with a tremendous cloud of confusion .
From : fmg @ alpha.smi.med.pitt.edu ( Filip Gieszczykiewicz ) Subject : Scope questions Summary : What is [ a ] `` Storage scope '' Distribution : na Organization : Medical Informatics , Pittsburgh , PA USA Lines : 33 Greetings . I 've been seeing the word `` storage '' mentioned around oscilliscopes but I 'm curious , what does it mean ? If my life depended on it , I 'd say that it 's a scope that uses long-persistance phosphor to keep the successive taces on the screen for some unit of time - `` store '' them . Do I get to live ? Also , I 've been shopping for a decent , used , [ old ] scope since my Tek 514A ( portable ... NOT ! ) and my Heathkit O-1000 are all single trace and I need more ... like 2 or 3 and at least 50MHz ( maybe 100 ... ) During my shopping at hamfests etc . I 've run into the problem of `` old scope '' terminology . I can imagine what a `` mainframe '' and `` plug-in '' are but some things like the above `` storage '' , `` coax input '' ( Hey , where do I get a probe that fits this ? I had to fiddle with mine for a week before I got anything resembling `` a good trace '' - they all come with BNC connectors ! ) , `` unblanking '' ( huh ? ) , and , oh , just like my 514 manuals , MANY changes were made along the way to the schematic - scopes , even with IDENTICAL model numbers , have different ( better ? ) response/performance than others - how can I pick the better one ? Does the rule of the higher SN the better apply ?

Anyway , here 's how I see the Waco affair ; I 'd be interested in other peoples' interpretations ... 1 . Koresh and his people were basically minding their own business . 2 . Some weapons violations may have been committed and I would n't have disapproved of prosecuting him for those violations . However , I think the BATF was criminal for starting negotiations with a military style assault and for firing into a house where there were children and other noncombatants . 3 . I do n't see they could n't just leave a token guard on the place and wait the BDs out ; I do n't approve of the tear gas approach and , if it caused the fire to be started , I think the FBI agent responsible should spend 10-20 years in jail . 4 . However , if Koresh 's response to the tear gas was to kill everyone there , I hold him largely responsible for their deaths . don

Herein lies the key to this thread : Kindly note the difference in the responses . Ed ( and I ) are talking about knowing riding technique , while Mike is arguing knowing the physics behind it . It *is* possible to be taught the technique of countersteering ( ie : push the bar on the inside of the turn to go that way ) *without* having to learn all the fizziks about gyroscopes and ice cream cones and such as seen in the parallel thread . That stuff is mainly of interest to techno-motorcycle geeks like the readers of rec.motorcycles ; ^ ) , but does n't need to be taught to the average student learning c-steering . Mike does n't seem to be able to make the distinction . I know people who can carve circles around me who could n't tell you who Newton was . On the other hand , I know very intelligent , well-educated people who think that you steer a motorcycle by either : 1 ) leaning , 2 ) steering a la bicycles , or 3 ) a combination of 1 and 2 .

From : gideon @ otago.ac.nz ( Gideon King ) Subject : Should Christians fight ? / Justifiable war Organization : University of Otago Lines : 144 I posted this a couple of weeks ago , and it does n't seem to have appeared on the newsgroup , and I have n't had a reply from the moderator . We were having intermittent problems with our mail at the time . Please excuse me if you have seen this before ... Should Christians fight ? Last week Alastair posted some questions about fighting , and whether there are such things as `` justifiable wars '' . I have started looking into these things and have jotted down my findings as I go . I have n't answered all his questions yet , and I know what I have here is on a slightly different tack , but possibly I 'll be able to get into it more deeply later , and post some more info soon . Our duty to our neighbour : Do good to all men ( Gal 6:10 ) Love our neighbour as ourselves ( Matt 22:39 ) Act the part of the good Samaritan ( Luke 10 ) toward any who may be in trouble . We will therefore render every possible assistance to an injured man , and therefore should not be part of any organisation which causes people harm ( even medical corps of the army etc ) . Christians are by faith `` citizens of the commonwealth of Israel '' ( Ephesians 2:11-12 ) , and also recognise that `` God rules in the kingdoms of men '' , and therefore we should not be taking part in any of the struggles of those nations which we are not part of due to our faith . We are to be `` strangers and pilgrims '' amongst the nations , so we are just passing through , and not part of any nation or any national aspirations ( this can also be applied to politics etc , but that 's another story ) . We are not supposed to `` strive '' or `` resist evil '' ( even `` suffer yourselves to be defrauded '' ) it is therefore incosistent for us to strive to assist in preserving a state which Christ will destroy when he returns to set up God 's kingdom . Our duty to the state . `` Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar 's and unto God the things which be God 's '' ( Luke 20:25 ) . `` Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers . For there is no power but of God ; the powers that be are ordained of God . Whosoever resisteth the power , resisteth the ordinance of God '' ( Rom 13:1-2 ) . `` Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord 's sake ; whether it be to king as supreme ... for so is the will of God that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men '' ( 1 Pet 2:13-15 ) These scriptures make it clear that submission to the powers that be is a divine command , but it is equally clear from Acts 5:19-29 that when any ordinance of man runs counter to God 's law , we must refuse submission to it . The reason for this is that we are God 's `` bond servants '' and His service is our life 's task . An example of the type of thing is in Col 3:22-23 where bondservants were to `` work heartily as unto the Lord '' - so also we should work as if our boss was God - i.e . `` Pressed down , shaken together , and running over '' ... oops - a bit of a side track there ... In the contests between the nations , we are on God 's side - a side that is not fighting in the battle , but is `` testifying '' to the truth . When we believe in God and embrace His promises , we become `` fellow citizens with the Saints and of the Household of God '' , and are no longer interested in associations of the world . Think of this in relation to unions etc as well . Paul tells us to `` lay aside every weight '' that we may run `` the race that is set before us '' , and if we are wise , we will discard any association which would retard our progress - `` Thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ . No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life , that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier '' ( 2 Tim 2:3-4 ) . One of these entanglements he warns about is `` be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers '' . One of the obvious applications of this is marriage with unbelievers , but it also covers things like business partnerships and any other position where we may form a close association with any person or persons not believing the truth about God ( in this case the army ) . The principle comes from Deut 22:10 - remember that as well as them being different animals of different strengths , one was clean and one unclean under the law . These ideas are strongly stressed in 2 Cor 6:13-18 - I suggest you read this . The yoking also has another aspect - that of servitude , and Jesus says `` take my yoke upon you '' , so we are then yoked with Christ and can not be yoked with unbelievers . We have already seen that we are bondservants of Christ , and Paul says `` become not ye the bondservants of men ( 1 Cor 7:23 RV ) . An example from the Old Testament : the question is asked in 2 Chr 19:2 '' Shouldest thou help the ungodly ... ? '' . The situation here is a good example of what happens when you are yoked together with unbelievers . Jehoshaphat was lucky to escape with his life . Here are the facts : 1 . He had made an affinity with Ahab , who had `` sold himself to work wickedness before the Lord '' ( 1 Kings 21:25 ) . 2 . When asked by Ahab to form a military alliance , he had agreed and said '' I am as thou art , my people as thy people '' ( 1 Kings 22:4 ) - an unequal yoking . 3 . He sttod firm in refusing the advice of the false prophets and insisted on hearing the prophet of the Lord ( trying to do the right thing ) , he found that he was yoked and therefore could n't break away from the evil association he had made . God says to us `` Come out from among them and be ye separate , and touch not the unclean thing , and I will receive you and ye shall be my sons and daughters '' ( 2 Cor 6:17 ) . This is more or less what I have found out so far - I 'm still looking into it , as I do n't think I 've answered all the questions raised by Alastair yet . Heres a summary and a few things to think about : The Christian in under command . Obedience to this command is an essential factor in his relationship with Christ ( John 15:10,14 ) . Total dedication to this course of action is required ( Romans 12:1-2 ) . Disobedience compromises the close relationship between Christ and his followers ( 1 Pet 2:7-8 ) . We are to be separated to God ( Rom 6:4 ) . This involves a master-servant relationship ( Rom 6:12,16 ) . No man can serve two masters ( Matt 6:24,13,14 ) . All that is in the 'Kosmos ' is lust and pride - quite opposed to Gos ( 1 John 2:16 ) . Christs kingdom is not of this world ( i.e . not worldly in nature ) - if it was , his servants would fight to deliver him . If Christ is our master and he was not delivered by his servants because his kingdom was not of this world , then his servants can not possibly fight for another master . Strangers and pilgrims have no rights , and we can not swear allegiance to anyone but God . The servant of the Lord must not war but be gentle to all ( 2 Tim 2:24 ) - this does not just apply to war , but also to avoiding strife throughout our lives . There is a war to be waged , not with man 's weapons ( 2 Cor 10:3-4 ) , but with God 's armour ( Eph6:13-20 ) . I 'll probably post some more when I 've had time to look into things a bit further . -- Gideon King | Phone +64-3-479 8347 University of Otago | Fax +64-3-479 8529 Department of Computer Science | e-mail gideon @ farli.otago.ac.nz P.O .

Yep , science is best in determining how ; religions handle > | > why and who . > | > > > Rich , I am curious as to why you and others award custody of the baby to > theists and religion ? I hope I did n't award custody , Rich . I purposely used `` handle '' in order to avoid doing so - i.e. , that happens to be what religions do ( of course there are aberrations like `` scientific '' creationism ) . I used `` best '' in part to indicate that science currently has a time of it with why and who , so these domains are mostly ignored . I also attempted to be brief , which no doubt confused the matter . As an aside , for science I should have written `` how and when '' . Nobody seems to argue over what . > Are they [ theists , theologians ] any better equiped to investigate the `` who and > why '' than magicians , astrologers , housewives [ not being sexists ] , athiests or > agnostics . Seems to me that the answer would vary from individual to individual . I 'm not trying to be evasive on this , but from a societal perspective , religion works . On the other hand , sometimes it is abused and misused , and many suffer , which you know . But the net result seems positive , this from the anthropological perspective on human affairs . You might call me a neo-Fruedian insofar as I think the masses ca n't get along without religion . Not that generally they are incapable ; they just do n't , and for myriad reasons , but the main one seems to be the promise of immortality . Very seductive , that immortality . Therefore it seems that theologians are better equipped than the others you mention for dispensing answers to `` who and why '' . I suggest that this holds regardless of the `` truth '' in their answers to who and why simply because people believe . In the end , spiritual beliefs are just as `` real '' as scientific facts and explanation ( CAUTION TO SOME : DO NOT TAKE THIS OUT OF CONTEXT ) . > Do you suggest that the `` who and why '' will forever be closed to scientific > investigation ? No . In fact , I do n't think it is closed now , at least for some individuals . Is n't there a group of theoretical physicists who argue that matter was created from nothing in a Big Bang singularity ? This approach might presuppose an absence of who and why , except that it seems it could be argued that something had to be responsible for nothing ? Maybe that something doesn't have to be supernatural , maybe just mechanistic . But that 's a tough one for people today to grasp . In any case , theory without empirical data is not explanation , but then your question does not require data . In other words , I agree that theorizing ( within scientific parameters ) is just as scientific as explaining . So the answer is , who and why are not closed to scientists , but I sense that science in these realms is currently very inadequate . Data will be necessary for improvement , and that seems a long way off , if ever . Pretty convoluted here ; I hope I 've made sense . > It seems to me that 200 or so years ago , the question of the origin of life on > earth was not considered open to scientific enquiry . I agree generally . But I prefer to put it this way - the *questions* of how , when , who and why were not open to inquiry . During the Enlightenment , reason was reponsible for questioning the theological answers to how and when , and not , for the most part , who and why . Science was thus born out of the naturalists ' curiosity , eventually carting away the how and when while largely leaving behind the who and why . The ignorant , the selfish , the intolerant , and the arrogant , of course , still claim authority in all four domains . > | > Rich Fox , Anthro , Usouthdakota > Did like your discussion around AMHs , and I did figure out what AMH was from > your original post : - ) Much obliged . Funny how facts tend to muddle things , is n't it ?

Well , looking at the videos it seems that this fire started in various places at the same time , which would indicate that this was a planned action . I 'm sure FBI and BATF did n't *deliberately* start a possible fire , having a sniper kill Korresh would have been a far easier method . Looking at the careful operation , and use of tear gas that as I know do n't start fires , it is less likely that this was the case .

Did you know about that ? near teh Radio telescope observatory in West virginia , they have a 90 ? ? ? ? ? ? mile EMCON zone . Theoretically they can prevent you from running light AC motors , like air conditioners and Vacuums . In practice , they use it mostly to control large radio users .

GOD of the Bible has given us humans relativly little about how he intends to judge mankind . the first test is those who have beleived that Jesus Christ is the Son of GOD and that his death and resurrection was sufficent to serve justice for all the acts we commit that are wrong in the eyes of god , the bible calls this sin . for those who die before the end of the world/have already died it is more complicated to explain without lapsing in to cliche . God must judge people on the baasis of their works in this world . however there is no plus and minus system for GOD . he has declared that he can not tolerate spiritual imperfection , thus he can only based your worthiness to live with him on the wrong in your life . Good people , yes even Christians are going to constantly sin before GOD , The Christian hoever thanks GOD that Christ has given his life for his sin 's penalty . the proscribed punishment for sin is death , just as the proscribed punishment for robbery is time in jail . God then can not ask for anything but punishement for those sins . He does not want to condem . the Bible says in John 3:17 , that God did not send his son in to the word to condem it but that through him it might be saved . '' when i realize that i have sinned , and i do with painful regularity , i must approach GOD and ask him to not hold thew sin against me , i have that right and privlige only because of Christ . as for Jews they are promised that they must believe on the Messiah who would come , and dis come in Jesus of Nazereth . Muslims , i fear have been given a lie from the fater of lies , Satan . They need Christ as do us all . for those who do n't have that right , in the view of the bible they stand olone in their defense . are you going to hell ? i can not answer that for you . i can only say that perhaps it is eaiser to ask and answer how can i not go to Hell ? that step is much more rewarding . stan toney stoney @ oyster.smcm.edu my opinions are my own , you may borrow them p.s . stay in touch and keep asking questions not just to us but to God as well , he listens too .

Thank you . > > Richard Stoakley > rws2v @ uvacs.cs.Virginia.EDU The problem is not precisely defined above , but if you need to find the smallest convex polygon that encloses a given polygon , then you are seeking the convex hull of your original polygon . There are two ways to do this : use a somewhat tricky but by-now well examined linear-time algorithm that exploits the polygon boundary , or just feed the vertices of the original polygon to a convex hull routine and accept O ( n log n ) . Both methods are discussed in Preparata and Shamos , for example .

It would indeed be unfair for me to do anything but give him a passing grade ( and skip the letter grading ) , but he had simply been awful on ice this year , save for a bright spot or two , and even if he had been healthy , he would not be any more than the 3rd-string goalie . But Hayward was a classy individual , who also figured in on the Sharks ' first ever victory , the 3rd game of the season last year against the Calgary Flames . As he retires , the fans will remember what a good guy he was . # 30 JEFF HACKETT Season : 3rd Acquired : '91-92 , from N. Y. Islanders in expansion draft Grade : C Hackett , after ( deservedly ) winning the team MVP honors last season , simply wasted the year . Other than a few good spots ( 57 saves against Los Angeles , almost-shutout against Tampa Bay , etc . ) , Hackett , finishing with 85.6 % save percentage and a 5.28 GAA , watched his status go from the team 's # 1 goalie to bench decoration at the end of the season . He was expected , early , to carry the team along ; instead , he apparently became frustrated , but the an early injury that forced him to miss 12 games may have been a contributing factor , but upon return , he simply was n't up to the task . He may not return next year . # 31 WADE FLAHERTY Season : 1st ( still eligible as rookie ) Acquired : '91-92 , signed as undrafted free agent Grade : I ( A- ) It is pretty hard to evaluate a goaltender on just one game alone , thus the incomplete grade , but yet in the one start that he did get ( against the Calgary Flames ) , Flaherty was nothing but sharp for at least two periods . He started the season poorly in Kansas City , but finished strong , prompting the Blades' owner Ron Parker to comment that he should be a candidate for the IHL MVP honors . The upcoming IHL playoffs would be a major challenge for him as he tries to make it into the NHL ; last year , he was a capable backup for Arturs Irbe in the throughout the season and in the Turner Cup playoffs , picking up all-star honors along with Irbe ; now it 's time for him to show that he can share the job with Irbe next year , because with prospects Dan Ryder , Trevor Robins , and Scott Cashman coming along , if he does n't make it next year , he may not ever . # 32 ARTURS IRBE Season : 1st Acquired : '91-92 , from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade : B+ I may yet be overly critical of Irbe in a year that he clearly established that he 's a bona fide NHL goaltender , perhaps a bona fide # 1 goaltender . He has provided most of the little highlight footage that the Sharks team had , getting the team 's first ever shut-out against the Los Angeles Kings on December 26 . He has been fearless in and out of the net , aggressively playing the puck and making passes , reminding people of a young Ron Hextall ( except , of course , the goonism ) . Yet he still needs to develop more consistency , which is hard to do with such a bad defense in front of him , but if the Sharks are to challenge for a playoff spot next season , Irbe 's the key , as he demonstrated in being named as a star of the game 13 times in 32 starts . =============================================================================== GO CALGARY FLAMES !

JPEG ( pronounced `` jay-peg '' ) is a standardized image compression mechanism . JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group , the original name of the committee that wrote the standard . JPEG is designed for compressing either full-color or gray-scale digital images of `` natural '' , real-world scenes . It does not work so well on non-realistic images , such as cartoons or line drawings . JPEG does not handle black-and-white ( 1-bit-per-pixel ) images , nor does it handle motion picture compression . Standards for compressing those types of images are being worked on by other committees , named JBIG and MPEG respectively . JPEG is `` lossy '' , meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't quite identical to what you originally put in . The algorithm achieves much of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye , notably the fact that small color details are n't perceived as well as small details of light-and-dark . Thus , JPEG is intended for compressing images that will be looked at by humans . If you plan to machine-analyze your images , the small errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you , even if they are invisible to the eye . A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjusting compression parameters . This means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality . You can make *extremely* small files if you do n't mind poor quality ; this is useful for indexing image archives , making thumbnail views or icons , etc . etc . Conversely , if you are n't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting , you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied , and accept lesser compression . [ 2 ] Why use JPEG ? There are two good reasons : to make your image files smaller , and to store 24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data . Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images . Being able to compress a 2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time ! ( If you are comparing GIF and JPEG , the size ratio is more like four to one . More details below . ) If your viewing software does n't support JPEG directly , you 'll have to convert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images . Even with a JPEG-capable viewer , it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image than to view an image of a simpler format ( GIF , for instance ) . Thus , using JPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff : you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply . It 's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved , the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file . I 'll let you do the arithmetic yourself . The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet posting format is that JPEG can store full color information : 24 bits/pixel ( 16 million colors ) instead of 8 or less ( 256 or fewer colors ) . If you have only 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you . Within a couple of years , though , 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as black-and-white MacPaint format does today . Furthermore , for reasons detailed in section 7 , JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware . Hence JPEG is considerably more appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard . [ 3 ] When should I use JPEG , and when should I stick with GIF ? JPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely ; for some types of images , GIF is superior in image quality , file size , or both . One of the first things to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to . As a rule of thumb , JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or gray-scale images of `` realistic '' scenes ; that means scanned photographs and similar material . JPEG is superior even if you do n't have 24-bit display hardware , and it is a LOT superior if you do . ( See section 7 for details . ) GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors , such as cartoons and line drawings . In particular , large areas of pixels that are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by GIF . JPEG ca n't squeeze these files as much as GIF does without introducing visible defects . This sort of image is best kept in GIF form . ( In particular , single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files , but they should be avoided in JPEG files . ) JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges : a row of pure-black pixels adjacent to a row of pure-white pixels , for example . Sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting . Again , this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs , but it shows up fairly often in GIF files : borders , overlaid text , etc . The blurriness is particularly objectionable with text that 's only a few pixels high . If you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text , do n't JPEG it . Computer-drawn images ( ray-traced scenes , for instance ) usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity . The more complex and subtly rendered the image , the more likely that JPEG will do well on it . The same goes for semi-realistic artwork ( fantasy drawings and such ) . Plain black-and-white ( two level ) images should never be converted to JPEG . You need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale images . It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images of up to 256 levels , while JPEG is not . If you have an existing library of GIF images , you may wonder whether you should convert them to JPEG . You will lose a little image quality if you do . ( Section 7 , which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF , only applies if both formats start from a full-color original . If you start from a GIF , you 've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information ; JPEG can only make things worse . ) However , the disk space savings may justify converting anyway . This is a decision you 'll have to make for yourself . If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG , see section 14 for hints . Be prepared to leave some images in GIF format , since some GIFs will not convert well . [ 4 ] How well does JPEG compress images ? Pretty darn well . Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have handy , a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor . The first three files are for comparison purposes ; the rest were created with the free JPEG software described in section 6B . File Size in bytes Comments ship.ppm 1145040 Original file in PPM format ( no compression ; 24 bits or 3 bytes per pixel , plus a few bytes overhead ) ship.ppm.Z 963829 PPM file passed through Unix compress compress does n't accomplish a lot , you 'll note . Other text-oriented compressors give similar results . ship.gif 240438 Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif Most of the savings is the result of losing color info : GIF saves 8 bits/pixel , not 24 . ( See sec . 7 . ) ship.jpg95 155622 cjpeg -Q 95 ( highest useful quality setting ) This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original , at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs . ship.jpg75 58009 cjpeg -Q 75 ( default setting ) You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this from the original , even with both on-screen at once . ship.jpg50 38406 cjpeg -Q 50 This has slight defects ; if you know what to look for , you could tell it 's been JPEGed without seeing the original . Still as good image quality as many recent postings in Usenet pictures groups . ship.jpg25 25192 cjpeg -Q 25 JPEG 's characteristic `` blockiness '' becomes apparent at this setting ( djpeg -blocksmooth helps some ) . Still , I 've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were of poorer image quality than this . ship.jpg5o 6587 cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize ( -optimize cuts table overhead ) Blocky , but perfectly satisfactory for preview or indexing purposes . Note that this file is TINY : the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 ! In this case JPEG can make a file that 's a factor of four or five smaller than a GIF of comparable quality ( the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the GIF , better if you have a full-color display ) . This seems to be a typical ratio for real-world scenes . [ 5 ] What are good `` quality '' settings for JPEG ? Most JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting . There seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings . `` Quality 95 '' does NOT mean `` keep 95 % of the information '' , as some have claimed . The quality scale is purely arbitrary ; it 's not a percentage of anything . The name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting ( smallest file size ) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original . This setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another , but here are some rules of thumb . The default quality setting ( -Q 75 ) is very often the best choice . This setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image . Try -Q 75 first ; if you see defects , then go up . Except for experimental purposes , never go above -Q 95 ; saying -Q 100 will produce a file two or three times as large as -Q 95 , but of hardly any better quality . If the image was less than perfect quality to begin with , you might be able to go down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation . On the other hand , you might need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation . The second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG . The default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images , but -Q 85 to 95 is usually better for converting GIFs ( see section 14 for more info ) . If you want a very small file ( say for preview or indexing purposes ) and are prepared to tolerate large defects , a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is about right . -Q 2 or so may be amusing as `` op art '' . ( Note : the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG software described in section 6B , and to many programs based on it . Other JPEG implementations , such as Image Alchemy , may use a completely different quality scale . Some programs do n't even provide a numeric scale , just '' high '' / '' medium '' / '' low '' -style choices . ) [ 6 ] Where can I get JPEG software ? Most of the programs described in this section are available by FTP . If you do n't know how to use FTP , see the FAQ article `` How to find sources '' . ( If you do n't have direct access to FTP , read about ftpmail servers in the same article . ) That article appears regularly in news.answers , or you can get it by sending e-mail to mail-server @ rtfm.mit.edu with '' send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources '' in the body . The `` Anonymous FTP List FAQ '' may also be helpful -- - it 's usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in the news.answers archive . NOTE : this list changes constantly . If you have a copy more than a couple months old , get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive . [ 6A ] If you are looking for `` canned '' software , viewers , etc : The first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one kind of system . If you do n't see what you want for your machine , check out the portable JPEG software described at the end of the list . Note that this list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over Internet ; but some commercial programs are listed too . X Windows : John Bradley 's free XV ( version 2.00 and up ) is an excellent viewer for JPEG , GIF , and other image formats . It 's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu or ftp.cis.upenn.edu . The file is called 'xv- ? ? ? .tar.Z ' ( where ? ? ? is the version number , currently 2.21 ) ; it is located in the 'contrib ' directory on export or the 'pub/xv ' directory at upenn . XV reduces all images to 8 bits internally , which means it 's not a real good choice if you have a 24-bit display ( you 'll still get only 8-bit color ) . Also , you should n't use XV to convert full-color images to JPEG , because they 'll get color-quantized first . But XV is a fine tool for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG . CAUTION : there is a glitch in versions 2.21 and earlier : be sure to check the `` save at normal size '' checkbox when saving a JPEG file , or the file will be blurry . Another good choice for X Windows is John Cristy 's free ImageMagick package , also available from export.lcs.mit.edu , file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z . This package handles many image processing and conversion tasks . The ImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly ; for colormapped displays , it does better ( though slower ) color quantization than XV or the basic free JPEG software . Both of the above are large , complex packages . If you just want a simple image viewer , try xloadimage or xli . xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest release , 3.03. xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu , file contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z . xli is a variant version of xloadimage , said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original . ( The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage , at least with respect to JPEG files , because it has the IJG v4 decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1 . The next xloadimage release will fix this . ) xli is also free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu , file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z . Both programs are said to do the right thing with 24-bit displays . MS-DOS : This covers plain DOS ; for Windows or OS/2 programs , see the next headings . One good choice is Eric Praetzel 's free DVPEG , which views JPEG and GIF files . The current version , 2.4a , is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca ( 129.97.50.50 ) , file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg24a.zip . This is a good basic viewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines . The user interface is not flashy , but it 's functional . Another freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei 's Hiview . The current version , 1.2 , is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites ( see NOTE below ) , file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip . Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU and a VCPI-compatible memory manager ( QEMM386 and 386MAX work ; Windows and OS/2 do not ) . Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no bigger than your screen . For larger images , it scales the image down to fit on the screen ( rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do ) . You may or may not prefer this approach , but there 's no denying that it slows down loading of large images considerably . Note : installation is a bit tricky ; read the directions carefully ! A shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ( $ 30 ) . This is easier to install than either of the two freeware alternatives . Its user interface is also much spiffier-looking , although personally I find it harder to use -- - more keystrokes , inconsistent behavior . It is faster than DVPEG but a little slower than Hiview , at least on my hardware . ( For images larger than screen size , DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed , and both are faster than Hiview . ) The current version is 2.1 , available from Simtel20 and mirror sites ( see NOTE below ) , file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip . Requires a VESA graphics driver ; if you do n't have one , look in vesadrv2.zip or vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory . ( Many recent PCs have a built-in VESA driver , so do n't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains that the driver is missing . ) A second shareware alternative is Fullview , which has been kicking around the net for a while , but I do n't know any stable archive location for it . The current ( rather old ) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway . The author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly and it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time . The well-known GIF viewer CompuShow ( CSHOW ) supports JPEG in its latest revision , 8.60a . However , CSHOW 's JPEG implementation is n't very good : it 's slow ( about half the speed of the above viewers ) and image quality is poor except on hi-color displays . Too bad ... it 'd have been nice to see a good JPEG capability in CSHOW . Shareware , $ 25 . Available from Simtel20 and mirror sites ( see NOTE below ) , file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip . Due to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware , any one of these viewers might not work on your particular machine . If you ca n't get *any* of them to work , you 'll need to use one of the following conversion programs to convert JPEG to GIF , then view with your favorite GIF viewer . ( If you have hi-color hardware , do n't use GIF as the intermediate format ; try to find a TARGA-capable viewer instead . VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right thing with hi-color displays . ) The Independent JPEG Group 's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20 and mirror sites ( see NOTE below ) , file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip ( or jpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory ) . These files are DOS compilations of the free source code described in section 6B ; they will convert JPEG to and from GIF , Targa , and PPM formats . Handmade Software offers free JPEG < = > GIF conversion tools , GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF . These are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format ; in particular , you ca n't get 24-bit color output from a JPEG . The major advantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI 's proprietary JPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format . Since HSI-format files are rather widespread on BBSes , this is a useful capability . Version 2.0 of these tools is free ( prior versions were shareware ) . Get it from Simtel20 and mirror sites ( see NOTE below ) , file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip . NOTE : do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet , since it is not readable on non-PC platforms . Handmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation package , Image Alchemy . This will translate JPEG files ( both JFIF and HSI formats ) to and from many other image formats . It can also display images . A demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.1 is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites ( see NOTE below ) , file msdos/graphics/alch161.zip . NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20 : The Internet 's key archive site for PC-related programs is Simtel20 , full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil ( 192.88.110.20 ) . Simtel20 runs a non-Unix system with weird directory names ; where this document refers to directory ( eg ) `` msdos/graphics '' at Simtel20 , that really means '' pd1 : < msdos.graphics > '' . If you are not physically on MILnet , you should expect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20 . There are several Internet sites that maintain copies ( mirrors ) of the Simtel20 archives ; most FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead . A popular USA mirror site is oak.oakland.edu ( 141.210.10.117 ) , which keeps Simtel20 files in ( eg ) `` /pub/msdos/graphics '' . If you have no FTP capability , you can retrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail ; see informational postings in comp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how . If you are outside the USA , consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is . Microsoft Windows : There are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images . ( Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware , due to Windows ' system overhead . Note that you can run the DOS conversion programs described above inside a Windows DOS window . ) The newest entry is WinECJ , which is free and EXTREMELY fast . Version 1.0 is available from ftp.rahul.net , file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip . Requires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode . This is a no-frills viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it decodes ; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers . But it 's so fast you 'll use it anyway , at least for previewing ... JView is freeware , fairly fast , has good on-line help , and can write out the decompressed image in Windows BMP format ; but it ca n't create new JPEG files , and it does n't view GIFs . JView also lacks some other useful features of the shareware viewers ( such as brightness adjustment ) , but it's an excellent basic viewer . The current version , 0.9 , is available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu ( 129.79.20.84 ) , file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip . ( Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites , including wuarchive.wustl.edu . ) WinJPEG ( shareware , $ 20 ) displays JPEG , GIF , Targa , TIFF , and BMP image files ; it can write all of these formats too , so it can be used as a converter . It has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and slideshow . The current version is 2.1 , available from Simtel20 and mirror sites ( see NOTE above ) , file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip . ( This is a slow 286-compatible version ; if you register , you 'll get the 386-only version , which is roughly 25 % faster . ) ColorView is another shareware entry ( $ 30 ) . This was an early and promising contender , but it has not been updated in some time , and at this point it has no real advantages over WinJPEG . If you want to try it anyway , the current version is 0.97 , available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu , file pub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip . ( I understand that a new version will be appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS . ) DVPEG ( see DOS heading ) also works under Windows , but only in full-screen mode , not in a window . OS/2 : The following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu ( 128.123.35.151 ) . Note : check /pub/uploads for more recent versions -- - the hobbes moderator is not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories . /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip 32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs , version 4 . /pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip 16-bit version of same , for OS/2 1.x . /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc11.zip Image Archiver 1.01 : image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface . Strong on conversion functions , viewing is a bit weaker . Shareware , $ 15 . /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip PMJPEG 1.1 : OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG , a popular viewer for Windows ( see description in Windows section ) . Shareware , $ 20 . /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview84.zip PMView 0.84 : JPEG/GIF/BMP viewer . GIF viewing very fast , JPEG viewing fast if you have huge amounts of RAM , otherwise about the same speed as the above programs . Strong 24-bit display support . Shareware , $ 20 . Macintosh : Most Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple 's JPEG implementation , which is part of the QuickTime system extension ; so you need to have QuickTime installed . To use QuickTime , you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running System 6.0.7 or later . ( If you 're running System 6 , you must also install the 32-bit QuickDraw extension ; this is built-in on System 7 . ) You can get QuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com , file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx . ( As of 11/92 , this file contains QuickTime 1.5 , which is better than QT 1.0 in several ways . With respect to JPEG , it is marginally faster and considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file . However , some applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5 . ) Mac users should keep in mind that QuickTime 's JPEG format , PICT/JPEG , is not the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format . ( See section 10 for details . ) If you post images on Usenet , make sure they are in JFIF format . Most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format . The first choice is probably JPEGView , a free program for viewing images that are in JFIF format , PICT/JPEG format , or GIF format . It also can convert between the two JPEG formats . The current version , 2.0 , is a big improvement over prior versions . Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu ( 36.44.0.6 ) , file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx . Requires System 7 and QuickTime . On 8-bit displays , JPEGView usually produces the best color image quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers . JPEGView can view large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers ; in fact , it's the only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a typical 4MB Mac . Given a large image , JPEGView automatically scales it down to fit on the screen , rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers . ( You can zoom in on any desired portion , though . ) Some people like this behavior , some do n't . Overall , JPEGView 's user interface is very well thought out . GIFConverter , a shareware ( $ 40 ) image viewer/converter , supports JFIF and PICT/JPEG , as well as GIF and several other image formats . The latest version is 2.3.2 . Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu , file /info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx . Requires System 6.0.5 or later . GIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer , but it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capabilities , so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of playing around with images . Also , the newest version of GIFConverter can load and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime , so it is your best bet if your machine is too old to run QuickTime . ( But it 's faster with QuickTime . ) Note : If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG , try converting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert , then viewing the GIF version . JPEG Convert , a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities , is available from sumex-aim.stanford.edu , file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx . This will run on any Mac , but it only does file conversion , not viewing . You can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer . Previous versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6 , a JPEG < = > GIF converter based on an old version of the IJG code . If you are using this program , you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert . Apple 's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF , QuickTime JPEG , and GIF format , and can convert between these formats . You can get PictPixie from ftp.apple.com , file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx . Requires QuickTime . PictPixie was intended as a developer 's tool , and it's really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime . Some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory , it produces relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display , and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface . Worse , PictPixie is an unsupported program , meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not intend to fix . ( There is an old version of PictPixie , called PICTCompressor , floating around the net . If you have this you should trash it , as it 's even buggier . Also , the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much cleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor . Note that Picture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net . ) Storm Technology 's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter . This rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways , but it will run without System 7 or QuickTime , so you may be forced to use it on older systems . ( It does need 32-bit QuickDraw , so really old machines can't use it . ) You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu , file /info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx . You must set the file type of a downloaded image file to 'JPEG ' to allow Picture Decompress to open it . If your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw ( a Mac Plus for instance ) , GIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing . If you do n't want to pay for GIFConverter , use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer . More and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG , although not all can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format . Adobe Photoshop , version 2.0.1 or later , can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files ( use the JPEG plug-in from the Acquire menu ) . You must set the file type of a downloaded JPEG file to 'JPEG ' to allow Photoshop to recognize it . Amiga : ( Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at amiga.physik.unizh.ch ( 130.60.80.80 ) . There are many mirror sites of this archive and you should try to use the closest one . In the USA , a good choice is wuarchive.wustl.edu ; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/ ... ) HamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter , as well as being a general image manipulation tool . It 's cheap ( shareware , $ 20 ) and can read several formats besides JPEG . The current version is 2.0.8 . A demo version is available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch ( and mirror sites ) , file amiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha . The demo version will crop images larger than 512x512 , but it is otherwise fully functional . Rend24 ( shareware , $ 30 ) is an image renderer that can display JPEG , ILBM , and GIF images . The program can be used to create animations , even capturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave . The current version is 1.05 , available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch ( and mirror sites ) , file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha . ( Note : although this directory is supposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs , the program will also run under AmigaDOS 1.3 , 2.04 or 2.1 . ) Viewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer . The current version is 1.04 , available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch ( and mirror sites ) , file amiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha . If you 're willing to spend real money , there are several commercial packages that support JPEG . Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel , the author of Rend24 and Viewtek . These are CineMorph , a standalone image morphing package , and ImageFX , an impressive 24-bit image capture , conversion , editing , painting , effects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph . Both are distributed by Great Valley Products . Art Department Professional ( ADPro ) , from ASDG Inc , is the most widely used commercial image manipulation software for Amigas . ImageMaster , from Black Belt Systems , is another well-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support . The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from amiga.physik.unizh.ch ( and mirror sites ) in directory amiga/gfx/conv , file AmigaJPEGV4.lha . These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM , GIF , Targa formats . The Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs , many based on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software ( thanks to a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month , without so much as notifying the authors ) . Among these are `` AugJPEG '' , `` NewAmyJPEG '' , '' VJPEG '' , and probably others I have not even heard of . In my opinion , anything older than IJG version 3 ( March 1992 ) is not worth the disk space it 's stored on ; if you have such a program , trash it and get something newer . Atari ST : The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST , TT , etc , from atari.archive.umich.edu , file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo . These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM , GIF , Targa formats . I have not heard of any free or shareware JPEG-capable viewer for Ataris , but surely there must be one by now ? Pointers appreciated . Acorn Archimedes : ! ChangeFSI , supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10 , can convert from and view JPEG JFIF format . Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG , although this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking . Recent versions ( since 7.11 ) of the shareware program Translator can handle JPEG , along with about 30 other image formats . While older versions can be found on some Archimedes bboards , the current version is only available by registering with the author , John Kortink , Nutterbrink 31 , 7544 WJ , Enschede , The Netherlands . Price 35 Dutch guilders ( about $ 22 or 10 pounds ) . There 's also a commercial product called ! JPEG which provides JPEG read/write functionality and direct JPEG viewing , as well as a host of other image format conversion and processing options . This is more expensive but not necessarily better than the above programs . Contact : DT Software , FREEPOST , Cambridge , UK . Tel : 0223 841099 . Portable software for almost any system : If none of the above fits your situation , you can obtain and compile the free JPEG conversion software described in 6B . You 'll also need a viewer program . If your display is 8 bits or less , any GIF viewer will do fine ; if you have a display with more color capability , try to find a viewer that can read Targa or PPM 24-bit image files . There are numerous commercial JPEG offerings , with more popping up every day . I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find the available free or shareware software vastly too slow . In that case , purchase a hardware-assisted product . Ask pointed questions about whether the product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can handle the JFIF file format ; many of the earliest commercial releases are not and never will be compatible with anyone else 's files . [ 6B ] If you are looking for source code to work with : Free , portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent JPEG Group , which I lead . A package containing our source code , documentation , and some small test files is available from several places . The `` official '' archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net ( 137.39.1.9 or 192.48.96.9 ) . Look under directory /graphics/jpeg ; the current release is jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z . ( This is a compressed TAR file ; do n't forget to retrieve in binary mode . ) You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP . If you are on a PC and do n't know how to cope with .tar.Z format , you may prefer ZIP format , which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites ( see NOTE above ) , file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip . This file will also be available on CompuServe , in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum ( GO PICS ) , library 15 , as jpsrc4.zip . If you have no FTP access , you can retrieve the source from your nearest comp.sources.misc archive ; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34 . ( If you do n't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings , see the FAQ article `` How to find sources '' , referred to at the top of section 6 . ) The free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG `` JFIF '' format and image files in GIF , PBMPLUS PPM/PGM , Utah RLE , and Truevision Targa file formats . The core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other programs , such as image viewers . The package is highly portable ; we have tested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays . We have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use . Companies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products . We do not ask a royalty , although we do ask for an acknowledgement in product literature ( see the README file in the distribution for details ) . We hope to make this software industrial-quality -- - although , as with anything that 's free , we offer no warranty and accept no liability . The Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization ; if you 'd like to contribute to improving our software , you are welcome to join . [ 7 ] What 's all this hoopla about color quantization ? Most people do n't have full-color ( 24 bit per pixel ) display hardware . Typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel , so it can display 256 or fewer distinct colors at a time . To display a full-color image , the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors . This process is called `` color quantization '' . ( This is something of a misnomer , `` color selection '' would be a better term . We 're stuck with the standard usage though . ) Clearly , color quantization is a lossy process . It turns out that for most images , the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG ( except at the very lowest JPEG quality settings ) . Since JPEG is a full-color format , converting a color JPEG image for display on 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization . This is true for *all* color JPEGs : even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG , what comes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors , but thousands of colors . This happens because JPEG 's lossiness affects each pixel a little differently , so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors . Each original color gets `` smeared '' into a group of nearby colors . Therefore quantization is always required to display a color JPEG on a colormapped display , regardless of the image source . The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output . ( Incidentally , because of this effect it 's nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a JPEG image . Even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values , different JPEG decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences . I occasionally see posted images described as `` 256-color JPEG '' . This tells me that the poster ( a ) has n't read this FAQ and ( b ) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF . JPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale ( just like photographs ) , but number of colors just is n't a useful concept for JPEG . ) On the other hand , a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to 256 or fewer colors . ( A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its palette , and the format does n't allow more than 256 palette entries . ) For purposes of Usenet picture distribution , GIF has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization , so recipients do n't have to . This is also the *disadvantage* of GIF : you 're stuck with the sender's quantization . If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display , you have to re-quantize , resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image . Furthermore , if the sender did n't use a high-quality color quantization algorithm , you 're out of luck . For this reason , JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines do n't match the sender 's display hardware . JPEG 's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user 's display hardware . Furthermore , you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms ( there is a lot of active research in this area ) , or purchase better display hardware , to get a better view of JPEG images you already have . With a GIF , you 're stuck forevermore with what was sent . It 's also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines . If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA display , for example , you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to . This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations ( one to create the GIF , one to display it ) , but often it's also due to sloppiness . JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all , and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed . Thus , JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average GIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones ! Finally , an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display hardware already : 15-bit `` hi-color '' PC displays , true 24-bit displays on workstations and Macintoshes , etc . For these people , GIF is already obsolete , as it can not represent an image to the full capabilities of their display . JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively . Thus , JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images in a machine-independent fashion . [ 8 ] How does JPEG work ? The buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling , discrete cosine transforms , coefficient quantization , and Huffman or arithmetic entropy coding . This article 's long enough already , so I 'm not going to say more than that here . For technical information , see the comp.compression FAQ . This is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu , in files /pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part [ 1-3 ] . If you need help in using the news.answers archive , see the top of this article . [ 9 ] What about lossless JPEG ? There 's a great deal of confusion on this subject . The JPEG committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm , i.e. , one that guarantees the final output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input . However , this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular , lossy JPEG algorithm , and it offers much less compression . At present , very few implementations of lossless JPEG exist , and all of them are commercial . Saying `` -Q 100 '' to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image . What it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step . There is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step . ( With the V4 free JPEG code , you can also say '' -sample 1x1 '' to turn off subsampling . Keep in mind that many commercial JPEG implementations can not cope with the resulting file . ) Even with both quantization and subsampling turned off , the regular JPEG algorithm is not lossless , because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations . The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value ; it 's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye , but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image . At this minimum-loss setting , regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image . True lossless JPEG provides roughly the same amount of compression , but it guarantees bit-for-bit accuracy . If you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than 6 bits per pixel ( per color component ) , you may want to look into the JBIG bilevel image compression standard . This performs better than JPEG lossless on such images . JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with 6 or more bits per pixel ; furthermore , JPEG is public domain ( at least with a Huffman back end ) , while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents . [ 10 ] Why all the argument about file formats ? Strictly speaking , JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms ; it does *not* refer to a specific image file format . The JPEG committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations . Since we ca n't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format , this leaves us with a problem . In the absence of official standards , a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to '' do their own thing '' , and as a result their programs are n't compatible with anybody else 's . The closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work that 's been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems . They have defined two JPEG-based file formats : * JFIF ( JPEG File Interchange Format ) , a `` low-end '' format that transports pixels and not much else . * TIFF/JPEG , aka TIFF 6.0 , an extension of the Aldus TIFF format . TIFF is a `` high-end '' format that will let you record just about everything you ever wanted to know about an image , and a lot more besides : - ) . TIFF is a lot more complex than JFIF , and may well prove less transportable , because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different and incompatible subsets of TIFF . It 's not likely that adding JPEG to the mix will do anything to improve this situation . Both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of JPEG-related products ; it 's reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards . I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in picture postings . JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now ; the TIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted , and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details . Even when TIFF/JPEG is well defined , the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported `` lowest common denominator '' ; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable . A particular case that people may be interested in is Apple 's QuickTime software for the Macintosh . QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped inside the Mac-specific PICT structure . Conversion between JFIF and QuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward , and several Mac programs are available to do it ( see Mac portion of section 6A ) . If you have an editor that handles binary files , you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF by hand ; see section 11 for details . Another particular case is Handmade Software 's programs ( GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and Image Alchemy ) . These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF format . By default , though , they write a proprietary format developed by HSI . This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be used for Usenet postings . Use the -j switch to get JFIF output . ( This applies to old versions of these programs ; the current releases emit JFIF format by default . You still should be careful not to post HSI-format files , unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms . ) [ 11 ] How do I recognize which file format I have , and what do I do about it ? If you have an alleged JPEG file that your software wo n't read , it 's likely to be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format . You can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file : 1 . A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters ( hex ) FF D8 FF E0 , followed by two variable bytes ( often hex 00 10 ) , followed by 'JFIF ' . 2 . If you see FF D8 at the start , but not the rest of it , you may have a `` raw JPEG '' file . This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software -- - it 's worth a try , anyway . 3 . HSI files start with 'hsi1 ' . You 're out of luck unless you have HSI software . Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data , but they wo n't decompress properly with non-HSI programs . 4 . A Macintosh PICT file , if JPEG-compressed , will have a couple hundred bytes of header followed by a JFIF header ( scan for 'JFIF ' ) . Strip off everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it . 5 . Anything else : it 's a proprietary format , or not JPEG at all . If you are lucky , the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream . If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream ( look for FF D8 ) , try stripping off everything before that . In uuencoded Usenet postings , the characteristic JFIF pattern is '' begin '' line M_ ] C_X ... whereas uuencoded HSI files will start with '' begin '' line M : '-I ... If you learn to check for the former , you can save yourself the trouble of downloading non-JFIF files . [ 12 ] What about arithmetic coding ? The JPEG spec defines two different `` back end '' modules for the final output of compressed data : either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed . The choice has no impact on image quality , but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file . On typical images , arithmetic coding produces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding . ( All the file-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding . ) Unfortunately , the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the JPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM , AT & T , and Mitsubishi . Thus *you can not legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses from these companies . ( The `` fair use '' doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm , but actually storing any images with it is dubious at best . ) At least in the short run , I recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding ; the space savings is n't great enough to justify the potential legal hassles . In particular , arithmetic coding *should not* be used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet . There is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future . Stay tuned for further details . [ 13 ] Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression ? It would be nice if , having compressed an image with JPEG , you could decompress it , manipulate it ( crop off a border , say ) , and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially . Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE . In general , recompressing an altered image loses more information , though usually not as much as was lost the first time around . The next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it *without changing it* then there is no further loss , i.e. , you get an identical JPEG file . Even this is not true ; at least , not with the current free JPEG software . It 's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error . If you repeatedly compress and decompress , the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation output . ( It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change . ) One of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited , but I am not optimistic about it . In any case , the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg , at the original quality setting , would introduce no further loss . Even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation . ( If you 're wondering why , it 's because the pixel-block boundaries move . If you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels , you might be safe , but that 's a mighty limited capability ! ) The bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images , but you do n't want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps . Use a lossless format ( PPM , RLE , TIFF , etc ) while working on the image , then JPEG it when you are ready to file it away . Aside from avoiding degradation , you will save a lot of compression/decompression time this way : - ) . [ 14 ] What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG ? As stated earlier , you *will* lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing GIF image to JPEG . If you can obtain the original full-color data the GIF was made from , it 's far better to make a JPEG from that . But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from , here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality . The first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG , to make sure you are happy with it , before throwing away the corresponding GIF ; that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary . Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs , as explained in section 3 ; in particular , cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors do n't convert well . You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality will be *larger* than the GIF . ( So check the sizes too . ) Experience to date suggests that large , high-visual-quality GIFs are the best candidates for conversion to JPEG . They chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings , and they convert to JPEG with least degradation . Do n't waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes . Also , don't expect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created directly from full-color originals . To maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through JPEG files would be ( i.e. , shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file , not 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons ) . Many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color border around a GIF image . While useless , this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in GIF files . It is NOT free in JPEG files , and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts ( `` ghost '' edges ) . Do yourself a favor and crop off any border before JPEGing . ( If you are on an X Windows system , XV 's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this . ) cjpeg 's default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input , but for GIF inputs , Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation . ( If you apply smoothing as suggested below , the higher Q setting may not be necessary . ) Color GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually `` dithered '' to fool your eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store . If you enlarge the image , you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors ; at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value . The trouble with dithering is that , to JPEG , it looks like high-spatial-frequency color noise ; and JPEG ca n't compress noise very well . The resulting JPEG file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from JPEGing the original full color image ( if you had it ) . To get around this , you want to `` smooth '' the GIF image before compression . Smoothing averages together nearby pixels , thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway , and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give JPEG trouble . Appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high Q factor , thus further reducing the size of the compressed file , while still obtaining a better-looking output image than you 'd get without smoothing . With the V4 free JPEG software ( or products based on it ) , a simple smoothing capability is built in . Try `` -smooth 10 '' or so when converting GIFs . Values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs . Heavy-handed dithering may require larger smoothing factors . ( If you can see regular fine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement , then strong smoothing is definitely called for . ) Too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image , which you do n't want . If you are an image processing wizard , you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program , such as pnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package . However , cjpeg 's built-in smoother is a LOT faster than pnmconvol ... The upshot of all this is that `` cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10 '' is probably a good starting point for converting GIFs . But if you really care about the image , you 'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - For more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in particular , contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info @ uunet.uu.net . -- tom lane organizer , Independent JPEG Group Internet : tgl @ cs.cmu.edu BITNET : tgl % cs.cmu.edu @ carnegie

Backup lamps on current models are much brighter than they used to be on older cars . Those on my Taurus Wagon are quite bright enough to illuminate a good area behind the car , and they 're MUCH brighter than those on my earlier cars from the 60s and 70s . Insofar as Vettes having side backup lights , look at a '92 or '93 model ( or perhaps a year or two earlier too ) and you 'll see red side marker lamps and white side marker lamps both near the car 's hindquarters . Those are n't just white reflectors . Harv
