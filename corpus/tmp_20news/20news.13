You 've missed on very important passage . 2 Thess . 1:6-10 For after all it is only just for God to repay with affliction those who afflict you , and to give relief to you who are afflicted and to us as well when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with His mighty angels in flaming fire , dealing out retribution to those who do not know God and to those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus . And these will pay the penalty of eternal destruction , away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power , when He comes to be glorified in His saints on that day , and to be marveled at among all who have believed -- for our testimony to you was believed . Things to note from this passage . Unbelievers are both those who openly reject the gospel , and those who do not know God . The eternal destruction is the same as the eternal hope in 2:16 . This distructions primarily emphasize that it is separation from the presence of God . THe context is speaking of the 2nd advent while 2:1 is speaking of the rapture . Do n't confuse the two . > > In the Bible , I am not aware of any discussion about the specifics of > hell beyond the general of hot , unpleasant and torment .

If this was like earthly fire that requires a gas producing substance to ignite . However , there seems to be a different type of fire as expressed in the burning bush that was not consumed . Also , the Daniel acct . shows that the laws of nature can be interupted even with earthly fire . > It is not stated what occurs when at the judgement , > the unbelievers , ( who are already physically dead ) are cast into hell Maybe you do n't understand .

The true awlfulness of hell , is that it is eternal separation from God , after having seen the glory of His presence at the GWTJ . But whether it was open rebellion against the revealed gospel of Christ or if it is not having known GOd ( not saught Him as He is ) , then as Paul says , they are without excuss and that every mouth will be stopped . There will be no defense at the judgment seat of God .

The cesarean rate in the United States is the third highest among 21 reporting countries , exceeded only by Brazil and Puerto Rico ( 1 ) . This report presents data on cesarean deliveries from CDC 's National Hospital Discharge Survey ( NHDS ) for 1991 and compares these data with previous years . Data on discharges from short-stay , nonfederal hospitals have been collected annually since 1965 in the NHDS , conducted by CDC 's National Center for Health Statistics . For 1991 , medical and demographic information were abstracted from a sample of 274,000 inpatients discharged from 484 participating hospitals . The 1991 cesareans and vaginal births after a prior cesarean ( VBAC ) presented in this report are based on weighted national estimates from the NHDS sample of approximately 31,000 ( 11 % ) women discharged after delivery . The estimated numbers of live births by type of delivery were calculated by applying cesarean rates from the NHDS to live births from national vital registration data . Therefore , estimates of the number of cesareans in this report will not agree with previously published data based solely on the NHDS ( 2 ) . Stated differences in this analysis are significant at the 95 % confidence level , based on the two-tailed t-test with a critical value of 1.96 . In 1991 , there were 23.5 cesareans per 100 deliveries , the same rate as in 1990 and similar to rates during 1986-1989 ( Table 1 ) . The primary cesarean rate ( i.e. , number of first cesareans per 100 deliveries to women who had no previous cesareans ) for 1986-1991 also was stable , ranging from 16.8 to 17.5 . In 1991 , the cesarean rate in the South was 27.6 , significantly ( p < 0.05 ) higher than the rates for the West ( 19.8 ) , Midwest ( 21.8 ) , and Northeast ( 22.6 ) . Rates were higher for mothers aged greater than or equal to 30 years than for younger women ; in proprietary hospitals than in nonprofit or government hospitals ; in hospitals with fewer than 300 beds than in larger hospitals ; and for deliveries for which Blue Cross/Blue Shield * and other private insurance is the expected source of payment than for other sources of payment ( Table 2 ) . The same pattern characterized primary cesarean deliveries . Since the early 1970s , the number and percentage of births to older women increased ; however , if the age distribution of mothers in 1991 had remained the same as in 1986 , the overall cesarean rate in 1991 would have been 23.3 , essentially the same as the 23.5 observed . Based on the NHDS , of the approximately 4,111,000 live births in 1991 , an HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 1 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 estimated 966,000 ( 23.5 % ) were by cesarean delivery . Of these , an estimated 338,000 ( 35.0 % ) births were repeat cesareans , and 628,000 ( 65.0 % ) were primary cesareans . Since 1986 , approximately 600,000 primary cesareans have been performed annually . In 1986 , 8.5 % of women who had a previous cesarean delivered vaginally , compared with 24.2 % in 1991 . Of all cesareans in 1991 , 35.0 % were associated with a previous cesarean , 30.4 % with dystocia ( i.e. , failure of labor to progress ) , 11.7 % with breech presentation , 9.2 % with fetal distress , and 13.7 % with all other specified complications . The average hospital stay for all deliveries in 1991 was 2.8 days . In comparison , the hospital stay for a primary cesarean delivery was 4.5 days , and for a repeat cesarean , 4.2 days -- nearly twice the duration for VBAC deliveries ( 2.2 days ) or for vaginal deliveries that were not VBACs ( 2.3 days ) . In 1986 , the average hospital stay for all deliveries was 3.2 days , for primary cesareans 5.2 days , for repeat cesareans 4.7 days , and for VBAC and non-VBAC vaginal deliveries 2.7 and 2.6 days , respectively . Reported by : Office of Vital and Health Statistics Systems , National Center for Health Statistics , CDC . Editorial Note : The cesarean rate in the United States steadily increased from 1965 through 1986 ; however , the findings in this report indicate that rates have been stable since 1986 ( 3 ) . Because there is little evidence that maternal and child health status has improved during this time and because cesareans are associated with an increased risk for complications of childbirth , a national health objective for the year 2000 ( 4 ) is to reduce the overall cesarean rate to 15 or fewer per 100 deliveries and the primary cesarean rate to 12 or fewer per 100 deliveries ( objective 14.8 ) . Postpartum complications -- including urinary tract and wound infections -- may account in part for the longer hospital stays for cesarean deliveries than for vaginal births ( 5 ) . Moreover , the prolonged hospital stays for cesarean deliveries substantially increase health-care costs . For example , in 1991 , the average costs for cesarean and vaginal deliveries were $ 7826 and $ 4720 , respectively . The additional cost for each cesarean delivery includes $ 611 for physician fees and $ 2495 for hospital charges ( 6 ) . If the cesarean rate in 1991 had been 15 ( the year 2000 objective ) instead of 23.5 , the number of cesarean births would have decreased by 349,000 ( 617,000 versus 966,000 ) , resulting in a savings of more than $ 1 billion in physician fees and hospital charges . Despite the steady increase in VBAC rates since 1986 , several factors may impede progress toward the year 2000 national health objectives for cesarean delivery . For example , VBAC rates substantially reflect the number of women offered trial of labor , which has been increasingly encouraged since 1982 ( 7 ) . Of women who are offered a trial of labor , 50 % -70 % could deliver vaginally ( 7 ) -- a level already achieved by many hospitals ( 8 ) . Trial of labor was routinely offered in 46 % of hospitals surveyed in 1984 ( the most recent year for which HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 2 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 national data are available ) ( 9 ) when the VBAC rate ( according to NHDS data ) was 5.7 % . The year 2000 objective specifies a VBAC rate of 35 % , based on all women who had a prior cesarean , regardless of whether a trial of labor was attempted . To reach the overall cesarean rate goal , however , increases in the VBAC rate will need to be combined with a substantial reduction in the primary rate . One hospital succeeded in reducing the rate of cesarean delivery by applying objective criteria for the four most common indications for cesarean delivery , by requiring a second opinion , and by instituting a peer-review process ( 10 ) . Other recommendations for decreasing cesarean delivery rates include eliminating incentives for physicians and hospitals by equalizing reimbursement for vaginal and cesarean deliveries ; public dissemination of physician- and hospital-specific cesarean delivery rates to increase public awareness of differences in practices ; and addressing malpractice concerns , which may be an important factor in maintaining the high rates of cesarean delivery ( 4 ) .

HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 4 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 Malaria Among U.S. Embassy Personnel -- Kampala , Uganda , 1992 ============================================================= SOURCE : MMWR 42 ( 15 ) DATE : Apr 23 , 1993 The treatment and prevention of malaria in Africa has become a challenging and complex problem because of increasing drug resistance . Although the risk of acquiring malaria for U.S. citizens and their dependents stationed overseas generally has been low , this risk varies substantially and unpredictably . During May 1992 , the Office of Medical Services , Department of State ( OMS/DOS ) , and CDC were notified of an increased number of malaria cases among official U.S. personnel stationed in Kampala , Uganda . A review of the health records from the Embassy Health Unit ( EHU ) in Kampala indicated that 27 cases of malaria were diagnosed in official personnel from March through June 1992 compared with two cases during the same period in 1991 . EHU , OMS/DOS , and CDC conducted an investigation to confirm all reported malaria cases and identify potential risk factors for malaria among U.S. Embassy personnel . This report summarizes the results of the investigation . Malaria blood smears from 25 of the 27 reported case-patients were available for review by OMS/DOS and CDC . A case of malaria was confirmed if the slide was positive for Plasmodium sp . Of the 25 persons , 17 were slide- confirmed as having malaria . A questionnaire was distributed to all persons served by the EHU to obtain information about residence , activities , use of malaria chemoprophylaxis , and use of personal protection measures ( i.e. , using bednets and insect repellents , having window and door screens , and wearing long sleeves and pants in the evening ) . Of the 157 persons eligible for the survey , 128 ( 82 % ) responded . Risk for malaria was not associated with sex or location of residence in Kampala . Although the risk for malaria was higher among children aged less than or equal to 15 years ( 6/32 19 % ) than among persons greater than 15 years ( 11/94 12 % ) , this difference was not significant ( relative risk RR=1.6 ; 95 % confidence interval CI=0.6-4.0 ) . Eighty-two percent of the cases occurred among persons who had been living in Kampala for 1-5 years , compared with those living there less than 1 year . Travel outside of the Kampala area to more rural settings was not associated with increased risk for malaria . Four malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens were used by persons who participated in the survey : mefloquine , chloroquine and proguanil , chloroquine alone , and proguanil alone . In addition , 23 ( 18 % ) persons who responded were not using any malaria chemoprophylaxis . The risk for malaria was significantly lower among persons using either mefloquine or chloroquine and proguanil ( 8/88 9 % ) than among persons using the other regimens or no prophylaxis ( 9/37 24 % ) ( RR=0.4 ; 95 % CI=0.2-0.9 ) . Twelve persons not using prophylaxis reported side effects or fear of possible side effects as a reason . The risk for malaria was lower among persons who reported using bednets HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 5 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 all or most of the time ( 2/27 7 % ) than among persons who sometimes or rarely used bednets ( 15/99 15 % ) ( RR=0.5 ; 95 % CI=0.1-2.0 ) . The risk for malaria was also lower among persons who consistently used insect repellent in the evening ( 0/16 ) , compared with those who rarely used repellent ( 17/110 15 % ) ( RR=0 ; upper 95 % confidence limit=1.2 ) . Risk for malaria was not associated with failure to have window or door screens or wear long sleeves or pants in the evening . As a result of this investigation , EHU staff reviewed with all personnel the need to use and comply with the recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens . EHU staff also emphasized the need to use personal protection measures and made plans to obtain insecticide-impregnated bednets and to provide window and door screens for all personnel . Reported by : U.S. Embassy Health Unit , Kampala , Uganda ; Office of Medical Svcs , Dept of State , Washington , D.C. Malaria Br , Div of Parasitic Diseases , National Center for Infectious Diseases , CDC . Editorial Note : In Uganda , the increase in malaria among U.S. personnel was attributed to poor adherence to both recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens and use of personal protection measures during a period of increased malaria transmission and intensified chloroquine resistance in sub-Saharan Africa . The findings in this report underscore the need to provide initial and continued counseling regarding malaria prevention for persons living abroad in malaria-endemic areas -- preventive measures that are also important for short-term travelers to such areas . Mefloquine is an effective prophylaxis regimen in Africa and in most other areas with chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum ; however , in some areas ( e.g. , Thailand ) , resistance to mefloquine may limit its effectiveness . In Africa , the efficacy of mefloquine , compared with chloroquine alone , in preventing infection with P. falciparum is 92 % ( 1 ) . Mefloquine is safe and well tolerated when given at 250 mg per week over a 2-year period . The risk for serious adverse reactions possibly associated with mefloquine prophylaxis ( e.g. , psychosis and convulsions ) is low ( i.e. , 1.3-1.9 episodes per 100,000 users 2 ) , while the risk for less severe adverse reactions ( e.g. , dizziness , gastrointestinal complaints , and sleep disturbances ) is similar to that for other antimalarial chemoprophylactics ( 1 ) . Doxycycline has similar prophylactic efficacy to mefloquine , but the need for daily dosing may reduce compliance with and effectiveness of this regimen ( 3,4 ) . Chloroquine alone is not effective as prophylaxis in areas of intense chloroquine resistance ( e.g. , Southeast Asia and Africa ) . In Africa , for persons who can not take mefloquine or doxycycline , chloroquine and proguanil is an alternative , although less effective , regimen . Chloroquine should be used for malaria prevention in areas only where chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum has not been reported .

HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 7 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 FDA Approval of Use of a New Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine and a Combined Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis and Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine for Infants and Children ================================================================== SOURCE : MMWR 42 ( 15 ) DATE : Apr 23 , 1993 Haemophilus influenzae type b ( Hib ) conjugate vaccines have been recommended for use in infants since 1990 , and their routine use in infant vaccination has contributed to the substantial decline in the incidence of Hib disease in the United States ( 1-3 ) . Vaccines against diphtheria , tetanus , and pertussis during infancy and childhood have been administered routinely in the United States since the late 1940s and has been associated with a greater than 90 % reduction in morbidity and mortality associated with infection by these organisms . Because of the increasing number of vaccines now routinely recommended for infants , a high priority is the development of combined vaccines that allow simultaneous administration with fewer separate injections . The Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) recently licensed two new products for vaccinating children against these diseases : 1 ) the Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine ( tetanus toxoid conjugate , ActHIB Trademark ) , * for vaccination against Hib disease only and 2 ) a combined diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and whole-cell pertussis vaccine ( DTP ) and Hib conjugate vaccine ( TETRAMUNE Trademark ) , a combination of vaccines formulated for use in vaccinating children against diphtheria , tetanus , pertussis , and Hib disease . ActHIB Trademark On March 30 , 1993 , the FDA approved a new Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine , polyribosylribitol phosphate-tetanus toxoid conjugate ( PRP-T ) , manufactured by Pasteur Merieux Serum et Vaccins and distributed as ActHIB Trademark by Connaught Laboratories , Inc. ( Swiftwater , Pennsylvania ) . This vaccine has been licensed for use in infants in a three-dose primary vaccination series administered at ages 2 , 4 , and 6 months . Previously unvaccinated infants 7-11 months of age should receive two doses 2 months apart . Previously unvaccinated children 12-14 months of age should receive one dose . A booster dose administered at 15 months of age is recommended for all children . Previously unvaccinated children 15-59 months of age should receive a single dose and do not require a booster . More than 90 % of infants receiving a primary vaccination series of ActHIB Trademark ( consecutive doses at 2 , 4 , and 6 months of age ) develop a geometric mean titer of anti-Haemophilus b polysaccharide antibody greater than 1 ug/mL ( 4 ) . This response is similar to that of infants who receive recommended series of previously licensed Haemophilus b conjugate vaccines for which efficacy has been demonstrated in prospective trials . Two U.S. efficacy trials of PRP-T were terminated early because of the concomitant licensure of other Haemophilus b conjugate vaccines HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 8 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 for use in infants ( 4 ) . In these studies , no cases of invasive Hib disease were detected in approximately 6000 infants vaccinated with PRP-T . These and other studies suggest that the efficacy of PRP-T vaccine will be similar to that of the other licensed Hib vaccines . TETRAMUNE Trademark On March 30 , 1993 , the FDA approved a combined diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and whole-cell pertussis vaccine ( DTP ) and Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine . TETRAMUNE Trademark , available from Lederle-Praxis Biologicals ( Pearl River , New York ) , combines two previously licensed products , DTP ( TRIIMMUNOL Registered , manufactured by Lederle Laboratories Pearl River , New York ) and Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine ( HibTITER Registered , manufactured by Praxis Biologics , Inc. Rochester , New York ) . This vaccine has been licensed for use in children aged 2 months-5 years for protection against diphtheria , tetanus , pertussis , and Hib disease when indications for vaccination with DTP vaccine and Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine coincide . Based on demonstration of co mparable or higher antibody responses to each of the components of the two vaccines , TETRAMUNE Trademark is expected to provide protection against Hib , as well as diphtheria , tetanus , and pertussis , equivalent to that of already licensed formulations of other DTP and Haemophilus b vaccines . The Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices ( ACIP ) recommends that all infants receive a primary series of one of the licensed Haemophilus b conjugate vaccines beginning at 2 months of age and a booster dose at age 12- 15 months ( 5 ) . The ACIP also recommends that all infants receive a four-dose primary series of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis vaccine at 2 , 4 , 6 , and 15-18 months of age , and a booster dose at 4-6 years ( 6-8 ) . A complete statement regarding recommendations for use of ActHIB Trademark and TETRAMUNE Trademark is being developed .

The workshop was organized by Dr. John Greenspan and Dr. Deborah Greenspan of the Department of Stomatology , School of Dentistry , University of California , San Francisco . An international steering committee and scientific program committee provided guidance . The conference drew more than 260 scientists from 39 countries , including Asia , Africa , Europe , Central America , South America , as well as the United States and Canada . Support tor the workshop was provided by the National Institute of Dental Research , the National Cancer Institute , the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , the NIH Office of AIDS Research , and the Procter and Gamble Company . Among the topics discussed were : the epidemiology of HIV lesions ; ethics , professional responsibility , and public policy ; occupational issues ; provision of oral care to the HIV-positive population ; salivary HIV transmission and mucosal immunity ; opportunistic infections ; pediatric HIV infection ; and women 's issues . Recommendations Recommendations emerged from the workshop to define the association between the appearance of oral lesions and rate of progression of HIV , to establish a universal terminology for HIV-associated oral lesions , to look for more effective treatments for oral manifestations , to expand molecular biology studies to understand the relationship between HIV infection and common oral lesions , and to study the effects of HIV therapy on oral lesions . Epidemiology Since the First International Workshop on Oral Manifestations of HIV Infection was convened five years ago , the epidemiology of HIV infection has HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 11 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 radically changed . In 1988 , HIV infection was detected and reported largely in homosexual and bisexual males , intravenous drug users , and hemophiliacs . Today , more HIV infection is seen in heterosexual males and females and in children and adolescents . While the predominant impact of HIV infection has been felt in Africa , a major increase in infection rate is being seen in Southeast Asia as well . Five hundred thousand cases have been reported to date in this region and more are appearing all the time . Researchers are continuing to document the epidemiology of oral lesions such as hairy leukoplakia and candidiasis . They also are beginning to explore the relationships between specific oral lesions and HIV disease progression and prognosis . Social/political Issues Discussion on the social and political implications of HIV infection focused on changing the public 's attitude that AIDS is retribution for indiscriminate sexual behavior and drug use . Speakers also addressed health care delivery for HIV-infected patients , and the need to educate the public about what AIDS is , and how it is acquired . Saliva and Salivary Glands Conference speakers described transmission issues and the HIV-inhibitory activity of saliva , the strength of which varies among the different salivary secretions . Whole saliva has a greater inhibitory effect than submandibular secretions , which in turn have a greater inhibitory effect than parotid secretions . Research has shown that at least two mechanisms are responsible for salivary inhibitory activity . They attributed the HIV-inhibitory effect of saliva to the 1 ) aggregation/agglutination of HIV by saliva , which may both promote clearance of virus and prevent it reaching a target cell , and 2 ) direct effects on the virus or target cells . Other topics discussed were the manifestation of salivary gland disease in HIV-infected persons and current research on oral mucosal immunity . Pediatric Issues Pediatric AIDS recently has emerged as an area of intense interest . With early and accurate diagnosis and proper treatment , the life expectancy of HIV- infected children has tripled . The prevention of transmission of HIV from mother to child may be possible in many cases , particularly if the mother 's sero-status is known prior to giving birth . Periodontal and Gingival Tissue Disease HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 12 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 Oral health researchers continue to explore periodontal diseases and gingivitis found in individuals with HIV infection . Recommendations made at the workshop include the standardization of terminology , refinement of diagnostic markers , standardization of study design , and proper consideration of confounding variables resulting from periodontal therapy . Occupational and Treatment Issues Occupational issues surrounding the treatment of HIV-infected individuals and treatment rendered by HIV-infected health care professionals still command considerable attention . Factors under consideration include the cost/benefit of HIV testing , patient-to-health care provider transmission of HIV infection and the reverse , and the use of mainstream versus dedicated facilities for the treatment of HIV-infected patients . Conference participants anticipate that a third International Workshop on the Oral Manifestations of HIV Infection will be held in five years or less . Proceedings from the second workshop will be published by the Quintessence Company in late 1993 . -- -- -- -- - end of part 1 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Internet : david @ stat.com FAX : +1 ( 602 ) 451-1165 Bitnet : ATW1H @ ASUACAD FidoNet= > 1:114/15 Amateur Packet ax25 : wb7tpy @ wb7tpy.az.usa.na

The status lines , pins 14 , 16 , 17 , as well as the strobe , pin 1 , are bi-directional lines , and are read by base address +2 , so for 888 , to read from status , then read from 890 .

From : rodger @ zeisler.lonestar.org ( Rodger B. Zeisler ) Subject : 05/28/93 PastorTalk Organization : Rodger B. Zeisler , Plano , Tx USA Lines : 97 -= PASTORTALK =- A weekly dialogue with a local pastor on the news of the day by Carl ( Gene ) Wilkes Startext : MC344578 CompuServe : 70423,600 Internet : 70423.600 @ compuserve.com -= THIS WEEK 'S THOUGHTS =- Last week the Supreme Court refused without comment to hear an appeal by Rensselaer , IN , school officials desiring the distribution of Bibles in their public schools ( REL65 , 5/21 ) . A lower court had banned the local Gideons , an international Bible- distribution group , from passing out Bibles to fifth-graders . The ACLU 's Barry Lynn was quoted as saying that the court 's action protected the `` religious neutrality of our public schools . '' He also said that schools must serve students of `` all faiths and none . '' Schools were not to be a `` bazaar where rival religious groups compete for converts , '' according to Lynn . Several Gideons , men who are responsible for putting Bibles in hospitals and hotels , are members of our church . They tell of similar stories where they are only allowed to distribute Bibles on sidewalks around the schools , but can not go inside the schools . They tell of mild harassment by parents who do not want their children receiving a Bible from a stranger . They are willing to continue their work at a distance , but find the school 's position somewhat disheartening . I understand rationally and logically the court 's position . And , I can see the sense of fairness for all groups . But , on the other hand , when does `` neutrality '' become `` nihilism ? '' When does plurality turn into no position at all ? I see a couple of ironies here . One is that we can pass out condoms but not Bibles in our schools . Think on that one for a moment . The other is that while we are seeking `` religious neutrality '' in our schools , countries like Russia -- who , by the way , practiced '' religious neutrality '' for the past seventy years -- are making the Bible part of their public school curriculum . When I was in St. Petersburg in March , the church we worked with had trained over 100 public school teachers to teach the Bible , and the government had requested hundreds more ! I recently heard a medical doctor who is president of the Gideon chapter in Moscow tell how they are eagerly invited to the University of Moscow to distribute Bibles to the students and are given class time to explain its contents . I remember seeing a photograph of this doctor holding a Bible and speaking to the university students standing under a statue of Lenin . Now , that 's ironic ! I admit two things : 1 ) We are a pluralistic society , and all faiths have equal footing . This is what our country was founded on . 2 ) To allow every group on school grounds could create a bazaar-like atmosphere . Each city must work to be inclusive of all religions and provide a hearing for them . 3 ) -- I know I said two -- The vitality of religious faith is not dependent upon whether or not the public arena acknowledges it as valid . However -- and you knew this was coming -- I believe , disallowing the distribution of the Bible by law-abiding , caring adults in our schools only signals once again our culture 's movement away from a singular base from which we as individuals and as a nation can make moral and ethical decisions . What do you think ? -= MAIL BOX =- ( Let me know if you do not want me to print your letter or your name . ) Good column [ re : TIME coverstory about teen sexuality ] ; I agree with moral education from home , but some homes do n't have the kinds of morals I want taught .

Nntp-Posting-Host : alcor.concordia.ca Organization : Concordia University , Montreal , Canada Lines : 24 Let me remind all of those Muslim-haters out there who like to mention the Mufti 's cooperation with Germany as a reason to let Muslims be slaughtered everywhere in the world of the following facts : 1 ) Why blame the Muslims for what the Nazis did and FORGIVE ITALY , THE CROATS , AND MANY OTHER EUROPEANS FOR BEING REAL ALLIES TO HITLER ? 2 ) Why blame Muslims for supporting Germany the enemy of their enemy at the time ( Britain who colonized most of the middle east and was responsible for most atrocities against Muslims in the region ) and FORGIVE GERMANY ITSELF EVENTHOUGH IT IS THE ONE WHO CREATED NAZISM ? 3 ) As far as Muslims are concerned : THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NAZI GERMANY , AND ANTIMUSLIM COLONIALIST BRITAIN/FRANCE IN 1940 . They were all racist , anti-arab , and full of arrogance and hate . WWII and the wars in ALgeria , Sudan , and other places proved that very clearly . Even anti- semitism was not more spread in Germany than in France or Britain , it just happened to be official policy in Germany . And we will forgive you , just set our countries free . So any arguments about WWII behaviour coming from the people who killed millions in that war ( from either side ) is just plain laughable . Enough said .

I think basically the reasoning was that the > tradition in the Church held that Mary was also without sin as was Jesus . Yes . For examples of this in the writings of the early fathers , consider : You alone and your Mother are more beautiful than any others ; For there is no blemish in you , nor any stains upon your Mother . Who of my children can compare in beauty to these ? -- St. Ephrem the Syrian , Nisibene Hymns , 27:8 , around A.D. 370 Lift me up not from Sara but from Mary , a Virgin not only undefiled but a Virgin whom grace has made inviolate , free of every stain of sin . -- St. Ambrose , `` Commentary on Psalm 118 '' , 22:30 , ca . A.D. 388 There are many others . > As the tenets of faith developed , particularly with Augustine , sin was > more and more equated with sex , and thus Mary was assumed to be a virgin > for life ( since she never sinned , and since she was the spouse of God , etc . ) No . We have , for instance : Was there ever anyone of any breeding who dared to speak the name of Holy Mary , and being questioned , did not immediately add , `` the Virgin '' ? ... And to Holy Mary , Virgin is invariably added , for that Holy Woman remains undefiled . -- St. Epiphanus of Salamis , `` Panacea against all heresies '' , between A.D. 374-377 . We surely can not deny that you were right in correcting the doctrine about children of Mary ... For the Lord Jesus would not have chosen to be born of a virgin if He had judged that she would be so incontinent as to taint the birthplace of the Body of the Lord , home of the Eternal King , with the seed of human intercourse . Anyone who proposes this is merely proposing ... that Christ could not be born of a virgin . -- Pope St. Siricius , Letter to Anysius , Bishop of Thessalonica , A.D. 392 Note that St. Augustine 's conversion to Christianity was in A.D. 387 . I do n't know offhand when his election as bishop of Hippo was , but I 'm quite sure it was after 392 . The belief in Mary 's perpetual virginity originated long before Augustine 's time . We hold that it originated with the Apostles . Strictly speaking , however , Mary 's perpetual virginity is independent of her Immaculate Conception . Mary could have been Immaculately Conceived and not remained a virgin ; she could have remained a virgin and not been Immaculately Conceived . > Since we also had this notion of original sin , ie . that man is born with > a predisposition to sin , and since Mary did not have this predisposition > because she did not ever sin , she did n't have original sin . When science > discovered the process of conception , the next step was to assume that > Mary was conceived without original sin , the Immaculate Conception . No . It has been held in the Church since ancient times that original sin was transmitted at conception , when a person 's life begins . Biology had nothing to do with it . Prayerfully reflecting on the truth of Mary 's sinlessness , and the means by which God could have achieved this , the Church arrived at the truth of the Immaculate Conception . Thus , the Immaculate Conception is not a new doctrine , but the logical result of our understanding of two old ones . The celebration of the Feast of the Immaculate Conception itself was given by Pope Sixtus IV ( 1471-84 ) and the Feast was made a precept feast of the Church by Pope Clement XI ( 1700-21 ) . > Mary at that time appeared to a girl named Bernadette at Lourdes . She > refered to herself as the Immaculate Conception . Since a nine year old > would have no way of knowing about the doctrine , the apparition was deemed > to be true and it sealed the case for the doctrine . No . First of all , Lourdes is private revelation , and doctrine is not based on private revelation . The most that private revelation can do is enhance and deepen our understanding of existing public revelation , which ended with the death of St. John the Apostle . Second , the `` case for the doctrine '' was irreformably sealed in 1854 with the ex cathedra promulgation of the Bull `` Ineffabilis Deus '' by Pope Pius IX . This meant that the doctrine was formally recognized as a dogma ; a dogma , by definition , can not change and is required to be believed by the faithful . The apparition at Lourdes happened in 1858 , four years later . The most that might be claimed is that Lourdes gave the infallible proclamation of 1854 a sort of heavenly stamp of approval , but the Church has never claimed that , nor shall she . In Christ 's Peace , Brad Kaiser ( bradk @ isdgsm.eurpd.csg.mot.com ) Those who trust in Him shall understand truth , and the faithful shall abide with Him in love ; Because grace and mercy are with His holy ones , and His care is with His elect . -- Wis 3:9 [ NAB ]

Oh , and lastly , I have a very few error cards and a few cards that were originally intended to be used as card # 1 , but the company changed their mind . None of these cards are easy to get . Anyway , if you have some interest in any of these cards , please drop me a line , as I am most eager to sell a bunch off . Oh , and if you are interested , I also have 1 set of Hot Shots '92 left , and about 2 sets of California Dreaming cards as well .

From : eesnyder @ boulder.Colorado.EDU ( Eric E. Snyder ) Subject : Denver Post Classifieds : No assault weapons Nntp-Posting-Host : beagle.colorado.edu Organization : University of Colorado , Boulder Lines : 29 I came across the following notice in the Denver Post classified secction this morning ( April 26 , 1993 ) : \begin { quote } NOTICE : The Denver Post will no longer knowingly accept any advertisement to buy or sell assault weapons . The Denver Post finds that the use of assault weapons poses a threat to the health , safety , and security of its readers . \end { quote } Now I suppose the Post is within its rights to refuse such ads . However , the second sentence is so noxious , I feel compelled to bring it to the attention of the t.p.g/c.g readership . I called the Post classified number ( 825-2525 ) and expressed my displeasure . According to the supervisor I spoke to , the Post was reacting to public complaints regarding the running of assult weapon ads . However , she said the paper was keeping track of the reaction to the change in policy . I strongly encourage Denver Post readers to call and make their feelings known . Eric E.

From : loki @ acca.nmsu.edu ( Entropic Destroyer ) Subject : Letter in Colorado Daily Organization : New Mexico State University Lines : 85 NNTP-Posting-Host : kazak.nmsu.edu X-Newsreader : TIN [ version 1.1 PL9 ] The Colorado Daily recently reprinted the Wall Street Journal 's article on Paxton Quigley , including the nefarious little paragraph the Journal tacked onto the end . After recieving much assistance from various T.P.G . type folks , I wrote a letter to the editor criticizing this last paragraph , and surprise , surprise , surprise , they published it . The text follows . The Colorado Daily , btw , is the University of Colorado ( Boulder ) student ( I think ) newspaper ... not exactly a big coup , but every little bit , i guess ... ( The title was the only thing they changed/added ) '' Gun Stats '' The Daily recently reprinted an article from the Wall Street Journal , primarily concerned with Paxton Quigley , author of `` Armed and Female . '' The article , in turn , cites a misleading statistic that was originally reported in the New England Journal of Medicine . The article states , `` A study ... found that a gun in the home was 43 times more likely to be used to kill its owner , spouse , a friend , or child than to kill an intruder . '' This is an often-quoted statistic , and it is misleading for sev- eral reasons , outlined below : The study gives the impression that , if you own a gun , the likelihood that you will successfully use it to defend yourself is less than that of the gun being turned against you . The study , however , fails to take into account cases where a law-abiding citizen uses a gun to thwart a crime , without actually killing the perpe- trator . The study actually refers to 'acquaintances ' rather than 'friend ' . This would include the friendly neigh- borhood thug who shows up like clockwork , every month , the second your grandmother cashes her social security check . Possibly an acquaintance , but hardly a friend . The NEJM study is based on the immediate dis- position of cases and fails to take into account cases originally filed as homicides that were later ruled to be self-defense . Especially considering the small sample size ( 396 ) , taking these events into account has a sub- stantial effect on the 43:1 ratio quoted . Criminologist Gary Kleck gives us a slightly dif- erent statistic : a gun is 33 times more likely to be used , successfully , by a private citizen against an aggressor than it is to kill anyone at all . Further , per- sons defending themselves from aggression by using a gun fare better than those who resist vicimization by some other means , or who offer no resistance at all . Statistics available from the FBI and other agencies also show that a gun is 245 times more likely to be used by a non-criminal to defend against criminal threat than to be used to commit criminal homicide , 535 times more likely to be used to defend against a criminal threat than to accidentally kill anybody , and 50 times more likely to defend against criminal threat than to be used to commit suicide . It is well to keep in mind that nearly anything can be proved by uncritical quotation of statistics . One has to consider carefully what questions were asked by those gathering the data before one can draw an accu- rate conclusion from them . D.F .

O.K. , I 'll spell it out for you . `` Barter economy '' means that drug users will be permitted to grow or synthesize chemically anything they choose , or to buy it outside the U.S. and bring it in , if it wo n't grow here . They will also be permitted to trade with other drug users for drugs other than the ones they themselves grow or manufacture . They will not , however be able to legally sell their drugs for money . Both manufacture and importation of noncommercial drugs will be taxed , to discourage their use . `` This is your brain on drugs . Any questions ? '' > |3 .

You can not analogize the rates at which drug users would seek treatment , and the comparative ease with which it could be made available today , when these drugs are illegal to possess/use , with what it would be were they_not_illegal to possess/use . Decriminalizing possession and use makes treatment_much_easier . Drug dealers are exploiting the weaknesses of those persons who are prone to addiction , and as such , the drug users should be left alone , not thrown in prison along with their victimizers . Drug_dealers_are the criminals , and should be treated as such . Drug addiction does not absolve you of responsiblity for your criminal actions , however . > |4 .

The drug test of an arrested suspect is voluntary , not coerced , and does not therefore constitute violation of Amendment V. Those convicted who are drug users , as evidenced by the test , are in need of treatment for their problem . Institutionalization of these adddicted criminals is , I would argue , the best way to help them straighten out . If they refuse the test and are convicted , their sentence can be appropriately harsher , since they , unlike the addict , have no `` excuse '' for their crimes . > |5 .

My objective is to discourage drug use_and_criminal behavior . If fewer criminals do drugs out of fear of getting a harsher sentence if they are convicted , why is that not a good thing ? If fewer drug dealers ( who are still criminals , BTW ) can find victims , why is that not a good thing ? If fewer drug users , such as drunks , 'potheads , ' etc. , commit crimes out of fear of being cut off from their sources of supply , why is that not a good thing ?

I have heard that there were problems > with using it , or at least under older versions of DOS . Please tell ! I have been using the JOIN command for many years now , mostly with good success in duplicating unix-style file mounts . You will hear lots of people cursing JOIN because they confuse it with the dos APPEND command ( a truely gnarly hack ) , but do n't believe them . You also will hear people saying that Microsoft recommends that you not use JOIN . But , in Microsoft 's Windows 4 Workgroups Resource toolkit , the following appears : `` JOIN , an MS-DOS utility , works fine with Windows for Workgroups 3.1 if you do not change the state of the joined drives during a Windows for Workgroups 3.1 session . This includes adding or removing joined drives from within Windows for Workgroups . We recommend that you do not use JOIN when running Windows Setup or Windows for Workgroups 3.1 . '' Within this caveat , JOIN appears to be valid under windows . However , I have found a couple of applications that do n't deal well with filesystems that have been `` mounted '' using join . In particular , the worst offender is Word for Windows 2.0x . It gets very confused when you edit and then try to save a file on a joined drive . It wants to create the saved file as ~NNNNN.tmp in the current dir , then delete the old file and rename the ~NNNNN.tmp file to the *.doc file . Unfortunately , WfW usually writes the ~NNNNN.tmp file in some idiotic place other than the current directory ( often in the root dir of the joined filesystem , but not always ) . Then , after deleting the original *.doc file , it ca n't find the ~NNNNN.tmp file to rename it . Unless you search your disk systems , the document is gone . I have also found subtle problems using the MKS toolkit from a DOS box when JOINed filesystems are present . I used to join c : \temp with a 4meg ramdisk , but MKS sometimes gets confused when doing an `` ls '' on the c : \temp dir , and misses some files in the temp dir . ( This is difficult to reproduce , but it goes away totally when JOIN is not used . ) I think this is a Windows problem , rather than MKS 's , since it works OK under raw DOS . So , I would suggest that you can use JOIN , but be aware that it may not be as robust you would like . Would n't it be real great to `` mount '' network drives ( i.e . Z : ) under the main file tree , rather than having all those darned drive letters ? Unfortunately , JOIN wo n't let you do it . There was talk on the net about a simple patch to let JOIN work on network drives , but I do n't remember the source . It 's too bad the JOIN command is not better implemented , since it would avoid using all those stupid drive letters . I realize that MessDos was meant for casual , even ignorant users , so `` mounting '' all the drives in one file tree might be confusing . But , it looks like MS is going to carry this over into windows NT ( another OS meant for casual , even igorant users -- NOT ! ) . With all it 's old family system baggage , maybe MS needs a recovery group so they can get on with life : - ( . -- Jerome ( Jerry ) Schneider Domain : jls @ atg.COM Aspen Technology Group UUCP : { uunet } ! csn ! atglab ! jls PO Box 673 , Ft.

Turkish > forces which had been mobilized in anticipation begin landing on the > north shore of the island on 20th of July . This caused the welcomed > collapse of the dictatorship the 24th with Mr. Karamanlis returning from Well , I am forced to disagree with you . The Greeks started massacring the Turkish population on Cyprus in 1974 . In 1974 , Turkiye stepped into Cyprus to preserve the lives of the Turkish population there . This is nothing but a simple historical fact . Unfortunately , the intervention was too late at least for some of the victims . Mass graves containing numerous bodies of women and children already showed what fate had been planned for a peaceful minority . The people of Turkiye know quite well that Greece and the Greek Cypriots will never abandon the idea of hellenizing Cyprus and will remain eternally hopeful of uniting it with Greece , someday , whatever the cost to the parties involved . The history speaks for itself . Greece was the sole perpetrator of invasion on that island when it sent its troops on July 15 , 1974 in an attempt to topple the legitimate government of Archibishop Makarios . The release of Nikos Sampson , a member of EOKA [ National Organization of Cypriot Fighters ] and a convicted terrorist , shows that the 'enosis ' mentality continues to survive in Greece . One should not forget that Sampson dedicated his life to annihilating the Turks in Cyprus , committed murder to achieve this goal , and tried to destroy the island 's independence by annexing it to Greece . Of course , the Greek governments will have to bear the consequences for this irresponsible conduct . Turkish Cypriots are simply seeking guarantees that will preclude a repeat performance by the fanatical cadres of the Greeks ' EOKA . If such assurances are not perfectly implemented , there is every reason to expect that the local Greeks will be misguided enough to perpetrate their past mistakes . On such an occasion , the Turkish side may not find it satisfactory to act with reluctance to go any further than before , for it is unacceptable to remain always defensive against cyclical vicious attacks . Therefore it would be better to have a true federation of two separate sections living in obligatory peace , rather than another armed confrontation that would be started by the Greeks and obligatorily but decisively terminated by the Turks . The present Greek government is trying to tyrannize the Turkish population in western Thrace by forbidding it its ethnic and religious rights , which were established through international treaties . One might be better advised to remember that misadventures against Turkiye do not serve Greece well . An offer of membership in the European Common Market as bait for concessions that may doom the Turks in Cyprus to extinction is not a viable course for Greece or her friends . Neither Turkish lives nor Turkish honor has been placed on the bidding block to be sold for commercial gain .

It does a much better job than the autotracing functions which are built into illustration programs . Of course , a higher resolution bitmap will produce a more accurate trace . The problem that I 've run into though , is that when it creates a detailed trace , it produces WAY more points than are necessary . If I trace something manually , I use many less es points . The problem with this is it produces BIG files which slow everything down , especially printing . Chuck y

I have the following in my .Xdefaults : XTerm*Font : -adobe-courier-bold-r-normal -- 14-140-75-75-m-90-iso8859-1 So I believe that I have the correct font selected to use in xterm . I have NOT set my LC_CTYPE environment variable because whatever I put it , it tells me that that locale is not supported ( apparently we have no additional locales defined , or at least , /lib/locale does n't exist ) . I can get some of the characters above 127 to print out , but they are not where I 'd expect them -- for example , Alt-v does not produce a u umlaut . This leads me to believe that the fault lies with the stty settings , which are as follows : speed 9600 baud ; line = 0 ; susp < undef > ; dsusp < undef > intr = ^C ; quit = ^\ ; erase = ^H ; kill = ^K ; swtch = ^ @ eof = ^D ; eol = ^ @ ; min = 4 ; time = 0 ; stop = ^S ; start = ^Q -parenb -parodd cs8 -cstopb hupcl cread -clocal -loblk -crts -ignbrk -brkint -ignpar -parmrk -inpck -istrip -inlcr -igncr icrnl -iuclc ixon -ixany ixoff -ienqak isig icanon iexten -xcase echo echoe echok -echonl -noflsh opost -olcuc onlcr -ocrnl -onocr -onlret -ofill -ofdel -tostop Anyway , I 've struggled with this off and on for a couple of weeks , and any help anyone could offer would be greatly appreciated .

Why do n't we not talk about the `` official '' definition of foreign aid and talk about where money is really spent . More money is spent stationing troops in Germany ( ie paying the troops , maintaining bases and equip , etc ) than in Israel . Plus , Israel does not ask the US to send troops to fight her battles . If you look at the amount of money spent defending Korean shipping lanes , Norway , and other trouble spots in the world , you will see that aid to Israel - from a practical standpoint - is not that much . And so what - so what if Israel gets the most ( assuming I buy your feeble argument ) ? What is your point ? Do you not want to subsidize Israel ? Well , you have two options 1 ) Start your own campaign , get elected as president , and then force congress to cut all aid to Israel or 2 ) get the fuck out !

Even if *all* the posts in talk.politics.guns illustrated what you say they illustrate , it would still only reflect the written personas ( which is often different from face-to-face ) of a very , very small and select group .

Which is better , keeping in mind | that I 'm primarily interested in the last two tasks ? Having in mind the size of the images , my opinion is to go with VLB . It has _much_ more bandwith that EISA , which in fact can be utilized by the craphics card . ( I have not made measures , so someone else may share experience on that . ) Also , the DX2/66 is faster in the operations , that run off internal cache , slightly slower off the external and about the same off memory . So my advice is the 66/VLB . | We 're quite happy with the ATI card - very fast , ONCE the data gets to it ! ! | ~Slow~ repainting images under PhotoStyler that have moved off screen , or | been uncovered ! | There does n't seem to be enough raw cpu when running DesqView/X ! Its sluggish | running the local window manager . Also , many functions under PhotoStyler take | a long time ( even when the images fit entirely in ram ) . | There 's not enough memory in the system - DesqView/X and a 1 meg SmartDrive | do n't leave much room for other apps . Photostyler will page to disk with | medium size images . Have You tried running Photostyler without the cache ? No need to have paging and cache both . ( Well , you might argue , that the paging is cached ) . My belief ( no measurements ) is that apps left with more memory will manage it better than smartdrv.exe ( sys ) . | I have performed a number of benchmarks on the ethernet transfer rates . This | machine sustains only 120k/sec over ethernet while our Sparcs sustain 600k/sec | on the same network .

Is there such a thing as a local-bus ethernet card coming ? ? Will it | make a difference ? I 'm hoping so , and leaning towards the 486DX2-66 choice | ( above ) , for that reason . The bandwidth ( theoretical ) of ISA is over 5MB/s , which is far from 0.15MB/s . I tried my ISA IDE hard drive ( Maxtor 213MB ) and got the same results - 0.65MB/s - regardless of the ISA bus speed ( 5.5-8.25MHz ) .

The rumors are that DX3-99 ( if any ) is the most likely chip to come out .

A friend of mine worked for an electronics manufacturer on with a west-coast office . They routinely sold equipment to the Japanese . One day , the Japanese started showing up with discount demands that were amazingly close to the cost to manufacture the products . This company routinely sent most of the manufacturing data to the field offices . The Japanese had simply intercepted it . So my friend , the computer systems admin , came up with a solution . He started sending the data out double-block-encrypted with DES . Two days after this new distribution plan was implemented , the president of the company got a visit from a pair of government agents . They told him to '' knock it off '' . The president gave in , since his company did a considerable business with the federal government . Now , if the government was n't monitoring the communications , how would they even know that the encryption system was installed ? Further , since encryp- tion is n't illegal , and DES certainly is n't , what is the basis of the government 's cease-and-desist demand ? The spooks do whatever they think is necessary , with or without the blessings of the law . I 'll say `` no thanks '' to Clipper , or anything else the government produces . For the moment , double or triple DES is probably adequate . And when the line is idle , send random garbage , just to keep 'em busy . David Hayes merlin @ lerami.lerctr.org

I would , reviewing other cases I 've seen reported on in the articles I 've read etc.. , suggest the safest legal course of action is as follows . Warn your assailant loudly and in clear tones that you have a weapon ( Yes ! Even though it 's blatantly obvious now that you have it out ! ) and that you will shoot him if he advances/does not cease whatever hostile action he is currently involved in . ( ie : Drop the knife or I 'll shoot ! ) Repeat this process three times , if you can ! ( not if he 's pointing a freaking gun at you himself ! That 's kinda impractical . ) ( There are variables here and I will try to address them in turn ) After said warning ( considering it's ignored ) Aim center mass and fire until he drops ! This is not sadism , it's practicality.If he has n't gone down he 's still a threat ! ( Why I support .45 ) IF HE TURNS AND RUNS DO NOT PURSUE OR FIRE AT HIS BACK ! SHOT 'S FIRED IN ANGER WILL BURN YOU LATER ! ( Though in some cases the I can see where that might not bother me all that much ! ) If you do drop him ! REMAIN WHERE YOU ARE ! Have a Bystander or witness ( Or Create one by yelling at the top of your lungs ! ) call the police , and wait ! Reholster your weapon VISIBLY ! Or place it on the ground nearby . Do not attempt to recollect your brass.The police will use it 's location to piece together the scene along with your testimony and that of any witnesses . Mentally mark witnesses ! If the police say that none came forward let them know who you saw ! Attempt to keep your weapon loaded with the minimum required ( how the hell can I phrase this ? ) Try to avoid special purpose ammunition . Hollow points and Hydrashock rounds give the opposing lawyer the type of loaded phrasing he will need to sawy the jury that you fully intended to kill someone ! The only special purpose rounds that I can think of that would actually help your case ( as it has in several ) is the Glaser Safety Slug ( oh what a lovely name SAFETY SLUG ) The stated purpose and stated design parameters of the round are life savers in court . ( ie . Attempting to create a bullet which will not overpenetrate , not ricochette , and which is designed to STOP ( Not Kill ( Gee , to bad the two often cross , damn I 'm real sorry that rapist is dead ! NOT ! ) an assailant with one shot . This , again , can be a real life saver in a hostile court . Be as cooperative with the police as possible ! Show them where you were . Repeat your information as often as requested . They will often ask you the same questions over and over to verify facts , and , unfortunately , to see if your lying . Fill out all statements and show all required identification and weapon permits ( BOOO ! Down with registered citizens ! Register your politicians as deadly tax weapons needing to be confiscated ! ) If they are required in your state . Contact a lawyer immediately if they decide to hold you or that further questioning is needed . If you can not afford one , contact the NRA . They have a legal assistance fund . ( Or at least they used to ) I DO HOPE YOUR A MEMBER ! ( Not my business either way though.. ) If I was vague on anything , or I left some questions unanswered , you can E-MAIL me or post here .

Cheers ( ? ) , Oded -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- ( begin included text ) -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - I took a course called the MADNESS OF CROWDS , ... The course included cults and briefly mentioned/analyzed Jonestown . ( Did some external reading too ) . William Adorno ... edited a series of books on the psychology of '' evil '' mass movements ... starting with THE AUTHORITARIAN PERSONALITY , University of Chicago Press , 1948 ... an attempt to figure out what would motivate people to support fascism or be the bad guys in WWII , and by extension in other wars , in racial lynchings ... I do n't think the books are perfect , and the study of psychopathology has advanced ... , but you can elicit Koresh types from even the first volume . So I think they 're onto something . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- How cult psychology works ... [ I 'm an amateur . Hope I 'm not hopelessly naive . ] So long as Koresh could `` own '' his people , he made sure they didn't believe there was any life out there for them , away from him . Otherwise , he 'd ( Koresh ) be nothing . During the siege , ex-Davidians recounted how he convinced the people in the compound they survived only through his intercession with God to spare their worthless souls . Absolutely classic brainwashing technique . ... As long as they believed him , they 'd ignore BATF/FBI/Child Protective Services or even the Red Cross asking them to come out . After all , if they ever left him , God would catapult them straight to Hell , and the combined forces of the US gummint , with all the goodwill in the world ( doubtful ) could n't save them for a second . If I believed it , I 'd stay and die too , like the folks in Jonestown . For a prosaic analogy , replace a cult leader with an estranged wife ( or husband ) , and notice how many folks show up , kill the ex and then themselves . That 's the consequence of shattered `` cultism . '' It really does happen all the time . [ By the way , the treasured ideal in such cases , without which life is meaningless , is the relationship , no matter how abusive , rather than the individual 's partner . ] ... -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- [ Why No News , Do n't The Feds Owe The World An Explanation ? ] I agree that official explanations are in order . I can also see good ( ? ) reasons for news blackouts . > The only fact available is that had the FBI not acted > yesterday , those people would be alive today . ... that no matter what , those people would have died , because Koresh made sure they believed they had no lives outside his influence . Hence it would make little difference when or how the FBI acted . He held them hostage , as his trump against going to jail , but nothing would really stop him from offing them . Even if the FBI went away ! Look at history . Rep Leo Ryan ( and some staffers ) visited Jonestown , at the request of constituents who had relatives there . Once Jonestown was discovered , and even though they killed Ryan and his entourage ... they all killed themselves , because Jim Jones knew he'd be busted . Internal arguments asking to spare the children , brought up by some of the women in the cult , were shouted down . There are tapes ... The `` logic '' of saying that no matter how bad the gummint is , it would n't kill the kids , was shouted down as blasphemy , and the people who brought it up were threatened with ostracism by people who by THEIR OWN AVOWAL would be dead within the hour . I suspect it 's the same with the Branch Davidians . ( There 's a book on Jonestown by James Reston Jr. , titled OUR FATHER WHO ART IN HELL . I do n't know whether it 's good - never read it . ) ... The only way to prevent such a problem would be never to investigate reports of child abuse or sexual mistreatment , or organizations buying full-auto conversion kits or shipping hand grenades via UPS , on the off chance of stumbling across cults that would kill themselves . ... So , the only way the BATF/FBI could `` save '' those people , and future cults , is by ignoring such signs . I suppose there 's another way - outsmarting Koresh and tricking him into letting them go , or somehow influencing `` his '' people to abandon him while he owns most of their means of communication with the world . ... a mighty tough row to hoe . ... I suspect the FBI tried to do that with blackouts , noise and other sensory insults . However , maybe they 're not very sophisticated , or maybe the job is impossible . It's certainly possible the guy running the show was a jerk . ... -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- [ Why the FBI might want to blackout during and coverup after ] ... - if they were doing a poor job of weaning the BD 's from Koresh , they 'd want to keep it quiet so they would n't be embarrassed . ... - if they were trying to wean the BD 's from Koresh , they'd want to keep it quiet so he could n't outflank them , or well-meaning boneheads from ANY point of view would n't screw it up . ... I _hate_ playing chess when the world screams in my face , especially if at checkmate time people really die , and I could be blamed . ... I do n't think ignoring such incidents is a workable policy , unless you deny the FBI , BATF , Child Protective Services ( of whatever stripe ) and the rest of the gummint should exist at all .

MYERS : He 's going to meet there with a group of citizens , mostly people who supported us during the campaign , at around 1:30 p.m. We 're still working out the final times . Q At the airport ? MS. MYERS : No , it will be at the Boston Harbor Hotel . And then he will also meet with some -- a youth group that authored something called Project 21 . The speech to the publishers is actually at 3:15 p.m . It will be followed by Q & A . And then after the speech and Q & A , he 'll attend a reception with the publishers , and then return to Washington from Boston . And that 's it for the weekend . Q Has the President seen the report from -- or the letter , communication from the foreign service officers ; also , obviously , the communication from Madeleine Albright ? And what is his reaction to their call on him ? MS. MYERS : Well , obviously , the letter was written to Secretary Christopher . I believe Secretary Christopher received the letter on Saturday . He reviewed it and met with the authors on Monday to discuss their views . He believes it 's an important part of the policy-making process and is taking their views into account as we go forward in the development of the Bosnia policy . Q What is the President 's reaction ? MS. MYERS : The President has n't seen the letter . It was something that was directed towards Secretary Christopher . In terms of -- he has n't seen specifically the letter , but in terms of their concerns generally , what the President has said is that there are a lot of options on the table now , including ones that were n't there before . And I think he 's , as is everybody , gravely concerned about the situation in Bosnia . Q Is he influenced by that ? I mean , how does he feel about the fact that all of the specialists in that area -- those desk officers -- MS. MYERS : Many of the specialists in that area -- I think that that is clearly part of the process . It 's something -- their views will clearly be considered . I think Secretary Christopher met with the group immediately to discuss their views . I think he believes that there ought to be room for opinions and that those opinions ought to be considered , particularly from people who work closely on the issues . Q What do you mean , there are options on the table that were n't there before ? MS. MYERS : I think the President said last week that there were options , such as lifting the arms embargo to the Bosnian Muslims , that had been previously off the table that are now being considered . Q Dee Dee , in terms of those options , Madeleine Albright is saying that potentially there could be unilateral action by the U.S. if the Europeans did not go along . Is that on the table ? MS. MYERS : Well , I ca n't discuss anything that would -- any conversations that would have happened between Ambassador Albright and the President . But I think the President has said he would certainly -- is working with our European allies . He 's had a number of conversations with European leaders and is trying to build some consensus there . Q Will he reach a decision -- will he have anything specific to say today ? MS. MYERS : No . I mean , in term of there will be no new announcement of policy today . Q Does your statement mean he has ruled out unilateral action ? MS. MYERS : He 's continuing to consult with our allies at this point . He has said -- I think he 's been fairly clear about it , that the he believes that the U.S. needs to act in concert with its allies on this . Q On that point , does he believe that the U.S. , though , does have built-in authority from the United Nations already to take unilateral action ? MS. MYERS : Well , I think the U.N . Resolution 770 makes it clear that you can act unilaterally in support of any humanitarian relief effort . I think the broader point is that anything we do , any options that we decide to pursue we will make sure that it is consistent with U.N. authority , and if it 's not , we 'll work with our allies to make sure that we get it . Q Dee Dee , then how does the White House someone as distinguished as Elie Wiesel , who says that not enough is being done to stop the atrocities going on in Bosnia ? MS. MYERS : I think that that 's why we 're considering additional options . I think that Mr. Wiesel 's comments yesterday were quite compelling . The situation in Bosnia is tragic . The President is very concerned about it . He has -- I think President Clinton has worked very hard to take further actions to continue to isolate Serbia in the world community . Clearly , we 're considering other options because the President is concerned that perhaps it 's not enough . Q In terms of what you were just talking about , it sounds like Resolution 770 justifies unilateral action by the U.S. to protect humanitarian -- MS. MYERS : I do n't think it -- I would n't use the word justify . It permits unilateral action by any country in protecting the delivery of humanitarian relief . But I think that 's just an explanation of the resolution . I think any action that we take will be consistent with U.N. resolutions or we 'll work with our allies to make sure that it is permissible or we 'll get further action . Q The President and other officials have ruled out unilateral U.S. action in Bosnia in the past . You 're declining to do that this morning . MS. MYERS : No , I said the President has said repeatedly that he wants to act in concert with our allies on this . Q That does n't mean that he wo n't act alone , which has been said before explicitly . MS. MYERS : I do n't mean to imply a change in policy . The President has said all along that he wants to act in concert with our allies on this . Q One other little question . Did he know about this letter from the foreign service officers before it hit the papers ? MS. MYERS : I do n't believe so . Secretary Christopher -- they may have had a private conversation about it . The President has not seen it . Q They met on Monday , right ? Christopher met -- surely , he must have brought that up -- MS. MYERS : Again , they may have talked privately about it , but -- Q Dee Dee , what you 're saying is that the Albright recommendation has been rejected , is that correct ? MS. MYERS : No , I did n't say that at all . I said I wo n't -- I said I would n't comment on any conversations or communications . Q She 's advocating unilateral action and you 're saying , in effect , that we will not take unilateral action . MS. MYERS : I am not confirming anything that Madeleine Albright may or may not have recommended . Q Given the sometimes delicate , complicated and frustrating nature of negotiations with the allies on this issue , does the President find this kind of letter from 12 foreign service officers of the State Department helpful to that process , hurtful to that ? MS. MYERS : I think that their views are obviously being considered . The Secretary received that memo on Saturday and two days later he met with them in order to have a more thorough airing of their views , of the basis for their views , to discuss in greater detail the options that they had presented in the letter . Q Does n't it put some kind of pressure on -- additional pressure on him now from within his own administration to act regardless of what the allies may or may not do ? MS. MYERS : I think clearly there 's a broad policy review underway now . And the President and his advisors are considering a number of options , including some of those outlined in the letter from the folks over at the State Department . Now , no decisions have been made on that yet , but I think that there is a through review underway , and that their opinions are being very seriously considered . Q If I can just follow up , I guess what I 'm looking for is what was his reaction to this letter ? Did he say , good , this bolsters my position ? Or did he say , damn , this is just what I do n't need right now ? MS. MYERS : I think he said this helps contribute substantively to the debate . It 's important that all views be considered and aired thoroughly , that before he makes a decision he wants to have the best possible advice and information possible , and this , I think in many ways , furthers that goal . Q So internal advice to a Cabinet official or the President -- it 's all open now , and you would n't take any umbrage or say that they were out of line ? MS. MYERS : I think that the fact that Secretary Christopher met with them to discuss their views and make sure they had an opportunity to have a more complete conversation about it is conclusive evidence that their views are welcome . Q Does the policy review include what Madeleine Albright has suggested , and what Joe Biden and others have suggested , which is that the previous U.N. resolutions authorize unilateral action -- military action -- for the delivery of humanitarian -- MS. MYERS : I think all options are on the table . Q The unilateral option is on the table ? MS. MYERS : I think all options are on the table . Q We 've had two different -- Q Is n't that a change , Dee Dee ? Q That would be a change of policy . Q Particularly if it includes ground troops , which has been specifically ruled out . MS. MYERS : I think the President has been -- well , no . I do n't -- that is not -- Q Are you talking about all options ? MS. MYERS : All options -- I think the President has been fairly clear about that . So let me just review again what he has said . He has said that -- the President has said all options are on the table , with the exception of the introduction of ground troops , which he has never suggested . He has ruled that out from the beginning . Q Has n't he ruled out unilateral action of any sort ? MS. MYERS : He has said that he does n't believe the U.S. can solve the problems in the former Yugoslavia by itself . I think that there are a number of very complicated options on the table right now . I do n't think that -- again , I do n't want to comment on specific options that are being considered other than in the broad categories that we 've already said -- things like lifting the arms embargo against the Bosnian Muslims , things that I think we 've talked about in broad terms . This is a very complicated situation . The options being presented and considered are very complicated . Q Air strikes on the table ? MS. MYERS : Again , I think that 's been fairly clearly pointed out that that 's something that 's being discussed . Q Dee Dee , are ground troops on the -- MS. MYERS : No , ground troops are not being considered . Q You said there was not going to be -- you said you were not announcing a change of policy . Then you said everything is on the table . We 're confused . Are unilateral actions on the table ? MS. MYERS : All I can tell you is what the President has said -- that he does n't believe -- that he wants to act in concert with the allies on this . Q Wants to , but he 's willing to -- I mean , if they do n't go along -- MS. MYERS : He 's continuing to consult with our allies on this . He 's continuing to have discussions . He 's continuing to press them for further action . And I think that 's clear . The conversation is ongoing . We 're going to continue to work with them to find the best possible solution and next step on this . Q Dee Dee , the allies have taken the position that to conduct any kind of air strikes in Bosnia would have the opposite effect of ensuring the delivery of humanitarian aid ; that they feel that their troops on the ground monitoring the delivery of that aid would become vulnerable and the Bosnians -- MS. MYERS : I 'm not sure that 's the consistent -- I mean , I 'm not sure who you 're referring to . Q The British and the French . Q Yes , the British and French . They 've taken the position that the delivery of humanitarian aid would be jeopardized by any kind of air strikes against the Bosnian military . Does the U.S. believe differently from that ? MS. MYERS : The President has had conversations with both Mitterrand and Major , as you know . I think that there is a thorough review of policy going on in those countries as well . And I do n't want to comment on the nature of the President 's discussions other than to say that he 's continuing to consult with our allies as we move forward and he 's continuing to press them for further action . And I think that process is ongoing . Q the other day voted against any military intervention yesterday . Does the President regard that as the end of the line or does he does still hold out some possibility of unilateral action ? The allies have been very , very plain that they do not want to do anything . MS. MYERS : The consultations are ongoing . That 's all I can tell you at this point . Q Are you saying that there wo n't be any announcement on Bosnia today in the press conference ? MS. MYERS : No , that is not the intention of the press conference . Q What is the intention ? MS. MYERS : It 's an opportunity to take questions . He may have a brief -- I 'm sure he 'll have a brief opening statement , but it is not an opportunity to outline a new policy on Bosnia . That will not happen . Q Can you tell us what the subject of the opening statement is ? MS. MYERS : It 's sort of a general statement of where we are . Q After the first hundred days , you mean ? MS. MYERS : It 's not a long statement . I mean , this is just generally . Do n't look for any major policy pronouncements . Q Do you know what the opening statement is ? MS. MYERS : But it 's -- perhaps later today I 'll be able to tell you with more certainty -- I think that 's still under review . But the overriding purpose of this -- it 's not a mystery ; it 's not meant to be . It 's just to take questions . Q It would be helpful to know whether -- what the opening statement is on . MS. MYERS : Since the major purpose here is just to take questions , it 's not completely resolved yet . Q Dee Dee , one policy that was expected last week and that the White House , you and George seemed to indicate we might get , would be an AIDS czar . Will he announce that today ? And what 's the delay on that ? MS. MYERS : I do n't think we meant to imply -- I think we said it would happen soon . I do n't think we meant to imply with any certainty that it would be this week . It is coming soon . I do n't anticipate that happening today . Q What 's the delay ? Is n't this the perfect time to announce an AIDS czar ? MS. MYERS : I do n't know that it 's a delay . I think the process is ongoing to find the best possible person and to go through the necessary background checks , and to make sure that we 've crossed the t 's and dotted the i 's before we make an announcement . Q Dee Dee , what are Zoe Baird 's qualifications for the Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board ? And why was n't her appointment announced here ? MS. MYERS : The qualifications -- I do n't know if there 's a specific list ; I 'll have to check and see . I think there are a number of people there on the board with different backgrounds . Many of them have long histories in intelligence or other government service . I think there 's a broad variety of views across political spectrum and across backgrounds that are represented there . We never made a formal announcement other than the Chairman of the Board , which is Admiral William Crowe . Q Why would he appoint her , though , if the American people and many in the Senate rejected her for another government job ? MS. MYERS : I do n't believe that the American people ever had -- voted on her . And I certainly -- she was never rejected in the Senate . She never went up there for a hearing . But the President believes she 's a very competent person . He 's said that -- Zoe Baird -- do you understand what the question is ? Zoe Baird is on the President 's Foreign Intelligence -- Q You said she never went up there for a hearing ? Q Her nomination was withdrawn after public outrage over violating federal laws ? MS. MYERS : Right , she never -- she was never -- but you said she was rejected by the Senate . I was just simply trying to point out that she was never voted on by the Senate . Q So you do n't think that is any problem ? MS. MYERS : I do n't think there 's any problem . Q She has been appointed to this board , is that a fact ? MS. MYERS : Yes . Q Does she need confirmation for this ? Does she need confirmation to be a member of the -- MS. MYERS : No . It 's a presidential appointment . Q Usually , announcements are made here at the White House . Was there a decision not to announce her publicly ? MS. MYERS : We did n't make an announcement . People who asked were told who the members of the board were . We did n't make an official announcement . If anybody 's interested in that we can certainly put out the list of names . Q I 'd like to know . Q Do n't such board members -- do n't you normally as a matter of -- routinely put out releases on all these boards and presidential appointment regardless of their dimension ? MS. MYERS : Not always . But , again , I 'm happy to put this out . Q Is n't that the standard practice ? Q That was past practice . MS. MYERS : Again , I 'm happy to put it out . We 'll put out a list of the members of the board today . Q Dee Dee , I do n't want to try to fail to let you get out of this swamp but -- ( laughter ) -- all I really want to know is has n't it been the practice in this administration for such announcements to be made routinely ? MS. MYERS : I think generally but not always . And we 're happy to put that out today . Q What is the board , what is her title , what is the size of the board ? MS. MYERS : There is roughly a dozen members on the board . It is a civilian board , although their are some , obviously , retired military personnel on the board that provide input into intelligence policy for the President . Again , the chairman of that board is Admiral William Crowe . Q And did he recommend Baird ? Q What 's the name of the board ? MS. MYERS : It 's the President 's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board , PFIAB . Q What 's her qualification -- that she had employed an illegal alien ? Is that -- ( laughter ) -- MS. MYERS : Do you want an answer to the question or you just want to make a joke ? Q Let me phrase it another way . Why should n't this appointment be viewed as a pay-back for the difficulty she had a couple of months ago ? MS. MYERS : Because it 's not . Q What 's her experience in foreign intelligence ? MS. MYERS : She 's an experienced attorney , someone who the President believes is very competent and qualified . And I think part of the mission of this board is to provide civilian input . Not everybody on the board is supposed to be an intelligence expert ; that is not the board 's mission . It is to provide civilian input for the President as he makes decisions regarding intelligence matters . He believes she 's very qualified , very competent person , enormously talented and has said that throughout . Q Is this just a figment of my overactive imagination , or was there discussion early on about abolishing the President 's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board ? MS. MYERS : I do n't think so . On December 24th , when he announced all of his foreign policy advisors he announced that he would -- had appointed Admiral Crowe as the head of the board . So I do n't believe there 's ever been any -- Q Earlier than that , during the transition . MS. MYERS : No , I do n't believe so . It was announced , again , on December 24th . Admiral Crowe could n't be there , but it was announced . Q Are members paid ? MS. MYERS : I do n't believe so , but I 'll double-check . Q On another subject , on Waco , how do you explain the discrepancy between the federal reports of the autopsies of the bodies that are coming out of Waco and the state ? I guess it 's the Texas Ranger reports . MS. MYERS : Most of the information is coming -- the federal information is coming from the site . Clearly , there 's been some discrepancies and the Justice Department is looking into it . Officials in the Justice Department were told , I believe the day before yesterday , that there were several bodies found with bullet holes . I think there 's some discrepancy about that , and the Justice Department is looking into it . Q Is the President going to get involved in trying to sort out what seems to be becoming a jurisdictional morass down there , with some people withdrawing , others saying they 're in charge , but others -- Justice , FBI , Texas Rangers -- all grabbing a piece of this ? MS. MYERS : I do n't know that he 's going to try to mediate the dispute . I mean , I 'll let you know if there 's anything he intends to do about it . But as you know , there are several levels of investigation ongoing , and we 're hopeful that they can work together . Q Is there any one agency or official down there in charge of everything ? MS. MYERS : I do n't know . I 'll have to get back to you on that . Q What is the subject matter of Sunday 's speech ? MS. MYERS : It 's going to be fairly general . I do n't think it 's going to be any specific announcements . I think it 's going to be sort of a -- Q Does he have a topic that he 's going to talk about ? MS. MYERS : We 're still working on it . But I would n't look for any announcements of , like , the drug czar or something like that . Q Is it sort of a 100 days speech , sort of `` my excellent adventure for 100 days '' ? ( Laughter . ) MS. MYERS : Not exactly , but I think he 'll take a little bit broader look about what 's happened in the last -- Q Foreign , domestic ? MS. MYERS : A little bit of both , but I think a lot of domestic . Q And overview . MS. MYERS : Yes , more of an overview than a specific policy announcement . Q Has there been an agreement yet on a forum by which the President will address the gay rights march on Sunday ? MS. MYERS : It will be a letter read to the crowd by Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi . Q Is that available ? MS. MYERS : Not yet , but it will be . Sure . Q Are you going to put it out here or -- MS. MYERS : We 'll probably put it out here on Sunday . Q Travel next week ? MS. MYERS : Unclear . Q What was the question ? Q Likely ? MS. MYERS : I do n't -- Q Likely ? Possible ? MS. MYERS : Possible . Q What 's possible ? MS. MYERS : Travel . Q George mentioned yesterday campaign finance reform and national service legislative proposals next week . Do you have days yet for them ? MS. MYERS : Not yet . Q Can you tell us which order ? MS. MYERS : Campaign finance reform first ; national service later in the week . Q Is there any coverage tomorrow in Williamsburg ? MS. MYERS : No . Q And any report in the aftermath of the day ? MS. MYERS : Any readout from the day ? Q Readout . MS. MYERS : It 's possible . Jeff Eller will be down there . I think he can go through what the President did during the day . We do n't expect any photo op or anything , other than departure here in the morning . Q Dee Dee , the President has not made a regular practice , as some of his predecessors have , of going to Camp David . In fact , he 's been there -- what -- once or twice ? MS. MYERS : Twice . Q Why this weekend ? MS. MYERS : He went two weekends ago , as you know , on the way home from his father-in-law 's funeral . I think that they found it to be a good experience and a nice way for them to spend some time together as a family . And this is just an opportunity to do the same . Q There 's no march there . Q It has nothing to do with the march here ? MS. MYERS : No . Q Since he 's going to be in town Sunday morning now instead of in Jamestown , have you thought about him making a quick pass-by , fly-over -- ( laughter ) -- MS. MYERS : He 'll fly straight to Boston . Q Flying straight did you say ? ( Laughter . ) Q George took a question yesterday on Waco . The President had said on Tuesday in the Rose Garden that there was a minor disagreement on tactics between the military advisors and the FBI . And the question was whether you knew exactly what that was and whether it related to the use of the particular kind of tear gas . Do you have an answer on that ? MS. MYERS : I do n't . I 'll check . THE PRESS : Thank you . END10:59 A.M. EDT

How can you have the gall to even open your mouths about > Karabakh , until Turkish troops are completely out of the independent > island of Cyprus . No wonder you 'wieneramus ' are in such a mess . Following the Greek Cypriot attempt to annex the island to Greece with the aid of the Greek army , Turkiye intervened by using her legal right given by two international agreements . Turkiye did it for the frequently and conveniently forgotten people of the island , Turkish Cypriots . For those Turkish Cypriots whose grandparents have been living on the island since 1571 . And the next is 'Karabag ' . The people of Turkiye know quite well that Greece and the Greek Cypriots will never abandon the idea of hellenizing Cyprus and will remain eternally hopeful of uniting it with Greece , someday , whatever the cost to the parties involved . The history speaks for itself . Greece was the sole perpetrator of invasion on that island when it sent its troops on July 15 , 1974 in an attempt to topple the legitimate government of Archibishop Makarios . The release of Nikos Sampson , a member of EOKA [ National Organization of Cypriot Fighters ] and a convicted terrorist , shows that the 'enosis ' mentality continues to survive in Greece . One should not forget that Sampson dedicated his life to annihilating the Turks in Cyprus , committed murder to achieve this goal , and tried to destroy the island 's independence by annexing it to Greece . Of course , the Greek governments will have to bear the consequences for this irresponsible conduct . THE MUSEUM OF BARBARISM 2 Irfan Bey Street , Kumsal Area , Nicosia , Cyprus It is the house of Dr. Nihat Ilhan , a major who was serving at the Cyprus Turkish Army Contingent . During the attacks launched against the Turks by the Greeks , on 20th December 1963 , Dr. Nihat Ilhan 's wife and three children were ruthlessly and brutally killed in the bathroom , where they had tried to hide , by savage Greeks . Dr. Nihat Ilhan happened to be on duty that night , the 24th December 1963 . Pictures reflecting Greek atrocities committed during and after 1963 are exhibited in this house which has been converted into a museum . AN EYE-WITNESS ACCOUNT OF HOW A TURKISH FAMILY WAS BUTCHERED BY GREEK TERRORISTS The date is the 24th of December , 1963 ... The onslaught of the Greeks against the Turks , which started three days ago , has been going on with all its ferocity ; and defenseless women , old men and children are being brutally killed by Greeks . And now Kumsal Area of Nicosia witnesses the worst example of the Greeks savage bloodshed ... The wife and the three infant children of Dr. Nihat Ilhan , a major on duty at the camp of the Cyprus Turkish Army Contingent , are mercilessly and dastardly shot dead while hiding in the bathroom of their house , by maddened Greeks who broke into their home . A glaring example of Greek barbarism . Let us now listen to the relating of the said incident told by Mr. Hasan Yusuf Gudum , an eye witness , who himself was wounded during the same terrible event . `` On the night of the 24th of December , 1963 my wife Feride Hasan and I were paying a visit to the family of Major Dr. Nihat Ilhan . Our neighbours Mrs. Ayshe of Mora , her daughter Ishin and Mrs. Ayshe 's sister Novber were also with us . We were all sitting having supper . All of a sudden bullets from the Pedieos River direction started to riddle the house , sounding like heavy rain . Thinking that the dining-room where we were sitting was dangerous , we ran to the bathroom and toilet which we thought would be safer . Altogether we were nine persons . We all hid in the bathroom except my wife who took refuge in the toilet . We waited in fear . Mrs. Ilhan the wife of Major Doctor , was standing in the bath with her three children Murat , Kutsi and Hakan in her arms . Suddenly with a great noise we heard the front door open . Greeks had come in and were combing , every corner of the house with their machine gun bullets . During these moments I heard voices saying , in Greek , `` You want Taksim eh ! '' and then bullets started flying in the bathroom . Mrs. Ilhan and her three children fell into the bath . They were shot . At this moment the Greeks , who broke into the bathroom , emptied their guns on us again . I heard one of the Major 's children moan , then I fainted . When I came to myself 2 or 3 hours later , I saw Mrs. Ilhan and her three children lying dead in the bath . I and the rest of the neighbours in the bathroom were all seriously wounded . But what had happened to my wife ? Then I remembered and immediately ran to the toilet , where , in the doorway , I saw her body . She was brutally murdered . In the street admist the sound of shots I heard voices crying '' Help , help . Is there no one to save us ? '' I became terrified . I thought that if the Greeks came again and found that I was not dead they would kill me . So I ran to the bedroom and hid myself under the double-bed . An our passed by . In the distance I could still hear shots . My mouth was dry , so I came out from under the bed and drank some water . Then I put some sweets in my pocket and went back to the bathroom , which was exactly as I had left in an hour ago . There I offered sweets to Mrs. Ayshe , her daughter and Mrs. Novber who were all wounded . We waited in the bathroom until 5 o'clock in the morning . I thought morning would never come . We were all wounded and needed to be taken to hospital . Finally , as we could walk , Mrs. Novber and I , went out into the street hoping to find help , and walked as far as Koshklu Chiftlik . There , we met some people who took us to hospital where we were operated on . When I regained my consciousness I said that there were more wounded in the house and they went and brought Mrs. Ayshe and her daughter . After staying three days in the hospital I was sent by plane to Ankara for further treatment . There I have had four months treatment but still I can not use my arm . On my return to Cyprus , Greeks arrested me at the Airport . All I have related to you above I told the Greeks during my detention . They then released me . '' ON FOOT INTO CYPRUS 'S DEVASTATED TURKISH QUARTER We went tonight into the sealed-off Turkish quarter of Nicosia in which 200 to 300 people have been slaughtered in the last five days . We were the first Western reporters there , and we saw some terrible sights . In the Kumsal quarter at No . 2 , Irfan Bey Sokagi , we made our way into a house whose floors were covered with broken glass . A child 's bicycle lay in a corner . In the bathroom , looking like a group of waxworks , were three children piled on top of their murdered mother . In a room next to it we glimpsed the body of a woman shot in the head . This , we were told , was the home of a Turkish Army major whose family had been killed by the mob in the first violence . Today was five days later , and still they lay there .

From : kimgh @ mentor.cc.purdue.edu ( Gene Kim ) Subject : REVIEW : 1989 Ford Taurus SHO Organization : Purdue University Lines : 330 Review of 1989 Ford Taurus SHO -- By Gene Kim ============================================= Background : Last week , I bought a 1989 Ford Taurus SHO , moving up from driving a 1987 Toyota Celica ST and a 1975 Oldsmobile Cutlass . I have been interested in buying a SHO for about five months and have been combing the classifieds in Denver and Chicago every week . I bought a remarkably clean maroon/red SHO with 92K miles on it for $ 6800 . As far as I can tell , this is about $ 2000 under Blue Book and I still have another 8000 miles before the Extended Service Plan runs out . As one should with any pre-1991 SHOs , I made sure that the car was already refit with the upgraded clutch and pressure plate , as well as having been recalled for upgraded rotors and seatbelt attachments . However , my SHO does not have the newer rod shifter -- I understand I can get this for $ 230 from any Ford service center . In addition , the car received the full tune-up at 60K miles , receiving new platinum plugs and valve adjustment . For a car with 92K miles on it , the car was virtually immaculate . The clearcoat paint job was devoid of any large chips or dents , although the front air-dam/molding was covered with lots of small scratches -- not surprising since most of the miles were spent on the highway . Having driven a smaller two-door coupe for so long , I was a bit concerned about whether I could get used to driving a larger car . To my surprise , the size of the car does n't bother me at all -- it seems just as nimble as my Celica ! ( No comparisons with my Oldsmobile . : - ) Visibility from the driver 's seat is excellent , helped mostly by of the small the quarter-windows , aft of the back-seat door windows and in front of the C-pillar and rear window . Parallel parking is a bit more difficult , but other than that , I love the size . In fact , I 'm starting to appreciate the large trunk as I pack up for a 14-hour drive to Washington , DC for the summer . More on the ride later in this review . Engine : As with anyone even slightly interested in SHOs , I was very interested in the 24-valve 3.0L Yamaha `` Shogun '' engine . I was not disappointed . Base performance of the engine under 4000 rpms is good . You can even do reasonable launches from second gear , although I do n't make a practice of this . The engine revs smoothly and eagerly -- tooling around town does not require many shifts . This is good since the shifter is definitely one of the weakest points of the car . ( More on this later . ) While the performance of the engine under 4000 rpms may be unremarkable , it undergoes a Jekyll/Hyde transformation once you hit higher revs . At 4500 rpms , a butterfly valve opens and you can literally hear and feel the geometry of the engine changing as twelve more valves open up . The engine soars to its 7000 rpm redline , and you are treated to , in my opinion , the sweetest sounding V6 around . The engine inexplicably sounds OVERJOYED to be at 6500 rpm ! I 've noticed that when I drive around town , I constantly watch the tach to see how far below 4000 rpm I am . To go from 2000 rpm to 4000 , you may have to punch the accelerator -- while torque is more than adequate , it does n't come fully online until those other 12 valves are used . Transmission : When _Car and Driver_ first reviewed the car in 1988 , they marvelled at how Ford had put such a wimpy clutch and balky shifter into the car . I remember driving a friend 's parent 's SHO in 1990 , and remember thinking about whether I had the leg strength to drive the car in traffic -- the clutch was that stiff . That was back then . The entire clutch assembly on my SHO has been replaced under a Ford recall in 1991 . The clutch on the SHO feels no stiffer than the one on my Toyota Celica . In fact , the friction point seems a bit larger and more forgiving . When playing with the shifter with the car parked , the shifter felt very reasonable . The 1-2 and 3-4 gates were where you 'd expect it to be , and the shifting action was smooth . On the road , it's much the same -- but you have to shift SLOWLY ! Make no mistake , it's a clumsy shifter . When hurrying shifts , like when I was initially trying to impress friends , I consistently miss the 1-2 shift , often grope clumsily for the 2-3 shift , and sometimes even muff the 3-4 shift . I find this pretty amazing in a car like this . It also took me several days to realize that you get the smoothest shifts when you take your time . Seems obvious , but compared to my Toyota and my friend 's Honda , this seems atrocious and clumsy . Someone on rec.autos noted that CRXs should blow SHOs off-the-line because of the incredibly clumsy shifter . I now shift much more sedately , and the shifter seems more reasonable . When you play within these bounds , the shifter works smoothly with no surprises . I do n't know whether the rod shifter upgrade would help at all . Along these same lines , I initially had trouble shifting gears smoothly . Again , slowing down the shifts and taking more care to match revs when letting out the clutch helped immensely . This took several days for me to get the hang of . ( I think some of my problems were because I 've never had a car with enough power to balk at bad shifts in higher gears . ) Occasionally , I have trouble shifting into reverse . The shifter refuses to enter the gate , and I often grind the synchros trying to get it into gear . I 'll be watching this carefully in the next couple of months . A quirk : When I upshift and the engine drops back to 1000-2500 rpm , I hear a whirring and then a grinding noise coming from the the engine compartment . Not terribly loud , but the passenger can definitely hear it . I asked about it when I was looking at the car , as do all my passengers . Apparently , this is a definitely a `` SHO sound '' and is the gearbox -- apparently called `` gear rollover '' . Replies to my queries on rec.autos are at the end of this review . Exterior : As I mentioned before , I am astounded by how well the body of this SHO has stood up . Paint chipping on the front bumper and grille are virtually non-existent . Looking at how older Tauri sometimes do n't age so gracefully , I wonder what the guys at Ford did differently to the SHO bodies . The body , in my opinion , is extremely attractive with matching color body moldings than the stock Tauri . For some odd reason , the SHO seems different enough from vanilla Tauri to get stares at stoplights -- of course , this could be my overactive imagination . : - ) SHOs get fog lights , a more open grille , a completely monochromatic exterior , and a deeper ground skirt in the back with '' SHO '' stenciled in relief . I 've seen a couple SHOs whose owners have colored these in with florescent colors or in black . Yuck . I do n't think the car is flashy . I like it that way . I feel almost anonymous with all those Tauri out there , but different and distinctive enough to those of us who care . : - ) Interior : The interior is what really makes me feel like I do n't deserve the car . The seats are grey leather , the steering wheel and shifter are covered with black leather , and the entire instrument panel is done in a black/grey/metallic scheme . The instrumentation is stock Taurus , except for the 140 mph speedo and 8000 rpm tach . You get a center console with two cupholders , a large compartment under the radio ( great for a CD player ) , an armrest that contains yet another compartment , three appropriately sized coin holders for tollways ( I think ) , and a compartment for holding cassette tapes . There 's map-holders in the doors , and an oddly small glove compartment . I spilled a whole can of Coke in the cupholder and was delighted to find that the entire rubber holder can be removed and washed in a sink . Hey , I 'm really impressed with the ergonomics and thoughtfulness that went into its design . And it 's a 1989 , before the interior was upgraded ! The backseat is bigger than any car I 've had . Why do they need so much space ? : - ) ( No smart-ass comments , please . : - ) The driver and passenger seat have lumbar and side bolsters . From what I hear , it 's not uncommon for the side bolsters to show wear . Mine is no exception . The left side bolster on the driver 's has cracked and I 'm not convinced the right bolster is inflating all the way . A big surprise for me : I forgot that SHOs do n't have a normal hand parking brake . Instead , they have the regular parking brake that you press with your left foot . Too bad . Again , I 'm getting used to it , but it seems a bit anachronistic to me . Ride : The suspension is nice and stiff . Too stiff ? It 's stiffer than any car I 've had . A friend 's new 1993 Toyota Celica ST seems tauter and is still able to soak up bumps better . The SHO seems stiffer with less ability to soak up bumps . Driving over railroad tracks is a noisy and jarring affair . On the other hand , taking turns feels wonderful because the body is so rigid and does n't flex at all -- I listened for that before I bought the car . On the highway , the ride is great . When I drove the car from Chicago back to Purdue , I had trouble keeping under 85 mph , let alone from trying to see what 100 mph really feels like . It 's a relatively quiet ride , but the sunroof rattles . I 've tried to find out what exactly makes all the noise up there , but it seems to be the window that rests on the rails . No easy way to get rid of it , I think . Over the past three days , I 've oscillated between thinking the suspension is wonderful and perfect and thinking that the ride is way too rough . ( Not for me , mind you . But I wonder whether I would advise my dad to buy one for himself . ) But , I 've discovered , as with the shifter , if you take your time with shifts , you 'll have no reason to complain . Let me explain ... The ride is worst when turning and applying lots of power to the wheels . I feel the wheels scrabbling for traction and torque steer making the car skitter left and right . After I understood this , I avoid the limits of traction -- and I 'm a happy camper again . It 's not body rigidity , but the composure of the car . As if matching the suspension , the steering feel is quite heavy . My first impression of driving my SHO was how hard you had to turn the wheel at highway speeds . It tracks straight as an arrow , but when driving around a parking lot , the high-effort steering did n't seem so useful . However , it 's reasonable , but it does n't communicate the road to the driver as well as a 1993 Ford Probe GT . IMHO , it 's much better than the steering on my Celica ST . I wonder how bad this car is during winter ? Miscellaneous notes : GRIPES : The rattles from the sunroof is intermittent -- some days it rattles loudly , other days I look up wondering where all the noise went . Activating the sunroof is sometimes very noisy -- loud squealing as it retracts on its rails . I wonder if there is a quick fix for this . Again , other days it completely disappears . ( Function of humidity ? ) Once I made the connection between the sometimes awful feeling suspension and torque steer , I 've never complained about ride . I wish the seats had more support under the thighs . Also , I wish the side bolsters would close more tightly . I hear that tires for this car can get really expensive . I currently have Goodyear GT+4s that cost the previous owner $ 500 for four . I used to hate the Ford stereo systems -- whose idea was it to use a volume *paddle* ? Now , to my amazement , I don't really mind ... and sometimes think it 's an okay idea ! ! ! Pretty ridiculous , though . Getting up to 4000 rpm sometimes seems to be a chore . But , this is no big deal . There is more than enough torque down low . I often goof up the shifting when driving with friends . It took me a couple of days before I could really shift smoothly from 2nd to 3rd gear . ( Hard to believe , is n't it ? ) My car has almost 93,000 miles on it . My parents noted that it is almost impossible to find a low-mileage SHO . Astute observation , IMHO . I wonder how long I can make my SHO last -- I just bought a book titled `` Drive It Forever '' for tips in this department . : - ) The goofy parking brake pedal still throws me for a loop . I once parked the car in gear , and then accidentally let out the clutch after I started it . The car jolted forward , and bounced off the car in front of me -- no paint damage at all , but starting the car is a whole new ritual for me with that fangled pedal ! Also , I began to wonder how strong that brake really is . ( Today , I backed out of parking spot today and started to drive away before I noticed the glowing brake light . Oops . ) The driver 's power window creaks when closed all the way . The same thing happens in my parents 1989 Mercury Sable . Oddly , all the other windows work smoothly . LIKES : I 'm liking the interior amenities more and more each day . The cupholders are great . I did n't expect to use the keyless entry buttons so much , but it really is handy . You can lock all the doors by pressing the 7/8 and 9/10 buttons together ! Neat ! And you can never lock yourself out of the car . I really feel like I do n't deserve this car . I really can't believe that I could afford it . I got this car ten years ahead of schedule . : - ) I love this car so much that I 've been telling my parents to look into buying one . I love this car so much that I wrote this 13K file -- I meant to write a couple of lines and ended up with this . If there were a J.D . Powers Survey for used car owners , I would have an opportunity to express my incredible satisfaction of owning this car . I do n't like thinking about getting another car , but at this point in time , I 'm sure I 'd buy another SHO . For under $ 7000 , you ca n't beat it . ( Next time with an airbag and ABS , though . ) Insurance-wise , this car is also a big win . I pay the same premiums as on my 1987 Toyota Celica -- despite that it has nearly twice the horsepower . Other Odds and Ends : Much to my amazement , there is no SHO mailing list anywhere . Maybe because the _SHO Registry_ publication has filled this void . I have n't joined yet , but I 've noticed that queries about SHOs still appear on rec.autos about once a month . Owners of SHOs are always quick to respond , and are very vocal fans of the cars . ( Maybe some of the most vocal on rec.autos . : - ) I 've put together the responses to my questions about the cars , as well as other posts with useful information on these cars . I 'll be posting this in the form of a FAQ soon . If anyone is interested in starting a mailing list , please speak up ! I do n't know if I have the resources here at Purdue to start one , but maybe someone out there does . Gene Kim ( genek @ mentor.cc.purdue.edu )

From : svec5 @ menudo.uh.edu ( T.C . Zhao ) Subject : Full Color Image Editor for SGI Workstations Organization : University of Houston Lines : 159 Distribution : world NNTP-Posting-Host : menudo.uh.edu I am happy to announce the first public release of the bit program , an INTERACTIVE , FULL COLOR image viewer and editor based on SGI GL . Besides typical touchup tasks , such as crop , rotate , smooth , etc , bit offers some unique features not available in similar programs , such as text and vector support and the separation of text and image . The following is the relevant sections from the man page . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Pre-Release of May , 1993 BIT ( 1L ) NAME bit - Bitmap Image Touchup for SGI Workstations DESCRIPTION bit is an interactive full color image viewer and editor based on Silicon Graphics GL . As a full color program , bit handles images of both 24bits and color index in a natural and efficient manner . As an image viewer , bit allows list of images to be displayed in their original type ( 24bits or color index ) in any order and in any of the many built-in styles of display . You can walk up and down the list using mouse and keyboard , or you can let bit do the walk for you ( The SlideShow ) . With the pan and zoom features , large images can be viewed in full without being limited by the window or screen size . As an image editor , bit performs a large number of image editing and processing tasks accurately and efficiently . It keeps information loss at any stage of the editing process at an absolute minimum by performing subpixel sampling automatically while conserving the input image type whenever possible to avoid unnecessary promotion and/or quantization of input images . You can also cut a piece of an image and paste it into another . In addition , arbitrarily colored and sized text and simple geometric figures can be rendered on top of an image for annotation with the option to make them part of the bitmap or output separately to take advantage of the higher printer resolutions ( e.g . PostScript ) . Bit can also be used as a graphical user interface to many existing image processing programs by defining external bindings which in essence turn command line oriented programs into bit subfunctions and can be accessed by a press of a button , and best of all , the processed image will be read back and displayed immediately . Convolution using exter- nally defined matrices of arbitrary order can be performed dynamically giving great flexibility in processing an image . FEATURES Bit performs all of its image manipulations interactively with a continuous progress report , and once the processing is complete , the processed image will be displayed . Current features include o Rotates an image by an arbitrary angle with the option of anti-aliasing and filling the `` rotated out '' region with an arbitrary color . o Scales an image by arbitrary factors in x- and/or y-directions with the option of subpixel sampling . o Renders text of arbitrary color , size or orientation on top of an image with the option of rendering directly into the raster or saving the text and raster separately , such as into a PostScript file , to take advantage of a higher printer resolution . Besides normal text strings , many predefined special symbols can be input conveniently as in TeX ( 1 ) , e.g. , $ \alpha $ \small $ \beta $ produces Greek alphabet alpha followed by a slightly smaller Greek alphabet beta . o Presents graphically the histogram of an image . o Performs arbitrary 1-to-1 pixel transformation . The transformation function can be specified interactively and can be of arbitrary forms . Further , the transformation can be applied to RGB channels separately or simultaneously and to the entire image or a portion of it . Many difficult tasks , such as thresholding , can be accomplished rather easily by 1-to-1 transformation in combination with the avai- lability of graphical histograms of the image . o Places simple geometric figures ( SGFs ) , e.g. , arrows , circles , trian- gles etc. , of arbitrary color , size and orientation into an image at arbitrary locations addressed either in absolute pixels or in some user definable coordinate system units , with the option of rendering directly into the raster or save the sgfs and raster separately ( e.g , PostScript file ) . All SGFs can be scaled in x- and y-directions independently or simultaneously ( this is how to get an ellipse from a circle ) . o Performs edge detection . In combination with image histograms and 1- to-1 transformation , very accurate result can be obtained . o Performs histogram equalization . o Performs convolution with externally defined ( square ) matrices of arbitrary order . o Crops a rectangular portion of an image . o Cuts and pastes across images . o Magnifies any portion of an image by any amount . o Displays a list of images in sequence with a user specifiable pause interval between images . ( SlideShow ) o Measures RGB intensities of a pixel at any location or all pixels along an arbitrary line with the result presented as RGB intensities or as an intensity vs. distance plot . o Performs image type conversions . o Converts image formats . o Smoothes an image ( Special convolution ) . o Filters an image by external programs and read the filtered image back and display it . o Modify an individual pixel 's RGB values . o Performs FFT on the entire image or a portion of it and display the resulting power spectra . o Spray and brush paint in full color ( unavailable in this pre-release ) . SUPPORTED FORMATS o IRIS RGB , native to SGI IRIS o JPEG ( JFIF ) format o CompuServ GIF o PNM ( Portable Any Map ) , including PPM , PGM and PBM . o XBM ( X Window Bitmap ) o TIFF o PostScript ( Write only ) Hardware requirements : -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Any SGI workstation that supports RGBmode ( ) , including indigoes . Where to get it : -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - anonymous ftp to monte.svec.uh.edu /pub/bit/bitxxx.tar.Z where xxx is the version number . Current version is 0.73 Read src/01Readme for installation instructions after unpacking Acknowledgement : -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - JPEG support is based on the Independent JPEG groups 's library Version 4 . FORMS library , developed by Mark Overmars , is used for GUI . Both JPEG and FORMS library are included in this release . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Bit is the program you will ever need to view and annotate images ; The built-in editing features will satisfy most of your editing needs .

He promises to be there for you , but you have to look for yourself . Those who doubt this or dispute it have not givin it a sincere effort . Simple logic arguments are folly . If you read the Bible you will see that Jesus made fools of those who tried to trick him with `` logic '' . Our ability to reason is just a spec of creation . Yet some think it is the ultimate . If you rely simply on your reason then you will never know more than you do now . To learn you must accept that which you do n't know .
From : tedwards @ eng.umd.edu ( Thomas Grant Edwards ) Subject : Need info on Waco , Machineguns Organization : Project GLUE , University of Maryland , College Park Lines : 23 NNTP-Posting-Host : pipa.src.umd.edu A really sad op-ed appeared in my school 's newpaper today . It claimed that full-auto weapons are illegal in the U.S . I understand that full-auto weapons made and registered before May 19 , 1986 are still legal in 40 of the 50 states . Is Texas one of those states ? Can anyone point me to a source for info on how many people have been killed by legal full-auto weapons in the U.S. ? And finally , I think it would be great if anyone was keeping a digest of facts on the Waco incident . In particular , I would like a source for the FBI/BATF mentioning the supposed methamphetamine lab , and information on the beginning of the raid , specifically BATF lies . I am also interested in past BATF no-knock warrents which have lead to personal and property damage against innocent citizens . I intend to put together a reply to this op-ed very soon . The author of the piece states he wants to work for the BATF . gack ! -Thomas

The following moderators have been proposed and agreed upon : Moderator : Nabeel A. Rana < rana @ rintintin.colorado.edu > Co-Moderator : Dr. Tahir Ijaz < ijaz @ ccu.umanitoba.ca > A BRIEF DESCRIPTION ABOUT AHMADIYYA ISLAM : =============================================== The Ahmadiyya Movement in Islam , an international organi- sation , was found in 1889 in Qadian , India . The founder of this movement , Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad ( 1835-1908 ) , was proclaimed to be the Promised Reformer of this age as foretold in the Scriptures of almost all major religions of the world . He claimed to be the fulfillment of the long awaited second comming of Jesus Christ ( metaphorically ) , the Muslim Mahdi , and the Promised Messiah . The claims of Hazrat Ahmad raised storms of hostility and extreme opposition , which are often witnessed in the history of divine reformers . Even today this sect is being persecuted especial- ly in some of the Muslim regimes . The right of Ahmadi Muslims to openly practice their religion and to define themselves as Muslims has been severely restricted in many Muslim Countries . The United Nations , human rights organizations such as Amnesty International and top leaderships of some countries have voiced their concerns against this denial of basic human and civil liberaties to the members of this movement , but so far to no avail . Despite the opposition and persecution , the movement cont- inues to grow with a current membership of millions from around the world in over 130 countries , who come from diverse ethnic and cul- tural backgrounds . The movement is devoted to world peace and strives towards developing a better understanding of all religions . Ahmadi Muslims have always been opposed to all forms of violence , bigotry , reli- gious intolerance and fundamentalism . Among its many philanthropic activities , the sect has es- tablished a network of hundreds of schools , hospitals , and clinics in many third world countries . These institutions are staffed by volunteer professionals and are fully financed by the movement's internal resources . The movement stresses the importance of educa- tion and leadership . Its members have included a high number of professionals as well as world class individuals . The Ahmadiyya mission is to bring about a universal moral reform , establish peace and justice , and to unite mankind under one universal brotherhood . NEWSGROUP CREATION : ================== The discussion for this proposed newsgroup has now offi- cially ended . Voting will be held for three weeks . If the news- group gets 2/3rd majority AND 100 more `` YES/Create '' votes than '' NO/do n't create '' votes ; the newsgroup shall be created . ABOUT THE VOTE-TAKER : ==================== Mr. Anthony Lest has been asked by the proponents of this newsgroup to act as an official impartial vote-taker for the proposed newsgroup . He has no objection to use his workstation for the purpose of vote-taking . Neither the University of Colora- do , nor Anthony Lest has anything to do with the proposal of the newsgroup . They are just collecting the votes as a neutral third party . QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS : ===================== Any questions or comments about the proposed newsgroup may be sent to : Nabeel A.

Not to mention that Lankford had been hurt two nights before running into the outfield wall . This being the reason he was available to pinch- anything .

I have , however , no desire whatsoever to use a version of os/2 which wont REALLY do what it says ( i.e . run windows apps ) OS/2 2.0-2.1 will not run windows apps in 386 enhansed mode , something that most larger windows apps require , but OS/2 2.2 , which is supposed to be in beta test , is supposed to . I have heard that os/2 2.2 beta is available via ftp , and I was wondering if anyone knew where to obtain a copy . I would appreciate any information , as I would like , once and for all , to establish for myself which is the best os for my needs . - > Robbie < - z_shererrg.sfasu.edu

I could n't agree more . The Jays have a lot of power in their line-up . So far pitching has been the biggest problem . Maybe we can get Acker back ? : - ) > But anyway the point of my post , if you missed it , was that Derek Bell was > traded because he was basically in the doghouse with Cito and the rest of > the team . One incident that sticks out in my mind was when Derek Bell ran back out on to the feild after the Jays had won the division and all the players were back in the clubhouse . Bell ran around the field with his arms in the air , waving a big towel over his head . He looked like a big jerk , especially when you consider he did not contribute much to the team over the whole season . The next day , Winfield and Carter somehow got the keys to Bell's Jeep and brought it out on to the feild before the game started . The stadium announcer said that there was going to be a draw later in the game for Bell's jeep . Bell really freaked out . I do n't think Bell was to popular after that . I think that Jackson might be trying a little too hard right now . He 's known for being a great outfielder , and he 's not the only Blue Jay who has been booting balls and playing generally awful . andrew -- ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...

If not required , it ought to be for high-low beams . There might be a wee problem with this . If you use both filaments at the same time , the bulb is tossing out a great deal more heat than normal . Possibly enough to shorten it 's life span . My Honda CRX cage [ a cage that really wanted to be a bike ] had wimpy stock lights . So we used to run around with both beams on . Made a mucho big difference - until both low beam filaments died nearly simultaneously ! This was two weeks after finding out how nice it was to use both beams . I replaced the lights with quartz-halogen lights and that ended the problem .

I would think that would be great _fun_ , not having ever felt the joy and peace the Christians speak of with a longing gaze . This is not what I got when I believed - I just tried to hide my fear of getting punished for something I never was sure of . The Bible is hopelessly confusing for someone who wants to know for sure . God did not answer . In the end , I found I had been following a mass delusion , a lie . I ca n't believe in a being who refuses to give a slightest hint of her existence . > Obviously there are many Christians who have tried and do believe . So .. ? I suggest they should honestly reconsider the reasons why they believe and analyse their position . In fact , it is amusing to note in this context that many fundamentalist publications tell us exactly the opposite - one should not examine one 's belief critically . I 'll tell you something I left out of my 'testimony ' I posted to this group two months ago . A day after I finally found out my faith is over , I decided to try just one more time . The same cycle of emotional responses fired once again , but this time the delusion lasted only a couple of hours . I told my friend in a phone that it really works , thank god , just to think about it again when I hung up . I had to admit that I had lied , and fallen prey to the same illusion . > No one asks you to swallow everything , in fact Jesus warns against it . But let > me ask you a question . Do you beleive what you learn in history class , or for > that matter anything in school . I mean it 's just what other people have told > you and you do n't want to swallow what others say . right ... ? I used to believe what I read in books when I was younger , or what other people told me , but I grew more and more skeptical the more I read . I learned what it means to use _reason_ . As a student of chemistry , I had to perform a qualitative analysis of a mixture of two organic compounds in the lab . I _hated_ experiments like this - they are old-fashioned and increase the student 's workload considerably . Besides , I had to do it twice , since I failed in my first attempt . However , I think I 'll never forget the lesson : No matter how strongly you believe the structure of the unknown is X , it may still be Y . It is _very_ tempting to jump into conclusions , take a leap of faith , assure oneself , ignore the data which is inconsistent . But it can still be wrong . I found out that I was , after all , using exactly the same mechanism to believe in god - mental self-assurance , suspension of fear , filtering of information . In other words , it was only me , no god playing any part . > The life , death , and resurection of Christ is documented historical fact . Oh ? And I had better believe this ? Dan , many UFO stories are much better documented than the resurrection of Jesus . The resurrection is documented quite haphazardly in the Bible - it seems the authors did not pay too much attention to which wild rumour to leave out . Besides , the ends of the gospels probably contain later additions and insertions ; for instance , the end of Mark ( 16:9-20 ) is missing from many early texts , says my Bible . Jesus may have lived and died , but he was probably misunderstood . > As much > as anything else you learn . How do you choose what to believe and > what not to ? This is easy . I believe that the world exists independent of my mind , and that logic and reason can be used to interpret and analyse what I observe . Nothing else need to be taken on faith , I will go by the evidence . It makes no difference whether I believe George Washington existed or not . I assume that he did , considering the vast amount of evidence presented . > There is no way to get into a sceptical heart .

Were you ever willing to > die for what you believed ? A liar , how do you know what my attitude was ? Try reading your Bible again . I was willing to die for my faith . Those who do are usually remembered as heroes , at least among those who believe . Dan , do you think I'm lying when I say I believed firmly for 15 years ? It seems it is very difficult to admit that someone who has really believed does not do so anymore . But I ca n't go on lying to myself . Blind trust is dangerous , and I was just another blind led by the blind . But if god really wants me , she 'll know what to do . I 'm willing . I just do n't know whether she exists - looking at the available evidence , it looks like she does n't . Petri -- ___ . .'* '' . * Petri Pihko kem-pmp @ Mathematics is the Truth . ! ___ . '* ' .

I 've recently decided to chuck the linear regulators and learn the `` black magic '' art of switching power supplies ... ( before anyone flames me , I KNOW , both have their place : - ) Anyways , I 've built the basic up & down converters with pretty good results ( > 80 % efficiency ) but I 'm running into problems when I try to design & build anything that puts out serious amps ... I know it can be done ( I have some 5V @ 200A guts on my bench ) but something puzzles me : I 'm using a simple choke as the storage element ( basicly a toroid with a single winding ) but ALL commercial models use transformers with MANY windings . I traced a few and they seem to use some of the winding for the usual error/feedback but some of the others seem to loose me ... What are they for ? Better than that , anyone have a full schematic for one of these that I could get a copy of ? I'd love to see how they manage to squeeze out so much from such low volume : - ) My other problems ( in getting high amps & good efficiency ) are 1 ) Lack of sources of ideal components ( calculated ) and 2 ) Limited knowledge of the whole topic ... I 'm doing this on my own ( not school ) mind you ( in fact , I have yet to take any course that covers transistors ; - ) So , is the answer to # 1 the accumulation of dead commercial models and truning into a scavanger ( not that it 's not what I 'm doing now ... ) and # 2 getting & understanding schematics and a bit more of the [ mind-boggling ] theory ?

Most JPEG viewers seem to require specific video drivers since they support only specific video cards . Some have the standard IBM BIOS video support for the VGA 320x200 256 colour mode , but they leave out the other cards such as the Hercules monochrome card ( which by the way can give very good picture quality if your dithering works right ) . I ca n't remember the name of a JPEG viewer since I usually convert JPEG 's to GIF 's before viewing them . But some require VESA driver for the video cards . You do n't need any special hardware to view JPEG 's except perhaps for a VGA card and maybe a 286+ processor . Most people these days program for 286+ computers and neglect the rest of the 86 processors ( 8086 , 8088 ) . I have a 8088 clone ( a NEC V20 processor ) and a Hercules card , I have had to write some programs so that they will view GIF 's and animations for the VGA and other colour graphics boards on my monochrome Hercules card . I use Floyd-Steinberg dithers and have found that if one does something neat with the colour palette the resulting dithered image gives much greater detail than it normally would when viewed on other monochrome systems . CompuShow 8.50 has FS dithering but it does the standard thing with the image palette before dithering , my way gives a brighter more detailed image . Anyway , enough of my rambling in the wrong direction . The final point is , as far as I know , you do n't need extra hardware to view JPEG 's other than the VGA ( and perhaps a 286 or better ) Have a day ! Gerry .

From : fortmann @ superbowl.und.ac.za ( Paul Fortmann - PG ) Subject : Praying for Justice Organization : University Of Natal ( Durban ) Lines : 650 I recently came across this article which I found interesting . I have posted it to hear what other people feel about the issue . I realise it is rather long ( 12 pages in Wordperfect ) by may well be worth the read . Except for the first page ( which I typed ) the rest was scanned inusing Omnipage . Some of the f 's have come out as t 's and visa-versa . I have tried to correct as much as possible . ABOUT THE AUTHOR Peter Hammond is the founder of Frontline Fellowship , a missionary organisation witnessing to the communist countries in Southern Africa . He has also made several visits to many East European countries . FRONTLINE FELLOWSHIP NEWS ISSN 1018-144X PRAYING FOR JUSTICE ( by Peter Hammond ) To those involved in ministering to Christians suffering persecution the imprecatory Psalms are a tremendous source of comfort . And those of us who are fighting for the right to life of the preborn , or battling social evils such as pornography or crime , are beginning to appreciate what an important weapon God has entrusted to us in the imprecatory Psalms . THE IMPRECATORY PSALMS Early in my Christian walk I encountered the prayers for judgement in the Psalms and was quite at loss to know how to respond to them . Prayers such as : '' Break the arm of the wicked and evil men ; call him to account for his wickedness ... '' Psalm 10:15 did not seem consistent with the gospel of love which I had accepted . Yet Psalm 10:15 was clearly motivated by love for God ( `` The Lord is King for ever and ever ; the nation will perish from His land '' 10:16 , and `` Why does the wicked man revile God ? 10:13 ) , and by love for the innocent who suffer ( `` You hear , O Lord , the desire of the afflicted ; You encourage them , and You listen to their cry , defending the fatherless and oppressed , in order that man , who is of the earth , may terrify no more . '' 10:17-18 ) Nevertheless , I grew increasingly uncomfortable reading such graphic prayers for God to judge the wicked as : `` Pour out your wrath on them ; let Your fierce anger overtake them '' 64:24 ; `` O Lord , the God avenges , O God who avenges , shine forth . Rise up , O Judge of the earth , pay back to the proud what they deserve . '' 95:1-2 ; `` Break the teeth in their mouths , O God ; ... let them vanish like water .. let their arrows be blunted ... The righteous will be glad when they are avenged , when they bathe their feet in the blood of the wicked . Then men will way , `` Surely the righteous still are rewarded ; surely there is a God who judges the earth . ' '' 58:6-11 Certainly I wanted God to be honoured and yes I was deeply destressed by the prevalence of evil - but could I actually pray for God to `` pour out His wrath '' on the wicked ? The scripture make it clear that these prayers are not to be prayed for own selfish motives , nor against our personal enemies . Rather they are to be prayed in Christ , for His glory and against His enemies . The psalmist describes the targets of these imprecation as : those who devise injustice in their heart and whose hands mete out violence ( 58:2 ) those who `` boast of evil '' and `` are a disgrace in the eyes of God . Your tongue plots destruction , it is like a sharpened razor , and you who practise deceit . You love evil rather than good , falsehood rather than speaking the truth . '' 52:1-3 ; `` They crush your people ... They slay the widow and the alien ; they murder the fatherless . '' 94:5- 6 ; `` With cunning they conspire against Your people ; they plot against those You cherish . '' 83:3 ; `` You hate all who do wrong . You destroy those who tell lies ; bloodthirsty and deceitful men the Lord abhors . '' 5:5-6 . To those unrepentant enemies of God the psalmist declares : '' Surely God will bring you down to everlasting ruin '' 52:5 ; '' Surely God will crush the heads of His enemies ... of those who go on in their sins '' 68:21 . And the purpose of these prayers for justice is declared : `` Then it will be known to the ends of the earth that God rules ... '' 59:13 ; `` to proclaim the powers of God '' 68:34 ; `` All kings will bow down to Him and all nations will serve Him `` 72:11 ; `` Who knows the power of Your anger ? For Your wrath is as great as the fear that is due You. `` 90:11 Yet despite the fact that 90 of the 150 Psalms include imprecations ( prayers invoking God 's righteous judgement upon the wicked ) such prayers are rare in the average Western church . However , amongst the persecuted churches these prayers are much more common . PRAYING AGAINST THE PERSECUTORS Amidst the burnt out churches and devastation of Marxist Angola I found the survivors of communist persecution including the crippled and maimed , and widows and orphans praying for God to strike down the wicked and remove the persecutors of the Church . I was shocked - yet it was Biblical ( Even the martyrs in heaven pray `` How long , Sovereign Lord , holy and true , until you judge the inhabitants of the earth and avenge our blood ? '' Revelation 6:10 ) . The initiator of the communist persecution in Angola was Agestino Neto . Described as a `` drunken , psychotic , marxist poet '' , Neto had been installed by Cuban troops as the first dictator of Angola . He boasted that : `` Within 20 years there wo n't be a Bible or a church left in Angola . I will have eradicated Christianity . '' Yet despite the vicious wave of church burning and massacres it is not Christianity that was eradicated in Angola but Agestino Neto . Neto died in mysterious circumstances on an operating table in Moscow . In Romania I learnt of a series of remarkable incidents recorded of God judging the persecutors of the Church in answer to prayer : * A communist official ordered a certain pastor to be arrested . the next day the official died of a heart attack . * Another communist party official ordered that all the Bibles in his district were to be collected and pulped , to be turned into toilet paper . This blasphemous project was in fact carried out . But the next day when the official was medically examined , he was informed that he had terminal cancer . He died shortly afterwards . * On another occasion , a communist official who had ordered a Baptist church to be demolished by bulldozers died in a car crash the very next day . * When an order was given to dismantle a place of worship on the mountainside in a forest , the workmen flatly refused to carry out the order . At gunpoint a group of conscripted gypsies also refused to touch the church . In desperation , the communist police forced prisoners at bayonet-point to dismantle the structure . Yet the officer in charge pleaded with the local Christians to pray for him , that God would not judge him . He emphasised that he had nothing against Christians and was only obeying strict orders . The building was in fact reconstructed later , and again used for worship . `` They were all seized with Sear and the Name of the Lord Jesus was held in high honour ... in this way the Word of the Lord spread widely and grew in power. `` Acts 19:17,20 Nicolae Ceaucescu the dictator who ordered much of the persecution in Romania was overthrown by his own army and executed on Christmas day , 1989 , to joyous shouts of `` the antiChrist is dead '' in the streets . Many testified that this was in answer to the fervent prayers of the long suffering people of Romania . Another persecutor of the Church who challenged God was Samora Machel , the first dictator of Marxist Mozambique . Samora Machel was a cannibal who ate human flesh in witchcraft ceremonies in the 1960 's . He pledged his soul to Satan and vowed that he would destroy the Church and turn Mozambique into the first truly Marxist-Leninist state in Africa . Thousands of churches in Mozambique were closed confiscated , `` nationalised '' chained and padlocked , burnt down or boarded up . Missionaries were expelled , some being imprisoned first . Evangelism was forbidden . Bibles were ceremonially burnt and tens of thousands of Christians , including many pastors and elders , were shipped off to concentration camps - most were never seen again . A month before his sudden death Samora Machel cursed God publicly and challenged Him to prove His existence by striking him ( Machel ) dead . On 19 October 1986 , while several churches were specifically praying for God to stop the persecution in Mozambique , Machel 's Soviet Tupelov aircraft crashed in a violent thunderstorm . The plane crashed 200 metres within South Africa's boundary with Mozambique . Amidst the wreckage the marxist plans for overthrowing the government of Malawi were discovered and published . Not only had God judged a blasphemer and a persecutor , but He had also saved a country from persecution . In the months leading up to the first multi-party elections in Zambia many churches fasted and prayed tor God to remove the 27 year socialist dictatorship of Kenneth Kaunda . This was done on 31st October 1991 when Fredrick Chiluba ( a man converted to Christ whilst imprisoned for opposing Kaunda ) was elected president of Zambia and covenanted to make Zambia a Christian country . It is recorded in history that the wicked Mary , Queen of Scots , declared trembling and in tears : `` I am more afraid of John Knox's prayers than of an army of ten thousand '' . On 3 April 1993 the Secretary General of the South African Communist Party Chris Hani was shot dead . From the unprecedented international wave of condolences and adulation reported one could be forgiven for assuming that this man was a saint and a martyr . Certainly it was not the death and resurrection of Christ Jesus which dominated the thoughts and headlines of South Africa this Easter , but the assassination of Chris Hani . The stunning hypocrisy of the situation is that 20 135 people were murdered in South Africa in 1992 , yet more collective concern and anguish were reported over the death of the head of the SA Communist Party than for all the thousands of other victims . Indeed the SA government , the international community and the mass media have apparently had greater sorrow reported over this one death than for all the 50 000 South Africans murdered since 2nd February 1990 when the ANC , SACP and PAC were unbanned ! Yet as a member of the ANC Revolutionary Council since 1973 , Deputy Commander of Umkhonto we Sizwe ( MK ) the ANC 's `` military wing '' - from 1982 , and Chief of Staff of MK from 1987 , Chris Hani had approved and ordered bombings and assassinations of many unarmed civilians . As Jesus warned : `` all who live by the sword will die by the sword `` Matt 26:52 . After personally confronting Hani about his terrorist activities at a press conference in Washington DC ( where he publicly declared his support for Fidel Castro , Col. Gaddafi , Yasser Arafat and Saddam Hussein and defended the placing of car bombs and limpet mines in public places during `` the struggle '' ) I told him that I was a Christian and , while I did n't hate him , I did hate communism and I was praying for him - that God would either bring him to repentance and salvation in Christ , or that God would remove him . He responded by swearing and declaring that he was an atheist . Several other people also prayed that God would either bring Hani to repentance or remove him . Similarly several churches in America have begun to pray the imprecatory Psalms against unrepentant abortionists . In one town 8 abortionists were struck down , with heart attacks , strokes , car accidents and cancer , within months of these public prayers for God to stop these killers of preborn babies . Some praised God for His righteous acts of judgement and quoted : '' When justice is done , it brings joy to the righteous and terror to evildoers `` Proverbs 21:15 . Others were shocked that any Christian could express satisfaction at the misfortune of any - even of the blatantly wicked . Yet the Apostles prayed imprecatory prayers ( Acts 13:8-12 ; Galatians 1:8-9 ; 2 Tim 4:14-15 ) and so did our Lord ( Matt 11:20-24 ) . What then should our attitude towards the imprecatory Psalms be ? Should we be praying the Psalms ? To tackle these thorny issues I would like to present a short summary of an excellent book , `` War Psalms of the Prince of Peace - Lessons From The Imprecatory Psalms '' by James E Adams , ( published by the Presbyterian and Reformed Publishing Company ) : Our Lord Jesus Christ & His apostles used the Psalms constantly in teaching men to know God . The New Testament ( NT ) quotes the Old Testament ( OT ) over 283 times . 41 % of all OT quotes in the NT are from the Psalms . Christ Himself alluded to the Psalms over 50 times . The Psalms are the Prayer Book of the Bible . 1 . Are the imprecatory Psalms the oracles of God ? Some Christian commentators & theologians reject these Psalms as '' devilish '' , `` diabolical `` , `` unsuited to the church '' , and `` Not God 's pronouncements of His wrath on the wicked ; but the prayers of a man for vengeance on his enemies , just the opposite of Jesus' teaching that we should love our enemies. `` Yet 2 Tim 3:16-17 declares : '' All Scripture is God breathed and is useful for teaching , rebuking , correcting and training in righteousness , so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work. `` ( see also 2 Peter 3:15-16 ) . The fact that something in the Word of God is beyond our comprehension is not grounds to denying or even questioning its inspiration . To make ourselves the judge of what is good or evil is to impudently take the place of God . Do we imagine ourselves to be holier than God ? Wrong ideas of God have led many to become `` evangelic plastic surgeons who have made it their job to `` clean up '' God 's Word according to their own ideas of what is proper . They have forgotten that it is God alone who must determine what Christianity is and what is suitable for His Church . The essence of what many have done is to question the authority of God 's Word ( like Eve 's original sin of listening to Satan 's question `` Yes , hath God said ... ? '' ) . The Psalms are part of God 's revelation of Himself and His attributes , and they are reaffirmed by the NT as the authoritative Word of God . Those imprecatory Psalms which these evangelical plastic surgeons reject as `` unsuited '' and `` unworthy '' for the Church are the very Psalms Christ used to testify about Himself ( eg : Mark 12:36 ; Matt 22:43-44 ) and which the Apostles used as authoritative Scripture ( eg : Acts 1:16-20 ; Acts 4:25 ; Heb 4:7 ) . See also : 2 Samuel 23:1-2 . CH Spurgeon said concerning the imprecatory Psalms , ( especially Ps 109 ) : '' Truly this is one of the hard places of Scripture , a passage which the soul trembles to read , yet it is not ours to sit in judgement upon it , but to bow our ear to what the Lord would speak to us therein. `` The rejection of any part of God 's Word is a rejection of the giver of that Word , God Himself . 2. Who is praying these Psalms ? Christ quoted the Psalms not merely as prophesy ; He actually spoke the Psalms as His own words . The Psalms occupied an enormous place in the life of our Lord . He used it as His prayer book and song book - from the Synagogue to the festivals and at the Last Supper . On the cross Christ quoted from the Psalms - not as some ancient authority that He adapted for His own use , but as His very own words - the words of the Lord 's Anointed - which as David 's Son He truly was . `` Father , into your hands I commit my Spirit '' Ps 31:5 '' My God , My God , why have you forsaken me ? '' Ps 22:1 In His ministry Christ foretells what He will say as the Judge on the day of judgement , and He quotes the Psalms in doing so ! Matt 7:23 `` Then I will tell them plainly , ' I never knew you . Away from me , you evildoers'. `` Ps 6:8 In Heb 10:5 the apostle attributes Ps 40:6-8 directly to Christ although nowhere in the Gospels is Christ recorded as having said these words . Similarly Hebrews 2 : 12 attributes Ps 22:22 directly to Christ despite there being no record of His having spoken these words while on earth . Clearly the apostles believed Christ is speaking in the Psalms . Christ came to establish His kingdom and to extend His mercy in all the earth . But let us never forget that Jesus will come again to execute Judgement on the wicked . David as the anointed king of the chosen people of God was a prototype of Jesus Christ . Acts 2:30 : '' being therefore a prophet , ... he foresaw and spoke of the resurrection of Christ. `` David was a witness to Christ in his office , in his lite , and in his words . The same words which David spoke , the future Messiah spoke through him . The prayers of David were prayed also by Christ . Or better Christ Himself prayed these Psalms through His forerunner David . The imprecatory Psalms are expressions of the infinite justice of God , of His indignation against wrong doing , and His compassion for the wronged . 3 . But what about the Psalms of repentance ? Christ is also the Lamb of God , the substitutionary sacrifice for our sins . Christ in the day of His crucifixion was charged with the sin of His people . He appropriated to Himself those debts for which He had made Himself responsible . Our Lord was the substitution for the sinner . He took the sinners place ( Isaiah 53 ) . `` God made Him who had no sin to be sin for us , so that in Him we might become the righteousness of God. `` 2 Cor 5:21 In history the Psalms , especially the imprecatory Psalms , have been understood to have been the prayers of Christ by : St Augustine , Jerome , Ambrose , Tertullian , Luther and many others . All the Psalms are the voice of Christ . Christ is praying the imprecatory Psalms ! All the Psalms are messianic . It is the Lord Jesus Christ who is praying these prayers of vengeance . It is only right for the righteous King of Peace to ask God to destroy His enemies . These prayers signal an alarm to all who are still enemies of King Jesus . His prayers will be answered ! God 's Word is revealed upon all who oppose Christ . Anyone who rejects God 's way of forgiveness in the cross of Christ will bear the dreadful curses of God . He who prays Psalm 69:23-28 will one day make this prayer a reality when He declares to those on His left : '' Depart from me you who are cursed into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. `` Matt 25:41 All the enemies of the Lord need to hear these Psalms . *God's Kingdom is at War . * The powers of evil will tall and God alone will reign forever ! `` With justice He judges and makes war ... out of His mouth comes a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations . He will rule them with an iron sceptre ; He treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God Almighty ... King of Kings and Lord of Lords. `` Rev 19 : 15 4 . Are Jesus ' prayers contradictory ? What about Jesus ' command to love our enemies and to bless those who curse us ( Matt 5:44 ) ? Christ is of course the loving and merciful Saviour who forgives sin ; but He is also the awesome Judge who is coming in Judgement on those who disobey His Gospel . `` God is just . He will pay back trouble to those who trouble you and give relief to you who are troubled ... This will happen when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with His powerful angels . He will punish those who do not obey the Gospel of our Lord Jesus . They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord and from the majesty of His power on the day He comes to be glorified in His holy people and to be marvelled at among au those who have believed. `` 2 Thess 1:6-10 Jesus has power on earth to forgive sins , and He has power on earth to execute judgement upon His enemies . In the Psalms we see both the vengeance and the love ot God . Even in the N.T . & in the Gospels we see imprecations . `` Woe to you , ... hypocrites ... blind guides ... blind fools ... full of greed and self indulgence ... whitewashed tombs ... you snakes ! You brood of vipers ! How will you escape being condemned to Hell ? `` Matt 23 In Matt 26:23-24 Christ quotes from Ps 69 and 109 to refer to His betrayal by Judas . We also need to acknowledge that Christ 's prayers of blessing are not for all . In John 17:6-9 it is clear that Christ is only praying to the elect of God - those who have : '' obeyed your Word '' ... `` accepted '' God 's Word ... and have '' believed `` . ( see Luke 10:8-16 - Those who reject the message of God 's kingdom will be judged . ) 5 . May we pray the imprecatory Psalms ? Martin Luther pointed out that when one prays : `` Hallowed be Thy Name , Thy Kingdom come , Thy will be done `` then `` he must put all the opposition to this in one pile and say : 'Curses , maledictions and disgrace upon every other name and every other kingdom . May they be ruined and torn apart and may all their schemes and wisdom and plans run aground ' . `` To pray tor the extension of God 's kingdom is to solicit the destruction of all other kingdoms , eg : Dan 2:44 : `` The God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed ... it will crush all those kingdoms and bring them to an end , but it will itself endure forever. `` * Advance and victory for the Church means defeat and retreat for the kingdom of darkness . * There is a life & death struggle between two kingdoms . The Church can not exclude hatred tor satan 's kingdom from its love for God's kingdom . God 's kingdom can not come without satan 's kingdom being destroyed . God 's will can not be done on earth without the destruction of evil . The glory of God demands the destruction of evil . Instead of being influenced by a sickly sentimentalism which insists upon the assumed , but really non-existent , rights of man - we should focus instead upon the rights of God . Note Psalm 83 where the Psalmist prays against those who `` plot together '' against God and His people : '' Cover their faces with shame so that men will seek your Name O Lord ... Do to them as You did to Midian , as you did to Sisera and Jabin at the river Kishon , who perished at Endor and became like refuse on the ground. `` The story of Sisera in the book of Judges ( Chapter 4 and 5 ) provides a vivid example of God 's judgement on the wicked . Sisera '' cruelly oppressed the Israelites for twenty years '' and they '' cried to the Lord for help '' Judges 4:3 . In response to those prayers : `` The Lord routed Sisera and all his chariots and army by the sword , and Sisera abandoned his chariot and fled on foot ... All the troops of Sisera fell by the sword ; not a man was left. `` Judges 4:15-16 The account then goes on to describe how Sisera escaped to the tent of Jael where she lulled him into a false sense of safety and then drove a tent peg through his temple with a hammer . The song of victory by Deborah and Barak celebrated the crushing of the head of Sisera in graphic detail ( Judges 5:25-27 ) . And it is this that Psalm 83 implores God to again do to His enemies.. `` As you did to Sisera ... '' 6 . The blessings of obedience and the curse of disobedience The imprecatory Psalms are fully consistent with the Law of God : `` If you do not carefully follow all the words of this Law , which are written in this book , and do not revere this glorious and awesome Name - the Lord your God - the Lord will send fearful plagues on you and your descendants . He will bring upon you all the diseases of Egypt that you dreaded , and they will cling to you . The Lord will also bring on you every kind of sickness and disaster not recorded in this Book of the Law until you are destroyed ... because you did not obey the Lord your God ... so it will please Him to ruin and destroy you . You will be uprooted from the land you are entering to possess. `` Deuteronomy 28:58-63 The covenant God made with His people included curses for disobedience as well as blessings for obedience . Deuteronomy 27 records the formal giving and receiving of the covenant terms in an awesome account : '' The Levites shall recite to all the people of Israel in a loud voice : '' Cursed is the man who carves an image or casts an idol - a thing detestable to the Lord , the work of the craftsman 's hands - and sets it up in secret. `` Then all the people shall say , `` Amen ! '' `` '' Cursed is the man who dishonours his father or his mother ... '' Cursed is the man who moves his neighbour 's boundary stone ... '' Cursed is the man who leads the blind astray on the roads ... '' Cursed is the man who withholds justice from the alien , the fatherless or the widow ... '' Cursed is the man who kills his neighbour secretly ... '' Cursed is the man who accepts a bribe to kill an innocent person . `` Cursed is the man who does not uphold the words of the Law by carrying them out . Then all the people shall say , `` Amen ! '' `` Deut 27:14-26 The New Testament confirms that the inevitable consequence of rejecting Christ is the curse . `` If anyone does not love the Lord - a curse be on him. `` 1 Corinthians 16:22 ( See also : Romans 12:19-21 ; Hebrews 1:1-3 ; 3:7-12 ; 3:1519 ; 10:26- 31 ; 12:14-29 . ) 7 . How can we preach these prayers ? The Church of Jesus Christ is an army under orders . Scripture constitutes the official dispatch from the Commander- in-Chief . But we have a problem : those who are called to pass on those orders to others are refusing to do so . How then can we expect to be a united , effective army ? Is it any wonder that the troops have lost sight of their commission to demolish the strongholds of the kingdom of darkness ? If the Church does not hear the battle cries of her Captain , how will she follow Him onto the battlefield ? Pastors are commissioned to pass on the orders of the Church's Commander , never withholding or changing His words . One whose job is to carry dispatches to troops in wartime would face certain and severe punishment if he dared to amend the general 's orders . The pastor 's charge is of greater importance than that of a courier in any earthly army . There 's no place tor the dispatcher to decide he does n't agree with his Commander 's strategy . When Jesus Christ sent seventy-two disciples on a preaching mission , He told them to proclaim the coming of God 's Kingdom ( Lk 10:9 ) - that is , to announce that people must submit to God's rule in their lives . Jesus instructed them to pray for peace on any house they approach , assuring them that if anyone rejected it , the peace would return on the disciples ( verse 5 ) . But we must consider what He said they should do if their message were rejected - that is , if the hearers persisted in rebellion against God 's rule - `` But when you enter a town and are not welcomed , go into its 'streets and say , 'Even the dust of your town that sticks to our feet we wipe off against you . Yet be sure of this : The kingdom of God is near '' ' Luke 10:11 . What would be the result of that denunciation ? I tell you , it will be more bearable on that day for Sodom [ on which God sent fire from Heaven in judgement for its wickedness ] than for that town ( verse 12 ) . Immediately Jesus added curses on Korazin , Bethsaida , and Capernaum tor their rejection of His message ( verses 13-15 ) . He then explained to the disciples the great authority He had given them : `` He who listens to you listens to Me ; he who rejects you rejects Me ; but he who rejects Me rejects him who sent Me `` ( verse 16 ) . This is the fundamental basis tor calling down God 's curses on anyone : his persistent rebellion against God 's authority expressed in His Law and the ministry of His servants . We need to clearly and forcefully proclaim the war cries of the Prince of Peace . Only then will the Church awake from its lethargy and once again enter the battle . If we tail to pass on the battle cry then a lack of urgency and confusion in the ranks will be inevitable . Like Psalm 1 our preaching needs to clearly show the blessings of obedience and the curse of disobedience . The eternal truth is that God can not be mocked . Whatever a man sows - that shall he reap ( Galatians 6:7 ) . The curses pronounced on disobedience in Deut 28:47-53 were fulfilled in detail in Samaria ( 2 Kings 6:2 & 29 ) and in Judea ( AD 70 ) . The wrath of God upon covenant breakers is real . The `` I '' of the Psalms is Jesus Christ . The `` we '' of the Psalms includes those of us in the Lord Jesus . The enemies are not our own , individually , but those of the Lord and of His Church . The Psalms are ot Christ as Prophet , Priest , and King . They record Christ 's march in victory against the kingdom of darkness . As Christ is the author of the Psalms , so , too , is He the final fulfilment of the covenant on which they are based . God will answer the psalmist 's prayers completely in Jesus Christ on the final day of judgment . While on earth Jesus foretold the day when He will say : `` But those enemies of Mine who did not want Me to be King over them - bring them here and kill them in front of Me '' Luke 19:27 . A fatal end awaits everyone who refuses to acknowledge and to obey Jesus as King and Lord . Hearing expositions of these war psalms of the Prince of Peace will remind His people that God's kingdom is at war ! The kingdom of darkness is being overcome by the kingdom of Jesus Christ , a war in which each local congregation of believers plays a vital part . You must rally your battalion to put on the whole armour of God , including `` the sword of the Spirit , which is the Word of God `` Eph 6:17 . That battle- readiness also involves `` pray ( ing ) in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests n Eph 6:18 . Christ teaches His army to pray for the utter destruction of the enemies of God as the psalmist did : `` Pour out Your wrath on the nations that do not acknowledge You , on the kingdoms that do not call on Your Name '' Ps 79:6 . To deal with the very real hurts and injustices in this world it is necessary for us to pray for God 's justice . Those who are persecuted need the comfort of these prayers . `` Let the saints rejoice in His honour and sing for joy ... May the praise of God be in their mouths and a double-edged sword in their hands , to inflict vengeance on the nations and punishment on the peoples , to bind their kings with fetters , their nobles with shackles of iron , to carry out the sentences written against them . This is the glory of all His saints . Praise the Lord. `` Ps 149:5-9 Prayer is , in fact , spiritual warfare . One weapon is prayer for conversion of spiritual enemies ; another is prayer for judgement on those who finally refuse to be converted . We handicap the army of God when we refuse to use both of these great weapons that He has given us . It is at all times a part of the task of the people nf God to destroy evil . If you have been guilty of dulling your sword , by neglecting or undermining these psalms , repent of that sin , sharpen your sword anew , and go forth to do battle in the Name and for the Glory of Jesus - until `` the knowledge of the Lord will cover the earth as the waters cover the sea '' Hab 2:14 .

I am stating that a person who shows a continually biased opinion is close-minded and that his opinion should be ignored . Clayton is stating that a group of at least two million ( 1 % ) American citizens are evil vicious malicious child-molesters . Here 's a hypothetical question ... If Clayton said something like `` all those niggers are really stupid . '' ( Please do n't be offended , I 'm not racist but merely using an example of Clayton 's malign logic ) . And then said he read a report that a lot of blacks in inner cities dropped out of school , I bet he would n't have your support . Yet he can claim that all homosexuals are dishonest , evil , lying child molesters without *PERSONALLY* having a single homosexual friend or acquaintance and you 'll sit there and support him . God created a place for bigots . It 's called Hell and Clayton is going to burn there for a long time . I pray for him to find in his heart the Christian values he espouses so that he can learn to love his gay brothers and sisters , because anyone with so much hatred in his soul coulld never be righteous .

Year G AB BA OBP SLG HR SB CS 1987 21 83 .265 .271 .386 2 4 2 1988 146 563 .259 .317 .439 19 19 10 < -- 3rd Base Expt . year 1989 75 260 .177 .237 .335 9 9 6 1990 152 575 .303 .357 .539 32 33 16 1991 154 561 .251 .338 .496 32 34 15 1992 153 544 .259 .321 .415 17 32 10 In the majors for parts of 6 seasons , total playing time approx 4.5 seasons . Just looking at his hitting record , he 's had 2 seasons of OPS greater than .800 , which is pretty good for an OF . His 1988 season is pretty decent for a rookie 2B . The move to third base explains a lot of his 1989 . When he returned as an OF , he began hitting again . And of course , last year he slumped . But no learning curve ? He has obviously improved his batting eye over the years , as well as his SB/CS ratio . As to his fielding , he was an infielder when he was drafted , a 2Bman as he came up through the Braves system , and then the Braves put him through 2 position changes in the space of a year . He 's an adequate OF , although not great , and at least some of your perception of his fielding is colored by watching him learn to play the OF at the ML level . ( I know you 're another long-term Braves fan : ) About playing 3B ... IMO , that 's the 2nd most DIFFICULT position to field , after catcher . At SS or 2B , you need more range and speed , but at 3B , you 've got to have quick reflexes and have a GUN for an arm . There are NO second chances at 3B , even when playing sandlot softball ! Granted , I 'd still put my best overall infielder at SS , but that 's because he gets more chances , not because the job is harder . It still amazes me that so many teams have tried to convert other position players to 3B . But maybe that 's because the supply of `` natural '' 3B is scarce . Finally , Gant is a player who puts pressure on himself to perform well , and works hard to improve . You do n't get those amazingly huge arms on that relatively small body without a lot of weight work . Now , whether he 's been overdoing it these days may be a valid question , as is the question of whether he tries too hard to make something happen during each at-bat . But frankly , if a player is going to not live up to potential , I 'd much rather they fail by trying too hard , than by not trying hard enough . You might be able to teach relaxation to an adult ; but at that age I do n't believe you can teach hustle . All that said , I do n't think I 'd sign Gant to another long-term contract . He 's 28 now , and I think he 's free-agent eligible in 2 years , when he 'll be 30 . Given his career curve and limitations , I would n't expect him to last much past 35 as a ML ballplayer . He might surprise me here , but Atlanta's got some talent on the farm , and I 'd rather take my chances down the road with Nieves et al . Eric

Pretend someone telling Plato that it is highly probable that people do not really have souls ; their minds and their consciousness are just something their brains make up , and their brains ( their body ) is actually ahead of their mind even in voluntarly actions .

This is a common misconception , shared my many manufacturers , programmers , and users alike . COM3 , for example , is simply the third equipped COMM port , not necessarily the one with I/O address 3E8 . The BIOS just searches sequentially through a set of potential COMM port addresses . The first equipped port it finds will become COM1 , etc . If you 're playing by the rules , you ca n't have a COM4 unless you have a COM3 equipped . The set of `` standard '' ( whatever that means ) port addresses merely reflects the order in which the BIOS searches the I/O address space in its search for serial ports . So , what you have is indeed COM3 at the non-standard address 2E8 . Were this address in the 4th table slot instead , programs which query the BIOS to determine the number of installed COMM ports would not find it , as the field in the BIOS data area which contains this number would indicate that there are but 3 COMM ports installed .

The algorithm is classified . I speculate , from the MykoTronx data sheet on the MYK-78 , that the algorithm is a classified cryptosystem , similar in application to DES but cleared by the NSA for classified traffic , that has been in use for a number of years . Myktotronx refers to it as `` Government Type II encryption '' , which matches the designation of one of the types of encryption available on STU-III phones , and may be the same as a cryptosystem I have heard called `` CIPHER2 '' . This would make sense , since this is evidently a field-proven cryptosystem which can act as a `` pin-compatible '' substitute for DES . Combined with a tappable key exchange protocol , this would offer exactly what is claimed for Clipper : secure encryption with access via a key escrow . If this is fact the case , it would make me quite confident of the encipherment algorithm itself . Now , I do not know if these are in fact the same cryptosystem ; my knowledge of classified cryptography is n't even fuzzy : ) , it 's nonexistent . However , it would certainly have been the least-effort approach on the part of the government : take an old military cipher that people can drop in place of DES ( and which is at least as secure ) , set up a key escrow scheme for law enforcement , and promote it for public use . This also fits with Mykotronx , who 's been around but almost invisible for years . Has anyone else made this sort of connection , or am I just hallucinating pink elephants here ? : ) .

One very interesting thing I notice about this is that the only use of the chip key is to encode the session key for the law enforcement field . It is not used at all by the encryption algorithm . It seems like it would be possible to create a device that would be otherwise compatible , but would send out a bogus law enforcement field . This might render the device unusable with `` normal '' devices if there's some sort of validation involving the law enforcement field , but it could certainly be used with other such modified devices . Of course , this is irrelevant if the NSA has a backdoor in the algorithm , but it does make it possible to defeat the key escrow system . -- Wilt thou seal up avenues of ill ?

This would make > sense : Christ died , and his Mother , who waited at the foot of the > cross , would want to share in his death . The above article is a good short summary of traditional Christian teaching concerning the death of Mary . Also very good is `` Re : Question about the Virgin Mary '' by Micheal D. Walker . He tells the story very well . I would like to add that in the Eastern Orthodox Church we celebrate `` The Dormition ( or falling asleep ) of the Theotokos ( the mother of God ) '' . The Icon for this day shows Mary lying on a bed surrounded by the Apostles who are weeping . Christ , in his resurrected glory , is there holding what seems to be a small child . This is , in fact , Mary 's soul already with Christ in Heaven . The Assumption of Mary is one more confirmation for us as Christians that Christ did indeed conquer death . It forshadows the general resurrection on the last day . The disciples were not surprised to find Mary 's body missing from the grave . She was the Mother of the Savior . She was the first of all Christians . She gave birth to the Word of God . If it were not for her we would not be saved . This is why we pray in the Orthodox Church , `` Through the prayers of the Theotokos , Savior save us . '' Timothy Richardson rich0043 @ student.tc.umn.edu

The green layer is a solder-mask , and is used to make a finished board look neat , and to avoid solder bridges , especially when using wave soldering ( or any other mechanized approach ) . I 've seen red mask , but most that I 've seen are green . A bakelite board will look brown in colour , and , if the solder mask is put on , looks like a brown board with green 'paint ' on either side ( or just one side ) of the board . A fibreglass board will look green from the side , because the green solder-mask makes the board appear that colour . If you got a fibreglass board with no mask , it would be a whitish-grey colour . Teflon boards do exist , as well ... but I 'm not sure about that one . I 'd guess the stuff they invented for solder mask was green , so they're not about to change . Also , any change in any chemical probably requires a better than normal cleaning of the machines that make boards . A lot of companies do not make their own boards ... they ship them to a real boardhouse .

Feel free to provide a 1790s-era reference showing a usage other than '' individual right , not to be interfered with by govt '' .

The Duo 's memory is faster than its equivalent desktop machine by 5-10 % ( and the rest of the powerboks ) . I think the explanation for this was that it can refresh faster ( in 2 instead of 5 cycles I believe ) . Things that could affect performance would be factors such as use of functions enhanced in the FPU ( which the Duo does n't have undocked ) . Extensions and background applications can slow your computer down too . Real life differences in speed are likely to be influence by the software you are running , what kind of screen depth you are running etc . Espen PS ! The Duo is 32-bit through-out .

I pity those who hope that medical knowledge can resolve issues such as this . This issue has been rehashed in sci.med time and time again . The bottom line is this : in normal circumstances , both the medical advantages of and the medical risks of circumcision are minor . This means that the decision is left to the religious , cultural , ethical , and aesthetic mores of the parents , at best , or to the habit of the concerned hospital or caregivers , at worst . As ( prospective ) parents , you should do what you want in this regard and not worry about it too much . In terms of decisions you make for your child , it will have far less importance than many -- such as which schools you choose -- that most parents think about only a little . This question will undoubtedly push the buttons of people who feel that the decision to circumcise your infant or not is a momentous medical decision . It is not . Russell

I know locally , for most of the winter the ground , and concrete floor , within sheds and garages ( unheated ) is signifacantly warmer than the average air temperature .

From : games @ max.u.washington.edu Subject : Words from the Chairman of Boeing on SSTO type stuff Article-I.D . : max.1993Apr27.124850.1 Distribution : world Lines : 57 NNTP-Posting-Host : max.u.washington.edu Yesterday , I went to the Boeing shareholders meeting . It was a bit shorter than I expected . Last year ( when the stock was first down ) , they made a big presentation on the 777 , and other programs . This year , it was much more bare-bones . In any case , I wanted to ask a question that the board of directors would hear , and so I got there early , and figured that If I did n't get to the mike , maybe they would read mine off of a card , and so I wrote it down , and handed it in . After the meeting started , Mr. Shrontz said that he would only answer written questions , in order to be fair to the people in the overflow room that only had monitors downstairs . Naturally , I was crushed . So , when question and answer time came , I was suprised to find my question being read and answered . Admittedly near the end of the ones that he took . Presumably getting there early , and getting the question in early made all the difference . So , on to the substance . The question was Is Boeing looking at anything BEYOND the high speed Civil Transport , such as a commercial space launch system , and if not , how will Boeing compete with the reusable single stage to orbit technology presently being developed by Mcdonnell Douglass ? Well , he read it without a hitch , and without editing , with impressed me , then he answered it very quickly treating it as a two part question , last part first . This is to the best of my recollection what he said . As far as single stage to orbit technology , we think that we have a better answer in a two stage approach , and we are talking to some of our customers about that . As far as commercialization , that is a long ways off . The High speed Civil Transport is about as far out as our commercial planning goes at this point . So , this tells me that Boeing still considers space to be a non-commercial arena , and for the most part this is true , however it also tells me that they consider there to be enough money in building space launchers for them to persue work on their own . Now , I do have a friend on the spacelifter program at boeing . Actually , this is a mis-nomer , as there is no spacelifter contract for the work that this guy is doing , however , he is doing work in preparation of a proposal for space lifter contracts . He wo n't tell me what he is doing , but maybe this is where the TSTO action is taking place at boeing . At the very minimum , the chairman of the board of boeing said that they have an approach in mind , and they are trying to do something with it . Anybody know anything further ? Is this really news ? Does this threaten further work on DC- ? ? John .

The reasons are pragmatic : even if > Bosnian Muslims are Croats and Serbs who converted to Islam under > Turkish rule centuries ago , none of the present generation has any > clue what was their ancestor 's actual nationality . In fact , although I am forced to disagree with you . First of all , one may have been born from a non-Turkish , non-Muslim parent outside the Turkish land , yet still can be a Turk , provided this person calls himself or herself a Turk . Because the designation of a Turk is not a genetic feature , not a racial or religious feature . It is a matter of identifying with the Turkish values . Secondly , the following observations by Westerners were written in French by Ahmet Cevat : '' If Turks had behaved like Christians to use force to convert to Islam the nations which they brought under their power , to which no one could have opposed , today there would be no Eastern problem . But Turks did not do so . They obeyed the word of the Koran to permit everybody `` to worship in their own way '' centuries before Frederick the Great pronounced his famous dictum . Thus , in an age when the Christian Europe itself shed Christian blood and when people in Europe enjoyed inflicting inhuman tortures upon those whose beliefs differed from theirs , the Ottoman Empire became the sole country where the inquisition did not exist , where deaths at the stake were unheard of and where accusations of witchcraft were not made . And the barbarian ( ! ) Turkey was the only country where the Jews persecuted and chased away everywhere by the Christians , could find asylum . These facts demonstrate that Muslim countries provided spiritually far better living conditions than Christian countries . `` [ 1 ] '' The Turks , who are a conquering nation , did not Turkify the nations that came under their rule ; instead , they respected their religions and traditions . It was a stroke of luck for Romania to live under Turkish rule instead of Russian or Austrian rule . Because otherwise there would not have been a Romanian nation today '' ( Popescu Ciocanel ) . `` Turks rule over people under their administration only externally , without interfering with their internal structures . On account of this , the autonomy of minorities in Turkey is better and more complete than any in the most advanced European countries . `` [ 2 ] '' ... human beings hate each other on account of religious differences . This flaw is older than Islam and Christianity . But there has never been any examples of this adjuration in Turkey because Turks never oppress anybody on account of his religion . If enmity on the basis of religion had been such a case of simple contempt among us too , or if it did not keep translating itself into action , many nations in our Europe would probably have considered themselves happy ! '' ( A. de Mortraye ) . [ 3 ] '' Turkey never became a scene for religious terror or for the cruelty of the inquisition . On the contrary , it served as an asylum for the unfortunate victims of Christian fanaticism . If you look into history , you will see that in the fifteenth century thousands of Jews who were expelled from Spain and Portugal found such a good asylum in Turkey that their descendants have been living there very calmly all through these approximately three hundred years , and are only forced to defend themselves in some countries against the cruelty of Christians , especially that of the Orthodoxes . No Jew is able to appear in public during Easter celebrations in Athens , even today . In Turkey , however , if the Israelites are insulted by the Greek and Armenian communities , local courts immediately take them under their protection . '' `` In that vast and calm country of the sultan , all religions and nations are living together peacefully . Although the mosque is superior to the church and the synagogue , it does not replace them . Because of this , the Catholic sect is more free in Istanbul and Smyrna compared with Paris and Lyon . In addition to the fact that no law in Turkey prohibits the open-air ceremonies of this sect , neither does any law imprison its cross in the church . While the dead are being taken to the graves , a long line of priests bear processional candles and chant Catholic hymns .

The point that I 'll try to make is that coincidences like this occur with a very high frequency . How many of us have been thinking of someone and had that person call ? Much of the whole psychic phenomenon is easily explicable by this - one forgets the misses . Consider your astrological forcast in the newspaper .

Not entirely true . A friend of mine was having trouble finishing the game GODS and asked me for help since he could not find a `` trainer '' ( small patch that lets you play without losing lifes ) . The game is compressed but I did find *one* byte which when changed in the original *compressed* file would not affect the decompression and would also prevent the `` shield '' in the game from being tured off turning therefore making you invincible . There are many other progs whose copy protection was defeated one way or another and I have seen examples of this with my own eyes . The copy protection schemes defeated were various such as using protected mode , compressed executables , progs that load and execute other progs ( possibly compressed ) , dongles , key disks , etc ... I believe that persistence overcomes even the very best copy protection schemes . > -- > Michael Chen | From the depths of our most lucid horrors | > | spring our fond hopes and pure desires ... | > mchen @ cs.psu.edu | except what comes from HELL ! : - ) 7/23/92 | -- Alex T.

If you do n't do this , the > cursor will be hard to track when in motion . You allways could port and use emu from export.lcs.mit.edu : contrib/emu.tar.Z . We 've implemented a blinking text cursor for the very reasons people mentioned . You can even configure the actual size of the text cursor ( horizontal / ver- tical line cursors , smaller block cursors ) , turn on and off blinking , set the blink rate and so on . You even get blinking text - ok , enough advertising . I have n't looked at the xterm code in this respect , but from the memories I have when we had to decide whether to start with xterm and make it do what we wanted ( mostly the blinking text ) , I 'd say it wo n't be easy , since xterm is a hairy mess ( understandable if you follow it 's roots back to X10 ) . The actual task to get the cursor to blink is n't that difficult if you provide the right hooks . As Antonio mentioned , you 'll have to show the cursor directly after it has moved , or people will become confused . Since it 's a good idea to take the cursor off the screen when you do anything on screen anyways , this is n't very complicated . You 'll just have to start the blink process with the cursor showing directly after it 's mapped . As for the portability of emu and it 's newest version . The one on export is still the same as on the R5 contrib tape . We wanted to get out a new release for over six months now , but unfortunately we 're drowning in work . But since the changes are n't affectiong emu 's behavior much , I 'd say whoever wants to try emu should n't wait for a new version . As is , emu wo n't work on BSD derived systems ( e.g . SUNs ) with anything else than a csh . There is a fix to this , which is very short ( remove one line of code ) . I 'll put this on export today .

No . The library at Alexandria was perhaps the greatest library ever built in the world . The Greeks had a love of wisdom , philo sophos , and this great love was reflected in the Alexandrian library . The Christians got a hold of it and began modifying and purging texts and then the Moslems invaded and either the Christians burned the library to keep it from falling into Moslems hands ( far more likely since they were the book burners , not the Moslems ) , or it burned in the sack of the city or the Moslems burned it . Either way , a tremendous amount of information was lost .

A secret algorithm can still be secure , after all , we just do n't know it . Only our level of trust is affected , not the security of the system . The algorithm *could* be RSA for all we know , which we believe to be secure . They have a much better reason to classify the algorithm than to protect its security . They want to protect its market share . If they publish the algorithm , then shortly manufacturers would make chips that implement the algorithm and standard but do not use a key stored in escrow . And of course , everybody would buy them . The whole push of this chip is that by establishing a standard that you can only use if you follow their rules , they get us to follow their rules without enacting new laws that we would fight tooth and nail . Quite simply , with Clipper established , it would be much harder for another encryption maker to define a new standard , to make phones that ca n't talk to the leading phone companies . The result is tappable cryptography without laws forbidding other kinds , for 99 % of the populace . To get untappable crypto , you would have to build a special phone that runs on top of this system , and everybody you talk to would have to have an indentical one . That 's the chicken and egg of crypto . The government is using its very special ability to solve chicken and egg problems of new technologies to control this one in a way they like . It 's almost admirably clever . When the EFF started , I posed the question here '' What are the police going to do when they wake up and discover they ca n't wiretap ? '' and nobody here had an answer ( or even thought it was much of a question ) Then came the backdoor and Digital Telephony bills , which we fought .

The problem is that lead-acid cells self discharge over time . Even high quality cells ( Gates for instance ) will discharge 50-60 % over a 3-5 month period of time . Non-sealed cells self discharge even faster . If the battery was not completly charged when left sitting , it probably discharged past the the point where cell sulfiding occurs , which in many cases means a ruined battery . -- /|_|\ Datalog Consulting , Tucson , AZ ( . . ) ejm @ datalog.com \ / ... ! noao ! datalog.com ! ejm \_/

It took 7 years to build Keck I and now they are building Keck II . According to the December 1992 Sky & Telescope , `` This second 10-meter eye will convert the facility into a binocular telescope with double the light-gathering power and the ability to resolve the headlights of a car some 25,000 kilometers away . '' Japan 's 8.3-meter Subaru telescope will soon join Keck on Mauna Kea . All these telescopes will work in the infrared , yes , but they are _visible light_ telescopes ! And have n't you heard anything about adaptive optics ? A lot of research was done with `` Star Wars '' funding , and some is now being shared with astronomers . This shows great promise . Soon , probably within a few years , even the largest telescopes will be able to resolve to their theoretical limit _despite_ the distortions of the atmosphere . To say that `` visible light astronomy is already a dying field '' is pure hokum . To use the `` logic '' that things are already bad , so it doesn't matter if it gets worse is absurd . Maybe common sense and logic are the dying fields .

Omidvar Minsoo Suk Series Editor Volume Editor Significant progress has been made recently in shape analysis using neural networks and the energy minimization concept . Ablex Publishing Corporation is planning a special volume on `` Shape Analysis '' , scheduled for this year . This volume will be a part of `` Progress in Neural Networks , '' an annual book series reviewing research in modelling , analysis , design and application of neural networks . The primary aim of this volume is to present , in a single volume , the most important achievements made on this important topic , which are otherwise scattered in diverse literature . Authors are invited to submit original manuscripts detailing recent progress . Suggested topics include , but are not limited to : shape modelling , shape estimation , shape recovery , shape representation , shape matching , surface reconstruction and surface decomposition . Research work utilizing neural networks directly or based on energy minimization techniques such as Markov random field , mean field annealing , simulated annealing , graduated non-convexity algorithms and resistive networks are most welcome . The paper should be tutorial in nature , self contained and preferably , but not necessarily , about fifty double spaced pages in length . Please send electronically ( if you prefer , you can send a hardcopy to the address below ) an abstract and an outline to msuk @ ima.enst.fr by May 30 , 1993 .

There are two approaches : 1 . If your power cord is the kind that detaches from the back of the monitor ( most common ) you can get a *replacement* power cord that will go from the monitor to the back of the computer . 2 . You can get an adpater that connects to the plug end of the existing power cord and provides the proper end that plugs into the back of the computer . Both cost about the same ( aprox . $ 5 ) and are available from many computer stores ( clone dealers are usually better at having these things and at good prices ) . Power cords are standard , so you do n't have to go looking for some special thing at a Mac store .

Yeah , Mario is good at drawing penalties , but would n't you try do something ( you do claim to play ) to give your team an advantage ? I do n't remember Lemieux getting any diving penalties this year , whereas many others did . Finally , Mario has NEVER complained about being hit . He knows it 's part of the game ; he gets back by dishing out an even bigger hit to the same guy or just scoring a few goals ( or setting them up . ) Do n't you have any compassion for a man who has gone through so much in his life ?

Some thoughts and facts , 1 . ) Bill James is a partial owner of STATS , inc . However he has almost nothing to do with the day-to-day operations of the company , although he does have significant input into the design of the books that bear his name . ( The handbook , but not the scoreboard ) . To the best of my knowledge , the only things that Bill actually writes for STATS are the predictions section of the handbook , and the Bill James Fantasy Baseball rulebook . 2 . ) The debate over Elias goes way back . Bill James ' early stuff was hampered by the fact that Elias would not give access to their stats at any price . Project Scoresheet , and later , STATS were founded to fill this void . You can call STATS , and ask them for a report on just about anything in their database , and they will provide it -- for a price , of course . Or you could just log into their online system and look at the data yourself . Having attempted to pry numbers from Elias in the past ( football , not baseball ) , they just do n't do that . In STATS eyes , the high ground comes from making the information available at all . 3 . ) That being said , I 'm pretty dissapointed by Bill 's book this year , too . I am given to understant that it was mostly a response to the publishers desire to have the book come out sooner than April . Hope this makes things just a little bit clearer . ( Bias alert . I am a former part-time employee of STATS . ) Noel Rappin noel @ chaos.cs.brandeis.edu

It would be nice to know that they were not a front company used by an intelligence or other agency of the U.S. government . Trusting the fox to guard the chickens , and all that . Seems suspicious when the rest of the sources are foxes . While we are at it , the chip design ( s ) should be examined and verified against silicon to insure no trap doors or hidden protocols exist in silicon , regardless of the security level of the encryption algorithm . It would be a shame if some three letter agency had the ability to interrogate my chip , when all I 'd know is that someone rang , and when I attempted to go off hook the line went dead . Could be even worse if the chip were intended to connect directly to a modem . The design examination should be done to the gate level . Does anyone have a good idea how to tell if there is a piggyback design on silicon ? The model would be extra logic sharing pins with the advertised function . Tip offs would be circuitry that would ignore incoming data if formats or sequence is not right . I can think of only two ways an output pin could be used , and its possible that might be noticed , but could be edited from the netlist . I think the silicon itself needs to be investigated . Imagine a design done in two layer metalization , yet finding a third layer under the microscope . The government is asking for a lot of blind trust : the encryption algorithm , operating protocols , the agency having physical control of the devices , the silicon implementation . I 'd feel like keeping one hand on my wallet .

Okay , it looks like I am going to have to do the history lesson after all . During the Vietnam war , there were a great many citizens opposed to it who considered themselves perfectly law abiding , although Mr. Nixon and his lackeys thought otherwise . The Federal government had no compunction about adding `` people who are otherwise decent , law abiding and upstanding , but disagree with us '' to your nice little list .

You see that this individual has a submachinegun , and that more similarly armed individuals are rushing your front door .

You have chosen a ) , and discover that the people you defended yourself against are federal agents , who now are camped outside your door waiting for you to surrender . You have learned that they intend to charge you with murder , and are further defaming your name , while claiming that you can safely surrender at any time . Then they start using psychological warfare techniques against you , while still claiming that you can safely give up and will receive a fair trial . Some weeks into this standoff , you are still holding out , when they begin a new ploy to induce your surrender , namely using tear gas to annoy you , and ramming your home with tanks . Yet they claim that you can safely surrender at any time . While you patiently wait out this latest round of attacks , your house catches fire and the bales of hay you were using as cover spread the fire rapidly through the house , and you try to escape through the fortifications you had raised for your own defense and the rubble created by the tanks . Only 9 of your followers make it . I am not claiming that the above scenario is accurate . I am disagreeing with the notion that it is their own fault for dying because they refused to surrender to agents of the Federal government after another federal agency committed an armed assault of their home on the basis of a flimsily concocted search warrant . Look at how the Texas Rangers view the BATF . Look at the FBI statements regarding the BATF actions . From all apparent sources , the FBI blundered trying to clean up the mess made by the BATF , resulting in an accidental fire which killed most of the BD 's who were still in the compound , and are now playing CYA . The BATF committed an illegal assault , obtained the use of Texas NG resources with fabricated allegations , and compounded their abuses by accusing the BD 's of crimes outside their jurisdiction once they had been held off in their assault . -- ******************************************************************************** James S.

During a minor leaque game a player neck was cut when the opponent he was back-checking tripped and his skakes flew up .

And just for my own curiosity I thought I 'd look up the `` official '' definition of large in the dictionary . It reads : large - 1. having more than usual power , capacity , or scope . 2. exceeding most other things of like kind in quantity or size . Now I have no idea how many letters Bettman may have gotten on the issue or how many people may have signed them . 65 people may be up there , thereby validating definition 2 . I would also wager that the geographical range of signatures is quite large , which would give it a large scope . > He might be impressed by the size of the list of names .

From : jrm @ gnv.ifas.ufl.edu Subject : BATF & FBI Do Right Thing in Waco Lines : 44 Everyone is complaining about the debacle in Waco . It is hard to understand all this angst . What happend there is nothing less than what we wanted to happen . Why all the sour grapes ? BATF was looking for a propaganda event to counteract their impending budget cuts ... the attendance of the press at the initial big commando raid is proof . It would have been ever so easier to grab Koresh and his central followers as they shopped in Waco . Alas , no propaganda value there . The FBI screwed-up big time , all the time . They should have never allowed the situation to drag out like that . A quick second assault , before the BDs could decide on a strategy , would have been the better plan . The BDs themselves were the biggest screw-ups though . They imagined that US law and US law-enforcement had no jurisdiction within their little 'country ' . WRONG ! They had no right whatsoever to fire on the BATF , and if they mistook their identity initially , they should have surrendered at once when they did realize who they were . If the BDs had a problem with the warrants , they take it to court , just like the rest of us . If they wanted full-auto weapons , they could have obtained the proper permits , just like the rest of us would need to do . What they may NOT do is decide for themselves what US law applies to themselves and which does not . They get their chance like the rest of us - at the voting booth . If the BATF and FBI have become latter-day Gestapo , then they have become that way because WE have desired them to be so . We get to vote on laws , and on the lawmakers . By our choices over the years , we have approved the creation and form of the BATF and FBI . When the FBI was out chasing 'pinkos ' , the general public did n't seem to mind a bit of extra-constitutional activity . When the BATF is raiding militant black organizations , we do n't mind the heavy hand . When the FBI is dicking around with the rights of potheads , the public does n't mind . Suddenly , when we see a bit of ourselves in the current 'enemy ' choosen by these agencies , we get all bent out of shape . SUPRISE ! You reap what you sow . Waco was an encapsulation of the All-American experience - religious fanaticism , militaristic thinking and overwhelming violence . Don't blame it on 'them ' , the FBI and BATF . They were just acting within the parameters we have set over the years . We made 'them ' . We ARE 'them ' . -- Jim Mason

From : pstlb @ aurora.alaska.edu Subject : Where did the hacker ethic go ? Lines : 46 Nntp-Posting-Host : acad3.alaska.edu Organization : University of Alaska Fairbanks A great many computer programmers read `` Dr. Dobb 's Journal '' . In a recent issue , there was a paragraph in an article that pained me greatly to read . It said : `` There 's nothing wrong if Microsoft setting the standards for the computer industry . The industry NEEDS an IBM for the 90 's . '' Where has the hacker ethic gone ? Not the `` cracker '' ethic , which is something entirely different and bad , but the hacker ethic , which tells us to value the free distribution of information and yield to the hands-on imperative ? Why is it that people and corporations like Bill Gates , IBM , and Intel are able to have a virtual dead lock on the computer industry ? Why is it that , if a person like myself posts messages to Usenet on how to get into the little nooks , crannies , and idiosyncrasies of a computer system , they are not given any useful information by those who know , just a badmouthing ? ( or are completely ignored ) Why is it that people like Steve Jobs have to abandon their efforts to make truly innovative products ? I ask those of you who call yourselves hackers , why is this ? And further , how can you let it go on ? It is a fact that the computer industry has changed the world , and shall continue to do so for a long time to come . It has allowed the propagation of information in a volume unheard of even twenty years ago , and has made this world even smaller than it was before . I shudder to think what that world will be like if the corporations are allowed to have their way , perpetuating more drivel like the 286 , Windows , and the IBM product line on the computer-using public . That is not to say I am against business per se ; people who profit off of innovative , intelligent , creative designs do not bother me . In fact , I applaud it ; that is the American way . But those who manage to sell kludgy , uncreative systems to the public , and profit off of them , are the ones who are the problem . And , unfortunately , because they have enough money to make up for blunt stupidity , they can keep doing it for a very long time . I put it to you thus : Where HAS the hacker ethic gone ? If it still exists , where ? And , if it DOES exist , why are those who call themselves `` hackers '' allowing this to perpetuate itself ? Why are they not creating new , innovative , interesting ideas to stop the SOS from maintaining its choke hold on the computer industry ? I await with interest what will probably be a resounding silence . + -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- + | pstlb @ acad3.alaska.edu | `` Revenge is a dish best served cold .

Unfortunally , people strongly disagree which mode will lead to destruction of all of the following data . Sure seems that some modes will resync quite fast , others will never , others will even only effect the very block . Summarized , people said concerning *this* matter : / |In CBC mode , only the current block will be affected ( tarnold @ vnet.IBM.COM | < Todd W.

For a single 64-bit input block , a one-bit error will have a 50 percent chance of corrupting each of the 64 output bits - in other words , it essentially turns the output block into a random number . If you 're encrypting data in CBC mode , however , only the one 64-bit block will be affected . The next block , and all that follow it will be decrypted properly . It 's a good idea to have some kind of error correction in your system if corrupted bits are likely . - Todd -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- From : pausch @ saaf.se ( Paul Schlyter ) In article < ad.735831059 @ cat > you write : > Hello , > > how sensible is DES encrypted data towards bit errors ?

How much data per bit will be lost in average ( I assume you still have the correct key ) ? It depends on the mode you 're using DES in . Electronic Code Book ( ECB ) takes a block of 64 input bits and produces 64 output bits , so if any bits are changed , the entire block of 64 bits becomes bad . I forget which feedback mode is which . In all of them , the results of encrypting one block affect later blocks . With some modes , the system self-synchronizes , so errors are repaired in a few blocks . With other modes , once one block is bad , all later blocks will be bad too . There 's also the framing problem . If you have a bit change , the block that it 's in changes , and maybe later blocks also change .

[ other examples ] > What all of these `` deathbed conversion '' > claims have in common is that they are utterly unsubstantiated , and > almost certainly untrue . I would not be too quick to say that they are almost certainly untrue . Even strong minded people may fall back on childhood indoctrination , grasp at straws , or do other strange things when faced with extreme suffering , not to mention physiological problems which may lead to diminished mental capacity . At the risk of restarting an old argument and accusations of appeal to authority I remind readers of what I posted a while back as a kind of obituary for the late atheist Dr. Albert Sabin . In an old interview rebroadcast on public radio just after his death he told about a time a few years before when he was stricken with a very serious illness . He admitted to having cried out to God while critically ill and on a respirator . As it turned out he recovered and lived several more years . After his recovery he attributed this to early indoctrination . Do n't say it could n't happen to you , or that it has n't happened to others , even if you are one of the few people who have experienced things like this . People are different . I admire Dr. Sabin for admitting his human weakness in that instance . I would not think less of Asimov for similar weakness . Nevertheless I agree that these reports are unsubstantiated and may well be untrue . In any case they are not evidence for anything besides the power of early indoctrination and human frailty .

However Jesus was referring to John the > Baptist not in the sense that Elijah was reincarnated as John > ( remember Elijah didn ` t die ) but that John was a similar prophet to > Elijah . > There is no question of similarity in Jesus indication about John . The passage in Matthew is very direct . Where Luke ( 1:17 ) reports the angel Gabriel prophesying that John will go before Christ `` in the power and spirit of Elias '' , In Matthew 11 : 14 , Jesus himself says of John , `` And if you care to accept it , he himself is Elijah , who was to come '' . It is interesting that Jesus prepended the words , `` If you care to accept it '' , as if to say that the implications of this truth , namely of rein- carnation , I will not force on you , but for those who can accept it , here it is . A Jewish poster to other newsgroups on Jewish esotericism and other topics has outlined the esoteric , cabbalistic Jewish teaching of of reincarnation and Karma , a teaching that is little known among Jews today , but which is apparently widespread enough in Israel that Hannah Hurnard ( `` Hinds Feet on High Places '' ) was told about it by a Rabbi she was trying to convert back in the 1940s as a missionary in Palestine . Thus there may well have been a small number of Jews who knew about this , whereas the large number of people did not . The statement of Jesus about John , the greatest human personality in the New Testament , is guarded but nevertheless quite direct . Again , the subject of reincarnation , one way or another , is not a subject of the New Testament , nor is the fate in general of the human being between death and the last judgement . But there are occasional indications that point to it . As for the `` popular belief '' that Elijah would come again , it was more than a popular belief , as Jesus confirms it in more than one place , and he never corrected those who were expecting Elijah -- for example , those who thought that Jesus himself be he .

It is a belief based on faith , which by definition is not necessarily backed up by logic . Faith is a given . God is a absolute truth when arguing from religion . Also , many religions would reject your thesis that their beliefs simply come from these day-to-day principles . In summation , if you wish to use religious arguments be prepared to back them up with `` It says in the [ fill in religious document here ] , '' because most religions ( things which at least I denote as religions ) are based on the writings of or teachings of [ fill in religious figure here ] . NOTE : Religion is a charged topic and if I offended anyone regarding my references to God , I apologize . Please insert your own sensible references , the argument should apply to nearly all religions . -- ============================================================================== Kristofer ( kmunn @ tudor.com ) - The opinions expressed within are solely those -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - of the author and are subject to change when confronted with new information and logical , coherent arguments .

Typical 'virvir ' drivel . People will think you 're just some looney howling in the wires . If you think that this 'clears things up ' for me or anyone else , you must also believe that aliens from outer space come to earth regularly and abduct 'Arromdians ' of ASALA/SDPA/ARF for medical experiments . There is stronger evidence for *that* you know . 'Propagandist leaflets ' ?

Source : `` World Alive , A Personal Story '' by Robert Dunn . Crown Publishers , Inc. , New York ( 1952 ) . ( Memoirs of an American officer who witnessed the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people ) p. 361 ( seventh paragraph ) and p. 362 ( first paragraph ) . 'The most are inside houses . Come you and look . ' 'No , dammit ! My stomach isn't-' 'One is a Turkish officer in uniform . Him you must see . ' `` We were under those trees by the mosque , in an open space ... . ' I do n't believe you , '' I said , but followed to a nail-studded door . The man pushed it ajar , then spurred away , leaving me to check on the corpse . I thought I should , this charge was so constant , so gritted my teeth and went inside . The place was cool but reeked of sodden ashes , and was dark at first , for its stone walls had only window slits . Rags strewed the mud floor around an iron tripod over embers that vented their smoke through roof beams black with soot . All looked bare and empty , but in an inner room flies buzzed . As the door swung shut behind me I saw they came from a man 's body lying face up , naked but for its grimy turban . He was about fifty years old by what was left of his face - a rifle butt had bashed an eye . The one left slanted , as with Tartars rather than with Turks . Any uniform once on him was gone , so I 'd no proof which he was , and quickly went out , gagging at the mess of his slashed genitals . '' p. 363 ( first paragraph ) . 'How many people lived there ? ' 'Oh , about eight hundred . ' He yawned . 'Did you see any Turk officers ? ' 'No , sir . I was in at dawn . All were Tartar civilians in mufti . ' `` The lieutenant dozed off , then I , but in the small hours a voice woke me - Dro 's . He stood in the starlight bawling out an officer . Anyone keelhauled so long and furiously I 'd never heard . Then abruptly Dro broke into laughter , quick and simple as child 's . Both were a cover for his sense of guilt , I thought , or hoped . For somehow , despite my boast of irreligion , Christian massacring 'infidels ' was more horrible than the reverse would have been . From daybreak on , Armenian villagers poured in from miles around ... .. The women plundered happily , chattering like ravens as they picked over the carcass of Djul . They hauled out every hovel 's chattels , the last scrap of food or cloth , and staggered away , packing pots , saddlebags , looms , even spinning-wheels . 'Thank you for a lot , Dro , ' I said to him back in camp . 'But now I must leave . ' ... We shook hands , the captain said ' A bientot , mon camarade . ' And for hours the old Molokan scout and I plodded north across parching plains . Like Lot 's wife I looked back once to see smoke bathing all , doubtless in a sack of other Moslem villages up to the line of snow that was Iran . ' '' p. 354 . `` At morning tea , Dro and his officers spread out a map of this whole high region called the Karabakh . Deep in tactics , they spoke Russian , but I got their contempt for Allied 'neutral ' zones and their distrust of promises made by tribal chiefs . A campaign shaped ; more raids on Moslem villages . '' p. 358 . `` It will be three hours to take , '' Dro told me . We 'd close in on three sides . `` The men on foot will not shoot , but use only the bayonets , '' Merrimanov said , jabbing a rifle in dumbshow . `` That is for morale , '' Dro put in . `` We must keep the Moslems in terror . '' `` Soldiers or civilians ? '' I asked . `` There is no difference , '' said Dro . `` All are armed , in uniform or not . '' `` But the women and children ? '' `` Will fly with the others as best they may . '' p. 360 . `` The ridges circled a wide expanse , its floors still . Hundreds of feet down , the fog held , solid as cotton flock . 'Djul lies under that , ' said Dro , pointing . 'Our men also attack from the other sides . ' Then , 'Whee-ee ! ' - his whistle lined up all at the rock edge . Bayonets clicked upon carbines . Over plunged Archo , his black haunches rippling ; then followed the staff , the horde - nose to tail , bellies taking the spur . Armenia in action seemed more like a pageant than war , even though I heard our Utica brass roar . As I watched from the height , it took ages for Djul to show clear . A tsing of machine-gun fire took over from the thumping batteries ; cattle lowed , dogs barked , invisible , while I ate a hunk of cheese and drank from a snow puddle . Mist at last folded upward as men shouted , at first heard faintly . The came a shrill wailing . Now among the cloud-streaks rose darker wisps - smoke . Red glimmered about house walls of stone or wattle , into dry weeds on roofs . A mosque stood in clump of trees , thick and green . Through crooked alleys on fire , horsemen were galloping after figures both mounted and on foot . 'Tartarski ! ' shouted the gunner by me . Others pantomimed them in escape over the rocks , while one twisted a bronze shell-nose , loaded , and yanked breech-cord , firing again and again . Shots wasted , I thought , when by afternoon I looked in vain for fallen branch or body . But these shots and the white bursts of shrapnel in the gullies drowned the women 's cries . At length all shooting petered out . I got on my horse and rode down toward Djul . It burned still but little flame showed now . The way was steep and tough , through dense scrub . Finally on flatter ground I came out suddenly , through alders , on smoldering houses . Across trampled wheat my brothers-in- arms were leading off animals , several calves and a lamb . '' p. 361 ( fourth paragraph ) . `` Corpses came next , the first a pretty child with straight black hair , large eyes . She looked about twelve years old . She lay in some stubble where meal lay scattered from the sack she 'd been toting . The bayonet had gone through her back , I judged , for blood around was scant . Between the breasts one clot , too small for a bullet wound , crusted her homespun dress . The next was a boy of ten or less , in rawhide jacket and knee-pants . He lay face down in the path by several huts . One arm reached out to the pewter bowl he 'd carried , now upset upon its dough . Steel had jabbed just below his neck , into the spine . There were grownups , too , I saw as I led the sorrel around . Djul was empty of the living till I looked up to see beside me Dro 's German-speaking colonel . He said all Tartars who had not escaped were dead . '' p. 358 . `` ... more stories of Armenian murdering Turks when the czarist troops fled north . My hosts told me of their duty here : to keep tabs on brigands , Turkish troop shifts , hidden arms , spies - Christian , Red or Tartar - coming in from Transcaucasus . Then they spoke of the hell that would break loose if Versailles were to put , as threatened , the six 'Armenian' vilayets of Turkey under the control of Erevan ... An Armenia without Armenians ! Turks under Christian rule ? His lips smacked in irony under the droopy red moustache . That 's bloodshed - just Smyrna over again on a bigger scale .

From : banschbach @ vms.ocom.okstate.edu Subject : PMS-Can It Be Prevented By A Diet Change ? Lines : 274 Nntp-Posting-Host : vms.ocom.okstate.edu Organization : OSU College of Osteopathic Medicine This question came up in Sci . Med . Nutrition and I 'm posting my answer here . Only 22 medical schools in the U.S. teach courses on human nutrition . We have already seen what a lack of nutrition education can do when candida and kidney stones present themselves to the medical community . I think that the best example of where U.S. medicine is really missing the mark when it comes to a knowledge of nutrition is PMS . So many women ( and their husbands ) suffer from this disorder that it is really criminal that most physicians in the U.S. are not taught that PMS is primarily caused by diet and diet changes can prevent it from ever happpening . Before shooting your flames , read the entire article and then decide if flaming is justified . From A Poster In Sci . Medi . Nutrition : > In a psychological anthropology course I am taking , we got > sidetracked onto a short conversation about PMS . Some rumors shared > by several of the students included ideas that vitamin levels , sugar > intake , and caffeine intake might affect PMS symptoms . > Is there any data on this , or is it just so much hooey ? > > Many thanks , > > Michael , I 've wanted to reply to this post ever since I saw it but I got side-tracked with candida . PMS is a lot like Candida blooms , most physicians do n't recognize it as a specific `` disease '' entity . Here is everything that you would ever want to know about PMS . Premenstrual syndrome has been divided into four specific subgroups : PMT-A ( Anxiety ) PMT-D ( depression ) anxiety depression irritability forgetfulness insomnia confusion depression lethargy PMT-C ( Craving ) PMT-H ( Hyperhydration ) craving for sweets weight gain increased appetite breast congestion and tenderness sugar ingestion causes : abdominal bloating and tenderness 1. headache edema of the face and extremities 2. palpitations 3. fatigue or fainting PMT-A is characterized by elevated blood estrogen levels and low progesterone levels during the luteal phase of a women 's cycle . PMT-C is caused by the ingestion of large amounts of refined simple carbohydrates . During the luteal phase of a women 's cycle , there is increased glucose tolerance with a flat glucose curve after oral glucose challenge . The metabolic findings believed to be responsible for PMT-C are a low magnesium and a low prostaglandin E1 . This condition of hypoglycemia is not unique to PMS but there are a number of different causes of hypoglycemia , magnesium and PGE1 seem to be specific to PMS hypoglycemia . A . Am . J. Psychiatry 147 ( 4 ) :477-80 ( 1990 ) . Unrefined complex carbohydrate should be substituted for sugar , magnesium supplementation and alpha linoleic acid supplementation ( increased to 5-6 % of the total calories ) using safflower oil or evening primrose oil as sources of alpha linoleic acid . PMT-D is characterized by elevated progesterone levels during the midluteal phase of a women 's cycle . Another cause of PMT-D has been found to be lead toxicity ( in women without elevated progesterone levels during the midluteal phase ) . `` Effect of metal ions on the binding of estridol to human endometrial cystol '' Fertil . Steril . 28:312-18 ( 1972 ) . PMT-H is associated with water and salt retention along with an elevated serum aldosterone level . Salt restriction , B6 , magnesium and vitamin E for breast tenderness have all been effective in treating PMT-H This general discussion of the PMS syndromes came form : A . `` Management of the premenstrual tension sundromes : Rational for a nutritional approach '' . 1986 , A Year in Nutritional Medicine . J . Bland , Ed . Keats , Publishing , 1986 . B . `` Nutritional factors in the etiology of premenstrual tension syndromes '' , J. Reprod . Med.28 ( 7 ) :446-64 ( 1983 ) . C. `` Premenstrual tension '' , Prob . Obstet . Gynecol . 3 ( 12 ) :1-39 ( 1980 ) Treatment has traditionally involved progesterone administration if you can find a doctor who will treat you for PMS ( just about as hard as finding one that will treat you for candida blooms ) . While progesterone will work , supplementation with vitamins and minerals works even better . There really has been an awful lot of research done on PMS ( much more than candida blooms ) . Many of these studies have been what are called experimental controlled studies ( the type of rigorous clinical studies that doctors like to see done ) . Here are a few of these studies : CARBOHYDRATE : Experimental Controlled Study , `` Effect of a low-fat , high-carbohydrate diet on symptoms of cyclical mastopathy '' Lancet 2:128-32 ( 1988 ) . 21 pts with severe persistent cyclical mastopathy of at least 5 years duration were randomly selected to receive specific training to reduce dietary fat to 15 % of total calories and increase complex carbohydrate ingestion or given general dietary advise with no training . After 6 months , there was a significant reduction in the severity of the breast swelling and tenderness in the trained group as reported by self-reported symptoms as well as physical exams which quantitated the degree of breast swelling , tenderness and nodularity . VITAMIN A : Experimental Controlled Study , `` The use of Vitamin A in premenstrual tension '' Acta Obstet . Gynecol Scand . 39:586-92 ( 1960 ) . 218 pts with severe recurring PMS received 200,000 to 300,000IU vitamin A daily or a placebo . Serum retinol levels were monitored and high dose supplementation was discontinued when evidence of toxicity occured ( serum retinol above 450ug/ml ) . The intent of the study was to load the liver up with vitamin A and get a normal pool size ( 500,000IU to 1,000,000IU ) and then see if this normal vitamin A pool could prevent PMS . 48 % getting the high dose vitamin A had complete remission of the symptoms of PMS . Only 10 % getting the placebo reported getting complete relief of PMS sysmptoms . 10 % of the vitamin A treated group reported no improvement in PMS symptoms . Experimental Controlled Study , `` Premenstrual tension treated with vitamin A '' J . Clinical Endocrinology 10:1579-89 ( 1950 ) . 30 pts received 200,000IU of vitamin A daily starting on day 15 of their cycle with supplementation continuing until the onset of PMS symptoms . After 2-6 months , all 30 pts reported a significant improvement in PMS symptoms . Vitamin A supplementation was stopped once evidence of toxicity was demonstrated and all 30 pts were followed for one year after high dose vitamin A supplementation was stopped . PMS symptoms did not reoccur in any of these 30 pts for upto one year after the vitamin A supplementation was stopped . Most Americans do not have a normal store of vitamin A in their liver . These studies and several others were designed to see if getting a normal store of vitamin A into the liver could eliminate PMS . Of all the vitamins given for PMS ( vitamin A , B6 , and vitamin E ) , vitamin A has shown the best single effect . This is probably because vitamin A is involved in steroid ( estrogen/progesterone ) metabolism in the liver . Getting your liver full of vitamin A seems to be one of the best things that you can do to prevent the symptoms of PMS . But vitamin A is toxic and you do n't want to be trying to do this without being seen by a physician who can monitor you for vitamin A toxicity . VITAMIN B6 : Experimental Double-blind Crossoverr Study , `` Pyridoxine ( vitamin B6 ) and the premenstrual syndrome : A randomized crossover trial '' J.R. Coll . Gen. Pract . 39:364-68 ( 1989 ) . 32 women aged 18-49 with moderate to severe PMS randomly received 50mg B6 daily or placebo . After 3 months the groups were switched and followed for another 3 months . B6 had a significant effect on the emotional aspects of PMS ( depression , irritability and tiredness ) . Other symptoms of PMS were not significanttly affected by B6 supplementation . Experimental Double-blind Study , `` The efects of vitamin B6 supplementation on premenstrual sysmptoms '' Obstet . Gynecol 70 ( 2 ) :145-49 ( 1987 ) . 55 pts with moderate to severe PMS received 150mg B6 daily or placebo for 2 months . Analysis of convergence showed that B6 significantly improved premenstrual symptoms related to the autonomic nervous system ( dizziness and vomiting ) as well as behavior changes ( poor mental performance , decreased social interaction ) Anxiety , depression and water retention were not improved by B6 supplementation . Vitamin B6 is below the RDA for both American men and women . Birth control pills and over 40 different drugs increase the B6 requirement in man . Women on birth control pills should be supplemented with 10-15 mg of B6 per day . The dose should be increased if symptoms of PMS appear . Dr. David R. Rubinow who heads the biological psychiatry branch of NIMH was quoted in Clin . Psychiatry News , December , 1987 as stating that B6 should be considered the `` first-line '' drug for PMS ( over progesterone ) and if the patient does not respond , then other treatments should be tried . Vitamin B6 can be toxic ( nerve damage ) if consumed in doses of 500mg or more each day . VITAMIN E : Experimental Double-blind Study , `` Efficacy of alpha- tocopherol in the treatment of premenstrual syndrome '' J. Reprod . Med . 32 ( 6 ) :400-04 ( 1987 ) . 35 pts received 400IU vitamin E daily for 3 cycles or a placebo . Vitamin E treated pts had 33 % who reported a significant reduction in physical symptoms ( weight gain and breast tenderness ) while the placebo group had 14 % who reported a significant reduction in physical symptoms . The vitamin E group reported that 38 % had a significant reduction in anxiety versus 12 % for the placebo group . For depression , the vitamin E group had 27 % with a significant decrease in depression compared with 8 % for the placebo group . Experimental Double-blind Study , `` The effect of alpha-tocopherol on premenstrual symptomalogy : A double blind study '' J . Am . Coll . Nutr . 2 ( 2 ) :115-122 ( 1983 ) . 75pts with benign breast disease and PMT randomly received vitamin E at 75IU , 150IU , or 300IU daily or placebo . After 2 months of supplementation , 150IU of vitamin E or higher significantly improved PMT-A and PMT-C . The 300IU dose was needed to significantly improve PMT-D. No dose of vitamin E significantly improved PMT-H ( other studies have shown that a higher vitamin E doses will relieve PMT-H symptoms ) . MAGNESIUM : Experimental Double-blind Study , `` Magnesium prophylaxis of menstrual migraine : effects on itracellular magnesium '' Headache 31:298-304 ( 1991 ) . 20 pts with perimenstrual headache received 360 mg daily of magnesium as magnesium pyrrolidone carboxylic acid or a placebo . Treatment was started on the 15th day of the cycle and continued until menstruation . After 2 months , the Pain Total Index was significantly lower in the magnesium group . Magnesium treatment was also assocoiated with a significant reduction in the Menstrual Distress Questionnaire scores . Pretreatment magnesium levels in lymphocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes were significantly lower in this group of 20 pts compared to control women who did not suffer from PMS . After treatment , magnesium levels in these cells was raised into the normal range . Experimental Double-blind Study , `` Oral Magnesium successfully relieves premenstrual mood changes '' Obstet . Gynecol 78 ( 2 ) :177-81 ( 1991 ) . 32pts aged 24-39 randomly received either magnesium carboxylic acid 360mg of Mg per day or a placebo from the 15th day of the cycle to the onset of the menstrual flow . After 2 cycles , both groups received magnesium . The Menstrual Distress Questionnaire score of the cluster pain was significantly reduced during the second cycle ( month ) for the magnesium treatment group as well as the placebo group once they were switched to magnesium supplementation . In addition , the total score on the Menstrual Distress Questionnaire was significantly decreased by magnesium supplementation . The authors suggest that magnesium supplemenation should become a routine treatment for the mood changes that occur during PMS . There are numerous observational studies that have been published in the medical literature which also suggest that PMS is primarily a disorder that arises out of a hormone imbalance that is dietary in nature . But since observational studies are considered by most physicians in Sci . Med . to be anecdotal in nature , I have not bothered to cite them . There are also over a half dozen good experimental studies that have been done on multivitamin and mineral supplementation to prevent PMS . I 've chosen the best specific studies on individual vitamins and minerals to try to point out that PMS is primarily a nutritional disorder . But doctors do n't recognize nutritional disorders unless they can see clinical pathology ( beri-beri , pellagra , scruvy , etc. ) . PMS is probably the best reason why every doctor being trained in the U.S. should get a good course on human nutrition . PMS is really only the tip if the iceberg when it comes to nutritional disorders . It 's time that medicine woke up and smelled the roses . Here 's some studies which show the importance in multivitamin/mineral supplementation and/or diet change in preventing PMS . Experimental Study , `` Effect of a nutritional programme on premenstrual syndrome : a retrospective analysis '' , Complement . Med . Res.5 ( 1 ) :8-11 ( 1991 ) . 200pts were given dietary instructions and supplemented with Optivite ( R ) plus additional vitamin C , vitamin E , magnesium , zinc and primrose oil . The dietary instructions were to take the supplements and switch to a low fat , complex carbohydrate diet . On a retrospective analysis , 96.5 % of the 200pts reported an improvement in their PMS symptoms with 30 % of the sample stating that they no longer suffered from PMS . Experimental Double-blind Study , `` Role of Nutrition in managing premenstrual tension syndromes '' , J Reprod . Med . 32 ( 6 ) :405-22 ( 1987 ) . A low fat , high complex carbohydrate diet along with Optivite supplementation significantly decreased PMS scores compared with diet change and placebo . After 6 months on the experimental program , the vitamin/mineral supplementated group had significantly decreased estradiol and increased progesterone in serum during the midlutel phase of their cycle . Experimental Double-blind Study , `` Clinical and biochemical effects of nutritional supplementation on the premenstrual syndrome '' , J. Reprod . Med . 32 ( 6 ) :435-41 ( 1987 ) . 119pts randomly given Optivite ( 12 tablets per day ) or a placebo . The treated groups showed a significant decrease in PMS symptoms compared to the placebo . Another group of 104pts got Optivite ( 4 tablets per day ) or placebo . For this second group of patients , no significant effect of supplementation on PMS symptoms was observed .

It has the solid , heavy feel of old-style Nikons and has taken all the abuse I have been able to give it .

Subject : PC BOARD Layout Help From : < EH1QC @ CUNYVM.BITNET > Organization : City University of New York Lines : 8 Hi , I have a few questions about laying out a PCB . I am using easytrax for dos which is a great program . But what my question is When laying out traces what thickness should they be ? I am mainly designing low voltage low current boards for micro controller apps . What should pad sizes be for resistors ? I will be turning to a commercial PCB maker to produce 1 's of these boards and I was wondering what is the minimum distance traces should be from each other . Well any info would be great . Thanks .

Me too , though unfortunately the `` Official Line '' is the one that you have to adhere to if you want to get a full licence . The examiner's guidelines are laid down by the government , and the basic rider education courses have no choice but to follow them . It surprises me that none of the rider groups here , either MAG or the BMF make much noise about the fact that the riding test requires you to ride three feet from the kerb all the time in order to pass , that the front brake must be applied before the rear , that you have to keep looking over your shoulder all the time ( instead of just when it is justified ) - there 's probably a few more too , which I can't think of for the moment . If the riding test could be rejigged a bit to include more of the real-world survival skills and less of the woefully simplistic crap that it contains now , then the accident figures would ( imho ) reduce still further . Do n't think we should include countersteering knowledge in our test though ... : - )

This is stupid . That is no paranoid assertion , it is testamony from surviving witnesses , and the BATF _has_ no tanks , nor am I aware of either the BATF _or_ the FBI using any until yesterday .

There are other laws and directives which bear upon the subject . For example , the National Computer Security Act of 1987 specifically directs NBS [ sic ] to work with NSA on developing security standards for civilian Federal computers . ( Pick up the bill from cpsr.org ; it also includes a report describing it , and some of the legislative history , including concerns about NSA 's involvement . ) Note also that NSA is specifically charged with running the National Computer Security Center , -- to quote the aforementioned report -- `` NSA also will work with industries at the DOD Computer Security Center to develop security standards for private sector use . '' It may or may not be a good idea to have NSA tinkering with this , but I 'm pretty sure it 's legal . ( Btw -- when it comes to development of cryptosystems , there may be two choices . Either NSA helped develop it , in which case maybe they can crack it , maybe not , but probably , no one else can ; or NSA did n't help , in which case they probably can crack it , and maybe others as well ... )

The deaths should be blamed on the people who dealt with > the demonstrations , or on the demonstrators themselves , if they were > violent . To what lengths will you go to justify this barbaric behaviour > against Rushdie ? Once the Rushdie situation exploded into the media , the Muslim voice on the matter of the book was effectively restricted to short video bytes showing the dramatic highlights of Muslim demonstrations . For every twenty or so newspaper , magazine articles , interviews etc . supporting Rushdie , there would appear one Muslim voice . This person was usually selected based on how dramatic and incoherent he was , not on his knowledge of Islam or the situation at the time . This approx . twenty to one ratio continued throughout the escalation of the crisis , with Rushdie in the central spotlight as the man of the moment , the valiant defender of everyman's right to free speech decoupled from responsibility . ( As an aside , it's interesting that while the hue and cry about freedom of speech went up , some books ( defaming certain ethnic and religious groups ) continued to be banned here . It was felt that they injured the sensibilities of these groups and presented a false image which could promote feelings of hate towards these groups . For Muslims this kind of double standard was annoying . ) Rushdie saw this spotlight as a golden opportunity to lash out at '' organized '' Islam , and he did so with admirable verbal skill . The only kind of Islam which Rushdie finds palatable is what he calls a `` secular '' Islam - an Islam separated from it 's Qur'an , it 's Prophet , God , its legislation , and most importantly from any intrusion into any political arena . Fine - Rushdie made his views known - the Muslim 's made their anger at his book known . The scale of the whole affair erupted into global proportions - it was , by this time , already a political situation - affecting governments as well as individuals . The situation was a serious one , with far-reaching political implications . At the centre of this turmoil was Rushdie , throwing fuel on the fire - engaged in a personal crusade that made him oblivious to any sense of caution . Now you may feel that the person in the centre of a worldwide storm such as this has no responsibility , has no reason to exercise restraint of any kind , has no obligation to perhaps step back momentarily out of the spotlight till matters calm down . Perhaps you even feel that he is justified in `` boldly '' defying the anger of all those who dare to take umbrage at his literary work , no matter what insult they find within it . Perhaps you see him as a kind of secular `` heroic Knight '' , mounted on the his media steed , doing battle with the `` dragon '' of Islamic `` fundamentalism '' . Well Khomeini saw him as a disingeneous author who grew up in a Muslim atmosphere , knew well what Muslim 's hold dear , who wrote a book which mischievously uses certain literary conventions to slander , insult , and attack Islam and its most notable personalities - who , when faced with a situation that became a worldwide crisis , continued with his mischief in the world stage of the media - who , even after people were injured and killed because of the magnitude and emotion of the situation , continued his mischief , instead of having the good sense to desist . Khomeini saw the crisis as mischief making on a grand scale , mischief making that grew in scale as the scale of the crisis enlarged . The deaths of Muslims around the world and Rushdie 's continued media mischief even after this , was the triggering factor that seemed to decide Khomeini on putting a stop to the mischief . The person at the centre of all these events was Rushdie - he was the source of the continuing mischief - all media support , government support was just that - support . The source was Rushdie ( and his publishers , who were nothing short of ecstatic at the publicity and were very happy to see Rushdie constantly in the media ) . The Islamic rulings that deal with people who engage in this kind of grand-scale mischief making , was applied to Rushdie . > You 're attempts at justification are not doing the > image of Islam any good . I have made no attempts at justification , only at explanation . `` Image '' is the chief concern of Muslim 'apologists ' for Islam and for Rushdie . If Muslims willingly relegated themselves to becoming a sub-culture within a larger secular culture , such that the secular principles and laws had precedence over the laws of Islam - then I have no doubt that Islam would then be thought to have a good `` image '' ( Principally because it would by and large reflect the secular image ) . A `` good image '' usually means `` be more like me '' . Your attempts at TOTALLY exonerating Rushdie reflect exactly the attitude that resulted in the polarization brought about by the crisis . > In Iran , the situation was monitored for many > > months - when Rushdie kept adding fuel to the flames through the free > > worldwide voice that the media gave him , the situation was monitored > > more seriously .

If Rushdie did n't mouth off so much in the media , the fuss would have died down - no one would have been killed , no fatwa would have been passed - the whole episode would have fizzled away .

The correct call is `` Infield Fly , ( batter out ) if fair '' . Runners may advance at own risk .

And guess why . Is n't it curious that we do not know how many people define in how many different ways the term Jew , which is the basis of the movement itself ?

I am not talking about individuals who defined themselves as zionists here . I am sure most of them are good , honest and caring people . I am talking about the results of the Zionist Movement . I am talking about a Movement whose actions resulted in a Law of Return with a religious definition of Jew , a country that defines nationality based on religion . I am talking about something I consider a form of racism such as differenciation based on religious belief .

Do n't have anything on that or the CEL format . Well , I dived in feet first and reverse engineered the .PRJ file as much as I needed to - extracted the mapping icon information - which is when it dawned on me that 3D Studio is useless for my needs . I need a mapping icon per applied texture . I want to use a special purpose graphics computer for rendering the 3DS models and it requires a texture rule/plane to be specified in 3Space , i.e . position/orientation of the mapping rule . Since only one mapping icon is used in 3DS to apply textures to ALL objects/faces , it renders ( no pun intended ) 3DS totally unsuitable for my needs . Anyone got a contact for Alias Upfront or any other good modeller for a PC ? I must be able to specify texture rules ( one per texture ) and this must be saved in a file which I can read . I have n't found any info on Alias in the copy of the faq that I have . Rych

'' but I have zero data on it . > > What do you know ? > > -- > Henry Melton I 'll tell you all that I know about chromium . But before I do , I want to get a few things off my chest . I just got blasted in e-mail for my kidney stone posts . Kidney stones are primarily caused by diet , as is heart disease and cancer . When I give dietary advise , it is not intended to encourage people reading this news group ( or Sci . Med . Nutrition where I do most of my posting ) to avoid seeing a doctor . Nothing can be further from the truth . Kidney stones can be caused by tumors and this possibility has to be ruled out . But once it is , diet is a good way of preventing a reoccurance . Same thing with heart disease and cancer , if you suspect that you may have a problem with one of these diseases , do n't use what I 'm going to tell you or what you read in some book to avoid going to a doctor . You have to go . Hopefully you will find a doctor who knows enough about nutrition to help you change your risk factors for both diseases as part of a treatment program ( but the odds are that you will not and that 's why I 'm here ) . When my wife detected a lump in here breast I did n't say , do n't worry my vitamin E will take care of it . Any breast lump has to be worked up by a physician , plan and simple . If it 's begnin ( which most are ) fine , then maybe a diet change and supplementation will prevent further breast lumps from occuring . But let me tell you right now , if you have tried diet and supplementation and another lump returns , get your butt into the doctor 's office as fast as your little feet can carry you ( better yet , have a mammography done on a regular basis , my wife kept putting her 's off , both myself and her gynocologist told her she needed to have one done ) . Her gynocologist even scheduled one , but she did n't show up ( too busy running the Operating Room for the biggest Hospital in Tulsa ) . One more thing , I am not an orthomolecular nutritionist . This group uses high dose vitamins and minerals to treat all kinds of disease . There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that vitamins and minerals can and do have drug actions in the body . But you talk about flying blind , man this is really blind treatment . No drug could ever be used as these vitamins and minerals are being used . I 'm not saying that some of this stuff could n't be right on the money , it may well be . But my approach to nutrition is a lot like that of Weinsier and Morgan , the two M.D 's who wrote the new Clinical Nutrition textbook . My push is the nutrient reserves and the lab tests needed to measure these reserves and then supplementation or diet changes to get these reserves built up to where they should be to let you handle stress . That 's where I 'm coming from folks . Blast away if you want , I 'm not going to change . Put me in your killfile if you want , I really do n't care . I 'm averaging 8-10 e-mail messages a day from people who think that I 've got something important to say . But I 'm also getting hit by a few with an axe to grind . That 's life . Chromium is one of the trace elements . It has a very limited ( but very important ) role in the body . It is used to form glucose tolerance factor ( GTF ) . GTF is made up of chromium , nicinamide ( niacin ) , glycine , cysteine and glutamic . Only the chromium and the niacin are needed from the diet to form GTF . Some foods already have GTF ( Liver , brewers or nutritional yeast , and black pepper ) . When chromium is in GTF , a pretty good absorption is seen ( about 20 % ) . But when it is simply present as a mineral or mineral chelate ( chromium picolinate ) it 's absorption is much lower ( 1 to 2 % , lowest for all the minerals ) . I 've been posting in Misc . Fitness and chromium has come up there several times as a `` fat burner '' . Chromium is among the least toxic of the minerals so you could really load yourself up and not really do any harm . I would n't do it though . The adequate and safe range for chromium is 50 to 200ug per day . The average American is getting about 30ug per day from his/her diet . Chromium levels decrease with age and many believe that adult onset diabetes is primarily a chromium deficiency . I can cite you several studies that have been done with glucose tolerance in Type II diabetes but I 'm not going to because for each positive one , there also seems to be a negative one as well . I 'm convinced that the problem is bioavailability . When yeast ( GTF ) is used , good results are obtained but when chromium itself is used the results are usually negative . In addition to Type II diabetes , chromiuum has been examined in cardiovascular disease and glucoma , again with mixed results as far as cardiovascular disease is concerned Since a high blood glucose level can lead to cardiovascular disease , this possible link with chromium is n't too surprising . Glucoma is a little more interesting . Muscle eye focusing activity is primarily an insulin responsive glucose-driven metabolic function . If this eye focusing activity is impaired ( by a lack of glucose due to a poor insulin response ) , intraocular pressure is believed to be elevated . In a fairly large study of 400 pts with glaucoma , the one consistent finding was a low RBC chromium . J . Am . Coll . Nutr . 10 ( 5 ) :536 , ( 1991 ) . But this one preliminary study should not prompt people to go out and start popping chromium supplements . For one thing , just about every older person is going to have a low RBC chromium unless they have been taking chromium suppleemnts ( yeast ) . Since glucoma is often found in older people , it 's not too surprising that chromium was low in the RBC 's . If chromium supplementation could reverse glucoma , that would prompt some attention . I suspect that there will be a clinical trail to check out this possible chromium link to glucoma . You could find out what your body chromium pool size was by either the RBC chromium test or hair analysis . Most clinical labs are not going to run a RBC chromium . There are plenty of labs that will do a hair and nail analysis for you , but I would n't use them . There is just too much funny business going on in these unregulated labs right now . Here 's Weinsier and Morgan , advise on chromium . They do not consider chromium to be one of those minerals for which a reliable clinical test is available ( they do n't like the hair and nail analysis labs either , and they also recognize the RBC chromium is primarily a research test that is not routinely available in most clinical chemistry labs ) . This has to change and as more labs run a RBC chromiuum , it will . What then do they suggest ? Make a diagnosis of chromium deficiency based on a documented clinical response to chromium ( run a glucose tolerance test before and after chromium supplementation ) . Once you make the diagnosis , put the patient on 200ug of CrCl3 orally each day or 10grams of yeast per day . What 's my advise ? Do n't take chromium supplements to try to loose weight ( they just do not work that way ) . If you want to take them and then exercise , that would be great . Do include yeast as part of your diet ( most Americans are not getting enough chromium from their diet ) . If you do have a poor glucose tolerance , ask your doctor to check your chromium status . When he or she says , `` what in the world are you talking about '' , just say , please get a copy of Weinsier and Morgan 's new Clinical Nutrition textbook and do what they say to do with patients who present with a poor glucose tolerance . If you ca n't do that , I 'll find a doctor who can , thank you very much . Marty B .

I copied the basic design of my function from the existing versions : static Bool next_savescreen ( scr , on ) ScreenPtr scr ; Bool on ; { /* this was copied from the omron server code -- is it the right way ? */ if ( on ! = SCREEN_SAVER_ON ) { nextSetLastEventTime ( ) ; } if ( on == SCREEN_SAVER_ON ) { /* Save user 's current setting */ next_save_screen_brightness = NXScreenBrightness ( my_eventhandle ) ; NXSetScreenBrightness ( my_eventhandle , 0.0 ) ; /* Blank the screen */ } else { /* Unblank the screen */ NXSetScreenBrightness ( my_eventhandle , next_save_screen_brightness ) ; } return TRUE ; } I can see in the server/os code where the screensaver is called to turn on the saver , but I can not find where it `` wakes up '' the server and unblanks the screen . Any tips/help would be appreciated .

This is not a fresh case of I do n't have the faintest idea what literature it is to which you refer . Is this an explicit statement by some document ? Or is it your interpretation of statements in such literature ? Or is this a figment of your imagination or a Nazi Armenian propaganda movie script ? In any case , a fascinating piece of analysis . Here are the facts : Source : Walker , Christopher : `` Armenia : The Survival of a Nation . '' New York ( St. Martin 's Press ) , 1980 . This generally pro-Armenian work contains the following information of direct relevance to the Nazi Holocaust : a ) Dro ( the butcher ) , the former dictator of x-Soviet Armenia and the architect of the genocide of 2.5 million Muslims , the most respected of Nazi Armenian leaders , established an Armenian Provisional Republic in Berlin during World War II ; b ) this 'provisional government ' fully endorsed and espoused the social theories of the Nazis , declared themselves and all Armenians to be members of the Aryan 'Super-Race ; ' c ) they published an Anti-Semitic , racist journal , thereby aligning themselves with the Nazis and their efforts to exterminate the Jews ; and , d ) they mobilized an Armenian Army of up to 30,000 members which fought side by side with the Wehrmacht . In fact , by 1942 , Nazi Armenians in Europe had established a vast network of pro-German collaborators , that extended over two continents . Thousands of Armenians were serving the German army and Waffen-SS in Russia and Western Europe . Armenians were involved in espionage and fifth-column activities for Hitler in the Balkans and Arabian Peninsula . They were promised an 'independent ' state under German 'protection ' in an agreement signed by the 'Armenian National Council . ' ( A copy of this agreement can be found in the 'Congressional Record , ' November 1 , 1945 ; see Document 1 . ) On this side of the Atlantic , Nazi Armenians were aware of their brethrens alliance . They had often expressed pro-Nazi sentiments until America entered the war . In 1941 , while the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Nazi concentration camps , the Nazi Armenians in Germany formed the first Armenian battalion to fight alongside the Nazis . In 1943 , this battalion had grown into eight battalions of 30,000-strong under the command of Dro ( the butcher ) , who was the former dictator of x-Soviet Armenia and the architect of the cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds between 1914-1920 . An Armenian National Council was formed by the notorious Dashnak Party leaders in Berlin , which was recognized by the Nazis . Encouraged by this , the Armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed and espoused fully the principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the members of the Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler 's policy of extermination of the Jews . This Armenian-Nazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an `` encore '' performance staged by the Armenians during WWI , when they back-stabbed and exterminated 2.5 million Muslims by colluding with the invading Russian army . Serdar Argic 'We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the Turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination . ' ( Ohanus Appressian - 1919 ) 'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists a single Turkish soul . ' ( Sahak Melkonian - 1920 )

To this day , Turkish historic lands remain occupied by the x-Soviet Armenia . In order to cover up the fact of its usurpation of the historic Turkish homeland , which is the crux of Turkish political demands , fascist x-Soviet Armenia continues its anti-Turkish policy in the following ways : 1. x-Soviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide in order to shift international public opinion away from its political responsibility . 2. x-Soviet Armenia , employing ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle , attempts to call into question the veracity of the Turkish Genocide . 3. x-Soviet Armenia has also implemented state-sponsored terrorism through the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to silence the Turkish people 's vehement demands and protests . 4 . Using all its human , financial , and governmental resources , x-Soviet Armenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence through terrorism , bribery and other subversive methods , non-Turkish supporters of the Turkish cause , be they political , governmental and humanitarian . Using all the aforementioned methods , the x-Soviet Armenian Government is attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community from making the Turkish Case a contemporary issue . Yet despite the efforts of the x-Soviet Armenian Government and its terrorist and revisionist organizations , in the last decades , thanks to the struggle of those whose closest ones have been systematically exterminated by the Armenians , the international wall of silence on this issue has begun to collapse , and consequently a number of governments and organizations have become supportive of the recognition of the Turkish Genocide . With the full knowledge that the struggle for the Turkish territorial demands are still in their initial stages , the Turkish and Kurdish people will unflaggingly continue in this sacred struggle , therefore the victims of the Turkish Genocide demand : 1. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government , as the heirs of the Armenian Dictatorship , recognize the Turkish Genocide ; 2. that x-Soviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish and Kurdish people ; 3. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government make material reparations for their heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide ; 4. that all world governments , and especially the United States , officially recognize the Turkish Genocide and Turkish territorial rights and refuse to succumb to all Armenian political pressure ; 5. that the U.S. Government free itself from the friendly position it has adopted towards its unreliable ally , x-Soviet Armenia , and officially recognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide as well as be supportive of the pursuit of Turkish territorial demands ; 6. that the x-Soviet Republics officially recognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide and include the cold-blooded extermination of 2.5 million Muslim people in their history books . Serdar Argic 'We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the Turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination . ' ( Ohanus Appressian - 1919 ) 'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists a single Turkish soul . ' ( Sahak Melkonian - 1920 )

Having watched most of the televised trial , I can answer that when such statements were made by the defense atty , the prosecutor did object , and the judge tended to sustain the ones that were obviously falling under the `` self-incrimination '' type of objection . There was quite a bit of meta-discussion during the trial over the use of graphic language , with most folks asking the judge if she wanted to hear the exact language . Practically every time the defense tried to get the plaintiffs to `` self-incriminate '' by asking them such questions , there were objections and sustains . At one point the defense managed to get in a quip about '' solicitation for a felony '' and the judge herself said `` sustained '' before the prosecutor could get the objection stated . -- G.

Yet another suggestion , but this one is non-toxic ( although I would handle it like any other cleaner ) and it smells nice . The chemical is called d-Limonene , and it smells like lemon peels ( I think it is a lemon extract of some kind ) . You might find it in a hardware store , sold as a general-purpose solvent , but your best bet would be any bike store -- it is used as a chain-cleaning fluid . It works on sticker glue , crayons , grease , oil , etc . It 's clear yellow in the bottle , and you can use it straight ; if you add water , it changes to a creamy consistency , which is good for some jobs . Peter

There is a fine line between `` getting players ' input '' and `` knuckling under to players ' demands . '' A manager , much like a military officer , needs to have his ( her ) players ' complete obedience and respect during a game . After the game , it 's no big deal , but when there is no time to do more than react , players must trust the manager or the team often falls apart ( see : Boston Red Sox , ff . : ) ) Strawberry 's demeanor as represented by the media , often sounds like demands . I suspect that a comment like `` I enjoy hitting fourth ; I'm used to it '' would get pretty brutally misinterpreted by the media if it came from Strawberry . Russ Porter quoted Strawberry as saying , '' I feel more comfortable hitting cleanup and I think I perform best in that role . '' ( Paraphrased by my memory and bias . ) That seems like a fairly non-petulant answer to what was almost certainly a question like , `` How do you feel about being moved to the third spot in the order ? '' A more media-sensitive player might answer `` The manager knows what he is doing . If he thinks that batting me third will help the team , then I am all for it . '' We 'd ignore that answer as brown stuff , so it seems a little bit of an overreaction to brand Darryl 's response as petulant . Personally , I think his argument is nonsense and that it really doesn't matter much in which order the # 2-5 players in the order are batted , except for personal stats . If I were Darryl , I 'd probably answer that question , `` The number four spot gets a few more RBI opportunities and I get paid for RBIs . I think it is best for me to bat fourth , but I am willing to hit third if Tommy thinks it will benefit the team . '' or something like that . It would be helpful at salary time -- my RBIs were down because I was hitting third -- and make him sound like a `` team '' player . Since Strawberry will not likely go through arbitration , but use the free agent market for his next contract , maybe that argument is useless , but it would help his image with the media without appearing to be totally content-free . Remember , the media is of the belief that one 's best RBI man should hit fourth , so the argument is sensible , regardless of whether or not it is true . -- Jeff
From : sharon @ world.std.com ( Sharon M Gartenberg ) Subject : From Srebrenica : `` Doctoring '' in Hell Summary : What it 's like WITHOUT modern medicine in war Organization : The World Public Access UNIX , Brookline , MA Lines : 84 SREBRENICA 'S DOCTOR RECOUNTS TOWN 'S LIVING HELL By Laura Pitter TUZLA , Bosnia , Reuter - Neret Mujanovic was a pathologist when he trekked through the mountains to the besieged Muslim town of Srebrenica last August . But after treating 4,000 mangled victims of Bosnia 's bloody war , he considers himself a surgeon . `` Now I 'm a surgeon with great experience although I have no license to practice . But if I operate on a person and he lives normally that 's the greatest license a surgeon could have . '' Evacuated by the U.N. this week to his home town of Tuzla , the Muslim physician gave an eyewitness medical assessment of the horrors of the year-long Serb siege of Srebrenica and the suffering of the thousands trapped there . `` I lived through hell together with the people of Srebrenica . All those who lived through this are the greatest heroes that humanity can produce , '' he told reporters . Mujanovic , 31 , had practiced for two months as an assistant at a local hospital in Tuzla , but before going to Srebrenica he had never performed a surgical operation on his own . Now he says he has performed major surgery 1,396 times , relying on books for guidance , amputating arms and legs 150 times , usually without anesthetic , delivering 350 babies and performing four cesarean sections . He worked 18-to-19-hour days , slept in the hospital for the first 10 weeks after his arrival last Aug. 5 and treated 4,000 patients . He arrived after making the trek over mountains on foot from Tuzla , 60 miles northwest of Srebrenica . About 50 other people carried in supplies and 350 soldiers guided and protected him through guerrilla terrain , he said . His worst memory was of 10 days ago when seven Serb shells landed within one minute in an area half the size of a football field , killing 36 people immediately and wounding 102 . Half of the dead were women and children . The people had come out for a rare day of sunshine and the children were playing soccer . `` There was no warning ... the blood flowed like a river in the street , '' he said . `` There were pieces of women all around and you could not piece them together . One woman holding her two children in her hands was lying with them on the ground dead . They had no heads . '' Before Mujanovic arrived with his supplies conditions were deplorable , he said . Many deaths could have been prevented had the hospital had surgical tools , facilities and medicine . The six general practitioners who had been operating before he arrived had even less surgical experience than he did . `` They did n't know the basic principles for amputating limbs . '' Once he arrived the situation improved , he said , but by mid-September he had run out of supplies . `` Bandages were washed and boiled five times ... sometimes they were falling apart in my hands , '' he said . Doctors had no anesthetic and could not give patients alcohol to numb the pain because it increased bleeding . `` People were completely conscious during amputations and stomach operations , '' he said . Blood transfusions were impossible because they had no facilities to test blood types . `` I felt destroyed psychologically , '' Mujanovic said . The situation improved after Dec. 4 , when a convoy arrived from the Belgian medical group Medecins Sans Frontieres . But Mujanovic said the military predicament worsened in mid-December after Bosnian Serbs began a major offensive in the region . `` Every day we had air strikes and shellings . '' Then the hunger set in . Between mid-December and mid-March , when U.S. planes began air dropping food , between 20 and 30 people were dying every day from complications associated with malnutrition , he said . `` I know for sure that the air drop operation saved the people from massive death by hunger and starvation , '' he said . According to Mujanovic , around 5,000 people died in Srebrenica , 1,000 of them children , during a year of siege . Mujanovic plans to return to Srebrenica in three weeks after visiting his wife , who is ill in Tuzla . `` They say I 'm a hero , '' he said . `` There were thousands of people standing at the sides of the road , crying and waving when I left . And I cried too . '' -- Sharon Machlis Gartenberg Framingham , MA USA e-mail : sharon @ world.std.com

Wright ( 1 ) Legitimate firearms retailers play only a minor role as direct sources of handguns for adult felony offenders . Only about one-sixth of the gun-owning felons obtained their most recent handguns through a customary retail transaction involving a licensed firearms dealer . The remainder -- five out of six -- obtained them via informal , off-the-record transactions involving friends and associates , family members , and various black market outlets . The means of acquisition from these informal sources included cash purchase , swaps and trades , borrowing and renting , and often theft . The criminal handgun market is overwhelmingly dominated by informal transactions and theft as mechanisms of supply . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - INDEPENDENCE ISSUE PAPER No . 4- 91 Independence Institute 14142 Denver West Parkway # 101 Golden , CO 80401 ( 303 ) 279-6536 WHY GUN WAITING PERIODS THREATEN PUBLIC SAFETY By David B. Kopel The basic problem with waiting periods is shown by a Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms study of gun dealer sales in Des Moines and Greenville . The study found that about one to two percent of sales were to dangerous criminals . [ 51 ] In short , waiting periods have no statistically noticeable impact on any type of crime because only a tiny fraction of crime guns are purchased at retail by ineligible buyers . 51 .

The NU study , authored by sociologists James D. Wright and Peter Rossi found that only sixteen percent of criminals had obtained their most recent handgun from a gun store . ( The figures included purchases by legal surrogates , rather than directly by the criminal . ) Wright and Rossi , who had begun their research as firm proponents of gun control , concluded that no set of controls on retail purchases , and probably not even full scale gun prohibition , would reduce criminal use of guns . Wright and Rossi suggested that lawmakers concerned about gun crime directly target the black market in criminal guns , and leave the legitimate retail market alone . { 98 } Not surprisingly , Wright believes that the consequences of current `` assault weapon '' legislation on street violence are likely to be ineffective . { 99 } He warns that gun controls aimed at ordinary citizens are less likely to reduce the pool of criminal guns than to provide organized crime with lucrative new business . { 100 } 6 . _See , _e.g. , The Anti-drug , Assault Weapons Limitation Act of 1989 .

Organization : NETCOM On-line Communication Services ( 408 241-9760 guest ) Lines : 28 My brother 's affine has recently been diagnosed with Sweet's syndrome . Also called steroid resistant Sweet 's syndrome . This syndrome started after she had had Iodine 131 treatment for hyperthyroidism . She 'd been reluctant to have treatment for the hyperthyroidism for many years and apparently started to show exaustion from it . I understand that she may still be testing high in thyroid level but she 's is n't being treated by an endocrinologist . Her previous endocrinologist bowed out when she entered the hospital . She entered the hospital because of the Sweet 's syndrome symptoms ( skin lesions ) . I 've looked through the last two years of Medline and did n't find an abstract mentioning a correlation between thyroid and Sweets . . I checked a handbook which said that Sweet 's was associated with leukemia . I 'd like a reccomndation for experts who are in New York City or who travel to New York City . For the sweets and perhaps for the endocrinology . Any information that might help . Apparently there has n't been much improvement in her condition over the past several months . -Jackie-

Organization : University of Western Ontario , London Nntp-Posting-Host : vega.irus.rri.uwo.ca Lines : 81 Hi : I need some advice ( opinions ? ) regarding which PC would best suit my needs ! I want to use this ( proposed ) beast for basically four things : - Editing documents using WordPerfect 5.1 ( under dos ) - Creating graphs/analyzing data using Sigmaplot V5.0 ( under dos ) - Editing/playing with images using Aldus PhotoStyler , running under Windows 3.1 - these images can be large , say 2k x 2k , 24bits/pixel - Using the PC as an Xterminal , running DesqView/X 1.1 and Sun PC-NFS , talking to our network of Sparcstation 's - this is where a lot of the images/data come from , and is the most demanding of these tasks . I 've read , read , read PC magazines , performed benchmarks , read this newsgroup , and decided that a `` nice '' system ( price/performance ) would be : 486DX-50 256k cache , ISA , VLB , 16meg ram ATI Graphics Ultra Pro , 2 meg ram , local bus 15 '' monitor , 1280x1024 NI 3Com Etherlink III 16bit Maxtor 240MB IDE hard drive However , the parts do n't fit ! Our local retailer apparently put one of these together , only to discover that the ATI card would n't run at 50MHz - surprise surprise . Actually , after reading this group , I 'm surprised that they even have a 50MHz local bus running ... I have a choice now between basically the above system but with a 486DX2-66 with ISA and VLB , or , a 486DX-50 with EISA and no VLB ( and thus the non-local bus version of the ATI card ) . Which is better , keeping in mind that I 'm primarily interested in the last two tasks ? Any help would be greatly appreciated ! ( I need to decide quickly , so any speedy help would be appreciated even more ! ! ) BTW : We have a system now to perform these tasks , it has the following configuration : 486DX-33 64k cache , ISA , 8 meg ram ATI Graphics Ultra+ , 2 meg ram 14 '' monitor , 1024x768 NI SMC Ethercard 8 bit Maxtor 120MB IDE hard drive We 're quite happy with the ATI card - very fast , ONCE the data gets to it ! ! ~Slow~ repainting images under PhotoStyler that have moved off screen , or been uncovered ! There does n't seem to be enough raw cpu when running DesqView/X ! Its sluggish running the local window manager . Also , many functions under PhotoStyler take a long time ( even when the images fit entirely in ram ) . There 's not enough memory in the system - DesqView/X and a 1 meg SmartDrive do n't leave much room for other apps . Photostyler will page to disk with medium size images . I have performed a number of benchmarks on the ethernet transfer rates . This machine sustains only 120k/sec over ethernet while our Sparcs sustain 600k/sec on the same network . Going to the 16 bit version of the SMC card increases transfer rates to 160k/sec - still very slow ( especially when moving large images ) . Is there such a thing as a local-bus ethernet card coming ? ? Will it make a difference ? I 'm hoping so , and leaning towards the 486DX2-66 choice ( above ) , for that reason . Also , are there DX2-100 's on the horizon ? What about DX3-99 's ? DX3-150 's ? ? ? !

God 's Word would command the people never to listen to or fear my words as I would be a false prophet . My bridges would be burnt forever . Perhaps I could repent and be saved , but I could never again be a prophet of God . In the light of this , it is critical that we speak when the Lord says speak and that we be silent when the Lord says to be silent lest we deprive the world of God 's Word and hide it under a bushel either by our inappropriate , cowardly silence or by our false statements . And because of this , it is critically important that we remain close to the Lord , in His Word , and in prayer , and filled with the Spirit of God so that we know the difference . In this day and age , sinners spout off their mouths left and right judging one another , claiming `` rights '' that are not theirs , denying rights that do indeed belong to others , demanding equal respect for all the `` gods '' of this world , and uttering every form of falseness that promises to make one feel good . It 's time that we christians give an example of honesty that stands out in contrast against this backdrop of falsehood . When we say , `` thus sayeth the Lord '' , it happens . When we pray , prayer is answered because we prayed right . When we say we 're christians , we really mean it .

My previous car had locking lugnuts that weighed about 2.5oz . more than the others . The locking lugnuts were factory equipment , and according to the factory service manual , after tire balancing the technician/mechanic was supposed to put a 1/2 oz . counterweight on the rim opposite the locking nut . I always had vibration problems with those stupid lugnuts since no one ever did the service correctly . I eventually got rid of the locking lugnuts and replaced them with the standard lugnuts . Unfortunately , I found out about the counterweighting technique 6 months after I got rid of the locking nuts . : - ( My present car , a Saturn SC , has locking lugnuts that I bought at the dealer and are made specifically for the Saturn . They have been made to be exactly the same weight as the non-locking lugnuts ( said so on the package and I verified it myself ) .

It is designed to be a simple and intuitive programming interface to access the functionality of commonly used widgets . Xm++ was initially created for the Motif widget set , now support for the Athena widgets was added . Applications created with Xm++ run in both environments without changes , although many nice features are only available when using Motif . In some situations Xm++ extends the underlying toolkit ( i.e . providing a ComboBox borrowed from MS-Windows ) , but never tries to replace it - data of user interface objects is left to the widgets and only duplicated in rare cases . Xm++ has nothing common with Motif++ besides the general idea to encapsulate Motif widgets in C++ objects and the '++ ' in it 's name . Many ideas for the Xm++ architecture came from Digitalk 's Smalltalk version , which provides an easy to use framework for Windows/PM/Mac applications ( in the very first time of development I used the Windows dialog editor and a simple parser to create similar Smalltalk and Xm++ dialogs : - ) . Top level objects in Xm++ : * 'Windows ' , 'SystemDialogs ' and 'ToolBoxes ' which use the automatic layout feature of various composite widgets in Motif and Xaw * 'UserDialogs ' which can be individually laid out with a user interface builder ( a first version of such a dialog editor is included in this distribution ) Controls ( children of top level objects ) : 'staticText ' , 'staticImage ' , 'pushButton ' , 'checkBox ' , 'radioButton ' , 'edit ' , 'listBox ' , 'comboBox ' , 'groupBox ' , 'paneArea ' , 'drawing ' , 'toolBar' The staticImage and all the button classes can display b/w ( X-bitmap format ) or color ( GIF format ) pictures as an alternative to a label text . Event handling is done by a simple but powerful mechanism which redirects Xt callbacks to member functions of Xm++ objects . CommonInteract ( II ) is built upon the Xm++ drawing class and provides components for building direct manipulative applications . Is is a very simplified implementation of some features from the CommonInteract system ( research project of our institute in 1991 ) , an approach to define a software achitecture for implementing direct manipulative applications with multiple interaction media ( i.e . sound , alternative input devices ) . If you are interrested , look into the June 1993 issue of the JOOP ( SIGS Publications - Journal of Object Oriented Programming ) - there should be our paper about CommonInteract ( but be aware , that it is our 'state of the art ' from 1991 ) . CommonInteract ( II ) is still undocumented and is included because it was used to implement the dialog editor . It currently supports only drawing primitives ( lines , rectangles , circles ... ) , but we plan to extend it to support bitmaps and some controls also . Known problem : the Xm++ drawing class has no redrawing strategy ( always redraws the whole window , even after minimal changes like selecting an object ) , this looks very ugly on slow displays and should be fixed . About this first release : Xm++ is still incomplete and has a lot of bugs but we are using it here for smaller applications which are running without problems . So I think I can call it a 'beta release ' which can be used to develop applications for any non-critical purposes . CommonInteract may be called a 'pre alpha release ' . It 's development will be continued this year because we plan to use it for another research project here . Besides incompleteness and the redrawing problem it seems to be stable and can be used for experimental applications . Platforms : this release was compiled and tested on : HP9000/720 running HP-UX 8.07 SUN SPARC running SunOS Release 4.1.1 PC-AT386 running Linux v0.99pl6 Caution : although the whole stuff was initially developed using an AT & T standard C++ compiler - this release is tested only with GNU g++ 2.3.3 or above ( the next release will be tested with both compilers ) .

What you described SOUNDS the same to me . In fact , what little & i 've studied on trannies , the instructor referred to the synchros as `` dogs '' & and said they were synonymous . The gears are always meshed in a synchronized & gearbox , and you slip the synchro gears back and forth by shifting . Or at least , & that is what i was taught . Explain , por favour ? Motorcycle transmissions do n't have synchros . The engagment dogs are very corse and sloppy . There are maybe 6-10 teeth ( dogs ) on the side of the gears that engage the next gear over as the forks slide the gears back and forth . To shift : start to apply pressure at the same time the clutch is pulled ( the clutch is a hand lever ) and shift quickly . If you try a slow lazy shift it will grind , you just have to pop it into the next gear before it has a chance to grind . There is n't a neutral between gears ( obviously there is , but you ca n't select it with the shifter ) so double clutching is not a possibility . `` speed shifting '' ( which is what I have always heard `` clutchless shifting '' called ) works pretty well for upshifts with some practice , but I usually use the clutch-especially for the lower gears . I think auto ( as in automobile ) trannys are similar , except that the engagment dogs are very fine , with no slop . And the addition of syncho rings . The gear teeth are always engaged in auto transmissions that are synchronized , but may not be in non-synchro gears ( reverse and sometimes first ) . -- Frank Ball 1UR-M frankb @ sad.hp.com ( 707 ) 794-4168 work , Hewlett Packard ( 707 ) 794-3844 fax , ( 707 ) 538-3693 home 1212 Valley House Drive IT175 , XT350 , Seca 750 , '62 F-100 , PL510 Rohnert Park CA 94928-4999 KC6WUG , LAW , AMA , Dod # 7566 , I 'm the NRA .

From : JEK @ cu.nih.gov Subject : Hell Lines : 41 On 20 April , Stephen McIntyre writes : > I would rather spend an eternity in Hell than be beside God in > Heaven knowing that even one man would spend his `` eternal life '' > being scorched for his wrongdoings ... . Stephen , I suspect that when you and I use the word `` Hell , '' we have different concepts in mind . When you encounter references to Heaven in terms of crowns and harps and golden streets , I trust that you do not suppose ( or suspect Christians of supposing ) that the golden streets are to be taken literally , still less that they are what the concept of Heaven is all about . Why then should you suppose that about the `` fires '' of Hell ? Have you read the novel ATLAS SHRUGGED ? Do you remember the last description of James Taggart , sitting on the floor beside the Ferris Persuader ? This comes close to a description of what is meant by Hell in my circles . If the image of fire is often used in this connection , there are two reasons that occur to me . The first reason is that it conveys the idea of Hell as something that any rational being would earnestly wish to avoid ( as any rational being would wish to avoid the fate of James Taggart -- but the latter image is meaningful only to those who have read ATLAS SHRUGGED , a smaller audience than those who have played with matches ) . The second reason is the history of the Hebrew word `` Gehenna , '' one of the words translated `` Hell '' in the New Testament . It refers to the valley of Hinnon , outside Jerusalem . In early days , it was a place where the Canaanites offered human sacrifices ( burned alive ) to Molech . Later , it was made a garbage or refuse dump , where fires burned continually , consuming the trash of the city of Jerusalem . `` To be cast into Gehenna '' or `` to burn in Gehenna '' thus became a metaphor for `` to be rejected or discarded as worthless . '' Lest you think that identifying Hell with the fate of James Taggart is my own private fancy , I commend to you the book THE GREAT DIVORCE , by C S Lewis . It discusses Heaven ( no harps ) and Hell ( no flames ) . It is shorter than ATLAS SHRUGGED , and available at most bookstores and libraries . Yours , James Kiefer

But what I do n't understand is that they cut the OT just show some stupid baseball news which is not important at all . Then I waited for the scores to comeon Sportscenter , but they talk about Baseball , basketball and football . Then they showed Penguine highlight and went back to stupid basketball . Finally they showed a highlight of the OT goal but that was like 30 sec . I think they should give more attention to NHl during the playoffs then talking about boring basketball games.. I guess it is NHL 's fault too for leaving ESPN . Hope things improve by next season ...

The BATF is a part of the dept . of treasury , not justice . If they needed to assault a place they could just do like the IRS does ... call in the federal marshalls service , their fugitive collection teams do similar type assaults all the time . And they are very , very good about it , in both the tactical and legal parts of it . But I suspect that the marshalls would not have touched it , because the search warrant ( which is still sealed I believe ) was so bogus . Besides the BATF also could have gotton SWAT teams from : federal marshalls service ; FBI ; secret service ; national park service ; texas rangers ; nearby large city police forces ; the military . But they had to use their own guys , nobody elses SWAT team was good enough for the holy cause of gun control . I also find the timing of the raid to be extremely interesting . Initial raid : two days before the NJ senate was going to overturn their '' assault weapon '' confiscation law ; a couple weeks before the BATF 's budget was going to come up in congress for review ; shortly after Reno got confirmed as AG ( I do n't need to remind you about her anti-gun line ) ; right around the presidents 100th day in office .

I just got back from the American Academy of Neurology annual meeting , where the consensus was that sumatriptan ( Imitrex ) has no advantages over DHE-45 nasal spray , which is much less expensive , has fewer side effects , is as effective , and works more quickly ( 5-10 minutes vs. 30 ) . Besides , who wants to give themselves a shot ( sumatriptan ) when a nasal spray works ?

From : gorgen @ ann-arbor.applicon.slb.com ( David Gorgen ) Subject : Need help : Z-buffering lines & areas together Organization : Applicon , Inc. ; Ann Arbor , MI ( USA ) Keywords : Z-buffer , roundoff , lines , areas Lines : 84 I 'm asking for help on a sticky problem involving unreasonably low apparent precision in Z-buffering , that I 've encountered in 2 different PEX implementations . I ca n't find any discussion of this problem in any resources I can lay hands on ( e.g . the comp.windows.x.pex FAQ , Gaskins's _PEXlib_Programming_Manual_ , vendors ' documentation ) . I 'm posting this article by itself on comp.graphics , and virtually the same article with a test program demonstrating the problem on comp.windows.x.pex . The problem is hard to describe without pictures , hence this article is longish . If you can run PEXlib 5.x programs and are interested , I encourage you to build and run the test program in comp.windows.x.pex to see the effect yourself and play with my approach to dealing with it . ( It depends on the utility code from the above Gaskins book ; instructions for fetching it via anonymous FTP are given . ) The problem to be solved is to eliminate or minimize `` stitching '' artifacts resulting from the use of Z-buffering with polylines that are coplanar with filled areas . The interpolated Z values along a line will differ slightly , due to roundoff error , from the interpolated Z values across an area , even when the endpoints of the line are coincident with vertices of the area . Because of this , it 's a tossup whether the Z-buffer will allow the line pixels or the area pixels to be displayed . Visually , the result tends to be a dashed-line effect even though the line is supposed to be solid . Using the PEXlib API , my approach to a solution is to use two slightly different PEX view mapping transforms , in two view table entries , one for the areas and one for the lines . The PEX structures or immediate- mode output must be organized so that one view table index is always in effect for areas , and the other is always in effect for lines . The result is a slight shift in NPC Z coordinates for the lines , so as to attempt to bias the tossup situations in favor of the lines . This shift is effected by moving the front and back clipping planes used in the PEXlib view table entry for lines just a hair `` backwards '' ( i.e . smaller VRC Z coordinates ) , compared to their positions in the view table entry used for areas . This means that when a point is transformed to NPC , its Z value will be slightly bigger if it comes from a line than if it comes from an area , thus accomplishing the desired bias . I would expect the Z roundoff errors which cause the problem to amount to a few units at most , out of the entire dynamic range of the Z-buffer , typically from 0 to 65535 if not 16777215 ( i.e . 16 or 24 bit Z-buffers ) . Therefore , it seems that a tiny fraction of the range of Z in VRC between the front and back clip planes ought to suffice to reliably fix the stitching . But in fact , experience shows that the shift has to be as much as 0.003 to 0.006 of the range . ( Empirically , it 's worst when the NPC Z component of the slope of the surface is high , i.e . when it appears more or less edge-on to the viewer . ) It 's as if only 8 or 9 bits of the Z-buffer have any dependable meaning ! This amount is so great that one problem is replaced by another : sometimes the polylines `` show through '' areas which they are supposed to lie behind . I 've observed the problem on both Hewlett-Packard and Digital workstation PEX servers , to approximately the same degree . The test program demonstrates the problem on an MIT PEXlib 5.x implementation ; this version is known to compile and run on an HP-UX system with PEX 5.1 . Open questions : ( 1 ) Why does this happen ? -- Am I configuring the PEX view table wrongly ? -- Is there a systematic difference in Z interpolation for lines as opposed to areas ( e.g . pixel centers versus corners ) which could be corrected for ? -- Are PEX implementors wantonly discarding Z precision in their interpolators ? -- Something else ? ( 2 ) What to do about it ? -- Can I fix my use of the view table to allow better precision in Z-buffered HLHSR ? -- Is there another approach I can take to remove the stitching artifacts ? -- Am I just out of luck ? Any help would be immensely appreciated ! -- =============================================================================== Dave Gorgen Internet : gorgen @ ann-arbor.applicon.slb.com Applicon Inc. gorgen @ aaaca1.sinet.slb.com Ann Arbor , Michigan ( USA ) UUCP : ... ! uunet ! sharkey ! applga ! gorgen

From : ohandley @ betsy.gsfc.nasa.gov Subject : Schatzki Ring/ PVC's Reply-To : ohandley @ betsy.gsfc.nasa.gov Organization : NASA Goddard Space Flight Center - Greenbelt , MD USA Lines : 49 Can anybody out there provide me with any advice concerning the following two health problems : First , I was recently diagnosed ( using a UGI series ) as having a Schatzki ring and small sliding hiatal hernia . As I understand it , the hernia is a relatively minor problem , though I do occasionally have some nasty heartburn that is probably related to it . The Schatzki ring , on the other hand , is causing swallowing difficulty . In particular , if I 'm not careful about eating slowly , and thoroughly chewing food , food occasionally gets `` stuck '' before reaching my stomach . This results in a period of painful spasms as the food attempts to pass the obstruction . Fortunately , the food has always managed to pass , but this is annoying , and causes frequent discomfort . My doctor wants to `` dilate '' the ring using the following procedure : use an endoscope to examine the esophagus and stomach for any inflammation , then cut through the ring and dilate it by passing some kind of balloon or something thru the esophagous . I would like to know if anyone out there has had this ( or a similar ) procedure done-if so , was it painful , successful , etc . Also , can anyone comment on safety , advisability , and success rate of this procedure ? Has it become a common procedure ? I am kind of leery of having such an invasive-sounding procedure performed for a ( currently ) non-threatening condition such as this , especially considering the possible side effects ( bleeding , perforation , reaction to anesthesia ) . The second issue : for the past 3-4 years I have had a large number of `` extra '' heartbeats . In particular , during the past month or so there has been a dramatic increase-a Holter monitor recently showed 50 PVC 's in 24 hrs , along with a few PAC 's . ( Many days , there are far more than this , however-five to ten per hour ) . All of them were isolated , and the cardiologist indicated that such a number was `` normal '' . It certainly doesn't feel normal . In the past there have also been a couple of episodes of extended `` runs '' of these beats , one of which lasted long enough to cause severe light-headedness . I am relatively young ( 30-ish ) , thin and in good health ( recent bloodtests were all normal ) , and do not smoke , use drugs or caffeine , etc . I 'm willing to accept the extra beats as `` normal '' , but don't want to ignore them if they might be some kind of warning symptom . The number of PVC 's seems to increase throughout the day , and with exercise ( or something as simple as climbing some stairs ) . Also , if I get up after sitting or lying down for a while , I tend to get a couple of extra beats . Could they possibly be related to the esophagous problems ? Both seemed to develop at about the same time .

Actually , severe headaches due to stopped up sinuses ( plugged ostia ) are possible , and sinus surgery which widens the ostia - from the normal 2 mm to about 10 mm - should relieve this . There are non-surgical ways , however , to keep the ostia open ( however , in a few individuals , their ostia are naturally very small ) , and Dr. Ivker 's book talks about this . The underlying cause of chronic sinusitis is NOT cured by this kind of sinus surgery , though . About asthma , that 's a little more controversial . Dr. Ivker , in his book , '' Sinus Survival '' , *speculates* ( and says it 's not proven ) , that many cases of asthma are triggered by chronic sinusitis due to the excessive drainage ( postnasal drip ) from the sinuses . He 's had many patients who 've found relief from asthma when the chronic sinusitis is reduced or eliminated - not clinical proof , but compelling anecdotal information of this speculation . Before doing any sinus surgery , first get THE BOOK - it discusses surgery , as well as a good non-surgical treatment program for chronic sinusitis .

I have n't read this entire thread , but , if someone has n't tossed this out yet , then here it is : 2 Samuel 12:21-23 ( RSV ) : `` Then his servants said to him , ` What is this thing that you have done ? You fasted and wept for the child while it was alive ; but when the child died , you arose and ate food . ' He [ David ] said , 'While the child was still alive , I fasted and wept ; for I said , 'Who knows whether the LORD will be gracious to me , that the child may live ? ' But now he is dead ; why should I fast ? Can I bring him back again ? I shall go to him , but he will not return to me . ' '' Anyhow , many interpret this to mean that the child has gone to Heaven ( where David will someday go ) . I do n't claim to know for sure if this applies to all babies or not .

Perhaps I failed to make myself clear : Minorities in the U.S. *correlate* with poverty . This is n't good and we should address it , but we shouldnt ' ignore that minorities and poverty *do* tend to go together . *Does* Vancouver have a consistantly poor population drawn along racial lines ?

So we 've got a situation where we have several options : 1 ) The crime rate decreased : Obviously gun control worked . 2 ) The crime rate remained the same : It would have been worse without gun control . 3 ) The crime rate increased : Perhaps the laws prevented an even bigger increase . Cute testing ground we 've got . All responses support the proposition that gun control works . The question is this : Did Washington D.C. experiance an increase in its violent and/or gun crime rate which was greater than the pattern indicated prior to the implemented gun control laws . If it did , then the suggestion that the problem the gun control laws were designed to '' control '' did not exist in their entirety prior to the gun control laws . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- David Veal Univ . of Tenn.

Good point , Brett . It might merely be proof that basic health care markets operate differently , with certain nonmarket phenomenom that the private sector ca n't handle well ( like armies vs. warlords ) .

Good point again . Blue Cross in the U.S. is quite convoluted compared to the Canadian and German insurance funds , which have a minimal organization to coordinate it . If anything , bureaucracy now needs to be built up in Canada to combat fraud , such as Americans crossing the border individually to use insurance cards borrowed from friends and relatives or using phony domestic addresses , or fraud rings stealing them in blocks . Our private practices are now recording insurance account numbers , both public insurance and private insurance , which most have never bothered to do before on assumption of an honour system . gld -- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Je me souviens ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Gary L.

Suggestions ? Glad to hear that the bozo managed to stop . I 've only been riding for about two years , but here are my rules for traffic light survival : - I try to *never* stop just over a hill behind a car . If I have to stop in such a location , I pull almost completely next to the car in front of me . If I 'm the only one ( ie no car in front ) , I turn the bike somewhat sideways across the lane , to increase my visibility to any oncoming vehicle . Make sure to keep your taillight visible to traffic , though . ( NOTE : My bike is bright white ; turning sideways on a black bike might not be as beneficial . ) - On a flat road , I stop with a bit of room ahead of me ( usually about two or three bike lengths ) . This will ( hopefully ) give me room to pull forward and to the side as a car approaches . - If you are the last in a line of vehicles , watch your mirrors *constantly ! * If you see a vehicle approaching , and ca n't see any evidence to indicate that he/she is slowing down , get out of the way *now ! * - Flicker your brake light . If I 'm the last vehicle in line , I will pull and release the brake as a car approaches from behind ( noticed the car by watching my mirrors , of course : - ) . I vary the speed of the flicker , hoping to make the cager notice that there 's something in the lane ahead of him . Now , with all that said , it 's the situation where you are first in line that I feel most defenseless . If you 're first in line , your forward escape route is seriously limited - you can only move forward to the extent that you do n't enter the intersection . I leave some room behind the stop line ( although around here , the # @ $ * ! light activators are always right up next to the stop line ! ) , and watch the mirrors . I *think* I 've decided that hopping off the bike might be the best way out of this situation . Any other ideas for being first in line with no traffic directly behind you ? -rob . -- Rob Griffiths | Erasure.ShonaLaing.WildSwans.B52s.U2.JudyBats.REM.Smiths robg @ apple.com | FAA Certified cloud basher I wan na drive the Zamboni !

This is important since he struggles > so much with breaking balls . Opposing pitchers do n't want to > walk Williams to get to Bonds . Both your reasons are not good ones . Joe Morgan thinks that Bonds-Clark- Williams should be the 3-4-5 hitters . While he believes that Clark-Bonds- Williams is fine , he definitely is of the opinion that Bonds should hit ahead of Williams . I am inclined to agree with him . Your first reason is not valid because Bonds can hit both lefties and righties very well . He hits lefties or righties better than any other Giant Williams is still getting breaking balls although not as much as last season . But , the bottom line is Bonds is a far more disciplined and more productive hitter than Williams , and I prefer to take my chances with Bonds driving in the 1 , 2 or 3 hitters ( who are expected to have high OBPs ) than with Williams . Williams would get more fastballs with Bonds on first and second base open because of the threat of Bonds stealing .

Shaw , 'The Jews of the Ottoman Empire and the Turkish Republic , ' New York University Press , New York ( 1991 ) . pages 202-203 : < < In 1865 , immediately after enactment of the new Organic Statute for the Jewish community , and just as Jewish capital from Europe was beginning to have an effect in Istanbul , local Armenians and Greeks started a pogrom against Jews immediately across the sea of Marmara at Haydarpasa , terminus of the Anatolia railroad , with three hundred Jews massacred and many more beaten and raped before the disturbance was stopped after the Sultan sent his personal guard across the bay to protect the Jews [ 39 ] . In later years , ritual murder attacks against Jews , carried out mostly by native Greeks , Armenians , and , in Arab provinces , by Maronites and other Arab Christians , often with the assistance of the local European consuls , took place throughout the empire . There were literally thousands of incidents continuously until World War I , in Southeastern Europe as far west and north as Monastir and Kavalla , in Istanbul , at Gallipoli and the Dardanelles , at Salonica , and in all the Arab provinces as far south as Damascus and Beirut and in Egypt at Cairo and Alexandria . These invariably resulted from accusations spread among Ottoman Christians by word of mouth , or published in their newspapers , often by Christian financiers and merchants anxious to get their Jewish competitors out of the way or to divert onto the Jews Muslim anger at reports of Christian massacres of Muslims in Southeastern Europe or Central Asia , resulting in individual and mob attacks on Jews , and the burning of their shops and homes . Individual experiences were horrible . Jews constantly went in fear of Armenian or Greek attacks in the streets of Ottoman cities . In Egypt and Syria , it was usually the Greeks who led the way , in many cases with the assistance of local Armenians and Syrian Christians , whose Greek , Arabic and French-language newspapers often printed all the rumors they could find regarding Jews , evidently with the desire of instigating violence . The Syrian Arab Christians in particular spread their long-standing anti-Semitic hatreds from Syria to Egypt , where their monopoly of the local press and their espousal of popular causes such as Egyptian nationalism and opposition to the British rule , enabled them to spread their anti-Jewish message among the Muslim masses with little question or opposition . On 20 June 1890 , thus , Sir Evelyn Baring ( later Lord Cromer ) , British High Commissioner in Egypt , received the following report from David and Nissim Ades , in Cairo : `` Sir , I beg sir to draw to your attention to the violent articles which has ( sic ) appeared in an Arabic paper called El Mahroussa which contained nothing but lies and false accusations against the Jews , especially those ( the issues ) of the 14th , 17th and 19th instant . Now , Sir , are we to have here an anti-Semitic party amidst fanaticism , Greeks , Armenians , etc. , or is he to be allowed to continue to poison the people 's minds with exaggeration and painted words ? In an article , he asserted that the Jews use Christian blood for Passover , of course this has caused a deal of excitement . '' [ 40 ] Whenever Greek and other Orthodox religious authorities or prominent Greek business leaders or consuls were asked to help to stem the violence or reduce tension , they invariably indicated their cooperation and then failed to do anything to prevent attacks or punish those who stimulated or led them . [ 41 ] The leader of the Ashkenazi community of Corlu complained to the president of AIU [ Alliance Israelite Universelle ] in 1902 about persistent Greek attacks against its Jewish quarter : `` The fanatic Greeks of our city , as of other places in Thrace , have the habit of , contrary to the spirit of real Christianity , making a replica of Judas Iscariote and of burning it on the night of Holy Saturday .

From : Clinton-HQ @ Campaign92.Org ( The White House ) Subject : CLINTON : President 's Press Conference 4.23.93 Organization : MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab Lines : 838 NNTP-Posting-Host : life.ai.mit.edu THE WHITE HOUSE Office of the Press Secretary ______________________________________________________________ For Immediate Release April 23 , 1993 PRESS CONFERENCE BY THE PRESIDENT The East Room 1:00 P.M. EDT THE PRESIDENT : Terry , do you have a question ? Q Mr. President , there 's a growing feeling that the Western response to bloodshed in Bosnia has been woefully inadequate . Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel asked you yesterday to do something , anything to stop the fighting . Is the United States considering taking unilateral action such as air strikes against Serb artillery sites ? THE PRESIDENT : Well , first let me say , as you know , for more than a week now we have been seriously reviewing our options for further action . And I want to say , too , let 's look at the last three months . Since I became President I have worked with our allies and we have tried to move forward , first on the no-fly zone , on enforcement of it , on the humanitarian airdrops , on the war crimes investigation , on getting the Bosnian Muslims involved in the peace process . We have made some progress . And now we have a very much tougher sanctions resolution . And Leon Fuerth , who is the National Security Advisor to the Vice President , is in Europe now working on implementing that . That is going to make a big difference to Serbia . And we are reviewing other options . I think we should act . We should lead -- the United States should lead . We have led for the last three months . We have moved the coalition . And to be fair , our allies in Europe have been willing to do their part . And they have troops on the ground there . But I do not think we should act alone , unilaterally , nor do I think we will have to . And in the next several days I think we will finalize the extensive review which has been going on and which has taken a lot of my time , as well as the time of the administration , as it should have , over the last 10 days or so . I think we 'll finish that in the near future and then we 'll have a policy and we 'll announce it and everybody can evaluate it . Q Can I follow up ? THE PRESIDENT : Sure . Q Do you see any parallel between the ethnic cleansing in Bosnia and the Holocaust ? THE PRESIDENT : I think the Holocaust is on a whole different level . I think it is without precedent or peer in human history . On the other hand , ethnic cleansing is the kind of inhumanity that the Holocaust took to the nth degree . The idea of moving people around and abusing them and often killing them solely because of their ethnicity is an abhorrent thing . And it is especially troublesome in that area where people of different ethnic groups live side by side for so long together . And I think you have to stand up against it . I think it 's wrong . We were talking today about all of the other troubles in that region . I was happy to see the violence between the Croats and the Muslims in Bosnia subside this morning , and I think we 're making progress on that front . But what 's going on with the Serbians and the ethnic cleansing is qualitatively different than the other conflicts , both within the former Yugoslavia and in other parts of the region . Q Mr. President , by any count , you have not had a good week in your presidency . The tragedy in Waco , the defeat of your stimulus bill , the standoff in Bosnia . What did you do wrong and what are you going to do differently ? How do you look at things ? Are you reassessing ? ( Laughter . ) THE PRESIDENT : I do n't really believe that the situation in Bosnia -- it 's not been a good week for the world , but I do n't know that the administration could have made it different . On the stimulus package , I 'd like to put it into the larger context and remind you that in this 100 days we have already fundamentally changed the direction of an American government . We have abandoned trickle-down economics . We 've abandoned the policies that brought the debt of this country from $ 1 trillion to $ 4 trillion in only a decade . The budget plan , which passed the Congress , which will reduce the deficit and increase investment , has led to a 20-year low in mortgage rates , dramatically lower interest rates . There are probably people in this room who have refinanced their home mortgages in the last three months , or who have had access to cheaper credit . That 's going to put tens of billion dollars coursing throughout this economy in ways that are very , very good for the country . And so we are moving in the right direction economically . I regret that the stimulus did not pass , and I have begun to ask -- and will continue to ask not only people in the administration , but people in the Congress whether there is something I could have done differently to pass that . Part of the reason it did n't pass was politics ; part of it was a difference in ideas . There are really people still who believe that it 's not needed . I just disagree with that . I think the recovery -- the economists say it 's been underway for about two years , and we 've still had 16 months of seven- percent unemployment , and all the wealthy countries are having trouble creating jobs . So I think there was an idea base -- an argument there , that while we 're waiting for the lower interest rates and the deficit reduction and the investments of the next four years to take effect , this sort of supplemental appropriation should go forward . Now , I have to tell you , I did misgauge that because a majority of the Republican senators now sitting in the Senate voted for a similar stimulus when Ronald Reagan was President in 1983 , and voted 28 times for regular supplemental appropriations like this . I just misgauged it . And I hope that I can learn something . I 've just been here 90 days . And , you know , I was a Governor working with a contentious legislature for 12 years , and it took me a decade to get political reform there . So it takes time to change things . But I basically feel very good about what 's happened in the first 100 days with regard to the Congress . Q Waco -- THE PRESIDENT : Well , with regard to Waco I do n't have much to add to what I 've already said . I think it is a -- I want the situation looked into . I want us to bring in people who have any insights to bear on that . I think it 's very important that the whole thing be thoroughly gone over . But I still maintain what I said from the beginning , that the offender there was David Koresh . And I do not think the United States government is responsible for the fact that a bunch of fanatics decided to kill themselves . And I 'm sorry that they killed their children . Q Mr. President , to follow up partly on Helen on your stimulus package and on your political approach to Capitol Hill , Ross Perot said today that you 're playing games with the American people in your tax policy . He was strongly critical of your stimulus package . He said he 's going to launch an advertising campaign against the North American Free Trade Agreement . How are you going to handle his political criticism ? Will it complicate your efforts on the Hill with your economic plan ? And do you plan to repackage some of the things that have been in your stimulus program and try to resubmit them to the Hill ? THE PRESIDENT : Let me answer that question first . We 're going to revisit all of that over the next few days . I 'm going to be talking to members of Congress and to others to see what we can do about that . With regard to the economic plan , I must say I found that rather amazing . I do n't want to get into an argument with Mr. Perot . I 'll be interested to hear what his specifics are , but I would -- go back and read his book and his plan . There 's a remarkable convergence except that we have more specific budget cuts , we raise taxes less on the middle class and more on the wealthy . But , otherwise , the plans are remarkably similar . So I think it would be -- I 'll be interested to see if maybe perhaps he 's changed his position from his book last year and he has some new ideas to bring to bear . I 'll be glad to hear them . Q To follow up , sir , how do you plan to handle his political criticism ? He 's launched a campaign against you . Do you think you can sit back and just -- THE PRESIDENT : Well , first of all , I will ask you to apply the same level of scrutiny to him as you do to me . And if he 's changed his position from the positions he took in the campaign last year , then we need to know why and what his ideas are . Maybe he 's got some constructive ideas . I think the American people have shown that they 're very impatient with people who do n't want to produce results . And the one thing I think that everybody has figured out about me in the last -- even if they do n't agree with what I do -- is that I want to get something done . I just came here to try to change things . I want to do things . And I want to do things that help people 's lives . So my judgment is that if he makes a suggestion that is good , that is constructive , that takes us beyond some idea I 've proposed that will change people 's lives for the better , fine . But I think that that ought to be the test that we apply to everyone who weighs into this debate and not just to the President . Q Mr. President , to go back to Bosnia for a minute . You continue to insist that this has to be multilateral action , a criteria that seems to have hamstrung us when it comes to many options thus far and makes it look as if this is a state of paralysis . The United States is the last remaining superpower . Why is it not appropriate in this situation for the United States to act unilaterally ? THE PRESIDENT : Well , the United States -- surely you would agree , that the United States , even as the last remaining superpower , has to act consistent with international law under some mandate of the United Nations . Q But you have a mandate and -- THE PRESIDENT : They do , and that is one of the things that we have under review . I have n't ruled out any option for action . I would remind all of you , I have not ruled out any option , except that we have not discussed and we are not considering the introduction of American forces into continuing hostilities there . We are not . So we are reviewing other options . But I also would remind you that , to be fair , our allies have had -- the French , the British and the Canadians -- have had troops on the ground there . They have been justifiably worried about those . But they have supported the airdrops , the toughening of the sanctions . They welcomed the American delegation now in Europe , working on how to make these sanctions really work and really bite against Serbia . And I can tell you that the other nations involved are also genuinely reassessing their position , and I would not rule out the fact that we can reach an agreement for a concerted action that goes beyond where we have been . I do n't have any criticism of the British , the French and others about that . Q Would that be military action ? Q Mr. President , several of the leading lights in your administration , ranging from your FBI Director to your U.N . Ambassador , to your Deputy Budget Director to your Health Services Secretary , have issued statements in the last couple of weeks which are absolutely contradictory to some of the positions you 've taken in your administration . Why is that ? Are you losing your political grip ? THE PRESIDENT : Give me an example . Q Example ? Judge Sessions said that there was no child abuse in Waco . Madeleine Albright has said in this morning 's newspapers , at least , that she favors air strikes in Bosnia . All of these are things you said that you did n't support . THE PRESIDENT : First of all , I do n't know what -- we know that David Koresh had sex with children . I think that is undisputed , is it not ? Is it not ? Does anybody dispute that ? Where I come from that qualifies as child abuse . And we know that he had people teaching these kids how to kill themselves . I think that qualifies as abuse . And I 'm not criticizing Judge Sessions because I do n't know exactly what he said . In terms of Madeleine Albright , Madeleine Albright has made no public statement at all about air strikes . There is a press report that she wrote me a confidential letter in which she expressed her -- or memo -- in which she expressed her views about the new direction we should take in response to my request to all the senior members of my administration to let me know what they thought we ought to do next . And I have heard from her and from others about what they think we ought to do next . And I 'm not going to discuss the recommendations they made to me , but in the next few days when I make a decision about what to do , then I will announce what I 'm going to do . So I would n't say that either one of those examples qualifies speaking out of school . Q How about the Value Added Tax , Mr. President ? THE PRESIDENT : What was that ? Q The Value Added Tax -- Mrs. Rivlin and Miss Shalala both said that they thought that that was a good idea . THE PRESIDENT : I do n't mind them saying they think it 's a good idea . There are all kinds of arguments for it on policy grounds . That does not mean that we have decided to incorporate it in the health care debate . No decision has been made on that . And I have no objection to their expressing their views on that . We 've had a lot of people from business and labor come to us saying that they thought that tax would help make their particular industries more competitive in the global economy . I took no -- that was n't taking a line against an administration policy . Q Mr. President , a week ago a group of gay and lesbian representatives came out of a meeting with you and expressed in the most ringing terms , their confidence in your understanding of them and their political aspirations , and their belief that you would fulfill those aspirations . Do you feel now that you will be able to meet their now enhanced expectations ? THE PRESIDENT : Well , I do n't know about that . And I do n't know what their -- it depends on what the expectations are . But I 'll tell you this : I believe that this country 's policies should be heavily biased in favor of nondiscrimination . I believe when you tell people they ca n't do certain things in this country that other people can do , there ought to be an overwhelming and compelling reason for it . I believe we need the services of all of our people , and I have said that consistently . And not as a political proposition . The first time this issue came up was in 1991 when I was in Boston . I was just asked the question about it . And I might add -- it 's interesting that I have been attacked -- obviously , those who disagree with me here are primarily coming from the political right in America . When I was Governor , I was attacked from the other direction for sticking up for the rights of religious fundamentalists to run their child care centers and to practice home schooling under appropriate safeguards . I just have always had an almost libertarian view that we should try to protect the rights of American individual citizens to live up to the fullest of their capacities , and I 'm going to stick right with that . Q Are you concerned , sir , that you may have generated expectations on their end and criticism among others that has hamstrung your administration in the sense of far too great emphasis on this issue ? THE PRESIDENT : Yes , but I have not placed a great deal of emphasis on it . It 's gotten a lot of emphasis in other quarters and in the press . I 've just simply taken my position and tried to see it through . And that 's what I do . It does n't take a lot of my time as President to say what I believe in and what I intend to do , and that 's what I 'll continue to do . Q Mr. President , getting back to the situation in Bosnia -- and we understand you have n't made any final decisions on new options previously considered unacceptable . But the two most commonly heard options would be lifting the arms embargo to enable the Bosnian Muslims to defend themselves and to initiate some limited air strikes , perhaps , to cut off supply lines . Without telling us your decision -- presumably , you have n't made any final decisions on those two options -- what are the pros and cons that are going through your mind right now and will weigh heavily on your final decision ? THE PRESIDENT : I 'm reluctant to get into this . There are -- those are two of the options . There are some other options that have been considered . All have pluses and minuses ; all have supporters and opponents within the administration and in the Congress , where , I would remind you , heavy consultations will be required to embark on any new policy . I do believe that on the air strike issue , the pronouncements that General Powell has made generally about military action , apply there . If you take action , if the United States takes action , we must have a clearly-defined objective that can be met . We must be able to understand it and its limitations must be clear . The United States is not , should not , become involved as a partisan in a war . With regard to the lifting of the arms embargo , the question obviously there is if you widen the capacity of people to fight will that help to get a settlement and bring about peace ? Will it lead to more bloodshed ? What kind of reaction can others have that would undermine the effectiveness of the policy ? But I think both of them deserve some serious consideration , along with some other options we have . Q Do you think that these people who are trying to get us into war in Bosnia are really remembering that we have n't taken care of hundreds of thousands of veterans from the last war and we could n't take care of our prisoners and get them all home from Vietnam ? And now many of them are coming up with bills for treatment of Agent Orange . How can we afford to go to any more of these wars ? THE PRESIDENT : Well , I think that 's a good argument against the United States itself becoming involved as a belligerent in a war there . But we are , after all , the world 's only super power . We do have to lead the world and there is a very serious problem of systematic ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia , which could have not only enormous further humanitarian consequences -- and goodness knows there have been many -- but also could have other practical consequences in other nearby regions where the same sorts of ethnic tensions exist . Q Did you make any kind of agreement with Boris Yeltsin to hold off either on air strikes or any kind of aggressive action against the Serbs until after Sunday ? And in general , how has his political situation affected your deliberation on Bosnia ? THE PRESIDENT : No , I have not made any agreement , and he did not ask for that . We never even discussed that , interestingly enough . The Russians , I would remind you , in the middle of President Yeltsin 's campaign , abstained from our attempt to get tougher sanctions through the United Nations in what I thought was the proper decision for them and one that the United States and , I 'm sure , the rest of the free world very much appreciated . Q Do you wish , Mr. President , that you 'd become more involved in the planning of the Waco operation ? And how would you handle that situation differently now ? THE PRESIDENT : I do n't think as a practical matter that the President should become involved in the planning of those kinds of things at that detail . One of the things that I 'm sure will come out when we look into this is -- the questions will be asked and answered , did all of us who up the line of command ask the questions we should have asked and get the answers we should have gotten ? And I look forward to that . But at the time , I have to say , as I did before , the first thing I did after the ATF agents were killed , once we knew that the FBI was going to go in , was to ask that the military be consulted because of the quasi , as least , military nature of the conflict given the resources that Koresh had in his compound and their obvious willingness to use them . And then on the day before the action , I asked the questions of the Attorney General which I have reported to you previously , and which at the time I thought were sufficient . I have -- as I said , I 'm sure -- I leave it to others to make the suggestions about whether there are other questions I should have asked . Q Mr. President , what is your assessment of Director Sessions ' role in the Waco affair ? And have you made a decision on his future ? And if you have n't , will you give him a personal hearing before you do decide ? THE PRESIDENT : Well , first of all , I have no assessment of his role since I had no direct contact with him . And I mean no negative or positive inference . I have no assessment there . I stand by what I said before about my general high regard for the FBI . And I 'm waiting for a recommendation from the Attorney General about what to do with the direction of the FBI . Q Mr. President , since you said that one side in Bosnia conflict represents inhumanity that the Holocaust carried to the nth degree , why do you then tell us that the United States can not take a partisan view in this war ? THE PRESIDENT : Well , I said that the principle of ethnic cleansing is something we ought to stand up against . That does not mean that the United States or the United Nations can enter a war , in effect , to redraw the lines , geographical lines of republics within what was Yugoslavia , or that that would ultimately be successful . I think what the United States has to do is to try to figure out whether there is some way consistent with forcing the people to resolve their own difficulties we can stand up to and stop ethnic cleansing . And that is obviously the difficulty we are wrestling with . This is clearly the most difficult foreign policy problem we face , and that all of our allies face . And if it were easy , I suppose it would have been solved before . We have tried to do more in the last 90 days than was previously done . It has clearly not been enough to stop the Serbian aggression , and we are now looking at what else we can do . Q Yesterday you specifically criticized the Roosevelt administration for not having bombed the railroads to the concentration camps and things that were near military targets . Are n't there steps like that that would not involve conflict -- direct conflict or partisan belligerence that you might consider ? THE PRESIDENT : There may be . I would remind you that the circumstances were somewhat different . We were then at war with Germany at the time and that 's what made that whole incident so -- series of incidents -- so perplexing . But we have -- as I say , we 've got all of our options under review . Q The diplomatic initiative on Haiti is on the verge of collapse . What can you do to salvage it short of a full-scale military operation ? THE PRESIDENT : Well , you may know something I do n't . That 's not what our people tell me . I think Mr. Caputo and Ambassador Pezzullo have done together a good job . The thing keeps going back and forth because of the people who are involved with the de facto government there . It 's obvious what their concerns are . They were the same concerns that led to the ouster of Aristide in the first place , and President Aristide , we feel , should be restored to power . We 're working toward that . I get a report on that -- we discuss it at least three times a week , and I 'm convinced that we 're going to prevail there and be successful . I do believe that there 's every reason to think that there will have to be some sort of multilateral presence to try to guarantee the security and the freedom from violence of people on both sides of the ledger while we try to establish the conditions of ongoing civilized society . But I believe we 're going to prevail there . Q Mr. President , would you care to make your assessment of the first 100 days before we make one for you ? ( Laughter . ) THE PRESIDENT : Well , I 'll say if -- I believe , first of all , we passed the budget resolution in record time . That was the biggest issue . That confirmed the direction of the administration and confirmed the commitments of the campaign that we could both bring the deficit down and increase investment , and that we could do it by specific spending cuts and by raising taxes , almost all of which come from the highest income people in this society -- reversing a 12-year trend in which most of the tax burdens were borne by the middle class , whose incomes were going down when their taxes were going up , while the deficit went from $ 1 trillion to $ 4 trillion , the total national debt , and the deficit continued to go up . We have a 20-year low in interest rates from mortgages . We have lower interest rates across the board . We have tens of billions of dollars flooding back into this economy as people refinance their debt . We have established a new environmental policy , which is dramatically different . The Secretary of Education has worked with me and with others and with the governors to establish a new approach in education that focuses on tough standards , as well as increasing opportunity . We have done an enormous amount of work on political reform , on campaign finance and lobbying reform . And I have imposed tough ethics requirements on my own administration 's officials . These things are consistent with not only what I said I 'd do in the campaign , but with turning the country around . The Vice President is heading a task force which will literally change the way the federal government operates and make it much more responsive to the citizens of this country . We are working on a whole range of other things . The welfare reform initiative , to move people from welfare to work . And , of course , a massive amount of work has been done on the health care issue , which is a huge economic and personal security problem for millions of Americans . So I think it is amazing how much has been done . More will be done . We also passed the Family Leave bill . A version of the motor voter bill -- that has not come out of conference back to me yet . And everything has been passed except the stimulus program . So I think we 're doing fine and we 're moving in the right direction . I feel good about it . Q Sir , a follow-up . Would n't you say , though , that one of your biggest initiatives , aid to Soviet Russia , is now practically finished -- if we ca n't pass a stimulus bill in our own country , how can we do it for them ? THE PRESIDENT : Let me recast the question a little bit . It 's a good question -- ( laughter ) -- it 's a good question , but to be fair we 've got to recast it . We have already -- the first round of aid to the Soviet -- to non-Soviet Russia , to a democratic Russia , is plainly going to go through , the first $ 1.6 billion . The aid that we agreed with our partners in the G-7 to provide through the international financial institutions , which is a big dollar item , is plainly going to go through . The question is , can we get any more aid for Russia that requires a new appropriation by the United States Congress ? And that is a question I think , Mary , that will be resolved in the weeks ahead , in part by what happens to the American workers and their jobs and their future . I think the two things will be tied by many members of Congress . Q The tailhook report came out this morning , documenting horrendous and nearly-criminal conduct on the part of the Navy . How much did you discuss the incident and what might be done about it with your nominee to be the Secretary of the Navy ? THE PRESIDENT : First , let me comment a little on that . The Inspector General 's report details conduct which is wrong and which has no place in the armed services . And I expect the report to be acted on in the appropriate way . I also want to say to the American people and to all of you that the report should be taken for what it is , a very disturbing list of allegations which will have to be thoroughly examined . It should not be taken as a general indictment of the United States Navy or of all the fine people who serve there . It is very specific in its allegations , and it will be pursued . The only thing I said to the Secretary-Designate of the Navy and the only thing I should have said to him , I think , is that I expected him to take the report and to do his duty . And I believe he will do that . Q Mr. President , to back to Russia for just a minute . The latest poll show that Mr. Yeltsin will probably win his vote of confidence . But there seems to be a real toss-up on whether or not voters are going to endorse his economic reforms . THE PRESIDENT : I understand that . Q Can you live with a split -- ( laughter ) -- can you live with a split decision , though , or do you need both passed in order to then build support for Russian aid ? THE PRESIDENT : I believe -- the answer to your question is , for the United States , the key question should be that which is posed to any democracy , which is who wins the election . If he wins the election , if he is ratified by the Russian people to continue as their President , then I think we should do our best to work with him toward reform . You know , we had a lot of other countries here for the Holocaust Museum dedication -- their leaders were here . Leaders from Eastern Europe , leaders from at least one republic of the former Soviet Union ; all of them having terrible economic challenges as they convert from a communist command and control economy to a market economy in a world where there 's economic slowdown everywhere . And in a world in which there 's economic slowdown and difficulty , all leaders will have trouble having their policies be popular in a poll because they have n't produced the results that the people so earnestly yearn for . You can understand that . But if they have confidence in the leadership , I think that 's all we can ask . And the United States will -- if the Russian people ratify him as their President and stick with him then the United States will continue to work with him . I think he is a genuine democrat -- small d -- and genuinely committed to reform . I think that we should support that . Q Mr. President , Mr. Perot has come out strongly in what is perceived behind the line against a free trade agreement -- NAFTA . How hard are you going to fight for this free trade agreement and when do you expect to see it accomplished ? THE PRESIDENT : I think we 'll have the agreement ready in the fairly near future . You know , our people are still working with the Mexican government and with the Canadians on the side agreements . We 're trying to work out what the environmental agreement will say , what the labor agreement will say , and then what the fairest way to deal with enforcement is . The Mexicans say , and there is some merit to their position , that they 're worried about transferring their sovereignty in enforcement to a multilateral commission . Even in the United States , to be fair , we have some folks who are worried about that -- about giving that up . On the other hand , if we 're going to have an environmental agreement and a labor standards agreement that means something , then there has to be ultimately some consequences for violating them . So what we 're trying to do is to agree on an approach which would say that if there is a pattern of violations -- if you keep on violating it past a certain point -- maybe not an isolated incident , but a pattern of violation -- there is going to be some enforcement . There must be consequences . And we 're working out the details of that . But I still feel quite good about it . And this is just an area where I disagree with Mr. Perot and with others . I think that we will win big if we have a fair agreement that integrates more closely the Mexican economy and the American economy and leads us from there to Chile to other market economies in Latin America , and gives us a bigger world in which to trade . I think that 's the only way a rich country can grow richer . If you look at what Japan and other countries in the Pacific are doing to reach out in their own region , it 's a pretty good lesson to us that we had better worry about how to build those bridges in our own area . So this is an idea battle . You know , you 've got a lot of questions and I want to answer them all , but let me say not every one of these things can be distilled simply into politics -- you know , who 's for this and who 's for that , and if this person is for this , somebody else has got to be for that . A lot of these things honestly involved real debates over ideas , over who 's right and wrong about the world toward which we 're moving . And the answers are not self-evident . And one of the reasons that I wanted to run for President is I wanted to sort of open the floodgates for debating these ideas so that we could try to change in the appropriate way . So I just have a difference of opinion . I believe that the concept of NAFTA is sound , even though , as you know , I thought that the details needed to be improved . Q Mr. President , there was a tremendous flurry of interest earlier this month in the Russian document that purported to show that the Vietnamese had held back American prisoners . General Vessey has now said publicly that while the document itself was authentic , he believes that it was incorrect . Do you have a personal view at this point about that issue ? And more broadly , do you believe that , in fact , the Vietnamese did return all the American prisoners at the time of the Paris Peace Accord ? THE PRESIDENT : First let me say , I saw General Vessey before he went to Vietnam and after he returned . And I have a high regard for him and I appreciate his willingness to serve his country in this way . As to whether the document had any basis in fact , let me say that the government of Vietnam was more forthcoming than it had been in the past and gave us some documents that would tend to undermine the validity of the Russian documents claim . I do not know whether that is right or wrong . We are having it basically evaluated at this time , and when we complete the evaluation , we 'll tell you . And , of course , we want to tell the families of those who were missing in action or who were POWs . I think that we 'll be able to make some progress in eliminating some of the questions about the outstanding cases as a result of this last interchange , but I can not say that I 'm fully satisfied that we know all that we need to know . There are still some cases that we do n't know the answer to . But I do believe we 're making some progress . I was encouraged by the last trip . Q I 'd like to follow up on that . Before the U.S. normalizes relations , allows trade to go forward , do you have to be personally sure that every case has been resolved or would you be willing to go forward on the basis that while it may take years to resolve these cases , the Vietnamese have made sufficient offerings to us to confirm good faith ? THE PRESIDENT : A lot of experts say you can never resolve every case , every one , that we could n't resolve all the cases for them and that there are still some cases that have not been factually resolved , going back to the Second World War . But what I would have to be convinced of is that we had gone a long way toward resolving every case that could be resolved at this moment in time , and that there was a complete , open and unrestricted commitment to continue to do everything that could be done always to keep resolving those cases . And we 're not there yet . Again , I have to be guided a little bit by people who know a lot about this . And I confess to being much more heavily influenced by the families of the people whose lives were lost there , or whose lives remain in question than by the commercial interest and the other things which seem so compelling in this moment . I just am very influenced by how the families feel . Q your economic stimulus package , are you doing some kind of reality check now and scaling back some of your plans , your legislative plans for the coming year , including the crime bill , the health care initiative and other things ? Are there any plans to do that ? And also , did you underestimate the power of Senator Bob Dole ? THE PRESIDENT : No , what I underestimated was the extent to which what I thought was a fairly self-evident case , particularly after we stayed below the spending caps approved by this Congress , including the Republicans who were in this Congress last year -- when we had already passed a budget resolution which called for over $ 500 billion in deficit reduction . When they had voted repeatedly for supplemental appropriations to help foreign governments , I thought at least four of them would vote to break cloture , and I underestimated that . I did not have an adequate strategy of dealing with that . I also thought that if I made a good-faith effort to negotiate and to compromise , that it would not be rebuffed . Instead , every time I offered something they reduced the offer that they had previously been talking to the Majority Leader about . So it was a strange set of events . But I think what happened was what was a significant part of our plan , but not the major part of it , acquired a political connotation that got out of proportion to the merits , so that a lot of Republicans were saying to me privately , `` Mr. President , I 'd like to be for this , but I ca n't now . And we 're all strung out and we 're divided . '' And I think we need to do a reality check . As I said , what I want to know -- let me go back to what I said -- what I want to know from our folks and from our friends in the Senate on -- and Republicans or Democrats -- is what could I have done differently to make it come out differently . Because the real losers here were not the President and the administration . The real losers were the hundreds of thousands of people who wo n't have jobs now . We could have put another 700,000 kids to work this summer . I mean , we could have done a lot of good things with that money . And I think that is very , very sad . And it became more political than it should have . But the underlying rationale I do n't think holds a lot of water -- that it was deficit spending . That just wo n't wash. Q and redo -- THE PRESIDENT : No . I mean , you know , for example -- you mentioned the crime bill . I think it would be a real mistake not to pass the crime bill . I mean , the crime bill was almost on the point of passage last year . And they were all fighting over the Brady Bill . Surely , surely after what we have been through in this country just in the last three months , with the kind of mindless violence we have seen , we can pass a bill requiring people to go through a waiting period before they buy a handgun . And surely we can see that we need more police officers on the street . That 's another thing that -- I really believe that once we move some of that money -- not all , but some of it up into this jobs package to make some of the jobs rehiring police officers on the street who 'd been laid off , that would be a compelling case . I mean people are scared in this country and I think we need to go forward . I feel very strongly that we need to go forward on the crime bill . Q Mr. President , back to the tailhook report for a second . That report contained very strong criticism of the Navy 's senior leadership in general , but did not name any of the senior officers . Do you believe that the senior officers who are implicated in this , including Admiral Kelso who was there one night in Las Vegas , should they be disciplined and do you believe the public has a right to know the names of the senior officers ? THE PRESIDENT : You should know that under the rules of law which apply to this , I am in the chain of command . There is now an Inspector General 's report and the law must take its course . If I were to answer that question I might prejudice any decisions which might be later made in this case . I do n't really think -- I think all I can tell you is what I have already said . I was very disturbed by the specific allegations in the Inspector General 's report , and I want appropriate action to be taken . Until the proper procedures have a chance to kick in and appropriate action is taken , I have been advised that because I am the Commander-in-Chief I have to be very careful about what I say so as not to prejudice the rights of anybody against whom any action might proceed or to prejudice the case in any other way either pro or con . So I ca n't say any more except to say that I want this thing handled in an appropriate and thorough way . Q Mr. President , could I ask you for a clarification on Bosnia ? You said that you were not considering introduction of American forces . Does that include any air forces as well as ground forces , sir ? THE PRESIDENT : I said ground forces . Q You said ground forces . Could I ask you , sir , if you fear that using U.S. air strikes might draw the United States into a ground war there ? THE PRESIDENT : I just do n't want to discuss our evaluation of the options anymore . I 've told you that there 's never been a serious discussion in this country about the introduction of ground forces into an ongoing conflict there . Q With hundreds of thousands of gays in Washington this weekend for the march , did you ever reconsider your decision to leave town for this weekend ? Did you ever consider in any way participating in some of the activities ? THE PRESIDENT : No . Q Why not ? THE PRESIDENT : Because I -- and , basically , I would n't participate in other marches . I think once you become President , on balance , except under unusual circumstances , that is not what should be done . But more importantly , I 'm going to the American Society of Newspaper Editors , a trip that presumably most of you would want me to make , to try to focus anew on what I think are the fundamental issues at stake for our country right now . And I expect that I will say something about the fact that a lot of Americans have come here , asking for a climate that is free of discrimination ; asking , basically , to be able to work hard and live by the rules and be treated like other American citizens if they do that , and just that . And that 's always been my position -- not only for the gays who will be here , but for others as well . Thank you very much . END1:48 P.M. EDT

Correct me if I am mistaken , but I *think* you are asking me if I still believe that we should uphold all of the Laws pertaining to capital punishment for such things as adultery , rape and other heinous crimes . As you may recall , Jesus was confronted by this same question in regards to the adultress who was caught in the act and brought before Jesus . And His reply , `` Let he who is without sin cast the first stone . '' Jesus does not deny the sentence that is to due for this violation of the Law .

If one is to use the Bible as a reference , one must always be open to different interpretations . As a Christian , I have the Spirit of God to verify what I believe in the Word .

If you choose to jump off a cliff , you can hardly blame God for you going *splat* at the bottom . He knows that if you choose to jump , that you will die but He will not prevent you from making that choice . In fact , He sent His Son to stand on the edge of the cliff and tell everyone of what lies below . To prove that point , Jesus took that plunge Himself but He being God was able to rise up again . I have seen the example of Christ and have chosen not to jump and I 'm trying to tell you not to jump or else you 'll go *splat* .

Did your style start feeling a > bit cramped ? Yes , that 's exactly what I felt . My heart just felt that what I was being taught was *wrong* -- a basically good message , but framed in errors . I could not with a clear conscience accept that women were somehow not equal to men , that homosexuals are `` guilty '' of their lifestyle , that pride in one 's work is a bad thing , that Jesus died for me -- I do n't want ANYBODY to die for me , especially as an impersonal act where the person ca n't possibly even *know* me well enough to really know if I 'm worth dying for or not . I was never able to accept the bit about Jesus 's death being a good thing . If that means that I 'm just not comprehending a basic message of Christianity , then so be it . Maybe I 'm just not compatible with Christianity . I just refuse to follow rules blindly , and since I ca n't even convince myself that your god even EXISTS in the way you describe it , I 've got to just follow my own conscience in these matters . > I know how that goes . Knowing I could n't and did n't want to > live up to those impossibleand rather incovenient rules are what kept me > outside , too . Do n't think that my morals are shoddy or nonexistent just because I do n't believe in your god . I will not steal , and I will not murder -- not because I fear divine repudiation , but because these just *aren't* in my character . You may think there 's nothing keeping me from just running around on a murdering spree , stealing things when I 'm able , insulting people for the heck of it , because I 'm not answerable to anyone ; but you 'd be wrong . I 'm answerable to myself . A life like that would be a cheap life ; I happen to want to earn respect in myself . > 'Till I met the Man , that is . My initial break with Christianity came after a lot of soul-searching and a lot of wondering why I could no longer feel the 'presence ' of God with me . I finally decided that I had once `` felt '' this presence just as I had `` felt '' my mighty teddy bear beside me when I was a little tyke , protecting me from the monsters under the bed -- that I had believed in God just as I had believed in the teddy bear , as something of an emotional crutch to protect me from perceived dangers . Since then , I 've never abandoned the possibility that maybe your supernatural trinity does exist . But there are a few times when , in my darkened room by my bed , I have set aside everything I believe for a moment and called out to whatever 's out there , because I want to know the truth even if it means abandoning everything I know . And I have not yet received an answer . > = Only when I truly listened to myself , body and soul , did I realize > = that I could no longer honestly keep up the charade of being > = Christian . There is a higher truth in the universe , and Christianity > = just ai n't it . > > Any suggestions on what ( or who or where ) it might be , and why ? Nope . It may well be unknowable . Scientists have suggested that the universe may be finite and wrap around on itself ( the three-dimensional universe may be mapped onto a four-dimensional supersphere in the same way you can map a two-dimensional plane onto a three-dimensional sphere ; see _Sphereland_ , the sequel to _Flatland_ , for more thoughts on this ) . Our entire universe might just be an electron in a four- dimensional universe , which in turn may only be an insignificant speck in a universe above that , and so on and so forth until the variables become too much for us to even speculate on . That is , there 's no possible way for us to know exactly how we came to be , so there 's no reason at all to believe that your God exists nor had anything to do with it . > '' OK , '' you may say . `` So now , if I 'm just being good , am I doing good enough ?

We can present what we 've seen and > experienced ( providing our witness ) , but it is n't up to us to make that seed > sprout . Christians have provided me with nothing except quotes from your holy book , and all sorts of tactics to try to get me to believe : guilt trips , insinuations that I 'm without morals , arguments from disbelief ( `` how can you possibly believe that God *doesn't* exist ? `` ) , and so forth . All I 'm asking is for you to convince me . I want to be convinced , but it 's not going to be easy . > So much as you do n't like what we 're `` selling '' , there just may be someone > out there that can identify with it . Methinks you could give us all a > lesson in tolerance and back off . Having had years upon years of contact with your religion from both the inside and the outside , I view it as harmful in many ways . It preys on people who want to find meaning in their lives , and once it's got these people , it teaches them to have pity ( and sometimes starkly intolerant ) of others who do not share these views . Maybe you 'll say that your religion does n't teach that -- but I 've got to judge Christianity from the Christians I know . I feel that it is entirely possible and good to have faith in one's self , and to be a positive influence on society for no better reason than that . So I hope that my words in this newsgroup will at least make some people think . I want Christians to realize that there are perfectly valid lifestyles and opinions that have nothing to do with their deity whatsoever , and I want people who are considering Christianity to realize that Christianity does not hold the sole key to a happy , fulfilled life . I have known some very nice Christians who have done some very nice things . I think what sets these people apart from the general masses is that they recognize that their religious beliefs may be wrong , and they know the weaknesses of their religion , yet they still decide to believe , but they keep their beliefs to themselves and do not think any less of people who do n't agree with them . > Obviously , the debate on the veracity and reliability of the Source of the > Christian 's faith is far from conclusive , notwithstanding how vehemently we > propose otherwise .

OK , here 's my results so far ... . 1 : You have to define the monitor as LCD - it does n't really support Analogue video input ( It works , but is n't very linear ... ) 2 : The incoming sync pulses need inverting . This is best achieved with either a cmos XOR package or a transistor inverter . If you do n't know how to do it , do n't even contemplate it.. : - ) 3 : It 'll only work in standard VGA mode . OK , having said that , I 'm trying to either find a circuit or IC which will act as a universal sync decoder . I want somethikng which basically only detects the leading sync pulse edge , and does n't care about the polarity , outputting the -ve going pulses that the atari monitor requires . There are 2 reasons for doing this 1 : VGA cards change their sync polarity depending which mode they're in - herc emulation is + , - while MVGA is + , + for example . 2 : It means I do n't have to put a toggle switch on the back of the monitor in order to be able to run it off both the atari and my IBM . Currently I have 3 ( Yes , 3 ! ) monitors sitting on my desk , and I want to get that number down as much as possible . Being able to use the atari monitor as a paper-white VGA will cut things down to 2 . If I forget about Atari colour , I can get down to 1 . Ultimately , the best course of action is to get a multisync monitor , but I 'm as pressed for cash as anyone else , so it 'll have to wait ... -- Alan Brown dogbowl @ dogbox.acme.gen.nz

From : Ronald Bleier < rbleier @ igc.apc.org > Subject : Reflections on Bosnia/Owen , Neier , Nf-ID : # N : cdp:1483500384:000:9465 Nf-From : cdp.UUCP ! rbleier May 15 10:30:00 1993 Lines : 187 REFLECTIONS ON BOSNIA LORD OWEN AND THE SERBS In early February '93 , Lord Owen made appearances in New York City on the Donahue and Charlie Rose shows . On a couple of occasions on those shows Lord Owen gave away his pro-Serbian position when he made the point that much or most of the Bosnian territory then in dispute or already overrun by Serbian forces had been controlled and occupied by Serbs before WWII . It was as if he were saying that since the Serbs had previously occupied those territories and lost them during the Hitler years , they should be allowed to reconquer them today . I was familiar with this view because my father , a Yugoslav Jew who escaped to this country during the war , was aided and found sympathy among the Serbs during those harrowing years . In recent months when the subject of Serbian aggression was mentioned , my father would make the point that 850,000 Serbs were killed by Nazi and pro-Nazi Croatian forces known as the Ustasha . My father is so pro-Serbian that he dismissed reports of Serbian atrocities . My father also excoriated New York Times columnist Anthony Lewis , because , my father said , Anthony Lewis `` is always talking about the Muslims . '' Update -- April 28 , 1993 After an uneasy truce in and around Sbernica , shelling has resumed in nearby areas by all sides and the killing and the misery continues apace while the Clinton administration dithers its response . In the days leading to the collapse of resistance at Sbernica , Lord Owen changed his tune . Previously he had opposed military intervention on the grounds that it would endanger U.N. relief workers . When Serbian forces began to march on Sbernica , the threat to U.N. relief soldiers went unmentioned while Lord Owen called for outside intervention to stop Serbian aggression , including the use of air strikes . The current disastrous situation can be seen as a failure of the West and a failure of the Vance-Owen initiative which did nothing to halt the Serbs . Now that it 's too late to save Muslim areas that Lord Owen felt should be in a Muslim state , Lord Owen belatedly calls for strong action . CLINTON AND BOSNIA In the summer of 1992 , George Kenney , a senior State Department official , the undersecretary in charge of the Yugoslav desk , made news when he resigned from the State Department because of the Bush administration 's refusal to take any action to halt Serbian aggression . As Kenney saw it , Bush 's inaction was largely due to the president 's unwillingness to risk any political capital by getting involved there . Apparently the same is true of the Clinton administration . Clinton gives the impression that he cares more than Bush did about the terrible ongoing tragedy , but the practical effect has so far been the same . According to the New York Times , ( 4/16/93 ) the Clinton administration did everything it could to suppress a mid-March report by its own experts which called for military action if necessary to protect `` safe havens '' for the Muslims . At one point , Senate majority leader , George Mitchell was so incensed that the report was kept from Congress , that he called for an investigation . Instead of helping the desperate Bosnians , Clinton has signalled again and again that Milosevic and the Serbs are free to do what they want in Bosnia -- indeed , Clinton and the West have been signalling that the Serbs should get on with the job and finish off the Bosnians as quickly as possible while we turn the other way . A key signal was when Clinton made it clear that he would NOT send in American military forces on the ground . On this issue , Clinton has made me wistful for Bush . Bush and Baker could not have done worse , and might have been pressured to do better well before this time . Lives in Bosnia might have been saved and the destruction might have been curtailed.. The Nation , the left and `` the Bosnian QUANDARY '' Typical of the left 's inability to come to grips with the core issue involved in Bosnia , i.e. , a clear aggressor destroying hundreds of thousands of lives , is the editorial on the `` Bosnian quandary '' in The Nation ( 4/26/93 ) . In the end the editorial votes to do nothing , even while noticing `` the ghastly atrocities of the Bosnian Serbs '' and that the `` greater and lesser powers ... dither and fuss [ and ] hang back . '' ( `` Before anything else happens , the Clinton Administration ought to pay the $ 530 million the United States owes the '' U.N. the editorial concludes . ) In its most striking passage , the editorial writer warns that '' those who are pushing President Clinton to intervene on the side of the Bosnians had better review U.S. foreign policy since World War II . '' The editorial argues for inaction on the basis that the Bosnian Serbs are no worse than any number of U.S. clients including the Chileans , the South Africans , the Greek fascists and others . ( In a subsequent column for The Nation , Christopher Hitchens correctly called this editorial , `` contemptible . '' ) *** William Pfaff , a European based journalist who writes for the The New Yorker and the Los Angeles Times , is among a group of liberal columnists like Anthony Lewis , and Leslie Gelb who have clearly and consistently called for strong Western and American intervention to stop the Serbs . Pfaff 's most recent column ( Liberal Opinion Week 4/19/93 ) is entitled `` International Cowardice Worsened Bosnian Tragedy . '' He clarifies the international failure which has led to present situation in one sentence . `` Having refused to intervene to sanction the threat to minority rights in newly independent Croatia in June 1991 , or to block or penalize the military aggression by Serbia that immediately followed , and the atrocious '' ethnic cleansing '' which followed that , the United Nations now contemplates deploying in Bosnia military force on a scale which two years ago could have deterred the horrors Yugoslavia has since experienced . '' He goes on to explain that U.N. plans now envisaged call for a `` more daunting and open-ended military assignment than a direct military intervention to halt the aggression would have been a year ago . '' Aryeh Neier on the Serbs In his `` Watching Rights '' column in the The Nation ( 5/3/93 ) Aryeh Neier gets to the heart of the motivation of the `` aggressors '' -- the preferred term for the Serbian forces who have been besieging and shelling Sarajevo for more than a year . He explains that `` there is no military purpose that is served by the destruction of its fabric and its people ... Above all , few of those aligned with the forces attacking Sarajevo would want to live there even if the city could be rebuilt . They are not city people . `` It is this , I believe -- aside from a desire to break the morale of Bosnians and make them press their government to accept peace at any price -- that explains the conduct of the siege of Sarajevo ... [ I ] t is a loathing for all that is urban , pluralist and cosmopolitan that has made Sarajevo the object for devastation . `` Historically , most of the Serbian population in Bosnia and Herzegovina has been rural , while Muslims , who were the civil servants and intelligentsia during the centuries of Ottoman rule , made up a disproportionate share of the urban population ... .The destruction of Sarajevo is not only an expression of hostility against this city ; it is also an attack on the urban idea ... .The demagogues who whipped up the passions let loose by this war exploited not only ethnic and religious bigotry but also hatred for all that is cosmopolitan . '' The light that Neier sheds on the issue helps to clarify what is at stake . The Serbs represent the know-nothing , anti-secularist , fundamentalist , fascist forces who are attacking the urban , cosmopolitan , secular , multi-cultural idea . They are attacking the rest of us , just as Hitler did . One irony is that at the beginning of the crisis over Bosnia , it was for awhile maintained by the Serbs and their supporters that they were responding to a threat by the Bosnian Muslims to create a fundamentalist state . Neier has shown that it is the Serbs who are the great threat to secularism , multi-culturalism , diversity and democracy . It 's the Serbs who are attacking the democratic notion , the democratic idea . Anthony Lewis comes close to the point when he asks why does respect for Clinton 's presidency `` depend ... on his acting effectively against Serbian aggression ? ... First of all because to do nothing about genocide would be such a betrayal of the values we and our allies profess . '' ( Times , 4/26/93 ) But it 's not merely a betrayal of our values . It 's because the Serbs are attacking us by proxy , just as Hitler was . One argument for decisive action by the West that is heard in a different form , is that war in the Balkans is destablizing for Europe . We hear it as , the Bosnians are Europe 's Palestinians ; that is to say , just as the Palestinian refugee problem has been the key to instability in the Middle East , just so will the hundreds of thousands of Yugoslav refugees of all ethnicities result in turmoil in Europe for decades to come . One of the lessons of the twentieth century is that even though the Atlantic Ocean divides us , the Americas are ultimately tied to the destiny of Europe . If Europe is destabilized , the U.S. will inevitably be affected and drawn into its problems . As in a whirlpool , sooner or later we will be drawn into the maelstrom . And as past history and Pfaff have shown , it 's much better if we do so decisively , quickly and on our terms . Sincerely , Ronald Bleier

'' > Events of the crucifiction Matthew says that the veil of the temple was rent , that there was an earthquake , and that it was dark from the sixth to the ninth hour , that graves opened and bodies of the saints arose and went into Jeruselem , appearing to many ( beating Jesus to the resurection ) . Mark and Luke speak of darkness and the veil of the temple being rent but mention no earthquake or risen saints . John is the only one who mentions Jesus 's side being peirced . > Burial of Jesus Matthew says the Jews asked Pilate for a guard to prevent the body from being stolen by the disciples , and for the tomb to be sealed . All of this was supposedly done , but the other gospels do not mention these precautions . > How long was Jesus in the tomb ? Depends where you look ; Matthew 12:40 gives Jesus prophesying that he will spend `` three days and three nights in the heart of the earth '' , and Mark 10:34 has `` after three days ( meta treis emeras ) he will rise again '' . As far as I can see from a quick look , the prophecies have `` after three days '' , but the post-resurrection narratives have `` on the third day '' . > Time of the Resurection Matthew says Sunday at dawn , Mark says the sun was rising , and John says it was dark . > Who was at the Empty Tomb ? Is it : MAT 28:1 In the end of the sabbath , as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week , came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre . MAR 16:1 And when the sabbath was past , Mary Magdalene , and Mary the mother of James , and Salome , had bought sweet spices , that they might come and anoint him . JOH 20:1 The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early , when it was yet dark , unto the sepulchre , and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre . > Whom did they see at the tomb ? MAT 28:2 And , behold , there was a great earthquake : for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven , and came and rolled back the stone from the door , and sat upon it . MAT 28:3 His countenance was like lightning , and his raiment white as snow : MAT 28:4 And for fear of him the keepers did shake , and became as dead men . MAT 28:5 And the angel answered and said unto the women , Fear not ye : for I know that ye seek Jesus , which was crucified . MAR 16:5 And entering into the sepulchre , they saw a young man sitting on the right side , clothed in a long white garment ; and they were affrighted . LUK 24:4 And it came to pass , as they were much perplexed thereabout , behold , two men stood by them in shining garments : JOH 20:12 And seeth two angels in white sitting , the one at the head , and the other at the feet , where the body of Jesus had lain . > Belief that the disciples stole Jesus 's body Matthew says the guard was paid to tell this story , but no other gospel makes this claim . > Appearences of the risen Jesus Matthew says an angel at the tomb told the two Marys and that Jesus also told them , to tell the disciples to meet him in Galilee . The disciples then went to a mountain previously agreed opon , and met Jesus there . This was his only appearance , except to the women at the tomb . Matthew only devotes five verses to the visit with the disciples . Mark says that Jesus walked with two of the disciples in the country , and that they told the rest of the disciples , who refused to believe . Later he appeared to the 11 disciples at mealtime . Luke says two followers went , the same day that Jesus rose from the dead , to Emmaus , a village eight miles from Jeruselem , and there Jesus jioned them but was unrecognised . While they ate a meal together that evening , they finally recognised Jesus , whereopon he dissapeared . Returning at once to Jeruselem , they told the disciples of their experience , and suddenly Jesus appeared among them , frightening them , as they thought he was a spirit . Jesus then ate some fish and honey and then preached to them . John says Jesus appeared to the disciples the evening of the day he arrose , in Jeruselem , where they were hiding . He breathed the Holy Ghost opon them , but Thomas was not present and refused to believe . Eight days later Jesus joined the disciples again at the same place and this time he convinced Thomas . Once more Jesus made an appearance to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias but again was not recognised . After telling them to cast their netson the other side of the boat , Jesus becomes known to them and prepares bread and fish for them . They all eat together and converse . The book of acts further adds to the confusion . It says that Jesus showed himself to the apostles for a period of 40 days after his resurection ( thus contradicting Matthew , Mark , Luke AND John ) and spoke to them of things pertaining to the kingdom of God : `` And when he had spoken these things , while they beheld , he was taken up ; and a cloud recieved him out of their sight . And while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up , two men stood by them in white apparel : Which also said , Ye men of Galilee , why stand ye gazing into heaven ? This same Jesus , which is taken from you into heaven , shall so comein like manneras ye have seen him go into heaven '' Acts 1:3-11 Paul outdoes every other `` authority '' by saying that Jesus was seen by 500 persons between the time of the resurection and the assension , although he does not say where . He also claims that he himself `` as one born out of due time '' also saw Jesus . 1 Cor 15:6-8 . > The Ascension Matthew says nothing about it . Mark casually says that Jesus was recieved into heaven after he was finished talking with the disciples in Jeruselem . Luke says Jesus led the desciples to Bethany and that while he blessed them , he was parted from them and carried up into heaven . John says nothing about it . Acts contradicts all of the above . ( See previous section ) > When second coming ? MAT 24:34 Verily I say unto you , This generation shall not pass , till all these things be fulfilled . MAR 13:30 Verily I say unto you , that this generation shall not pass , till all these things be done . LUK 21:32 Verily I say unto you , This generation shall not pass away , till all be fulfilled . 1 thessalonians 4:15-18 > How many apostles were in office between the resurection and ascention 1 Corinthians 15:5 ( 12 ) Matthew 27:3-5 ( minus one from 12 ) Acts 1:9-26 ( Mathias not elected until after resurrection ) MAT 28:16 Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee , into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them . > ascend to heaven '' And Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven . '' ( 2 Kings 2:11 ) '' No man hath ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven , ... the Son of Man . '' ( John 3:13 ) As you can see , there are a number of contradictions in the account of the trial , crucifiction and resurection of Jesus . If these are good witnesses , you would think that they could get SOME of these important details right ! ( In fact , I can not find very many points on where they AGREE . You would think that they could at least agree on some of the points they were supposedly observing ! ) Because of the fact that there is so much contradiction and error , the story of the resurection as presented can not be taken as literal truth . ( Due to the nature of the story , I doubt if it should be taken as ANY sort of truth . ) Alan

Gee , I have many interesting and enlightening anecdotes about myself , my friends , and my family , but in the practice of medicine I expect and demand more rigorous rationales for basing therapy than `` Aunt Susie 's brother-in-law ... '' . Anecdotal evidence may provide inspiration for a hypothesis , but rarely proves anything in a positive sense . And unlike mathematics , boolean logic rarely applies directly to medical issues , and so evidence of 'exceptions ' does not usually disprove but rather modifies current concepts of disease . > So , if you have any evidence *against* the hypothesis -- - for example , > controlled double-blind studies showing that the anti-fungals do n't do any > better than sugar water -- - then let 's hear it .

One possible reason is that file ' is made with sassafras leaves , while root beer was made with sassafras bark or root bark . The leaves contain either no or less saffrole than the bark . There is also some sort of treatment which putatively removes saffrole from sassafras products .

Is this true ? Well , the last time that I went to the store to buy sassafras bark to make root beer , there was a sign saying that it was n't sold for human consumption . Also , when I asked the person if they had wild cherry bark and wintergreen bark , she made a point of telling me that I could n't buy sassafras for human consumption .

Or just that > this is a lesser right to FOA ? Good question . It just depends . How 's that for an answer ? : - ) Seriously , I believe that it depends on wether or not you are talking about a governmental employer or not . In this case , I believe that there should be absolutely no discrimination , direct or indirect , period . I feel this way not because it would offend my moral sensibilities ( which it of course would ) , but because the government is a coercive entity which we can not escape . It boggles my mind that in my lifetime , there were '' whites only '' drinking fountains in some parks , but no fountains for others , yet the taxes garnished to support those fountains certainly were not applied to `` whites only . '' In essence , we can not escape the coercive state . Even Randy Weavers have to pay property tax . On the other hand , private employers are not a monopoly , and their businesses should be run by them , and not by the government , unless they elect to turn their affairs over to that government . # > Why ?

I have a lot of interaction ( all positive ) with my tenants , so I guess that that is n't an issue . But say I were to buy a unit in another town , and have it managed by a third party . Let 's say that I have a real aversion to Christians because of the stuff that they buy into hook line and sinker , and because of the lunatic schmucks that they try to get elected . I do n't want any of those fish symbols hanging in the window of a house that I own . Should the government intervene ? If I was Elie Weizel and the only rental applicant was Tom Metzger , should I be forced to rent this distant unit to him ? # > The companies on the Fortune 500 , for example , are all privately owned .

Yes , and the neat thing about this is that unlike the mom & pop store , you and I can buy shares in IBM , and have influence over their decision making policies if we do n't like them .

I have been having problems with a slightly different clutch problem on my 90 Prelude . See rec.autos.tech for more detail . My problem is a false engagement point below the actual one . It also seems affected by weather - it is most noticeable ( and annoying ) on damp or cold days . My dealer says he ca n't reproduce the problem - I think I 'll just sell the car . Jeff Goss

'' Organization : The World Public Access UNIX , Brookline , MA Lines : 16 I 've started getting a message from Windows 3.1 whenever I try to execute a DOS program from Windows , either thru the Program Manager or the File Manager . A message box comes up and says `` This program or one of its components is compressed . Use the MS-DOS expand command to expand the file .

Before , the Members of the European Parliament ( MEPs ) were just Members of National Parliaments ( MNPs ) elected by and from among their peers . In the European Parliament , every Member State has a fixed number of seats , which increases less than proportionally with the population . Once in five years , a general European election is being held , in which the citizens of all Member States choose their representatives to the European Parliament . Next elections are due in 1994 . Now the voting system for these European elections still differs from one country to another . Although the European Treaty enabling the direct election of the MEPs requires a uniform voting system , up to now every country has just used its own system , more or less the same one used for national elections . British MEPs are elected in a first-past-the-post system with one MEP per district ; nearly all other States have chosen a system with proportional representation . But then in some countries ( France , Italy ) MEPs are allowed to be a MNP as well , whilst in others they are not ( Belgium , Netherlands ) . The European Parliament is now working on a uniform election system for its own members , so that every candidate should have the same regulations to comply with , regardless of the Member State ( s ) he wants to be elected for . I would like to know what you people out there think of the following questions : 1 . Do you think it is necessary to have uniform regulations or should every Member State continue to use its own regulations ( for European elections that is ) ? 2 . Do you think a system of majority voting should be implemented , with one or more MEPs per district , or would you prefer a system with proportional representation ( for the whole of the Community or per state , per region , per district ? ) . 3 . Do you think the European Commission ( or just its president ) should be directly elected too , or should it be appointed by the European Parliament , or by the joint Member State governments as it is now ? 4 . The Maastricht Treaty allows subjects of Member States to stand for election in another Member State they are residing in . Do you think you would or could vote for a foreigner if his/her ideas appeal to you ? 5 . Do you think MEPs should be allowed to be a member of a national parliament or a regional parliament too ? Or a member of a national or regional government body ? 6 . The European Parliament now has meetings in both Strasbourg and Brussels . MEPs themselves are for a complete move to Brussels in great majority , but political compromises between the governments of the Member States stick to the status quo . Do you approve of this or do you think the European Parliament should meet in one city only , and if yes , which ? Please post your answers to eunet.politics , to which all followups are automatically directed . If you do not have access to that group , please mail your answer directly to me and I will post it for you .

The Ultra Pro was nearly as fast in text handling , but was blown away in the CAD and Paint tests . As an additional test , we hand-timed a complex CorelDraw ! slide resize/- redraw times . There was no swapping , but I 'd expect there is a fairly heavy load on the CPU . The Graphite redraw times averaged about 10.2 seconds , with ATI Ultra Pro at 12.0 . This jives with Steve Gibson's contention that the ISA Graphite is faster than an ATI UP on his complex Micrografx Draw document . So far , I 'm *very* impressed . The drivers look solid , and the card flies . The installation and utilities are different , but comparable to ATI 's . And I did n't have to wait for Build 59 for some reliability ...

MEK has a methyl ( CH3 ) on one side , and an ethyl ( C2H5 ) on the other . Acetone has two methyls . So acetone is not methyl ethyl ketone , but instead is dimethyl ketone . Both solvents have similar properties . I think that MEK may be a little less flammable but a lot worse to breathe . It 's a lot harder to buy MEK than it once was . Use acetone .

Candida can do that to you . : - ) Gordon , I think that the best clinical trial for candida blooms would involve giving women with chronic vaginal candida blooms L. Acidophilus orally and see it it can decrease the frequency and extent of candida blooms in the vagina since most of the candida seems to be migrating in from the anal region and L. acidophilus should be able keep the candida in check if it can make it through the intestinal tract and colonize in the anus where it will have access to oxygen ( just like it does in the vagina ) . As much stuff as there is in the lay press about L. acidophilus and vaginal yeast infections , I 'm really amazed that someone has not done a clinical trial yet to check it out . The calcium and kidney stone story is not a good reason to throw all conventional wisdom out the window . Where would medicine be if conventional wisdom had not been used to develop many of the standard medical practices that could not be confirmed through clinical trials ? The clinical trial is a very new arrival on the medical scene ( and a very important one ) . The lack of proof that reinnoculation with good bacteria after antibiotic use is important to the health of a patient is no reason to dismiss it out-of-hand , especially if reinnoculation can be done cleaply and safely ( like it is in animal husbandry ) .

Anyway , what you say is not really true . The color information is associated with a GraphicsContext , not with a display , and the GC _IS_ a parameter to the drawing routines . So , if you need to fast switch between green dotted lines and blue ones of width 2 , you can make 2 GCs for those cases and then simply do XDrawLine ( dpy , win , gc_red , x1 , y1 , x2 , y2 ) ; XDrawLine ( dpy , win , gc_blue , x3 , y3 , x4 , y4 ) ; for this effect . This is eventually more complicated to do for the programmer , but also much more efficient and flexible . You would not include all the other parameters like line pattern , with , cap and joinstyle , drawmode and so on in every drawing call , so why do it for color ? BTW , stay away from XDrawPoint ( ) if you do n't really need it ( to draw RANDOM points ) , for image transfers there are Image routines . -- +-o-+ -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- +-o-+ | o | \\\- Brain Inside -/// | o | | o | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ | o | | o | Andre ' Beck ( ABPSoft ) mehl : Andre_Beck @ IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de | o | +-o-+ -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- +-o-+

Very well indeed . At home ( a VL Bus version of the Graphics Pro ) I can stretch an AVI window to 640x480 and it will continue to play back smoothly . It drops a few more frames but on most machines even attempting such a thing would mean one frame update every 30 seconds . An ISA Graphics+ was able to do `` Zoom by 2 '' without any perceptible performance penalty . It is the best performance I 've seen so far with the possible exception of an Intel Indeo board ( which uses overlay so it does n't have to move the decompressed data over the ISA bus at any point ) .

For example , take plain DES . The unsuspecting user inputs a string `` PLAINTEXT '' to be enciphered . He cranks the algorithm which has been hacked by George Quisling and comes out with j*3H4902d . Nine char in and nine chars out . Right ? The unsepecting user ships the ciphertext to be decrpyted and the message `` PLAINTEXT '' is produced . Everything fine , right ? Nope . Imagine the algorithm did a LZ compression on PLAINTEXT before DESing . ( Compressing is down to four characters with more entropy : 9 # wj The opponent now pads the message with his own message , also compressed *3dk @ before applying DES to the concatenated compressed pairs . When decrpyted , the first compressed message is stripped off and declared sent . Unbeknowst to the receiver , the opponents accomplice collects the remaining message in the bit bucket and uncompresses to KILL NOW . And to prevent all such subliminal or covert storage channels you would need to have maximal entropy all the time -- which is a priori impossible because ( for example ) a stereotypical message might be replaced by one bit in the output reserving the rest of the output bits for the long covert message . In other words , if you opponent get to muck with the algorithm -- you either have got to muck with it LAST or concede his possible embedding of covert channels . In other words , if you present a message to an opponet with less than maximal entropy then you have given him free bits of storage . -- grady @ netcom.com 2EF221 / 15 E2 AD D3 D1 C6 F3 FC 58 AC F7 3D 4F 01 1E 2F

At the very least [ BH ] we can say that both sides exchanged shelling , with occasional [ BH ] aerial raids by Israel on Lebanese villages . [ BH ] In any case Steve 's characterization that the 1982 invasion was only in [ BH ] response to years of shelling from Lebanon is false .

Basil , I was only correcting Steve 's statement that Geurillas were shelling Israel from the Golan , which was absurd . The fact that `` Israel did much more shelling '' was in response to Palestinian shelling from Lebanon . Israel has no intention of keeping an inch of Lebanese territory . Israel will continue to fight Hizbullah , PLO , FPLP etc . as long as its northern border is not quiet . If the Lebanese army can control these elements then I think we can see genuine peace on the Israel-Lebanese border . I remind you that a couple thousand Lebanese cross each day into Israel to work . As for the election of Bashir Gemayel , it is true that he was favorable to Israel , is that why the Syrians killed him ? His brother Amin was a Syrian puppet , if he had not been , he would have been dead by now .

Cute characterization Bill ; however , there is no inconsistency between the two statements . Even if one believes that religion is `` primitive , simple-minded and unscientific , anti-intellectual and childish '' , one can still hold the view that religion also adds an unnecessary level of complexity to the explanation . The ideas themselves do n't have to be complex before being excised by Occam 's Razor , they only have to add unnecessarily to the overall complexity of the description . > Which is it to be - which > is the `` non-essential '' , and how do you know ?

You are quite confident that essences do not exist . How do propose to define beings ? Can a thing can be *one* without definition ? Can a being have a definition and know essence ?

But colonic flushes are not the way to improve gut function . Each person has almost a unique mix of bacteria in his/her gut . Diet affects this mix as does the use of antibiotics . A diet change is a much better way to alter the players in your gut than is colonic flushes . Cross contamination has been a real problem in some of the outfits that do this `` treatment '' since the equipment is not always cleaned as well as it should be between patient `` treatments '' . Dental drills have me a little concerned about HIV infection and I 've picked a dentist that uses both chemical and autoclave sterilization of his instruments ( more clostly but much safer ) . Full sterile technique is also used just like that practiced in an OR ( mask , gloves and gowns worn and disposed of between patients ) . Each visit costs me 15 dollars more than the standard and customary fee so I have to pay it out of pocket . His much higher fees do not drive away patients . I can not think of any good reason why someone should subject themselves to this colonic flush procedure . For very little , if any benefit , you subject yourself to hepatitis , cholera , parasitic disease and even HIV . Just ask yourself why someone might resort to this kind of treatment ? Could they be having GI distress ? Could this distress be due to a pathogenic organism ? Could I get this organism if the equipment is not cleaned properly between patients ? Do I really want to take this risk ? Food for thought . Marty B .

If > that is true , the kind monitor would not make any difference becuase everything > on the screen can be picked-up from the video controller . Can anybody verify > or refute this ? You are correct ( several times ) . TEMPEST is a codeword for a standard , shared between the NATO governments , to limit the inadvertent emission of information by either electromagnetic radiation or conduction . The limits set in the standard are classified but there is open source information to the effect that either the electrical or magnetic components of electromagnetism can be exploited . It is a basic rule of physics that there is an electromagnetic field associated with any path that conducts a flow of electrons . Among other things , I drive a 1987 Korean built AT clone and an associated 24 pin dotmatrix printer . The major source of unintentional emission is the CRT . To that can be added the video driver card , the RS232 parallel cable and the printer head . The emissions from these are gross can be detected with the crudest of equipment . Were I to apply good test equipment and some intelligence to measuring emission levels , I would find many other potential sources of leaked information . Where cryptography is used for serious purposes , poor TEMPEST protection becomes an important security hazard . In the early eighties , the need to allow some commercial concerns , particularly financial institutions , a level of protection against TEMPEST threat led to a series of briefings to invited corporations and to the 'release ' of a cut-down TEMPEST stansard for commercial use . I say 'release ' for while equipment to meet the standard is available ( at a price and to approved customers ) AFAIK even the commercial standard remains classified . If you think about it , it would really have to would n't it ? -- -= Owen Lewis =- @ Tele/fax +44- ( 0 ) 794-301731 ELOKA Consultancy & Project Management oml @ eloka.demon.co.uk pgp 2.x public key on request
From : johnson @ SantaFe.edu ( George Johnson ) Subject : 13 '' monitor jitter Organization : The Santa Fe Institute Lines : 30 NNTP-Posting-Host : sfi.santafe.ede X-Newsreader : TIN [ version 1.1 PL8 ] Several weeks ago , I described a problem with my Apple High-Resolution monitor and promised to summarize replies received by e-mail . To recapitulate : Occasionally , every two or three hours or so , my monitor momentarily loses sync . The entire raster image bounces down about an eighth of an inch or so , then rights itself . This usually happens right after I close a large window , highlight a large area , or do something that radically alters the image on the screen . Sometimes , though , it happens with no provocation whatsoever . I have received a bewildering range of replies . At one extreme was a man , clearly quite knowledgable about monitors , who said that the problem was that the 13 '' monitor 's power supply simply could n't always keep up with sudden changes of the raster image ; the rapid change from a largely light screen to a largely dark one overtaxed the monitor's power supply . There was no fix available , he said , because nothing was really wrong . ( I guess he meant that the flaw was so fundamental that it had to be endured . ) This seemed quite persuasive and I would have been tempted to adopt an attitude of stoicism , except for a reply from a 13 '' monitor owner who discovered that this very problem is documented in the Apple Service Technical Procedures , Volume 3 , under the heading Jitter Correction . The section describes a fix involving the replacement of a capacitor , the adjustment of a potentiometer , or , failing that , the swap of a circuit board . I would be grateful for a discussion among those who have had experience with this sort of thing .

In X10 , the drawing attributes were bundled into drawing requests ; that is , the server 's drawing model was stateless . This caused problems with performance and network traffic , so the X11 redesign included the graphic context to codify the drawing state . Most application designers who want to draw things in several different colors create a GC for each color during initialization , then pass the GC id in each drawing request .

Works great but with every passing day I fall behind on how many great 14.4s are out . Zoom is out of the question from what I 'm hearing . AT & T has a great product from what I hear and the Sportster is really cheap now too . If you want to receive a fax , your computer will have to be on , but not the monitor and of course the modem . You can set the number of rings that will receive the fax on a specific ring you set with Fax STF software . It 's entirely up to you how to arrange that . I 've had faxes sent to me which is great but I 've been home to set it . I do n't have a need to set fax receiving up all day . Also I hear there is a device that can channel all incoming phone signals for about $ 70 .

Being my anxiety level is peaking and you folks have no clue who I am I may as well post the specifics and see what you people think regarding my previous post . To recap i applied to 20 schools total , 16 of which were MD and 4 DO . as it stands now i have had 13 rejects , 4 interviews ( 2 MD and 2 DO ) , the results of which are 2 waiting lists ( 1 MD and one DO ) 3 schools i heard nothing from at all . I have contacted all institutions other than the rejects and they have no info whatsoever to tell me . I have taken a good mix to apply to.. 2-3 top schools a bunch of middles and a few `` safety '' ( funny that most of my safety schools were the first to reject me ) my index is at like a 3.5 mcats were R7 P9 B10 WQ and R7 P9 B11 WR I couldnt get the damn reading score up ... i never stuff like art history , politics etc Ive done medical research at the undergrad level , done clinical lab work for years now , but unfortunately i have no patient contact experience . I cant think of what else i left out ... but thats the summary . What percent of people are usually called from the waiting lists on an average ? I felt that my interviews went quite well yet i dont have a firm acceptance in my hand ... anyone have any suggestions as to calm the mailbox anxiety ?

What about private networks ? I suspect the government feels it is enough to prevent companies from offering secure encryption services . Big companies do n't take that kind of risk . They 're too visible and have too much to lose . The US government may not have to make encryption illegal to prevent its use . If they could credibly say to IBM or MIT : you will receive no US government money next year unless you follow these voluntary guidelines on use of encryption , I doubt either organization would delay making use of encryption a violation of local policies . The US government gets much of its power by making it impractical to operate without getting money from the government while putting restrictions on use of such money that would be illegal if they were enacted as laws . -- John Carr ( jfc @ athena.mit.edu )

As a baptist clergyperson , I find the idea of such a `` baptism '' ( if the news report is in fact accurate , and they seldom are regarding religion ) offensive . The pastor here seems to have a most unbaptist view of baptism- one that seems to demand the ceremony even when comprehension and choice are absent . We do baptize converts , but no one who has been deceived into hearing the word is likely to be a convert . If in fact the grace of God might work in such a situation , there is no harm done in waiting a day or two . Baptist believe in regenerate membership . Did this church include these half-baked ( at best ) converts into their church fellowship ? Or do they somehow feel there is some validity in dunking them and turning them loose ? This kind of `` evangelism '' is certainly not baptist , and probably not very christian , either . revdak @ netcom.com

Just because a fax modem behaves like a printer on a `` local '' machine , does n't guarantee functionality when a `` local '' machine has fax software printing to a `` remotely installed '' fax card . I tried this with Workgroups and the fax software did n't like it at all . Could have been WinFAX's peculiarisms but I do n't think so . A lot of special hardware interaction takes place internally .

Seriously : Jerome is merely ( and grandly ) another Christian witness , to be taken for what he can tell us . He is one in the community of saints . You seem to wish for a greater polarization and dichotomy between Catholic and Protestant thought than seems to me , from a historical perspective , to be valid . To be sure , Rome rejects ( some significant aspects of ) Protestant thought just as vehemently as Protestants reject ( some significant aspects of ) Roman thought . Other than some peoplw who apparently try to embody the greatest extreme of this rejection , on either side , there is not quite so vast a gulf fixed as casual observers seem to assume . Ecumenical consultations between Rome and the Lutherans , as well as those between Rome and the Anglican communion ( to which I belong ) show very nearly complete convergence on understanding the basic theological issues -- the sticking points tend to be ecclesiology and church polity . Thus , for example , as you go on to say : > They should > remeber that after the Decree of Pope St. Damsus I , Many of us do not regard a papal decretal as having any necessary ( as opposed to political ) significance . Sometimes it will , sometimes it wo n't . You misread me if you think that my communion , at least , `` throws out '' the deuterocanonical books . Nor do I think you should overstress the sense in which the more Reformed may do so . > Again , why must the Church of Jesus Christ adopt the canon of the > unbelieving Jews , drawn up in Jamnia in 90 AD , in countering the > Christian use of the Septuagint . ^^^^^ I seriously suggest you rethink what you are saying here . It verges on , and could be taken as , anti-Semitic in the worst sense . The `` unbelieving '' Jews were , according to what I understand as a Christian , the chosen people of God , and the recipients of His pre-Incarnational revelation . I think they have some say in the matter . The Javneh meeting should not be over-interpreted . A recent magisterial study titled _Mikra_ ( I don't have more citation information on hand , sorry ) produced primarily from the background of Christian ( rather than specifically Jewish ) scholarship suggests strongly that the Javneh meeting mostly resolved a lingering question , where in practice the canon had long been fixed on the basis of the scrolls that were kept in the Temple , and thereby `` made the hands unclean '' when used . The list of `` sacred books '' that may be drawn up from Josephus and other pre-Yavneh sources correspond ( plus or minus one book , if I rememeber the chapter correctly ) to the current Jewish canon of Tanakh . All of this is not to `` throw out '' the deuterocanonicals ( what , by the way , is YOUR position about the books the Greeks accept and Rome does not ? : - ) ) -- just to observe that the issue is complex and simply binary judgment does not do it justice . > > Andy Byler -- Michael L.

Since Christians citing the Bible in such a context > should be presumed to have at least READ the story , it amounts to slander > -- a charge that homosexuality == rape -- to use that against us . The story in Genesis 19 tells of the citizens of Sodom demanding an opportunity to `` know '' the two men who were Lot 's guests ; the fact that the Sodomites became angry when Lot offered them his daughters could be seen as indicating that they were interested only in homosexual intercourse . Yes , what they wanted was rape , homosexual rape , and everybody agrees that that is wrong . Some Christians believe that the homosexual aspect of their desire was just as sinful as the rape aspect of their desire . The passage does not say what it was that so offended God , whether it was the homosexuality , or the intended rape , or both , but I believe that it is only fair to consider all the possible alternatives in the light of related Scriptures . I do not believe that those who believe God was offended by both the homosexuality and the rape are trying to say that homosexuality is itself a form of rape . You seems to take the view that the *only* sin described in Gen. 19 is in the fact that the Sodomites wanted to commit rape , and that it is unfair to '' stigmatize '' their homosexuality by associating it with the sin of rape . I can see how you might reach such a conclusion if you started from the conclusion that there is nothing wrong with homosexuality , but then again we 're not supposed to start from our conclusions because that 's circular reasoning . If God is in fact opposed to homosexual intercourse in general , then the more probably interpretation is that He was at least as offended by the Sodomites ' blatant homosexuality as He was by their intent to commit rape . Later on I will document why I believe the Old Testament portrays God as One who despises *any* homosexual intercourse , even if both partners are consenting adults . > > '' ...

And such > were > > some of you ... '' I Cor . 6:9-11 . > > The moderator adequately discusses the circularity of your use of _porneia_ > in this . The moderator found my proposal to be circular in that he regarded the church as the proper authority for determining what *kinds* of marriages would be legitimate , and thus the church 's refusal to recognize `` perverted '' marriages was circular reasoning . My questions , however , had nothing to do with the church ordaining new kinds of marriages , and so his argument was something of a straw man . In terms of my original question , the precise definition/translation of `` porneia '' is n't really important , unless you are trying to argue that the Bible does n't really condemn extramarital sex . I 'm not sure the moderator was trying to do that . In any case , I think both you and the moderator have missed the point here . When Jesus was asked about divorce , He replied , `` Have you not read , that He who created them from the beginning made them male and female , and said , 'For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall cleave to his wife ; and the two shall become one flesh ' ? Consequently they are no longer two , but one flesh . What therefore God has joined together , let no man separate . '' ( Mt . 19:4-6 ) . I read here that the sexual union of a man ( male ) and his wife ( female ) is a divinely-ordained union . In other words , the institution of heterosexual marriage is something ordained and established by God -- not by men , and not by the church , but by God . Men are not supposed to dissolve this union , in Jesus ' words , because it is not something created by men . This is not circular reasoning , this is just reading God 's word . I read in the Bible that God ordained the union of male and female . I do not read of any similar divinely-ordained union of two males or two females . Granted , there have been uninspired men who have ordained `` alternative '' unions ( is n't Caligula reported to have `` married '' his horse ? ) , but the only union that Jesus refers to as `` what God has joined together '' is the heterosexual union of a man and his wife . ( Pardon me for mentioning Caligula . I know that 's probably inflammatory , and I should save it for the discussion on bestiality , in part 2 of this post . Please hold off on passing judgement on me until you have read that section of my reply . ) Anyway , my original question was not whether we should translate `` porneia '' in a way that condemns only a select few kinds of extramarital sex , my question was : given that heterosexual marriage is the only union described by the Bible as divinely-ordained , and given a Biblical prohibition against sex outside of marriage , is homosexual intercourse sinful ? Of course , I see now that first we need to ask whether the Bible really condemns sex outside of marriage . You seem to be trying to argue that only certain kinds of extramarital sex ( and other sins ) are really wrong : > > I think we can all agree ( with Paul ) that there are SOME kinds of > activity that could be named by `` fornication '' or `` theft '' or `` coveting '' or > '' reviling '' or `` drunkenness '' which would well deserve condemnation .

Alternatively , it may be that the definition of such terms as `` porneia '' and all the rest was , in Paul 's day , what we would call a FAQ ; i.e . the Law , as the '' tutor '' appointed by God to lead us to Christ , had just spent some sixteen centuries drumming into the heads of God 's people the idea that things like homosexual intercourse were abominations that deserved punishment by death . Perhaps Paul did n't go into detail on what `` porneia '' & c were because after 1600 years he considered the question to have been dealt with already . Perhaps the reason God 's apostles and prophets did not devote a great deal of time defining a distinct , New Testament sexuality was because He did not intend any significant changes in the sexuality He had already established by the Law . I 'll discuss the Law and homosexuality in greater detail below , but I just wanted to point out that the New Testament 's failure to develop a detailed new standard of sexuality is not necessarily evidence that God does not care about sexual conduct -- especially after 1600 years of putting people to death for practicing homosexuality ! > Homosexual behavior is no different .

And how do you define an `` obsessively driven '' mode of sexual behavior ? How do you determine the difference between obsessive sexual behavior and normal sex drives ? Is the desire to have `` sinful '' sex an obsessively driven mode of behavior ? I think you see that this is circular reasoning : Why is it defined as sinful ? Because it is obsessive . What makes it obsessive ? The fact that the person is driven to seek it even though it 's sinful . Or is it obsessive because it is a desire for that which society condemns ? Once again , that 's circular : Why is it defined as obsessive ? Because the person wants it even though society condemns it . Why does society condemn it ? Because it is obsessive . You seem to be trying to limit the Bible 's condemnation of `` porneia '' to only '' perverted '' sex acts , but I do n't think you can really define `` perverted '' without falling into exactly the same circularity you accuse me of . What , then , is Paul condemning when he declares that `` Fornicators ... shall not enter the kindgom of heaven '' ? > I wo n't deal with the exegesis of Leviticus , except very tangentially . > Fundamentally , you are exhibiting the same circularity here as in your > assumption that you know what _porneia_ means . I think you misunderstood me : I was not trying to make an argument on some technical definition of `` porneia '' , I was raising the issues of the sinfulness of extramarital sex and the lack of any Scriptural evidence of a homosexual counterpart to the divinely-ordained union of heterosexual couples . > There are plenty of > laws prohibiting sexual behavior to be found in Leviticus , most of > which Christians ignore completely .

Please remember what you just said here for when we discuss bestiality , in part 2 . > On what basis , other than assuming your conclusion , can you > say that the law against male-male intercourse in Leviticus is NOT a part > of the ritual law ? I am glad you asked . Would you agree that if God condemns homosexual intercourse even among those who are not under the Law of Moses , then this would show that God 's condemnation of homosexual acts goes beyond the ritual law ? If I can show you from Scripture that God punished the homosexual behavior of people who were *not* under the Law of Moses , would you agree that God 's definition of homosexual intercourse as an abomination is not limited to just the ritual law and those who are under the Law ? I 've been having a private Email discussion with a 7th Day Adventist on the subject of the Sabbath , and my main point against a Christian sabbath-keeping requirement has been that nowhere in Scripture does God command Gentiles to rest on the sabbath , nor does He ever condemn Gentiles for failing to rest on the Sabbath . This illustrates the difference between universal requirements such as `` Thou shalt not kill '' , and requirements that are merely part of the ( temporary , Jews-only ) Law of Moses , such as the Sabbath . The point you are trying to make is that you think the classification of homosexual intercourse as `` an abomination '' is *just* a part of the temporary , Jews-only Law of Moses . I on the other hand believe that it was labelled by God as an abomination for Gentiles as well as Jews , and that He punished those guilty of this behavior by death or exile . Here 's why : Back in Genesis 15 , God promises to give Abraham all the land that was then in the possession of `` the Amorite '' -- kinda hard on the Amorite , do n't you think ? But in verse 16 we have a clue that this might not be as unjust as it sounds : it seems God is going to postpone this takeover for quite a while , because `` the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet complete '' . Remember , this is all long before there was a ritual law . What then was the iniquity the Amorite was committing that , when complete , would justify his being cast out of his own land and/or killed ? Go back and look at Lev . 18 again . Verses 1-23 list a variety of sins , including child sacrifice , incest , homosexuality , and bestiality . Beginning in verse 24 , God starts saying , `` Do not defile yourselves by any of these things ; for _by_all_these_ _things_ the nations which I am casting out before you _have_ _become_defiled_ . For the land has become defiled , therefore I have visited its punishment upon it , so the land has spewed out its inhabitants ... For whoever does any of these abominations , those persons who do so shall be cut off from among their people . '' Notice that God says the Gentile nations ( who are *not* under the ritual Law of Moses ) are about to be punished because they have `` defiled '' themselves and their land by committing `` abominations '' that include incest , bestiality , and homosexuality . Flip ahead two chapters to Lev . 20 , and you will find these same `` abominations '' listed , and this time God decrees the death penalty on anyone involved in any of these things , including , specifically , a man `` lying with another man as one lies with a woman '' ( Lv . 20:13 ) . Their '' bloodguiltiness '' was upon them , meaning that in God 's eyes , they deserved to die for having done such things . According to Lev . 18:26-29 , even `` the alien [ non-Jew ] who sojourns among you '' was to refrain from these practices , on penalty of being `` cut off [ by God ? ] from among their people . '' Under the circumstances , I believe it would be very difficult to support the claim that in the Old Testament God objected only to the intended rape , and not the homosexuality , in Sodom . Since God took the trouble to specifically list sex between two consenting men as one of the reasons for wiping out the Canaanite nations , ( not homosexual rape , mind you , but plain , voluntary gay sex ) , I 'd say God was not neutral on the subject of homosexual behavior , even by those who had nothing to do with the Mosaic Covenant . > For those Christians who *do* think that *some* parts of Leviticus can > be `` law '' for Christians ( while others are not even to be thought about ) > it is incumbent on you *in every case , handled on its own merits* to > determine why you `` pick '' one and ignore another . According to II Tim . 3:16 , all Scripture is inspired by God and is profitable for teaching , reproof , correction , and training in righteousness ; thus , I believe that even though we Gentile Christians are not under the Law , we can learn from studying it . If a certain action is defined as a sin because it is a violation of the Law , then it is a sin only for those who are under the Law ( for example , in the case of Sabbath-keeping ) . Where God reveals that certain actions are abominations even for those who are not under the Law , then I conclude that God 's objection to the practice is not based on whether or not a person is under the Law , but on the sinfulness of the act itself . In the case of homosexuality , homosexual intercourse is defined by God as a defiling abomination for Gentiles as well as Jews , i.e . for those who are not under the Law as well as for those who are . Thus , I am not at all trying to say that Gentile Christians have any obligation to keep any part of the Law , I am simply saying that God referred to homosexuality as a sin even for those who are not obligated to keep the Law . If this is so , then I do not think we can appeal to our exemption from the Law as valid grounds for legitimizing a practice God has declared a bloodguilty abomination that defiles both Jew and Gentile .

I agree , with the exception that I do n't preach ignoring our cultures . > The body as a whole must be unified .

It released > all churches from the use of the Latin Mass ( unity ) to allow them to > speak to the people in the common language ( diversity ) . In Revelation 2-3 , we see that in the first century church , there was one congregation in each major city . So there was one unified church . Now in each city , there were people of different cultures . Naturally , they formed something of a stew , with different members having different heritages . Nevertheless , they were ONE body . They met together , sometimes as smaller groups in their homes and sometimes in bigger groups in places such as the temple courts . Now in a particular city , then and now , you will find that there is a common language associated with that region . For instance , in Rome , Latin was spoken . In the United States today , English is spoken . So it would make sense that congregations in different cities would speak the common language and not necessarily Latin . Naturally , you would expect the lead evangelist to preach in the common language . In the first century church , there were probably many people in the congregation who could speak a given tongue to translate the message for people of foreign ethnic groups . Today , however , you don't see people speaking in tongues to translate sermons , even in so-called Pentacostal churches . We do have a modern day equivalent though -- bi-lingual speakers . Now in the unified church of which I am a member - sometimes called the International Churches of Christ , when we all meet together on Sundays , there are headphones on people who do n't speak English from which they hear an ongoing translation of the sermon in their native tongue . Neat idea , huh ? Now , we meet in different size groups in a random sort of way on Sundays , so sometimes there will be a meeting of only Haitians or of Spanish- speaking people , for example , who will hear an evangelist preach in their native language . In addition , we meet in small groups a couple of times during the week for Bible discussion groups and Devotionals . So someone who speaks a different language will almost always be with people who also speak his language ( assuming the congregation is large enough ) for those meetings . As for the people who speak the common language , they can keep in touch with their culture , if they want , but they will also have equally deep friendships among their church relationships with people of many various nationalities . > Has the purpose of the church been thwarted by this action ? The action of letting Catholics worship in a native language instead of Latin ? Indeed not ! See my second paragraph in response to the second clipping of your article . However , if you mean the action of forming denominations based on a culture , then the purpose of the church has been indeed thwarted . I 'll assume the second possiblility when answering your next clipping . > Rather I believe it has been enhanced , for Paul exhorts us to become as > one of them that we might reach them . Thus , if a person or group of > people feel more comfortable `` among their own '' , shall we not give them a > place where they can feel comfortable [ with their heritage ] and still > l [ ove God ? ] { [ my guess - Aaron ] } You have met some needs of people , certainly , by helping them to be proud of their cultural heritages when most denominations did n't . Yet you have largely isolated yourselves from having quality `` Christian '' friendships outside your nationality ( and your denomination ) . We shall certainly give people a place to feel comfortable with their heritage . However , we will do this in a way that does not destroy church unity , but rather encourages friendships among all disciples . > This is the approach of some of the groups that you cite . It sounds like these groups have wonderful intentions , but they are going about things in the wrong way . And names like the African Methodist Episcopal Church still make me cringe , although not as much as before . I understand that there was more racism in the past that caused such groups to be formed , but now we should try to unite . I know that it's hard for many people on this newsgroup to imagine there being only one body of people on earth , but it is quite possible , and I am working to make it happen . However , what might be a smaller step towards unity , would be taking the word `` African '' out of your denomination 's name . Then perhaps someday a long time off , you can also remove the `` Methodist Episcopal '' part also , and simply be part of `` the Church '' . > With regard to inclusivity , I note tht your .sig emits from MIT .

That shows me that you indeed have the heart to spread the gospel of Jesus as well as take part in your cultural heritage . Thank you also for responding to my post . I know ( all too well ) how they can be very time-consuming . The whole idea of celebrating your culture is paved with good intentions , but I still feel that you must restore and preserve unity at the same time . My own church , the Boston church , has the acapella singing that you mentioned in your post , yet does n't limit expression of my Mexican culture , even though I am in the MIT Campus ministry and not the Spanish ( speaking ) Zone . I have made a commitment to God that I will go to the Sunday services of my church , because I know that my brothers and sisters here are fully devoted in love for God as his disciples . I do n't believe in tongues , as you may have already picked up on , because of my understanding of Biblical Christianity . However , I am certainly willing to visit your congregation provided that it does n't interfere with my normal worship . Since you also live in Cambridge , I also extend an invitation to you to visit our services as often as you like . You can meet the MIT students at the Student Center ( across from 77 Mass . Ave. ) at 9AM on Sundays to leave for worship or simply call me after Wednesday night to find out where the service will be held on a particular day . My number is 225-7598 , but will be 354-1357 in a few weeks from now and for the rest of the summer .

From : carlo @ merlin.cvs.rochester.edu ( Carlo Tiana ) Subject : Quadra 950 marginal video ? Summary : sync problems on multiple boards Nntp-Posting-Host : merlin.cvs.rochester.edu Organization : University of Rochester , Rochester NY Lines : 61 We are having a problem with a Quadra 950 that has stumped a couple of techs sent to us by the vendor , as well as us : - ) This Quadra is 'stuffed ' with 64Mb RAM , 2Mb VRAM and some large disk ( 400Mb I think ) . What happens is that after a certain variable interval of time the video circuitry 'loses ' vertical sync . It is quite apparent that the Mac CPU is still ok , and the problem really seems to lie with the video circuitry , since you can still save your documents , quit your aplpications , even pull down menus etc . ( only the display is scrolling lik crazy , so it's pretty hard to hit menu items ; - ) We had the original logic board replaced twice now , and the same problem has been occurring on all boards although the inteval between occurrences has varied . The first board had this problem every about 1hr , more often if the cache was turned OFF ( yes OFF ) . This is the only symptom that is not obviously related to the video circuitry ( after all the cache is on the CPU right ? ) . The second board had the problem every about 10 minutes ( we did not keep it , rather we put the original back ) , the current board we have has this problem a lot less often ( has gone about a week without doing it , but did it twice within an hour yesterday ) . The technicians that have come out to try to figure it out seemed pretty sharp and tried a number of sensible things ( most of which we had previously tried ourselves anyway ) . These included : -swapping the RAM -swapping the VRAM -swapping monitors ( 3 different 13 '' Apple RGB and 2 16 '' Apple RGB ) -swapping cables -disconnecting HD and booting from floppy -sacrificing various small mammals Here are some other facts : -when we put a RasterOps ProColor 32 on the NuBus , the problem is fixed ( it does not occur with the internal video or the ProColor video out ) -the vendor can not reproduce the problem back in their shop on the boards that exhibit it in our lab -Apple is said to be getting a little bit pissed off at shipping us boards that they can not find anything wrong with , and getting them shipped back as faulty according to us . Here are some speculations : -I bet that neither Apple nor the vendor has tested these boards with that much RAM and VRAM on them simultaneaously , which may have something to do with their finding it hard to reproduce the problem ( though we can reproduce it with just 4Mb of RAM , so this is probably a red herring ) . -the vendor 's representative blames 'metal in your walls ' - claims that our walls have metal in them which interferes with the Mac 's operation . We have another 950 in the lab which works like a charm ( though it 's not in the exact same spot ... . ) Please do n't tell me this is probably it , I do not want to believe it . -it 's probably not poltergeists , since they do not have badges to get past security at the entrance to our site .

This I appreciated very much . I would however like to know why it is that ther is simply NO information out there on some subjects for the relativly novice graphics programmer . The subjects are 1 ) How do you access the extra video memory on a video board . I know somwhere there aresome standard video bios calls that allow you to dothis . I have 1meg of memory on my board and according to all the books and info I have read I am only ( at maximum ) using 256k of it . There is a way to do this in standard VGA cause I have seen vidoe paging ( written in assembly , which I do n't know ) written into apps hat use mode 13h . To get any speed at all you have to do this . How do I do it ? 2 ) The vesa standard . What gives here . I have read most of what the net has to offer on VESA and as far as coding for VESA goes most of the advice is cryptic at best . Where do I get public domain info that will tell me in `` mostly plain '' english how the vesa calls work . My biggest gripe is about number 1 . I have bought graphics books , I have asked graphics professors , I have hunted the net through both gopher , and archie , I ahave asked apps programmers and it is like there is some lock on this information . Graphics programming books tell alot of programmiing algorithm information , but they always fall short of telling you how to really control the video bios . What are all the calls folks , I know there are people out there that know how to doall tis stuff . Where are you , and why have n't you written a book yet ?

Somebody correct ( flame ) me please ! You miss the point . A lot more negotiation is needed to convince women to have sex because there is a big taboo about women being free with their sex . Many of the women I know would do almost anything rather than be known as a slag , slut or whore . With men however there is *status* attached to being able to fuck constantly . And with gay men , where both partners can prove status through their constant verility then you are going to get a situation where there is a lot of sex . The difference is between het sex being rationed as a valuable commodity and gay sex being virtually unlimited due to the *appetites* of men .

One of them is the ERA statistic for : pitchers . What does it say ? ? ERA indicates the average number of earned runs attributed to a pitcher per nine inning game . Thus , if a pitcher pitched 3 innings and gave up 1 earned run , his 9 inning equivelent perfomance would be 3 earned runs , thus his ERA is 3.00 . To compute the ERA you simply take the number of earned runs divided by the innings pitched and then multiple the result by 9 . ERA = ( ER/IP ) * 9 An earned run is run that is given up by the pitcher that is not attributed to a fielding error . More specifically , if an error occurs that represented the third out , all runs scored after the error are considered UNEARNED runs . Earned runs are also runs scored as a result of players who were left on base when the pitcher exited the game . Here are some examples : If there are two outs in an inning and there are men on base . If an error occurs that represents the third out , all of the runs after this error and NOT counted as earned runs . If a pitcher issues some base on balls ( walks ) , and leaves the game before the inning is completed , he is responsible for the people who were left on base . If the those runners who were left on base score , and the score was not a result of an error , those eraned runs are attributed to the pitcher who left the game . I hope this explains things for you . Joe

Right , Arabs have been voting in Israel for how long ? And in all that time NOT ONE Arab EVER gained enough of a personal following to get his fellow party members to put in a Ministry ?

As far as security > goes I think that some serious gaffs were made by right wing Jews > as well - e.g . Sharon . Well yes , but Security is the reason most often given by people who want to make excuses . I merely thought it would crop up and so pre-empted it . Start of Article ( All commets in [ * ... .* ] are mine not Dr. Arens ) [ Comments in square brackets are mine - Yigal ] > From `` The OTHER Front '' , July 29 , 1992 . Translation of Ha'aretz article . Racism in the Knesset -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Coalition requirements on one hand , and the presence of progressive MKs from _Meretz_ in the coalition on the other , have compelled Rabin and his friends to change , to some extent , their attitude towards the Arab public and their representatives in the Knesset . Although he did refuse to view them as partners , taking part in the coalition and joining the government , he did agree to meet with them and to give them a document of intentions which included a commitment to `` work towards a decrease in the discrimination between Jewish and Arab citizens '' . [ Decrease WHAT ? ! ? ! But posters have told us time and again that such discrimination does not exist *at* *all* ! Is Rabin , too , a closet self-hater ? ? ? - Yigal ] . However , racism has not disappeared . When the Knesset sat to consider who would staff its various committees , a request was made to put an MK from Hadash [ the Communist party , one of the `` Arab '' parties - Yigal ] on the State Comptroller 's Committee . And oh , did that ever stir up a storm -- including in the ranks of Labor -- since many Knesset members find it unthinkable that an Arab MK sit on one of the important house committees . `` Security secrets '' are liable to fall into their hands ... This attitude -- which until recently had not even aroused criticism , being so natural and so deeply-embossed upon people 's hearts -- holds that there are Knesset members who , despite having been elected by tens of thousands of votes , are not entitled to be full partners in the body which represents the people of Israel . We are not speaking here of political discrimination -- which would be bad enough in itself -- but of racial discrimination . The proof : one of the compromises proposed was that MK Mahamid [ an Arab - Yigal ] should be replaced by Tamar Gojanski [ a Jew - Yigal ] from the same party . It was not the member's party which was considered unfit , but his race ... [ * Here is a documented case in a respected Israeli newspaper . * ] It is worth noting that for the first time since the state 's founding , a public debate has arisen on this subject , as witness the following article : A TEST OF SELF-CONFIDENCE By Gid'on Levi , Ha'aretz , July 26 , 1992 Revelations of discrimination against Arabs have become such an integral part of our daily routine that there is not much effort made to deal with them . [ Do you hear that , -- -- - ? Please contact this Levi fellow and explain to him how little he knows about Israel . Please ! - Yigal ] . Except that sometimes the demon bursts out from behind the government's window dressing , and then the phenomenon is seven times more serious . Last week provided two more such examples : the Israeli Knesset is finding it very difficult to allow Arab representation on its more important committees ; and Israel Television is finding it no less difficult to give a platform to Arabs from the territories . Seemingly two entirely different matters , but in fact they are one and the same . The 13th Knesset proved last week that , even though one third of its members are new faces , it has not renewed its own face at all , at least on one issue . Parliamentary traditions may be modernized and parliamentary traditions may become obsolete , and only one tradition endures forever : no Arab shall set foot in the more important committees of the house . There has never been and never will be an Arab MK on the External Affairs and Defense Committee or on the Finance Committee . Worlds have been overturned over the question of whether or not `` to give '' Arabs , for the first time , a place on the State Comptroller's Committee . The arguments are old and well-known : In all three of the above committees innumerable secrets are revealed -- and woe unto us if an Arab should hear them . One must not make light of such arguments , but their significance should also not be exaggerated . Every Arab MK is not spending all his time waiting for the opportune moment to hand over information from the Knesset committee room to Black Panther headquarters in Jenin ; and not all the aforementioned committees are continually occupied in the discussion of top-secret matters , which could safely be revealed , for example , to MKs supportive of the Jewish Underground , but not to an Arab MK from the Likud , Labor , or even from Hadash . The Arabs themselves would probably forego membership in the Subcommittee on Secret Service Matters , but what would happen , one may ask , if MK Nawaf Masalha were to hear , God forbid , a review of the Foreign Minister in an open meeting of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee , or even a review of the Army Chief of Staff which , in any case , are regularly leaked to the next edition of the news . And what would happen if MK Hashem Mahamid were to report on what he had seen with his own eyes at al-Najah ? Their non-participation [ in important committees ] and that of their colleagues , creates an intolerable situation , where Arab members of the elected house have only semi-positions . They are good enough for addressing plenary sessions , and for voting for or against the government and participating in the deliberations of the Immigration and Absorption Committee . But they must not , for example , participate in the process of formulating the state budget in the Finance Committee or in the allocation of resources to local authorities . In any case , they have little part in that . Labor 's dependence on the support of the Arab parties has brought about some improvement : MK Hashem Mahamid , will , it seems , participate in the State Comptroller 's Committee . Earlier , there had been a ridiculous attempt made to dictate to Hadash who their representative should be , and thus to prevent the Arab from entering this dubious holy-of-holies , but it soon became clear that there was no legal or constitutional backing for such a step . But not to worry : even now the Jewish mind is contriving devices . The new Committee Chair , Roni Milo , has already announced that he will set up subcommittees aplenty for his committee . Thus he will decide where it is permissible for Mahamid to participate and where not . A solution such as this could , by the way , also have been adopted for the rest of the committees , thereby completely eliminating the fear of state secrets being leaked to the enemy and removing the stain of discrimination from the Knesset .

From : dsew @ troi.cc.rochester.edu ( David Sewell ) Subject : Theophylline/ephedrine and water bio-availability Organization : University of Rochester - Rochester , New York Lines : 19 Nntp-Posting-Host : troi.cc.rochester.edu Does anyone know if either theophylline or ephedrine , or the two in combination , can reduce the body 's ability to make use of available water ? I had kind of an odd experience on a group hike recently , becoming dehyrated after about 9 hours of rigorous hiking despite having brought 1 1/2 gallons of water ( c. 6 liters ) . I drank close to twice as much as anyone else , and no one else was dehydrated . I do n't think general physical condition was an issue , since I was in at least the middle of the pack in terms of general stamina , so far as I could tell . It may be that I just plain need more water than most people . But I am wondering if theophylline and/or ephedrine might be aggravating things . I took a couple of Primatene tablets during the hike to control asthma ( 24 mg. ephedrine , 100 mg. theophylline ) . I gather that both those drugs are diuretics . So now I 'm wondering : does that mean they can reduce the body 's ability to utilize available water ? Would it be a particularly stupid thing to take that medication during hot-weather exercise ? ( I always assumed diuresis just meant you urinated a lot , but that was n't the case yesterday . )

I 'm interested in getting more information about Nanao 's products as well as some others that may fit the bill . I would like a monitor that can handle high resolutions like 1024x1024 NI . I 'm envisioning using this monitor on an Amiga 4000 or Amiga 2000 w/a graphics board like the Retina , and/or on a Sun like the SPARCstation LX . Basically I want a high resolution versital monitor . This monitor need not be large ( = > 17 '' ) if it meets the brief requirements as outlined above . I 've been very happy with a 16 '' on Suns and could probably cope with smaller at home . I 'm interested if anyone has more details on high quality Sony and Hitatchi monitors since they seem to be used on Sun 's fairly often and look pretty good ( to me at least ) . I have n't seem them brought up in c.s.i.p.h very often as are Mag and Viewsonic . Ok , stuff I 'd like to find out : How can I get ahold of Nanao ? What are the products in their line ?

'' Well , yes . This is the real mystery of the matter , and why I am rather dubious of a lot of the source theories . There are a number of places where the Masoretic Text ( MT ) of the OT is obscure and presumably corrupted . These are reproduced exactly from copy to copy . The DSS tend to reflect the same `` errors '' . This would appear to tell us that , at least from some point , people began to copy the texts very exactingly and mechanically . The problem is , we do n't know what they did before that . But it seems as though accurate transmission begins at the point at which the texts are perceived as texts . They may be added to ( and in some situations , such as the end of Mark , material is lost ) , but for the most part there are no substantial changes to the existing text . You 're basically trying to make a mountain out of a molehill . Some people like to use the game of `` telephone '' as a metaphor for the transmission of the texts . This clearly wrong . The texts are transmitted accurately . -- C.

Also , exact part | > numbers/company names etc . for the relays will help ! The first step is to make sure that there is no DC component , intentional or not , on the audio lines to be switched . If neither the output or input presents an unintentional DC level ( let 's say they 're capacitively coupled ) , then putting a 22 K resistor from each input to ground , and from the output to ground is a good precaution against leakage in any coupling caps presenting a DC level that is GUARANTEED to cause a click . If the device presents an unintentional DC level that is from more than just coupling capacitor leakage , then you need to remove the DC before switching with coupling capacitors of your own . If you have more than one relay ( each relay switching one input through to a common output ) , you can use make-before-break switching where for a brief instant both sources are connected during a switch change . This may mask the switch click . An audio switch that is clickless is made by taking a light bulb and making your own ersatz opto-isolator with a light-dependent resistor ( LDR ) sealed inside a piece of black heatshrink . Many broadcast consoles use this older , but time-honored technique . Claro actually makes a complete optisolator like this , but I do n't have a part number handy . Radio Shack has a LDR grab-bag ( 276-1657 ) you might want to try . For a simple , solid state clickless switch that is cheap , you might try looking at the CD4066 analog switch that is commonly available ( or its older predecessor , the 4016 ) . Again , the DC component must be removed prior to switching . Other alternatives include JFET switches ( both discrete and IC ) and diode switching ( which works relatively well , surprisingly ) . All the above , with their pitfalls and application tips could easily make a subject for a multi-page article . Solid state switches may induce a click of their own when turned on due to charge being injected into the audio line through device capacitance when the control signal changes state . Techniques to minimize this include lowering the impedance of the signal paths through the switch , differential switching , and slowing the risetime of the control pulse . With the 4016 , cutting the click can be as simple as putting 10K - 47K resistors in series with the control pins . Hope this helps at least get you started . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Dave Medin Phone : ( 205 ) 730-3169 ( w ) SSD -- Networking ( 205 ) 837-1174 ( h ) Intergraph Corp.

In addition , there is one school of thought that contends that oxidative stress rather than arylation of protein is the more critical factor in the hapatotoxcity of acetaminophen . As far as drug toxicities go , acetaminophen has and continues to be one of the most intensely scrutinized .

In general no-knock raids are to preserve evidence , like drugs , which can be flushed down the toilet . They are not the standard way to arrest a violent felon like a bank robber .

It is a very dangerous method to obtain evidence that might be destroyed if a warrant is served in the normal way . It is the most dangerous way to arrest anyone .

In the case of the BD 's , there was > almost definitely at most the paranoid delusion of deadly enimies who > would pretend to be cops . Cops are not cops _until_ they identify themselves as police officers . Most drug dealers and professional criminals are aware of the likelihood of arrest but they also know how the system works . If they are arrested they call their lawyer , post bail and hope for a plea bargain . If they pull a gun and shoot a cop during a raid they will be charged with first degree murder if they survive the raid . Drug dealers have guns for protection from their customers and other criminals , not to shoot cops . Cops are shot on no-knock drug raids because the criminals are n't aware that they are cops . No-knock raids on homes occupied by non-criminals are more likely to end in disaster . Mom and Pop citizen _KNOW_ that they have not committed any crime , they KNOW that anyone breaking into their house can not be a cop because they have done nothing wrong . If they have the means to defend themselves they may because they KNOW that the housebreakers are criminals not cops . Cops and homeowners may die . The first reports from Waco stated that the ATF had a warrant to search for illegal weapons and also an arrest warrant if the illegal weapons were found . In this case the no-knock warrant was not called for . It is difficult to flush a gun down the toilet . The ATF could have surrounded the compound . A marked police car could have driven up to the entrance and uniformed officers could have knocked and served the warrant usual way . It this had happened and and Koresh refused the warrant or drove the cops off at gun point then most of the t.p.g folks would have kept quiet . -- Rod Anderson N0NZO | `` I do not think the United States government Boulder , CO | is responsible for the fact that a bunch of rcanders @ nyx.cs.du.edu | fanatics decided to kill themselves '' satellite N0NZO on ao-16 | Slick Willie the Compassionate

The police would be entitled to subpoena documents relating to a specific matter , but any broad search such as implied by impounding all your records would be unconstitutional .

And that is where this sort of > discussion ultimately ends . Sorry , I put my foot in my mouth , concerning the church 's history . It is correct to say that the Council of Hippo 393 listed the deuterocanonical books among those accepted for use in the church , and that this was ratified by the Council of Carthage , and by Pope Innoent I and Gelasius I ( 414 AD ) . Yet Eerdman 's History of the Church says : '' At the end of the fourth century views still differed in regard to the extent of the canon , or the number of the books which should be acknowledged as divine and authoritative . The Jewish canon , or the Hebrew bible , was universally received , while the Apocrypha added to the Greek version of the Septuagint were only in a general way accounted as books suitable for church reading , and thus as a middle class between canonical and strictly apocryphal ( pseudonymous ) writings . And justly ; for those books , while they have great historical value , and fill the gap between the Old Testament and the New , all originated after the cessation of prophecy , and the can not be therefore regarded as inspired , nor are they ever cited by Christ or the aposteles . '' `` In the Western church the canon of both Testaments was closed at the end of the fourth century through the authority of Jerome ( who wavered , however , between critical doubts and the principle of tradition ) , and more especially of Augustine , who firmly followed the Alexandrian canon of the Septuagint , and the preponderant tradition in reference to the Catholic Epistles and the Revelation ; though he himself , in some places , inclines to consider the Old Testament Apocrypha as *deutero* canonical , bearing a subordinate authority . '' This history goes on to say that Augustine attended both the Council of Hippo and of Carthage . It is interesting to note , however , the following footnote to the fourth session of the Council of Trent . The footnote lists various Synods which endorsed lists of canonical books , but then says `` The Tridentine list or decree was the first *infallible* and effectually promulgated declaration on the Canon of the Holy Scriptures . '' Which leads one to think that the RC canon was not official until Trent . Thus my previous erroneous statement was not entirely groundless . It is also interesting to note that the Council of Trent went on to uphold `` the old Latin Vulgate Edition '' of the Scriptures as authentic . Which , I would suppose , today 's Catholic scholars wish the Council had never said . Also the council made no distinction between deutero-canonical and canonical books -- in contrast to ( Eerdman 's statement of ) the fourth century views . David Wagner a confessional Lutheran

Maybe they KNEW that the BDs were n't ANYWHERE NEAR as violent as the Feds ' spin doctors are trying to tell the public . Maybe they were AFRAID to try this kind of thing on the Crips and Bloods . Maybe it was because the ATF 's budget is up for approval and they seem to favor doing something dramatic whenever that is the case .

The one-time-pad yeilds ideal security , but has a well-known flaw in authentication . Suppose you use a random bit stream as the pad , and exclusive-or as the encryption operation . If an adversary knows the plaintext of a message , he can change it into any other message . Here 's how it works . Alice is sending Bob a plaintext P , under a key stream S Alice computes the ciphertext C = S xor P , and sends it to Bob . Eve knows the plainext P , but wants the message to appear as P ' . Eve intercepts C , and computes C ' = C xor P xor P ' = S xor P ' . Eve sends C ' to Bob . Bob decrypts C ' by computing C'xor S = P ' , thus receiving the false message which was substituted by Eve . Now the question is how can this attack be defeated with information theoretic security , not just computational security . Can we define something like `` ideal authentication '' which is the analog of ideal security . Can we obtain ideal authentication ? If not , how much can we limit Eve 's control over the message ? If we can achieve ideal authentication , does the solution use more key bits or expand the message ? Can we show the solution to be optimal in one or more parameters ? Does anyone know if these questions have been aswered before ? olson @ umbc.edu

I look forward to reading it . When I got to the library last week , it was with the object in view to look at some articles that have appeared over the last few years , since my previous look at the literature . Un- fortunately , they had moved the journal back-issues , so I did n't get a look at the articles I was hoping to find . I will continue to reserve my own judgment on _arsenokoitai_ until I have seen the latest scholarly work , and I can hope that REXLEX 's posting may give some meat to chew on . However , what I *can* do now , is to point out the methodological issues -- what needs to be shown for anything to be concluded in this matter . If the article REXLEX posts addresses these issues , so much the better ; if not , you will perhaps understand why the problem is hard . > James B. DeYoung writes , _in abstractu_ : > this study argues that Paul coined the term arsenokoitai , deriving it > from the LXX of Lev 20:12 ( cf . 18:22 ) and using it for homosexual > orientation and behavior [ it is only a minor point , but let me make it anyway ; De Young has already contradicted his own prior assertion in this abstract that the ancient analysis of these issues was concerned with actions and NOT with orientation . I doubt this will have much bearing on the article as such , but thought I should point it out from the start . ] The hypothesis De Young is advancing is that Paul a ) coined the word and b ) his intended meaning for it was in reference to the Levitical law . The questions I wish to raise are 1 . ) how would one go about confirming the truth of this hypothesis ? and 2 . ) what follows if one accepts ( or stipulates , for the sake of the discussion ) that it is correct ? Note that b ) is independent of a ) ; I consider b ) far more plausible than a ) , which seems merely to be a counsel of despair over finding nothing in the literature contemporary with Paul to clarify this word . So far as I know , Paul does NOT in general invent words anywhere else in his letters . Unless you have an otherwise-established pattern of coinages , it is *not* sound methodology to assume it -- particularly if he gives no hint in the immedi- ate text to `` fix '' the coinage 's meaning for his audience . As yet , the extract presents no evidence at all . What do we need to confirm or reject the hypothesis ? ( which , I should say at the outset , I find somewhat plausible ; I certainly know of nothing which makes it an *impossible* way of construing this problem passage . ) I 'm going to set aside for the moment the question of whether Paul might have coined this usage , to look at the more tractable question of what it means . For this there are , in principle , two kinds of evidence that can be adduced , internal and external . That is , we can look at the text of Paul 's letter for clarification or look outside that to prior or contemporary writings that Paul might have relied on , or to derivative writings that have some claim of access to Paul 's meaning . The single WORST problem with this word in Corinthians is that there IS no internal evidence for Paul 's meaning . He uses the word totally without an explanation or hint as to his meaning , save that its inclusion in a list of negatives implies that it has for him SOME negative meaning . We are left , as the only `` internal '' clue , with the etymology or formation of the word -- which is indeed the reason that De Young ( and others before him ) have associated it with the Leviticus prohibition of men VERBing with other men , where VERB is some standard euphemism for having sex ( `` lie '' in Leviticus , `` bed '' in Greek ) . One problem is that `` bedders '' ( _-koitai_ ) is not , as far as I know , USED that way in Greek . THEREFORE , I offer one serious test which de Young 's hypothesis *must* pass or be rejected : o find a body of Greek texts contemporary with Paul ( or not much prior to his day ) such that the _X-koitai_ formation implies `` men who have sex with X '' [ obviously , the `` best case '' is to find such usages of _arsenokoitai_ itself . ] such texts would be confirmation that the word *can* be read that way . It is worth emphasizing that compound words are NOT in general under- standable by projecting what the READER may imagine by the juxtaposition of the roots . Existence of such parallels does n't *prove* the hypothesis correct -- but it goes a long way towards making such a usage ( whether or not original with Paul in the specific case of X == _arse : n_ ) possible of comprehension by his readers . My `` test '' moves in the direction of external evidence . If Paul does NOT in his text explain his word ( and he does not ) , then he has to expect his readers to already know the word ( which stands against its being a coinage ) or to expect that it mimics word formations that they *do* know , such that they can guess his meaning without too much floundering . External evidence , that is , texts other than Paul 's own and lexicographic or social/historical considerations that might be adduced , then come into the picture . *If* there are other uses of the word , not dependent on Paul , which *have* sufficient internal ( contextual ) evidence -- or some gloss by a contemporary scribe -- to show a derogatory reference to male homosexu- ality , or similar _-koitai_ formations used in similar ways , *then* one has grounds for o denying that Paul coined the word and o assuming that his readers might understand his meaning Do you see the problem ? If Paul coined the word , then he REQUIRES his readers to share enough context with him to COMPREHEND his coinage and its intent -- in this case that they would ( stipulating De Young 's guess ) understand him to be referring to the Levitical `` universal '' prohibition of male-male sex ( this , mind you , in a context where Paul has emphasized at least to OTHER congregations ( and so one assumes to the Corinthians -- how else to explain 1 Cor . 6:12 , and the Corinthians having to be pulled back from overinterpreting their freedom ? ) the NON applicability of Torah law to his gentile converts ! ) Among the considerations that make it implausible for Paul to have coined the word , its first element is archaic -- _arse : n_ is an old Attic or Ionic form of what in even classical ( let alone koine ) times would be assimilated as _arre : n_ . To me , this implies that we are even more than usually needful of external evidence to pin down meaning and usage . What is Paul doing inventing a word in obsolete Attic formation ? And if he *didn't* coin the word , but picked it up like the others in his list as common terms of derogation , then his meaning will be -- for his readers -- constrained by that common meaning ( since he gives no other . ) I can not emphasize enough that Paul DOES NOT TELL US what he means by this word . We ( and his original readers ) are guessing . They , at least , had a contemporary context -- and maybe Paul had used this very word and explained it in great detail to them in person . But we have no trace of evidence of that , and to *suppose* it is mere fantasy . So -- we are *desperately* in need of external evidence about this word . And it seems to be exceptionally meagre . That is precisely the problem . I can think of several more or less equally plausible hypotheses about the word : a ) it was a standard gutter term of abuse for ( some or all , maybe very specific , maybe very general ) homosexual male activities b ) it was a term of abuse used by Jews about the awful homosexual Greeks ( which may or may not be consciously associated on their part with the Leviticus passage ) c ) Paul invented the term -- and again there may or may not be an association with Leviticus in his doing so . He may or may not intend the word to have an explicit and universal application with absolute and clear boundaries . [ Since none of his OTHER words in that list have such character , this last seems to me about the *least* plausible of the hypotheses I 'm advancing . ] Of these , I 'd say off the top of my head that a ) is most plausible -- but I still have reservations about that , too . If the word NEVER appears before Paul , and in later uses has some evidence of depending on Paul , then one can opt for Paul 's coining it . If it does appear before him , he might *still* have coined it being unaware of prior use ( in which case , his coinage is inherently confusing ! ) but one should normally demote c ) on the basis of any earlier uses ( especially if they can be shown to have been at all common in the places Paul traveled . ) In either of the a ) or b ) cases , one has to take into account Paul 's relation to the community of usage he picked the word up from -- and whether it be from the Greek or Jewish communities , Paul 's relations are hardly straight- forward ! There is , so far as I have yet seen , little or no external evidence to aid us in selecting one of these ( or some other ) hypothesis . Your guess is as good as mine ( or maybe worse or maybe better , depending on a lot of things ) . But it remains -- so far -- guesswork . And I do n't know about you , but I for one WILL NOT equate human guesswork with the will of God . By all means be convinced in your own conscience about what Paul is getting at -- as he says elsewhere on what was in HIS day a major controversy of somewhat this same character ( Romans 14:22-23 ) '' Hold on to your own belief , as between yourself and God -- and consider the man fortunate who can make his decision without going against his conscience . But anybody who eats in a state of doubt is condemned , because he is not in good faith , and every act done in bad faith is a sin . '' For my part , I can not see any way to resolve Paul 's meaning in the use of _arsenokoitai_ without directly applicable external evidence -- and by the nature of such external evidence , it will never reach to certainty of constraining Paul 's own intent . Paul , like Humpty Dumpty ( and me , and all the rest of us ) *will* use words in ways that are personal choices -- and sometimes leave his readers puzzled . If that puzzlement leads you to God , it may be blessed -- if it should lead away ( as some of Paul's words HAVE led some people ) , then Paul 's intense communicative effort to contrive his meaning in our souls may have some regretable consequences . I have always found Paul to be a fantastically reliable guide -- if I read him `` in the large '' , if I can see him lay out his position in detail and hammer it home time and time again . I am much less certain about his meaning in his many brief and cryptic passages ( such as this one . ) In my usual discursive way , I have gone on at great length about the first of my intended meta-exegetical points -- what would be needed to confirm that Paul a ) coined or b ) in any case meant the word to mean the same as the Leviticus prohibition . My second point is to *stipulate* this hypo- thesis , and follow up what it implies for both his initial readers and for later Christians .

Henderson is the best leadoff hitter of all-time , arguably . Winfield has meant more to his team than Henderson . Unlike daryll , henderson tries hard . He is an amazing centerfielder . Rickey is VERY good , maybe better than winfield , I was angry at the dissing of winfield . Though Winfield has been better than henderson lately . Check the numbers , winfield may surprise you . He will have 3000 basehits , and should have 500 homeruns when he retires ( wishful thiniking if he plays to 45 )

[ munch following is reformatted ] > It does sound funny , I will admit . But for me it is true . Windows > crashed on > all of the time ( and from what I have read in PC Mag , this is not > the exception ) I 'd say that the massive crash problems are exceedingly rare . Windows _itself_ almost never crashes , but it can be crashed by an errant application ( My personal favorite ? Any one of the Corel 3.0 programs ) . On the other hand , I have had OS/2 crash randomly a number of times , mostly just running it 's own applications . For instance . Today I discovered a new one . While I was downloading with Procomm Plus For Windows ( running seamless with the standard VGA drivers on a run-o ' da mill VGA card -- 640x480 ) , I decided that I wanted to edit a copy of a quote that I wanted to add to my .finger . But since I 've learned not to really trust seamless , I fired up a full screen WinOS/23.1 session . Whoops , the download finished while WinOS/2 was loading . It had _just_ gotten the pointer up , so I hit alt-escape to get back t the desktop ( I have a lot of fonts , so loading takes a good long while ) . Blam . Screen trashed , Procomm hangs up . Hm . Well , I can sorta see the mouse , so I clicked on the minimized WINOS/2 session and got back my fullscreen Windows session ( but the color were off -- red and green and yellow and brown instead of blues and greys ) . So I closed this , and got back to the desktop ( now fully restored ) . PP+ was still sitting , window open , but it was no longer '' connected '' to the com port -- so I exited it ( the normal way -- it told me I was still online and it would hang up , though it was _already_ hung up ) . Hm . Well , load anothe -- no , bad idea . Shutdown and reboot . Ok , refresh first.. Now , shutdown . Yes , everything is closed ... Hm . Nothing seems to be happening . Let 's see.. Ah , the windows list still comes up . OK , let 's try shutdown again . No go . Huh . Alright , wait 60 seconds to see if it 's just running slow . Hmm . Still seems to be running OS/2 . Try shutdown again . Nothing . Oh well . Reboot . Enjoy the checkdisk time . In this case , a part of the OS crashed not only itself , but OS/2 entirely ( which is n't even smart enough to tell when it ; s been compromised , I guess ) . In everyday ( specifically _today_ ) use . > OS/2 gives each windows app a VDM and they ca n't touch each other or > ( generally ) anything they are n't supposed to have . That 's the idea , anyway . In truth , when a program crashes on OS/2 , it will bring the system down with it . The programs that would just GPF under Windows do the same under OS/2 , but programs that are fine under DOS and Windows bring OS/2 screaming to a halt , task protection or no . For instance , I 'm still wondering why print preview in a windowed WP 5.1 ( DOS ) locks up my system . It works fine under DOS or even in a dos box under Windows 3.1 . ( Admittedly , it does n't crash if I run WP51 full screen , but the first time this bug big me , it bit hard ) . > If windows works for you , > then great . Maybe this is why some people do n't see why OS/2 is the OS of > choice . If windows does n't crash on you , and you do n't mind waiting on each > task , Please explain . The only time I wait on anything under Windows is when I 'm copying or formatting a floppy , or when printing ( and even then , not long -- I get 9 to 11 pages dumped to the printman per minute , and can _still_ go do things -- slowly -- while it 's doing this -- I 've downloaded with PP+ @ 9600 while printing ) . > and not being able to adress your memory better than DOS , Not sure what you mean here . OS/2 sees 16 megs , uses 5 or six of these for it 's own use ( more if you want to count WinOS/2 ) . Windows sees 16 megs , uses 3 or 4 ( more like 5 if you count the disk cache as I am for OS/2 ) for itself . If memory efficiency were a big issue , PC GEOS would be the current king of the Intel desktop . > some of the > key reasons for using OS/2 are gone . I probably would still use it , but it > would be more of an even fight . On the other hand.. I am finally able to say with some confidence that both OS/2 and Windows have a bit of hardware sensitivity to them . For instance , the machine I am sitting at runs both fine , while the machine next to me constantly locks up under Windows . ( But ran OS/2 without a hitch once I got it through a 5-crash install ) . On the whole , I 'd say OS/2 is a whole lot more sensitive than Windows , but there are ( I suppose ) machines that Windows just does n't like . > Wittism of th week : `` I think that it 's wrong to believe in an ism , you should > believe in yourself '' Ferrish Bueller Was n't this _Ferris_ Bueller ? -- There are stupid laws , and then there are stupider than normal laws .

No , it 's not true . You can get SCSI and IDE to work together , but there are restrictions ( at least with the Adaptec 1542 ) : * You MUST boot from the IDE drive .

Will there be a noticable > decrease in access time/increase in Xfer rate ? For MSDOS applications , ISA-based SCSI and IDE controllers generally have comparable throughput . You might get slightly higher throughput with a SCSI disk , but you 'll also pay more for the disk ( $ 30- $ 100 and up , in some cases ) . You 'll also pay much , much more for a good SCSI controller . Note that good SCSI controllers really show their power if they're used with a good multitasking operating system ( like a PC Unix ) . Unfortunately , neither MSDOS nor Windows 3.1 is a good multitasking operating system . The performance advantage of SCSI controllers is mostly wasted with these , which leaves the advantage of being able to connect multiple devices to the SCSI bus as the only advantage . However , note that you can expect to pay a premium for SCSI devices . If you 're only going to be using MSDOS , stick with IDE . It's cheaper , and you 'll have less headaches . > 4 ) Will virtually any SCSI device chain into the controller for my > hard-drive ( bernoulli box , CD-rom , Tape Drive , etc ) . [ Note : the following is true for MSDOS/Windows only . Who knows what the future holds for Windows NT and Unix ? ? ? ] No . Generally , you have to find drivers for each SCSI device , which probably do n't exist unless you 're using one of the `` better '' / '' high performance '' SCSI controllers . These are typically bus-mastering SCSI controllers that cost around $ 180- $ 400 ( street prices ) and up , and drivers that allow you to connect these controllers to popular name-brand SCSI devices either come with the card , or can be purchased ( for under $ 100 list price ) . Examples of such driver kits are : * Adaptec 's EZ SCSI kit ( list : $ 75 ) . This works only with Adaptec SCSI controllers . * CorelSCSI ! ( from the same people who make CorelDRAW ! ) ( list : $ 99 ( ? ) ) . This driver kit will supposedly work with any SCSI controller card that has an ASPI driver , like the Adaptec . Central Point 's PC Tools for DOS 8.0 supports a number of SCSI tape drives ( the documentation lists 40 tape drives ) . Unfortunately , it works only with Adaptec controllers . > 5 ) Are there likely to be other problems/incompatibilities with a > SCSI controller and sound cards/video accelerators/and similar > equipment . Yes , you will run into problems , if you 're using a high-performance , bus-mastering SCSI controller . This does n't sound right , does n't it ? It 's true , though . With one of these controllers , you 'll probably have to tweak your system to get it to work with sound cards , floppy-controller-based tape drives ( like the CMS Jumbo 250 ) , and Windows 3.1 . I know . I 've been to h*ll and back getting my SCSI controller to work with various hardware/software ( thank God for tape backups ) . If you want a copy of my `` Adaptec 1542 hints and tips '' file , send email . These problems are n't really the fault of the SCSI controller card ; the problems are really with the general hardware and software design of the PC ( e.g. , no standards ) . However , adding a bus-mastering SCSI card is what brings these problems to the surface and makes them visible . SCSI holds a lot of promise , but you can run into a lot of PC compatibility problems . If you 're planning on using only MSDOS/Windows 3.1 , stick with IDE . If you want to use Windows NT or a PC Unix , you'll have to make some hard decisions : a good SCSI controller and more than one SCSI hard disk will probably give you excellent performance , at the possible cost of MSDOS compatibility . [ I say , `` probably '' , because , while I know this to be true with a PC Unix , I do n't know if this really will be true of Windows NT . I suspect that it will , but I do n't know for sure . ]

For example , in chemistry someone may predict | > the outcome of a chemical reaction and then actually observe that reaction | > repeatedly . There are several problems here . First , you are discussing only experimental procedures . Observational procedures are also useful . The main criterion is attempting to verify an idea by using it to make prediction about as-yet unmade observations . The observations could be the result of an experiment , or they could be obsevations of activity occuring spontaneossly in nature , or they could even be observations of the lasting results of events long past . All that matters is that the observations be *new* . This is what prediction is about in science - it is *not* about predicting the future except in this very restricted sense . Secondly , repeatability can also take many forms . It is really just the requirement that independent observers be able to verify the results . The observation of a fossil is 'repeatable ' , since any qualified observer may look at it ( this is why the specimens are reqtined in a museum ) . Also , there is the implicit prediction that future fossil finds will correspond to the current one . New fossils are found often enough that this is tested regularly . Many times a new fossil actually falsifies some conclusion made on the basis of previous fossils . Unfortunately for you , the models that were falsified have alway been peripheral to the model of evolution we now have . ( For instance , the front legs of Tyrannosaurus rex turned out to have tremendous muscles , rather than being weakly endowed as previously believed ) . So , in fact , histoircal science findings *are* repeatable in the necessary sense . Just becuase you can not go out and repeat the original event does *not* make it impossible to make valid observations .

Now lets apply our `` hate the sin ... '' philosophy and see > what happens . If we truly hate the sin , then the more we see it , the > stronger our hatred of it will become . Eventually this hate becomes so > strong that we become disgusted with the sinner and eventually come to > hate the sinner . That has not been my experience . I 've not found myself hating anybody as a result of hating the sin that may be in their life . As a sinner myself , I find myself having more compassion for the person . Jesus too , since the Bible teaches that he was tempted in every way that we are , is able to have compassion on us when we our tempted and fall . Jesus is our very example of HOW to hate the sin but love the sinner . In the account of the woman caught in adultery ( John 8 ) , Jesus had compassion on the woman ; BUT he also called her to leave her life of sin . This is what it means to love sinners but hate their sin ; it means loving them unconditionally , while at the same time calling them to leave their sin . > In addition , our hatred of the sin often causes us to say and do things > which are taken personally by the sinner ( who often does not even believe > what they are doing is a sin ) . The blame for this can not always be laid at the feet of the Christian . I have seen and been guilty of taking offense by someone merely pointing out my sin and calling me to repent of it . It was not unloving for the Christian to call me out of sin ; in fact , I believe it was the most loving thing that that person could have done . He loved me enough to want to spare me the consequence of remaining in my sin . > After enough of this , the sinner begins to hate us ( they certainly don't > love us for our constant criticism of their behavior ) . Hate builds up and > drives people away from God ... this certainly can not be a good way to build > love . Again , I do n't think that you can lay the blame for this at the feet of the Christian . If we have loved them as Jesus loved sinners ( exemplified in John 8 ) and the sinner hates us for it , then we have done the best we can . We will have extended to them the most perfect expression of love and they will have rejected it . Now it we hate the sin but forget to love the sinner , then indeed , we will , ourselves , be in sin . > In the summary of the law , Christ commands us to love God and to love our > neighbors . He does n't say anything about hate . I would like to encourage you to do a word study on HATE in the New Testament . I really think that you will be surprised . > In fact , if anything , he commands us to save our criticisms for ourselves . Criticism is very different from calling a sinner to repent .

From : mussack @ austin.ibm.com ( Christopher Mussack ) Subject : Re : Dreams and out of body incidents Lines : 26 Ever since I was a kid and learned to tell when I was in a dream I have used my dreams for fantasies or working out problems . In my dreams I have done everything from yell at my mom to machine-gunning zombies , not to mention myriad sexual fantasies . I have deliberately done things that I would never do in real life . I understand the need to control ones thoughts , but I always felt that dreams were format free , no morals , no ethics , no physical laws , ( though sometimes I would have to wake myself up to go to the bathroom . ) Is this an incorrect attitude ? Rather than weakening my inhibitions , I could argue that I got certain things `` out of my system '' by experiencing them in dreams . By analyzing a dream I can determine if I have a problem with a certain situation , i.e . in a dream something will be exagerated that I can then contemplate and see if it really bothers me or not . I ca n't believe that other people do n't do the same . It seems silly to attach moral significance to dreams . I think that this is entirely different from out of body experiences , which I have never had . Contradictions welcome . Chris Mussack

[ PTS ] -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- [ PTS ] [ PTS ] [ PTS ] The Conflict Over Nagorno-Karabakh : An Azeri Perspective [ PTS ] -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- [ PTS ] By Alec Rasizade [ PTS ] [ PTS ] [ AR ] Western readers have learned of the Nagorno ( Upper ) Karabakh [ AR ] controversy through reports from that remote area by Western [ AR ] correspondents and from commentaries by member of the long-established [ AR ] Armenian-American community . Azeri views on this dispute have [ AR ] appeared rarely if at all in the Western news media . Therefore let me [ AR ] present _Washington Report_ readers with some basic truths about the [ AR ] origins of the conflict . During the past two years , if one reads all the commentaries on the subject , a small minority of the writers have been Armenia or Azeri . The following should be interesting . [ AR ] Armenian leaders claim that Azerbaijan was the first to oppress and [ AR ] expel the Armenian minority from the Azerbaijani Republic . Actually , [ AR ] the initiative to banish the Azeri minority and convert the Armenian [ AR ] Republic into a homogeneous state began in the winter of 1987-1988 , [ AR ] when 165,000 Azeris were driven out of Armenia . Following that move , [ AR ] there were massacres of Armenians in the Azerbaijani cities of Sumgait [ AR ] in February 1988 and two years later , in Baku in January 1990 . This not true . Other than simply checking the newspapers , I will quote from an independent human rights report . In the _PAX Cristi Netherlands_ , 29 September 1991 , page 28 , we read : `` By mid-november , many incidents took place in several places in Azerbaijan . The APF [ Azeri Popular Front ] challenged the Communist Party for power . ... After ten days , the authorities came in with tanks to reimpose their power . In Nakhitchevan , the last Armenian villages were deported . In Ganja , Armenians were attacked and killed . All 40,000 Armenian inhabitants fled the city ... '' Between 22 November and 8 December 1988 , refugees from Ganja arrived in Armenia while all 167,000 Azeris in Armenia were chased away . '' In this part of the world February 1988 [ start of organized anti-Armenian pogroms in Azerbaijan ] come before November and December of 1988 ! [ AR ] Azeri parliamentary committees have compiled evidence indicating that [ AR ] both events were inspired from Moscow to secure Russian imperial rule [ AR ] in the Transcaucasus , according to the Roman principle of `` divide and [ AR ] rule . '' Similar conspiracies are evident throughout the five-year [ AR ] history of the conflict . It is interesting that the Azeris killed , burnt , raped the Armenians but the perpetrators blame Russians , and Armenians themselves on other occasions . [ AR ] Each time the parties have been about to reach an agreement ( in [ AR ] Zheleznovodsk , Moscow , Tehran , Rome , Geneva and Alma-Ata ) , an [ AR ] invisible hand provoked further bloodshed . Those interested in [ AR ] maintaining the Azeri-Armenian conflict , as well as the Georgian [ AR ] turmoil , are imperialist forces in Russia , and probably in Iran . Incorrect ! When were the people of Nagorno-Karabakh ever involved in an agreement ? Never . Until Azerbaijan sits down with the Armenians of Nagorno- Karabakh there will never be an end to this conflict . [ AR ] The Armenian offensive last spring created more than 100,000 new Azeri [ AR ] refugees from the captured towns of Upper and Lower Karabakh and [ AR ] adjacent rural districts . Today 500,000 Azeri refugees throng the [ AR ] city of Baku and environs , providing more problems for the newly [ AR ] elected Popular Front government , which is opposed by the rigidly [ AR ] nationalistic National Independence Party . It 's called war . If the Azerbaijanis did n't try to deport and allow the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh to live in their ways , keep their Armenian culture , these Armenians would not have had to defend their existence . The Azeris should not have assumed that Armenians were going to roll over and play dead . [ AR ] How can a Western-style democracy survive in a small Muslim country [ AR ] where 1 million of the 7 million inhabitants are unemployed ? In the [ AR ] absence of any international effort to help Azeri refugees , as Kurdish [ AR ] and Bosnian refugees have been helped , how can the Azeri government [ AR ] reject the demand of these exiles to recapture their lands , homes and [ AR ] possessions ? The Azeri government should have thought about such thnings before they attempted to deprive Armenians of `` lands , homes , and possessions '' . [ AR ] Such simple realities must be understood in the West . [ AR ] Misunderstanding Caucasian politics leads both Western and Russian [ AR ] public opinion to imagine a permanent , and therefore irreversible , [ AR ] ethnic and religious rivalry in the Caucasus . True , and you , Dr. Alec Rasizade , should practice what you preach ! [ AR ] I think Western reluctance to interfere derives from this idea . [ AR ] Meanwhile , continuation of the war could draw both Eastern and Western [ AR ] states into the conflict through activation of various security [ AR ] alliances . These include , on the Armenian side , the Moscow-led [ AR ] Commonwealth forces under the Tashkent mutual security pact , signed [ AR ] May 15 , 1992 . On the Azeri side , should Turkey get involved as the [ AR ] guarantor of the Nakhichevan autonomy through the Kars Treaty of Oct. [ AR ] 13 , 1921 , these include the North Atlantic Treaty forces . Western interference ! Turkish intervention ! The moment Turkey dares step into this conflict it will close the doors of any chance of Turkey being part of Europe ( as if it ever will ) and will destroy the eastern third of Anatolia ! Dr. Rasizade , international realpolitik is not as simple-minded as you would have us believe . [ AR ] Upper Karabakh generally is described in Western press reports as an [ AR ] '' Armenian enclave within Azerbaijan . '' The truth is that the Armenians [ AR ] began to appear there only in the middle of the last century . Incorrect once again . A brief scan of history addresses such a foolish claim . Armenians today , refer to the area of Nagorno-Karabakh as `` Artsakh '' , which comes from the Urartian term `` Urtekhe-Urtekhini '' . NO Azeris yet ! Ancient Greeks referred to Artsakh as `` Orkhistena '' . NO Azeris yet ! In the first half of the 6th century B.C. , Artsakh , as part of Ervandid Armenia of Media . NO Azeris yet ! From the end of the 4th century B.C. , Artsakh was part of the Armenian Kingdom of Ervan . NO Azeris yet ! Artsakh was still part of the Armenian Empire of Tigran . Orkhistena , or Artsakh is refereed to by Strabo , as part of Armenia . NO Azeris yet ! After Armenia was divided between the Persian and Byzantine Empires in 387 A.D. until 428 , Artsakh was part of Armenia . NO Azeris yet ! End of the 5th century , Utik and Artsakh became principalities of the Aranshakhiks . NO Azeris yet ! By the 7th century an Artsakh dialect of Armenian formed . NO Azeris yet ! Emperor Konstantin ( 913-959 ) addressees a letter to the Prince of Khachen `` To Armenia '' . Khachen was the central principality of Artsakh . NO Azeris yet ! In the decree of Paul I ( 1797 ) , the number of Armenian families in this area was stated as 11,000 . It was from the 16th to the 18th centuries that non-Armenians from Central Asia , Asia Minor , and Kurdistan first began to be exercise political influence in the planes of Artsakh . Caucasian Muslims around Karabakh ! In 1813 Karabagh becomes part of Russia . Officiallt part of Russia 1828 . Some Muslims in Karabakh ! In 1914 , the number of Armenian churches in Nagorno-Karabagh was 224 , 188 priests , 206,768 parishioners in 224 Armenian towns and villages . The Armenian percentage of the population was over 90 % . MAX : 10 % Azeris in Karabakh -- assuming no Kurds ! Consider the following statement by the Azerbaijani Revcom on December 1 , 1920 : `` The Worker-Peasant Government of Azerbaidzan , having been informed of the proclamation of Armenia a Soviet Socialist Republic , sends its greetings to the brother people . From this day the previous boundaries between Armenia and Azerbaidzan are annulled . Nagornyi Karabakh , Zangezur , and Nakhichevan are recognized as integral parts of the Armenian Socialis Republic . Long live the brotherhood and union of the workers and peasants of Soviet Armenia and Azerbaidzan ! Chairman of the Revcom of Azerbaidzan N. Narimanov People 's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Guseinov '' [ AR ] A few years ago they celebrated the 150th anniversary of their [ AR ] resettlement from Persia to Karabakh , after it came under Russian [ AR ] rule . No , incorrect . The 1988 celebration was the 150th anniversary of Russian rule in the Caucasus , including Karabakh ! [ AR ] At the same time the Russian colonial administration also drew [ AR ] in Russian and German settlers , who were welcomed by Azeris . How [ AR ] would Americans react if the large numbers of Armenians living in [ AR ] southern California suddenly claimed an Armenian homeland , and [ AR ] demanded separation from California ? Non-sequitur . [ AR ] Armenian historians insist that before the Armenian resettlement [ AR ] Karabakh was inhabited by aboriginal Christians . That is correct . Armenian historians do n't say this ! [ AR ] The people of medieval Caucasian Albania adopted Christianity in the [ AR ] fourth century . But those ancient residents had no link to and [ AR ] nothing in common with Armenians . Considering the Caucasian Albans were of the Armenian Apostolic faith , and their utilization of the Armenian language in their liturgy , makes such an argument totally invalid ! [ AR ] Azeris would have a better claim to [ AR ] be successors of Albania , since Azeris have for centuries inhabited , [ AR ] dominated , and developed the Karabakh part of the Azeri nation . Wishing to be part of a people non-existent for nearly a millennium for geo- political advantage is rather outrageous . In addition to such absurdity , Azeris claim to be Turks , Persians , and all the while are Azerizing their minorities , such as the Lezgians , Kurds , Tat , Talish , and a host of other nationalities which may amount to nearly half the population of Azerbaijan . [ AR ] Both Armenia and Azerbaijan last year signed the Final Act of the [ AR ] Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe of 1975 , and the [ AR ] Paris Charter for New Europe of 1990 , confirming their mutual [ AR ] adherence to the principle of inviolability of existing borders . This [ AR ] principle means that the borders and territorial integrity of the [ AR ] Republic of Azerbaijan are to be guaranteed by all of the signatory [ AR ] nations , not just by Turkey . Such agreements do not give Azerbaijan the right to de-populate Karabakh of Armenians . [ AR ] This is one key to intervention on behalf either of the U.N. , the [ AR ] CSCE , the Commonwealth , NATO or Iran . The second key to untying the [ AR ] Caucasian knot is to determine who is the aggressor , according to the [ AR ] U.N. definition of 1974 . Fine , so why has Azerbaijan refused to allow UN troops into the Armenian enclave ? What is Azerbaijan afraid of ? Perhaps the fact that the territory is the home of Armenians , the UN , would by definition , support the local population ! [ AR ] When that is accomplished , the international community can and should [ AR ] apply to the aggressor in the Caucasus international sanctions such as [ AR ] those presently being employed against Serbia and Montenegro in the [ AR ] former Yugoslavia . Such decisive collective international action can [ AR ] halt further aggression in Karabakh , and prevent the Armenian-Azeri [ AR ] conflict from growing and spreading . Azerbaijan 's refusal to allow the Armenians of Karabakh to determine their own future the is issue , not viewing isolating events out of context are actions that will address the Karabakh conflict . Viewing events in a war in isolation and out of context is like viewing the landing at Normandy as an act of Allied aggression !

Be careful here ... the > problem is n't the rich but the values and the systems that make the rich > rich . But the `` values and systems that make the rich rich '' all basically amount to freedom of choice . In New England in 1800 the entire economy was based on the small family farm . Farm economy households were economically diversified , producing not only agricultural goods but also `` manufactured '' goods , especially cloth . Many farm women carded , spun , and/or wove , producing not only cloth for their own family but also to sell , generating extra income . But about this time the Industrial Revolution was underway in England and by the 1820 's it had moved to the US , in both cases in the form of textile mills . These mills could produce cloth far more efficiently and cheaply than people at home . The result was that an important source of home income was wiped out and many of these women were compelled by economic circumstance to go to work in these same mills in Lowell , Mass , or Nashua , NH , where they worked 73 hour weeks in deafening , dangerous conditions , living regimented lives and being exposed to cotton-dust and infectious dis- eases due to the work . Now people did n't *HAVE* to buy the cheaper factory-made cloth . They were free to keep buying the home-made variety and support their local economy . . . > Things are designed in such a way that in order to go with the system > and make money , everything ELSE we care about goes to shit . . . . but ( sorry for the cliche ) , `` it takes two to tango '' . The big rich corporations achieved that wealth because we buy their stuff . It used to be the case that the business center of a town was also its social center . You KNEW the merchants you did business with or even local kids working behind the counter . You would see people on the street whom you knew and you could stop for a chat . Nowadays local merchants are going out of business and people shop at huge anonymous malls serving regional populations of hundreds of thousands or millions . You have no particular relationship with the companies you do business with , and feel no particular commitment to them , nor they to you . Major components of what defines a `` com- munity '' have been destroyed . On the other hand the products we buy at these malls are a lot cheaper due to economies of scale and foreign manufacture , and they are probably of better , or at least more consistent , quality . > I have to > constantly remind myself that the goal of human society is not to make > money .

I only hope enough evidence can be garnered to get a conviction . I am not certain what you mean by the `` fundy '' part as the term fundamentalist has a wide variety of uses . If you refer to those who actually believe Jesus is the Messiah and Son of God and wish to follow in his way , then I plead guilty . But what does it matter what I think . The Roman circus is over . The lions have been satisfied -- for now . The Emperor , after the long and gruelling struggle , sensed the crowd was tiring and gave thumbs down . With respect to my previous comments about David Koresh , I urge you to re-examine my previous posts . I believe you mistakenly assume that defense of Koresh ' right to his own personal beliefs and his right to express them to others implies agreement with Koresh' theology . Actually I understand little about the details of Branch- Davidian teachings and regret so many are hung-up on that aspect of the tragic events of the past few days . Nor do I think Koresh ' sex life should be of any interest to the federal government . Of course Hillary says he had been molesting infants so it must be true even though such allegations do not fall under the jurisdiction of the federal government ; they are state and local matters and have been thoroughly reviewed at the local level by proper authorities with no successful charge having ever been levied against him . Under American law , he was innocent as Americans are presumed innocent until proven guilty . At least that 's how it is suppposed to be . But he was demonized and propa- gandized against by a powerful machine to have him appear as a lustful beast and therefore deserving of every ill the fates might bring upon him . But evidence trickles in that the twenty-one children , who left the building in the early days of the siege , were carefully examined by qualified authorities for evidence of physical or sexual abuse and none was found . DeGuerin , one of the attorneys who met with Davidians several times before the conflagration , reported that the children seemed well adjusted and showed no sign of abuse . Ultimately , Steve , what I think about the heart of David Koresh is quite unimportant . Today he is in the benevolent hands of a most wise and merciful judge who will one day surely judge us all . So I withhold any judgment of David Koresh and defer to the One who has all knowledge . Meanwhile , let 's clean up the mess left on earth and keep this from happening again by sending a strong message to the government to respect the inalienable rights of the people it serves . -- Joe Gaut > > ( I remain deliberately neutral on the cause of the fire : I wouldn't > put it past Koresh to have torched the place himself .

If I had to choose , I 'd much > rather have the persistant type . Being a chronic HBsAg carrier does not necessarily mean the patient has chronic persistent anything . Persons who are chronic carriers may have no clinical , biochemical , or histologic evidence of liver disease , or they may have chronic persistent hepatitis , chronic active hepatitis , cirrhosis , or hepatocellular carcinoma . Most cases of chronic persistent hepatitis ( CPH ) are probably the result of a viral infection , although in a good number of cases the cause can not be determined . The diagnosis of CPH is made on the basis of liver biopsy . It consists of findings of portal inflammation , an intact periportal limiting plate , and on occasion isolated foci of intralobular necrosis . But in contrast to chronic active hepatitis ( CAH ) there is no periportal inflammation , bridging necrosis , or fibrosis . CPH has , indeed , an excellent prognosis . If I had to choose between CAH and CPH there is no question I would also choose CPH . However , as David pointed out , the distinction between the two is not as neat as some of us would have it . The histology can sometimes be pretty equivocal , with biopsies showing areas compatible with both CPH and CAH . Maybe it is a sampling problem . Maybe it is a continuum . I do n't know . ================================= Howard Doyle doyle+ @ pitt.edu

Thanks . I get regular questions about gamma correction since I go to great pains to deal with it properly in xli ( the image loader program I maintain ) . Here is an explanation I often use to answer these questions . This might be suitable for inclusion in the FAQ .

Gill graeme @ labtam.oz.au Date : 93/5/16 '' What is all this gamma stuff anyway ? '' -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Although it would be nice to think that `` an image is an image '' , there are a lot of complications . Not only are there a whole bunch of different image formats ( gif , jpeg , tiff etc etc ) , there is a whole lot of other technical stuff that makes dealing with images a bit complicated . Gamma is one of those things . If you 've ever downloaded images from BBS or the net , you 've probably noticed ( with most image viewing programs ) that some images look ok , some look too dark , and some look too light . `` Why is this ? '' you may ask . This , is gamma correction ( or the lack of it ) . Why do we need gamma correction at all ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Gamma correction is needed because of the nature of CRTs ( cathode ray tubes - the monitors usually used for viewing images ) . If you have some sort of real live scene and turn it into a computer image by measuring the amount of light coming from each point of the scene , then you have created a `` linear '' or un-gamma-corrected image . This is a good thing in many ways because you can manipulate the image as if the values in the image file were light ( ie . adding and multiplying will work just like real light in the real world ) . Now if you take the image file and turn each pixel value into a voltage and feed it into a CRT , you find that the CRT _doesn't_ give you an amount of light proportional to the voltage . The amount of light coming from the phosphor in the screen depends on the the voltage something like this : Light_out = voltage ^ crt_gamma So if you just dump your nice linear image out to a CRT , the image will look much too dark . To fix this up you have to `` gamma correct '' the image first . You need to do the opposite of what the CRT will do to the image , so that things cancel out , and you get what you want . So you have to do this to your image : gamma_corrected_image = image ^ ( 1/crt_gamma ) For most CRTs , the crt_gamma is somewhere between 1.0 and 3.0 . If that is all it is , why does it seem so complicated ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - The problem is that not all display programs do gamma correction . Also not all sources of images give you linear images ( Video cameras or video signals in general ) . Because of this , a lot of images already have some gamma correction done to them , and you are rarely sure how much . If you try and display one of those images with a program that does gamma correction for you , the image gets corrected twice and looks way to light . If you display one of those images with a program that does n't do gamma correction , then it will look vaguely right , but not perfect , because the gamma correction is not exactly right for you particular CRT . Whose fault is all this ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - It is really three things . One is all those display programs out there that do n't do gamma correction properly . Another is that most image formats do n't specify a standard gamma , or do n't have some way or recording what their gamma correction is . The third thing is that not many people understand what gamma correction is all about , and create a lot of images with varying gamma 's . At least two file formats do the right thing . The Utah Graphics Toolkit .rle format has a semi-standard way of recording the gamma of an image . The JFIF file standard ( that uses JPEG compression ) specifies that the image to be encoded must have a gamma of 1.0 ( ie . a linear image - but not everyone obeys the rules ) . Some image loaders ( for instance xli - an X11 image utility ) allow you to specify not only the gamma of the monitor you are using , but the individual gamma values of image you are trying to view . Other image viewers ( eg . xv another X11 image program ) and utilities ( eg . the pbm toolkit ) provide ways of changing the gamma of an image , but you have to figure out the overall gamma correction yourself , allowing for undoing any gamma correction the image has , and then the gamma correction you need to suite your CRT monitor . [ Note that xv 2.21 does n't provide an easy way of modifying the gamma of an image . You need to adjust the R , G and B curves to the appropriate gamma in the ColEdit controls . Altering the Intensity in the HSV controls does n't do the right thing , as it fails to take account of the effect gamma has on H and S. This tends to give a tint to the image . ] How can I figure out what my viewer does , or what gamma my screen has ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - The simplest way to do that is to try loading the file chkgamma.jpg ( provided with xli distribution ) , which is a JFIF jpeg format file containing two grayscale ramps . The ramps are chosen to look linear to the human eye , one using continuous tones , and the other using dithering . If your viewer does the right thing and gamma corrects images , then the two ramps should look symmetrical , and the point at which they look equally bright should be almost exactly half way from the top to the bottom . ( To find this point it helps if you move away a little from the screen , and de-focus your eyes a bit . ) If your viewer does n't do gamma correction , then left hand ramp will have a long dark part and a short white part , and the point of equal brightness will be above the center . If your viewer does have a way of setting the right amount of gamma correction for a display , then if the equal brightness point is above center increase the gamma , and decrease it if it is below the center . The value will usually be around 2.2 [ with xli for instance , you can adjust the display gamma with the -dispgamma flag , and once you 've got it right , you can set the DISPLAY_GAMMA environment variable in your .profile ] How do I figure out what the gamma of an image is ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - This is the most tricky bit . As a general rule it seems that a lot of true color ( ie . 24 bit , .ppm .jpg ) images have a gamma of 1.0 ( linear ) , although there are many about that have some gamma correction . It seems that the majority of pseudo color images ( ie . 8 bit images with color maps - .gif etc . ) are gamma corrected to some degree or other . If your viewer does gamma correction then linear images will look good , and gamma corrected images will look too light . If your viewer does n't do gamma correction , then linear images will look too dark , and gamma corrected images will ok. Why Linear images are sometimes not such a good thing -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - One of the reason that many high quality formats ( such as Video ) use gamma correction is that it actually makes better use of the storage medium . This is because the human eye has a logarithmic response to light , and gamma correction has a similar compression characteristic . This means images could make better use of 8 bits per color ( for instance ) , if they used gamma correction . The implication though , is that every time you want to do any image processing you should convert the 8 bit image to 12 or so linear bits to retain the same accuracy . Since little popular software does this , and none of the popular image formats can agree on a standard gamma correction factor , it is difficult to justify gamma corrected images at the popular level . If some image formats can standardize on a particular gamma , and if image manipulation software takes care to use extra precision when dealing with linearized internal data , then gamma corrected distribution of images would be a good thing . ( I am told that the Kodak PhotoCD format for instance , has a standard gamma correction factor that enables it to get the highest quality out of the bits used to hold the image ) . # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #

The railways to the camps were not bombed , despite the ease of doing so . The US , the `` place of refuge '' allowed in a bare pittance of Jews from Europe , primarily for public relations , so that the government could say it was `` doing something '' . Many ships with refugees were turned away from US shores ; some found refuge in Cuba or South America , many others sunk or had to return to Europe ( with predictable consequences ) .

You 're certainly right that the runner is not out merely for running out of the baseline : he must interfere with the play . But the argument here is over what constitutes interference . You certainly can not infer from what you 've quoted that the batter-runner must be hit by the ball to be guilty of interference : you have n't posted a definition of interference at all . IMO this calls for one of the `` approved ruling [ s ] '' that go in small print in the rulebook . Something like : APPROVED RULING : If in the judgement of the umpire the runner , by running to the left of the allowed path , caused the fielder to make a bad throw , blocks the vision of the fielder receiving the throw , or otherwise impedes the defensive team 's making a play on him , the batter-runner shall be judeged guilty of interference . or APPROVED RULING : The runner can not be judged guilty of interference in the unless he makes contact with a fielder or is hit by the thrown ball . -- In the absence of such an approved ruling I claim that this is a poor rules trivia question -- since it can not be authoritatively answered . -- Len Reed Holos Software , Inc.

My Quadra now works at 33 MHz stable for more than 14 hours . I have also tried a 70 MHz osz , but after 1/2 hour my Quadra 700 died . I am not sure what was the reason for that , but it is to risky to run it to fast . Most of your Quadras 700 should work at 33 MHz without any problems . But a safety tip do a backup from your harddisk befor you start to upgrade . During my 35 MHz test I damaged my harddisk and had a hardtime to get it working again .

Most of the other parts on the Quadra board running on there o wn clockspeed so they wont make truble . The most importaned question is do I neat a new heat sink . I would say NO . After running my Quadra for more than 14 hours the heat sink is really cool . A 33 MHz 486 with heat sink is mutch warmer than the 68040 in the Quadra , so I did n't see any problems . The room temperatur was 22 Celsius ( 72 F ) .

As I read the current wiretap law , it would not be legal now . On the other hand , assuming a legislative change , recording but not decrypting Clipper conversations would probably be found constitutional by the Supreme Court , using the same reasoning ( or the lack thereof ... ) by which they permit random roadblocks to check for drunk drivers . Incidentally , if we use that as our model , the Court will likely not uphold selective recording . ( On the other hand , I do n't think they've thrown out `` drug courier profiles '' yet . Must be that exception to the Fourth Amendment that I can never find in my copy of the Bill of Rights . ) A lot -- and I mean a *lot* -- will depend on exactly how Clippertaps ( or Tipperclaps , for encrypted music ? ) are used . Don Alvarez showed in the latest RISKS digest that it 's possible to prevent the cops from reading traffic after their warrant expires . That is -- the cops send the LEF to the F-holder . The F-holder strips off F , and sends U [ K ] , N to the escrow agents . They send either U or K to the cops . ( Don says U , I say K. ) The cops ca n't use U in the future , because they ca n't strip off F. The F-holder never sees U . In Don 's model , the escrow agents ca n't read the traffic , because they do n't have K ; in my model , they have K , but not the message itself . And I trust that more because I think the cops and the FBI ( the F-holder ) are more likely to collaborate on breaking the rules . The net result is that by involving the F-holder and the escrow agents on every tap , we can avoid extending permission to tap .
From : steve-b @ access.digex.com ( Steve Brinich ) Subject : Basic Crypto Requirements Organization : Express Access Online Communications , Greenbelt , MD USA Lines : 20 NNTP-Posting-Host : access.digex.net In order to have formulate a rational position on what cryptography policies are acceptable , we must set forth a list of basic requirements . I would propose the following as a starting point : 1 . The algorithm must be publicly known , and must have a record of surviving attempts by outside experts to find weaknesses . 2 . The system implementation must make it possible to verify that the advertised algorithm is , in fact , the one that is being used . 3 . The key must be quickly changeable by the user , and must be of a sufficient length and complexity to defeat any brute-force search possible now or in the reasonably near future . Note that these requirements are not incompatible with some form of key escrow system ; the May 1993 issue of `` Byte '' describes an example of an encryption system which can clearly be implemented in a manner consistent with the above requirements while requiring that parts of the key be escrowed in order to have one 's public key listed by a central distributor .

How about an average ML pitcher ? I ca n't believe > that Morris ' performance in the playoffs and series had a large positive > impact on the Jays performance ... I know it 's very trendy nowadays to dump on Morris , but let 's give credit where credit is due . It is doubtful that the blue jays would have won the AL east without Morris . Last year , when the team went 13-15 for the month of August , and all the other starters were being shelled , and Milwaukee was making a charge , Morris went 5-1 with a pretty good era ( I ca n't remember exactly ) . Also , let 's not underestimate the importance his 240+ innings to save the bullpen every fifth day . If he did n't help us win the AL east , forget about the pennent and the world series . His run support was high ( 5.98 runs ) but so was Stottlemyer 's ( 5.90 runs ) and he won only 12 games . I do remember Morris winning an inordinate number of 6-5 and 8-6 ballgames , but this is to his credit . He pitched only as good as he needed to be . When he was up 6-1 in a ballgame , he just put it in cruise control and threw the ball up there and let the batters `` get themseleves out '' ( I hate this expression ! ) . An inexperienced pitcher would wear himself out trying to make perfect pitches to keep his era down . But Morris , being a veteran pitcher , knows that winning is the only thing that really matters in baseball . By saving himself , he was able to reach back for that little extra ( I hate this too ! ) when the game was on the line . Yes Morris is crapping out big time this year , but let 's not change history to suit the present . BTW , I think he should be put in the bullpen ; it would be embarrassing a veteran pitcher which Cito would never do , but his era is 17+ , how much more can he be embarrassed ? > > From where I sit , I 'll let others have the excellent players - I'll > settle for good enough and the ring : - ) ditto ! > > Joe Leonard > jle @ world.std.com > eddie

X ] X.SH DESCRIPTION XThe X.B rx Xprogram connect to the specified X.I host Xand executes the specified X.I command Xin the background , returning immediately . To allow the execution Xof X programs , it copies a number of environmental variables to Xthe remote session . If you omit X.IR command , Xthen rx will start an xterm on the remote host . The X.B rxterm Xvarient starts a remote xterm on a host , and also passes X.I args Xto the remote xterm as arguments . X.PP XShell metacharacters which are not quoted are interpreted on the local Xmachine , while quoted metacharacters are interpreted on the remote Xmachine . X.PP XIf the name of the file from which X.B rx Xis executed is anything other than `` rx , '' X.B rx Xtakes this name , stripped on a leading `` r '' as the command Xto run on the remote host , using any X.I command Xparameters as arguments for the remote command . X.PP XIf X.B rx Xthinks you are using X.B xauth Xbased X authorisation , and you are calling to a off-site host , or Xto a different username , it will attempt to copy an authorization Xkey to the remote account . Otherwise it will try to use X.B xhost ( 1 ) Xto grant access to the remote host . X.SH OPTIONS X.TP X.BI \-l `` username '' XUse X.I username Xas the remote username instead of your local username . In the absence Xof this option , the remote username is the same as your local username . X X.SH ENVIRONMENT XIf set , the values of PATH , DISPLAY , XENVIRONMENT , XAPPLRESDIR , XXFILESEARCHPATH , XUSERFILESEARCHPATH , OPENWINHOME , LD_LIBRARY_PATH , Xand XAUTHORITY are exported to the remote program , unless the Xremote username is different , or the remote host is off-site , in which Xcase only DISPLAY is exported , with in all cases any variables named in the Xvariable RXENV . X.PP XThe DISPLAY variable is tweaked as appropriate , to contain as qualified Xa hostname as is needed . X.SH DIAGNOSTICS X.TP X.IB command `` : do n't recognise my name . '' X.B rx Xcannot decode the name it has been called under . In this case Xit prints a warning message , and continues , as normal . X.TP X.B `` rx : usage : rx [ -l username ] hostname [ args ... ] '' XThis means it could not decode the arguments given to it . X.SH AUTHOR XDuncan Sinclair < sinclair @ dcs.glasgow.ac.uk > , July 1992 X.br XOriginally based on a program with the same name from the X.B gwm Xdistribution . To distinguish this `` rx '' from other programs Xwith similar names , you should refer to this program as the X.B Glasgow X.BR rx . X.SH `` SEE ALSO '' XX ( 1 ) , rsh ( 1 ) , xterm ( 1 ) , xauth ( 1 ) , xhost ( 1 ) , gwm ( 1 ) X.SH BUGS X.B Rx Xmakes a number of assumptions about the relationship between the Xlocal user , and the remote one , depending on whether the remote Xhost is onsite or not , and whether an alternative username was used Xor not . X.PP XIn particular , if either the locally used shell , or the remotely Xused shell is the standard Bourne Shell , X.B sh ( 1 ) Xthen strange things are more likely to happen . Especially when Xit 's only one of them . X.PP XSometimes quoting can get messed up . X.PP XIt 's too easy to fool the smarts in X.B rx Xto make it believe something that is not true , and fail because of it . X.PP XWhen X.B rx Xuses X.B xhost Xto grant access , the X.B xhost Xcommand may fail silently . X.PP XIf X.B rx Xtries to send to large a command to the remote machine , it will Xlikely fail with a parse error from csh . If this happens , you Xwill probably have to reduce the size of the exported environment .

Plus it offers a full range of resolutions , high refresh rates as well as unique proprietary performance features . The card is available in both 16-bit ISA bus and 32-bit VESA Local bus versions ( models 8500 AND 8500VL ) . With 1MB DRAM on board , the WINDOWSVGA 24 card offers maximum resolution up to 1,280 x 1,024 and supports a refresh rate of 72Hz at 800 x 600 and resolution up to 1,024 x 768 non-interlaced . Both models provide performance many times greater than standard SVGA boards , yet conform to all current video standards . WINDOWSVGA 24 features Genoa 's FlickerFree ( tm ) technology , which eliminates screen flash and flicker to make viewing much more comfortable . the cards also come with Safescan ( tm ) , a utility developed by Genoa to eliminate the black border around the screen and thereby provide 100-percent screen use for overscanning monitors . WINDOWSVGA model 8500VL takes full advantage of the speed offered by the new VESA Local bus technology . Most VL bus cards will only handle data transfers up to 33MHz , but the 8500VL will transfer data at the full speed of the CPU , up to 50MHz . Genoa is also offering this card in the `` TurboBahn '' combination packaged with their TURBOEXPRESS 486VL motherboard . Built around the Cirrus Logic GD-5426 GUI accelerator , WINDOWSVGA 24 offers the user an exceptional price/performance value . Genoa 's advanced proprietary drivers act to `` turbocharge '' the chip , thereby providing an affordable accelerator card with power and performance that surpass many of the more highly priced chip cards . The Genoa user will enjoy optimal speed and reliability for such programs as Windows , AutoCAD , AutoShade , 3D Studio , OS/2 , OrCAD and more . Driver updates and product bulletins are available on Genoa 's BBS at ( 408 ) 943-1231 . Genoa Systems manufactures and markets an extensive line of graphics adapters , motherboards , audio and multimedia cards for IBM-compatible personal computers .

Now IF you would like to reduce the number , how would you do it without affecting good/responcible gun owners ? ? I DO believe in a persons freedom .

Cars and guns should really not be mixed , I just tried to make a point . Like America , Norway has some spaces you have to cross to get from a to b , so a car is essential in most parts ... . Guns on the other hand are not essential in Norway , so we do n't argue that IF we 'banned ' guns we HAVE to ban cars ... .. EVERYONE who believe that Hitler and WW2 could be avoided if there were more guns in Germany in the 30 's : PLEASE read some HISTORY ! Is this discussion about 1 . Banning weapons for ALL Americans or 2 . Making it harder for criminals to get one ? ? Change of name ... ... . Wrote that one after reading the first postings about the Waco 'incident ' . I still think there are 'some ' posters should move their post to alt.conspiracy or make a new newsgroup .

I bought a brand new 1992 Chevrolet K2500 HD 4x4 extended cab last May . It has had many , many problems . See my earler post that describes the situation . I went to BBB arbitration , and they ruled that Chevrolet must buy it back from me . If you do get one , stay away from the 5 speed manual with the deep low first gear . They have put three of them in my truck so far . After about 1,500 miles , overdrive either starts rattling or hissing loudly . There is no way to fix them . Chevrolet says that the noise is `` a characteristic of the transmission . '' Also , if you are planning to use your truck to tow , the gear ratios in that tranny suck . On a steep hill , you get up to about 55 MPH in second gear at 4,000 RPM ( yellow line ) . If you shift to third , the RPM drop to only 2,500 , and you begin to loose speed . I should point out that the 350 V8 they put in the HD ( 8600 GVW ) trucks is a detuned motor compared to the one they put in the light duty ones . They dropped the compression ratio , supposedly for `` engine longevity '' reasons . So the light duty 350 may pull better than my truck does . Other things that have gone wrong include the ventilation fan ( 3 times so far ) , paint ( had specs of rust embedded in the paint from being shipped by rail with no covering ) , and suspension parts ( link between stabilizer and control arm fell off ) . Any company can make a bad individual car , Chevrolet included . What really bothered me was the way they reacted . They made no attempt to deal with me except to tell me to take it back to the dealer for them to attempt to fix it one more time . So I bought a brand new Ford F250 HD Super Cab with a 460 and an automatic . I will never buy another Chevrolet . jackw @ hpdmd48.boi.hp.com

You 'll probably find that it already has horizontal and vertical drive outputs that just aren't being used . A couple of cables and you 're in business . Another possibility is to find a genlockable sync generator with HD and VD outputs - genlock it to station sync , and then feed HD and VD to the cameras .

Is it always this way ? ) then we are going to have trouble finding the > true value of DHs using the same models as that for position players . There are several reasons for this difference . The main reason is that good hitters in their prime ( such as Frank Thomas and Danny Tartabull ) are rarely regular DH 's , even if they ca n't field ; it 's more commonly a place to put aging veterans . Another use of the DH slot is to help a player come back from injury slowly , getting his bat in the lineup without forcing him to play in the field . I would expect such players to hit worse as DH 's than they did during the rest of the season . A third factor is that most player who split time between DH and first or the outfield do n't hit as well as DH 's for some reason . Reggie Jackson was a good example ; in five years as a RF/DH for the Angels , he hit like the old Reggie when he was in right . The second and third factors will be lost if players are considered by their primary position only ; a player who plays 90 games in right and 60 at DH will count only in the right fielders ' averages . > A logical starting place would be to look at defensive replacement > value ( if you can find it ) for 1B or LF or something .

This > would let us `` discount '' the time they spend playing DH , because that > forces the team to find another real fielder to play . This makes sense ; you might also look at it another way . Although the *average* offensive performance of a DH may be lower than for a left fielder , the *replacement-level* offensive performance is certainly lower ; if you are a left fielder but ca n't hit well enough to keep a job anywhere , then you certainly ca n't hit well enough to keep a job at DH . -- David Grabiner , grabiner @ zariski.harvard.edu '' We are sorry , but the number you have dialed is imaginary .

So are drives based on the slightly-faster Toshiba XM3401 . Some companies selling such drives are : Spin Peripherals ( a bargain at $ 499 ) and PLI ( a company I hate ) and Relax Technologies ( a company I know little about other than that they are a longtime player in Mac mailorder , which is usually a good sign ) . The NEC CDR74 is also a good choice ( NEC 's own mechanism , I think ) . ClubMac sells it for around $ 619 . > Thanx . Your welcome , ooh but now I see your from Germany . Most of the mailorder info does you little good , I guess .

The Toshiba 's speed advantage is very slight : 20 % in average access time ( a minor plus ) and 10 % in data transfer rate ( a slightly more important plus ) . Good luck , Mark

The way I understand what happened is that she discussed with Clinton what was being planned for Waco . Clinton did n't say no , so gave de facto approval for the operation . Things got messed up , and a lot of people died horrible deaths . ( if I am incorrect about this , please feel free to correct it . This is just what I 've been able to pick up . ) I 've just got a couple of questions about this whole thing . ( 1 ) Why did the government feel they needed to assault that compound ?

From : pjc @ jet.uk ( Peter J Card ) Subject : Re : Over zealous shuttle critics Organization : Joint European Torus Lines : 40 We ` ve had the the Great Western , the [ dunno ] and the Great Northern postulated as Brunel ` s masterpiece . Keep boxing the compass chaps , you ` ll get round to it eventually . The Great Western was a highly successful transatlantic mail ship , with hybrid sail and steam propulsion . The Great Eastern , which broke the 'Little Giant ' financially and otherwise , was a revolutionary leap forward in ship design . A thirty thousand ton all steel vessel , with primary steam propulsion , it was at the time easily the biggest ocean going vessel ever built . Brunel took advantage of the fact that cargo and / or fuel capacity rose with the cube of scale , while drag rose with the square , so a really big ship could steam thousands of miles without coaling . Unfortunately , there was no real market for such a beast at the time , and it was eventually sold off at scrap values . As another poster said , it then went on to a successful career as a telegraph cable laying ship . It was in fact the only ship of its day capable of laying a transatlantic cable in one go , with the endurance and capacity to carry the huge reel all the way , and the manoeuverabilty to dredge for defective sections . See Arthur C Clarke ` s book `` How the World was One '' [ I think that ` s right ] If that ` s how the Shuttle goes down in history , as a technical triumph and a financial disaster for the builder , it would not be entirely ignoble , but I doubt if history will be so charitable . Its true the Shuttle can do things no other launch system can do , but are they worth doing ? With low cost access to space , you could have an affordable space station for doing shuttle-like extended manned missions .

It 's pretty simple : Say E is encryption ( and D decryption ) with key K on 64-bit blocks . Let c [ 0 ] be the initialisation vector , m [ 1 ] , m [ 2 ] , ... the message blocks , c [ 1 ] , c [ 2 ] , ... the cipher text blocks . Then encryption in cipher block chaining ( CBC ) mode works by the formula c [ i ] = E ( m [ i ] XOR c [ i-1 ] ) , and decryption by m [ i ] = c [ i-1 ] XOR D ( c [ i ] ) . So if the attacker does n't have c [ 0 ] this only affects the first message block m [ 1 ] . But she can do her key search attack on m [ 2 ] , m [ 3 ] , ... The situation in cipher feedback ( CFB ) mode is a bit more complicated but similar and left as an exercise for the reader : - ) Finally there is the modified output feedback mode ( OFB ) where DES ( or whatever block cipher you use ) simply acts as random generator by s [ i ] = E ( s [ i-1 ] ) with initialisation vector ( = seed ) s [ 0 ] , and encryption is given by c [ i ] = m [ i ] XOR s [ i ] . Here the usual ` known plaintext ' attack against XOR-bitstream ciphers reduces the cracking to key search for K. -- Klaus Pommerening Institut fuer Medizinische Statistik und Dokumentation der Johannes-Gutenberg-Universitaet Obere Zahlbacher Strasse 69 , W-6500 Mainz , Germany

From : jamesc @ netcom.com ( James Chuang ) Subject : Re : Any info on Cyrix 486DRu2 chip ? Organization : Netcom - Online Communication Services ( 408 241-9760 guest ) Lines : 64 It seems that there are a lot of questions regarding the Cyrix 386 compatible 486DLC and 486DRU2 . My info comes directly from Cyrix 's Fast Fax service : And also from installing one of these chips in an IBM Model 80 . The 486DLC is a 486 instruction set compatible CPU which fits into a 386DX socket ( Pin Grid Array , or PGA ) . The DLC currently is available in 3 speeds . the 25 , the 33 , and the 40 . They do not have a coprocessor on board , but any software query will return coproc as present . I guess they emulate the coproc instructions . Math functions are on the 386DX level without the actual coprocessor . The internal cache on the 486DLC is 1K . Cyrix literature claims a 85 % hit rate . My informal tests show that the cache accounts for a 10 % performance boost when it is enabled by software . Overall performance boost from a 386DX-25 to a 486DLC-25 is about 60 % . The benchmarks I used were NU SI and QAPlus Dhrystones and Whetstones . The performance , with the cache enabled , is about on a par with my 386DX-40 with 256K external CPU cache , which is around the performance for a 486SX-25 . The computer runs noticebly faster , and DOS 6 with Dblspace is not complaining . The company claims OS/2 compatibility , but I did n't test it . The 486DRU2 is not a chip , as commonly thought . The 486DRU2 is actually a small daughterboard slightly larger than the 386DX , which contains the logic to manage the clock doubler . This board plugs into the 386DX PGA , and the 486DLC-33 or 40 plugs into this board . I guess the board doubles the frequency apparent to the CPU , and insert wait states when access to the rest of the system is required . There are no info available from Cyrix there . Anyway , the DRU2 is available for 386DX-16 , and 386DX-20 only . Double these clock rates , and you get the 32MHZ and the 40MHZ DLCs . If Cyrix is planning to do the same thing for the DRU2-50 , then they need to put out the 50MHz DLC2 first ... I also tested a DLC33 motherboard , along with a Cyrix Coprocessor . With 64K external cache , performance were about 30 % faster than the 25 , but still significantly ( 25 % ? ) slower than an actual Intel 486DX . IMHO , the DLC is a great , low price upgrade for people who ca n't afford , or ca n't install , a new motherboard . It is definitely worth what I paid for it , but if you need 486DX-33 performance , the DLC33 wo n't cut it . I 'm not sure about the DLC-40 , but I think even if it matches the performance , it won't beat it in any significant way . The last time I posted info about the DLC , people sent quite a bit of mail , asking where I got it . So here is where I got mine : Treasure Chest peripherals , they advertise in the Computer Shopper . 1-800-677-9781 The 486DLC-25 kit was $ 179.00 But ... . I liked the chip so much that I found the supplier , and became a dealer . If you are interested in the chip , e-mail me , and I can fax or mail you more info . I 'm well aware of the net 's policy against commercial use , So I can ; t post anymore info here . However , if there are more questions regarding the 486DLC itself , I 'll post what I can . jamesc 909-396-0408 -- ========================================= If someone asks if you are a God , you say ...

From : hedrick @ geneva.rutgers.edu Subject : FAQ essay on homosexuality Lines : 452 Someone referred to my FAQ essay on homosexuality . Since it hasn't been posted for some time ( and I 've modified it somewhat since the last time ) , I 'm taking this opportunity to post it . There is another entry in the FAQ containing comments by some other contributors . They can be retrieved from ftp.rutgers.edu as pub/soc.religion.christian/others/homosexuality . It contains far more detail on the exegetical issues than I give here , though primarily from a conservative point of view . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- This posting summarizes several issues involving homosexuality and Christians . This is a frequently asked question , so I do not post the question each time it occurs . Rather this is an attempt to summarize the postings we get when we have a discussion . It summarizes arguments for allowing Christian homosexuality , since most people asking the question already know the arguments against it . The most common -- but not the only -- question dealt with herein is `` how can a Christian justify being a homosexual , given what the Bible says about it ? '' First , on the definition of 'homosexual ' . Many groups believe that there is a homosexual `` orientation '' , i.e . a sexual attraction to members of the same sex . This is distinguished from actual homosexual sexual activity . Homosexuals who abstain from sex are considered by most groups to be acceptable . However in a lot of discussion , the term 'homosexual ' means someone actually engaging in homosexual sex . This is generally not accepted outside the most 'liberal ' groups . In this paper I 'm going to use 'homosexual ' as meaning a person engaging in sexual acts with another of the same sex . I have n't heard of any Biblical argument against a person with homosexual orientation who remains celebate . I think most people now admit that there is a predisposition to be homosexual . This is often called a 'homosexual orientation ' . It is not known whether it is genetic or environmental . There is evidence suggesting each . The best evidence I 've seen is that homosexuality is not a single phenomenon , but has a number of different causes . One of them is probably genetic . There are several groups that try to help people move from being homosexual to heterosexual . The best-known is Exodus International '' . The reports I 've seen ( and I have n't read the detailed literature , just the summary in the minority opinion to the Presbyterian Church 's infamous report on human sexuality ) suggest that these programs have very low success rates , and that there are questions about how real even the successes are . But there certainly are people who say they have converted . However this issue is not as important as it sounds . Those who believe homosexuality is wrong believe it is intrinsically wrong , defined as such by God . The fact that it 's hard to get out of being a homosexual is no more relevant than the fact that it 's hard to escape from being a drug addict . If it 's wrong , it 's wrong . It may affect how we deal with people though . If it 's very difficult to change , this may tend to make us more willing to forgive it . One more general background issue : It 's common to quote a figure that 10 % of the population is homosexual . I asked one of our experts where this came from . Here 's his response : Kinsey ( see below ) is the source of the figure 10 percent . He defines sexuality by behavior , not by orientation , and ranked all persons on a scale from Zero ( completely heterosexual ) to 6 ( completely heterosexual ) . According to Kinsey , one-third of all male adults have had at least one experience of orgasm homosexually post puberty . Ten percent of all adult males have most of their experiences of homosexually . That was in 1948 . The percentages held true in a followup study done by the Kinsey Institute , based on data in the early seventies but not published until the early 80s or so , by Bell and Weinberg , I believe . I can't put my hand on this latter reference , but here is the online information for Kinsey 's own study as it appears in IRIS , the catalog at Rutgers : AUTHOR Kinsey , Alfred Charles , 1894-1956 .

LC CARD 48005195 This figure is widely used in all scholarly discussions and has even been found to hold true in several other cultures , as noted in the recent NEWSWEEK coverstory `` Is this child gay ? '' ( Feb. 24 , 1992 ) . A journalist is running the rounds of talk shows this season promoting her book that allegedly refutes Kinsey 's study , but the scholarly world seems to take her for a kook ... ... I 've seen some objections to the Kinsey 's study , but not in enough detail to include here . ( If someone would like to contribute another view , I 'd be willing to include it . ) Most Christians believe homosexuality ( at least genital sex ) is wrong . Not all , however . A few denominations accept it . The Metropolitan Community Churches is the best-known -- it was formed specifically to accept homosexuals . However the United Church of Christ also allows it , and I think a couple of other groups may as well . The Episcopal Church seems to accept it some areas but not others . In churches that have congregational government , you 'll find a few congregations that accept it ( even among Southern Baptists , though the number is probably only one or two congregations ) . But these are unusual -- few churches permit homosexual church leaders . How carefully they enforce this is another issue . I do n't have any doubt that there are homosexual pastors of just about every denomination , some more open than others . As to the arguments over the Biblical and other issues , here 's an attempt to summarize the issues : The most commonly cited reference by those favoring acceptance of homosexuality in previous discussions has been John Boswell : '' Christianity , Social Tolerance , and Homosexuality '' , U Chicago Press , 1980 . The argument against is pretty clear . There are several explicit laws in the OT , e.g . Leviticus 20:13 , and in Rom 1 Paul seems pretty negative on homosexuality . Beyond these references , there are some debates . Some passages often cited on the subject probably are not relevant . E.g . the sin which the inhabitants of Sodom proposed to carry out was homosexual *rape* , not homosexual activity between consenting adults . ( There 's even some question whether it was homosexual , since the entities involved were angels . ) It was particularly horrifying because it involved guests , and the responsibility towards guests in that culture was very strong . ( This is probably the reason Lot offered his daughter -- it was better to give up his daughter than to allow his guests to be attacked . ) If you look through a concordance for references to Sodom elsewhere in the Bible , you 'll see that few seem to imply that homosexuality was their sin . There 's a Jewish interpretive tradition that the major sin was abuse of guests . At any rate , there 's no debate that homosexual *rape* is wrong . I do not discuss Leviticus because the law there is part of a set of laws that most Christians do not consider binding . So unless NT justification can be found , Lev . alone would not settle the issue . The NT references are all in Paul 's letters . A number of the references from Paul are lists of sins in which the words are fairly vague . Boswell argues that the words occuring in these lists do not mean homosexual . Here 's what he says : The two Greek words that appear in the lists ( i.e . I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10 ) are /malakos/ and /arsenokoitai/ . Unfortunately it is not entirely clear what the words actually mean . /malakos/ , with a basic meaning of soft , has a variety of metaphorical meanings in ethical writing . Boswell suggests '' wanton '' as a likely equivalent . He also reports that the unanimous interpretation of the Church , including Greek-speaking Christians , was that in this passage it referred to masturbation , a meaning that has vanished only in the 20th Cent. , as that practice has come to be less frowned-upon . ( He cites references as late as the 1967 edition of the Catholic Encyclopedia that identify it as masturbation . ) He translates /arsenokotai/ as male prostitute , giving evidence that none of the church fathers understood the term as referring to homosexuality in general . A more technical meaning , suggested by the early Latin translations , would be `` active mode homosexual male prostitute '' , but in his view Paul did not intend it so technically . For a more conservative view , I consulted Gordon Fee 's commentary on I Cor . He cites evidence that /malakos/ often meant effeminate . However Boswell warns us that in Greek culture effeminate is not necessarily synonymous with homosexual , though it may be associated with some kinds of homosexual behavior . Given what Boswell and Fee say taken together , I suspect that the term is simply not very definite , and that while it applies to homosexuals in some cases , it is n't a general term for homosexuality . While Fee argues against Boswell with /arsenokotai/ as well , he ends up suggesting a translation that seems essentially the same . The big problem with it is that the word is almost never used . Paul 's writing is the first occurence . The fact that the word is clearly composed of `` male '' and '' f**k '' unfortunately does n't quite tell us the meaning , since it does n't tell us whether the male is the subject or object of the action . Examples of compound words formed either way can be given . In theory it could refer to rapists , etc . It 's dangerous to base meaning purely on etymology , or you 'll conclude that `` goodbye '' is a religious expression because it 's based on `` God by with ye '' . However since Boswell , Fee , and NIV seem to agree on `` homosexual male prostitute '' , that seems as good a guess as any . Note that this translation misses the strong vulgarity of the term however ( something which Fee and Boswell agree on , but do not attempt to reproduce in their translation ) . In my opinion , the strongest NT reference to homosexuality is Romans 1 . Boswell points out that Rom 1 speaks of homosexuality as something that happened to people who were naturally heterosexual , as a result of their corruption due to worshipping false gods . One could argue that this is simply an example : that if a homosexual worshipped false gods , he would also fall into degradation and perhaps become heterosexual . However I find this argument somewhat forced , and in fact our homosexual readers have not seriously proposed that this is what Paul meant . However I am not convinced that Rom 1 is sufficient to create a law against homosexuality for Christians . What Paul is describing in Rom 1 is not homosexuality among Christians -- it 's homosexuality that appeared among idolaters as one part of a whole package of wickedness . Despite the impression left by his impassioned rhetoric , I 'm sure Paul does not believe that pagans completely abandoned heterosexual sex . Given his description of their situation , I rather assume that their heterosexual sex would also be debased and shameless . So yes , I do believe that this passage indicates a negative view of homosexuality . But in all fairness , the `` shameless '' nature of their acts is a reflection of the general spiritual state of the people , and not a specific feature of homosexuality . My overall view of the situation is the following : I think we have enough evidence to be confident that Paul disapproved of homosexuality . Rom 1 seems clear . While I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10 are not unambiguous and general condemnations of homosexuality , they do not seem like wording that would come from someone who approved of homosexuality or even considered it acceptable in some cases . On the other hand , none of these passages contains explicit teachings on the subject . Rom 1 is really about idolatry . It refers to homosexuality in passing . The result of this situation is that people interpret these passages in light of their general approach to Scripture . For those who look to Scripture for laws about issues such as this , it not surprising that they would consider these passages to be NT endorsement of the OT prohibition . For those whose approach to the Bible is more liberal , it is not surprising that they regard Paul 's negative view of homosexuality as something that he took from his Jewish upbringing without any serious reexamination in the light of the Gospel . As readers of this group know by now , the assumptions behind these approaches are so radically different that people tend to foam at the mouth when they see the opposing view described . There 's not a lot I can do as moderator about such a situation . A number of discussions in the past centered around the sort of detailed exegesis of texts that is described above . However in fact I 'm not convinced that defenders of homosexuality actually base their own beliefs on such analyses . The real issue seems to rest on the question of whether Paul 's judgement should apply to modern homosexuality . One commonly made claim is that Paul had simply never faced the kinds of questions we are trying to deal with . He encountered homosexuality only in contexts where most people would probably agree that it was wrong . He had never faced the experience of Christians who try to act '' straight '' and fail , and he had never faced Christians who are trying to define a Christian homosexuality , which fits with general Christian ideals of fidelity and of seeing sexuality as a mirror of the relationship between God and man . It is unfair to take Paul's judgement on homosexuality among idolaters and use it to make judgements on these questions . Another is the following : In Paul 's time homosexuality was associated with a number of things that Christians would not find acceptable . It was part of temple prostitution . Among private citizens , it often occured between adults and children or free people and slaves . I'm not in a position to say that it always did , but there are some reasons to think so . The ancients distinguished between the active and passive partner . It was considered disgraceful for a free adult to act as the passive partner . ( This is the reason that an active mode homosexual prostitute would be considered disgraceful . His customers would all be people who enjoyed the passive role . ) This supports the idea that it would tend not to be engaged in between two free adult males , at least not without some degree of scandal . Clearly Christian homosexuals would not condone sex with children , slaves , or others who are not in a position to be fully responsible partners . ( However Fee 's commentary on I Cor cites some examples from ancient literature of homosexual relationships that do seem to involve free adults in a reasonably symmetrical way . Thus the considerations in this paragraph should n't be pushed too far . Homosexuality may have been discredited for Jews by some of these associations , but there surely must be been cases that were not prostitutes and did not involve slaves or children . ) Some people have argued that AIDS is a judgement against homosexuality . I 'd like to point out that AIDS is transmitted by promiscuous sex , both homosexual and heterosexual . Someone who has a homosexual relationship that meets Christian criteria for marriage is not at risk for AIDS . Note that there is good reason from Paul 's general approach to doubt that he would concede homosexuality as a fully equal alternative , apart from any specific statements on homosexuality . I believe his use of the Genesis story would lead him to regard heterosexual marriage as what God ordained . However the way Paul deals with pastoral questions provides a warning against being too quick to deal with this issue legally . I claim that the question of how to counsel homosexual Christians is not entirely a theological issue , but also a pastoral one . Paul's tendency , as we can see in issues such as eating meat and celebrating holidays , is to be uncompromising on principle but in pastoral issues to look very carefully at the good of the people involved , and to avoid insisting on perfection when it would be personally damaging . For example , while Paul clearly believed that it was acceptable to eat meat , he wanted us to avoid pushing people into doing an action about which they had personal qualms . For another example , Paul obviously would have preferred to see people ( at least in some circumstances ) remain unmarried . Yet if they were unable to do so , he certainly would rather see them married than in a state where they might be tempted to fornication . I believe one could take a view like this even while accepting the views Paul expressed in Rom 1 . One may believe that homosexuality is not what God intended , that it occured as a result of sin , but still conclude that at times we have to live with it . Note that in the creation story work enters human life as a result of sin . This does n't mean that Christians can stop working when we are saved . The question is whether you believe that homosexuality is in itself sinful or whether you believe that it 's a misfortune that is in a broad sense due to human sinfulness . If you 're willing to consider the latter approach , then it becomes a pastoral judgement whether there is more damage caused by finding a way to live with it or trying to cure it . The dangers of trying to cure it are that the attempt most often fails , and when it does , you end up with damage ranging from psychological damage to suicide , as well as broken marriages when attempts at living as a heterosexual fail . This is going to depend upon one 's assessment of the inherent nature of homosexuality . If you believe it is a very serious wrong , then you may be willing to run high risks of serious damage to get rid of it . Clearly we do not generally suggest that people live with a tendency to steal or with drug addiction , even though attempts to cure these conditions are also very difficult . However these conditions are intrinsically damaging in a way that is not so obvious for homosexuality . ( Many problems associated with homosexuality are actually problems of promiscuity , not homosexuality . This includes AIDS . I take for granted that the only sort of homosexual relationships a Christian would consider allowing would be equivalent to Christian heterosexual relationships . ) In the course of discussing this over the last decade or so , we've heard a lot of personal testimony from fellow Christians who are in this situation . I 've also seen summaries of various research and the results of various efforts for `` conversion '' . ( Aside from the Presbyterian report mentioned above , there 's an FAQ that summarizes our readers ' reports on this question . ) The evidence is that long-term success in changing orientation is rare enough to be on a par with healing miracles . The danger in advising Christians to depend upon such a change is clear : When `` conversion '' does n't happen , which is almost always , the people are often left in despair , feeling excluded from a Church that has nothing more to say but a requirement of life-long celibacy . Paul recognized ( though in a different context ) that such a demand is not practical for most people , and I think the history of clerical celibacy has strongly reinforced that judgement . The practical result is that homosexuals end up in the gay sex clubs and the rest of the sordid side of homosexuality . Maybe homosexuality is n't God 's original ideal , but I can well imagine Paul preferring to see people in long-term , committed Christian relationships than promiscuity . As with work -- which Genesis suggests was n't part of God 's original ideal either -- I think such relationships can still be a vehicle for people sharing God 's love with each other . There 's an issue of Biblical interpretation underlying this discussion . The issue is that of `` cultural relativism '' . That is , when Paul says that something is wrong , should this be taken as an eternal statement , or are things wrong because of specific situations in the culture of the time ? Conservative Christians generally insist on taking prohibitions as absolute , since otherwise the Bible becomes subjective -- what is to stop us from considering everything in it as relative ? When looking at this issue , it 's worth noting that no one completely rejects the concept of cultural relativism . There are a number of judgements in the New Testament that even conservative Christians consider to be relative . The following judgements are at least as clear in the Bible as anything said on homosexuality : - prohibition against charging interest ( this occurs 18 times in the OT -- it 's not in the NT , but I mention it here because until relatively recently the Church did consider it binding on Christians ) - prohibition against swearing oaths - endorsement of slavery as an institution - judgement of tax collectors as sinner We do not regard these items as binding . In most cases , I believe the argument is essentially one of cultural relativism . Briefly : - prohibition of interest is appropriate to a specific agrarian society that the Bible was trying to build , but not to our market economy . - few people believe that American judicial oaths have the same characteristics as the kind of oaths Jesus was concerned about - most people believe that Paul was simply telling people how to live within slavery , but not endorsing it as an institution - for people believe that the IRS is morally equivalent to Roman tax farming The point I 'm trying to make is that before applying Biblical prohibitions to the 20th Cent. , we need to look at whether the 20th Cent . actions are the same . When Christian homosexuals say that their relationships are different than the Greek homosexuality that Paul would have been familiar with , this is exactly the same kind of argument that is being made about judicial oaths and tax collectors . Until fairly recently Christians prohibited taking of interest , and many Christians regarded slavery as divinely endorsed . ( Indeed , slavery is one of the more common metaphors for the relationship between God and human beings -- Christians are often called servants or slaves of God . ) I am not trying to say that everything in the Bible is culturally relative . Rather , I 'm trying to say that *some* things are , and therefore it is not enough to say that because something appears in the Bible , that ends the discussion . We need to look at whether the action we 're talking about now has the same moral implications as the one that the Bible was talking about . If Christians want to argue that there are reasons to think that the prohibitions against homosexuality are still binding , I 'm willing to listen . Those who claim that the question does n't need to be looked at are kidding themselves ( unless they are part of the small minority who really obey all the rules listed above ) . One thing that worries me is the great emotions that this issue creates . When you consider the weakness of the Biblical evidence -- some laws in Leviticus , a passage in Rom whose subject matter is really idolatry rather than homosexuality , and a couple of lists whose words are ambiguous -- the amount of concern this is raising among Christians seems rather out of proportion . This should suggest to people that there are reasons other than simply Biblical involved . This is true on both sides -- clearly homosexual Christians are as strongly motivated to find ways of discrediting the Biblical arguments as conservative Christians are to find Biblical arguments . But I ca n't help feeling that the Bible is being used by both sides as a way of justifying attitudes which come from other sources . This is a dangerous situation for Christians . On the other side of the issue , I would like to note some problems I have with the pro-homosexual position as it is commonly presented . One of the most common arguments is that homosexuality is biologically determined . I.e . `` God made me homosexual '' , and I have no choice . I think `` God made me homosexual '' is a fine view for people who already believe on other grounds that homosexuality is acceptable . But I do n't see it as an argument for acceptability . Many people think that alcholism is largely biological , and drug addiction may turn out to be as well . That does n't mean it 's OK . Most of us have particular things we tend to do wrong . Some people get angry easily . Others tend to be arrogant . Others tend to be attraced to women who are married to someone else . Homosexuality ( if we view it as wrong ) would n't be different than any of these other things . If we are going to follow God , we all end up at one time or another having to work to overcome bad habits and particular temptations that cause us problems . None of us can sit back and say that because God made us the way we are we can just relax . As Jesus said , we all have to take up our cross daily . This concept of dying to self ( which also appears throughout Paul 's letters ) seems to suggest that there are going to be things about ourselves that we we are called on not to accept . Paul 's letters and the experience of Christians throughout history show us that sin is ingrained in us , and the battle against it is lifelong and difficult . The fact that homosexuality is difficult to fight does n't necessarily say it 's OK. Maybe this is n't the place where we have to die to self . But I 'd like to make sure that those who think it is n't are fighting the battle somewhere else , and not rejecting the concept that all Christians have to fight against the deeply engrained habits of sin .

How many such chances does he get during a game ? Many fewer than he gets chances to catch throws from 2B , SS,3B and P ( I mean the total of these is much higher than Grounder/Popup totals ) . This implies to me that there is value in catching these throws well , even if they are high , up-the-line or in the dirt . `` Good Hands '' are needed for such plays , and thus have value . I do n't have any numbers for the relative number of occurences of these plays , but I 'd guess that the values of these abilities are similar . It 's just like : you do n't judge catcher 's defense primarily on how they field bunts and popups . ( But not as marked I suppose ) . Michael

In addition , our hatred of the sin often causes us to say and That is an assumption on your part . Where is your proof that one always will degenerate into hating the sinner , because he hates the sin . I am reminded of the Civil Rights movement in America . It is true that many individuals hated the proponents of racism . It is also true that many individuals hated segregation and discrimination with their whole heart and never degenerated into hating the individuals who practiced it . Dr. King's message was this . Love the individual , the loving of the individual would transform him into a friend . However , this did not take away his hatred for segregation . His hatred for injustice . > In the summary of the law , Christ commands us to love God and to love our > neighbors . He does n't say anything about hate .

I would ask , `` Did John the Baptist practice love when he criticized the Jewish Leaders of his day ? '' Did Jesus Practice love when he threw the moneychangers out of the temple ? We must have at least a distase for sin . We must in order to fight it in ourselves . Also we must be ready for the call from God to call sin by its right name . Jesus loved everyone , but he called sin by its right name . It is true that love for others is to guide every step of our walk , but it is also true that sometimes the love for God calls us to stand up for truth . -- '' Competition is the law of the jungle .

It would be nice to know that they are not a front company used by an intelligence or other agency of the U.S. government . While we are at it , the chip design ( s ) should be examined and verified against silicon to insure no trap doors or hidden protocols exist in silicon , regardless of the security level of the encryption algorithm . There is no proof that the chip wo n't squeel and role over for someone with the proper knowledge to interrogate it via the communications link . The design examination should be done to the gate level . Also , how does one verify that what you are looking at is reflected in tapeout , or masks ? The silicon should be examined as well , the design in hand ( a clean room publicly defined clipper chip ) can be merged with another design later , or changed between completion and mask out . There is little proof that what you are told is in the chip is all that is in the chip . Put the ( verified ) masks in escrow , and use them for chip production , use a third escrow party for programming the chips . The government is asking for a lot of blind trust : the encryption algorithm , operating protocols , the agency having physical control of the devices , the silicon implementation . If the government is so trustworthy , why escrow anything ?

What is your proof that they `` did the best they could '' ? Unless they had strong evidence that the children were in IMMEDIATE danger then `` the best they could '' have done was to SHOW RESTRAINT . Some of us DID predict this outcome , or at least suggested a strong possibility of it . I , for one , said that in the event of an assault against the building the CHILDREN were the ones in danger either from the assault itself or from a `` Jonestown '' ( my phrase a week after the seige started ) style suicide . And as I pointed out then , and repeatedly over the objections of people on the net who disagreed with me , an adult may freely choose suicide but they have no right to impose this choice on their children . Now , while I do n't expect the FBI to pay any attention to what I have to say on this , I *DO* expect them to figure it out on their own or to take the advice of experts . The cult specialist inter- viewed in yesterday 's Boston Globe said he was repeatedly `` stonewalled '' by the FBI when he pointed out to them that their confrontational tactics played perfectly into Koresh 's mad view of the world and so increased the chance of a tragic outcome . > Some responses have gone so far to suggest that the actions were > done without regard for the lives of the people in the compound - give > me a break . Give *US* a break ! Pumping teargas for 45 minutes into a compound filled with CHILDREN ? ! ! This does n't seem to show much regard for their lives or safety . `` Nontoxic teargas '' is an oxymoron . Children have tiny respiratory passages which are easily blocked by the secretions induced by teargas ; moreover teargas can easily cause fatalities in anyone subject to laryngospasms , asthma , or heart disease . If a madman is holding a gun to a hostage , someone who provokes the madman by attacking him bears nearly as much repsonsibility for the death of the hostage as the madman himself . These kinds of situations have to be handled *delicately* - not by surrounding a place with tanks and heavily armed personnel and blaring rock music from loud- speakers at all hours . That approach is idiotic . > Be part of the solution - not the problem . The solution is to greatly reduce the authority of the `` the authorities '' . The Feds showed themselves here , as they have so many times in the past , to be a gang of trigger-happy , impulsive , yahoos who cause more trouble than they prevent . Their confrontational approach reinforced every single message Koresh was giving his followers , virtually guarantee- ing that whatever crazy solution Koresh proposed would be followed willingly . This was pointed out here , on Compuserve , in the press , just about every place except in the Justice Department where it seems a n.i.h . philosophy prevails . -- -peter

Nineteen full and half day tutorials and thirty-six technical sessions over three days provide huge amounts of information for X application developers .

Speakers at Xhibition 93 include : Bob Schiefler , Lu Abel , Mark Ackerman , Paul Asente , Doug Blewett , Donna Converse , Jim Fulton , Oliver Jones , Keith Packard , Ralph Swick , Doug Young , and many others . Xhibition is growing ( fortunately for us : - ) and we have added some additional conferences . Surveys that we have given have indicated additional topics of interest . These include : object oriented technologies such as the Object Management Group 's ORB and CORBA ; C++ as it applies to X ; client server technologies such as DCE ; threads ; databases- object oriented and relational ; and ( not surprisingly when you look at the audience ) Windows NT . With the bulk of the Xhibition audience ( and the UNIX community ) developing applications for in-house or custom use , a new 32-bit operating system from a player as large as Microsoft needs to be evaluated . With MS Windows on so many desktops , and the price of computing power dropping , its successor needs to be evaluated . As corporations begin to look at NT , so must their developers and suppliers . The mission of the Xhibition technical conferences is to provide information to the application developer and to the technology planner . The NT Conference at Xhibition is designed to do just that . We worked with Microsoft to provide the *only* conference this year specifically designed to show X and UNIX developers the capabilities of Windows and NT . If you are n't sure that NT has what you need for your application development or systems deployment , this is the place to find out . Ask the folks from Microsoft , get them to show you what you need . Conference attendees will receive NT Software Development Kits- to bang on , evaluate , and generally to see for yourself . I hope this does n't sound like an NT commercial ( it should sound like an Xhibition commercial : - ) . I just want to reiterate that the Xhibition audience is growing and Xhibition is growing along with it .

The % important , correct and legitimate resolution is incomplete since % it does not include operative statements designed to end Israeli % racial discrimination . Meanwhile the United States , on behalf of % Israel , are exerting heavy pressure on member states of the United % Nations to repeal this resolution and give Israeli racial % practices - Zionism - moral legitimacy . If you are , in principle , advocating UN intervention via operative statements in this case , it must therefore hold that they can be applied to any other case where the council perceives some form of racial discrimination as previously exhibited . Scarey thought . % The very definition of Israel as a State belonging to the Jews of % the world ( but not to its inhabitants ) , alienates all native % non-Jews born in that country . Actually , I know quite a few native non-Jews born in Israel that are not alienated by this law . If you had said some , you would probably be correct , however your tendency to exagerate and slant facts becomes apparent . This slant permeates the text . % Practically all non-Jews who are living in or originate from areas % under Israeli control , identify themselves as Palestinians .

If I recall correctly , at the time `` zionism '' took off , there was no adamant opposition in Palestine . I am open to any factual contradictory evidence . % But the % Zionists were more powerful , militarily , economically and % technologically , and succeeded in 1948 in conquering 70 % of the % area of Mandatory Palestine . After driving into exile most native % Arabs from the conquered areas , approximately 750,000 people , and % razing most of their villages to the ground , the Zionists could % finally establish a predominantly Jewish State . Only 150,000 % non-Jews remained on Israeli territory . Do you therefore contend that the 400 villages you mention further on `` most of their villages '' ? % Once the Jewish State was established , it began enacting laws to % help the confiscation of land from native non-Jews , their % political repression and their destitution . There is no doubt that laws passed provided a framework which was later used for these purposes . However , you seem to imply that this was the intention a priori , which implies a policy and agenda . My knowledge was that this was not the case . You also neglect to mention the circumstances that surrounded this . As you do again , below . % In 1967 the State of Israel invaded Egypt and Syria and occupied % the rest of Palestine ( the West Bank and the Gaza strip ) . Thus % another 1.5 million Palestinians fell under its juridiction . Its % occupation of Palestinian and other Arab territories is considered % illegal by the international community , as reflected in Security % Council resolutions . Israel has rejected all U.N. resolutions and % began without delay to entrench its occupation and rule over these % territories with the aim of annexing them at the appropriate time . Not quite accurate . Israel has not rejected all the resolutions , though it has conflicting understanding with regards to some of them . Israel never annexed the Sinai , West Bank , or Gaza . The other annexations were brought about partly due to the UN resolutions . % Part of these territores , East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights , % have already been forcefully annexed by Israel , in defiance of % international law and UN resolutions . Out of curiousity , provided that the annexees are granted citizenship , what int ' l law do you claim prohibits annexation of territories captured in war ? Has this ever been applied to any other country previously ( other than Iraq ) ? % It must be emphasized that , although these people live under % different regimes , they are united in their self-perception as % Palestinians , that is as people identifying with Palestine , a % territorial entity ( not an ethnic or religious entity ) . Incorrect ! Palestinians themselves claim to be discriminated against on an `` ethnic or racial '' basis . Therefore your above statement is incorrect . I also note that given the previous definition of racial discrimination , the only means that you could argue for that is nationalistically . However , no such nation has existed . It definitely did not exist at the time of the creation of Israel , in which case you can not argue racial discrimination during that period ! % Furthermore Palestinians generally consider the PLO both as a % symbol of national identity and as the unchallenged authority that % represents them in world affairs . Once again , some do , some do n't . % The non-Jewish population living in the Palestinian and other Arab % territories occupied by Israel in 1967 suffers not only blatant % discrimination but is subject to brutal military occupation . Another generalization , but then again , you do n't seem to care about anyone other than the Palestinian people , whose cause you espouse . % licence , to start a business and to buy industrial equipment , the % right to educate children , all of these basic rights are subject % to arbitrary rulings by military authorities and can not be % challenged in court . Incorrect once again . They have the ability to appeal . Furthermore , although you may not agree with them , not all of the military rulings are senseless or arbitrary . Some are , but this is not due to the `` whims '' of the military as much as the sizeof the task/organization . % Only Jewish inhabitants of the occupied % territories are permitted to carry firearms . Incorrect once again . I know two Arab policemen who lived in Daheisha and there were more . Of course , with the outbreak of the intifada they were forced by the locals to resign , bitterly . % Jewish settlers have % right to 6-7 more water per person than non-Jews . Jewish residents % of these territories number now about 100,000 people . It is Israel % governmentUs policy to increase this number substantially , in % total defiance of international law , UN resolutions and the will % of the population . The State of Israel systematically confiscates % land from non-Jewish inhabitants of these territories for Jewish % settlement . That is no longer true , and I ca n't help but wonder what your purpose is/was in posting this . % Some 800,000 people in Israel proper , are not Jews . Most of them % consider themselves Palestinians with Israeli citizenship . For % many years after the establishment of Israel they were subjected % to harsh military control . Much of their land was confiscated by % the State and handed to Jewish organisations for exclusive Jewish % settlement . They have been subject to massacres , destitution and % humiliation . While they enjoy , with Jewish Israelis , the right to % vote , they are discriminated against both through law and in % practice . Once again , to hell with the other minorities that do n't fit in , right ? Their are many villages who did not suffer in the way you seem to indicate , Abu Gosh comes to mind . Yes , some did but as a result of what actions ? % Approximately 92 % of the surface of the State of Israel within the % Rgreen lineS is for all purposes closed to Palestinians who are % second-class citizens in Israel . They may neither legally live on % such land , nor rent or cultivate it . A direct effect of these % policies is that native non-Jewish citizens of Israel are denied % residence and membership rights in most rural communities in % Israel , including the collective settlements , kibbutzim . Non-Jews % are discriminated against in many other ways : The Government % starves local authorities of Palestinian villages and townships of % funds ; Jewish city councils force Palestinians to live in ghettos ; % Jewish families receive higher child allocations than their % non-Jewish neighbors , Palestinian schools suffer underfunding and % understaffing ( as compared to Jewish schools ) ; Palestinian % children are denied the right to learn their history and % literature ; Israelis who struggle for equal rights and for the end % of racial discrimination , suffer continuous harassment by the % authorities . 1 . There are some kibbutzim with Arab/Non-Jewish members . It is up to the members of the kibbutz . There is no legislation against it , nor against a purely non-Jewish collective . 2 . Funds are the result of political lobbying . Bearing in mind that non_Jews compose ~20 % of the voting population , it has never failed to amaze me that they fail to form one large bloc , and increase their power . The recent elections are a case in point . 3 . Please provide factual evidence supporting your allegation with regard to educational material . You have obviously never seen the curriculum of a school in the West Bank . It is based upon Jordan 's school system . 4 . With regard to your last statement , it is simply another gross generalization . % The State of Israel refuses to acknowledge itself as the State of % all its inhabitants . Although the Israeli Cabinet has never % openly endorsed the 'transfer ' idea ( the forced removal from the % country of its native Palestinian population , that is , its % ultimate Judaization ) , Israeli government policies towards % non-Jews bear the mark of this 'Final Solution ' . No attempt is % made by the Zionist authorities to integrate Palestinian Arabs % into Israeli public life . Thus , although comprising approximately % 17 % of the population of Israeli citizens , no Palestinian citizen % of Israel has ever served as Cabinet member , as director of % ministry or of a national institution , as judge of the Supreme % Court , as ambassador of Israel , or in any leading position in % Israeli economic or financial life . Even the director of the % Ministry for Arab Affairs - yes , such a thing exists ! - is a Jew . Another generalization , but lets not stop here . The transfer idea was espoused by one party in the last gov't , Moledet . It was intended to be a solution to the problem in the territories , not the country itself . With regard to other items , I recall at least one Arab ambassador , and the rest was covered previously . % Although sexual % relations between and cohabitation of Jews and non-Jews are legal , % they are considered by Israeli/Zionist society somewhat a betrayal % of the Jewish and Zionist ethics . The Israeli educational system % nurtures this attitude in a systematic way . When was the last time you were in Israel ? That is simply not true , nor has it been for quite some time . The question of religious intervention is best answered by the proportional representation and the lack of any Arab party bloc to counter the orthodox one . % Zionism rejects the idea of a modern secular state , based on % equality of all citizens . This is one main reason why Israel has % not produced any written Constitution . Simply incorrect . The answer is political . Once again , your failure to understand the dynamics and movements inside Israeli gov't , relegates your contentions to the sidelines . % Zionism predicates a state % where Jews have privileged rights . Thus , according to Israeli law , % a Jew born in London , who has never visited Israel , does not speak % Hebrew and professes atheism , is granted automatic Israeli % citizenship , while native Palestinian inhabitants who happen to be % Christian or Muslim , are treated almost as aliens . Racial % discrimination , as defined in international law , is thus not only % reflected in Israeli laws and policies , but is grounded in the % very nature of Israel as a Jewish state . But the discrimination is not based upon race . Oops , sorry , nasty habit I have of countering malicious false truths . % Any proposal for Israeli-Arab and Israeli-Palestinian peace that % does not address the issue of racial discrimination by Israel - % that is the Zionist nature of the State of Israel - is thus doomed % to fail . Real world intrusion - any proposal that does is doomed to fail . Of course , I would n't expect you to understand , wrapped up as you are in your VIEW of things .

Yes , but Jesus also made a very general and doctrinal statement in the same conversation : '' Flesh gives birth to flesh , but the Spirit gives birth to spirit . '' ( John 3:6 ) Clearly infants are not born of the spirit . Thus , without baptism they are unspiritual . They are not born with the image of God , but in Adam 's fallen image ( cf . Gen 5:3 ) . They have no righteousness of their own , just as adults have no righteousness of their own . There is only the imputed righteousness of Christ , which believers receive through faith . Alan > 3 . We can ask ourselves why the Lord would even introduce the Alan > concept of spiritual re-birth through baptism if newborn babies Alan > were n't free from sin ? Your point is a little obscure here , but I think you are saying that Christ used the `` innocence '' of newborn babes as a metaphor for spiritual re-birth . But this is not what he did . If you look at the text , he did not speak of spiritual re-birth but of spiritual birth . We are born of the Spirit once , not twice or several times . We are also born of the flesh once . The Lord makes it clear that these are separate and different events . It is true that other Scriptures refer to spiritual birth as re-birth because it is a second birth ( for example , Titus 3:5 ) . But it is not a second *spiritual* birth . The only thing the two births have in common is the concept of birth , which is used as a symbol of ` new life ' -- not of innocence . When an infant is born ( or conceived ) a new life is begun -- but it is neither innocent nor righteous . Similarly when that same individual is baptized , or perhaps when they believe prior to baptism , they begin a new life in Christ ( Romans 6:3 , Colossians 2:12 , Titus 3:5 , Ephesians 2:5 ) . Then the believer has God 's assurance of the forgiveness of their sins , and of Christ 's imputed righteousness .

While this is true , there are fixes for those who have already bought Diamond cards . In Linux , for example , there are utilities that will put the card in VESA mode before invoking X . Of course , this means no fine tuning of Diamond cards , but at least this will allow those who 're stuck with them to use Linux+X .
