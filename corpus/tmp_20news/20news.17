From : dietz @ parody.Data-IO.COM ( Kent Dietz ) Subject : Bosox go down in smoke II ( Seattle 7-0 ) ... Organization : Data I/O Corporation Lines : 27 Oh , yea , and Chris Bosio pitched a NO-HITTER . One over the minimum , two bases on ball in the first inning , one runner left , 95 pitches . I listened to the game on radio and listening to Dave Niehaus call the game was a real treat ( as long as they keep Ron Fairly quite , I doubt if anyone is better than Niehaus -- but that Fairly guy is really annoying me ) . But , I guess if Clemens or Viola had been pitching , it would have been a different story : - ) Two shutouts in two nights against the hottest , best hitting team in Major League baseball ... . Pretty impressive in any league . Man , if Johnson , Bosio and Hanson keep going the Mariners could be a really interesting team to follow this year . Also , John Cummings ( rookie ) has had three solid outings with no support . If Fleming comes back this may be the best starting staff in the American League this year ( relief is another story , though - grimace ) . Too cool . The first no-hitter that I have been able to follow from start to end . And again , I think Niehaus will win some kind of award for the way he called the game . The guy is truly a joy to listen to -- he deserves a pennant race ... Kent Dietz Twins in '93 Mariners -- - If only they were an NL team ! Follow ?

Well , suppose a probe emitting radiation at a constant frequency was sent towards a black hole . As it got closer to the event horizon , the red shift would keep increasing . The period would get longer and longer , but it would never stop . An observer would not observe the probe actually reaching the event horizon . The detected energy from the probe would keep decreasing , but it would n't vanish . Exp ( -t ) never quite reaches zero .

So the `` No Power/Impatient '' guys have no excuse . The `` No Power/Patient '' guys are doing the right thing . Now the `` Impatient/Power '' guys ( how could you leave out the Big Cat ? ) . Would these guys have a better slugging percentage if they took more pitches ? Perhaps , but I doubt it . If you tell Joe Carter to go up there and take a few pitches , he will draw more walks , but he also wo n't hit as many frozen ropes into the bleachers because he is more likely to hold back on a pitch that he used to drive . The `` Patient/Power '' guys ? Joe Morgan had a small strike zone and Rickey Henderson has `` a strike zone the size of Hitler 's heart '' so they get their walks based on the small zone . Look at the other 5 guys : Thomas , Bonds , McGwire , Ruth and Williams . Wow ! A lot of pitchers would rather nibble at the corners and maybe walk these guys that to throw a clear strike to them . The pitchers would do better ( in my opinion ) by just coming after them with a good fastball for a strike on the first pitch , but pitchers would rather nibble , go 2-0 or 3-1 and then get hurt .

However , I 'm a developer at SAS Institute , and one component of the application that I support is the ability to submit a ( SAS ) batch job from within an interactive SAS session . The user site can enter their site-specific `` batch profile '' into a dataset within our product , specifying the pathname to the SAS executable , specifying site specific SAS options , etc . At run time certain variables are resolved , and the resolved file is written to an external ascii file . Then I exit to the operating system and run the job asynchronously , returning to the interactive session as soon as the job is submitted . The batch job then runs concurrently with the interactive session . As currently designed , the internal dataset has a record length of 80 characters . But , to run the batch job , the command to reinvoke SAS in batch mode requires more than 80 characters . Up til NT this has not been a problem , since every job control/shell language up til NT ( eg . MVS/CMS/VMS/UNIX/OS2 ) had a way to escape the CR/LF and enter a single command across multiple lines ( OS/2 via their REXX language , which is *STANDARD* with OS/2 ) . The gist of all this is , since this application is for end-users , not within my company , I have to try to develop this process using native NT . Since my first posting I 've learned that there are several third party companies that provide alternative script languages for Windows/Windows NT . And I 'm sure a company that licenses our product would use that alternative script language if they had it , but I ca n't develop under the assumption that they have anything other than what comes with NT . I saw another post on this list ( the subject was something like `` Is vi available for Windows ? '' ) in which someone said that vi , make , awk , and ***ksh*** was available with Microsoft TOOLKIT . What is that product ? Is it a separate product or part of Windows ? ksh would do what I need if I could count on it at all NT sites . One last question : I 've heard that NT has remote processing capabilities , i.e . I could shove this batch job off to a server machine and have it run there . If these are native NT commands rather than network specific commands , this would also help me improve this process . If you can comment on these commands , I would appreciate it .

But in case there are some misconceptions , I think Henry Robertson has n't updated his data file on Korea since ... mid 1970s . Owning a car in Korea is no longer a luxury . Most middle class people in Korea can afford a car and do have at least one car . The problem in Korea , especially in Seoul , is that there are just so many privately-owned cars , as well as taxis and buses , the rush-hour has become a 24 hour phenomenon and that there is no place to park . Last time I heard , back in January , the Kim Administration wanted to legislate a law requireing a potential car owner to provide his or her own parking area , just like they do in Japan . Also , Henry would be glad to know that Hyundai is n't the only car manufacturer in Korea . Daewoo has always manufactured cars and I believe Kia is back in business as well . Imported cars , such as Mercury Sable are becoming quite popular as well , though they are still quite expensive . Finally , please ignore Henry 's posting about Korean politics and bureaucracy .

Faith and dogma are dangerous because they cause people to act on faith alone , which by its nature is without justification . That is what I mean by the word `` faith '' : belief without justification , or belief with arbitrary justification , or with emotional ( irrational ) justification . For example , when someone says that God exists , that they do n't know why they believe God exists , they can just feel it , that 's faith . Dogma is bad because it precludes positive change in belief based on new information , or increased mental faculty . > > So Christians are totally irrational ? Irrational with respect to their > religion only ? What are you saying ? One 's belief in a Christian God does > not make one totally irrational . I think I know what you were getting at , > but I 'd rather hear you expand on the subject . Faith and dogma are irrational . The faith and dogma part of any religion are responsible for the irrationality of the individuals . I claim that faith and dogma are the quintessential part of any religion . If that makes ( the much overused in this context ) Buddism a philosophy rather than a religion , I can live with that . Science is not a religion , because there is no faith nor dogma . > > > A philosopher can not be a Christian because a philosopher can change his mind , > > whereas a Christian can not , due to the nature of faith and dogma present > > in any religion . > > Again , this statement is too general .

Would you assert that atheists > would make poor philosophers because they are predisposed to not believe in a > God which , of course , may show unfair bias when studying , say , religion ? Have you noticed that philosophers tend to be atheists ? If a philosopher is not an atheist , s/he tends to be called a theologian . A Christian tends to consider Christianity sacred . Christianity is a special set of beliefs , sanctioned by God himself , and therefore , to conceive of changing those beliefs is to question the existence of That Being Who Makes No Mistakes . Faith comes into play . Dogma comes into play . `` The lord works in mysterious ways '' is an example of faith being used to reconcile evidence that the beliefs are flawed . Sure , interpretations of what `` God said '' are changed to satisfy the needs of society , but when God says something , that 's it . It was said , and that 's that . Since God said it , it is unflawed , even if the interpretations are flawed . Science , ( as would be practiced by atheists ) in contrast , has a BUILT IN defence against faith and dogma . A scientist holds sacred the idea that beliefs should change to suit whatever is the best information available at the time , AND , *AND* , ****AND*** , a scientist understands that any current beliefs are deficient in some way . The goal is to keep improving the beliefs . The goal is to keep changing the beliefs to reflect the best information currently available . That 's the only rational thing to do . That 's good philosophy . Can you see the difference ? Science views beliefs as being flawed , and new information can be obtained to improve them . ( How many scientists would claim to have complete and perfect understanding of everything ? None -- -it would put them out of a job ! ) Religion views its beliefs as being perfect , and the interpretations of those beliefs must be changed as new information is acquired which conflicts with them . > > Please explain how `` just because '' thinking kills people .

From : richmond @ spiff.Princeton.EDU ( Stupendous Man ) Subject : Interstellar T _is_ 3-4K ; notes on Pluto/Charon talk and Pluto Mission Originator : news @ nimaster Keywords : I goofed Nntp-Posting-Host : spiff.princeton.edu Organization : Princeton University Lines : 73 ( sci.space readers can skip the first paragraph ) Yesterday , in response to Henry Spencer 's question about the temperature of a blackbody in interstellar space , I said `` Dust grains acts as blackbodies , and they 're at 40-150 K. '' Well , I was dead wrong . Our local interstellar dust expert , Bruce Draine , has informed me that dust grains _aren't_ good radiators in the far IR , which is why they are so warm ; actually , the ambient radiation field from distant stars can bring a true blackbody to only 3 or 4 Kelvin . Sorry , Henry , and anyone else I misled . Obviously , time for me to take another ISM class : - ( In other news , Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute gave a talk on the Pluto-Charon binary system yesterday . He gave a brief overview of the currently-accepted system parameters ( volume ratio of about 8:1 , mass ratio about 15:1 or so , plus lots more ... ) and then gave his thoughts on the formation of Pluto-Charon . His idea is that there were lots and lots of small planetesimals in the outer solar system , with masses distributed as a power law of some kind ; over time , the planetesimals accreted into larger bodies . Most got scattered out of the solar system by close encounters with Jupiter and Saturn , but many accreted into the gas giants , especially Uranus and Neptune . A large planetesimal was captured by Neptune - we call it Triton [ captured how ? Perhaps by a collision with a smaller , already-existing Neptunian moon , perhaps by a very close passage through Neptune 's atmosphere - mondo aerobraking ! ] . He notes that the two recently discovered `` Kuiper Belt '' objects , 1992 QB1 and 1993 FW , plus Chiron and Pholus , are all about the same mass , and he identifies this group as one-accretion-down from the larger bodies of Triton and Pluto/Charon . Pluto/Charon , he thinks , formed when an impacting body hit proto-Pluto , knocking some material into a ring around Pluto which later accreted in Charon ; similar to ideas about the formation of Earth 's moon . There is good evidence from spectra that the surfaces of Pluto and Charon are very different ( Pluto has methane frost , Charon does n't ) , which can be used as evidence for the impact theory . He believes that there may be around 1000 Pluto-to-Chiron-sized objects remaining in a relatively stable dynamical zone just outside Neptune 's orbit , beyond 35 AU or so . 1992 QB1 and 1993 FW are the first members of this population to be found , in his model . Note that such bodies will be very dark , since if their surfaces are covered with methane frost , it will have photolyzed into very dark , long-chain hydrocarbons by now . The reason that Pluto has such a high albedo ( around 0.5 , I think ) is that its surface warms up JUST enough around perihelion to sublimate , and when the atmosphere freezes out again , thirty years later , it forms bright , new frost . So any bodies much farther away than 30 AU are going to be very hard to see . I hope I have n't made any errors in the transcription ; if you see a howling mistake , it 's undoubtedly mine , not his . By the way , he 's one of the top guns behind the Pluto Fast Flyby mission ( I think ) , and said that the current plans are to use a Titan 4 to send the probe on `` just about a rectilinear trajectory '' to Pluto ( we were speaking loosely at the time ... ) . He 'd like to use a Proton , which gives a slightly smaller velocity but costs MUCH less . His figures : $ 500 Million for 2 Titan 4 launches ( there will be two separate probes , launched separately ) , or $ 120 Million for 2 Proton launches . He told a story about how the Soviets originally offered to sell Proton launches for $ 30 Million each , but were forced to increase their prices in the US in order to be allowed in the marketplace . I 'm just telling you what he said . Michael -- -- -- - Michael Richmond '' This is the heart that broke my finger . '' richmond @ astro.princeton.edu

I found that it upset the bike much less if I rode with the pilot , that is , if I looked over his shoulder and anticipated when I should hold on hard for braking or acceleration . I tried to always look over the inside shoulder on corners and move as little as possible , leaving Dave to manage me and the bike as he normally would the bike and luggage . Hard acceleration can be quite unnerving as the feeling of being spit off the back is hard to fight . Similarly , I held on to the grab handles tightly when Dave needed to brake so as not to mash him to a pulp ( I'm a lot bigger than he is ... ) . Reaching around him and pushing off the tank seemed like it would be very awkward and make it even harder for him to manage .

Well , I agree that if you 're going to stand in front of the net , that you should expect to get hit and hacked at . In general , you should expect to finish the game with some bruises . However , there is a fine line between hacking at a guy ( causing some pain and discomfort ) and blatantly attempting to injure another player . Felix Potvin , IMO , crossed that line on Wednesday . That two hander on Ciccarelli was way out of line . I lost a lot of respect for Potvin because of that . It showed an immaturity . He did not slash at Ciccarelli to simply try to remove him from the slot area ( a legal position for Dino to be in ) . Instead , he slashed in an attempt to injure . It was out of shear frustration . As a Leaf supporter ( just a supporter , I 'm not a Leaf fan really ) , I was very disappointed . You 're right in mentioning Billy Smith and Ron Hextall ( at least in his Philly days ) . They both crossed that same line at times and for that reason , many fans ( and players ) disliked them ( that's why their names always comes up as examples when we talk about these issues ) . Let 's hope that Felix does n't do that again . I'd hate to see anyone ( even Dino -- - although I admit I do n't like him very much ) get seriously hurt from such careless ( but intentional ) use of the stick . Gary

Both computers begin crashing frequently , locking up and ultimately the Memory Chimes . Crashes would almost always occur if you moved the screen and sometimes would occur when you were n't even touching the computer . In both cases , taking the machine apart , taking the memory out and putting it back in solved the problem for awhile but then it would comeback , my marginally educated guess as to what 's happening is that larger SIMMS are '' lopsided '' in that the insertion point is sort of a pivot point and after time they begin to move about - possible because of pressure on the keyboard or something ? Anyway , has anyone else had such a problem or solution - If somehow you could support the other end of the simm to prevent it from moving . I 've had no problem for the past 3 weeks by replacing my 8Mb simm with a 2Mbsimm -although this is NOT desireble solution . Please email any resp - and/or post if usefull to the rest of the world .

Not only are you moving data on a path twice as wide ( at least ) , but there is a difference in the number of clocks required for bus transactions between the two busses . Most ISA boards require multiple clocks per bus transaction -- typically this is around 3-4 . EISA boards are suppose to be able to 'burst ' at a 1:1 rate , so I would expect performance to be 6x-8x that of an ISA card . So I guess , for me , the question is unanswered still .

'' I do n't have a concordance here but I have > some dim memory that this appears *somewhere* in the Bible . > Given a fairly specific context for what judgement is , I 'd say > that more or less decides the issue . > > [ Heb 9:27 -- clh ] Indeed , the immediate context [ NASB ] is : 26 Otherwise , He would have needed to suffer often since the foundation of the world ; but now once at the consummation He has been manifested to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself . 27 And inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die once , and after this comes judgement ; 28 so Christ also , having been offered once to bear the sins of many , shall appear a second time , not to bear sin , tro those who eagerly await him . The first point is that this verse is part of an even larger context , the subject of which is not the destiny of the individual human soul but rather the singular nature of Christ's sacrifice , `` once '' , and the fulfillment of the law for all of fallen mankind . Rudolf Frieling elaborates this in detail in his '' Christianity and Reincarnation '' . The thrust of the passage in its context is to liken the one time incarnation and sacrifice of Christ for all mankind to the individual experience of the human being after death . The `` once '' is repeated and emphasized , and it highlights the singularity of Christ 's deed . One thing for certain it does is to refute the claims of some that Christ incarnates more than once . But the comparison to the human experience - die once , then judgement ( note : not `` the judgement '' , but just '' judgement '' . The word for judgement is `` krisis '' . Hebrews 9:27 is the one passage most often quoted in defense of the doctrine that the Bible denies reincarnation . At this point , I would just emphasize again that the passages that ( arguably ) speak against it are few , and that invariably they are talking about something eles , and the apparent denial of reincarnation is either inferred , or , as in the case of Hebrews , taken literally and deposited into an implied context , namely a doctrine of the destiny of the human being after death . What should be considered seriously is that the Bible is essentially silent about the fate of the individual human being between death and the Last Day . If you take the few passages that could possibly be interpreted to mean a single earth life , they are arguable . And there are other passages that point , arguably , in the other direc- tion . such as Matthew 11:14 and John 9:2 . We can continue to debate the individual scraps of scripture that might have a bearinig on this , and indeed we should discuss them . But what I wanted to introduce into the discussion was an approach to the idea of repeated earth lives that , unlike Hindu , Buddhist and `` new age '' teachings , takes full cognizance of the divinity , singular incarnation , death , burial , resurrection , and second coming of Christ as the savior of mankind ; the accountability of each individual for his deeds and the reality of the Fall and of sin and its consequences ; the redemption of man from sin through Christ ; the resurrection of the body , and the Last Judgement . Taken in this larger sense , many serious questions take on an entirely different perspective . E.g . the destiny of those who died in their sins before Christ came . the relationship of faith and grace to works , the meaning of `` deathbed conversion '' , the meaning of the sacraments , and many other things . Not that I propose to answer all those questions by a simple doctrine of convenience , but only that the discussion takes on a different dimension , and in my opinion one that is truly worthy of both man , the earth , and their Creator and Redeemer . There are many deep questions that continue to be deep , such as the meaning of the second death , and how the whole of Christian doctrine would apply to this larger perspective of human existence . There are those who deeply believe that the things of which the Bible does not speak are not things we should be concerned with . But Christ also indicated that there were other things that we would come to know in the future , including things that his disciples ( and therefore others ) could not bear yet . This idea that the human capacity for growth in knowledge , not only of the individual in one lifetime , but of the whole of humanity , also takes on great meaning when we realize that our growth in the spirit is a long term process . The Bible was not meant to codify all spiritual knowledge in one place forever , but to proclaim the gospel of the incarnation and redeeming deed of Christ - taking the gospel in the greater context , from Genesis to Revelation . Now , salvation ( healing ) becomes , not the end of man 's sojourn but its beginning . And the Last Judgement and the New Heaven and Earth that follow it become its fulfullment .

From : steph @ pegasus.cs.uiuc.edu ( Dale Stephenson ) Subject : Hits Stolen -- Left Field 1992 Keywords : defense left Organization : University of Illinois , Dept . of Comp . Sci. , Urbana , IL Lines : 105 Disclaimer -- This is for fun . In my computerized baseball game , I keep track of a category called '' stolen hits '' , defined as a play made that `` an average fielder would not make with average effort . '' Using the 1992 Defensive Averages posted by Sherri Nichols ( Thanks Sherri ! ) , I 've figured out some defensive stats for the leftfielders . Hits Stolen have been redefined as `` Plays Kevin Bass would not have made . '' OK , I realize that 's unfair . Kevin 's probably the victim of pitching staff , fluke shots , and a monster park factor . But let 's put it this way : If we replaced every leftfielder in the league with someone with Kevin 's 49.4 % out making ability , how many extra hits would go by ? To try and correlate it to reality a little more , I 've calculated Net Hits Stolen , based on the number of outs made compared to what a league average fielder would make . By the same method I 've calculated Net Extra Bases ( doubles and triples let by ) . Finally , I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution , or DCON : - > . Basically , it represents the defensive contribution of a player . I add this number to OPS to get DOPS ( Defense + Onbase Plus Slug ) , which should represent the player 's total contribution to the team . So don't take it too seriously . The formula for DCON appears at the end of this article .

The opinions expressed are those of the user and not necessarily those of Oracle . Lines : 60 I recently corrected the resolution on my Sparcstation by changing /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers from : :0 local /usr/bin/X11/X :0 -ar1 500 -dpi 100 to : :0 local /usr/bin/X11/X :0 -ar1 500 -dpi 85 I determined that my 19 '' 1152x900 monitor was 85 dpi by measuring the active screen area and dividing by resolution . However , this has caused my application fonts to behave strangely . After some research , I believe this is caused by my applications requesting fonts by Family , Weight , Slant , and Pointsize . I believe that X is grabbing the first font on the path with these characteristics and displaying it . Since I have only 75dpi and 100dpi fonts on my path , the results are inaccurate . I do have some Speedo fonts , but not for the family I am using ( Helvetica ) . I think this is incorrect . The fonts should always be provided in the resolution of the display . This never seems to happen unless you explicitly request fonts by xres and yres ! This is true of both the scaleable and bitmapped fonts ! For instance , the command xfd -fn '-bitstream-charter-*-*-*-*-*-240-*-*-*-*-*-*' Will invoke a 75dpi font ( despite the fact that this is a Speedo font ) . The command xfd -fn '-adobe-courier-*-*-*-*-*-240-*-*-*-*-*-*' Will invoke a 75dpi font or a 100dpi font ( depending on my font path ) . Despite the fact that X knows my display is 85 dpi , and that it can generate an 85dpi font for me ! Unless I my applications specifies a resolution , X appears to pick a stupid default . Is this a bug ? Is it a feature ? If so , why ? Is there anything I can do to get around this problem ? People have suggested that I lie about my resolution , and specify a single font path ( 75 or 100 , not both ) . This would at least make my app consistent , but I like being able to look at rulers that appear in my paint application and say : `` Yup , thats an inch '' .

Goggin ) writes : > > I 'd like to get your comments on a question that has been on my mind a > lot : What morals/ethics apply to dreams and out-of-body incidents ? Dave - you might like to read a book by Florence Bulle `` God Wants You Rich & Other Enticing Doctrines '' , which discusses OOBEs in one of her chapters . In the Bible we have examples of men caught up in the Spirit ( eg Ezekiel , Paul ) . I believe that also this experience is counterfeited by Satan - so that for example yoga and other eastern medatitive techniques can be used to induce the soul to leave the body and float off . Someone tried to sell me a book in Los Angeles airport entitled `` Easy Journeys to Other Planets '' which uses such techniques . The occultic trance of a medium sometimes involves such body departure - the book `` The Challanging Counterfeit '' , about a former medium who gets saved , tells how the author , on his last trance , was attacked by evil spirits who tried to kill him while returning to his body at the end of the seance because of his interest in Christianity and how he was supernaturally protected by the Lord . There may be some similarities in mind-altering drugs and the phenomena of 'tripping ' . As regards the connection between body and soul , there is an interesting verse in Ecclesiastes . In a passage talking about old age , the preacher writes `` Then man goes to his eternal home and mourners go about the streets . Remember Him -- before the silver cord is severed . '' ( 12.5-6 ) My understanding of this silver cord is that it is something that attaches body and soul in a manner somewhat similar to an umbilical cord or an astronaut 's air-line to his spaceship . When a person goes out of body this silver cord still attaches the soul whereever it goes - and is vulnerable to being broken : astral projection can be dangerous ! Bulle , I think , reports a case of a yogi off on an OOBE who was found dead in his apartment , with no apparent external cause .

There are at least two meanings of the word `` once '' . 1 ) only one time , and 2 ) at some other time ( i.e . once upon a time ) . Note that in the previous verse , the word `` once '' is used with the second meaning , and also in the following verse , `` once '' is again used with the second meaning . The Greek , I am sure , uses different words for each of the two meanings for the English word `` once '' . I am not a Greek scholar , but I 'm sure someone here can verify which Greek word is used here for this meaning . If the second meaning is being used , that verse can be interpreted as : - for it was once given for men to die ( beginning with Adam ) , but after this [ gift of atonement offered by Jesus Christ ] the judgement [ is made available ] , for now there is no longer death , but life with Christ . -- =========================================================================== Daniel Cossack | danc @ procom.com , 71333.2102 @ compuserve.com Senior Software Engineer | 2181 Dupont Drive , Irvine , CA 92715 Procom Technology , Inc. | +1 714 852 1000

She had to ask the 'Lady ' several times in her apparitions about what her name was since her confessor priest asked her to do so . For several instances , the priest did not get an answer since Bernadette did not receive any . One time , after several apparitions passed , The Lady finally said , `` I am the Immaculate Conception '' . So , Bernadette , was so happy and repeated these words over and over in her mind so as not to forget it before she told the priest who was asking . So , when she told the priest , the priest was shocked and asked Bernadette , `` Do you know what you are talking about ? '' . Bernadette did not know what exactly it meant but she was just too happy to have the answer for the priest . The priest continued with , `` How did you remember this if you do not know ? '' . Bernadette answered honestly that she had to repeat it over and over in her mind while on her way to the priest ... The priest knew about the dogma being four years old then . But Bernadette did not know and yet she had the answer which the priest finally observed and took as proof of an authentic personal revelation of Our Lady to Bernadette .

The only thing I remember about my team is that I had Joe Sacco and maybe John MacLean . Maybe Francis and Kevin Stevens as well . Out of curiousity I checked the final standings today on r.s.h. , only to find to my amazement that with absolutely no input , the initial team still managed to finsh 79th ! I 'm not sure what that implies for those who finished below me : ) Ciao .

I have to wonder about the intelligence of signing a 33-year old who is obviously on the downside of his career to a 4-year $ 2 million contract . Risebrough matched the offer on King 's request and Makarov has spent the last quarter of the season in the press box because his work ethic just plain stinks . Not to mention that he 's lost a step and can no longer get himself into position to make the nifty passes . I think Makarov will be available for free this offseason to anybody who agrees to pay his contract . He 's ineffective in Calgary , but he might be able to help a team like San Jose , with their shortage of talent . If there 's no takers , and Makarov does n't show improvement in training camp , I think the Flames will just bite the bullet and buy out Makarov 's contract and release him .

From : choman @ rajeesh.WPI.EDU ( Charles Stanley Homan ) Subject : RBI Question Organization : Worcester Polytechnic Institute Lines : 27 NNTP-Posting-Host : rajeesh.wpi.edu Is there any judgement call on the part of the scorer for sac fly RBI 's ? This is the situation that brought the question up : The Red Sox were up in the bottom of the 9th by a score of 5-1 . The Mariners had the bases loaded with 1 out . The batter hits a fly to center , which the fielder catches . The runner at third tags and scores without a throw . Now , without a judgement call ( and I do n't think there is one ) , this is an RBI for the batter . It seems to me that a better name for this would be `` defensive indifference '' , since it does n't really matter whether the guy at third scores at that point . ( I know , I can think of several `` If the Mariners stole third and second , which opening the base would allow , and then the batter hit a grounder which the third baseman gets deep in the hole between himself and third , he would n't have a play at home , third , or second for the out , and maybe he therefore ca n't make the throw to first to get the last out , etc ... scenarios , too . But does it _really_ matter if this guy scores this way when you 're down by 4 ? If the tying run is going to score , so is the guy on third . ) The point is that the batter ( IMO ) should n't get `` credit '' ( an RBI ) for utterly failing to do his job - which at this point is to get a hit or a walk , not trade an out for one run .

There is also the possibility that lung tissue in patients with lung disease has become calcified ( chest x-rays would show this ) . There are side -effects to the use of EDTA because it is not specific for calcium ( it also binds other minerals ) . I think that there have been some deaths when EDTA chelation therapy has been used because of mineral imbalances that were not detected and corrected . In animal studies , the best way to remove calcium from plaques in rabbits was to supplement the rabbits with vitamin C and magnesium ( rabbits already synthesize their own vitamin C , the extra vitamin C was given in their diets to help the magnesium displace the calcium from the plaques ) . The calcification process that occurs in both plaques and the lung probably can be prevented if magnesium is used in supplemental form . Most patietns with calcium deposits are found to be deficient in calcium . 1 . `` Magnesium interrationships in ischemic heart disease : A review '' Am J Clin Nutr 27 ( 1 ) :59-79 ( 1974 ) . Supplementation with magnesium will prevent clacification of blood vessels . 2 . `` The importance of magnesium deficiency in cardiovascular disease '' Am . Heart J 94:649-57 ( 1977 ) . The need to measure the serum concentration in all patients with heat disease can not be overemphasized . This is a review article . 3 . `` Effect of dietary magnesium on development of atherosclerosis in cholesterol-fed rabbits '' Atherosclerosis 10:732-7 ( 1990 ) . Magnesium supplementation greatly decreased the formation of plaques in rabbits feed a diet that had 1 % by weight cholesterrol added to their normal food . Since EDTA will also bind magnesium , I 've never really liked it 's use for the reversal of athersclerosis or now apparently in emphesema patients . Marty B .

If player A hits better on Tuesdays and always has , and Mark believes that it might be an indication that he will hit on Tuesday better next season as well , would you respond the same way ? At some point you might admit that all variable might not be known to you ( who knows what this guy does every Monday night ? Maybe he sees his sports shrink on Tuesday mornings , or has his Vitamin B shots Monday nights ? ) But this is something that 's true of one guy only . It doesn't mean that there will be a meaningful correlation for the entire league by days of the week , nor that there should be . But it doesn't mean we ca n't make predictions based on that for that particular player . > > I believe that by > > season 's end that Chris Sabo 's batting average in clutch situations > > will be significantly lower than his batting average in non-clutch > > situations .

Unless there is reason to expect consistency , a Huh ? What does gambler 's fallacy have to do with anything ?

From : mcarr @ austin.onu.edu ( Michael Carr ( x1723 ) ) Subject : Digital- > AC Scaling Organization : Ohio Northern University X-Newsreader : TIN [ version 1.1 PL9 ] Lines : 28 Being in the `` visualization '' stage of a circuit design right now , I was wondering what the best way to `` scale '' an AC voltage using an 8-bit digital word is . I am thinking of using the common method of sending the word through an ADC and then comparing it with the AC voltage ( converted to a sawtooth wave ) to get a duty cycle . However , I am leary of this method because it a ) requires a lot of parts , and , more importantly , b ) creates a lot of interference from the switching on the entire AC line . I realize that correct filtering could cancel out most of this interference , but that would require more parts and boost the price further . Someone mentioned to me that they had seen an IC which input 8 bits of data and DIRECTLY scaled the AC voltage coming in all on-chip . Unfortunately , he could n't remember the chip number or the manufacturer ; if anyone else has heard of this chip , please e-mail me . I am building this project as a `` dimmer box '' for a light controller circuit and it is important that the cost of each box remains very low because one dimmer is required for each light that the user wishes to control ( well , each channel , at least ) . Therefor , if each box costs $ 150 , I doubt that an end user will want to dish out ( $ 150 x 16 = $ 2400 ) for sixteen channels ... This is something I have noticed about today 's dimmer boxes ; they are so expensive ! Anyway , any help which someone could offer on either a method of easily doing this or info about the chip which will do it for me ( always the preferred method ... : ) will be greatly appreciated !

Using the Sound Manager on a Quadra is very well , but using SM on any of the low-end machines does n't simply work for a decent action game since it just steals too much time from the CPU . This is a fact . By writing directly to the hardware on an SE , it is possible to have 4 simultaneous channels of sampled sound ( 11kHz ) for a cost of approx . 8000 cycles . Exactly how would you do that using the SM , pray tell ? The correct thing to do is to use the SM on the machines that can carry that extra load using the SM means , and to write directly to the sound hardware on the machines that ca n't . It 's not the politically correct thing , but from the developers ' point of view it is .

Advantages stated of circumcison included probably prevention of penile cancer , ( which , interestingly , occurs mostly in men whose personal hygiene is exceptionally poor ) , simplicity of personal hygiene , prevention of urinary tract infections , and prevention of a unretractible foreskin , Disadvantages include infection from the procedure , pain , etc . I apologize ; I am trying to pull this off the top of my head . I will post what I discovered in research ; I did a paper on the topic in my research class in Nursing school . It really is a decision that is up to the parents . Some parents use the reasoning that they will `` look like Daddy '' and like their friends as justification . There is nothing wrong with this ; just be sure it is what you want to do , since it is rather difficult to uncircumcise a male , although a major surgical procedure exists . > How about the pregnant woman sitting in a tub of water ?

Therefore we were created , and > therefore there exists a Creator . I hesitate to comment on the validity of this , because I do not know what your friend meant by it . If he meant that whatever exists must have been created , then he is open to the obvious retort that God exists , and so God must have been created . Perhaps your friend meant that we exist now but that there was a time when we did not exist , and therefore something other than ourselves must have brought us into existence . This seems plausible , but an atheist might reply , `` So my parents engendered me . So what ? '' Here your friend would have to explain why an infinite regress of causes is not a satisfactory explanation . He would have some support from philosophers who are not ordinarily considered religious ( Ayn Rand , and some others who are in the tradition of Aristotle ) . Having argued for a First Cause , he would have to bridge the gap between said entity and the God of Abraham . If he merely asserts that the things we observe are ultimately dependent on things radically unlike them , few physicists would disagree . Yours , James Kiefer

This tracks the thread `` why people do n't need strong crypto ... .. '' The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 expressly forbids *thinking* about building nuclear devices . While I was in grad school , a friend of mine got a security clearance to work on the defense for the Progressive magazine . He found lots of articles which were public domain *removed* from the local engineering library ( Madison Wisconsin ) . So the lawyers sent him all over the states to other libraries to show that the information in the article was already public . What pissed everyone off was a local underground paper went and published the article anyway ( it had been precensored by the feds , that 's what this was all about ) so the judge declared the case moot . The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 has never been tested in court . From my discussions with several people familiar with the case , only 2 other times has this preemptive clause been used . In every case the people simply did what they felt like and courts tossed the cases out . For all intents and purposes , the government *does* have precidence for declaring things classified *after* it has been published . While I was working on Star Wars this happened to me : my clearance was in the works and I developed a method for tracking particle beams . It was good enough to classify , so I was no longer allowed to work on it . A friend from Canada was in the same boat : he developed a method to compute stripping cross sections , but because the subject was classified *he was not allowed to present his own paper at a conference ! * . He later published it in an open journal without problems . When the going gets wierd , the wierd turn pro . The feds can do whatever they want whenever they feel like it , and they will make up rules to let themselves get away with it . Since the mass media ca n't tell the difference between a joke and the real thing ( like `` ranch appocolypse '' for the Waco massacre ) do n't count on them to help spread the word about their loss of freedom . The government *can* make strong crypto illegal . SO WHAT ? Since the government does not obey any of its own rules , why should we ?

When Quinn took over Vancouver- several years ago , NOT LAST YEAR , they regularily missed the playoffs . I ca n't recall if they missed the playoffs the year before his hiring but they probably did . Quinn has improved the team from non-playoff calibre to a serious contender . When Murray took over in Detroit , the were about a .500 team that was a contender to win the Norris division and possibly even a Stanley Cup contender . So Quinn has improved his team more than Murray has since taking over as a GM . Quinn is one example of a better GM than Murray . Gregmeister

I can not accept this ridiculous leap in logic . Technology is neutral to good or evil . When technology is used by `` evil '' men , it is called evil technology . When it is used by `` good '' men , it is called good technology .

The lengthier games > are so because of batters stepping out of the box , pitchers taking > longer between pitches and excessive trips to the mound by managers > and pitching coaches . > Until six or seven years ago I was an enthusiastic fan of NFL football . Last year I hardly watched a game . What turned me off were the incessant interruptions to the continuity of the game . A team scores . 2.5 minutes of commercials . Kickoff . 1.5 minutes of commercials . Three downs and a punt . 2 minutes of commercials . AAAAARRRRGH ! Earlier in this thread I commented on LaRussa and the A 's , whom I believe institutionalize slow play . I do n't mind the cat-and-mouse game with Rickey on first ; in fact , I rather enjoy it . Similarly I would enjoy the battle with Listach or Lofton or Polonia on first . What I object to is when such games are played with Karkovice on first , or when the game is a blowout . I do n't mind when the pitcher steps off the mound to gather his thoughts in a crucial situation , or when a hitter steps out of the box to regain his concentration . What I object to is when hitters and pitchers take such breaks at every opportunity . When a game is exciting , these little delays serve as tension builders and for me enhance the value of the experience of the game . When the delays happen with regularity , they become nuisances , just like the commercial breaks in football . I understand the NFL imposed a number of rule changes to `` speed up '' the games , basically putting an onus on the officiating staff to move the markers and the ball to the spots faster . That did not address the problem of the continuity of the game . It may have appeased the sponsors and the networks , but I would be amazed if it did anything to enhance the experience of the fans . Similary , while some 3-hour baseball games bore me to tears , those are the ones where there is no continuity and the players are taking exasperatingly long periods to get ready for each pitch . I doubt if anyone watching the Braves-Giants game cared about Gant stepping out . I doubt if anyone watching that game would have found that pause to be anything but an opportunity to have their complete attention claimed by the drama that was present . I would be totally opposed to any effort that would eliminate that aspect of baseball .

Even the old 84 Civic we keep as a beater feels better in this aspect . Note that these are cars with 250,000 kms and 140,000 kms respectively . My 90 Prelude blows both of them away in every respect except smooth clutch engagement . Of course the Kawasaki is the best of the bunch but I need more than 2 wheels most of the time . The Prelude has had a dud clutch from day 1 , and after three years and 67,000 kms is no better . Best of luck and feel free to add this to your collection . Jeff Goss

I do believe that for once you may have an argument which may be discussed intelligently ! I guess that you are a person who dislikes contact with people of ethnic minority . However , your argument again falls flat on its face . You state that you , under an anti-discrimination bill , would be forced to associate with others [ homosexuals , I assume ] against your will . How do you know that you do not associate with them now , except they may be closeted ? Would you like to change your argument to read `` forced to associate with truthfully homosexual people against my will '' ? You have no proof that anyone you now know may not be homosexual and this punches a large hole in your argument .

Perhaps because there is a connection here that is not there in the Mexican variant you bring up . That is , many ( not all ) extreme fundamentalist Christians use the excuse of teaching their children Biblical morality to justify this sort of mistreatment . I do not see many Mexicans using their Mexican heritage as an excuse for abuse . It is indeed this judgemental , controlling legalism of many fundamentalist Christians that has led me to reject that branch of our faith as not true to the Gospel of Christ , the gospel of love . I have seen this sort of thing too often , even amoung my own relatives , to believe there is no relationship . Judgementalism often leads to overly strict , and thus abusive , discipline of children .

Well , regardless of what policy liabilities anyone in Washington may think EFF has , it is going ahead aggressively attacking the assumptions that are behind the Administrations Clipper Chip initiative .

It 's true that a hydraulically pressurized tube can be somewhat more rigid than an unpressurized tube , but even at 2000 PSI levels a hydraulic hose will bend rather easily , though it 's straight-on compressive strength is high , and it 's torsional resistance increase is practically nil . On the other grasping member , there 's no doubt that hydraulic `` leverage '' exists in nature . Tree roots are an example .

Kangaroos 3-limbed ? I do n't think so . If you take the view that the tail is a limb , then monkeys and kangaroos are 5-limbed . I think the tail is a different kind of structure , grossly enlarged in the case of the kangaroo , but primarily still an instrument of balance rather than locomotion . I do n't know much about panda `` thumbs '' , so I 'll ask is it opposable ? > > Thermodynamic considerations of surface/volume relationships would > > seem to dictate that active complex creatures stay in a size range > > similar to what we see about us . 6 inch tall intelligent aliens > > seem unlikely , as do those much larger than the elephant . > > Why ca n't a lemur or a brontosaurus* be intelligent ? > > [ *Yes , I know that the brontosaurus is a mythical beast produced by > putting the head of another dinosaur on an apatosaurus , but so far > space aliens are also mythical . ] Well I wo n't say flat out that they ca n't be intelligent , but I'll bring a couple of lines of argument to bear to try to show why I do n't think it 's likely . First let me say that when I say `` intelligent '' I mean complex behaviors in response to novel situations on a level with , or greater than , human tool use and tool building . IE assuming suitable manipulators are present on the creature to allow it to alter it 's enviroment in a planned way , it will do so . That 's certainly not a universal or complete definition of intelligence , but it will suffice for a putative technological alien . Now no one knows exactly what makes a brain capable of thought , but it 's generally accepted that one of the criteria is a certain level of complexity . This is generally determined by the number of neuron cells , and their interconnections . So a creature the size of a lemur would n't have enough neurons to support complex thought . This argument is considerably less clear in the case of the dinosaur . There 's room for a large brain , though no indication that one ever developed . One reason this may be true is neuronic speed . The electrochemical messages that trigger neurons require time to propagate . This makes it difficult for a highly complex central brain to coordinate the movements of very large creatures . So there 's little selection pressure for such brains . Instead , a simpler distributed network evolves . This does n't rule out intelligent dinosaurs , but it points in that direction . Then there are the thermodynamic arguments . A tiny creature like the lemur needs to eat frequently because it 's internal heat is rapidly lost due to it 's high surface to volume ratio . I contend that a creature that must spend most of it 's time and energy feeding wo n't have the time to develop and exercise intelligence . That argument may be somewhat weak . The dinosaur 's problem is the reverse , it must moderate it 's heat production because it 's high volume to surface ratio makes it tend to retain waste heat . I 'm assuming that a certain temperature range is optimal for chemical reactivity reasons for productive neuron function . So creatures would tend to need to maintain a regulated temperature in a range near that of humans if they are carbon based . That tends to rule out cold blooded creatures as potential homes of intelligence . Some people contend that some of the dinosaurs may have been warm blooded . But for a creature the size of a brontosaur , it 's activity levels would have to be restrained or it would be prone to generate an internal steam explosion from the waste heat . Whales are similar size , but they can reject heat to the ocean , a much more efficient sink than air . I suspect that for intelligence to manifest itself , a certain degree of activity in interacting with the environment is necessary . IE monkey curiousity . I doubt a large dinosaur would be capable of that much activity .

From : Center for Policy Research < cpr @ igc.apc.org > Subject : Rabin and his Palestinians kapos Nf-ID : # N : cdp:1483500382:000:3586 Nf-From : cdp.UUCP ! cpr May 15 05:01:00 1993 Lines : 85 From : Center for Policy Research < cpr > Subject : Rabin and his Palestinians kapos Rabin 's plans for a Palestinian police ( from The Other Front , Alternative Information Center , Jerusalem , 5 May 1993 ) '' The decision to view the setting up of a local police force for ( sic ) the Palestinians as the central issue for deliberation at the peace talks to be resumed next week - even before subjects like elections in the territories and areas of juridiction in the framework of autonomy - is a sign of the Israeli government 's serious attitude towards the peace process . `` The setting up of a police force is not part of the 'gesture package ' , but deals with the very heart and substance of the Palestinian struggle for national identity . As it turns out , the main objective guiding the prime minister in the setting up of a Palestinian police force - and apparently also supported by Foreign Minister Shimon Peres - is to ensure the holding of democratic elections in the territories . '' Thus writes Amnon Barzilai in his editorial ( Israeli daily Hadashot , 23 April ) , and his position articulates the thinking of most of the commentators who dealt with this issue in the past two weeks . Over against them stand the settlers and rightwing parties , who also interpret the decision to encourage the establishment of a Palestinian police force as a significant step towards the instituting of real autonomy , something which will restrict what can be done by the Jewish settlers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip . With a variety of demonstrations , including street theater on 'What will happen when there is a Palestinian police force ' , rightwing elements are attempting to frighten the Israeli public and to pressure Rabin to go back on his decision . Members of the Kach movement have even begun to organize a 'settler police force ' in the Occupied Territories , as counter-balance to the future Palestinian police force . However , as Barzilai points out , the main function of the new police force - as far as the Israeli government is concerned - has nothing to do with the settlers , over whom they will apparently have no authority , but will control political groups within the Palestinian population , whom the government is interested in neutralizing . Writes Barzilai : '' ... According to ideas currently taking shape , the setting up of a local police force in the territories will precede , not only the stage of electsion , but also the final stages of the preparing of the interim autonomy agreement . `` The willingness of the Israeli government to set up a local Palestinian police force is evidence that the government is serious about arriving at a settlement with the Palestinians ... '' It 's no wonder that the Palestinian public is also greatly worried about this new Israeli initiative . And it is inevitable that pressure will be brought to bear on Faisal Husseini and the rest of the delegation members , from a variety of directions , to refuse the gift which Rabin would like to give them . But at this stage , it looks like the Palestinians are cooperating in the fulfillment of his plans . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Add ' l comment by E.D . : Numerous Palestinians fear that Israel might succeed in co-opting some Palestinian circles by this idea . They fear that a Palestinian police force , controlled in fact by Israel , might act even more brutally than the IDF . The idea of using a surrogate police force is not new . It is used by Israel in Lebanon and was used by the Nazis to control Jewish ghetto-dwellers .

You may consider that I am a complete bastard and a not very nice chap . Thats quite true . I do n't pretend to be . Being nice is what amateurs try to do . If you want to talk politics you are talking hard decisions such as whether the lives of the troops should be risked attempting to rescue the children . Anyone who has held the office of President of the United States since FDR has held the threat that if the USA or its allies were to be threatened then the USA would risk nuclear Holocaust in order to protect freedom . Beleive it or not , that is not the sort of threat that nice chaps make . Do they have a gun nutters section of the US version of CND by any chance ? There are cases where society has to be protected from madmen such as Koresh or Hitler . If it were not for the consideration of the 17 children in there the question of the tactics to be used would not be a matter of anything but academic significance . It is not for the govt to prevent people from commiting mass suicide . The latest reports are that cult members were shot attempting to leave the compound by Koresh loyalists during the fire . If proven that would entail the final nail in the coffin of those who want to promote Koresh as some sort of role model or hero . I need hardly add that it is Koresh that has created the Holocaust in this case by the deliberate arson of the ranch appocalypse . Phill Hallam-Baker

From : `` nigel allen '' < nigel.allen @ canrem.com > Subject : New Method For Diagnosing Alzheimer 's Disease Discovered Reply-To : `` nigel allen '' < nigel.allen @ canrem.com > Organization : Canada Remote Systems Distribution : sci Lines : 113 Here is a press release from Huntington Medical Research Institutes . New Method For Diagnosing Alzheimer 's Disease Discovered at Huntington Medical Research Institutes : Results to Be Reported To : National Desk , Health Writer Contact : John Lockhart or Belinda Gerber , 310-444-7000 , or 800-522-8877 , for the Huntington Medical Research Institutes . LOS ANGELES , April 28 -- A new method for diagnosing and measuring chemical imbalances in the brain which lead to Alzheimer 's disease and other dementias has been discovered by researchers at the Huntington Medical Research Institutes ( HMRI ) in Pasadena , Calif . Results of their research will be reported in the May issue of the scientific journal , Radiology . Using an advanced form of magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) called magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) , a research team led by Brian D. Ross , M.D. , D . Phil. , conducted a study on 21 elderly patients who were believed to be suffering from some form of dementia . The exams used standard MRI equipment fitted with special software developed at HMRI called Clinical Proton MRS. Clinical Proton MRS is easily applied , giving doctors confirmatory diagnoses in less than 30 minutes . An automated version of Clinical Proton MRS called Proton Brain Examination ( PROBE ) reduces the examination time yet further , providing confirmatory diagnoses in less than 10 minutes . By comparison , the current `` standard of care '' in testing for Alzheimer 's disease calls for lengthy memory function and neuropsychological tests , which can be very upsetting to the patient , are not definitive and can only be confirmed by autopsy . In addition to Alzheimer 's disease , the new Clinical Proton MRS exam may have applications in diagnosing other dementias , including AIDS-related dementia , Parkinson 's disease and Huntington's disease . `` We 've developed a simple test which can be administered quickly and relatively inexpensively using existing MRI equipment fitted with either the MRS or PROBE software , '' said Dr. Ross , adding , '' this will help physicians to diagnose Alzheimer 's earlier and intervene with therapeutics before the progression of the disease causes further damage to the delicate inner workings of the brain . '' Dr. Ross and his HMRI team measured a family of chemicals in the brain known as inositols , and myo-inositol ( MI ) acted as a marker in the study . In comparison to healthy patients , those diagnosed with Alzheimer 's showed a 22 percent increase in MI , while their level of another chemical called N-acetylaspartate ( NAA ) was significantly lower , indicating a loss of brain-stimulating neurons believed to be associated with the progression of the disease . Current drug therapy for Alzheimer 's disease is widely considered to be inadequate . This is attributable , Dr. Ross believes , to the theory that Alzheimer 's is caused by an interruption in the transmission of the chemical acetylcholine to the nerve cells . This belief has been adhered to over the last 15 years , and consequently , most drugs to treat Alzheimer 's were based on the changing receptors for acetylcholine . `` Physicians have a real need for a test to differentiate Alzheimer 's from other dementias , to provide the patient and his or her family with a firm diagnosis and to monitor future treatment protocols for the treatment of this disease . For this reason , we consider this test a major advancement in medicine , '' said Bruce Miller , M.D. , a noted neurologist at Harbor-UCLA , MRS researcher and a co-author of the study . Other members of the HMRI research team included Rex A. Moats , Ph.D. , Truda Shonk , B.S. , Thomas Ernst , Ph.D. , and Suzanne Woolley , R.N . The PROBE software can be fitted on the approximately 1,200 General Electric MRI units currently in use in the United States , and will be configured for other manufacturers ' MRI units soon . For interviews with Dr. Ross , advance copies of the Radiology May issue , and other information , please contact John Lockhart or Belinda Gerber for HMRI at 310-444-7000 or 800-522-8877 . Q & A on Alzheimer 's Disease : What is Alzheimer 's disease and how is it caused ? Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) is an incurable degenerative disease of the brain first described in 1906 by the German neuropathologist Alois Alzheimer . As the disease progresses , it leads to loss of memory and mental functioning , followed by changes in personality , loss of control of bodily functions , and , eventually , death . How many people does it affect ? Alzheimer 's disease affects an estimated 4 million adults in the United States and is the fourth leading cause of death , taking approximately 100,000 lives each year . While Alzheimer's debilitates its victims , it is equally devastating , both emotionally and financially , for patients ' families . AD is the most common cause of dementia in adults . Symptoms worsen every year , and death usually occurs within 10 years of initial onset . What are its signs and symptoms ? Although the cause of AD is not known , two risk factors have been identified : advanced age and genetic predisposition . The risk of developing AD is less than one percent before the age of 50 yars old , but increases steeply in each successive decade of life to reach 30 percent by the age of 90 . In patients with familial AD , immediate family relatives have a 50 percent chance of developing AD . One of its first symptoms is severe `` forgetfulness '' caused by short-term memory loss . Dr. Herman Weinreb of the School of Medicine at New York University says `` whether forgetfulness is a serious symptom or not is largely a matter of degree '' and suggests the following criteria : -- Forgetting the name of someone you see infrequently is normal . -- Forgetting the name of a loved one is serious . -- Forgetting where you left your keys is normal . -- Forgetting how to get home is serious . Doctors suggest that people with severe symptoms should be evaluated in order to rule out Alzheimer 's disease and other forms of dementia . -30- -- Canada Remote Systems - Toronto , Ontario 416-629-7000/629-7044

It offers as good an analysis of the meaning of the Second Amendment , especially regarding the militia clause , as I have seen . I have not seen any rebuttles with similar bone fides ... Enjoy . ( Flames to /dev/null ) -- -- -- -- - Begin Enclosed Article -- -- -- -- -- - THE UNABRIDGED SECOND AMENDMENT by J. Neil Schulman If you wanted to know all about the Big Bang , you 'd ring up Carl Sagan , right ? And if you wanted to know about desert warfare , the man to call would be Norman Schwarzkopf , no question about it . But who would you call if you wanted the top expert on American usage , to tell you the meaning of the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution ? That was the question I asked A.C. Brocki , editorial coordinator of the Los Angeles Unified School District and formerly senior editor at Houghton Mifflin Publishers -- who himself had been recommended to me as the foremost expert on English usage in the Los Angeles school system . Mr. Brocki told me to get in touch with Roy Copperud , a retired professor journalism at the University of Southern California and the author of '' American Usage and Style : The Consensus . '' A little research lent support to Brocki 's opinion of Professor Copperud's expertise . Roy Copperud was a newspaper writer on major dailies for over three decades before embarking on a a distinguished 17-year career teaching journalism at USC . Since 1952 , Copperud has been writing a column dealing with the professional aspects of journalism for `` Editor and Publisher '' , a weekly magazine focusing on the journalism field . He 's on the usage panel of the American Heritage Dictionary , and Merriam Webster 's Usage Dictionary frequently cites him as an expert . Copperud's fifth book on usage , `` American Usage and Style : The Consensus , '' has been in continuous print from Van Nostrand Reinhold since 1981 , and is the winner of the Association of American Publisher 's Humanities Award . That sounds like an expert to me . After a brief telephone call to Professor Copperud in which I introduced myself but did not give him any indication of why I was interested , I sent the following letter : '' I am writing you to ask you for your professional opinion as an expert in English usage , to analyze the text of the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution , and extract the intent from the text . `` The text of the Second Amendment is , ' A well-regulated Militia , being necessary for the security of a free State , the right of the people to keep and bear Arms , shall not be infringed . ' `` The debate over this amendment has been whether the first part of the sentence , ' A well-regulated Militia , being necessary to the security of a free State ' , is a restrictive clause or a subordinate clause , with respect to the independent clause containing the subject of the sentence , 'the right of the people to keep and bear Arms , shall not be infringed . ' `` I would request that your analysis of this sentence not take into consideration issues of political impact or public policy , but be restricted entirely to a linguistic analysis of its meaning and intent . Further , since your professional analysis will likely become part of litigation regarding the consequences of the Second Amendment , I ask that whatever analysis you make be a professional opinion that you would be willing to stand behind with your reputation , and even be willing to testify under oath to support , if necessary . '' My letter framed several questions about the test of the Second Amendment , then concluded : '' I realize that I am asking you to take on a major responsibility and task with this letter . I am doing so because , as a citizen , I believe it is vitally important to extract the actual meaning of the Second Amendment . While I ask that your analysis not be affected by the political importance of its results , I ask that you do this because of that importance . '' After several more letters and phone calls , in which we discussed terms for his doing such an analysis , but in which we never discussed either of our opinions regarding the Second Amendment , gun control , or any other political subject , Professor Copperud sent me the follow analysis ( into which I have inserted my questions for the sake of clarity ) : [ Copperud : ] `` The words ' A well-regulated militia , being necessary to the security of a free state , ' contrary to the interpretation cited in your letter of July 26 , 1991 , constitutes a present participle , rather than a clause . It is used as an adjective , modifying 'militia , ' which is followed by the main clause of the sentence ( subject 'the right ' , verb 'shall ' ) . The to keep and bear arms is asserted as an essential for maintaining a militia . `` In reply to your numbered questions : [ Schulman : ] `` ( 1 ) Can the sentence be interpreted to grant the right to keep and bear arms solely to ' a well-regulated militia ' ? '' [ Copperud : ] `` ( 1 ) The sentence does not restrict the right to keep and bear arms , nor does it state or imply possession of the right elsewhere or by others than the people ; it simply makes a positive statement with respect to a right of the people . '' [ Schulman : ] `` ( 2 ) Is 'the right of the people to keep and bear arms ' granted by the words of the Second Amendment , or does the Second Amendment assume a preexisting right of the people to keep and bear arms , and merely state that such right 'shall not be infringed ' ? '' [ Copperud : ] `` ( 2 ) The right is not granted by the amendment ; its existence is assumed . The thrust of the sentence is that the right shall be preserved inviolate for the sake of ensuring a militia . '' [ Schulman : ] `` ( 3 ) Is the right of the people to keep and bear arms conditioned upon whether or not a well regulated militia , is , in fact necessary to the security of a free State , and if that condition is not existing , is the statement 'the right of the people to keep and bear Arms , shall not be infringed ' null and void ? '' [ Copperud : ] `` ( 3 ) No such condition is expressed or implied . The right to keep and bear arms is not said by the amendment to depend on the existence of a militia . No condition is stated or implied as to the relation of the right to keep and bear arms and to the necessity of a well-regulated militia as a requisite to the security of a free state . The right to keep and bear arms is deemed unconditional by the entire sentence . '' [ Schulman : ] `` ( 4 ) Does the clause ' A well-regulated Militia , being necessary to the security of a free State , ' grant a right to the government to place conditions on the 'right of the people to keep and bear arms , ' or is such right deemed unconditional by the meaning of the entire sentence ? '' [ Copperud : ] `` ( 4 ) The right is assumed to exist and to be unconditional , as previously stated . It is invoked here specifically for the sake of the militia . '' [ Schulman : ] `` ( 5 ) Which of the following does the phrase 'well-regulated militia ' mean : 'well-equipped ' , 'well-organized , ' 'well-drilled , ' 'well-educated , ' or 'subject to regulations of a superior authority ' ? '' [ Copperud : ] `` ( 5 ) The phrase means 'subject to regulations of a superior authority ; ' this accords with the desire of the writers for civilian control over the military . '' [ Schulman : ] `` ( 6 ) ( If at all possible , I would ask you to take account the changed meanings of words , or usage , since that sentence was written 200 years ago , but not take into account historical interpretations of the intents of the authors , unless those issues can be clearly separated . '' [ Copperud : ] `` To the best of my knowledge , there has been no change in the meaning of words or in usage that would affect the meaning of the amendment . If it were written today , it might be put : `` Since a well-regulated militia is necessary tot he security of a free state , the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be abridged . ' [ Schulman : ] `` As a 'scientific control ' on this analysis , I would also appreciate it if you could compare your analysis of the text of the Second Amendment to the following sentence , '' A well-schooled electorate , being necessary to the security of a free State , the right of the people to keep and read Books , shall not be infringed . ' `` My questions for the usage analysis of this sentence would be , '' ( 1 ) Is the grammatical structure and usage of this sentence and the way the words modify each other , identical to the Second Amendment 's sentence ? ; and '' ( 2 ) Could this sentence be interpreted to restrict 'the right of the people to keep and read Books ' _only_ to ' a well-educated electorate ' -- for example , registered voters with a high-school diploma ? '' [ Copperud : ] `` ( 1 ) Your 'scientific control ' sentence precisely parallels the amendment in grammatical structure . `` ( 2 ) There is nothing in your sentence that either indicates or implies the possibility of a restricted interpretation . '' Professor Copperud had only one additional comment , which he placed in his cover letter : `` With well-known human curiosity , I made some speculative efforts to decide how the material might be used , but was unable to reach any conclusion . '' So now we have been told by one of the top experts on American usage what many knew all along : the Constitution of the United States unconditionally protects the people 's right to keep and bear arms , forbidding all governments formed under the Constitution from abridging that right . As I write this , the attempted coup against constitutional government in the Soviet Union has failed , apparently because the will of the people in that part of the world to be free from capricious tyranny is stronger than the old guard 's desire to maintain a monopoly on dictatorial power . And here in the United States , elected lawmakers , judges , and appointed officials who are pledged to defend the Constitution of the United States ignore , marginalize , or prevaricate about the Second Amendment routinely . American citizens are put in American prisons for carrying arms , owning arms of forbidden sorts , or failing to satisfy bureaucratic requirements regarding the owning and carrying of firearms -- all of which is an abridgement of the unconditional right of the people to keep and bear arms , guaranteed by the Constitution . And even the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) , staunch defender of the rest of the Bill of Rights , stands by and does nothing . it seems it is up to those who believe in the right to keep and bear arms to preserve that right . no one else will . No one else can . Will we beg our elected representatives not to take away our rights , and continue regarding them as representing us if they do ?

WinHelp ( hwnd , c : \amipro ) for example ) then WinHelp does not search your path and instead looks only to that directory where you have installed your software .

To borrow Money [ ... ] 3 . To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations , [ interstate and Indian tribes ] 4 . To [ do uniform Naturalization and Bankruptcies ] 5 . To coin Money , regulate the Value thereof , and [ etc . ] 6 . To [ punish counterfeiters ] 7 . To establish Post Offices and post Roads 8 . To [ provide patents and copyrights ] 9 . To constitute Tribunals inferior to the Supreme Court ; 10 . To define and punish Piracies and [ etc . ] 11 . To declare War , [ and etc . ] 12 . To raise and support Armies , [ but for no longer than two years at a stretch ] 13 . To provide and maintain a Navy , [ notice no time limit on this one ] 14 . To [ make the rules for the army and navy ] 15 . To provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws [ etc . ] 16 . To provide for [ training of the army except for some state stuff ] 17 . To exercise exclusive Legislation [ in D.C ] 18 . To make all Laws [ necessary to execute the foregoing `` Powers '' ] . Your original instinct was right .

From : armstrng @ cs.dal.ca ( Stan Armstrong ) Subject : Sleeping with one 's aunt Organization : Math , Stats & CS , Dalhousie University , Halifax , NS , Canada Lines : 37 The last time we discussed homosexuality , I asked whether anyone could identify any other act besides homosexual intercourse that the Bible prohibited , but which might in some circumstances bring no apparent harm to anyone . Put another way , the question is whether homosexual intercourse is the only act that Christians are supposed to believe is immoral solely on the basis that God says it is , with no insight being offered as to *why* it is immoral . No one could answer my question in either form from the Bible . ( I did get an interesting response based on Roman Catholic theology ) . However , I think now that I can at least answer my first question . Link Hudson pointed me to it in his recent comments about sleeping with one 's aunt . Incest is held to be immoral in every society , that is , there are some degrees of relationship where marriage ( and thus , intercouse ) is prohibited . The Bible is no exception . The trouble is that it may be difficult to see *why* a particular relationship qualifies as incestuous . Societies differ as to how they define incest . Genetic reasons are sometimes offered , but all the Biblical cases can not be dealt with that way . Why can't a man sleep with his step mother -- assuming that his father is dead and that he has `` married '' her ? How does this case differ from the *duty* to marry one 's brother 's childless wife . Are these two cases parallel ? Does the Bible prohibit some incestuous marriages and homosexual marriages for the same reason , perhaps that God knows they are not good for us and yet we are incapable of understanding why . P.S . Please do n't bother writing me to tell me that I am a homophobe , as some did last time . My mind is not made up on these questions . You do n't know whether I am homophobic or not . You don't know me . To call me or anyone else a homophobe without knowing the person may be as much an expression of bigotry as some homophobic remarks . -- Stan Armstrong .

From : cathy @ LANCE.ColoState.Edu ( Cathy Smith ) Subject : NO SURRENDER -- Lenda Jackson Nntp-Posting-Host : blanca.lance.colostate.edu Organization : Colorado State University , Fort Collins , CO 80523 Lines : 106 NO SURRENDER ! Delivered by Lenda Jackson at the RKBA Rally in Denver , April 18 , 1993 It is a fact of modern life that urban residents , particularly women , feel threatened . A certain number of them actually are threatened . There are immediate threats , the things that women will tell you they 're afraid of . The noise downstairs at night . The lonely walk to the car . The stranger at the door . The abusive husband , finally kicked out of the house as he threatens to hurt her and their children . The burglar ... The mugger ... the rapist . And what are we told is the solution ? Move . Get a dog . Keep the door locked . Call the police . as a next-to-last resort , learn martial arts . and always , there 's the implied question `` what 's a pretty little thing like you doing without a husband around to protect you ? But what if you do n't like dogs ? Like living alone ? Do n't have 10 years to devote learning judo ? What if , after examining the facts , a woman learns that `` rape victims using armed resistance were less likely to have the rape completed - and were less likely to be injured ( Kleck,124 ) than those using any other form of resistance ( Kleck,126 ) ( also true for robbery/assault ) ( Kleck,123 ) What if , to our horror and despair , we find that citizens can not depend on the police for effective protection - they usually respond after a crime has been committed . In truth , the Supreme Court has held that the police are not responsible for protecting any individual , only the whole community . As a society , are we going to ask women , once again , to sacrifice themselves ? Are we going to continue to deny women the ability to help themselves ? Here 's a thought . Neil Smith , in his book The Probability Broach , says '' no 220 pound thug can threaten the well being or dignity of a 110- pound woman who has two pounds of iron to even things out . '' But if a woman decides to protect herself , with the easiest , most efficient means possible , people - especially other women - are horrified . `` Eughh , how could you ? I 'd be terrified ! '' they ask . How could you hurt someone ? They 'll repeat the lie : it 'll just get taken away from you . In truth , 1 % of `` defensive gun uses '' result in the offender taking the gun away from the victim . ( 122 , Kleck ) Well , despite the lies , and the social pressure , some of us have already made that hard choice . We 've decided that we are not going to be victimized by the muggers , burglars or rapists . We 're buying more guns than every before . We 're learning how to use them - and teaching others , women and men , how to use them . Most importantly , we are preparing ourselves mentally to use our firearms for our own defense . We 're taking our own security , literally , into our own hands . We're going to stop begging and pleading and marching and WHAT WE INTEND IS TO REALLY TAKE BACK THE NIGHT . But there 's another threat , more insatiable than any mugger , more secretive than any burglar , more soul-destroying than any rapist . That menace is government , and it threatens us all . We know that governments , throughout time , have suppressed rights and oppressed people . It 's the way they survive . In our names and with our money , it interferes with innocent people both at home and abroad . It lies to us , cheats us , steals from us and threatens us with violence . No one knows exactly what it 'll do next - what freedom we will lose because some government goon decides '' it 's for your own safety '' or `` we know best '' . Any person who acted like government does would be psychoanalyzed within an inch of his life and locked up as a habitual offender . But this monster called government persists , and grows . And we , who should be its masters , have become its unwilling slaves . Do you doubt me ? Then why did you file your income tax ? Like any reasonable person , I believe that being afraid of something that can hurt you is smart , and that paranoia is n't crazy if someone's really after you . And make no mistake , they 're after you and they're after me . Their names are familiar : Brady and Reynolds , Groff , Metzenbahm , Moynihan , and Clinton . If we 're lucky , they 'll settle for our assault rifles , our shotguns , our handguns and our ammunition . As citizens , we have only two choices . They are the same two choices given to women : to surrender or to fight . Surrender leads to the gulag , to the genocide of Pol Pot , to the disappearances , to Dachau . I do not intend to surrender . A battle can be philosophical or political : in the main , the people keep the government honest by threatening to vote it out of office . But if they have to , they will keep in mind the words of Thomas Jefferson : '' the tree of liberty must be well watered with the blood of patriots . '' As a patriot , I will point out the error in the government 's ways . I will do my best to vote the villains out of office . I will protest , and write , and speak , and teach our children justice , honor and truth . And always remember that Rebellion can lead to Bunker Hill and Saratoga ... ... or it can lead to Tiananmen Square . When the time comes to stand up , if I have to give my life to keep them from going too far , if there is a Tiananmen Square in our future , I intend to be there . And no matter what lies they tell and no matter what laws they pass , I intend to meet them with something more substantial in my hand than a brick . My opinions are , of course , my own .

There is widespread folklore , but no good documentary evidence , or even solid rumor , concerning the deaths of the Apostles . Further , the usual context of such arguments , as you observe , is `` No Martyrs for a Lie '' : i.e . the willingness of these people to die rather than recant is evidence for the truth of their belief . This adds the quite stronger twist that the proposed martyrs must have been offered the chance of life by recanting . Since we do n't even know how or where they died , we certainly do n't have this information . ( By the way , even in the case of Stephen it is not at all clear that he could have saved himself by recanting ) . The willingness of true believers to die for their belief , be it in Jesus or Jim Jones , is well-documented , so martyrdom in and of itself says little . [ See 1Kings18:20-40 for a Biblical account of the martyrdom of 450 priests of Baal ] . -- Jim Perry perry @ dsinc.com Decision Support , Inc. , Matthews NC These are my opinions .

I do not believe that this is > yet a standard part of medical practice . Nor is it mine . What I tried to explain to Marty was that it is clearly understood that antibiotic exposure is a risk factor for fungal infections - which is not the same as saying bacteria prevent fungal infections . Marty made this sound like a secret known only to veternarians and biochemists . Anyone who has treated a urinary tract infection knowns this . At some centers pre-op liver transplant patients receive bowel decontamination directed at retaining `` good '' anaerobic flora in an attempt to prevent fungal colonization in this soon-to-be high risk group . I also use lactobacillus to treat enteral nutrition associated diarrhea ( that may be in part due to alterations in gut flora ) . However , it is NOT part of my routine practice to `` reinnoculate '' patients with `` good '' bacteria after antibiotics . I have seen no data on this practice preventing or treating fungal infections in at risk patients . Whether or not it is a `` logical extension '' from the available observations I 'll leave to those of you who base strong opinions and argue over such speculations in the absence of clinical trials . One place such therapy has been described is in treating particularly recalcitrant cases of C. difficile colitis ( NOT a fungal infection ) . There are case reports of using stool ( ie someone elses ) enemas to repopulate the patients flora . Do n't try this at home . > not give give her advise to use the OTC anti-fungal creams .

Seems like this is an excellent argument for ignoring anecdotal conventional wisdom ( a euphemism for no data ) and doing a good clinical trial , like : AU Dismukes-W-E. Wade-J-S. Lee-J-Y . Dockery-B-K. Hain-J-D. TI A randomized , double-blind trial of nystatin therapy for the candidiasis hypersensitivity syndrome [ see comments ] SO N-Engl-J-Med . 1990 Dec 20 . 323 ( 25 ) . P 1717-23. psychological tests . RESULTS . The three active-treatment regimens and the all-placebo regimen significantly reduced both vaginal and systemic symptoms ( P less than 0.001 ) , but nystatin did not reduce the systemic symptoms significantly more than placebo . [ . . . ] CONCLUSIONS . In women with presumed candidiasis hypersensitivity syndrome , nystatin does not reduce systemic or psychological symptoms significantly more than placebo . Consequently , the empirical recommendation of long-term nystatin therapy for such women appears to be unwarranted . Does this trial address every issue raised here , no .

Marty , you 've also changed the terrain of the discussion from empiric itraconazole for undocumented chronic fungal sinusitis with systemic hypersensitivity symptoms ( Noring syndrome ) to the yoghurt and vitamin therapy of undocumented candida enteritis ( Elaine Palmer syndrome ) with systemic symptoms . There is significant difference between the cost and risk of these two empiric therapeutic trials . Are we talking about `` real '' candida infections , the whole `` yeast connection '' hypothesis , the efficacy of routine bacterial repopulation in humans , or the ability of anecdotally effective therapies ( challenged by a negative randomized trial ) to confirm an etiologic hypothesis ( post hoc ergo propter hoc ) . We ca n't seem to focus in on a disease , a therapy , or a hypothesis under discussion . I 'm lost !

'' Speaking > of which , is anyone aware of whether that question *has* been asked of > any knowledgeable or official spokesperson for the government ? I have > not yet seen it mentioned in any of a dozen places it might have been > reported , but I could have easily missed it . Please let us know if you get a solid answer to the question of legality of other strong cryptosystems . So far any references I have seen have been weasel-words ( `` more plans in the future , etc '' ) , but nothing that could be taken as a `` NO ( strong crypto will NOT be outlawed ) '' . I have heard ( not verified ) that the Crime Bill before Congress has language that either requires escrow of keys , or that will regard all systems 'unapproved ' for public use , like strong cryptosystems not trivially broken by the Govt , or without escrowed keys which one can not readily change ( read : use being only permitted by folks with 'special ' connections , or government agencies ) as either 'terrorist tools ' or 'drug dealers tools ' . Not outlawed SPECIFICALLY but by added Civil Forfeiture powers , and clever wording , EFFECTIVELY outlawed for all intents and purposes . Now , for some idle speculation ... for those who do n't care , hit ' n ' now . Crypto being EFFECTIVELY outlawed could be done without SPECIFICALLY outlawing ANY class of crypto systems . For example , a crowbar , hammers , screwdrivers , and such can be regarded as 'burglar tools ' pretty much at the whim of the authorities , based primarily on the individual possessing them in the car , etc . not being in a trade that makes routine use of these tools . In a like manner , one who has no 'legitimate need' ( gov't definition ) for strong crypto software or systems , and is caught using them , might find themselves in possession of 'terrorist tools ' . In other words , if one is not working for a corporation with extremely sensitive commercial data that warrants ( in the Fed 's opinion ) strong security , or a government agency , and securing only work-related data , not personal data , one will most likely be nailed on this if discoverd . A personal desire for 'privacy ' most certainly will not be regarded as a 'legitimate NEED ' : '' Why do you want such strong security , especially from 'legitimate law enforcement ' ? An individual with 'legitimate ' endeavors would not be so concerned - government is not in the business of revealing your personal secrets to the public ... so you must be trying to conceal or planning to conceal some unlawful or criminal activity ... DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO HIDE , HMMMM ? '' I expect that initially there will be some people selected either at random , or who happen to have been 'troublemakers ' for the purposes of 'making an example ' for those who think the Feds are not SERIOUS about this ... ( mega ' : - ( 's ) One asking about a 'right ' to privacy will probably get a response that there is no constitutional right for privacy spelled out AS SUCH ( an argument used in the abortion debate ) : `` You do NOT have a right to have security that 'Legitimate Law Enforcement can not break ' '' ( as suggested in the Clipper Press Release ) . This , in a nutshell , is what I find so extremely frightening . Not only for crypto systems , as in this case , but for the precident it will set , laying the groundwork for future erosions of privacy ( escrow of both safe-deposit box keys - 'master ' keys or combinations for privately owned safes , and so on . WHY NOT ? ) ... I can not think of a better way to make an 'end-run ' around those 'inconvenient ' parts of the US Constitution . A law can not be easily declared unconstitutional , if it there IS NO SPECIFIC LAW . It would simply be a minor extension of the RICO statutes or WoD policies . A simple policy decision , just like so many of the gun regulations are mainly BATF policy decisions ... The Conversation of the Fed agents would go something like : '' We are gon na seize your home , your computers , your car , your bank account , ( you do n't have to undress and give us yer clothes , unless you have a floppy in yer pocket ) because they are all connected with your acquisition , transport , and use of 'terrorist tools ' and/or 'drug dealers tools ' - part of the WoD or against terrorism , ya unnerstand ... no decent American Subject would be against these noble causes ... '' . `` Note we are not accusing YOU of any wrong-doing ... we are only saying your HOME , COMPUTERS , CAR , BANK ASSETS are connected with wrong-doing SOMEHOW - they housed , transported , and funded these 'terrorist tools ' . Only a civil matter ... < heh-heh > ... We had this 'tip ' ... < grin > '' . `` Therefore , the Constitutional Protection on Individual rights do NOT apply - we are 'arresting ' the tainted PROPERTY ... not YOU ... < evil grin > '' . `` If you wish to deposit a BOND , hire some attorneys , and go to court to PROVE the innocence of this property ( that they are not 'terrorist tools' and again to prove they are not also 'drug dealers tools ' ) , go ahead , we have no problem with that ! 'Course , with your bank assets seized , no car , computer , or home , ( probably no job , too ) and your less-than-limitless resources , you might run into some minor practical difficulties < grin > ... '' . THAT is what has me going so damned ballistic ... It is EXACTLY how the logic goes when someone gives a 'tip ' that your home has been used to store DRUGS ... Note no trace of drugs need to be found on the property ... only some bozo who will say 'yup . I stored stuff in that dude 's house ... ' ( probably to get out of a 10 year sentence for dealing ) . Much more cost effective to let him walk , to bust another day , and hit the jackpot with YOUR assets ... Ob Disclaimer ( of course ) ... Ok , note that I am not a lawyer , and can only base these speculations on what I have read/heard/been told regarding past Civil Forfeiture cases , and how they are used to augment the budgets of assorted agencies , or to get 'cooperation ' of folks who just want to be left alone , or who do not wish to be put in a risky situation ( especially in areas where they are denied either meaningful police protection , AND the means to be able to even pretend to defend themselves , as is quite common back East , like NJ , MA , NYC , Wa DC , or out West in CA ) . These people have the choice of cowering under the government boot , or cowering under threats of pissed off drug dealing gang-bangers ... helpless in either case ... All behind some dude who drops a dime on you for his gain , or behind the Feds wanting to 'make an example ' ... Civil Forfeiture being the 'hook ' . Point is , are these speculations way out of line , or are they all too typical , and if so , does the extension to crypto and just about anything that the Feds regard as 'inconvenient ' seem reasonable ?

From : steph @ pegasus.cs.uiuc.edu ( Dale Stephenson ) Subject : Hits Stolen -- Centerfield 1992 Summary : DCON and DOPS for leftfielders Keywords : defense center Organization : University of Illinois , Dept . of Comp . Sci. , Urbana , IL Lines : 118 Disclaimer -- This is for fun . In my computerized baseball game , I keep track of a category called '' stolen hits '' , defined as a play made that `` an average fielder would not make with average effort . '' Using the 1992 Defensive Averages posted by Sherri Nichols ( Thanks Sherri ! ) , I 've figured out some defensive stats for the centerfielders . Hits Stolen have been redefined as `` Plays Juan Gonzalez would not have made . '' OK , I realize that 's unfair . Juan 's probably the victim of pitching staff , fluke shots , and a monster park factor . But let 's put it this way : If we replaced every centerfielder in the league with someone with Kevin 's 55.4 % out making ability , how many extra hits would go by ? To try and correlate it to reality a little more , I 've calculated Net Hits Stolen , based on the number of outs made compared to what a league average fielder would make . By the same method I 've calculated Net Extra Bases ( doubles and triples let by ) . Finally , I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution , or DCON : - > . Basically , it represents the defensive contribution of a player . I add this number to OPS to get DOPS ( Defense + Onbase Plus Slug ) , which should represent the player 's total contribution to the team . So don't take it too seriously . The formula for DCON appears at the end of this article .

If this has already actually been posted , please fill free to flush this copy . -- N ] From : db7n+ @ andrew.cmu.edu ( D. Andrew Byler ) > Does anyone now where an English translation of the long recension of > the Acts of the Apostles can be found ? 1 ] A english translation of this can be found in : `` The Acts of the Apostles , translated from the Codex Bezae , with an introduction on its Lucan Origin and Importance '' , J. M. Wilson ( London , 1923 ) . 2 ] Another work that might be useful is : `` The Acts of the Apostles , a Critical Edition with Introduction and Notes on Selected Passages '' , Albert C. Clark ( Oxford , 1933 ; reprinted 1970 ) . ( This is an edition of text of Acts that makes the assumption that the text in Codex Bezae is the more authentic . I do n't know if it actually contains an english translation or not . ) 3 ] Another useful that discusses many of the variants in detail is : `` The Theological Tendency of the Codex Bezae Cantabrigiensis in Acts '' , Eldon J Epp ( Cambridge , 1966 ) . 4 ] The most recent reference I found was an edition in French from the early '80s . ( I can supply the reference if anyone 's interested . ) 5 ] Now , many of the works are going to be difficult to find . So if you 're interested in examining the differences in the long recension an excellent ( and easily obtainable ) discussion can be found in : `` A Textual Commentary on the Greek NT '' , Bruce Metzger ( United Bible Society , 1971 ) . Metzger 's book serves as a companion volume to the UBS 3rd edition of the Greek NT . It contains a discussion on the reasoning that went behind the decisions on each of the 1440 variant readings included in the UBS3 . Furthermore , notes on an addition 600 readings are included in aTCotGNT ( the majority of these occur in Acts ) . In particular in the introduction to the section on Acts Metzger writes : `` [ An attempt was made ] to set before the reader a more or less full report ( with an English translation ) of the several additions and other modifications that are attested by Western witnesses ... Since many of these have no corresponding apparatus in the text-volume , care was taken to supply an adequate conspectus of the evidence that supports the divergent readings . '' ( p 272 ) . > I understand that one of the early codexes , Vaticanus and Siniaticus has > this version of Acts . It would be interesting to know what the > differences are between the long and the short forms . 6 ] Most of the copies of the text of Acts that we have ( including the ones in Vaticanus and Siniaticus ) adher pretty closely to the shorter ( or Alexandrian ) version . The longer version to which you refer is usually called the `` Western '' version and its main witness is the Codex Bezae ( althought there are a few other rather fragmentary sources ) . 7 ] As far as size , the difference is that in Clark 's edition ( mentioned above ) the book of Acts contains 19,983 words whereas the text edited by Westcott and Hort ( a typical Alexandrian text ) contains 18,401 words ; i.e . a difference of about 8-1/2 % . 8 ] To answer the obvious questions , no , there are no major revelations in the longer text nor major omissions in the shorter text . The main difference seems to `` expansion '' of detail in the Western text ( or , if you prefer `` contractions '' in the Alexandrian ) . The Western text seems to be given to more detail . There are some interesting specific cases , but this probably not the place to go into it in detail . 9 ] The discussion over the years as to which of these versions is the more authentic has been hot and heavy . If there is anything approaching a modern consensus it is ( i ) that neither text represents purely the `` authentic '' version , ( ii ) each variant reading has to be examined on its own merits however , ( iii ) the variant in the Alexandrian text is the `` better '' more often than not .

Is it authoritative ? > > '' Authoritative '' is not a quality of the writing itself- it is a statement > by the community of faith whether it will accept the writing as normative . Arguably , it is both . Since authority is a matter of both communicator and recepiant we can say that , for example `` Jesus is Lord '' whether the world at large accepts the authority or not . Thus the Bible can be considered for its authoritative content whether or not it is accepted ( This issue is at the heart of Pilate 's pragmatic question `` What is truth ? '' to Jesus when our Lord was brought before Him . Jesus ' reply was to appeal to the authority of his Father ) You also might like to consider the claimed authority represented by the statements `` thus says the Lord '' in the Bible , which claim to put across the exact words of God . You fall into the danger of relativism with your rejection of inherant authority and claim that it lies only in the `` community of faith '' - does something become truth because it is accepted ? The main thrust of my argument is that there is a Godward direction as well as a manward ( which is where the reference to Rev 22 came in . ) > : 2 . Is it prophetic ? > > How is `` prophecy '' to be defined ? If it is `` speaking forth '' of God 's message , > much of the apocrypha must surely qualify . If we narrowed it down to the predictive elements - which will cut out some of the 39 accepted OT books as well - we nonetheless have criteria for determining the validity of the book : Jesus ' standards were that `` Scripture can not be broken '' .

Many of the apocryphal books are highly > '' dynamic '' -thought provoking , faithful , even exciting . What this is getting at is the relationship between text and reader . It is to do with the quality of writing , which should have the ability to fire the mind , affect our thought life and cause us to act in a certain way - there is something of this in Jesus ' quote : `` Man does not live by bread alone , but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of the Lord '' .

Of course the apocryphal books were received ( by some ) , > collected ( or else we would not have them ) , read and used ( and they still are , > in the Catholic and Orthodox churches ) . Does the Catholic Church give the same authority to the Apocrapha as to the accepted 66 books ? Certainly it is not as widely used as the OT and NT . > : On these counts , the apocrapha falls short of the glory of God . > > This is demonstrably false . Think about what I have said above . You may want to revise your conclusion . In addition think about other 'sacred writings ' , eg the Koran , the book of Mormon and how and why you would categorise them using the above principles . One word of caution - you may find some 'reflected glory ' in some of these books : in that the 'inspired quality ' may be derived from the Bible .

I 'm not asking anyone here to buy into `` The Yeast Connection '' book > because I do n't know what 's in that book , plain and simple . And to be honest > with you , I 'm beginning to wish that it was never written . I agree with this consensus that it should not have been written the way it was . My doctor - who claims to have introduced Dr. Crook to the possibility of candida overbloom causing diffuse symptoms way back in 1961 ( I have no reason to doubt him on this ) - does not like the book because 1 ) it makes too many unfounded claims , and 2 ) is horribly written from a scientific viewpoint . On the other hand , my doctor has always kept an open mind on the subject and does believe in aspects of the `` yeast connection '' . But , I believe there is some truth to the book . Hopefully the right clinical studies can be done to separate the fact from the fiction . In the meantime , I 'd still encourage people who have `` incurable '' chronic sinus problems ( especially if they overused antibiotics ) , to find a doctor to administer a systemic-type anti-fungal such as itraconazole ( along with liver panels before , during and after treatment just to play it safe ) . It is an empirical approach for sure , but when all else fails , and your ENT says `` sorry , you 'll just have to live with it '' , it is time to step out and try an empirical approach backed up with significant anecdotal evidence ( Dr. Ivker ) , supported by plausible theories ( outlined by Marty ) . At this stage you have little to lose , particularly if you use itraconazole and have the proper monitoring - the health risk has been shown through extensive clinical studies both in Europe and the U.S. to be very minimal with relatively healthy ( i.e. , non-AIDS ) patients . I 'm glad I did this , since I saw remarkable results after only one week on Sporanox ( itraconazole ) . Of course , your mileage may vary a lot - everyone is different so it may not work for you .

I have noticed my and my associates progression from hackers to computer professionals . It is rather distasteful . It occurs when a series of things happen : 1 ) one 's ego outgrows one 's talent/knowledge 2 ) one 's financial situation takes precedence 3 ) A change in priorities ( esp . family ) possibly leading to 2 ) 4 ) the hacker 's attitude makes the shift from `` fun '' to `` work '' 5 ) one 's vocation burns away the creativity needed for `` the hobby '' or the biggest killer ( IMO ) 6 ) one 's dreams are ( sadly ) shattered on the hard rocks of society's version of reality . Without the dream the motivation dies , without the motivation the effort seems useless . Another set of problems stems from our children . While most of us remember when there were several completely different computer systems , our children are growing up with just a few choices ( MSDOS/Mac/Amiga ) and do not enjoy the diversity we did . I remember the great computer fallout of the early eighties vividly as I was forced to stop using skills developed for systems that were now dead . The diversity of systems before then allowed for widely divergent paradigms . That period forced hackers to continually learn new systems in the attempt to keep up . Not to mention that if a program was needed we were forced ( in most situations ) to write it ourselves as a commercial offering was just not available . Now our children are being taught the `` user '' mentality . As the number of us `` old-timers '' dwindle we are not being replaced by the next generation .

If my powerplay was as bad as Montreal 's , I 'd be thanking Stewart for calling as few penalties as possible . Quebec 's powerplay is lethal and it is to their advantage to have a penalty-filled game where they can clean up with their superior powerplay . Montreal really lost that game ( and game 2 ) because Patrick Roy is well on his way to having another one of his trademark awful playoffs . The man is truly overrated . Quebec has scored six goals on Roy and four , perhaps five , were quite stoppable . Alan

A/C is a MUST on any Probe from 89 - 93 . The 93 in particular sends out a REAL BLAST of cool air when the AC is on MAX .

From : squish @ endor.uucp ( Shishin Yamada ) Subject : Re : Laser vs Bubblejet ? Organization : Aiken Computation Lab , Harvard University Lines : 56 Just thought I would add $ 0.02 to DeskJet thread . I got my first one in college about 5 or so years ago . I 've been a happy HP user of the DeskWriter for Macintosh for past 5 years . I got one just a few months after their release . And I got software revision 1.0a ( now I 'm up to rev . 3.1 . Our family ( sister and father ) have each purchased their own DW 's after seeing mine go for one year unscathed ( their stuck to their trusty ImageWriter II 's ) . The original DW has gone for 5 years at moderate personal use . I would say that it has gone through at least 15,000 sheets , and around one ( small ) ink cartridge every 3 months or so . My brother might take this DW now ( I 'm probably gon na give it to him ) , and I am looking to upgrade to a color DW . The chief advantages/disadvantages I 've found over the years are : Advantages : Quick ( 2-3 ppm ) , Quiet ( roomate can sleep while it's printing ) , AppleTalk Networkable ( unfortunately the original was n't , so look out if you buy used . I rewired our home with phonenet AppleTalk connectors , and while home , we can all use my dad 's one DW ! ) , and cheap ( now run ~ $ 300 ) . BTW , you can upgrade older DW 's to color or for appletalk , I dunno if HP still does the upgrades , but I received many offers ( I just did n't ned it however ) . Also , crisp laser-quality output is a wonder ( used to really impress those ImageWriter Dot-Matrix people so much so , that I had to charge $ 0.25 per sheet to stop my college dorm neighbors from bothering me at all hours of the night ... . ) Disadvantages . Ink used to be hard to find , and was n't cheap , and was n't originally water-proof . While HP has done wonders with the ink ( I dunno if it 's still toxic ) , it is still subjet to smearing and running ( if you run around in the damp Boston rain , and get your bookbag completely soaked ) . Ink now runs about $ 14- $ 15 for small carts ( I get mine from Elek-Tek in Chicago , I think they 're now down to $ 12 ) . The ink carts used to say they 're dated for only 6 months , but I do n't think they say so anymore . We stick to a 4 month supply ( of about 3 carts ) . We use cheap Hammerhill Laser Print paper ( after fooling for a long time . Laser/Xerox paper is also good ) . Smearing does n't happen , unless you have a brand new ink cart and you grab the paper and smudge it all over as soon as it comes out of the machine . Other disadvantages are : No Postscript ( this can be an advantage in speed , usually ) . Ways around this are Ghostscript or Freedom of Press software solutions . I bet HP probably has a PS prototype inkjet , but they wo n't release it for fear of hurting LJ sales . In the end , the primary advantages of laser are true postscript ( unless you go for cheap lasers ) , and fused toner ( no smearing , even when soaking in water ) . Lasers are slightly sharper , but the only instance where I needed precise layouts was Printed Circuit Board Transparencies for PhotoEtching . I found a Textronix color Phaser Postscript ( Thermal Wax Transfer ) to work the best to make PCB negatives directly onto a transparency . Well , hope my babbling has helped . -squish @ endor.harvard.edu

Will anybody A typical Armenian revisionist . As in the past in x-Soviet Armenia , and today in Azerbaijan , for utopic and idiotic causes the Armenians brought havoc to their neighbors . A short-sighted and misplaced nationalistic fervor with a wrong agenda and anachronistic methods the Armenians continue to become pernicious for the region . As usual , they will be treated accordingly by their neighbors . Nagorno-Karabag is a mountainous enclave that lies completely within Azerbaijan with no border or history whatsoever connected to x-Soviet Armenia . Besides the geographical aspect , Nagorno-Karabag is the historic homeland and the 'cradle ' of the artistic and literary heritage of Azerbaijan , which renders the Armenian claims preposterous , even lunatic . No one in his or her mind could have imagined that one day such a devious turn of event could have plagued the Azeris . One can not even imagine the reverse case to occur , for the Armenians either would have slaughtered the Azerbaijanis , or put them to forced exile to maintain their own majority . Where was she ? An Appeal to Mankind During the last three years Azerbaijan and its multinational population are vainly fighting for justice within the limits of the Soviet Union . All humanitarian , constitutional human rights guaranteed by the UN Charter , Universal Declaration of Human Rights , Helsinki Agreements , Human Problems International Forums , documents signed by the Soviet Union - all of them are violated . The USSR 's President , government bodies do not defend Azerbaijan though they are all empowered to take necessary measures to guarantee life and peace . The 140,000 strong army of Armenian terrorists with Moscow's tacit consent wages an undeclared war of annihilation against Azerbaijan . As a result , a part of Azerbaijan has been occupied and annexed , hundreds of people killed , thousands wounded . Some 200,000 Azerbaijanis have been brutally and inhumanly deported from the Armenian SSR , their historical homeland . Together with them 64,000 Russians and 22,000 Kurds have also been driven out , a part of them now settled in Azerbaijan . Some 40,000 Turkish-Meskhetians , Lezghins and representatives of other Caucasian nationalities who escaped from the Central Asia where the President and government bodies did not guarantee them the life and peace also suffered from these deportations . One of the scandalous vandalisms directed not only against Azerbaijan science but the world civilization as well is the Armenian extremists ' destruction of the Karabakh scientific experimental base of The Institute of Genetics and Selection of the Academy of Sciences of the Azerbaijan SSR . We beg you for humanitarian help and political assistance , for the honour and dignity of 7 million Azerbaijanis are violated , its territory , culture and history are trampled , its people are shot . There is persistent negative image of Azerbaijanians abroad , and this defamation is spread over the whole world by Soviet mass media , Armenian lobby in the USSR and the United States . One of the myths is that all events allegedly involves and generated by interethnic collisions and religious intolerance while the truth is that all these shootings and recent events stem from the territorial claims of Armenia on Azerbaijan . It is a well documented fact that before the conflict there were no frictions between Armenians and Azerbaijanis on the issue of Karabakh . Hundreds and thousands Armenians placidly and calmly lived and worked in Azerbaijan land , had their representatives in all government bodies of the Azerbaijan SSR . We are for a united , indivisible , sovereign Azerbaijan , we are for a common Caucasian home proclaimed in 1918 by one of the founding fathers of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic - Muhammed Emin Rasulzade . But all these goals and expectations are trampled upon the Soviet leadership in favour of the Armenian expansionists encouraged by Moscow and intended to create a new ' 1,000 Year Reich ' - the 'Great Armenia ' - by annexing the neighboring lands . The world public opinion shed tears to save the whales , suffers for penguins dying out in the Antarctic Continent . But what about the lives of seven million human beings ? If these people are Muslims , does it mean that they are less valuable ? Can people be discriminated by their colour of skin or religion , by their residence or other attributes ? All people are brothers , and we appeal to our brothers for help and understanding . This is not the first appeal of Azerbaijan to the world public opinion . Our previous appeals were unheard . However , we still carry the hope that the truth beyond the Russian and Armenian propaganda will one day reveal the extent of our suffering and stimulate at least as much help and compassion for Azerbaijan as tendered to whales and penguins . THE COMMITTEE FOR PEOPLE 'S HELP TO KARABAKH ( OF THE ) ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE AZERBAIJAN SSR '' PAINFUL SEARCH .. '' THE GRUESOME extent of February 's killings of Azeris by Armenians in the town of Hojali is at last emerging in Azerbaijan - about 600 men , women and children dead in the worst outrage of the four-year war over Nagorny Karabakh . The figure is drawn from Azeri investigators , Hojali officials and casualty lists published in the Baku press . Diplomats and aid workers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates . The 25 February attack on Hojali by Armenian forces was one of the last moves in their four-year campaign to take full control of Nagorny Karabakh , the subject of a new round of negotiations in Rome on Monday . The bloodshed was something between a fighting retreat and a massacre , but investigators say that most of the dead were civilians . The awful number of people killed was first suppressed by the fearful former Communist government in Baku . Later it was blurred by Armenian denials and grief-stricken Azerbaijan 's wild and contradictory allegations of up to 2,000 dead . The State Prosecuter , Aydin Rasulov , the cheif investigator of a 15-man team looking into what Azerbaijan calls the `` Hojali Disaster '' , said his figure of 600 people dead was a minimum on preliminary findings . A similar estimate was given by Elman Memmedov , the mayor of Hojali . An even higher one was printed in the Baku newspaper Ordu in May - 479 dead people named and more than 200 bodies reported unidentified . This figure of nearly 700 dead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova , the new spokeswoman of the Azeri Ministry of Defence . FranCois Zen Ruffinen , head of delegation of the International Red Cross in Baku , said the Muslim imam of the nearby city of Agdam had reported a figure of 580 bodies received at his mosque from Hojali , most of them civilians . `` We did not count the bodies . But the figure seems reasonable . It is no fantasy , '' Mr Zen Ruffinen said . `` We have some idea since we gave the body bags and products to wash the dead . '' Mr Rasulov endeavours to give an unemotional estimate of the number of dead in the massacre . `` Do n't get worked up . It will take several months to get a final figure , '' the 43-year-old lawyer said at his small office . Mr Rasulov knows about these things . It took him two years to reach a firm conclusion that 131 people were killed and 714 wounded when Soviet troops and tanks crushed a nationalist uprising in Baku in January 1990 . Those nationalists , the Popular Front , finally came to power three weeks ago and are applying pressure to find out exactly what happened when Hojali , an Azeri town which lies about 70 miles from the border with Armenia , fell to the Armenians . Officially , 184 people have so far been certified as dead , being the number of people that could be medically examined by the republic 's forensic department . `` This is just a small percentage of the dead , '' said Rafiq Youssifov , the republic 's chief forensic scientist . `` They were the only bodies brought to us . Remember the chaos and the fact that we are Muslims and have to wash and bury our dead within 24 hours . '' Of these 184 people , 51 were women , and 13 were children under 14 years old . Gunshots killed 151 people , shrapnel killed 20 and axes or blunt instruments killed 10 . Exposure in the highland snows killed the last three . Thirty-three people showed signs of deliberate mutilation , including ears , noses , breasts or penises cut off and eyes gouged out , according to Professor Youssifov's report . Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those believed to have been killed , Mr Rasulov said . Files from Mr Rasulov 's investigative commission are still disorganised - lists of 44 Azeri militiamen are dead here , six policemen there , and in handwriting of a mosque attendant , the names of 111 corpses brought to be washed in just one day . The most heartbreaking account from 850 witnesses interviewed so far comes from Towfiq Manafov , an Azeri investigator who took a helicopter flight over the escape route from Hojali on 27 February . `` There were too many bodies of dead and wounded on the ground to count properly : 470-500 in Hojali , 650-700 people by the stream and the road and 85-100 visible around Nakhchivanik village , '' Mr Manafov wrote in a statement countersigned by the helicopter pilot . `` People waved up to us for help . We saw three dead children and one two-year-old alive by one dead woman . The live one was pulling at her arm for the mother to get up . We tried to land but Armenians started a barrage against our helicopter and we had to return . '' There has been no consolidation of the lists and figures in circulation because of the political upheavals of the last few months and the fact that nobody knows exactly who was in Hojali at the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villages taken over by Armenian forces . THE INDEPENDENT , London , 12/6/'92 HEROES WHO FOUGHT ON AMID THE BODIES AREF SADIKOV sat quietly in the shade of a cafe-bar on the Caspian Sea esplanade of Baku and showed a line of stitches in his trousers , torn by an Armenian bullet as he fled the town of Hojali just over three months ago , writes Hugh Pope . `` I 'm still wearing the same clothes , I do n't have any others , '' the 51-year-old carpenter said , beginning his account of the Hojali disaster . `` I was wounded in five places , but I am lucky to be alive . '' Mr Sadikov and his wife were short of food , without electricity for more than a month , and cut off from helicopter flights for 12 days . They sensed the Armenian noose was tightening around the 2,000 to 3,000 people left in the straggling Azeri town on the edge of Karabakh . `` At about 11pm a bombardment started such as we had never heard before , eight or nine kinds of weapons , artillery , heavy machine-guns , the lot , '' Mr Sadikov said . Soon neighbours were pouring down the street from the direction of the attack . Some huddled in shelters but others started fleeing the town , down a hill , through a stream and through the snow into a forest on the other side . To escape , the townspeople had to reach the Azeri town of Agdam about 15 miles away . They thought they were going to make it , until at about dawn they reached a bottleneck between the two Armenian villages of Nakhchivanik and Saderak . `` None of my group was hurt up to then ... Then we were spotted by a car on the road , and the Armenian outposts started opening fire , '' Mr Sadikov said . Azeri militiamen fighting their way out of Hojali rushed forward to force open a corridor for the civilians , but their efforts were mostly in vain . Mr Sadikov said only 10 people from his group of 80 made it through , including his wife and militiaman son . Seven of his immediate relations died , including his 67-year-old elder brother . `` I only had time to reach down and cover his face with his hat , '' he said , pulling his own big flat Turkish cap over his eyes . `` We have never got any of the bodies back . '' The first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire . One hero of the evacuation , Alif Hajief , was shot dead as he struggled to change a magazine while covering the third group's crossing , Mr Sadikov said . Another hero , Elman Memmedov , the mayor of Hojali , said he and several others spent the whole day of 26 February in the bushy hillside , surrounded by dead bodies as they tried to keep three Armenian armoured personnel carriers at bay . As the survivors staggered the last mile into Agdam , there was little comfort in a town from which most of the population was soon to flee . `` The night after we reached the town there was a big Armenian rocket attack . Some people just kept going , '' Mr Sadikov said . `` I had to get to the hospital for treatment . I was in a bad way . They even found a bullet in my sock . '' Victims of war : An Azeri woman mourns her son , killed in the Hojali massacre in February ( left ) . Nurses struggle in primitive conditions ( centre ) to save a wounded man in a makeshift operating theatre set up in a train carriage .

I have a question regarding satellite technology seen in the movie Patriot Games . In the movies , the CIA utilizes its orbitting sats to pinpoint a specific terrorist camp in N Africa . The photos taken by the sats are stunning ! I know that sats are capable of photographing the license plates of vehicles . My question is this : The camp in question was taken out by the British SAS . And while the SAS was in action , the CIA team was watching in the warroom back in Langley , VA . The action of the SAS was clear and appeared to be relayed via a sat . The action was at night and the photography appeared to be an x-ray type .

'' . Following my request , several people were so kind as to suggest reading-lists , which I hope to get around to . Two other people were so *very* kind as to send large documents , which I presume were actual articles ( about 1000 lines each ) ; but I 've stupidly deleted them accidentally before having a chance even to skim them . If they can forgive me for my careless use of file-commands , would the original senders be so kind as to resend ? Or anyone else who has good crypto-articles at a fairly technical mathematical level ? Also , ftp-able or gopher-able docs would be nice to know about .

From : ae446 @ Freenet.carleton.ca ( Nigel Allen ) Subject : Text of President Clinton 's Letter to Congress on Iranian Assets Reply-To : ae446 @ Freenet.carleton.ca ( Nigel Allen ) Organization : The National Capital Freenet , Ottawa Lines : 143 Here is a press release from the White House . Text of President Clinton 's Letter to Congress on Iranian Assets To : National Desk Contact : White House Press Office , 202-456-2100 WASHINGTON , May 14 -- Following is a letter President Clinton wrote to Congress on Iranian Assets : TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES : I hereby report to the Congress on developments since the last Presidential report on November 10 , 1992 , concerning the national emergency with respect to Iran that was declared in Executive Order No . 12170 of November 14 , 1979 , and matters relating to Executive Order No . 12613 of October 29 , 1987 . This report is submitted pursuant to section 204 ( c ) of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act , 50 U.S.C . 1703 ( c ) , and section 505 ( c ) of the International Security and Development Cooperation Act of 1985 , 22 U.S.C . 2349aa-9 ( c ) . This report covers events through March 31 , 1993 . The last report , dated November 10 , 1992 , covered events through October 15 , 1992 . 1 . There have been no amendments to the Iranian Transactions Regulations ( `` ITRs '' ) , 31 CFR Part 560 , or to the Iranian Assets Control Regulations ( `` IACRs '' ) , 31 CFR Part 535 , since the last report . 2 . The Office of Foreign Assets Control ( `` FAC '' ) of the Department of the Treasury continues to process applications for import licenses under the ITRs . However , as previously reported , recent amendments to the ITRs have resulted in a substantial decrease in the number of applications received relating to the importation of nonfungible Iranian-origin goods . During the reporting period , the Customs Service has continued to effect numerous seizures of Iranian-origin merchandise , primarily carpets , for violation of the import prohibitions of the ITRs . FAC and Customs Service investi- gations of these violations have resulted in forfeiture actions and the imposition of civil monetary penalties . Additional forfeiture and civil penalty actions are under review . 3 . The Iran-United States Claims Tribunal ( the `` Tribunal '' ) , established at The Hague pursuant to the Algiers Accords , continues to make progress in arbitrating the claims before it . Since the last report , the Tribunal has rendered 12 awards , for a total of 545 awards . Of that total , 367 have been awards in favor of American claimants : 222 of these were awards on agreed terms , authorizing and approving payment of settlements negotiated by the parties , and 145 were decisions adjudicated on the merits . The Tribunal has issued 36 decisions dismissing claims on the merits and 83 decisions dismissing claims for jurisdictional reasons . Of the 59 remaining awards , 3 approved the withdrawal of cases , and 56 were in favor of Iranian claimants . As of March 31 , 1993 , awards to successful American claimants from the Security Account held by the NV Settlement Bank stood at $ 2,340,072,357.77 . As of March 31 , 1993 , the Security Account has fallen below the required balance of $ 500 million 36 times . Iran has periodically replenished the account , as required by the Algiers Accords , by transferring funds from the separate account held by the NV Settlement Bank in which interest on the Security Account is deposited . Iran has also replenished the account with the proceeds from the sale of Iranian-origin oil imported into the United States , pursuant to transactions licensed on a case-by- case basis by FAC . Iran has not , however , replenished the account since the last oil sale deposit on October 8 , 1992 . The aggregate amount that has been transferred from the Interest Account to the Security Account is $ 874,472,986.47 . As of March 31 , 1993 , the total amount in the Security Account was $ 216,244,986.03 , and the total amount in the Interest Account was $ 8,638,133.15 . 4 . The Tribunal continues to make progress in the arbitration of claims of U.S. nationals for $ 250,000.00 or more . Since the last report , nine large claims have been decided . More than 85 percent of the nonbank claims have now been disposed of through adjudication , settlement , or voluntary withdrawal , leaving 76 such claims on the docket . The larger claims , the resolution of which has been slowed by their complexity , are finally being resolved , sometimes with sizable awards to the U.S. claimants . For example , two claimants were awarded more than $ 130 million each by the Tribunal in October 1992 . 5 . As anticipated by the May 13 , 1990 , agreement settling the claims of U.S. nationals for less than $ 250,000.00 , the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission ( `` FCSC '' ) has continued its review of 3,112 claims . The FCSC has issued decisions in 1,201 claims , for total awards of more than $ 22 million . The FCSC expects to complete its adjudication of the remaining claims in early 1994 . 6 . In coordination with concerned Government agencies , the Department of State continues to present United States Government claims against Iran , as well as responses by the United States Government to claims brought against it by Iran . In November 1992 , the United States filed 25 volumes of supporting information in case B/1 ( Claims 2 & 3 ) , Iran 's claim against the United States for damages relating to its Foreign Military Sales Program . In February of this year , the United States participated in a daylong prehearing conference in several other cases involving military equipment . Iran also filed a new interpretative dispute alleging that the failure of U.S. courts to enforce an award against a U.S. corporation violated the Algiers Accords . 7 . As reported in November , Jose Maria Ruda , President of the Tribunal , tendered his resignation on October 2 , 1992 . No successor has yet been named . Judge Ruda 's resignation will take effect as soon as a successor becomes available to take up his duties . 8 . The situation reviewed above continues to involve important diplomatic , financial , and legal interests of the United States and its nationals . Iran 's policy behavior presents challenges to the national security and foreign policy of the United States . The IACRs issued pursuant to Executive Order No . 12170 continue to play an important role in structuring our relationship with Iran and in enabling the United States to implement properly the Algiers Accords . Similarly , the ITRs issued pursuant to Executive Order No . 12613 continue to advance important objectives in combatting inter- national terrorism . I shall exercise the powers at my disposal to deal with these problems and will report periodically to the Congress on significant developments . WILLIAM J.

From : C445585 @ mizzou1.missouri.edu ( John Kelsey ) Subject : One-time pad authentication ? Nntp-Posting-Host : mizzou1.missouri.edu Organization : University of Missouri Lines : 51 I can think of a couple of ways of guaranteeing authenticity in a one-time pad encrytped scheme , though I 'm not sure how to prove that what kind of authenicity they provide . An obvious first-attempt might be to prepend a truly random ( unpredictable for Eve ) block to the message , and then calculate a CRC which included the random starting block and all of the message . This could be encrypted after the message . The problem is , I 'm not sure it 's impossible to come up with a message that will hash to the same CRC regardless of the random starting block . ( It intuitively seems like it ought to be hard , but I 'm not *that* sure ... . ) Clearly , a crypto-strength hash like MD5 or the SHA would be stronger , but again , I 'm not sure I 'm comfortable claiming that it's unbreakable . A scheme to use up some of the pad bits to decide how many bits of 0's to include in the plaintext stream before going on would n't be too bad , either . At the cost of increasing the speed with which you use up your pad , this could be used to give you arbitrarily low probability that your opponent could spoof a valid-looking message , since any deciphered plaintext in a spot that should be carrying 0 's will show that something funny 's going on . If , for each message bit M_i , we used up one random bit , R_i , to decide whether to insert a 0 into the plaintext stream , we 'd get a total pad use of 2.5 times the message length . ( We 'd expand the message size by about half . ) Each 0 that should appear in the plaintext stream that does n't is a guess for our would-be spoofer . At each bit , she has to guess . I 'm trying to see how to quantify her chances of making it all the way through the spoofed message , but it gets a little complicated , because she can get un- synched , and still happen to have a 0 in that place in the spoofed message . Now , I can see a simple way of doing this that 's got to be as secure as a one-time pad , at a cost of using 4 times the message length in pad bits . For each message bit , M_i , use one random bit , R_i , and xor them together to get X_i . Now , encrypt the three bits with the one-time pad . The enemy has no way of guessing what R_i is , so he/she ca n't guess what X_i is , either . Any change she makes in the ciphertext stream will have to involve a guess of what R_i was . Is there any way to do this without using so many pad bits ? Spoofing the message is equivalent to correctly guessing as many random bits as there are bits in the message . Clearly , this makes spoofing messages just as hard if you know the whole message text as if you know none of it . In fact , it looks to me like this makes it just as hard to generate a spoofed message with the ciphertext as without it , but I 'm not entirely sure about that . Is there an easier way of doing this that 's provably as secure as the one-time pad ? -- John Kelsey

This is the liquid type of wax in bottles that you pour it in water , sponge it on you car , hose it off , and dry it with cloth . Many people have used it . It is very easy to work with and gives seeminly the same visual results as that of paste type of wax . But , does it last long ? Does it have any negative effects to car paint ? Can you forward your reply directly to my email id ? Thanks . James

When I asked , people said that the > interpolation was not simply linear interpolation , but significantly more > complicated . You are quite correct in your understanding . The filtering is not interpolation , as that would distort the frequency content of the signal you are listening to . Generally , these players run the samples thru an all-pass filter network . I have done this for ECG waveforms from a person's heart , and the effect is rather spooky . It actually reconstructs peaks that were n't there ( correctly , too ! ) and fills in the gaps with the properly computed values , just as if there had been a real sample taken at that point . I use a CPU to do all the math . It takes a decent ( but not unreasonable ) amount of CPU time to do this . You can keep up with things in realtime if you write efficient code . In case you care , the filtering method uses an FIR ( finite impulse response ) filter . I 'd guess that CD makers use the same kind of method . Anybody out there know the real answer ? I 'd say that they use a tapped delay line with resistor/op-amp weighting to accomplish the filtering . This strikes me as the most cost effective method for volume production runs . > Anyway , then , the purpose of oversampling is to move the `` effective '' > sampling rate up to n times 44.1 KHz , in order to use higher frequency > antialiasing filters .

Actually , I think the only reason they do this is so that they can say that they have a marketting gimic . I would guess that it is acutally cheaper to filter an oversampled signal than not . You can use sloppier components and give the filter a roll-off that is n't so sharp . It 's too bad that they charge more for something that ( I think ) is actually less costly to build . I seriously doubt that the filters cost the same but are better . They are built to a price spec , and that spec says `` cheap as possible !

Well , they ca n't listen in on much of mine , since I already use cryptography for much of my electronic mail , and will start using it for my telephony as soon as practical . However , allow me to tell a parable . There was once a far away land called Ruritania , and in Ruritania there was a strange phenonmenon -- all the trees that grew in Ruritainia were transparent . Now , in the days when people had lived in mud huts , this had not been a problem , but now high-tech wood technology had been developed , and in the new age of wood , everyone in Ruritania found that their homes were all 100 % see through . Now , until this point , no one ever thought of allowing the police to spy on someone 's home , but the new technology made this tempting . This being a civilized country , however , warrants were required to use binoculars and watch someone in their home . The police , taking advantage of this , would get warrants to use binoculars and peer in to see what was going on . Occassionally , they would use binoculars without a warrant , but everyone pretended that this did n't happen . One day , a smart man invented paint -- and if you painted your house , suddenly the police could n't watch all your actions at will . Things would go back to the way they were in the old age -- completely private . Indignant , the state decided to try to require that all homes have video cameras installed in every nook and cranny . `` After all '' , they said , `` with this new development crime could run rampant . Installing video cameras does n't mean that the police get any new capability -- they are just keeping the old one . '' A wise man pointed out that citizens were not obligated to make the lives of the police easy , that the police had survived all through the mud hut age without being able to watch the citizens at will , and that Ruritania was a civilized country where not everything that was expedient was permitted . For instance , in a neighboring country , it had been discovered that torture was an extremely effective way to solve crimes . Ruritania had banned this practice in spite of its expedience . Indeed , `` why have warrants at all '' , he asked , `` if we are interested only in expedience ? '' A famous paint technologist , Dorothy Quisling , intervened however . She noted that people might take photographs of children masturbating should the new paint technology be widely deployed without safeguards , and the law was passed . Soon it was discovered that some citizens would cover their mouths while speaking to each other , thus preventing the police from reading their lips through the video cameras . This had to be prevented , the police said . After all , it was preventing them from conducting their lawful surveilance . The wise man pointed out that the police had never before been allowed to listen in on people 's homes , but Dorothy Quisling pointed out that people might use this new invention of covering their mouths with veils to discuss the kidnapping and mutilation of children . No one in the legislature wanted to be accused of being in favor of mutilating children , but then again , no one wanted to interfere in people 's rights to wear what they liked , so a compromise was reached whereby all homes were installed with microphones in each room to accompany the video cameras . The wise man lamented few if any child mutilations had ever been solved by the old lip reading technology , but it was too late -- the microphones were installed everwhere . However , it was discovered that this was insufficient to prevent citizens from hiding information from the authorities , because some of them would cleverly speak in languages that the police could not understand . A new law was proposed to force all citizens to speak at all times only in Ruritanian , and , for good measure , to require that they speak clearly and distinctly near the microphones . `` After all '' , Dorothy Quisling pointed out , `` they might be using the opportunity to speak in private to mask terrorist activities ! '' Terrorism struck terror into everyone 's hearts , and they rejoiced at the brulliance of this new law . Meanwhile , the wise man talked one evening to his friends on how all of this was making a sham of the constitution of Ruritania , of which all Ruritanians were proud . `` Why '' , he asked , `` are we obligated to sacrifice all our freedom and privacy to make the lives of the police easier ? There is n't any real evidence that this makes any big dent in crime anyway ! All it does is make our privacy forfeit to the state ! '' However , the wise man made the mistake of saying this , as the law required , in Ruritanian , clearly and distinctly , and near a microphone . Soon , the newly formed Ruritanian Secret Police arrived and took him off , and got him to confess by torturing him . Torture was , after all , far more efficient than the old methods , and had been recently instituted to stop the recent wave of people thinking obscene thoughts about tomatoes , which Dorothy Quisling noted was one of the major problems of the new age of plenty and joy . -- Perry Metzger pmetzger @ shearson.com -- Laissez faire , laissez passer .

We 'll be riding some twisty , > fairly bumpy roads ( the Mines Road-Mt.Hamilton Loop for you SF Bay Areans ) . > An extended ride as a passenger on a 750 ninja . Owww . Well , I hate to be a wet sock , but , well ... I was a passenger on many bikes for the longest time before I started riding myelf , and I grew to hate long rides on sport bikes . The passenger seats are not designed for long rides . The passenger positions aren't even usually designed for short rides . I ended up torturing my knees and my back by taking long rides as a passenger on sport bikes . One of the reasons I originally liked my current guythingy so much was becase he had a BMW . : ) I 'd suggest a shorter extended ride at first -- a short turn in the mountains or some such . Then see how much pain she 's in , and proceed from there . The best advice I 'd give a beginning passenger : - Do n't get on the bike until the rider says its OK , and work out some sort signal for the rider to tell you when its OK to get off . After I get on the bike I squeeze my riders hips to tell that I 'm ready , and at the stop he nods his head to show its OK for me to get off . - Keep your feet on the pegs at all times . Do n't wiggle ( unless your rider asks you to : ) - The best passengers are those which are unobtrusive . Echo the movements and lean of your rider . Look over the shoulder thats most comfortable , but during turns look over the shoulder on the inside of the turn . - Get used to your rider 's shifting style ( Riders : use a reasonably consistent shifting style ) . Avoid `` helmet bonk . '' Helmet bonk is when your rider revs the bike up and then shifts and the sudden change in foreward acceleration causes your helmet to bonk his/hers . It gets old real fast . - When pulling to a stop , put a hand or both hands on the tank to keep your weight from pushing your rider up onto the tank . Putting your hands on the tank is also a good way to stretch your back if you 're in pain , but I 'm told it gets harder to steer in turns if you leave them there . - Switch your hands to the guardrail to stretch your shoulders , but be sure and squeeze your thighs while you 're doing it so your rider knows you're still there . : ) The guard rail is n't as safe as holding onto your rider . - Do n't be afraid to ask for frequent stops if you 're in pain or losing feeling in your feet . Passenger seats are not generally designed for comfort . Work out some sort of pull over signal beforehand . -- ********************************************************* Laura Lemay lemay @ netcom.com writer of trifles in shadows and blood *********************************************************

The police strategy of bursting in with weapons drawn , clearly marked as officers and yelling `` Police '' repeatedly . This is used every day to bust drug houses . The idea is to awe the suspects into submission with surprise and display of firepowere in order to avoid a gun fight . As for not knocking , it's a sad necessity in many cases since the suspects will attempt to escape or even fight . Usually this strategy works ; if it did n't , then it would n't be used so commonly , now would it ? Whether or not it was appropriate to use this strategy on the BD is not my point , since I do n't think any of us have enough information to make a clear judgement on this issue . I merely point out that it IS a valid strategy which is used every day . Furthermore , we do n't know of any substitute strategy capable of apprehending potentially dangerous and armed suspects . Do you suggest that the police always knock with guns holstered and never arrest any suspects until they have been allowed to inspect the officers 's badges ? Just what should the police do when apprehending potentially dangerous and armed suspects ? How far can they reasonably go to identiy themselves ? What do you suggest they can do which ca n't be faked by the `` competition '' ? Even if you 've got deadly enemies who may pretend to be cops , that 's not an excuse to murder police .

From : sherwood @ adobe.com ( Geoffrey Sherwood ) Subject : Hercules VLB ? Article-I.D . : adobe.1993Apr22.183309.25247 Organization : Adobe Systems Incorporated Lines : 28 X-Newsreader : TIN [ version 1.1 PL9 ] A couple of months ago I tried out a Hercules Graphite card . A pretty nice board . Fairly fast , and seemed quite compatible -- even seemed to handle the SVGA modes I have whined about here on occasion . At the time I was just buying a VLB system , so after checking out the card I sent it back . I wanted a VLB card , and purchased a Fahrenheit VLB card . This card is fairly fast , will do 70 Hz refresh at 1024x768 , but is not compatible with my CD-ROMS ( the SVGA thing -- I think ; I have merely conjectured that is the cause of an old graphics board being able to run in a higher resolution with those programs than the modern boards I have tried . I have not gotten a straight answer out of anybody ... ) . The monitor I am using it with is a 17 '' Magnavox , which also tops out at 1024x768x70 Hz so its really a pretty good match . But ... That is for my wife . I just purchased a Viewsonic 17 for myself , and am looking for a graphics card to drive it . I want > 70Hz refresh , and would really like it to handle my CD-Roms . I tried the Orchid P9000 , which did neither of those things ( though Robert at Wietek did say that the > 70Hz was possible if I modifed the driver data base ) . So my thoughts go back to Hercules . They were supposed to be coming out with a VLB version of the Graphite around the end of March . I have heard precisely ZERO about it since then . Does anyone know if the card was actually released , and what capabilities ( and price ) it has ? Any info would be most appreciated . Geoff Sherwood

The > battery is soldered to the bord , an all three machines is still under > guarentee so if that would have help we ca n't remove the batteries . As far as I know , there is no way to get around the BIOS password except by shorting out the power supply to the CMOS memory , thereby erasing it . This will remove the password , but it will also destroy all the previous BIOS settings , so then you 'll have to go and set them all up again . On my 386 , there is a jumper on the motherboard which is provided for the purpose of shorting the battery . You just short this jumper briefly , and it interrupts power to the CMOS long enough to erase it . I would imagine there is something like this on your board too . In the future , I would suggest that YOU set the password , and leave it on '' Setup '' only . That way , no-one else can go and reset it or set it to `` Always '' unless they know what password you used . They had to do this over here too when they got a bunch of new 386 's , for just the same reason . -Dale /~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\ | DALE M.

Case and point , the resurrection . By claiming that the resurrection actually happened the early preachers were able to convert many to Christianity . However , if you read Mathew 27:38 ( ? ) and the case for the resurrected saints who walked around Jerusalem and appeared to `` many People '' you would realize that other historians ( Josephus for one ) would have reported on it all if it happened . The fact that the Bible speaks of events of such great magnitude that they would have been noticed taken with the fact that they are not reported on by historians could only mean that the bible contains many made up stories .

The number of people showing up at the MOW hardly constitutes the entire queer populace . I doubt that it constitutes more than a handful of us . I 'm queer , and I wo n't be there , simply because I do n't have the time or the transportation . What the hell makes you think the participants in the MOW embody more than a minimum number ? Face it , people , we 're everywhere . There are always more of us than you think . Our numbers are constantly GROWING , not diminishing ... some of your children will grow up to join us . Hell , some of MY children may grow up to join us . The best way to deal with this phenomenon is not to fear it and blind yourself to it , but to realize that you have nothing to fear . We're not perverts , we 're not dangerous , we 're just here , and we 're human just like you -- er , most of you . Idiots like Cramer and Kaldis can rant all they like . It wo n't do them one iota of good . Drewcifer P.S .

Yeah , but who wants to start a pool on the first person arrested mistakenly and has their life turned upside-down because some law enforcement agency *does* make a chip : :person association ? I wonder if there are any plans to keep these records ( e.g . encode the serial number into the UPC scanned at K-Mart along with the credit card info , voila . ) At least your phone number tends to only locate to your house or whatever ( i.e . to be coming from your telephone number the person likely is in your house etc . ) , plus or minus some shenanigans of course . But I 'd hate to think of these guys getting the clipper id , recording the conversation , then doing a quick cross-lookup and your name comes up as owner of that id ( mistakenly , maybe you sold the phone at a garage sale or the phone was stolen from your car or whatever . ) They might only know who one side of the conversation is , for example . Anyone who thinks the govt is forbidden by law to cross-correlate such databases loses two points . First , law enforcement agencies can of course do this . Second , they 're only forbidden from BUDGETING any money for it . The IRS , for example , does do this anyhow . They just do n't spend any money on it so it 's ( technically ) legal I guess . Instead they probably trade little favors with companies like mastercard ( if you 're the IRS I 'll bet you have a *lot* of opportunities to trade favors with major corps for their databases . ) I know , an IRS guy read an amazing list off to me ( from his screen , I could hear him typing to pull up each screen ) once on the phone during a dispute I had with them ( to intimidate me , actually , not much of a dispute , I did n't particularly disagree , but for some reason this fellow wanted to play tough guy with me , I hope he 's better now . ) Amazing stuff he had at his finger tips .

Is the U used in the law enforcement field from the phone which placed the call , from the unit whose 'start secure session ' button was pressed first , or does each phone transmit its own law enforcement field ? Even assuming one of the first two choices , the FBI is going to get a fresh N , U for its own database about every other phone call , eventually accumulating keys for all the phones used to connect to the line they are monitoring , not just the 'suspects ' key .

It seems to me you 've offered a circular refutation of Moss 's organization . Who has shown the information in the latest book of PAC to be questionable ? Could it be those 'regulatory ' agencies and medical industries which Moss is showing to be operating with *major* vested interests . Whether one believes that these vested interests are real or not , or whether or not they actually shape medical research is a seperate argument . If one sees a possibility , however , that these interests exist , then the 'fact ' that some of the information put out by PAC has been refuted by the medical industry does n't hold much weight . As for the ineffectiveness of antineoplasteons , the fact that the NIH didn't find them effective does n't make much sense here . Of course they did n't ! I tend to have more faith in the word of the patients who are now alive after being told years ago that they would be dead of cancer soon . They are fighting like hell to keep that clinic open , and they credit his treatment with their survival . Anyone who looks at the NIH 's record for investigation of 'alterna- tive ' cancer therapies will easily see that they have a strange knack for find- ing relatively cheap and nontoxic therapies dangerous or useless . gn

I really do n't understand it . I agree with Nick . What 's the big deal about long games ? If you want to watch baseball , there 's that much more baseball to watch . And yes , baseball includes the space between plays as well as the plays themselves . I suspect that a lot of the complaining about long games , especially when it 's coming from TV people , has to something to do with advertising . Probably time `` wasted '' in the middle of an inning , say by a batter stepping out of the box to fiddle with his gloves , or by a pitcher walking around behind the mound trying to collect his thoughts , could otherwise be sold as advertising time .

It is a little known fact that a dog will involuntarily regurgitate and release an object that is too large to swallow . I was told that if I were ever attacked by a dog I should ball my hand in a fist and force it down the dog 's throat . The dog would naturally gag and release , and become momentarily disoriented . This commonly happens to humans when we go to a doctor and have our throats examined ( Proof Positive ) . In the time during the dog's disorientation , the next move would be to wrap an arm about the dog throat in a choke hold manner and constrict with all your might until the dog lapses into unconsciousness ( from lack of oxygen and halting blood flow ) . Finally , run like the wind to get away from the local area should the dog get up again and be really pissed . OOOOOOOpsssss .

People with early life hernias are felt to have a congenital sack that promotes the formation of hernias . The hernias of later life may be more associated with chronic straining . However , the risk of damage to the intestine without an operation is high enough that it ought to be repaired . The risk of cancer is probably no higher than the general population , but since you are near 40 , it would be sensible to have some sort of cancer screening , such as a flexible sigmoidoscopy .

Sorry , Fred , but for the purposes under discussion here , I must disagree . Your point is true only in the sense that one can not argue against communism by reference to the Chinese or Soviet empires , since those did not represent *true* communism . In judging the practical consequences of Islam as a force to contend with in the world today , it is precisely the Khomeini 's of the world , the Rushdie-fatwa supporters , and perhaps more importantly , the reaction of the world Muslim community to those extremists , that we must look to . Perhaps unfortunately from your perspective , most people are not concerned with whether Islam is the right religion for them , or whether the Qur'an could be used as a guidebook for a hypothetical utopia , but how Islam affects the world around them , or what their lives might be like if Islam gains in influence . When I consider such possibilities , it is with not inconsiderable fear . -- Jim Perry perry @ dsinc.com Decision Support , Inc. , Matthews NC These are my opinions .

What would you do differently ? In answering this > question , please accept NSA 's fundamental assumptions : that both > strong cryptography against outsiders , and the ability to wiretap > *some* domestic users , is necessary . I 'll accept the second assumption only for the sake of argument . In my view the primary remaining flaw is that the encryption algorithm is secret , leading to suspicion that there is a back door . Without complete disclosure this suspicion can not be dispelled , no matter how many trusted experts are allowed to look at it in isolation . Is it possible to do this whole thing with a public algorithm ? The only concern I 've seen with making Skipjack public is that someone could build Clipperphones without registering the keys . Assume F can really be kept secret as the Government assumes . Then as part of the initial connection , a Clipperphone executes a protocol with the Pseudophone to demonstrate that they both know F. For example , the initiating phone picks a number Q and sends E [ Q ; F ] . The receiver sends back E [ Q+1 ; F ] , and the initiator sends back E [ Q+2 ; F ] to demonstrate that her first packet was n't just a random 64-bit block . Repeat in the opposite direction with another Q so it ca n't be defeated by somebody building up a library of sequential numbers by remembering responses and using those responses as the initial numbers of subsequent challenges . This way Clipperphones will talk only to other Clipperphones . Of course the Pseudo Company can build their own proprietary Skipjack phone , but the Presidential Fact Sheet implies that they wo n't get approval for it without equivalent key escrow . What 's wrong with this picture ? It depends of F staying secret and on Skipjack being resistant to cryptanalysis , but the Government appears to believe in both of these . Even if the particular Q & A I suggest has some flaw , I imagine there 's a zero-knowledge-proof protocol that does n't . smb says : > The third , and most serious issue , is whether or not Clipper is a good > idea even if carried out strictly according to the letter of the law .

From the raw stats , there is no way to tell which of a first baseman 's putouts were made on throws from other fielders , and which were made on his own plays ; likewise , you ca n't tell whether a double play was 6-4-3 or 3-6-3 .

How would a pitch clock work on throws to first ? Maybe we could limit the number of throws to first that the pitcher can make , and award a balk if he exceeds it .

It may also increase the number of wild throws to the bag , since the pitcher knows he does n't have very many chances to pick off the runner , so he may hurry too much . I 'd rather see runs scored as the result of sound hitting and sound baseball strategy rather than on the sloppiness that could result from this kind of rule .

I 've heard comments here before about things like Turtle Wax and Raindance not being very good , so I 'm wondering what is recommended for a quality finish . Thanks in advance .

I feel that this is saying that it was because : of their lust after other men , who are flesh ( or of this world ) . : what are other opinons on this ? I have n't heard much about this verse : at all . Bo Reike in the Anchor Bible volume on _James , Peter , and Jude_ points out that all the examples given in this section of Jude are distinguishing the elect from _apostates_ , not just the wicked in general . Hence , those who were delivered from Egypt , but did not follow Moses ( and , by extension , God ) ; the apostate angels ; and Sodom and Gomorrah . Quoting Reike : '' Fornication may here , as often in the New Testament , refer to idolatry , while `` flesh '' ( as in I Pet 1:24 ) denotes human society and its violent attempts at self- exaltation . Sodom and Gommorrah represent the leaders of apostasy , and the surrounding cities correspond to their followers . '' [ p. 199 ] There is no inherent reason to read this verse ( 7 ) as literally referring to actual sexual lust for `` alien flesh '' . Nor is it inherently necessary to understand it as referring to homosexuality , outside of the circular reasoning that has already concluded that the sin of Sodom is the sin of homosexuality . The only place that the sin of Sodom is specified , and not merely inferred , is in Ezekiel 16:49 `` This was the guilt of your sister Sodom : she and her daughters had pride , excess of food , and prosperous ease , bit did not aid the poor and needy . They were haughty , and did abominable things before me ; therefore I removed them when I saw it . For the same reason ( overliteralizing the text ) your correspondent's suggestion that the reason the passage does n't deal with homosexuality is because the guests were angels and not men is just silly . There are much more solid reasons for pointing out the irrelevance of the Sodom passages for dealing with homosexuality per se . revdak @ netcom.com

Organization : Massachusetts Institute of Technology Lines : 30 NNTP-Posting-Host : alfredo.mit.edu Here 's the scoop : For the past two years , I have been using an SE/30 with a Sony 1304s and a Lapis video card . This past month , I bought a Quadra 800 and am now using the Sony on it . My SE/30 has been shipped home to my father who is planning on getting an Apple 14 '' monitor ( The Trinitron one ) . My question is this : What kind of power cord will he get with the Apple monitor . Does it come with two types ? As I recall , one can hook up the power cord of an apple monitor to the back of a machine such as my Quadra 800 . However , for my father 's SE/30 , there is no extra plug which allows use of the SE/30 's power supply . He needs to plug it into the socket separately . So ... does the monitor come with a cable that will allow him to do this ? Will have to buy a different cable ? IF yes , where can he purchase such a cable ? or apple kind enough to provide both types of cables ?

But the almalga- mation of theories and dogma that has accreted around them gives me an image of alien and inhuman creatures , untouched by sin or human desire .

I wo n't start yelling about how people are `` worshipping '' Mary , etc. , since folks have told me otherwise about that , but I do think we lose part of the wonder of God 's Incarnation in Christ when we make his parents out to be sinless , sexless , deathless , otherworldly beings . -- paul marxhausen ... . ... ... . ... ... ... ... . ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... . .. . . . . . university of nebraska - lincoln . . . .. . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . grace . . . . . . . . . . . . happens .

This is a very simplistic view of safety . Assuming that you are in a collision ( less likely with a more agile smaller car ) , then the important factor is how well does the car sacrifice itself to save you . This is why a thousand pound F1 car can hit a wall at 200 and the driver walks out and why everybody dies when a Suburban hits a wall at 35 ( as I recall for the last generation Suburban HIC numbers ) . As an aside , just what is the point of an airbag ? It seems to me that seatbelts with pretensioners ( Audi et al ) , or a good tight 5 point belt will prevent you every moving far enough to hit the airbag . You might be saved from some flyign glass ? Or is an airbag just a lowest common denominator safety device that is of some use in a head on collision when you are wearing no seat belt ? Craig > > - gerrit >

Maas < rem @ btr.com > -- Yet another place to search for FAQs in general is the SWITCH ( Swiss Academic and Research Network ) system in Switzerland : interactive : telnet nic.switch.ch [ 130.59.1.40 ] , login as `` info '' . Move to the info_service/Usenet/periodic-postings directory . Search in the 00index file by typing `` / '' and the word to look for . You may then just read the FAQ in the `` faqs '' directory , or decide to fetch it by one of the following methods . ftp : login to nic.switch.ch [ 130.59.1.40 ] as user anonymous and enter your internet-style address after being prompted for a password . cd info_service/Usenet/periodic-postings mail : send e-mail to RFC-822 : archive-server @ nic.switch.ch X.400 : /S=archive-server/OU=nic/O=switch/PRMD=switch/ADMD=arcom/C=ch/ Enter 'help ' in the bodypart to receive instructions . No information is required in the subject header line . 1 . ARCHIE ========= The Archie is a service system to locate FTP places for requested files . It 's appreciated that you will use Archie before asking help in the newsgroups . Archie servers : archie.au or 139.130.4.6 ( Aussie/NZ ) archie.funet.fi or 128.214.6.100 ( Finland/Eur . ) archie.th-darmstadt.de or 130.83.128.111 ( GER . ) cs.huji.ac.il or 132.65.6.5 ( Israel ) archie.kuis.kyoto-u.ac.jp or 130.54.20.1 ( JAPAN ) archie.sogang.ac.kr or 163.239.1.11 ( Korea ) archie.ncu.edu.tw or telnet 140.115.19.24 ( TWN ) archie.doc.ic.ac.uk or 146.169.3.7 ( UK/Ireland ) archie.sura.net or 128.167.254.179 ( USA [ MD ] ) archie.unl.edu ( password : archie1 ) ( USA [ NE ] ) archie.ans.net or 147.225.1.2 ( USA [ NY ] ) archie.rutgers.edu or 128.6.18.15 ( USA [ NJ ] ) archie.nz or 130.195.9.4 ( New Zealand ) Connect to Archie server with telnet and type `` archie '' as username . To get help type 'help ' . You can get 'xarchie ' or 'archie ' , which are clients that call Archie without the burden of a telnet session . 'Xarchie ' is on the X11.R5 contrib tape , and 'archie ' on comp.sources.misc , vol . 27 . To get information on how to use Archie via e-mail , send mail with subject `` help '' to `` archie '' account at any of above sites . ( Note to Janet/PSS users -- the United Kingdom archie site is accessible on the Janet host doc.ic.ac.uk [ 000005102000 ] . Connect to it and specify `` archie '' as the host name and `` archie '' as the username . ) ========================================================================== 2 . Notes ======== ( Excerpted from the FAQ article ) Please do *not* post or mail messages saying `` I ca n't FTP , could someone mail this to me ? '' There are a number of automated mail servers that will send you things like this in response to a message . There are a number of sites that archive the Usenet sources newsgroups and make them available via an email query system . You send a message to an automated server saying something like `` send comp.sources.unix/fbm '' , and a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail . ========================================================================== 3 .

The question of responsibility for the massacres or deportation of nearly all Ottoman Armenians has evolved into a polemic . Hundreds of books , articles , and documents have been published to describe the horrifying scenes of violence and death . Many writers , such as the British Bryce and Toynbee , French Pinon , German Lepsius , American Morganthau and Gibbons , have insisted that the massacres were predetermined and ruthlessly executed . The have refuted the Ottoman government 's official publications and justifications by substantiating that anti-Armenian measures were deliberated by the Ittihadists even before the outbreak of war . The fact remains than an estimated eight hundred thousand to over a million Armenians perished within a few months , and several hundred thousand more succumbed in the following years to the ravages of disease , famine , and refugee life .

G.B . ] `` Few people know of the problem I faced at UCLA when Professor Stanford Shaw was due for promotion . I knew him to be Turkey 's man ; due to my reading knowledge of Turkish and my seniority over him , I was a member of the promotion committee . For that case , I sat down and read his entire treatise `` History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey '' . It took me three months and I found out , from volume I , that he had plagiarized Uzun Jarsoglu , an eminent Turkish specialist on Ottoman history . Shaw himself claimed in his introduction that his treatise was the outcome of a 20-year search through the Ottoman Archives . Well , I went on leave and managed to show 40 % of Volume I , containing around 5000 sentences , to be the result of plagiarism , matching each sentence with passages from the original work . He had even reproduced the errors . So I produced a 500-pages manuscript and submitted a 60-pages report on Shaw 's plagiarism . The University , however , rejected my report and , after a closed meeting , promoted Stanford Shaw to Distinguished Professor . I paid a price for all this : upset by the whole process , I confronted the entire University structure and was considered to be a chauvinist and madman . I asked for permission to run a seminar on Shaw 's book that was denied by the President of the University . While the Center for Near Eastern Studies granted me permission , the President was depriving me of my academic freedom . Luckily , the Dean refused to give in and I did run the seminar , attended by more than 150 academic people , in which I uncovered Stanford Shaw , who refused to attend .

ESPN2 will be launched as early in September . Cap Cities are currently working with cable companies to ensure a good start-up base needed for a launch for any brand new cable service . The problem ESPN2 faces is the TCI-Cablevision connection in the merger of their Prime and SportsChannel networks . Prime SportsChannel will try to wrestle away NHL from ESPN in the off-season . Also , TCI and Cablevision have control a large number of cable systems around the country with a total of 15 million subscribers . TCI-Cablevision will do their best that ESPN2 never gets off the ground successfully . And the NHL 's value will suddenly skyrocket in this cable war between Prime SC and ESPN . NHL is more vital to the survival of a regionalized Prime SportsChannel since they virtually have no national major league sports contracts and only cover local NHL/NBA/MLB sports teams . -PPV Mark

Luke 16 talks about the rich man and Lazarus . Matthew 25 talks about the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels . Revelations 20 and 21 reference this fire as the place where unbelievers are thrown . Matthew 18 talks about being thrown into the eternal fire and the fire of hell . It seems quite clear that there is this place where a fire burns forever . From the Revelations passages it is clear that the devil and his angels will be tormented there forever . From the Matthew 25 passage it does n't seem abundantly clear whether the punishment of unbelievers is everlasting in the sense of final or in the sense of continual . From Dale 's question , I come away with the suggestion that hell , if it were short , might be an acceptable alternative to living forever with the Source of Life , Peace and Joy i.e . the unbeliever ceases to exist . Whereas , if punishment goes on continually , then one should have a greater motivation to avoid it . It definately seems to me that hell is something we want to avoid regardless of its exact nature . There seem to be two main questions in Dale 's thought : What is God 's main plan on earth ? Why is continual punishment a necessary part of hell as opposed to simply destroying completely those who refuse God ? I believe that God 's main plan is to have a genuine relationship with people . The nature of hell and the reasons for its nature seem a lot more difficult to ascertain . It does seem clear that hell is something to avoid . At a minimum , hell is the state one is in when one has nothing to do with God . In the Bible , I am not aware of any discussion about the specifics of hell beyond the general of hot , unpleasant and torment . For instance , it is not discussed how ( if at all ) the rich man can continually stay in the fire and still feel discomfort or pain or whether there is some point at which the pain sensing ability is burned up . If you can forgive the graphicalness , if you throw a physical body into a fire , assuming the person starts out alive , at some fairly quick point , the nerves are destroyed and pain is no longer sensed . It is not stated what occurs when at the judgement , the unbelievers , ( who are already physically dead ) are cast into hell i.e . they no longer have a physical body so they ca n't feel physical pain . What could be sensed continually is that those in hell are to be forever without God . The Lazarus/rich man parable is told with the idea of having the listener think in physical terms in order to get the point that some people wo n't listen to God even after he rises from the dead . The point of the parable is to reach the hard-hearted here who are not listening to the fact of the resurrection nor the Gospel about Jesus Christ . It seems reasonable to also draw from the parable that hell is not even remotely pleasant . -- Peter White disclaimer : None of what is written necessarily reflects a view of my company .

I do n't think that it is `` obvious '' that `` lots '' of people are willing to pay the price . I 'm sure someone out there in net-land has some facts about trends in attendance regarding percentage of capacity sold . But even if the trends are relatively flat , you have to consider what is happening on a team-by-team basis . When the TV money dries up , franchises will be seeking to supplant the lost revenues from alternative sources . One of the best sources may be ticket sales . Example 1 : The Dodgers The Dodgers can count on a strong base of season ticket sales and *probably* believe that they have the ability to raise prices without hindering revenues . I certainly think that is true . Example 2 : The Padres They will be lucky to average 10,000 fans a game this year . If they raise prices , less . If they want to increase their overall revenue base , the best thing they can do is put a winning team on the field . But given that wo n't happen ( it wo n't ) , they can probably make more money by lowering ticket prices and running frequent promotions . Will they do that ? I have no idea . But they wo n't increase prices , because it wo n't work *for them* . > 2 ) even assuming that you have some strange power to make the owners > decrease ticket prices , that does not decrease the tv contract . The only strange powers at work here are the forces of the market place . Each team 's market is somewhat different , and each owner is going to be faced with a unique set of circumstances about how to deal with those market forces . As a buiness manager , I would never *want* to lower my prices , but sometimes that strategy is necessary , and sometimes it works .

This sounds an awful lot like a password-guesser , not a weakness in DES . Merritt and I pointed out this weakness in Kerberos in a paper that came out about 2.5 years ago , in both Computer Communications Review and Usenix . For that matter , it was loudly discussed on the Kerberos mailing list even earlier . The problem has nothing whatsoever to do with DES , and everything to do with bad password selection . I 'm perfectly willing to believe that there are cryptanalytic attacks possible on DES . I 'm quite dubious that private research labs know them . And the parameters of a brute-force attack are quite well established ; see , for example , the Garon and Outerbridge paper in the July '91 Cryptologia . You 're not going to do it in an hour with only `` rather powerful DES hardware '' . I 'll leave the arithmetic as an exercise for the reader . On average , you 'll need to do 2^55 trials .

For myself , as a Catholic , I see my own opposition to capital punishment as much the same as my opposition to abortion - a reverence for life . Here in the UK , the anti-abortion case is often let down by the explicit link which those on the political left make with anti-abortionists and pro-executionists . There is a tendency to condemn people who hold both views as hypocrites . I feel that if there were many more anti-abortionists who were also vocal in their opposition to capital punishment on a pro-life line , it would end this kneejerk association of anti-abortion as a right-wing thing , and get many to think seriously about the issue ( there are plenty who are pro-abortion equally for a kneejerk left-wing reason ) . I do not think your biblical quote can automatically be taken as support for capital punishment .

I 've just spent 3 hours catching up on sci.crypt here ( slow reader I guess ) and I really have to put out a few comments too . First , let me flame the famous Dave S. : He 's obviously only 10 years old . Cut him some slack . : ^ } The joke about Clinton/crypto/drugs slammed me thru the roof . Nice job guys ! I 've been working on marijuana legalization for over 5 years now , Clinton 's actions so far have really helped . But because of government action taken against various other groups , I have developed a 64 bit DES based on public literature to protect my mailing list . The S-boxes are the critical component , and since I chose 32 out of 57 based on the key , cracking this DES is going to tough . ( The reason it slows you down a touch is that for each key you try you need to use a different set of s-boxes , I know it 's only a vector , but it sure makes random search a pain ) . Several marijuana legalization groups have had their mailing lists confiscated when people were charged with drug use/sales . It 's not a crime to be a member of a legalization org , *but* you will be watched . It really is important to write a letter to every official you personally vote for to explain *why* your privacy is being destroyed by the `` cripple chip '' . Amazingly enough they do listen when they get *enough* mail . The Doonsbery jokes about NRA postcards are real , and the IMI ( Illinois Marijuana Initiative ) has grown to the point where we *are* seeing some changes . It 's pretty clear that all the hullabaloo is really about the implimentation decision being made behind our backs . As Vesselin points out , this was common practice in communist regimes ( and may be again depending on how the vote goes ) . But just as criminals have guns and `` law abiding '' citizens do n't , and criminals like me have marijuana and `` law abiding '' subjects do n't , criminals like me will have secure crypto while `` law abiding '' robots do n't . PGP is nice , but as time goes on we all can do better . And to save our hides we will . Someone posted an excerpt from Machiavelli . He 's my favorite dude . 500 years ago he saw clearly how people *are* , and tried to explain that to `` princes '' who wanted people to *obey* . One section not quoted ( I 've got `` The Prince '' at home , so I 'll just paraphrase : ) ) had to do with conquring a free city . The only way is to *completly destroy* it . Failing that , you must appoint locals to high positions and accept the people 's customs . Even after 100 years of oppression , a people will remember their heratige and rise up to overthrow the oppresive government . And he gave an example . And that was 300 years *before* Thomas Jefferson . There were questions about watching traffic . Only *interesting* traffic is watched : stuff that goes overseas and comes back ; stuff with keywords like marijauana , cryptography , NSA ; certain individuals who are known subversives , etc . It is easy enough to store all that traffic . So if you know how to be *subversive* i.e . how to be unseen , it 's pretty easy to go unnoticed for a long time . The stronger your crypto system and the less you 're noticed , the better your chances of developing an organization which can diseminate truth to the masses . Which gets me to the thread about a `` public encrypted conference '' . That 's just silly . The first thing the feds do is send in an infiltrator ( like Dave S. ) and they know what you 're doing . It will be fun for teenagers and college students , but for the real world it's pretty pointless . Crypto is useful for more things than hiding where you get your marijuana . Guns , drugs and crypto do have some commonality : there are people in government who want you to *obey* their rules . As Lundquist says in alt.drugs `` Live free or do n't '' . Machiavelli pointed out that 's just how most people actually live , inspite of appearences to the contrary . It 's true that the decision to shove the clipper ( not the same thing as Intergraph 's ! ! ! ) down our throats violates the principles of what the U.S. was founded on , but the government is full of idiotic robots called bureaucrats and there 's less to worry about than one might think . Only really innocent ( read naive ) subjects of the U.S. will be hurt by this , the rest of us *criminals* will live in secure freedom . de Toqueville pointed out 150+ years ago that the tyranny of the majority will be mitigated by the mediocrity of the government . And given what I see government officials doing where I work ( Argonne National Lab . ) the level of stupidity makes Dave S. look smart .

[ NOTE : The AP > puts out boxscores in three different formats with the one you see in > most newspapers being the first one ] Not totally true . For the past year or two , the AP has been getting box scores from STATS , Inc . The AP representative in the press box is actually a STATS reporter ( $ 25 dollars a game , but free parking . And anybody can do it . ) The box is downloaded to STATS in Chicago , some quick error checking is done , and then STATS sends it to the AP . I 'm not sure where the appreveiations come in hear . I do n't think it is at STATS 's . It may just be a space correction by the AP sports editor that day . While I 'm mentioning STATS reporters , they are always looking for new people . Especially if you live in Cleveland or Pittsburgh , you 're road to getting into the press box may be real short . For more info , call STATS ( 708 ) 676-3322 , and ask about the reporter network .

How much data per > bit will be lost in average ( I assume you still have the correct key ) ? It depends on the mode you 're using . For a single 64-bit input block , a one-bit error will have a 50 percent chance of corrupting each of the 64 output bits - in other words , it essentially turns the output block into a random number . If you 're encrypting data in CBC mode , however , only the one 64-bit block will be affected . The next block , and all that follow it will be decrypted properly . It 's a good idea to have some kind of error correction in your system if corrupted bits are likely . - Todd

Is ( was ? : - ( ) your HG zipper the nylon-coil type or the kind with molded plastic teeth ? I 've only tried it on the coiled nylon type , and it does n't take much squish to fix the problem . I found I was overdoing it ( no broken parts , but the zipper was too hard to pull ) so after spreading the zipper pull jaws again , I tried with Vice-Grips . No , not the usual Grip Of Death technique , I adjusted the closed Vice-Grips so they were snug on the zipper jaws , then released them and tightened the adjusting screw a bit . A couple of iterations and I had just the right amount of Zipper Squish ( TM ) . > Result : I now know that noplace in Spokane will even _consider_ trying > to repair a broken zipper-closer-thingy , which must be a $ 0.30 part > which needs a $ 20 tool to install . I 've had two zipper pulls fail on my Aerostich suit ( actually on the Accessory Ellipse ) , and they sent me a few replacement pulls free of charge . I do n't know what brand of zippers HG uses , but parts ARE available for YKK 's plastic zippers . Replacement was pretty simple , just break and remove the plastic knob at the top of the zipper that keeps the pull from coming off the top end . Slide on the new zipper pull . Then crimp on ( Vice-Grips again ! ) a replacement zipper stop . You might try fabric stores & such and see if they sell replacement parts .

I have a display that is a non-interlaced , memory mapped , 1-bit 720x280 display . The server 's view of the world , ( obtained via xwd | xwud ) , seems to be exactly what it should be . However , the displayed version of the framebuffer gives the impression that the server is using scanlines that are too long . After a bit of experimentation , it seems that the problem was that the server was padding the line out to a word boundry , but the scanline size in the buffer is 90 bytes , which is n't exactly divisible by four . Changing the following defines in mit/server/include/servermd.h : -- -- # define BITMAP_SCANLINE_PAD 32 # define LOG2_BITMAP_PAD 5 # define LOG2_BYTES_PER_SCANLINE_PAD 2 -- - to : -- - # define BITMAP_SCANLINE_PAD 16 # define LOG2_BITMAP_PAD 4 # define LOG2_BYTES_PER_SCANLINE_PAD 2 -- - Was not exactly the right solution . How do I tell the server either ( a ) do n't pad the scan lines at all ( 'cause this server is only being built to run on this particular display ) , or to pad only to byte boundries ? I 'm using a customized version of XFree86v1.2 , under Mach 3.0 . Thanks Brian

However , I hope that her immune system will be stronger to fight these diseases , so she would be less severely affected . Everytime she has a cold , we make sure she blow her nose frequently and give her Dorcol or Dimetapp at night so she can have good rest ( thanks to some suggestions from the net ) . That 's about all the care she needs from us . I try very hard to keep her off antibiotics . Twice her ped . gave me choice to decide whether she would have antibiotics .

From : ttknock @ SantaFe.edu ( Boss Hogg ) Subject : POV animating Organization : The Santa Fe Institute Lines : 20 NNTP-Posting-Host : sanjuan.santafe.ede X-Newsreader : TIN [ version 1.1 PL8 ] In an attempt to do animation with POV I have created two little programs . One is a C program that will perform a `` morph '' between any two points given the amount of frames for the morph . And then it will write the points , and the function ( translate , rotate , etc . ) out to a file . Then I have a Perl script that will read the list of functions and insert them into a .pov file at a given line . I had hoped this would let me do simple animation . However , I have discovered that simply performing incremental rotations on an object will not spin a stationary object but will actually rotate the object about the axis . Now I know an easy way around this would be to first translate the object to the origin perform the rotation and then move it back but I know there must be another way around this . I had thought perhaps it was because I had created objects at the origin and then translated them to a new point and then done the rotation , which could cause this behavior . However this occurs on objects that are not translated at all . Any help is appreciated . ttknock @ bbs.santafe.edu

I 'd use a secret ( nope , obscure ) cryptographic encoding to expand the 30 bit serial number to a 64 bit block . The redundancy hereby introduced can be used to detect tampered Clipper signals where some public enemy replaced the L.E . block by random data . And of course the L.E . block would be used to initialise the encryption of the user data so that at the receiving end the correct L.E . block must be processed in order to have any chance of getting the plaintext back . For those of you who might want to mangle the L.E . block ( e.g . by xor-ing a constant pattern ) on the transmission line and restore it before feeding it into the receiving Crippler Chip I would add further encrypted copies of this block ( perhaps created by repeated application of the encryption algorithm or so ) at regular intervals during the transmission . If the receiving chip detects a mismatch it must assume that the line is bad and it will cease to work ; in your own interest you are protected from getting faulty plaintext , you know -- it 's just like a checksum for your own safety ; - ( . The ` monitoring agencies ' wo n't have the famous black box which is needed for actual decryption and will be kept by the FBI ; but nothing prevents them from using special boxes which will do the redundancy check for the serial number block and consistency checks on the embedded L.E . blocks within the transmission . These boxes will turn a red light on as soon as they detect a bitstream that violates the correct protocol . So do n't anyone think that you can use the chip and fool L.E . about the tapping key -- I bet the developpers have provided much better checks than those suggested above . Of course it 's absolutely crucial that the algorithms ( and protocols ) remain secret . Personally I doubt they will . -- Detlef Lannert DC3EK E-Mail : tsos @ rz.uni-duesseldorf.de PGP 2.2 key via server or finger lannert @ clio.rz.uni-duesseldorf.de '' I am Psmith .

Funny . I did n't realize Mr. Tanner brought up Bob Knepper v. Pam Postema in the first place . Thought it was someone named Jacobs . > If someone posts something as controversial ( not to mention > idiotic ) as what Austin posted in a widely accessed newsgroup , > someone should challenge the statement . Why ? If a statement is truly idiotic , and is universally thought so , the challenge is a waste of panting . Further , challenges that have nothing ( yes , nothing ) to do with *baseball* are wasting others ' time . You got a problem with what Bob Knepper thinks ? Let 's hear it , in some sort of categorical manner . ( Actually , I question whether either Knepper or Postema are n't `` old news '' at this point , although what I have read of Postema 's book is interesting . ) > There is a school of thought that suggests that silence = consent .

Do n't you want people who come to this group to talk baseball to think you like to do the same ? Or do you want them to think you 're some politically correct demagogue who 's oh-so sensitive ? ( Ho-hum . ) Plus , you 're here limiting free speech to `` some obscure newsgroup that I do n't read . '' What BS . You got a problem with what Jacobs says , what Knepper thinks , all you have to do is defeat it with better ideas , more and better speech . Yours is the easy way out . As for Knepper : ever notice how sometimes these guys will say just about any darn thing that pops in their heads when a mike is shoved in front of them ? You know that often the best copy for the news is the one that isn't pre-prepared . They know Knepper has controversial ideas about women , they pop some question about Postema . ( An interesting related question would be whether the two ever appeared in the same game . Off the top of my head , I guess `` no . '' If my guess is right , Knepper popped off about something that had nothing to do with him -- and Postema gets a book for it , and he does n't . ) > Now , of course , you do n't have to read any of this . > And if you want to cut down on flames , then DO N'T POST FLAMEBAIT ! > ( You do n't have to respond to flames , either .

As a VERY COARSE rule of thumb , you can figure that the final price of a product is 3 to 5 times the Cost Of Goods . ( The exact multiplier depends largely on economies of scale : Products that sell tens of millions of units/year will be at the low end , those that sell thousands of units/year will be at the high end . I suspect cellular phones are in the middle ) . This implies that adding a $ 25 chip would increase the cost of the phone by approx $ 100 , or about 25 % - 30 % .

From : jab55062 @ uxa.cso.uiuc.edu ( The World Reknown Jason Boskey ) Subject : Re : Blues sweep Hawks Keywords : Blues , Hull , Janney , Joseph , Hawks , Belfour Organization : University of Illinois at Urbana Lines : 27 While I will first congratulate the Blues for their victory , I think it must be realized that the primary reason the Blues were able to win was Curtis Joseph . When a goalkeeper gets hot , there is little an opposing team can do . Joseph should be given the entire city of St. Louis , because otherwise there would probably be a game 6 scheduled . As for the game on Sunday . The Blues caught a few breaks , without a doubt . One was the Referee constantly watching the Blackhawks , looking for reasons to give them penalties . Second , The Blues first goal resulted because the puck hit the linesman as the Blackhawks attempted to clear . No linesman , no shot for Brett ( I can redirect anything ) Hull to redirect . On another of St. Louis' goals , Belfour was tripped from behind as he went to make the save by someone who did n't belong in the crease , which means it was a St. Louis player . Finally , the overtime goal was caused because someone kept Belfour from getting back to the crease . No goalie , no way to stop the shot . I congratulate St. Louis for beating the Hawks . It will be a shame to see Bryan Murray finally advance to the Campbell Conference Finals because Joseph wo n't be able to stop the powerful Red Wing attack . ____________________________________________________________________________ |The World Reknown Jason Boskey | Mail : Bosk @ uiuc.edu | |Known throughout the World as The Bosk | '' Christ , you know it ai n't easy , | |All Rights Reserved , All Lefts Enhanced |You know how hard it can be , | | -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -|The way things are goin ' | | '' Here they come spinning out of the turn '' |They 're gon na crucify me '' | -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

Anyone recall other safety features ? The engine was an american v-8 , Ford I think is right . Personally , I kinda like the way they look , and if I remember from the old magazine articles , the performance was only half-bad . The choice of colors , though , tended towards the 1970s lime green - yech - but highly visible , I suppose . The Delorean , on the other hand , was a dog - nice looking ( IMO ) but no motor at all .

Any comments from Phototransistor experts ? ) We intended to use this atop a stepper motor , to provide headings to the beacons . The plan was to have 3 or 4 beacons , of different frequencies , in each room , and tell the 567 what frequency to phase-lock to . We did not do so . One challenge was that the available stepper had 8 degree steps ! Knowing the headings to each beacon , we would have used the surveyor technique of RESECTION to determine robot location . ( No , I ai n't going to explain resection over the net . ) Given hindsight , I would digitize the amplified output of the self-nulling phototransistor circuit , and correlate in-phase & quadrature square-waves at the several expected frequencies , to extract AMPLITUDE of each beacon . By doing this at the numerous steps , even with 8 degree steps , with knowledge of the angular response of the phototransistor , you SHOULD be able to rather more accurately determine the heading to each beacon .

I need help finding a company that will take photographic images scanned in and modified by Adobe Photoshop and turn them into thermal prints or negatives . I am looking for a place as close to North Carolina as possible . The images will be created on a Macintosh Quadra 800 running Adobe Photoshop and will then be stored in whatever format the vendor requires , perhaps 88M cartridges ? The images will be black and white photographs scanned in with a 1200 dpi scanner then modified/corrected by Adobe Photoshop . If anyone could help me or even give me phone numbers to people who could I would be very grateful . Also if anyone else is doing what I am planning I would be happy to hear from you with any advice you might provide as to the computer system you use and/or any peripherals or software . It seemed the Quadra 800 would be my best bet to modify photographic images . I am planning on buying a Quadra 800 with 32Megs of RAM , a 510Meg Hard Drive , a 1200 dpi scanner , 17 '' Sony monitor and a 88Meg cartridge drive and perhaps a CD ROM .

So let 's keep the parallel . Since the gross numbers are n't the same , we 'll need a proportionality value . Should we use : * Gazan vs Jewish initial population ? * Gazan vs Jewish death rates ? * Gazans vs Jews who survived five years of occupation ? * Israelis vs Nazis attacked by the 'resistance ' ? * Israelis vs Poles charged with aiding the victims ? Since the two cases are so comparable , it should n't matter which we pick , they 'll all be about the same , right ? -- -- -- -- -- -- Contrary to popular hyperbole , the IDF *could* quite easily kill off the entire population of Gaza in hours if they wanted to .

So if a `` Final Solution '' for Gaza would be so much better from a *Realpolitik* standpoint , why does n't Israel go for it ?

It was explained that two news photographers were found on the compound earlier this morning without permission . It was explained to the press corps . that this is dangerous and that an unknown photographer turning around with a long lens camera could be mistaken for someone dangerous by a Texas Ranger surveying the site . ( ! ) The two photographers were said to be currently in jail and the press were warned to follow the authorities ' guidelines . It was also emphasized that the survey of the `` crime '' scene at this point was crucial and that the press could not be allowed to interfere . The press will not be allowed in until the bodies are removed and the site has been completely surveyed for evidence for a court case . That is the gist of the beginning of the conference to the best of my memory . I bring this up because I have n't seen anyone else note it and I have n't seen the regular newscasts mention it . It will probably be mentioned in the papers tomorrow . My opinions : -- -- -- -- -- - I find this disturbing . While I believe that Koresh is largely responsible for not ending this standoff in a peacable manner during the last 51 days of patient opportunity , I find the secrecy surrounding the aftermath more damaging to the authorities ' position than they realize . Since the vast majority of potential defendents in a court case are already dead , the emphasis on the importance of building the court case seems overblown to me . It will be interesting to see the hearings on this affair . I have also heard congressional calls for a review and possible overhaul of government enforcement agencies which you will recall I have stated would be a good idea in previous months . Please also note that I by no means endorse or agree with the many conspiracy-type theories I have read here and in other groups .

The polls that you refer to , for the Canadian data , are from the annual July 1st polls conducted for Macleans ( our major English newsmagazine ) by Decima Research ... Decima president Allen Gregg is considered one of the world 's top poll researchers , and Mulroney's Conservatives have relied on him to keep in power in the face of impossible election situations . The American polls are Harris polls , and have been reposted on USENET a few times and probably will again .

For those who 've not had the pleasure : It is a MIDI controlled ( no keyboard of it 's own ) rackmountable digital voice processor . What can it do with your voice ? It can pitch-shift it ( change the notes you sing ) . It can add harmonies to your singing ( up to 5 parts at one time ) . It can change your voice into a synthesizer 's voice but leave what you say alone and intelligible . This works well for a `` computerized '' sounding singer , or robot voice . For those of you who just thought about that , yes - you can do the voices from Robo-Cop , and the old ELO lead-ins with it , and yes - I 'm a little red-faced to say that I tried those specifically . For an input , it takes both : XLR ( 3-prong mic ) and 1/4 '' cables . For output , you can have a combination of the original-input-only , and your choice of mix between the original signal and the effect ( can be effect only if desired ) . It has preset setups , which you can edit and save for your own preferences . It has a couple of light scratches , but does not look bad , and works flawlessly . Even when we do n't use it in my music , it 's been good for after-hours fun in the studio . The manual is included . I never got around to getting rack-ears for it , but it has only gotten studio use from me - no roading , so it 's not beaten . -- oooooooo o o Steve Hitch oo o oo oo My opinions are my own .

In the list you mentioned , tgif handles everything except rotation and any size text . It only supports 90 degrees rotation . Currently , it supports 11 ( X11R4 standard ) font sizes . However , it allows arbitrary scaling of the entire drawing . Effectively , it allows any font sizes , but you can only have 11 different sizes per drawing . Tgif takes up 850K ( compiled with -O option ) on a SPARCstation . I was told that it compiles under Linux , but I have n't tried it yet .

'' I also wonder about my computer being harmed by fluctuations in voltage from other things ( garbage disposal , etc . ) Here are my questions : How much harm do voltage fluctuations cause ? My computer does not share a circuit with anything big but our my light dims when a refrigerator comes on or the garbage disposal is turned on ( whose does n't ? ) , and also when the washing machine does anything . All these things cause a drop in voltage which is harmful to a computer , right ? I also notice the fan in my System Saver turning at different speeds . Is it safer to turn it off and back on when I want to use it or to leave it on ? How much electricity does my computer use ? I have an Apple IIgs ( ne flames ) , with a Kensington System saver GS ( 1 electric fan inside ) , an AppleColor RGB monitor , and an EXTERNAL 3.5 '' HD ( 1 fan and its own P/S ) . How do I translate this into Kilowatt-Hours ? Also , how much of this is used by the monitor ? Does the monitor use considerably less juice when the screen is totally black but still on ? Many computers spin the HD up and down constantly to save power . I always thought this was harmful to the HD and defeats the purpose of leaving the computer on in the first place ( except portables ) . Is this true ? Thanks for the Info .

Once I > saw an orthodontists records complete with photographs showing how one of > his patients severe underbite was cured by constant prayer . It 's a common fallacy you commit . The non-falsifiability trick . How can I prove it when not all the evidence may be seen ? Answer : I ca n't . The fallacy is in assuming that it is up to me to prove anything . When I say it has never been proven , I 'm talking about the ones making the claims , not the skeptics , who are doing the proving . The burden of proof rest with the claimant . Unfortunately , ( pontification warning ) our legal system seems to be headed in the dangerous realm of making people prove their innocence ( end pontification ) . But truthfully , Corinthians was so poorly written ( or maybe just so poorly translated into English ) that much remains unknown about just what Paul really intended ( despite claims of hard proof one way or another ) . Some will see his writings in 1 cor 12-14 as saying do n't do this do n't do this and using sarcasm , metaphor , etc . while yet others take what he says literally sarcasms and metaphors notwithstanding . Me ? When I read 1 Cor 14 about praying/speaking in tongues regarding building oneself/the church , I see him using compare/contrast , saying do this because it build the church , while doing this builds onself ( implying do n't do that ) . It 's a common usage of writing that we all employ , and it is easily seen how it COULD be interpreted this way . Why some do and some do n't is a mystery .

It is your responsibility for posting quotes in context . Your phony 'research center ' is the source of the most unscholarly , out-of-context , agenda-ridden , and sophmoric propaganda that I have ever seen . Do n't believe me , folks ? Let 's take a little stroll through a few of Elias Davidsson 's contributions to our understanding of the middle east . ED > Quotations from Zionist leaders ED > 1 . `` There was no such thing as Palestinians '' ED > ( Golda Meir , Prime Minister of Israel , London Sunday ED > Times , 15 June 1969 ) And what do suggest that she meant by this ? Do you think she meant that the Palestinians do n't exist ? Or does it actually mean that the people who self-identify as 'Palestinians , ' did not appear to be a distinct ethnic group in the eyes of Golda Meir ? ED > 2 . `` There is , however , a difficulty from which the Zionist ED > dares not avert his eyes , though he rarely likes to face it . ED > Palestine proper has already its inhabitants . '' ED > ( Israel Zangwill , The Voice of Jerusalem , London 1920 , ED > p.88 ) When this was written , seventy three years ago , the people of the region were not all Jews . They are not all Jews now . No Jew but the most rabid bigot has ever called for an Israel to be ONLY for Jews . That was true then . It is true now . ED > `` [ The Palestinians are ] beasts walking on two legs . '' ED > ( Menachem Begin , Prime Minister of Israel in a speech to ED > the Knesset , ED > quoted in Amnon Kapeliouk , 'Begin and the `` Beasts '' , New ED > Statesman , 25 June 1982 ) Since you inserted the words 'The Palestinians are ' we can not know what Begin was talking about . For someone who wants to embellish his own importance with an absurd pseudo-organizational name like the 'Center for Policy Research , ' you are not a very honest person . ED > `` Both the process of expropriation [ of the Palestinians ] ED > and the removal of the poor must be carried out ED > discreetly and circumspectly '' . ED > ( Dr. Theodor Herzl , The Complete Diaries , Herzl Press , ED > 1960 , I. , p.88 ) Herzl died eighty nine years ago . Are you suggesting that he has stated what is Israel 's policy today ? Have you ever seen Israel even entertain a policy to exclude non-Jews , let alone actually try to remove non-Jews from Israel ? If you actually believe that this quote has anything to do with Israel 's non- Jewish citizenry today , you are an idiot . But if you realize that Israel has no intention of removing non-Jewish Israelis , then you are nothing but a common liar . This one time I will give you the benefit of the doubt , and assume you are stupid . ED > `` We shall try to spirit the penniless population [ the ED > Palestinians ] across the border by procuring employment ED > for it in the transit countries , while denying it any ED > employment in our own country '' ED > ( Theodor Herzl , The Complete Diaries , Herzl Press , 1960 , ED > I , p.88 ) Once again you quote a man gone for almost a century . You do so within the context of modern day Israel . Thomas Jefferson owned slaves . How does this fact define the United States today ? ED > `` [ Jews ] must expel Arabs and take their place '' ED > ( David Ben Gurion , 1937 , quoted in Shabtai Teveth , Ben ED > Gurion and the Palestine Arabs , Oxford University Press , ED > 1985 , p. 89 ) Did he say 'Jews , ' or did you add this ? This was also a statement from ten years before Israel became a state . It has no bearing on Israel . ED > `` We must do everything to ensure they [ the ED > Palestinian refugees ] never do return '' ED > ( David Ben Gurion , in his diary , 19 July 1948 , quoted in ED > Michael Bar Zohar , Ben Gurion : The Armed Prophet , ED > Prentice-Hall , 1967 , p.157 ) YOU added the words 'the Palestinian refugees . ' And by doing so , you are misleading people into believing that Ben Gurion , who was expressing his hope that people who fled their lands , at the encouragement of people such as KING ABDULLAH , and the MUFTI OF JERUSALEM , was gloating over people abandoning their homes . What he was refering to were the Arabs with whom Jews were at war . ED > `` The country was mostly an empty desert , with only ED > a few islands of Arab settlement '' ED > ( Shimon Peres , Minister of Defense , quoted in David 's ED > Sling : The Arming of Israel , Weidenfeld and Nicholson , ED > 1970 , p.249 ) At the time of the rebirth of Israel this was certainly true , especially when compared to what Israel has accomplished in a few short decades . ED > `` All this story about the danger of extermination [ of ED > Jews ] has been blown up ... .to justify the annexation of ED > new Arab territories '' ED > ( Mordechai Bentov , Israeli Cabinet Minister , Al ED > Hamishmar , 14 April 1972 ) Since Israel has not annexed even one millimeter of territory in more twenty six years , this quote is irrelevant . ED > `` Neither Jewish ethics nor Jewish tradition can ED > disqualify terrorism as a means of combat '' ED > ( Yitzhak Shamir , Hehazit , Summer 1943 [ Journal of the ED > LEHI , the Stern Gang ] , translated from the Israeli daily ED > Al-Hamishmar , 24 December 1987 Again , you are quoting a man who was fighting for what he had been promised from a time as ancient as biblical , to the time of the Balfour Declaration , just a few short years back . And what was thought of and described as terrorism by Jews didn't include slaughtering Olympic athletes , brutally murdering the innocent , attacking school buses , and murdering another human being for the sole reason that he or she is an Arab . ED > `` The domination of Jewish agriculture by Arab ED > workers is a cancer in our body '' ED > ( A. Uzan , Israeli Minister of Agriculture , Ha'aretz , 13 ED > December 1974 ) There were serious concerns about a work force that consisted of people from OUTSIDE Israel . It is a wise to be concerned . A work force consisting of foreigners is not a good situation for a country . ED > `` There can be only one national home in Palestine , ED > and that a Jewish one , and no equality in the partnership ED > between Jews and Arabs '' ED > ( Montague David Eder , President of the Zionist ED > Federation of Great Britain , 1931 , ED > in Doreen Ingrams , comp. , Palestine Papers 1917-1922 , ED > Seeds of Conflict , George Braziller , 1973 , p. 135 ) This also has no meaning for a country formed seventeen years after this statement was made . Obviously times change . This is NOT what Israel is about today . I believe the peace talks make this quote irrelevant . ED > `` There is not a single Jewish village in this country ED > that has not been built on the site of an Arab village '' ED > ( Moshe Dayan , Ha'aretz , 4 April 1969 ... ) This is completely false . ED > `` Some people talk of expelling 700,000 to 800,000 ED > Arabs in the event of a new war , and instruments have ED > been prepared '' ED > ( Aharon Yariv , former chief of Israeli military ED > intelligence , 1980 , Inquiry , 8 December 1980 ) Expelled from where ? Israel ? The occupied territories ? New Jersey ? Is there any way we can read this and get an idea as to what on earth he was talking about . Obviously not . ED > `` We should there [ in Palestine ] form a portion of the ED > rampart of Europe against Asia , an outpost of civilization ED > as opposed to barbarism . '' ED > ( Dr. Theodor Herzl , The Jewish State , London , 1896 , p. ED > 29 ) Interesting notion . Considering that this was written nearly a century ago , it is quite visionary . ED > `` I deeply believe in launching preventive war ED > against the Arab States without further hesitation . By ED > doing so we will achieve two targets : firstly , the ED > annihilation of Arab power ; and secondly , the expansion ED > of our territory '' ED > ( Menachem Begin , in a speech to the Knesset , 12 October ED > 1955 ) This was said nearly forty years ago . Begin is dead . And it should be obvious to anybody that if Israel was expansionist , it would have ANNEXED the occupied territories right after it captured them . Israel would not be negotiating to get rid of them . ED > `` During the last 100 years our people have been in a ED > process of building up the country and the nation , of ED > expansion , of getting additional Jews and additional ED > settlements in order to expand the borders here . Let no ED > Jew say that the process has ended . Let no Jew say that ED > we are near the end of the road . '' ED > ( Moshe Dayan , Ma'ariv , 7 July 1968 ) He 's dead , too . And since Israel has not annexed ANY land at all since 1967 , you are once again wasting bandwidth with all of these misleading quotes . They are so out of sync with the reality of Israel , that you do nothing but make yourself look like a fanatic desperate to sway people , by misleading them . ED > `` Let us not today fling accusations at the [ Palestinian ED > Arab ] murderers . Who are we that we should argue ED > against their hatred ?

'' ED > ( Moshe Dayan , eulogy of Roy Rutenberg at Kibbutz Nahal ED > Oz , 1956 , quoted in Uri Avneri , Israel without Zionists , Collier Books , Macmillan , New York , 1971 , p.154 ) Interesting quote . It 's true that we should never lose sight of the plight of these people . We should also recognize that this quote preceded the disgusting wave of Arab terrorism and violence directed at innocent people , that began in 1972 with the massacre of the Israeli athletes in Munich , and continues to this day . If your ability to obscure was the equal of your desire to do so , truthseekers in this group would have a problem . But you are an easily recognized fanatic , whose stream of misleading , partial , and out-of-context quotes are totally unfettered by the burden of truth .

They issued a statement after a three-day Gulf Cooperation Council summit saying Iran had to show proof of its good neighbourly intentions by rescinding measures that `` rocked Gulf stability and security . '' The leaders avoided the anti-Iranian rhetoric of recent statements by Egypt , which engineered a last minute settlement of a border row between Saudi Arabia and Qatar that allowed all members to attend the summit . Egypt said its fears about Iranian intentions in the region and Tehran 's alleged encouragement of Moslem fundamentalist unrest were largely behind President Hosni Mubarak 's mediation . The GCC statement stressed that developing relations between the Gulf Arab states and Iran `` is linked to enhacing confidence and to measures Iran might take in line with its commitment to the principle of good neighbourliness and the respect of the sovreignty and territorial integrity of the region 's states . '' It denounced Iran 's measures on the island of Abu Musa , which it shares with the United Arab Emirates , and the continued occupation of the Greater and Lesser Tumbs islands . Iran earlier this year extended its control over Abu Musa beyond a small garrison it established there in 1971 under an agreement with the UAE emirate of Sharjah . It has since rescinded orders expelling foreigners who worked on the island for the UAE government . But diplomats say it continues to exercise its authority over the whole island , which the UAE sess as as virtual annexation . The Tumbs were occupied by the former Shah of Iran in 1971 and the UAE has since the Abu Musa crisis erupted insisted that they have to be returned as part of a general settlement . The GCC leaders called on the U.N. to maintain sanctions against Iraq for not fully implementing Security Council resolutions following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait . They endorsed once again the `` Damascus Declaration , '' a pact signed with Egypt and Syria after their troops took part in the U.S. led alliance that drove Iraqi troops out of Kuwait . But delegates said the leaders were unable to agree the details of a fund they announced they would create at their last summit in Kuwait last year which would have helped Egypt 's and Syria 's economic development programme . They said the leaders could not agree on a breakdown of contributions from each state although the total amount had been scaled down to $ 6 billion from the $ 10 billion agreed last year . The fact that the leaders of all GCC states -- Saudi Arabia , Bahrain , Kuwait , Oman and Qatar -- attended the summit was seen as a major achievement although their unity was only maintained with outside help . Most delegations were not too worried for the moment about the slow progress of the conservative rulers discussions on a future security structure for the region that boasts the bulk of global oil and gas reserves . The leaders were unable to choose between two proposals . One put forward by a summit committee headed by Oman 's Sultan Qaboos to create a 100,000-man rapid deployment force that could rush to defend any member against external aggression , such as Iraq 's invasion of Kuwait . Another was a Saudi-supported plan to expand the existing 10,000-man '' Peninsula Shield '' force which had so far played a largely symbolic role and is commanded by a Saudi general . Little headway was made on plans for a reginal common market although the summit called for concrete proposals to be submitted to next year 's summit due to be held in Saudi Arabia next December . REUTER YA DYA DJG RTw 12/23 0835 GULF LEADERS END SUMMIT ABU DHABI , Dec 23 , Reuter - Gulf Arab states ended a three-day annual summit on Wednesday with an appeal to Iran to end its occupation of three strategic Gulf islands as a condition for restoring friendly ties across the Gulf . A joint statement issued after the summit , marked by relief over the settlement of a row between two Gulf Cooperation Council members , also called for continued U.N. sanctions against Iraq . It said Baghdad had failed to implement key Security Council decisions following the expulsion of its troops from Kuwait early last year . The summit broke no new ground on steps to achieve a Gulf common market , but called on officials to present a plan for common external tarrifs for all six members to the next summit which will be held in Saudi Arabia in December 1993 . The statement stressed that developing relations between the Gulf Arab states and Iran '' is linked to enhacing confidence and to measures Iran might take in line with its commitment to the principle of good neighbourliness and the respect of the sovreignty and territorial integrity of the region 's states . '' It denounced Iran 's measures on the island of Abu Musa , which it shares with the United Arab Emirates , and the continued occupation of the smaller islands , the Greater and Lesser Tumbs . It expressed deep regret and extreme concern for the unjustified Iranian measures which contradict a proclaimed wish to develop relations and called on Iran to rescind those measures and end the occupation which it said was `` shaking peace and stability in the area . '' Iran earlier this year extended its control over Abu Musa beyond a small garrison it established there in 1971 under an agreement with the UAE emirate of Sharjah . It has since rescinded orders expelling foreigners who worked on the island for the UAE government but diplomats in the region say that its security forces continue to exercise their authority over the whole island . The UAE has seen this as virtual annexation . The Tumbs were occupied by the former Shah of Iran in 1971 and the UAE has since the Abu Musa crisis erupted insisted that they have to be returned as part of a general settlement . REUTER YA DYA DJG RTw 12/26 1441 IRAN HINTS IT READY TO GO TO WAR OVER ISLANDS ( Eds : updates with SNSC statement ) NICOSIA , Dec 26 , Reuter - Iran told its Gulf Arab neighbours on Saturday it was ready to defend militarily three disputed islands , reminding them of its eight-year war with Iraq . `` Our eight-year defence ( in the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war ) has proved to the world that our brave nation will never hesitate to defend the sovereignty and safeguard the territorial integrity of Iran , '' Iran 's Supreme National Security Council ( SNSC ) said . A meeting of the heads of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council voiced full support on Wednesday for the United Arab Emirates ( UAE ) in its dispute with Iran over the Gulf islands of Abu Musa , Greater Tumb and Lesser Tumb . The move has triggered strong Iranian criticism and warnings . Besides the UAE , the GCC also groups Bahrain , Kuwait , Oman , Qatar and Saudi Arabia . Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , who chaired the SNSC's meeting on Saturday , said during his Friday prayer sermon at Tehran University : '' Iran is surely stronger than the likes of you . To reach these islands one has to cross a sea of blood . '' The SNSC , quoted by the official Iranian news agency IRNA received in Cyprus , also criticised the GCC and described its support of the UAE as `` irresponsible . '' `` No country will ever be able to covet even an inch of Iranian soil , '' said the SNSC . Earlier on Saturday , the English language Tehran Times , believed to be close to the Foreign Ministry , said the UAE should be aware that Iran's self-restraint had certain limits . It dismissed a UAE claim to the islands as unfounded and said a 1971 agreement to share Abu Musa with the UAE emirate of Sharjah still applied . `` The idea of Abu Dhabi officials that Tehran would always refrain from responding to the blows inflicted by them was `` childish , '' Tehran Times said . IRNA said the newspaper was commenting on the GCC statement which urged Iran to reverse what it says is the annexation of Abu Musa island and to pull out of the two other islands . Iran says the islands near the entrance to the Gulf have historically belonged to it . The dispute flared this year after Iran tightened its control over Abu Musa . REUTER AF JCH RTw 12/28 1011 TEHRAN PAPER WANTS IRAN REVIVE CLAIM TO BAHRAIN TEHRAN , Dec 28 , Reuter - Radical Iranian newspapers , angered by Gulf Arab claims to three disputed islands , are hitting back with demands that Tehran revive its claim to Bahrain and consider improving ties with Iraq . President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and senior officials strongly condemned a statement last week by leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council ( GCC ) backing the United Arab Emirates ( UAE ) in its dispute with Iran over the Gulf islands . But the newspapers Salam and Jomhuri Eslami demanded that Tehran go further than restating its resolve to defend its sovereignty over the islands of Abu Musa , Greater Tumb and Lesser Tumb . `` It is not very clear why the Sheikh of Bahrain has joined the others , '' Jomhuri Eslami said . The GCC groups Bahrain , Kuwait , Oman , Qatar , Saudi Arabia and the UAE . `` If historical records are to be the criterion , the sheikh of Bahrain should go about his own business and the rule of Iranian people in Bahrain , which belonged to Iran until 1970 , should be re-established , '' the paper said . `` It is fitting for the foreign ministry to raise the question of Iran 's sovereignty over Bahrain ... and start a serious and effective drive to end the separation of Bahrain from Iran , '' it added . The late Shah of Iran relinquished Iran 's claim to Bahrain in 1970 , a year before the island became an independent state . Iranian leaders since the 1979 Islamic revolution have carefully avoided raising the Bahrain issue although it is occasionally brought up in the press during periods of tension with conservative Arab states across the Gulf . Salam newspaper said the GCC stand showed that the policy of appeasing pro-Western Gulf Arab rulers had backfired . `` No matter how much you smile at sheikhs on the southern coast of the Persian Gulf , it is the United States and the West which speak the last word , '' it said . `` They ( the sheikhs ) are nobody , '' Salam said , adding that Iran should revise its policy towards its neighbours , especially its former war enemy Iraq . `` Disregarding the logical potential of expanding ties with Iraq ... and going along with some Saudi-backed trends among the Iraqi opposition have played a role in the formation of the current situation , '' the paper said . Ties between Iran and Iraq , which fought a war from 1980 to 1988 , improved briefly after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990 . But Tehran , which denounced the invasion and remained neutral in the ensuing war , again called for President Saddam Hussein 's overthrow when he suppressed a Shi'ite Moslem revolt which swept southern Iraq after his 1991 defeat in Kuwait .

What is the rule that qualifies > a pitcher as making a save ? IMHO this is the most untrustworthy , silly stat , by today 's rules , in all of baseball . My understanding is to qualify as a save a pitcher can not pitch more than three innings and the potential tying run must at least appear in the on-deck circle . Also , the lead a pitcher enters with can not excede three runs . I believe that the official scorers must assert more of their authority in determining winners/savers/etc . For instance , a pitcher can come in in the ninth with a lead , blow the lead , fall behind , have his team come back in the next half inning and earn the win . Has this pitcher earned a win , no way . I guy could pitch five strong innings of middle relief and see his teammates rally to tie the score . Assume he came in to start the fourth and left after the eighth . His teammate holds the opposition scoreless in the ninth and they score a run in the bottom of the ninth to win . The third pitcher earns the win and the middle reliever gets no `` stat '' satisfaction . Mike I bleed the blue of Dodgers and even like Lasorda spaghetti sauce . >

The Dividians had survived a change in leadership before so even if Koresch himself would have been convicted and sent to jail , they still could have carried on .

From : frank @ marvin.contex.com ( Frank Perdicaro ) Subject : Hawk GT new seat review Keywords : Corbin Lines : 30 Unable to stand the pain anymore , my wife bought the Corbin Gunfighter and Lady with Passenger Backrest for my Hawk GT . It came with no instructions , but it came 2 weeks earlier than they said it would . Installation would have been very easy , but the seat fastening hardware was apparently always on the wrong sides with the stock seat ! It never was easy to put on . Once I figured that out , the new seat went on the first try . The passenger backrest , though , does not fit as I thought it might . The supplied screw to set the backrest angle does not fit , and I have not yet found a suitable , hard , ( SAE grade 8 , or perhaps 5 ) 1/4-20 bolt that fits . There is a a soft bolt in there now -- just do n't lean back . The driver 's section of the seat is a bit wider . Seems comfortable enough , but then again I put about 5000 miles on the stock seat without a thought . The passenger 's section has about 8 times the volume of foam that the stock seat has , and from my short test it seems much more comfortable . The backrest helps a bit , but I 've not has enough time to really test it . The backrest also comes with a small pocket . Its now more difficult to swing my leg up over the 10 '' taller seat . If I go on the three-notch ride soon ( Dixville , Pinkham & Smugglers ) , I 'll give a more complete report , but in general it seems like an improvement . -- Frank Evan Perdicaro Xyvision Color Systems Legalize guns , drugs and cash ... today . 101 Edgewater Drive inhouse : frank @ marvin , x5572 Wakefield MA outhouse : frank @ contex.com , 617-245-4100x5572 018801285

From : aaronc @ athena.mit.edu ( Aaron Bryce Cardenas ) Subject : Baptism requires Faith Organization : Massachusetts Institute of Technology Lines : 144 It troubles me that there have been so many posts recently trying to support the doctrine of Original Sin . This is primarily a Catholic doctrine , with no other purpose than to defend the idea of infant baptism . Even among , its supporters , however , people will stop short of saying that unbaptised infants will go to hell . It 's very easy for just about anyone to come up with a partial list of scripture to support any sort of wrong doctrine . However , if we have the heart to persevere in our beliefs to make sure that they are biblically based , then we can come to an understanding of the truth . Let 's now take a more complete look at scripture . Colossians 2:11-12 `` In him you were also circumcised , in the putting off of the sinful nature , not with a circumcision done by Christ , having been buried with him in baptism and raised with him through your faith in the power of God , who raised him from the dead . '' In baptism , we are raised to a new life in Christ ( Romans 6:4 ) through a personal faith in the power of God . Our parent 's faith can not do this . Do infants have faith ? Let 's look at what the Bible has to say about it . Romans 10:16-17 `` But not all the Israelites accepted the good news . For Isaiah says , 'Lord , who has believed our message ? ' Consequently , faith comes from hearing the message , and the message is heard through the word of Christ . '' So then we receive God 's gift of faith to us as we hear the message of the gospel . Faith is a possible response to hearing God 's word preached . Kids are not yet spiritually , intellectually , or emotionally mature enough to respond to God 's word . Hence they can not have faith and therefore can not be raised in baptism to a new life . Ezekiel 18:20 `` The soul who sins will die . The son will not share the guilt of the father , nor will the father share the guilt of the son . The righteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him , and the wickedness of the wicked will be charged against him . '' If you read all of Ezekiel 18 , you will see that God does n't hold us guilty for anyone else 's sins . So we can have no original guilt from Adam . Ezekiel 18:31-32 `` Rid yourselves of all the offenses you have committted , and get a new heart and a new spirit . Why will you die , O house of Israel ? For I take no pleasure in the death of anyone , declares the Sovereign Lord . Repent and live ! '' The way to please God is to repent and get a new heart and spirit . Kids can not do this . Acts 2:38-39 says that when we repent and are baptized , we will then receive a new spirit , the Holy Spirit . Then we shall live . Now then that we have a little more background as to why original sin is not Biblical , let 's look at some of the scriptures used to support it . Romans 5:12 `` Therefore , just as sin entered the world through one man , and death through sin , and in this way death came to all men , because all sinned -- '' Sin and death entered the world when the first man sinned . Death came to each man because each man sinned . Note that it 's good to read through all of Romans 5:12-21 . Some of the verses are easier to misunderstand than others , but if we read them in context we will see that they are all saying basically the same thing . Let 's look at one such . Romans 5:19 `` For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners , so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous . '' Through the disobedience of each individual , each was made a sinner . In the same way , through the obedience of Jesus , each will be made righteous . We must remember when reading through this passage that death came to each man only because each man sinned , not because of guilt from Adam . Otherwise the Bible would contradict itself . I encourage you to read through this whole passage on your own , looking at it from this point of view to see if it does n't all fit together . Psalm 51:5 `` Surely I was sinful at birth , sinful from the time my mother conceived me . '' This whole Psalm is a wonderful example of how we should humble ourselves before God in repentance for sinning . David himself was a man after God's own heart and wrote the Psalm after committing adultry with Bathsheba and murdering her husband . All that David is saying here is that he can't remember a time when he was n't sinful . He is humbling himself before God by confessing his sinfulness . His saying that he was sinful at birth is a hyperbole . The Bible , being inspired by God , is n't limited to a literal interpetation , but also uses figures of speech as did Jesus ( John 16:25 ) . For another example of hyperbole , see Luke 14:26 . Now then , even though people see that baptism requires faith and that original sin is not Biblical , they will still argue that infant baptism is necessary because children sin by being selfish - not sharing toys with other children , by being mean - hitting others and fighting , etc . Certainly we have observed children doing wrong things , but my gut feeling is always that they do n't know any better . Let 's look to see if the Bible agrees with my gut feelings . Isaiah 7:14-15 `` Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign : The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son , and will call him Immanuel . He will eat curds and honey when he knows enough to reject the wrong and choose the right . '' Now just about any church leader will tell you that this is a prophecy about Jesus . If they do n't , then point them to Matthew 1:23 and find a new leader . Jesus certainly could n't have had less knowledge than normal human babies . Yet this passage says that he had to mature to a certain extent before he would know the difference between right and wrong . We see that he did grow and become wiser in Luke 2:40 and 2:52 . The implication is that Jesus did wrong things as a child before he knew to choose right over wrong . Since we know that Jesus was perfect -- without sin , we have rather conclusive proof that babies can not sin because they do n't know to choose the right instead of the wrong . Jesus himself was baptized , albeit with John 's baptism , not as an infant , but as a thirty-year-old man ( Luke 3:21-23 ) and started his ministry as soon as he was baptized ( Luke 3:23 ) . Immediately afterwards , he was tempted by the devil ( Luke 4:1-13 ; Matthew 4:1-11 ; Mark 1:12-13 ) . Thank you for your attention . Moderator - this should finish up the subject for a while . Perhaps you would like to make a FAQ out of this response so that you can repost it from time to time when the topic comes up . Feel free to rearrange the contents if you would like to , but please send me a copy of the final FAQ . Sincerely , Aaron Cardenas aaronc @ athena.mit.edu [ I think you 're overly optimistic about the authoritative quality of your response . First , original sin is not a Catholic-only doctrine . It was held by Luther and Calvin as well , and is still present in one form or another in the Lutheran and Reformed traditions . Second , saying that it has no other purpose than defending infant baptism is an ad hominem argument , which has considerable evidence against it . The original Baptist theology included original sin , and some Baptists still hold it . And there are certainly groups that baptize infants without believing in original sin . Among Protestants , the sacraments tend to be a bit more symbolic than among Catholics . Protestants who baptize infants see baptism as a sign of God 's acceptance of us , rather than our acceptance of God . In traditional Protestant theology , God 's grace precedes our response , and is applicable to children . There are a number of passages one can cite to indicate that God accepts even children . -- clh ]

In an increasingly litigation mad society , this trap is becoming exceedingly difficult to avoid . With the infusion and strengthening of ethnic cultures in American ( and Australian , to bring in my local perspective ) culture the boundaries of acceptable behaviour are ever widening and legislation may eventually become the definition of moral behaviour . For instance , some cultures ' dominant religion call for live sacrifice of domesticated animals . Most fundamental christians would find this practice abhorrent . However , is it moral , according to the multicultural american society ? This kind of problem may only be definable by legislation . Obviously within any society there will be differences in opinion in what is acceptable behaviour or not , and much of this will be due to different environmental circumstances rather than merely different opinions . One thing is for sure , there is no universal moral code which will suit all cultures in all situations . There may , however , be some globally accepted mores which can be agreed upon and instantiated as a globally enforcable concept . The majority of mores will not be common until all peoples upon this earth are living in a similar environment ( if that ever happens ) . Jeff 'Nonickname ' Clark .

From : banschbach @ vms.ocom.okstate.edu Subject : Vitamin A and Infection Lines : 217 Nntp-Posting-Host : vms.ocom.okstate.edu Organization : OSU College of Osteopathic Medicine I 've sent Gordon R. my posts on protein , vitamin C and vitamin A prior to posting on internet as a professional courtesy . Somehow I 've managed to delete my vitamin A post from my text file . Gordon R. had promised to send it back to me but he 's pretty mad at me right now so I 'll just retype it . Since digging through all my references is very time consuming ( took me all day for that PMS post ) , I 'm not going to cite any references ( Gordon R. has them ) . I 'm going to include some of the material from Weinsier and Morgan 's new Nutrition textbook ( which was not in my original material ) to point out that what I 'm going to say has some support in the medical community . Diet has been know to affect the immune system of man for a very , very long time . Protein has always had the biggest role in infection and I 've already covered the role of protein in protecting you against infection . Now I 'm going to hit what I consider to be the most important nutrient in the U.S. as far as infection is concerned ( vitamin A ) . When vitamin A was originally discovered , it was commonly referred to as the anti-infection vitamin . Many people ( Linus Pauling being one ) have decided to take this title away from vitamin A and give it to vitamin C ( which I 've already covered ) . Big mistake ( in my opinion ) . Vitamin A is also getting a reputation as an anti-cancer vitamin ( with good reason ) . The NCI currently has numerous clinical trials in progress to see if vitamin A can not only prevent cancer but cure it as well . It 's role in both cancer and infection is almost identical ( but not quite ) . Vitamin A comes in two completely different forms ( retinol and beta-carotene ) . Retinol is the animal form and it 's toxic , beta-carotene is the plant form and it 's completely nontoxic . Both retinol and beta- carotene display good absorption in the human gut if bile is present ( 60-80 % ) . The liver stores all of your retinol and doles it out for other tissues to use by synthesizing retinol binding protein ( RBP ) . A normal human adult liver should have 500,000IU to 1,000,000IU of retinol stored . We are born with 10,000IU in our liver . U.S. autopsy has shown that about 30 % of Americans die with the same ( or less ) amount of vitamin A as they were born with . If you do n't believe that nutritional reserves ( like that of retinol in the liver ) are important , then this low vitamin A reserve is not going to affect you . But if you believe ( like I do ) that the nutrient reserves are important , then there is a problem with vitamin A in the U.S . The U.S. RDA for vitamin A in an adult male is 1,000 RE or 5,000IU of vitamin A . For adult feamles its 800 RE or 4,000IU of vitamin A . Diet surveys show that most Americans are getting this amount of vitamin A ( either retinol or Beta-carotene ) from their diet . But the NRC ( National Research Council ) was going to release a new RDA table in 1985 that had the RDA for both vitamin A and vitamin C raised ( C to 90mg per day and A to 7,500IU per day for adult males ) . That report and it 's recommendations was killed . Why ? Concern over the increasing supplementation was the main reason . RDAs are set to prevent clinical disease , not to keep nutrient reserves full . Many scientist in the U.S. feel that the time has come to move away from the prevention of clinical pathology concept and move towards the promotion of optimum health concept , especially since we have some very good data now that show that nutrient reserves are extremely important during periods of stress . The nutritonal concervatives won that battle and a new group of scientist were collected to come out with the 1989 RDA list which lowered the RDA for several nutrients and moved the dietary guidelines back to where they were when we first started in the 1940 's ( get enough to prevent clinical pathology , but not enough to fill the reserves ) . We know from autopsy that only about 10 % of Americans have a liver with a normal vitamin A reserve ( 500,000IU to 1,000,000IU ) . I preach nutrient reserves to my students and tell them to measure them in their patients . But for vitamin A , only a liver biopsy ( or autopsy data ) will tell you how much somebody has stored . We can tell very easily if someone has overfilled his or her liver with vitamin A by measuring the serium retinol level ( levels above 450ug/dl are highly suggestive that you have filled your liver with vitamin A and it 's time to stop taking retinol ) . The normal range of serum retinol will be 20-100ug/dl . Hypervitaminosis A is diagnosed with a serum retinol level of 2,000ug/dl or higher ( Interpretation of Diagnostic Test , Wallach , M.D. , a Little Brown Series book ) . This level of vitamin A in blood means that medical attention is necessary due to vitamin A toxicity . Weinsier and Morgan take a much more conservative approach to vitamin A toxicity than does Wallach , as you will see later in this post . Between 450ug/dl and 2,000ug/dl you should have plenty of warning that it 's time to eliminate the retinol from your diet ( headache , redness of the skin , hair loss , joint pain ) . I tell all my students that will use vitamin A in their practice that they had better monitor the serum retinol level and stop when there are clear signs that the liver is full . You will never really know if the patient needs the vitamin A ( because you can not measure the pool in liver ) but you will always know when it 's time to stop ( just like in those vitamin A for PMS studies ) . Beta-carotene can be taken to fill up your liver with retinol and you will never have to worry about toxicity because the conversion of beta-carotene to retinol that occurs in both your gut and your liver will slow down ( stops in the liver and slows down in the gut ) when your liver is full of retinol . But taking Beta-carotene as the source of retinol takes a very long time to fill the liver up ( I 've seen estimates of 20-30 years ) if you are in the 30 % that only has as much as you were born with in your liver ( 10,000IU ) . One other problem with beta-carotene , if you have a zinc deficit , you will not convert as much beta-carotene to retinol in the gut or the liver because the enxzyme that does this conversion requires zinc . In addition , the release of retinol from the liver is a zinc dependent process so a zinc deficit will cause a vitamin A deficit even if your liver has plenty of vitamin A . Now what does vitamin A do in cancer and infection protection ? The body uses vitamin A ( retinol ) for many different things . Vision ( the first to be nailed down and where you see overt clinical pathology ) uses the aldehyde ( retinal ) and alcohol ( retinol ) form of vitamin A. Reproduction uses the retinol form and some retinal . Infection and cancer protection uses retinoic acid . How do you convert retinol ( which your white blood cells and the mucosal cells get from blood ) to retinoic acid ? You use enzymes , one of which requires vitamin C ( this is why Pauling has tried to pull the title of anti-infection vitamin away from vitamin A ) . Vitamin C does play a role in infection ( interferon production for example ) but it 's biggest role is the conversion of retinol to retinoic acid . If you increase your intake of vitamin C , you will increase your formation of retinoic acid . But retinoic acid can not be converted back to retinol ( as retinal can ) and once it 's formed , it 's used and then lost to the body . This is why the 1985 NRC group wanted to increase both vitamin C and vitamin A RDA 's . Most people taking large amounts of vitamin C really think that they are helping themselves . If they do n't have much vitamin A in their liver and they are not also increasing their intake of vitamin A , they actually do themselves more harm than good . Retinoic acid functions in white blood cells to promote antibody formation . In the mucus membrane , it is the main factor in promoting good mucus production and a good epithelial cell barrier to prevent infectious agents from entering the blood system . The mucus membrane is referred to as the `` first line '' defense against infection . For cancer , retinoic acid has been shown to act as a cell brake ( it counteracts the effect of cell promoters which stimulate cells to divide ) . Cancer has two distinct steps , DNA alteration and cell promotion . For cells that normally divide all the time , promoters are not that important . But for lung and breast tissue which does not normally divide , promoters are real important in the malignant process . This is the major reason why the NCI has so many different clinical trials in progress using retinol and/or beta-carotene . Chronic infection ( irritation ) of the mucus membranes is a signal that vitamin A may not be adequate . I tell my students that any patient who walks into their office with a complaint of chronic infection has to be worked up for vitamin A ( along with the other factors that medicine already has on it 's list of causes for chronic infection ) . I drive this home in my course at the Osteopathic College in Tulsa , when I teach at the allopathic medical school in Tulsa ( OU 's branch campus ) and when I give CME lectures . Dark adaptation is the best clinical test for vitamin A status since night vision is impacted when liver reverves drop to 50,000IU of retinol . The serum level of retinol can also be used , but it does not drop until liver reserves drop below 10,000 to 20,000IU . Asking a patient if they have trouble seeing at night is a good initial screen ( if cataracts are ruled out ) . In one study done on U.S. Spanish-Americans where serum retinol levels were measured , 25 % of the sample population had a serum retinol level below 20ug/dl . As more studies are done on serum retinol levels in population groups of the U.S. that have had a history of high infection rates , we will probably see a much stonger correlation between infection incidence rates and low serum retinol levels . What do Weinsier and Morgan have to say about vitamin A ? Here are excerpts from their book : Vitamin A functions in vision in the forrm of retinol , it is necessay for growth and differentation of epithelial tissue , and is required for reproduction , embryonic development , and bone growth . Protein-calorie malnutrition and zinc deficiency may impair the absorption , transport , and metabolism of vitamin A. Retinaldehyde is converted to retinoic acid , which has biological activity in growth and in cell diferentiation but not in reproduction or vision . The most common procedure to evaluate vitamin A status is to measure the retinol level in plasma or serum . The normal range for vitamin A content for a child is 20 to 90ug/dl . Lower values are indicators of deficiency or depleted body stores . Serum levels greater than 100ug/dl are indicative of toxic levels of vitamin A . Dark adaptation tests and electroretinogram measurements are also useful but difficult to perform on young children . Rapidly proliferating tissues are sensitive to vitamin A deficiency and may revert to an undifferentiated state . The bronchorespiratory tract , skin , genitourinary system , gastrointestinal tract and sweat glands are adversely affected . A daily intake of more than 7.5mg ( about 37,000IU ) of retinol is not advised and chronic use of amounts over 20mg ( 100,000IU ) can result in a dry and itching skin , desquamation , erythematous dermatitis , hair loss , joint pain , chapped lips , hyperostois ( bony depositis ) , headaches , anorexia , edema and fatigue . They recommend 30mg of retinol via IM injection in children for vitamin A deficiency but do not discuss treatment for adults . Their toxic serum retinol level is very conservative . I recommend that my students try 25,000IU in adults that are having problems with chronic infection . They have to rule out a zinc deficit first by getting an RBC zinc run ( or if their clinical lab ca n't run it , I tell them to do what Weinsier and Morgan suggest , give them the zinc along with the vitamin A . At 25,000IU per day , toxicity should not be a problem and you will not have to worry about pulling the patient into the office on a regular basis to run a serum retinol . Both Elaine and Jon found doctors who used a much higher dose of vitamin A . Recall that the PMS papers were using 100,000IU to 200,000IU of vitamin A. I do n't suggest that my students use these high doses . If you wanted to fill the liver up fast ( as part of a clinical trial ) and were monitoring the serum retinol level , then you would be okay . But my knowledge of the vitamin A literature suggests to me that 25,000IU for patients with a demonstrated vitamin A deficit ( dark adapatation test or serum retinol ) will provide a good and steady improvement ( as long as zinc and vitamin C status are good ) without having to worry about toxicity . If they want to get more agressive , fine if they follow my advise to check the serum retinol . But vitamin A ( retinol ) should never be given in high dose to women who could become pregnant since vitamin A shows teratogenicity towards the human fetus . The dose needed to show this effect on the developing fetus is 18,000IU of retinol per day . Beta-carotene will never have this effect on the human fetus . Could just taking Beta-carotene instead of retinol supplements help ? Yes but the effect will take a long time to develop . My advise is to use retinol to fill the liver up and then switch to beta-carotene to keep it full . Vitamin A is probably one nutrient that is better off left to prescription by doctors . But when we have the M.D . 's in this newsgroup jumping all over me and other doctors that propose the use of vitamin A supplements for treating patients with chronic sinus and GI distress , I think that the most prudent option is to keep vitamin A in the OTC market but require manufactors to provide package inserts to educate the general public about the dangers of vitamin A supplementation .

For many reasons , it can , and we here on the front lines see no reason why it should not . The 'spaceport political publicity' referred to the other day had its intended effect - the state of New Mexico did establish the start of the necessary government infrastructure to back a commercial space port . The commanding general at WSMR is in full support of dual-use for the facilities . The WSMR location also has some strategic advantages in the form of necessary infrastructure and controlled air space to support the project . Just because the folks involved have not done the traditional aerospace-equivalent of vapor-ware by inviting folks out to kick non-existent tires but have been merely doing their job to prepare for launch , do n't think that nothing has happened . From my interactions with the MACDAC folks , I get the impression that they want to set a firm , believable launch date based on vehicle readiness and not just some fiction to plug a space on a calendar . I believe that all will happen this summer and do n't worry , the locals here are planning to let everyone know when it does occur . Stephen Horan shoran @ nmsu.edu

From : J.K.Wight @ newcastle.ac.UK ( Jim Wight ) Subject : aXe 5.0 is available Organization : The Internet Lines : 89 Reply-To : J.K.Wight @ newcastle.ac.uk NNTP-Posting-Host : enterpoop.mit.edu To : xpert @ expo.lcs.mit.edu I have placed a new release of my aXe editor in aXe-5.0.tar.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu ( 18.24.0.12 ) and arjuna.ncl.ac.uk ( 128.240.150.1 ) . The significant change this time , and the justification for the hike in the major version number , is : o undo has been implemented . By default only the last change can be undone , but a resource is provided to allow the user to specify how many , including unlimited , levels of undo information should be kept . Also , undo of undo is supported . There is no truth in the rumour that the next version will be EmaXe 19 : - ) -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- For those who have not encountered aXe before here is a summary of what it is all about : aXe is a simple to use text editor for X that represents a significant improvement over xedit . Also built around the Athena Text Widget it features , amongst other things , o multiple windows o multiple buffers o default menu interface o optional button interface , with choice and layout of buttons under user control o minibuffer for expert use and access to external filters o provision for defining a keyboard macro o geometry specification and resizing in terms of characters o file selection via a browser o knowledge of line numbers o parenthesis matching o regular expression searching o restricted or unlimited undo o ability to change font o easy entry of control codes o xterm-like keymap feature o easy runtime setting of selected preferences ( resources ) o both brief and comprehensive on-line help o server mode with cooperating client programs o optional extension language using Tcl o optional Xaw3d widget set compatability o collection of reusable widgets that embody the functionality of aXe I have personally built and run core aXe , i.e . without the Tcl and Xaw3d options , on the following systems : Sun SPARC SunOS 4.1.x MIT X11R5 Sun SPARC SunOS 5.1 MIT X11R5 Encore Multimax UMAX 4.3 MIT X11R5 DEC 5000/120 ULTRIX 4.2 MIT X11R5 HP 9000/710 HP-UX 8.07 MIT X11R5 MAC IIci AU/X 3.0 MIT X11R5 but not all have been subject to the same level of testing . I have only tested the Tcl and Xaw3d options on the first . A number of ' # ifdef SYSV'-isms that have been fed back to me have been incorporated into the code and a possible scandir replacement is provided for those systems that do not have one . Although aXe will probably build under R4 run-time problems have been encountered in the past . I have not bothered to try this version under R4 , and have not put any effort into solving previously known problems . Therefore , if you are at R4 you very much take pot luck . If it does n't work the only alternative is to try the last release , 2.1.1 , of version 2 which should still be around . It does n't have as many features and uses the Widget Creation Library ( Wcl ) . Not only that , it requires an old version of Wcl , 1.06 or 1.05 . Version 3 of aXe was nearing completion when version 2 of Wcl came out so aXe 2 never got converted to make use of it . aXe is available by anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu ( 18.24.0.12 ) and arjuna.ncl.ac.uk ( 128.240.150.1 ) initially , and probably in due course from several other ftp sites .

Message-ID : < 25APR199316225142 @ fsphy1.physics.fsu.edu > Organization : Florida State University - School of Higher Thought News-Software : VAX/VMS VNEWS 1.4-b1 First , I 'm sorry to hear that you have had to see your grandmother go through this . I know it has to have been tough . There are many things that can cause long term confusion in elderly adults . The change in environment can cause problems . Anesthetic agents can cause confusion because the body can not clear the medicines out of the body as easily . In addition , medications and interactions between medications can cause confusion . As far as whether or not haldol can have long lasting effects even after the drug has been discontinued , I do not know . I have not _seen_ anything to that effect . However , I also had not been looking for that information . I can see what I can find ... I can tell you that haldol is an antipsychotic drug , and , according to the Nursing93 Drug handbook , it is `` Especially useful for agitation associated with senile dementia '' ( p. 400 ) . It also should not be discontinued abruptly . It did not say anything about long lasting effects . Because so many things can cause confusion , it is hard for me to know what else was going on at the time ; if I had more history , i might be able to answer you better . If you want to send me e-mail with more information , I would be happy to try to help you piece together what might have happened . Elisa picl25 @ fsphy1.physics.fsu.edu

So how much mass is saved by not burning the OMS ? That 's the critical question . My data shows that the OMS engines hold 10,900 kg of propellant .

First , while astronauts certainly have done EVAs with minimal planning , that was because they _had_ to . They do n't like to do that as a general rule . Second , remember why they had to improvise during Intelsat 6 ? They were trying to attach a motor to a piece of hardware that was n't designed to do that . Trying to shortcut the training is only going to make a repeat more likely . Third , they do n't have eight months .

From what I 've seen in coursework , most CPUs never actually '' idle '' . They will continue to service interrupts , etc. , etc . The clock will always be running at n Mhz no matter what it 's doing . I suppose depending on the instruction , the CPU may use circuitry which has more transistors than other instructions , but if you consider the additional heat generated by only a handful of additional , tiny resistors and then spread that heat dissipation over the CPU's packaging , the change in temperature to the immediate environment ( ie . the surface of the package ) will be negligible .

What if you had an authorization key that computed from the name and address data . When the user registers , you do n't even need to send executable code , just compute his/her key and send him/her instructions to enter in the appropriate place the following : Name=Joe Doe Address=123 Main Street City=Anytown , CA key=ldslfoialsdkcdsngsikhsfd Every user needs a unique key . The executable can propagate as much as you like , the author can respond to the registration by e-mail , post card , whatever . Unauthorized users would have to put up with someone else 's name showing up ( maybe on a main menu screen as well as a startup message ) . Authorized users can make as many copies as they like , upgrade their machines , whatever .

The teacher of the class is what I consider to be closed-minded and bigotted on the subject of what the definition of Christianity is . His definition is tied directly to that of the Trinity and the Catholic church 's definition of it and belief in Jesus Christ is not sufficient to call one 's self a Christian . While his saying it does n't make it so , I nevertheless feel insulted ( or am I just neurotic ? : ^ ) ) . I would like to be able to respond to him with some sense of literacy while maintaining an amiable student-teacher relationship . So , is there common definition of what Christianity is ?

This would include any group that developed out of the Christian church , and continues within the same broad culture . E.g . some Unitarians would fail just about any doctrinal test you could come up with . Yet it 's clear that that group developed from Christianity , and people from very different backgrounds ( e.g . Hindus ) would likely see them as part of Christianity . This is not a definition most Christians like , but it's relevant in some political and ethnic contexts . 2 ) Accepting Christ as Lord and savior is a test used by many Christian groups for membership , e.g . the Southern Baptists and Presbyterian Church ( USA ) . I would qualify it by saying that what most people have in mind is an exclusive commitment to Christ , so that someone who accepted Christ as one of many gods would not fit . It's an attempt to formulate a criterion that is religious but is not based on technical doctrine . By this definition , groups such as Arians would be viewed as heretical Christians , but still Christians . In the modern context this would include Mormons , JW 's , and `` oneness Pentecostals '' . They would be viewed as heretical Christians , but still Christian . In practice I believe just about everyone who falls into this category would accept the Apostle 's Creed . 3 ) The next level is an attempt to give a broad doctrinal definition , which includes all of the major strands of Christianity , but excludes groups that are felt to be outside `` historic Christianity . '' This is of course a slippery enterprise , since Catholics could argue that Protestants are outside historic Christianity , etc . But I think the most commonly accepted definition would be based on something like the Nicene Creed and the Formula of Chalcedon . The attempt is to characterize doctrines that all major strands of Christianity agree are key . Obviously this is to some extent a matter of judgement . A Mormon will regard the LDS church as a major strand , and thus will not want to include anything that contradicts their beliefs . But I think this definition would have fairly broad acceptance . 4 ) Finally , some people use definitions that I would say are limited to a specific Christian tradition . E.g . some evangelicals only consider someone Christian if he has had an evangelical-style conversion experience , and some I 've even heard of groups that limit it to their specific church . I think you can find contexts where each of these definitions is used . A lot is going to depend upon the purpose you 're using it for . If you 're using it descriptively , e.g . in history or anthropology , you'll probably use definition 1 or 2 . If you 're using it normatively , i.e . to say what you believe the Christian message is , you 'll probably use a definition like 3 or even 4 . -- clh ]

Your paragraph above seems to indicate there might be . The OED gives the etymology of `` sibyl '' as coming from the ancient Greek sigma iota beta upsilon lambda lambda alpha ( S i b ih l l a ) which is claimed to come from the Doric sigma iota omicron beta upsilon lambda lambda alpha ( s i o b ih l l a ) which ( if I read it properly ) in turn came from the Attican ( Athenian ) theta epsilon omicron beta omicron upsilon lambda eta ( th eh o b o ih l ae ) I do n't know much about Attis , but it would n't surprise me to learn that this God was tied to the Athenian capital Alpha tau tau iota kappa upsilon sigma ( a t t i k u s ) The OED does not list any etymology for `` Cybele '' since that is a propper noun , but I suggest that the Greek spelling of that word would be much closer to the anticedants of Sibyl than the two words are now . Perhaps `` Cybele '' is a French or Latin spelling ?

There was little involvement of federal funds , or except through support of state universities , of state funds , for scientific research before WWII . The US research position had been growing steadily , and the funding was mainly from university and private foundation funds . There were not that many research universities , but they all provided their researchers with low teaching loads , laboratories , assistants , and equipment , and funds for travel to scientific meetings . Not that much , but it was provided , and a university wishing to get a scholar had to consider research funding as well as salary . During WWII , the military and the defense departments found that pure scientists could do quite well with their problems , even though they were not exactly in the areas of the scientists ' expertise . This is probably because of the `` research mind '' approach , which is not to try to find a solution , but to understand the problem and see if a solution emerges . This works in stages , and as research scientists were used to discussion about their problems , the job got done . The military realized the importance of maintaining scientists for the future , and started funding pure research after WWII . But Congress was unwilling to have military funds diverted into this investment into the future supply of scientists , and set up other organizations , such as NSF , to do the job . It also set up an elaborate procedure to supposedly keep politics out . Also , the government did a job on private foundations , making it more difficult for them to act to support research . The worst part of the federal involvement is that in those areas in which the government supports research the university will not provide funding , and in fact expects its scholars to bring in net government money . Suppose , as has been the case , I have a project which could use the assistance of a graduate student for a few months . What do you think happens if I ask for one ? The answer I will get is , `` Get the money from NSF . '' Now the money at the university level is a few thousand , but at the NSF level it comes to about 20 thousand , and is likely to keep a faculty member from getting supported . So the government is , in effect , deciding which projects get supported , and how much . Also , the government decided that the `` wealth '' should be spread . So instead of having a moderate number of universities which were primarily research institutions , the idea that more schools should get into the act came into being . And instead of evaluating scholars , they had to go to evaluating reseach proposals . As a researcher , I can tell you that any research proposal has to be mainly wishful thinking , or as now happens , the investigator conceals already done work to release it as the results of the research . What I am proposing today I may solve before the funding is granted , I may find impossible , or I may find that it is too difficult . In addition , tomorrow I may get unexpected research results . Possibly I may bet a bright idea which solves yesterday 's too difficult problem , or a whole new approach to something I had not considered can develop . This is the nature of the beast , and except for really vague statements , if something can be predicted , it is not major research , but development or routine activity not requiring more than minimal attention of a good researcher . I believe that at this time less quality research is being done than would have happened if the government had never gotten into it , and the government is trying to divert researchers from thinkers to plodders . -- Herman Rubin , Dept . of Statistics , Purdue Univ. , West Lafayette IN47907-1399 Phone : ( 317 ) 494-6054 hrubin @ snap.stat.purdue.edu ( Internet , bitnet ) { purdue , pur-ee } ! snap.stat ! hrubin ( UUCP )

It is tempting ( albeit chauvinistic ) to believe that we have a new situation here , thanks to our pet computers . This is not true . David Kahn 's `` The Codebreakers '' , a history of cryptography , makes two things obvious : 1 . Cryptography is a spontaneous invention of private human individuals and has been going on for thousands of years . [ Teen-age slang and cipher inventions provide a modern example of this spontaneous creation . ] 2 .

From : cfaks @ ux1.cts.eiu.edu ( Alice Sanders ) Subject : Re : Kidney Stones Organization : Eastern Illinois University Lines : 32 A student told me today that she has been diagnosed with kidney stones , a cyst on one kidney , and a kidney infection . She was upset because her condition had been misdiagnosed since last fall , and she has been ill all this time . During her most recent doctor 's appointment at her parents' HMO clinic , she said that about FORTY ! x-rays were made of her kidney . When she asked why so many x-rays were being made , she was told by a technician that they need to see the area from different views , but she says that about five x-rays were made from EACH angle . She could n't help feeling that something must be wrong with the procedure or something . She is a pre-med student and feels she could have understood what was happening if someone would have explained . When nobody would , she got worried . Also , she is told that thre are 300 ! surgery patients ahead of her and that they can not do surgery until August or so . It is now April ... She is supposed to rest a lot and drink fluids . But she has to go to classes . She wonders why they have given her no medicine . She plans to call back her doctor 's office / clinic and try to get answers to these questions . But I told her I would also write in to sci.med and see what I could find out about why there were so many x-rays and whether it seems o.k . to wait in line 3 or more months for surgery for something like this or whether she should be looking elsewhere for her care . She does plan to get a second opinion , too . I will pass info on to her . It never hurts to get information from more than one source . You can e-mail me or post . Thanks . Alice

I 've often contemplated putting the boot in said dog 's muzzle as I open the throttle , but have never tried that . I figgure the impact would unballance me and I 'd dump the bike . A bicycling technique I've employed was to use my frame mounted tire pump to fend off dog attacks . On one occasion I was attacked by a pack of four dogs at once while peddaling up a steep hill . I lost my right sock , but no blood . I complained to the local Animal Control department ( after complaining to the owner of the dogs to no affect ) about the dogs ; no more dogs , no more attacks . The telephone worked much better than the tire pump . Eric Bong DoD # 0270 1986 FZ750 1987 FZR750 1991 VFR750
From : cathy @ LANCE.ColoState.Edu ( Cathy Smith ) Subject : THE LIES OF TEXAS -- L. Neil Smith Nntp-Posting-Host : blanca.lance.colostate.edu Organization : Colorado State University , Fort Collins , CO 80523 Lines : 108 Posted for L. Neil Smith by Cathy Smith THE LIES OF TEXAS Okay , what have we learned ? For reasons still being kept secret , a federal agency already known -- well enough to be examined and rebuked by several legislative committees over the years -- for a longstanding , violent disregard of the law , invades the home of a man whose religious beliefs and personal habits they abominate , violating his rights under the First , Second , Fourth , Fifth , Ninth , and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution . The man and his followers fight back , killing four of the outlaw agency 's minions , wounding many more , and suffering their own losses in the process . The agency responds by cutting off his electricity , water , and especially his contact with the outside world . They are then free to say anything at all about him -- in pronouncements that contradict one another daily as the agency finds itself locked in a bitter power struggle with another outfit eager to gain credit for `` straightening out the mess '' -- and , more importantly , to script his side of the subsequent `` negotiations '' any way they please . The impasse lasts almost two months , ironically , at the same time four L.A. cops are being given a second trial for brutalizing a single individual , sparking one of the ugliest riots in history . Armored vehicles surround the house , already ringed with snipers using scoped , high-powered rifles . Loudspeakers playing obnoxious records at the highest possible volume , and searchlights , deprive those in the house of sleep ( in the aftermath , nobody in authority will mention the effect this technique , originated by North Korean Communists as a battle tactic , may have had on their judgment ) . Finally -- another irony -- on the 50th anniversary of the rising of the Warsaw Ghetto , some of the armor punches holes in the house and gas of some kind is injected . The house bursts into flame and is reduced to ashes in less than an hour . At least 80 lives , including those of more than a dozen children , are snuffed out . Spokesmen for the outlaw agencies , the Attorney General , and the President all hold press conferences to articulate a common theme : blame the victim . He had illegal weapons -- as soon as they can be prepared in a secret government workshop and planted among the cinders being '' examined '' by the agency that created them . He was abusing children -- the tapes will be stored with the data on the JFK assassination . He set the fire -- our snipers saw him doing it . Film at 11 -- in 3000 A.D . He shot his followers who tried to escape -- or was that Jim Jones ? Best of all , he 's dead -- he ca n't say a damn thing to embarrass us , any more than when his contact with the world was severed at the start of the whole travesty . A leading national paper claims 93 % of the American people believe that a man who resisted a savage attack on his home is somehow responsible for everything that resulted . But when did you ever know 93 % of Americans to agree on anything -- does n't this sound more like the outcome of a Soviet election than an opinion poll ? Very well , what can we infer from the above ? For starters , never forget that , although Democratic careers are on the line ( and rightfully so ) over this fiasco , by the outlaw agency 's admission , it was planned and rehearsed by a Republican administration . Which may explain why Paul Harvey , who evidently used up all his courage and integrity changing his mind ( at about the same time I did ) about the war in Viet Nam -- has been acting as little more than a mouthpiece for a state that has no regard for the Bill of Rights . More importantly , when Rush Limbaugh , who 's been a quivering tower of Jello during the whole thing , takes essentially the same stance as Bill Clinton , it 's time for fundamental changes , if not in the system , then at least within yourself . On March 5 , back at the beginning , Mary Gingell , national chair of the Libertarian Party , issued a press release condemning the outlaw agency and calling for its abolition . In fact , the LP has promised in its platform since 1977 , for at least 16 years , to abolish both agencies involved in Waco . I 'm proud to say I was there and helped to write that plank . True , the LP is tiny and insignificant ( although less so than in 1977 -- ask the Democrats in Georgia if you doubt it ) . But , alone in a howling wilderness of fascists scrambling now to cover their behinds with phony polls and Big Lies , the LP is right about what happened in Waco . And if their advice had been followed in 1977 , Waco never would have happened . Think about it . And think about the fact that , if you 've had enough of political parties more interested in collecting and holding power -- at whatever cost to the Bill of Rights , let alone human life -- than in defending and expanding individual liberty , maybe the change it 's time for within yourself is to make the LP less tiny and insignificant by a single voice and a single vote .

Ferget it . Actually , a WERA racer , William Lumsden , considered running a Vmax in A Superstock . He took it out to Talladega GPR for a practice day , and _really_ annoyed the 600 riders -- they usually got caught behind a sideways Vmax in the corners , and if they passed him going in , he'd blow by down the straight ( usually wobbling ) . Needless to say , since he was 2 seconds faster on a 1977 CB400F , he decided against the Vmax .

I 'd assume easier , > since we 're removing particulate matter instead of converting > gasses . Let 's hear people 's opinions ... The technology Cummins is applying to diesels to comply with the newer Ca . emissions laws involves three things I know of : 1 . All compliant diesels are turbocharged . 2 . All use an `` aftercooler '' , which cools the air which was heated by compression by the turbocharger ( up to about 25 PSI ) . 3 . A gismo on the injector pump which senses the pressurized air intake , and limits full delivery of fuel while the pressure is low . No scrubbers , catalytic converters , etc , are used . The path from the turbocharger to the exhaust outlet is kept very free . Interestingly , except for the low-pressure fuel limitation , power output and mileage are enhanced by these measures . One can buy aftermarket turbos and aftercoolers which generate more power , lots more power , and these are approved by the CARB . Dan Hepner

'' I have n't read enough of either to comment , although > everyone tells me I should read Nietzche . I would have to say that the `` greatest philosopher '' title would have to go to Plato since the whole enterprise of philosophy was essentially defined by him . Although he got most of his answers wrong , he did definitively identify what the important questions are . I think it was Descartes who said that `` All philosophy is just a footnote to Plato . '' If I were to choose which philosopher made the most important advances in human knowledge over his lifetime , that 's simple ... it is Aristotle . This is so much the case that many simply refer to him as `` the philosopher '' . Regarding Nietzsche , he 's one of the most entertaining , although since his ideas were so fragmented ( and since his life was cut short ) it is doubtful that his influence as a philosopher is likely to be very extensive 500 years from now . They 'll probably still be reading him in 500 years though . As for `` modern '' philosophers , I would have to say that Kant was the most influential since he had such a strong influence on almost everyone who came after him ( and unfortunately , they maintained his errors and amplified them over time ) . I would say that the most influential `` american '' philosopher would have to be Dewey . But as to the question of what philosopher will be most highly regarded in 500 years , it may very well be Ayn Rand ( who in every important respect was `` American '' , but was born in Russia ) . But I guess that remains to be seen . -- Brian

The stats show he is a mediocre pitcher at best ( this year is another case ) , he just happened to win 21 games . I saw many of his games last year , he did pitch some good games . But this crap about being a clutch pitcher is nonsense , he was constantly giving up go ahead runs in the 6-8th innings ( the clutch innings ) and the Jays would somehow scrape a win for him . Another major factor in his 21 wins , is that Cito ' I dont realize i have a bullpen ' Gaston would leave Morris in for ever , therefore giving him many more chances to win games ( i believe this is the major reason he won 21 games last year ) .

AT any case , a lot of picture-file viewers that will convert , say , between .gif , etc , to .bmp *will* convert to .rle . I Know for a fact that PaintShop ( shareware from cica ; /desktop , I think , filename psVVV.zip ( I think , where VVV is the ver . number . If that 's not true , let me know and I '' ll post a corection ) . This , however , will write your .rle file with a .bmp extension , so you have to rename it . NOW , another thing ... . this is from the windows ' FAQ : your file has to be less than 64 K ( at least that 's what the faq says , but Mine wont work for more than about 30 ... maybe they mend 32K , I do n't know ) . Your file has to fit VGA size ( 480 * 860 , or whatever standard vga size is . ) If you use a non-vga screen ( e.g . Cga , ega , svga , there is also a way to do it , but I thing instead of vgalogo.lgo you use another file , such as cgalogo.lgo , egalogo.lgo , or something . I 'm not sure about this , as I have a vga , but i 'm sure you could find it in the faq ( a windows help ver . of which *is* available at cica , but do n't konw the filename ) . ALSO ... .your .bmp has to be 16 COLOURS Or less . These specs rule out some of the good .bmp 's . I found cartoon drawings work quite well as they have the advantage of looking good with little memory . Finally , REMEMBER TO SAVE YOUR CURRENT WIN.COM before , and put your new win.com in the windows directory . Also , do n't start windows from a directory where another win.com is present , as *that* is used instead of the one in the windows dir , and win . wo n't start .

From : lvc @ cbnews.cb.att.com ( Larry Cipriani ) Subject : Don Kates ' talk on the Branch Davidians Organization : Ideology Busters , Inc. Keywords : Kates Lines : 110 This was posted by Lyn Bates to the firearms-politics mailing list : I recently learned that Don Kates was going to be in Boston to give a talk at the Harbard Law School about the Waco situation . ( Of course , this was all set up after the incident started but long before its unhappy conclusion . ) So , yesterday I went to hear him . What follows is a rough summary of what I think I heard him say , which should not be taken as exactly what he actually said ... Kates started by saying that since he did n't know any more about the fire than the audience did ( it had just happened the day before ) , he would not discuss that , but would concentrate on the original raid . Koresh definitely was not playing with a full deck . But so what ? This is n't the first time that the leader of a new , small religious group has been ridiculed by the public . Extreme religious views nearly always fuel hatred and mistrust . The first amendment applies , maybe especially , to people like Koresh . Lengthy digression into the history of police organizations in the US . There were none until about 1830 , when they began in metropolitan areas . Police originally were not armed ; if they found a crime in progress , they called local armed citizens to help . Many began to carry arms for protection despite regulations against them , eventually the laws were changed to allow them to carry guns . The original intent was to have many small police departments , jealous of one another and competitive , but not large enough to be a threat to liberty , hence the plethora of organizations ranging from postal inspectors to the coast guard . When the FBI was started , agents did not have the authority oto carry guns ( they were to be , after all , a bureau of investigation , not a police force ) . `` All police agencies will be misused by anyone in power to maintain that power . '' The BATF started as a tax collection agency , whose primary job was to raid illegal stills . When the price of sugar went up so high that moonshiners no longer found their trade no longer profitable , many illegal stills disappeared , and the BATF needed something else to do to justify its existence , so it turned to activities like phony raids on gun stores . Around the time when the BATF 's annual budget is under review , the media is alerted by the BATF to come to such-and-such a place , where at a pre-arranged time , a bunch of cars full of BATF agents roar up to the door and the media get great pictures of the agents entering the premises of a gun dealer suspected of not keeping books properly . The media isn't invited in for the boring hours of agents leafing through paperwork , but if any irregularities are found , the media gets to cover the agents removing armfuls of guns from the premises , and the luckless FFL in chains . The Waco incident happened a few weeks before BATF 's budget was up for review . Kates ' opinion is that it was a staged publicity stunt that went bad , and that the BATF never thought for a moment that they would actually be shot at , or they would have planned the raid differently ( not sending 100 agents over open ground with no cover , for example ) , and would have had some medical personnel on hand . He confirmed that some years ago there was a warrant for Koresh 's arrest in connection with a murder charge , and the local sheriff called him on the phone and explained about it . Koresh sais , ok , come pick me up , and the sheriff did , temporarily confiscating all the guns so that they could be tested . Koresh was later cleared , release , and presumably got his guns back . At least at that time , he was rational enough to be approached rationally , and behaved in a reasonable manner . The BATF did n't take into account that , unlike most of the FFL 's they audit , Koresh was actually paranoid , and fostered paranoia in his followers . Thus the pubicity stunt looked like a real attack to them , and they reacted accordingly . With respect to the original warrant , it had not been unsealed when Kates was giving his talk , so he could not comment on it , except to mention that the BATF has been known to not double-check the veractiy of their informants , if they can manage to get a judge to issue a warrant . He had more to say about the way the warrant was served , which may have been completely illegal . Apparently the proper way to serve a warrant is to knock on the door and announce that you 're an officer with a warrant for thus-and-so ; if they do n't open the door and the evidence is flushable , then it is ok to break in the door . But since it is hard to flush guns down the toilet , there may have been no justification for the BATF breaking in the way they did . If the constitutional rights of the Davidians were violated by an invalid warrant , or by an improperly served warrant , then the Davidians may have been justified in their actons . A close look at one of the original films shows that one BATF agent _may_ have shot himself by accident when entering the building ; if so , this was the first shot fired ! The role of the media could have been a whole lot worse . After an initial position on the side of the BATF , the media began to come around to the view that this might be a situation in which legally armed citizens held off a bad , possibly illegal attack . A real cynic might say that the FBI went in when they did because it was clear that public opinion was beginning to change sides , and the FBI wanted to act before they lost the public 's sympathy . Should the BATF be abolished ? No . Police agencies _should_ be numerous , diverse , inefficient , decentralized , etc . Better a few inept accidents like this , than a move toward a single , large , well-organized , well-trained , powerful , domestic police force , which would eventually have even more tragic results . - Lyn Bates ( bates @ bbn.com ) PS Don Kates will be giving a shorter version of this talk at Boston College Law School next Tuesday , April 27 . I do n't know the exact time or place , but presumably a phone call to the BC law school could elicit that information . -- Larry Cipriani -- l.v.cipriani @ att.com

But I strongly dispute your notion that Croats had a similar older agenda , in fact , for the past century or two , Croats and Muslims have seen themselves as having a lot in common , and they generally had friendly relations . Your suggestion that Croat-Muslim relationship is anything like Serb-Muslim relationship is completely wrong . To say that Croats and Muslims have a lot in common does not imply they are not separate peoples . The events of the past two years clearly show Muslim determination to remain separate : in their alliance with Croats , they maintained this separation . Croats would have accepted a much closer relationship , I think . This century plus of building bridges between these two friendly peoples is now at risk , because of the inexorable logic of war . Since Bosnian Serbs ( 32 % of population ) have 10 times more heavy weapons than Bosnian Muslims ( 44 % ) and Croats ( 17 % ) combined , they have squeezed Muslims and Croats into only 30 % of the territory . Muslims lost more territory than Croats ( who built defenses early on ) . Under these conditions , any alliance is bound to fall apart since it is easier to recover lost land from Croats than from Serbs . The only thing keeping this in check was the hope of reversal of fortunes through foreign military intervention and lifting of the arms embargo . Since Warren Christopher had no luck persuading the Europeans to go along with this , this hope was dashed . Having no prospect of outside help , the former allies turned on each other , like two starved animals in a tight cage . This inexorable logic , of course , got plenty of help from Serbian intelligence operatives , who were doing everything to build mistrust between Croats and Muslims for over a year . A timely intervention to stop Serbian aggression would have prevented this . Sadly , nothing was done to create a balance of power on the ground . As long as the Serbs enjoy 10:1 advantage , they can break any alliance , even among friends . This is tragic , but hardly new : `` divide et impera '' was used by ancient Romans with success . In my view , Bosnian Muslims and Croats managed to resist this divisive strategy reasonably well until May 9 , 1993 , when the hope of reversal of fortunes was lost . I have a question for the distinguished diplomats : do they believe Balkan peoples are experimental cannon fodder ? I 'd like to know what did they expect when they decided to enforce the arms embargo which solidified Serbian 10:1 advantage in heavy weapons ; how did they expect to prevent fragmentation of the Muslim and Croat defense forces ; and how on Earth do they hope to restore peace without justice ? The implications of this immoral approach I can not begin to predict , but I am filled with foreboding ... Sincerely , Josip

My thought , Airline pilots lately have been complaining about how laptops being used in flight mess with the plane's instruments . If this can be hyped up , manufacturers may start building laptops with even lower emmisions . It would probably still be possible to pick up with surveillance equipment , but at this point , it would be a lot cheaper to mask the remaining signals with TEMPEST techniques .

Special Notes : * I have not updated this FAQ for the recently-announced OpenWindows 4 , due to ship later this year . * Yes , Sun is moving to Motif , along with all of COSE . But the Motif to which they move will be a new Motif , with some of the OPEN LOOK UI features added . * Yes , OpenWindows 4 will use DPS instead of NeWS . NeWS is dead . This means TNT is dead , too . * XView and OLIT will be supported , but probably not enhanced after the next release . I do n't know if there will be a source release of XView 3.1 or not . * The COSE Environment will include at least some of Sun 's DeskSet , ported to Motif . Look for Calendar Manager and Mailtool , at least . * Yes , the new Mailtool will be MIME-compliant . Frequently Asked Questions for X11 are posted to comp.windows.x monthly .

OPEN LOOK is a specification of a Graphical User Interface ( GUI ) . A GUI determines the ` look and feel ' of a system -- the shape of windows , buttons and scroll-bars , how you resize things , how you edit files , etc . The OPEN LOOK GUI is specified , developed and maintained jointly by Sun Microsystems and AT & T ( or USL ? ) . See Also : Bibliography @ What is OpenWindows ? OpenWindows is a windowing environment that conforms to the OPEN LOOK Graphical User Interface Specifications . It 's compatible with the X11 window system from MIT as well as ( currently ) Sun 's NeWS and SunView , so you can intermix programs written for any of those systems . It comes from Sun and also with System V Release 4 from certain vendors . OpenWindows is sometimes also called openwin or xnews , after the program used to start it and the main executable itself , respectively . It should not be called ` Windows ' or 'OPEN LOOK ' or ` OpenLook ' , as these terms are either wrong or apply to something else . A commerical OpenWindows source licence costs about $ 5,000 for the server , plus about $ 25,000 for DeskSet , and another $ 40,000 for ToolTalk . The current versions of OpenWindows for various platforms are : SunOS 4.1.1 on Sun 3 : 2.0 Solaris 1.x ( SunOS 4.1.x ) on SPARC : 3.0 Solaris 2.0 ( SunOS 5 ) on SPARC : 3.0.1 See Also : Mixing X11 and OpenWindows Where can I get it ? @ What are OLIT , XView and TNT ? These are all toolkits for programmers to use in developing programs that conform to the OPEN LOOK specifications . See the Bibliography for documentation on the individual toolkits . Here 's a brief summary : OLIT was AT & T 's OPEN LOOK Intrinsics Toolkit for the X Window system ; it used a widget set , and was probably the easiest for people who were already X11/Xt programmers to learn . You could buy the source from AT & T , although you did n't get the same version tht Sun ship . Sun includes the OLIT library in OpenWindows ( q.v . ) ; it is also often included in System V Release 4 . It was written in C. The release of OLIT in OpenWindows 3.0 was OLIT 3.0 . OLIT support passed to USL ( then a division of AT & T , now owned by Novell ) , who replaced it with MoOLIT ( q.v. ) . Note that because of the nature of Xt subclassing , you will probably want or need OLIT source in order to develop a large application or anything else that uses subclasses . [ see the proceedings of the 1991 X Technical Conference ] XView is Sun 's toolkit for X11 , written in C. XView is similar in programmer interface to SunView . There 's even a shell script to help migrate source code from SunView to XView . XView is often said to be the easiest toolkit to learn if you are not familiar with X Windows . The XView toolkit is included in OpenWindows , and full source is available by anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu ( and elsewhere ) . The current version of XView from Sun is 3.0 . Despite rumours to the contrary -- some even from within Sun -- the XView toolkit is *NOT* about to be dropped by Sun . XView *will* be included in the next release of OpenWindows , unlike NeWS . On the other hand , the XView toolkit is not likely to receive as much attention from Sun in the future as OLIT . The NeWS Toolkit ( TNT ) was an object-oriented programming system based on the PostScript language and NeWS . TNT implements many of the OPEN LOOK interface components required to build the user interface of an application . It 's currently included in OpenWindows . The current version of TNT from Sun is 3.1 ; Release 3 contains some incompatibilities with ` tNt ' 1.0 and TNT 2.0 , but Sun are committed to supporting the API , at least until they stop NeWS support some time later this year and replace it with Display PostScript . Wail . You might ask what ` is committed to ' means in this context ; the answer seems to be that it means absolutely nothing . Sun currently asserts that it is committed to OLIT , however . The C++ User Interface Toolkit ( UIT ) consists of an object-oriented C++ class library layered on top of XView and a tool to generate code from DevGuide 3 GIL files . The UIT also includes features that simplify event management and the use of PostScript and color . It is said to be compatible with OpenWindows V2 and V3 , and presumably V3.0.1 , since the release mentions that it works on Solaris 2 . UIT is not an official Sun-supported product but an ongoing project of various people within Sun . It can be found on export.lcs.mit.edu in the MIT contrib directory as UITV2.tar.Z ( use binary mode ! ) . @ Where does Motif fit in ? It does n't : - ) . Motif is an alternative Graphical User Interface that is being developed by OSF . It has a ` look and feel ' reminiscent of Microsoft Windows and the OS/2 Presentation Manager . There are no non- commercial Motif toolkits available , although the Motif source is sold reasonably cheaply by OSF . Although Motif is currently available on more platforms than OpenWindows , the OPEN LOOK GUI is almost certainly used on many more machines , simply because Sun ( and SysVR4 ) have such a large installed base . Sun 's CD/WARE Volume 2 contains a roadmap for improving Motif applications by converting them to OLIT [ : - ) ] ; there are also notes in the ` Periodic Table ' OLIT demo , $ OPENWINHOME/demo/olittable . @ What is MoOLIT ? MoOLIT is a version of OLIT from AT & T/USL that lets users choose between a Motif and an OPEN LOOK UI feel at run-time . It will be part of System V Release 4.2 . Contact : Joanne Newbauer , jo @ usl.com , ( 908 ) 522-6677 @ What about that Display PostScript thing ? Sun and Adobe have agreed that Sun will include the DPS extension to X in the next release of OpenWindows . DPS is essentially a badly designed hack on top of a slow Level 2 PostScript interpreter intended to give a very small subset of the functionality of NeWS whilst simultaneously being harder to use , as I understand it . The only real advantage it has over NeWS is that the manual is much smaller , being generally less complete ; DPS is also available on more kinds of machine . Performance on our RS/6000 is not suitable for interactive work ; what it will be like on the SPARCStation remains to be seen . Note that whereas X/NeWS fonts are shared by both subsystems , the DPS extension to X does _not_ make Type 1 PostScript fonts available to ordinary X11 programs . It is not like ATM on a PC in this regard . ( there is at least one third-party version which does make fonts available , however ) Subject : Window Managers -- olwm , olvwm @ What are olwm and olvwm ? They are window managers . A window manager is the part of the X Window system ( e.g . X11 ) that is responsible for deciding how to lay out windows on the screen , and for managing the user 's interaction with the windows . Olwm is the standard OPEN LOOK window manager . It 's included with all of the OpenWindows ( q.v . ) implementations , and you can also get the source by ftp , since Sun donated it . Olvwm is a version of olwm that manages a ` virtual desktop ' ( hence the ` v ' in its name ) . It shows a little map on the screen , with the currently displayed area represented by a little rectangle . You can move around by dragging the rectangle or with the arrow keys . This lets you run several clients ( applications ) and move the display around from one to the other . Olvwm was derived from the OpenWindows 3.0 olwm by Scott Oaks ; you need to have XView 3.0 to compile it . Get olvwm from an ftp site such as export.lcs.mit.edu ( in the contrib directory ; there are three patches ) . @ Can I use my favorite window manager with OpenWindows instead of olwm ? Yes . If you use twm , for example , or mwm , you wo n't be able to use the Pin and Unpin feature of olwm , and you ( probably ) wo n't see the footers some windows use to display certain messages . If you use twm , you 'll want to use the f.delete function to unpin menus and get rid of programs that do n't have a ` quit ' button when not run under olwm . For twm , put this in your $ HOME/.twmrc : LeftTitleButton `` target '' = f.delete where `` target '' is a 16x16 icon from /usr/include/X11/bitmaps . Alternatively , try # Add a menu to each window managed by twm or tvtwm LeftTitleButton `` : menu '' = f.menu `` OL.menu '' menu `` OL.menu '' { `` Quit '' f.delete } For mwm , you can double-click on the menu icon on the left of the title bar to dismiss a pop-up window ( I am told ) . See the manual page for your window manager ( twm , etc ) . Subject : OpenWindows , Terminals , and Other Displays @ Can I use olwm and olvwm without OpenWindows or on an X Terminal ? The OpenWindows xnews server combines SunView , NeWS ( PostScript ) and X11 . This means that it can run programs compiled for any of those systems . Unfortunately , it means that some OpenWindows programs need either NeWS or SunView support , and thus wo n't run on an X terminal . This includes pageview in particular . You can use olwm or olvwm ( see above ) on an X terminal or a non-Open- Windows display , and most OPEN LOOK clients ( e.g . OLIT or XView ones ) will work perfectly well . You may find that you get complaints about fonts not being found . If so , see the Fonts section below . If you are running the window manager built-in to an NCD terminal , you may have problems with input focus ; setting *Input : True in the terminal's XDefault file in /usr/lib/X11/xdm may or may not help . Subject : Configuration Files : Getting started with OpenWindows @ What configuration files do I need to know about ? .xinitrc and .xsessionrc The first time you run OpenWindows , a .xinitrc file will be created in your login directory ( $ HOME ) . If it already exists , you might have to edit it somewhat ; it 's simplest to move it and any other old X11 files you have to another directory , and then merge the old and new files . If your site uses xdm , you should use .xsession instead of .xinitrc , since xdm does n't look at your .xinitrc file . .openwin-init , .openwin-menu and .openwin-sys These are optional files you can create in your $ HOME directory , depending on which version of olwm or olvwm you use . Look in $ OPENWINHOME/lib ( normally /usr/openwin/lib ) for these files without the leading . and copy any you want to change . You may need to edit your .xinitrc to get them recognized . If you are not on an X terminal , you will want to run a console window ( such as cmdtool -C , shelltool -C , xterm -C ) or Chuck Musciano 's `` contool '' program so that system output will be directed there instead of writing over your screen . Note that .openwin-sys is not executed unless you edit .xinitrc . .Xdefaults You can put X Windows resource specifications in here . In particular , it is a good idea to include at least : OpenWindows.FocusLenience : true *Input : TRUE These allow non-ICCCM-compliant programs to receive input even if they forget to ask for it . Props , the program that runs when you select ` properties ' from the default root menu under olwm or olvwm , writes your choices into .Xdefaults . Do n't put comments in .Xdefaults , since ` props ' deletes them . .startup.ps This is the NeWS user profile file , read by OpenWindows ( actually xnews ) on startup . This is documented in the NeWS programming manual , near the back . The most useful thing to put here is PostScript code to change the keyboard repeat rate , although you must be very careful , since a syntax error in the PostScript means that xnews will either not start up at all or will get broken in strange ways . The NeWS manual gives code that is both incorrect and insufficient . WARNING : things in this file rarely work on both OpenWindows 2 and 3 . Note that the mouse speed is best set in your .xinitrc with xset m ; see the man page for xset ( `` man xset '' , and `` xset -help '' ) for more information . Here 's what $ HOME/.startup.ps should look like if you want a delay of about a third of a second ( 300000 microseconds ) , and a repeat rate of twenty or so keys per second ( 30000 microseconds between repeats ) for OpenWindows 3 . You 'll have to experiment a bit because the RepeatTime is the delay between keys sent , and thus does n't include the time to process each key , which is probably higher on my 4/110 than on your SuperSPARC 10/51 GTi injection : - ) Again , this is for OpenWindows 3 ... % do n't want the demos - see p. xxxii of NeWS Toolkit Reference Manual % /IncludeDemos ? false def UserProfile begin /KeyRepeatThresh 0 300000 timeval storetimeval def /KeyRepeatTime 0 30000 timeval storetimeval def % Note : 300000 and 30000 differ greatly ... end You must also have a .user.ps file in the same directory , like this : /NeWS 3 0 findpackage beginpackage /TNTCore 3 0 findpackage beginpackage /TNT 3 0 findpackage beginpackage ClassRepeatKeys pop % force repeat.ps to autoload endpackage endpackage endpackage If you change these parameters , you can test them without restarting the OpenWindows server like this : $ psh -i .startup.ps Welcome to X11/NeWS Version3 $ psh -i Welcome to X11/NeWS Version3 /classinit ClassRepeatKeys send % % % now press control-D You can also either of these two files ( .startup.ps and .user.ps ) to make the root window be `` retained '' , so that a PostScript drawing on the background wo n't be erased when you move windows : frambuffer /Retained true put will do this . Note that this may increase the amount of memory used by the NeWS server ( xnews ) dramatically . See also : Trouble Shooting : It Wo n't Let Me Type Trouble Shooting : Is there an easy way to edit Xdefaults ? Environment Variables @ How can I configure OPEN LOOK for a left-handed mouse and keyboard ? You can use xmodmap to change the mouse buttons , but be prepared for one or two occasional surprises . See also `` man 7 xview '' for a list of keybindings you can change , at least for XView programs . With OpenWindows 2.0 , you can use defaultsedit to set the mouse mappings and then let SunView handle them . The status returned by svenv should tell you whether your server is running under SunView or not ; put this in your .xinitrc : if eval ` svenv -env ` then xmodmap -e `` pointer = 1 2 3 '' input_from_defaults else xmodmap -e `` pointer = 3 2 1 '' fi @ How can I get the screen to go blank when the system is idle ? Run screenblank from /etc/rc.local if you can ; it 's a boring but effective screen saver . See ` man screenblank ' . Under Solaris 2 you 'll need to copy screenblank from an older system , as it 's not supplied . Then add a new file in /etc/rc2.d to make the system run screenblank automatically . Subject : Key Bindings , Cut and Paste @ How do I cut and paste between XTerm and OpenWindows programs ? To go from XTerm to textedit ( say ) : * Select the text you want to copy by dragging the SELECT mouse button in xterm * Press COPY in the XTerm ( this key is L6 , or Meta+c ( the O'Reilly XView manual gets this wrong ) * Move to the textedit window , and press PASTE ( L8 or Meta+v ) If this does n't work , see Trouble Shooting : Cut and Paste To go the other way , from textedit to XTerm : * Select the text in textedit . No need to use COPY * Move to the XTerm window and press ADJUST ( the middle mouse button ) . * You can also use the COPY/CUT and PASTE buttons . @ COPY/PASTE is boring . What short-cuts are available ? Quick Copy within textedit , mailtool , etc : * Click SELECT to get a text caret where you want the copied text to go * Press and HOLD DOWN the PASTE ( or CUT ) button * Select the text you want to copy/move . You 'll see that it 's underlined or crossed out , as appropriate . ( In the jed demo it goes grey ) * Let go of the PASTE ( or CUT ) button . * The text you underlined or crossed out appears at the insert caret . Drag and Drop to Move a Selection * Select the text you want to copy or move , by dragging or multiple- clicking the SELECT or ADJUST mouse button * Put the mouse pointer anywhere within the selection * Press and HOLD DOWN down the SELECT mouse button , and move the mouse pointer a little to the right ; you 'll see the cursor changes to be the first 3 letters of the text ( or some other icon ) . * Still holding SELECT down , move the mouse over the point where you want to drop the text * You may see the mouse pointer change to a rifle-sight or target , to show that it 's OK to drop things here * Let go of SELECT , and the text is moved . This works in text fields of dialogue boxes as well as in text subwindows . Drag and Drop to Copy a Selection * This is the same as using Drag and Drop to Move a Selection , except that you must hold the CONTROL key down as well as the SELECT mouse button . @ What are the default key bindings in textedit and elsewhere ? See the man page for textedit ( 1 ) for some of them . In general , the editing/moving commands go in the opposite direction when shifted - e.g . Ctrl+w deletes a word , and Ctrl+W deletes the word to the right of the insert point . Meta-i - include file Meta-f - find selection ( forward/backward ) Ctrl-a - start of line Ctrl- < - back word Ctrl-e - end of line Ctrl- > - forward word Ctrl-w - delete word Ctrl-u - delete to start/END of line Ctrl-Return - move to end/START of document See the O'Reilly XView Reference Manual for a list of some of the default keys ; see also the olwm or olvwm manual page . @ What can I put in my .ttysrc ? Where is it documented ? See the manual page for shelltool . Subject : Applications : Finding Out ... Contact SunSoft ( or Sun ) and ask for the Catalyst OPEN LOOK guide , which lists over 200 pages of applications , and also the _huge_ Catalyst listing of products for Suns , updated six-monthly . Sun 's free CDWare CD/ROMs each contain demo versions of several popular OPEN LOOK applications . Often you can simply contact the vendor concerned to have the license upgraded from demo , and receive the full product documentation . SunPICS produces a CD/ROM for NeWSPrint users , Printer 's Pallate , which contains NeWSprint drivers for a variety of printers and plotters , as well as 600 scaleable fonts that you can license . There is a separate FAQ posting in comp.windows.open-look that lists a number of free and commercial aplications ; mail lee @ sq.com for a copy , including OPEN LOOK UI Application List in the Subject for a faster reply . Subject : DeskSet , Mailtool , Calendar Manager , etc . @ Is there a tty-based interface to cm ( Calendar Manager ) ? Yes , cm_delete , cm_insert and cm_lookup ; these all have manual pages . If `` man cm_delete '' does n't work or gives strange messages , see under Trouble Shooting : Strange Error Messages , below . @ How can I arrange to have my .signature included in my outgoing mail ? The best way is : $ cd $ cp /usr/lib/.textswrc . $ chmod +w .textswrc edit .textswrc ( use vi , textedit , or whatever you prefer ) add the follwing : KEY_RIGHT ( 3 ) FILTER cat ~/.signature ( you might need to change ~ to $ HOME ) Now pressing R3 will insert your .signature file . Subject : Fonts @ Does OpenWindows support Type 1 PostScript fonts ? Yes , under either Solaris 2.0 or 2.1 ( I 'm not sure which ) . Or , Not Yet , in other words . If you have FrameMaker there is a utility to import them , I 'm told . The 57 fonts supplied with OpenWindows are fully hinted , though , and comparing them to the Microsoft Windows and Apple TrueType fonts is interesting ... The F3 font format is described in a publication from the Sun OpenFonts group , listed in the Bibliography below . Documentation on the unbundled version of TypeScaler is also available from Sun OpenFonts . You can buy F3 fonts from SunPICS , Monotype , Linotype , URW and probably other major foundries . SunPICS ' NeWSPrint software supports Type 1 fonts . @ Improving font rendering time Although the Sun type renderer ( TypeScaler ) is pretty fast , it 's not as fast as loading a bitmap : - ) . You can pre-generate bitmap fonts for sizes that you use a lot , and you can also alter and access the font cache parameters . If you have a lot of memory you might want to increase the font cache size . $ psh -i Welcome to X11/NeWS Version3 < -- - psh will say this at you currentfontmem = % type this line ... 300 % and here 's whai my server was using -- 300 Kbytes 1024 setfontmem % Just to check : currentfontmem = 1024 See pp . 328ff of the NeWS 3.0 Programmer 's Guide . You need to say psh -i so that the PostScript packages are loaded - see the psh man page . @ Making bitmap fonts for faster startup : $ mkdir $ HOME/myfonts $ cd $ HOME/myfonts $ makeafb -20 -M $ OPENWINHOME/lib/fonts/Bembo.f3b Creating Bembo20.afb $ convertfont -b Bembo20.afb Bembo20.afb- > ./Bembo20.fb Chars parameter greater than number of characters supplied . $ ls Bembo20.afb Bembo20.fb Synonyms.list $ bldfamily * Bembo ./Bembo.ff ( Encoding : latin ) cat : ./Compat.list : No such file or directory $ xset +fp ` pwd ` $ xset fp rehash If you want the server to see your new font directory every time , add this directory to your FONTPATH environment variable in one of your start-up files , e.g . .login or .profile . @ Converting between font formats ( convertfont , etc . ) You can also use Folio fonts with an X11 server , by converting them to a bitmap ( X11 bdf format ) first . Your licence forbids you from using the fonts on another machine , and unless you have NeWSPrint you shouldn't use them for printing . Having said all that ... you can use makeafb and convertfont to generate bdf files that you can compile with bdftosnf or bdftopcf . Use mftobdf ( from the SeeTeX distribution ) to convert TeX pk fonts to X11 bdf format , which you can then use with either X11 or OenWindows . You can also use der Mouse 's `` getbdf '' to get bdf fonts from a running X display server -- ftp : larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu ( 132.206.1.1 ) /X/getbdf @ Xview/OLIT fonts at 100 dpi There are n't any . More precisely , the various text fonts , such as Lucida Typewriter Sans , are available at 100 dpi , and in fact are scalable under OpenWindows . The glyph fonts are bitmaps , and don't scale very well . Subject : Trouble Shooting : Strange Error Messages @ No manual entry for cm_lookup If man does n't seem to find OpenWindows commands , even though you are running OpenWindows , try setting the MANPATH environment variable : MANPATH= $ OPENWINHOME/share/man : /usr/man ; export MANPATH or setenv MANPATH $ OPENWINHOME/share/man : /usr/man for csh users . $ OPENWINHOME should be /usr/openwin on most systems . @ window : Window creation failed to get new fd @ window : Base frame not passed parent window in environment @ Can not create base frame . Process aborted . These messages all come from SunView programs . SunView was an earlier windowing system for Suns , and was not networked . Some of the SunView programs are still around in /usr/bin , and have names that are the same as their OpenWindows counterparts . You almost certainly want to run the programs in $ OPENWINHOME instead . Set your path so that $ OPENWINHOME/bin ( and $ OPENWIN/bin/xview for OpenWindows 2 ) come before /bin ( or /usr/bin , they 're the same ) , or you 'll get the SunView versions of mailtool , cmdtool , shelltool , etc . @ memory fault - core dumped If you get this from the binder , or if binder vanishes suddenly , get the following patches : 100493-02 Binder 100524-03 Cetables 100626-03 Tooltalk @ Trouble compiling Xt , Xmu or OLIT programs : _get_wmShellWidgetClass If you are using OpenWindows 3.0 ( X11R4-based Xt ) , contact your local Sun office and request the following patches : 100512-02 4.1.x OpenWindows 3.0 libXt Jumbo patch 100573-03 4.1.x OpenWindows 3.0 undefined symbols when using shared libXmu If you ca n't install the patch , a workaround is to add -u get_wmShellWidgetClass -u get_applicationShellWidgetClass on the link ( ld or cc ... -o ... ) line . An alternative is to add -assert nodefinitions to CFLAGS in your Makefile , or even in Imake.tmpl . Subject : Trouble Shooting : It Wo n't Let Me Type @ When I try to type into some programs , I just get beeps or nothing happens It is a good idea to include at least : OpenWindows.FocusLenience : true *Input : TRUE in your .Xdefaults file , as these allow non-ICCCM-compliant programs to receive input even if they forget to ask for it . See the next item for editing .Xdefaults Subject : Trouble Shooting : Cut and Paste not working @ I ca n't paste from xterm to XView ( including Sun DeskSet ) programs Under OpenWindows 2 , you need to add the following either to your $ HOME/.Xdefaults file , or to $ OPENWINHOME/lib/app-defaults/XTerm instead : XTerm*VT100.Translations : # override \ < Key > L6 : select-set ( CLIPBOARD ) \n\ < Key > L8 : insert-selection ( CLIPBOARD ) You must not move the mouse between ending the selection and pressing L8 ( the Paste key ) ! Under OpenWindows 3 , this is already in the app-defaults file , so if it is n't working , check that XFILESEARCHPATH is set to /usr/openwin/lib/ % T/ % N % S and if it is n't , either set it or copy/merge the above lines from $ OPENWINHOME/lib/app-defaults/XTerm into /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/XTerm . [ See also : Environment Variables ] This version automatically puts each xterm selection onto the clipboard : XTerm*VT100.translations : # override\n\ ~Ctrl ~Meta < Btn2Up > : insert-selection ( PRIMARY , CUT_BUFFER0 ) \n\ ~Ctrl ~Meta < BtnUp > : select-end ( PRIMARY , CUT_BUFFER0 , CLIPBOARD ) \n\ < KeyPress > L8 : insert-selection ( CLIPBOARD ) [ Note : be sure that the \n\ is at the very end of the line , there must be no following spaces , and any + or | signs showing that this FAQ file was altered must also be removed ! ] If you are using X11R5 , you may find that adding the lines < Key > L10 : start-extend ( ) select-end ( PRIMARY , CLIPBOARD , CUT_BUFFER0 ) \n\ < KeyRelease > L10 : kill-selection ( ) \n before the < KeyPress > L8 line will make L10 ( CUT ) work as a cut key ! If you alter $ HOME/.Xdefaults instead , you must use what X calls a ` more specific ' resource name : xterm.vt100.translations will do . @ I ca n't paste from XView ( including Sun DeskSet ) programs to xterm If you do n't have the Sun L keys on the left of your keyboard , you can use Meta-x , Meta-c and Meta-v for cut , coy and paste respectively . You can change the keys by adding the following two lines to your .Xdefaults file , edited as you wish ( the values shown here are the defaults ) : Openwindows.KeyboardCommand.Copy : c+Meta , L6 OpenWindows.KeyboardCommand.Paste '' , `` v+Meta , L8 Lists of resources are in the manual page for xview , and also in the thinnish blue book ` Companion to Volume 7 , XView Reference Manual ' from O'Reilly , and also in the olwm and olvwm manual pages . @ I always get the same piece of text when I press PASTE ( L8 , Meta+v ) Remove the file /tmp/textsw_shelf and see if that helps ; see also the next item . @ Cut Copy and Paste do n't work at all ( OpenWindows only ) Oh dear . Use ps -xuaww | grep xv to check that sv_xv_sel_svc is running and that either you or root started it , depending on whether you started OpenWindows with `` openwin '' or by logging in through xdm . If not , start it . If it dies , check that there is no /tmp/.sv_xv_sel_svc before restarting it - you may need to be root to remove it , or you can reboot your workstation . Check that there is space in /tmp ( use `` df /tmp '' ) , and also see if there are a lot of files there with names like /tmp/tty.txt.a01246 ; if there are several hundred of them , cut and paste may take so long that it times out . Quit any deskset tools such as mailtool , filemgr and cm ( calendar ) , start a terminal emulator and remove and /tmp/tty.txt* and /tmp/Text* files that are still there . It 's simplest to quit openwin and start it again after doing that , if cut and paste was broken , but if it starts working again you can just carry on . Note that files in /tmp not owned by you might be in use by another worker comrade , so do n't remove those without checking first ! Subject : Trouble Shooting : Not authorized to use display If you get error messages that look like Xlib : connection to `` :0.0 '' refused by server Xlib : Internal error during connection authorization check Error : Ca n't Open display try , on the machine running OpenWindows or X11 , xhost +machine where `` machine '' is the computer on which you ran the command that failed . If you want to let other users run programs on the same machine as you , using your display , you will have to type the bizarre-looking xhost + ` hostname ` ( or xhost +happyboy , if happyboy is the name of your workstation ) . This lets ANY user on ` happyboy ' access your display . With OpenWindows 3.0 you can also use xauth , and the Programmer 's Guide describes how to do this in Chapter 8 , p. 101 . This is more secure . Also check the man page for fbtab ( 5 ) to stop other users accessing the framebuffer directly ! Also note that there is a Sun patch for OpenWindows 3.0 under SunOS 4.1.1 to fix a serious security problem . It is available through your local Sun Answer Center as well as through anonymous ftp from ftp.uu.net [ 192.48.96.2 ] system in /sun-dist : Fix PatchID Filename Checksum loadmodule 1076118 100448-01.tar.Z 04354 5 On an X Terminal , there may be a setup menu that lets you change or disable the list of hosts that can access the display . If you start getting this message after you 've been logged in overnight , there might be a cron job that 's removing the Unix sockets in /tmp that are used to communicate with the server when $ DISPLAY does n't have a hostname before the : , or is empty . Have the system administrator change the cron script to skip sockets . Subject : Trouble Shooting : other common problems @ I get console error messages on my screen and they do n't go away ( Sun 3 or 4 ) If `` refresh '' makes the messages vanish , but new ones come along later , you need to run `` xterm -C '' from your .xinitrc , or start one up in the background and then choose Save Workspace from the Workspace- > Utilities menu . Better still , pick up `` contool '' and run that . Get it from export.lcs.mit.edu in the contrib directory . It will monitor the console and open , flash its icon or beep when a message appears ; it 's very easy to configure . If `` refresh '' from the Workspace- > Utilities menu does n't make the messages , go away ... a Sun with a cg4 frame buffer has two screens - you can move the mouse off the right-hand ( by default ) edge of the screen and onto a whole new ( but monochrome ) display , called `` :0.1 '' . See the man . page for openwin ; I have a shell script that checks for this and , if there 's a /dev/cgfour0 , does openwin -dev /dev/cgfour0 -dev /dev/bwtwo0 If you are running X11 or OpenWindows 2 , you might need to add this to your .xinitrc or other startup file : ( eval ` svenv -display unix:0.1 -env ` olvwm -display unix:0.1 ) & Later releases of olwm and olvwm do this automatically . You can also run switcher -e 0 to get rid of the messages . Also , see the note about contool , above . @ Is there an easy way of editing .Xdefaults ? Use ` props ' , which appears in the default root menu as ` properties ' . This starts ` props ' , a property editor which will re-write your .Xdefaults after removing comments . It then applies any changes . Keep comments by using `` comment . '' instead of `` ! `` , for example , comment . *.font : Palatino-Italic-37 @ How do I get the File manager to use emacs instead of textedit ? set the default editor to sh -c `` exec emacs -font lucidasanstypewriter-18 \ '' $ FILE\ '' '' ( you can change the font if you prefer a smaller one ) @ How do I run OpenWindows in inverse video ? This tends not to work under OpenWindows 2 . With OpwnWindows 3.0 , there are various ways , including using -bg and -fg options . If you're using OpenWindows 2 on a Sun 3 , probably the best you can do ( short of upgrading the workstation to a SPARC ! ) is to use xterm instead of cmdtool . @ Why do n't flat check-boxes work ? A known bug may make Guide 's output dump core if you use these . A workaround is to edit the Guide output , as it 's only Guide 's output that 's broken , not the actual check-box code . This applies only to versions of DevGuide before Devguide 3.0 . If you're still using an ancient DevGuide , you should upgrade as soon as possible ; the new one is fantastic ! @ When I leave OpenWindows , my screen goes blank or my mouse cursor stays on the screen . Try running clear_colormap ; if this helps , put it as the last line in the shell script you use to start OpenWindows ( e.g . ` openwin ' ) . @ When I use snapshot , the system crashes , or the server hangs , or something . This was a bug related to some systems only . The only work-round was to use some other screen dump program , such as xwd , xv 2.21 or xgrabsc . @ Why have some of my function keys stopped working ? Keys F11 and F12 changed from SunF36 and SunF37 to SunXK_F36 and SunXK_F37 respectively in OpenWindows 3 . Applications must be recompiled , or you might be able to use xmodmap or the public domain xkeycaps program to change your keyboard layout back again . @ When I type shelltool or cmdtool or textedit , I get the Sunview version See under `` Trouble Shooting : Strange Error Messages '' below . ( see also next item ) @ Mixing X11 and OpenWindows ( see also next item ) Note that OpenWindows 3.0 includes the X11R4 core distribution ( to patch level 18 ) , but not the contrib directory . These notes apply to OpenWindows 2.0 , although you could also the do same sort of thing with OpenWindows 3.0 and X11R5 . Install the X11 libraries in /usr/lib/X11 . You can intermix OpenWindows and X11R4 or X11R5 , they 're all compatible in this respect . Put the X11 binaries in ( for example ) /usr/bin/X11 . Put /usr/bin/X11 last in your PATH , so that you get OpenWindows versions of programs instead of X11 ones where appropriate , although this is a matter of preference . In any event , put the OpenWindows bin directory first -- see the preceding item for more details on that . If you have /bin ( or /usr/bin , they 're the same directory on SunOS ) earlier in your PATH than $ OPENWINHOME/bin/xview , you 'll get SunView programs instead of OpenWindows ones ! Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH so that /usr/openwin/lib is last , after the X11 library directory . This does n't matter with OpenWindows 3.0 , but with older versions you 'll get error messages from X11 programs if you don't do this . The messages are generally harmless ( see next item ) , although xdm core dumps if this is n't right . Set OPENWINHOME to the directory containing OpenWindows if it isn't /usr/openwin . See Also : Environment Variables ( especially XFILESEARCHPATH ) . @ I get error messages on my screen about ld.so : libX11.so.4 not found set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to be /usr/openwin . If you also use X11 , use /usr/lib : /usr/5lib : /usr/openwin/lib If you put this in a shell script or your .profile , use $ { OPENWINHOME-/usr/openwin } /lib instead of /usr/openwin ; this is for /bin/sh ; for csh it is different . @ I launch my filemgr and I get ld.so : map heap error ( 9 ) at /dev/zero Your system needs to be patched . Look in $ OPENWINHOME/lib/OSpatches and install the patch . @ Why does n't AnswerBook run for me ? You must be running OpenWindows to use AnswerBook . It wo n't run under X11 ( on an X terminal or on anything else ) because it uses NeWS to draw the PostScript text and pictures . If you are using OpenWindows 3.0 , you need to use the OpenWindows 3.0 compatible navigator ; it 's called .navigator.ow3 on the AnswerBook CD/ROM . If all AnswerBook users are using OpenWindows 3.0 , you can replace navigator wih .navigator.ow3 altogether ( rename the old one first to satisfy your sense of paranoia ! ) The navigator.ow3 binary is also on CD/Ware Vol 2 . Note that the data files are in PostScript , so you can look at them with a PostSript viewer ( q.v. ) . @ Why are n't there any fish in realxfishdb ? A fixed version of realxfishdb is available by ftp from ftp.eng.auburn.edu [ 131.204.10.91 ] as /pub/realxfishdb.Z @ Why is the Properties choice disabled in the Window menu ? It is n't implemented yet . Many programs do respond to the Properties Key ( L3 ) , though , or have a pop-up menu with Properties on it . @ File completion in the C-shell is broken in cmdtool Sadly true , but use shelltool or xterm instead and it 's fine . It also works if you run command tool on a remote machine . Fixed in OpenWindows 3.0.1 shipped with Solaris 2 . @ When I run OLIT programs , some of the widgets are red ! Release 3 of OLIT added mouseless operation ; action widgets can be selected via the keyboard . The currently selected item is highlighted in red ( the ` Red Stain ' ) to show that it has the input focus . To disable it in most places , add this to your $ HOME/.Xdefaults file : *traversalOn : off *TextEdit.traversalOn : on *TextField.traversalOn : on You can change the color using ( for example ) *InputFocusColor : grey50 *input*FocusColor : green *List*inputFocusColor : < your background color > See the man page resources ( 3w ) , at the start of the OLIT 3 Widget Set Reference Manual included in the OpenWindows 3 programmer documentation . Meanwhile contact your distributor and ask for patch id 100451-30 , the OLIT/3.0 CTE Jumbo Patch . @ When I run several programs , the colors on the screen all change when I move into a different window ! ( `` colormap flashing '' ) This is becasue most hardware can only display a few colors at a time . However , you can minimise the effect with the following procedure : * Start all the applications with colors that you wish to reserve . * Run cmap_compact save to create the .owcolors file * Put the line cmap_compact init near the start of your start-up file ( .xinitrc ) * Exit and then restart the window system . * cmap_compact init will push those colors .owcolors to the end of the colormap and reserves them . Also note that control-L2 locks the colors of the current window , and Control-L4 unlocks them -- this is described in the olwm manual page . @ pageiew uses the wrong colors , or makes the colormap flash ( see above ) : This problem was reported by people for some reason running the Motif window manager ( mwm ) with OpenWindows . Try running pageview like this : $ OPENWINHOME/bin/reservecolors -svmono $ OPENWINHOME/bin/pageview $ OPENWINHOME/bin/reservecolors -discard @ XDM breaks things Command tool does n't like being run without a Unix ` controlling terminal ' . Use /etc/setsid to start your command tools and all will be well . SunView applications may need to be run with svenv , as in svenv -exec /usr/bin/traffic because xdm wo n't set the necessary environment variables . Note that the MIT xdm starts up the X server as root , which is a security hole for OpenWindows ; use the OpenWindows 3.0 xdm or be aware that your users can access files and start Unix processes ass root ... @ Function keys 11 and 12 stopped working In OpenWindows 3.0 , the X11 names ( `` keysyms '' ) for these keys was changed to SunXK_F36 and SunXK_F37 . Code which uses them should be recompiled , or you might be able to get away with xmodmap -e 'keysym SunXK_F36 = SunF36' Subject : Trouble Shooting : XView problems This section is here only until an XView FAQ appears , which has been promised , but has n't reached here . Note that there is also a usenet newsgroup , alt.toolkits.xview , although it does n't sem to have very wide distribution and has triffic of the order of one or two articles per month . You should also look at the FAQ in comp.windows.x . @ how do I set the font of individual Scrolling List items ? PANEL_LIST_FONT takes an int row_number and an Xv_opaque font_handle . PANEL_LIST_FONTS take a NULL terminated list of Xv_opaque font_handles . There is no easy way to make an entire list fixed width font . You have to make sure that you always specify PANEL_LIST_FONT when you insert a new row into that list , or write a convenience function insert_row ( list , row , string ) that hides the nasty bits . @ how do I keep an XView pop-up window displayed after a button is pressed ? In the button callback , do xv_set ( button , PANEL_NOTIFY_STATUS , XV_ERROR , NULL ) ; This will keep the window visible . You might also need to investigate the MENU_NOTIFY_STATUS attribute . @ how do I make an XView button look pressed ? call panel_begin_preview ( ) and panel_cancel_preview ( ) ; these are documented in -- er -- the XView 3 source ... @ OpenWindows 3 imake does n't work properly Here is Greg Earle 's patch , to be applied in $ OPENWINHOME ; note that you should edit lib/config/sun.cf afterwards to get OSName and OSMinorVersion right ( MinorVersion is 1 in SunOS 4.1.2 , for example ) .

This list is for OpenWindows 3.0 -- differences for OpenWindows 2.0 are marked , and I 've added some comments for users of X11R4 and X11R5 , too . DISPLAY The name of the X Windows Display to use :0.0 ( on the local machine , the one actually running X11 or xnews ) :0.1 ( on some machines for a second , monochrome screen ) machine-running-unix:0.0 ( on other machines ) ( You may need to do `` xhost +other-machine '' to let programs on other machines use your display ; see also under Trouble Shooting , and see the section on xauth in the OpenWindows Version 3 Programmer 's Guide , pp . 101ff ) See also : console messages , under Trouble Shooting FONTPATH Where xnews searches for fonts /usr/openwin/lib/fonts ( you can also use `` xset fp+ dir '' to add a directory to the font path , but you may have to do `` xset fp rehash '' afterwards . This is fine under OpenWindows , but many X11 servers have font problems ) HELPPATH Where XView looks when you press the Help key ( or F1 ) /usr/openwin/lib/locale : /usr/openwin/lib/help ( On SunOS 4.0 . * , or with OpenWindows 2.0 , omit the first entry , which is for sites using a local other than `` C '' or `` USA '' ) . LD_LIBRARY_PATH Where to look to find shared C libraries /usr/lib : /usr/5lib : /usr/openwin/lib : /usr/CC/ ` arch ` ( the /usr/CC/ ` arch ` /lib entry is only needed if you use C++ programs ) OPENWINHOME Where OpenWindows lives /usr/openwin KEYBOARD , MOUSE -- serial devices to use instead of the console ( do n't set these for normal use ; /dev/kbd and /dev/mouse ) PATH Where the Shell searches for programs to run $ ( OPENWINHOME ) /bin : $ ( OPENWINHOME ) /bin/xview : /usr/local/bin : .\ $ HOME/bin. ` arch ` : /usr/ucb : /usr/bin : /usr/bin/X11 : /usr/hosts : \ ( you will certainly want to change this example ! There is no $ ( OPENWINHOME ) /bin/xview in OpenWindows 3.0 ) XFILESEARCHPATH Where programs look for app-defaults files /usr/openwin/lib/ % T/ % N % S ( This is set automatically by `` openwin '' in OpenWindows 3.0 ) You might want to use /usr/lib/X11/ % T/ % N % S , or perhaps both , separated with a : , for example ( for sh users ) XFILESEARCHPATH= $ OPENWINHOME/lib/ % T/ % N % S : /usr/lib/X11/ % T/ % N % S export XFILESEARCHPATH If you use X11R5 , you might instead want /usr/lib/X11/ % L/ % T/ % N % C % S : /usr/lib/X11/ % l/ % T/ % N % C % S : /usr/lib/X11/ % T/ % N % C % S : /usr/lib/X11/ % L/ % T/ % N % S : /usr/lib/X11/ % l/ % T/ % N % S : /usr/lib/X11/ % T/ % N % S : $ OPENWINHOME/lib/ % T/ % N % S ( put all this on one line , though , with no spaces ! ) Together with the following in lib/Xinitrc xrdb -merge < < 'END_XRDB' *customization : END_XRDB xrdb -merge < < 'END_XRDB' # ifdef COLOR *customization : -color # endif END_XRDB you automatically get a color oclock , editres , bitmap , xcalc , and xlogo since they use the `` *customization '' resource appearing as % C in the XFILESEARCHPATH .

XView 3.0 is available by anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu and elsewhere . MoOLIT can be bought from AT & T in source form . OpenWindows can be obtained from Sun , or you can get the source from Interactive Systems Inc . It is also included in some vendors ' System V Release 4 implementations , although that 's not always the latest version . The current release of OpenWindows from Sun for supported architectures is 3.0 ; for the Sun 3 series it is frozen at OpenWindows 2.0 . Note that Sun includes OpenWindows with SunOS , and it is also included as the windowing system for Solaris . There are said ( by Sun ) to be over 35 ports of OpenWindows either available now or in progress . Unfortunately , none of them seem to be available from anywhere .

From : vaughan @ ewd.dsto.gov.au ( Vaughan Clarkson ) Subject : Connecting a digitiser to X ( REPOST ) Organization : Defence Science and Technology Organisation , Salisbury , South Australia Lines : 32 NNTP-Posting-Host : caesar.dsto.gov.au Hi there ( I posted this to comp.windows.x.intrinsics but got no response , so I 'm posting here . ) I 'm wanting to connect a digitiser made for PCs into my workstation ( an HP 720 ) . It is my understanding the X windows can understand a variety of input devices including digitiser tablets . However , this digitiser makes use of the serial port , so there would seem to be a need to have a special device driver . The HP manual pages say that the HP X server will accept X input from devices listed in the /usr/lib/X11/X*devices file ( * = display number ) . I should n't think I would be able to simply insert /dev/rs232c as an input device in this file and expect a digitiser to work . But maybe I 'm wrong . Am I ? What I would like to know is : does anybody out there have a digitiser connected to their workstation for use as a pointer for X ( rather than just as input to a specific X application ) ? If so , what were the steps required for installation ? Did you need a special device driver ? Did the manufacturer supply it ? Are there generic public domain device drivers around ? ( I understand that digitisers generally use only a couple of standard formats . ) Any help would be greatly appreciated .

That 's not the same as MSW3.1 being objectively inferior . No . It is technically inferior to the OS/GUIs that I listed . I have already described why .

NeXTSTep -- easier to learn , use , and program . More stable multitasking UNIX/X -- As easy to learn and use . More stable multitasking . With the prpoer setup , all of these will exchange data with MSW machines as well as MSW machines will amongst themselves , so interoperability is not an issue . By this criterion , it is inferior .

All opinions , benchmarks , > > > recommendations , etc . are welcome . The Civic does still come in a 4 door model . My wife and I looked quite seriously at the 626 , Prizm ( Corolla ) , and Civic , as well as some other cars . Our impressions : all three seemed well built and had the features we wanted - these are similar to the features you want except for cruise control , and we want a manual transmission and are considering anti-lock brakes . I also hate automatic seatbelts and we both think having an airbag is a plus . In general , comfort and performance were both significant . Some specific + 's and - 's are listed below . Mazda 626 + very comfortable and roomy + can theoretically get ABS on DX model , though in practice this is hard to find + base price for base model includes numerous little things like : tach , variable speed wipers , rear defroster , 60/40 split folding rear seat - more expensive than many other cars listed below Honda Civic + DX gets significantly better mileage than other cars listed here + comfortable front seat + adjustable seat belt mounting - no ABS without EX model ( includes $ 1000 's of other things like a sunroof ) Geo Prizm/Toyota Corolla - seats not very comfortable to us ( your mileage may vary ) + adjustable seat belt mounting + can get ABS without lots of other extras Saturn + SL2 was quite comfortable , though SL1 less so - motorized attack belts Dodge Spirit no real outstanding + 's , but seemed generally ok - rear seat does not fold down Chevy Corsica + comes with ABS standard - lower `` would you buy that car again '' and safety ratings in Consumer Reports ( than first 3 cars above ) - suspension did n't feel as stiff as the others ( this would be a + for some ) The Honda Accord and Toyota Camry were both more expensive than the 626 , and in our minds , not significantly better . We probably gave disproportionately low consideration to the `` big 3 '' , due ( a ) to my wife 's family 's general dislike of Chrysler products , ( b ) some unimpressive GM products owned by my parents and a housemate of mine ( c ) the Taurus comes with automatic transmission , I find the seat of the Tempo very uncomfortable , and the escort has attack belts and no air bag . We 'll probably end up with a 626 - I saw a 626 DX with A/C and cassette advertised for just under $ 12800 ( Washington Post , April 14 , I think ) , and my local dealer says they can match that price . I will probably get the 626 ( maybe tomorrow ) . The main question in my mind is whether or not I will have to do a `` factory order '' or `` preference order '' to get one with ABS , and whether or not the dealership will run the price up a lot if I do so .

AFTER , watching me go through a couple contractions , the anes ( or anus as I like to refer to him ) said , `` Well , I am off duty now . '' ( still staring between my legs at that ) . The OB asked to go call whomever it was who was on duty and ask him/her how long it would take ... and if it was going to take more than a few minutes , to please stay even though he was off duty . The anes . went out , supposedly to call the on-call anes . In a couple of minutes the nurse came running in to tell the OB that the anes . had left without even trying to get ahold of the on-call . It was the only time during my labor that I swore . The on-call anes . took 20 minutes to get there . Come to find out , the anes . had only just gone off duty ( about 2 minutes before ) and technically was supposed to stay in the hospital until the next on-call got there . Good thing for all of us ( especially him ) that it was not a critical emergency . But boy would I love to knock that fellow 's ouchie places ... just to let him be in pain a few little minutes . I have run into `` Dr. Idiots '' , `` Mechanic Idiots '' , `` Clerk Idiots '' and `` Etc . Idiots '' in my time , but this fellow I would like to have words with . Deantha

That 's something I certainly look > for and which can be had in inexpensive cars . If you _really_ want to add safety to _any_ car , simply add a cage to the car . They are available and cheap ( about $ 500 in the USA ) . Add to that four or five or six point belts and you will walk away from collisions that were otherwise not survivable . but instead of people spending a little extra money , we get legislation that says the gov't must mandate a minimal level of protection for everyone . One other significant factor in improving one 's own safety is to get some training . This will improve your safety more than any other single investment will . Drive/ride defensively ( and that does not mean you have to be a doddering old stick in the mud ) . People here tend to enthuse about autos more than the average ( probably in the top 15th percentile in driving ability ) , but still we sometimes overlook the obvious . I 've been to two driving schools , and three riding schools for my motorcycle . A very worthwhile investment ( and besides , it was a lot of fun too ; - ) . Safety is what you make of it , just because a carmaker does n't provide you with an adequate level of protection does n't mean you have to leave it go at that . -- Al Bowers DOD # 900 Alfa Ducati Hobie Kottke 'blad Iaido NASA '' Well goodness sakes ... do n't you know that girls ca n't play guitar ?

I had sort of the same reaction myself when I was first realizing I was bi . `` So what , > 90 % of everyone else is straight , I 'd never end up with a guy anyway . '' As several people on soc.bi pointed out to me , this is true only if you find partners ( for relationships or just for sex ) in primarily straight circles . Nowadays with gay culture quite visible in major cities and such , you can easily find yourself in an overwhelmingly queer social circle if you so choose . ( About half my friends are bi , and that 's just from hanging out in the science fiction club and going to UCBU once a week , it 's not as if I have to go out of my way and hang out in bars or something . ) So the available pool for dates can be the same size . Unless of course you 're trying to date a random sample of the US population . As for promiscuity , I 've traded email with Clayton on the topic , and he still does n't seem to want to admit that yes , gay males are sometimes forced to resort to anonymous sex because they're closeted and ca n't afford to be seen in a permanent relationship . Or that part of the promiscuity is because of the messed-up gender roles in our society , and when males are dating males and they've *all* been trained to be the aggressor in sex , there 's going to be more sex . Or that what 's `` dysfunctional '' , what 's `` screwed up '' is societal attitudes , not gay sexuality , and that 's what encourages deviant behavior in gay males . ( also note that just because someone 's had 200 sex partners does n't mean they 're promiscuous . yes , it sounds ridiculous , but it 's quite possible for someone to go through a heavily closeted phase in which they have lots of anonymous sex with strangers , and then come out , start forming real relationships , and be monogamous or nearly so ... ) -- ____ Alan Jaffray ( jaffray @ math.uchicago.edu ) Email , 'talk ' always welcome . \bi/ Those who dance are thought mad by those who hear not the music -- Anon \/ B0H7f-t+w-cg+ ( + ) k+ ? s-vm-h-pS6/3bgz-++o-x-v+j+N0178l -- +a ( + ) f-vn- ( ++ ) e -- +dvb+u+

Lewis ( faq % craft @ uunet.uu.net ) maintains the informative and well written `` comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions '' document . Its focus is on general X information , while this FAQ concentrates on performance . The comp.windows.x FAQ does address the issue of speed , but only with regards to the X server . The gist of that topic seems to be : '' Use X11R5 , it is faster than R4 '' . ( Please see the X FAQ for complete details ) . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Window Managers -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - There are a lot of window managers out there , with lots of different features and abilities . The choice of which to use is by necessity a balancing act between performance and useful features . At this point , most respondents have agreed upon `` twm '' as the best candidate for a speedy window manager . A couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger , is turning off unnecessary things like `` zooming '' and `` opaque move '' . Also , if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner , you reduce the amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping windows . Joe English ( joe @ trystero.art.com ) I 've found that a good font for tiling is 7x13 ( aka : -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal -- 13-100-100-100-c-70-iso8859-1 ) . It is the biggest font I know of that I can use on my Sun ( 1152x900 screen ) and still get two 80 column terminal windows side-by-side on the display with no overlap . Other font suggestions will be accepted . -- -- -- -- -- -- The X Server -- -- -- -- -- -- Which Server ? - - - - - - - Make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware . If you have a monochrome monitor , use a monochrome X11 server . On my Monochrome Sun , I have n't noticed much difference between the Xsun ( colour ) server and XsunMono , however it was pointed out to me that XsunMono is about 800k smaller and therefore should contribute to less paging . [ thanks to : Jonny Farringdon ( j.farringdon @ psychol.ucl.ac.uk ) , Michael Salmon ( Michael.Salmon @ eos.ericsson.se ) ] How your server was compiled can also make a difference . Jeff Law ( law @ schirf.cs.utah.edu ) advises us that on a Sun system , X should be compiled with gcc ( version 2 . * ) or with the unbundled Sun compiler . You can expect to get `` *very* large speedups in the server '' by not using the bundled SunOS compiler . I assume that similar results would occur if you used one of the other high-quality commercial compilers on the market . Locking the Server into RAM ? - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Has anyone tried hacking the X server so that it is locked into RAM and does not get paged ? eg : via a call to plock ( ) . Does this help performance at all ? I 've had one inquiry on this topic , and a few pointers to the plock ( ) function call , but no hard evidence from someone who 's tried it . I am not in a position to give it a try . [ thanks to : Eric C Claeys ( ecc @ eperm.att.com ) , Danny Backx ( db @ sunbim.be ) , Juan D. Martin ( juando @ cnm.us.es ) ] Starting your Server - - - - - - - - - - - Joe English ( joe @ trystero.art.com ) : If you start up a lot of clients in your .xsession or whatever , sleep for a second or two after launching each one . After I changed my .xclients script to do this , logging in actually took *less* time ... we have a heavily loaded system without much core , though . This sounds crazy , but I have confirmed that it works ! Warner Losh ( imp @ Solbourne.COM ) provided me with a good explanation of why this works , which I have summarized here : When you start up an X server it takes a huge amount of time to start accepting connections . A lot of initialization is done by the server when it starts . This process touches a large number of pages . Any other process running at the same time would fight the server for use of the CPU , and more importantly , memory . If you put a sleep in there , you give the Server a chance to get itself sorted out before the clients start up . Similarly , there is also a lot of initialization whenever an X client program starts : toolkits registering widgets , resources being fetched , programs initializing state and `` databases '' and so forth . All this activity is typically memory intensive . Once this initialization is done ( `` The process has reached a steady state '' ) , the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages . By using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your .Xinitrc , you avoid them fighting each other for your workstation 's limited resources This is most definitely a `` Your Mileage May Vary '' situation , as there are so many variables to be considered : available RAM , local swap space , load average , number of users on your system , which clients you are starting , etc . Currently in my .xinitrc I have a situation like : ( sleep 1 ; exec xclock ) & ( sleep 1 ; exec xbiff ) & ( sleep 1 ; exec xterm ) & ( sleep 1 ; exec xterm ) & I 've experimented with : ( sleep 1 ; exec xclock ) & ( sleep 2 ; exec xbiff ) & ( sleep 3 ; exec xterm ) & ( sleep 4 ; exec xterm ) & I 've even tried : ( sleep 2 ; exec start_X_clients_script ) & and then in start_X_clients_script I had : ( sleep 1 ; exec xclock ) & ( sleep 1 ; exec xbiff ) & ( sleep 1 ; exec xterm ) & ( sleep 1 ; exec xterm ) & [ The idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had completely finished processing my .xinitrc , and had settled down into a `` steady state '' before the sleep expired and all my clients were launched . ] All of these yielded fairly comparable results , and so I just stuck with my current setup , for its simplicity . You will probably have to experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you . Fonts - - - Loading fonts takes time and RAM . If you minimize the number of fonts your applications use , you 'll get speed increases in load-up time . One simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts ( one small , one large , one roman , whatever suits you ) and configure all your clients -- or at least all your heavily used clients -- to use only those few fonts . Client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded into the server . This will also conserve server resources , since fewer fonts will be loaded by the server . [ Farrell McKay ( fbm @ ptcburp.ptcbu.oz.au ) , Joe English ( joe @ trystero.art.com ) ] eg : My main xterm font is 7x13 , so I also have twm set up to use 7x13 in all it 's menus and icons etc . Twm 's default font is 8x13 . Since I do n't normally use 8x13 , I 've eliminated one font from my server . Oliver Jones ( oj @ roadrunner.pictel.com ) : Keep fonts local to the workstation , rather than loading them over nfs . If you will make extensive use of R5 scalable fonts , use a font server . About the Resources File - - - - - - - - - - - - - Keep your .Xresources / .Xdefaults file small . Saves RAM and saves on server startup time . Joe English ( joe @ trystero.art.com ) One suggestion : In your .Xdefaults ( .Xresources ) file , try putting only the minimum number of resources that you want to have available to all of your applications . For example : *reverseVideo : true Then , separate your resources into individual client-specific resource files . For example : $ HOME/lib/app-defaults . In your .login file set the environment variable XUSERFILESEARCHPATH : setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH $ HOME/lib/app-defaults/ % N [ The `` comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions '' FAQ contains an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work . -- ed . ] So , when xterm launches , it loads its resources from ... /app-defaults/XTerm . Xdvi finds them in ... /app-defaults/XDvi , and so on and so forth . Note that not all clients follow the same XXxxx resource-file naming pattern . You can check in your system app-defaults directory ( often : /usr/X11R5/lib/X11/app-defaults/ ) to find the proper name , and then name your personal resource files with the same name . This is all documented in the Xt Specification ( pg 125 & 666 ) . [ Thanks to : Kevin Samborn ( samborn @ mtkgc.com ) , Michael Urban ( urban @ cobra.jpl.nasa.gov ) , and Mike Long ( mikel @ ee.cornell.edu ) . Kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers . ] This method of organizing your personal resources has the following benefits : - Easier to maintain / more usable . - Fewer resources are stored in the X server in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property . As a side benefit your server may start fractionally quicker , since it doesn ` t have to load all your resources . - Applications only process their own resources , never have to sort through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them . It also has drawbacks : - the application that you are interested in has to load an additional file every time it starts up . This does n't seem to make that much of a performance difference , and you might consider this a huge boon to usability . If you are modifying an application 's resource database , you just need to re-run the application without having to `` xrdb '' again . - xrdb will by default run your .Xdefaults file through cpp . When your resources are split out into multiple resource files and then loaded by the individual client programs , they will not . WATCH OUT FOR THIS ! ! I had C style comments in my .Xdefaults file , which cpp stripped out . When I switched to this method of distributed resource files I spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why my clients were not finding their resources . Xt did *NOT* provide any error message when it encountered the C style comments in the resource files , it simply , silently , aborted processing the resource file . The loss of preprocessing ( which can be very handy , e.g . `` # ifdef COLOR '' ... ) is enough to cause some people to dismiss this method of resource management . - You may also run into some clients which break the rules . For example , neither Emacs ( 18.58.3 ) nor Xvt ( 1.0 ) will find their resources if they are anywhere other than in .Xdefaults . - when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files with the machine where your resources are stored , your client will not find its resources . Loading all your resources into the server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find their resources . Casey Leedom ( casey @ gauss.llnl.gov ) A possible compromise suggestion that I have ( and am planning on trying ) is to put resources for all my heavily used clients ( eg : xterm ) into my .Xdefaults file , and to use the `` separate resources files '' method for clients that I seldom use . Define Your Display Properly - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server . In that situation , rather than setting your DISPLAY environment variable to `` < hostname > :0.0 '' , where < hostname > is the name of your workstation , you should set your DISPLAY variable to `` unix:0.0 '' or `` :0.0 '' . By doing this you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests . [ thanks to Patrick J Horgan ( pjh70 @ ras.amdahl.com ) ] See the _DISPLAY NAMES_ section of the X ( 1 ) man page for further explanation of how to properly set your display name . `` I do n't think it 's stock MIT , but ( at least ) Data General and HP have libraries that are smart enough to use local communication even when the DISPLAY is n't set specially . '' Rob Sartin ( 88opensi ! sartin @ uunet.UU.NET ) [ Jody Goldberg ( jody @ algorithmics.com ) sent me an Xlib patch to change stock R5 to use local communication even if DISPLAY is not properly set . I do n't want to get in the business of distributing or trying to juggle non-MIT patches and so have elected not to include it here . Hopefully MIT will apply this minor ( ~8 lines ) patch themselves . In the meantime , if you want to try it yourself , email Jody . -- ed . ] -- -- -- - Clients -- -- -- - If you only have a few megabytes of Ram then you should think carefully about the number of programs you are running . Think also about the _kind_ of programs you are running . For example : Is there a smaller clock program than xclock ? Unfortunately , I have n't really noticed that programs advertise how large they are , so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word . [ Suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients ( eg : Xclock , Xterm , Xbiff ) are welcome . -- ed . ] I 've received some contradictory advice from people , on the subject of X client programs . Some advocate the use of programs that are strictly Xlib based , since Xt , Xaw and other toolkits are rather large . Others warn us that other applications which you are using may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries . In this case , using a non-Xt ( for example ) client program may actually _increase_ the amount of RAM consumed . The upshot of all this seems to be : Do n't mix toolkits . That is , try and use just Athena clients , or just Xview clients ( or just Motif clients , etc ) . If you use more than one , then you 're dragging in more than one toolkit library . Know your environment , and think carefully about which client programs would work best together in that environment .

If you must use xterm , you can try reducing the number of saveLines to reduce memory usage .

I 've heard that there are versions of xvt with this feature , but I 've not found any yet . UPDATE ( March 1993 ) : I recently had a few email conversations with Brian Warkentin ( brian.warkentine @ eng.sun.com ) regarding xvt . He questions whether xvt really is at all faster than xterm . For instance , xvt may initialize slightly faster , but compare scrolling speed ( try this quickie benchmark : /bin/time dd if=/etc/termcap bs=40 ) and see which program can scroll faster . Also , while xterm may be slightly larger in RAM requirements ( We do n't have any hard numbers here , does anyone else ? ) shared libraries and shared text segments mean that xterm 's paging requirements are not that major . As an experiment , he ripped out all the tek stuff from xterm , but it made little difference , since if you never use it , it never gets brought into memory . So here we stand with some conflicting reports on the validity of xvt over xterm . In summary ? Caveat Emptor , your mileage may vary . If you can provide some hard data , I 'd like to see it .

From Scott Barman ( scott @ asd.com ) comes a suggestion regarding Motif Text Field Widgets : I noticed that during data entry into Motif text field widgets , I was getting a slight lag in response to some keystrokes , particularly the initial one in the field . Examining the what was going on with xscope I found it . It seems that when the resource XmNblinkRate is non-zero and the focus is on a text field widget ( or even just a text widget ) the I-beam cursor will blink . Every time the cursor appears or disappears in those widgets , the widget code is making a request to the server ( CopyArea ) . The user can stop this by setting the resource XmNblinkRate to 0 . It is not noticeable on a 40MHz SPARC , but it does make a little difference on a [ slower system ] . This specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots of areas . Consider your heavily used clients , are there any minor embellishments that can be turned off and thereby save on Server requests ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Miscellaneous Suggestions -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Pretty Pictures - - - - - - - - Do n't use large bitmaps ( GIF 's , etc ) as root window backgrounds . - The more complicated your root window bitmap , the slower the server is at redrawing your screen when you reposition windows ( or redraw , etc ) - These take up RAM , and CPU power . I work on a Sun SPARC and I'm conscious of performance issues , I ca n't comprehend it when I see people with a 4mb Sun 3/60 running xphoon as their root window . I 'll let someone else figure out how much RAM would be occupied by having a full screen root image on a colour workstation . - If you 're anything like me , you need all the screen real estate that you can get for clients , and so rarely see the root window anyway .

I use `` xset m 3 10 '' in my .xinitrc file , which lets me send my pointer across the screen with just a flick of the wrist . See the xset man page for further ideas and information . Hint : sometimes you may want to *slow down* your mouse tracking for fine work . To cover my options , I have placed a number of different mouse setting commands into a menu in my window manager . e.g .

Some that stick out : - For Motif programs , do n't set XmFontList resources for individual buttons , labels , lists , et . al . ; use the defaultFontList or labelFontList or whatever resource of the highest-level manager widget . Again , stick to as few fonts as possible . - Better yet , do n't use Motif at all . It 's an absolute pig . - Do n't create and destroy widgets on the fly . Try to reuse them . ( This will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits , too . ) - Use a line width of 0 in GCs . On some servers this makes a HUGE difference . - Compress and collapse multiple Expose events . This can make the difference between a fast application and a completely unusable one . Francois Staes ( frans @ kiwi.uia.ac.be ) : Just a small remark : I once heard that using a better malloc function would greatly increase performance of Xt based applications since they use malloc heavily . They suggested trying out the GNUY malloc , but I did n't find the time yet . I did some tests on small programs just doing malloc and free , and the differences were indeed very noticeable ( somewhat 5 times faster ) [ Any confirmation on this from anyone ? -- ed . ] Andre ' Beck ( Andre_Beck @ IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de ) : - Unnecessary NoExpose Events . Most people use XCopyArea/XCopyPlane as fastest blit routines , but they forget to reset graphics_exposures in the GC used for the blits . This will cause a NoExpose Event every blit , that , in most cases , only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to run through it 's event-loop again and again . - Thousands of XChangeGC requests . This `` Gfx Context Switching '' is also seen in most handcoded X-Apps , where only one or few GCs are created and then heavily changed again and again . Xt uses a definitely better mechanism , by caching and sharing a lot of GCs with all needed parameters . This will remove the load of subsequent XChangeGC requests from the connection ( by moving it toward the client startup phase ) . Say What ! ? - - - - - - Some contributors proposed ideas that seem right off the wall at first : David B. Lewis ( by day : dbl @ osf.org , by night : david % craft @ uunet.uu.net ) : How about this : swap displays with someone else .

Not really a major problem , except that the X11 client and the server are in absolute synchronicity and are context thrashing . Timothy H Panton ( thp @ westhawk.uucp ) : Firstly it relies on the fact that most CPU 's are mostly idle , X's cpu usage is bursty . so the chances of you and your teammate doing something cpu-intensive at the same time is small . If they are not then you get twice the cpu+memory available for your action . The second factor is that context switches are expensive , using 2 cpu 's halves them , you pay a price due to the overhead of going over the network , but this is offset in most cases by the improved buffering of a network ( typically 20k vs 4k for a pipe ) , allowing even fewer context switches . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Other Sources of Information -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Volume 8 in O'Reilly 's X Window System Series , `` X Window System Administrator 's Guide '' is a book all X administrator 's should read .

Kent , with regards to the information contained in the Bible ( which is the original context of this thread ) , Brian Kendig is inside a huge wall . Brian *IS* inside . The Bible and the information contained therein are outside the wall . Brian Kendig proves this very sad fact by the absurd things he says . For example , `` If I get through into the firey pit , I will cease to exist . '' The Bible does n't say that . He hasn't a clue even to what Jesus said about hell . That is but one example . Now in your sense , Kent , of sensing reality -- that is a different matter . And to you and to Brian , relativity does play a big role . What we perceive to be true , depends on our vantage point . Since I have read the Bible , and Brian Kendig shows that he has n't , he has a narrower perspective than mine ( at least in the respect of knowledge of the Bible ) . I am proposing to Brian , `` Brian , come up here and take a look from this vantage point . '' But Brian replies , `` I rather not thank you . I am content where I am . Besides , the vista from up there stinks . '' And in the meanwhile , Brian ignores the facts that he has never up there nor does he realize I had shared the same plateau where Brian now stands .

This brings up another something I have never understood . I asked this once before and got a few interesting responses , but somehow did n't seem satisfied . Why would the NT NOT be considered a good source . This might be a literary/historical question , but when I studied history I always looked for firsthand original sources to write my papers . If the topic was on Mr. X , I looked to see if Mr. X wrote anything about it . If the topic was on a group , look for the group , etc . If the topic is on Mr. X , and Mr. X did not write anything about it , ( barring the theistic response about the Bible being divinely inspired which I ca n't adequately argue ) , would n't we look for people who ate , worked , walked , talked , etc . with him ? If someone was at an event would n't they be a better `` reporter '' than someone who heard about it second hand ? I guess is n't firsthand better than second hand . I know , there is bias , and winners writing history , but does n't the principle of firsthand being best still apply ?

While the Second is under enough > attack for guarrentteing our rights to fire arms , perhaps we > should reflect on this as well . ( Perhaps fire arms are not the > only weapons covered under the Second Amendment ) Hmmm ... I would n't consider encryption to be a weapon . How would the government classify encryption ? Seems to me that encryption ought to be covered by the first amendment . Using this line of reasoning , the government should n't be able to restrict what data people encrypt and what encryption algorithms they use because this would be restricting one 's freedom of speech . In other words , encrypted data -- -text , graphics , or other information -- -is just another form of free speech . For this reason the government should n't be able to regulate the use of encryption algorithms and encrypted data . The only time the government should be able to 'force ' someone to reveal his or her encryption keys for some encrypted data is when the encrypted data in question may be something that is n't protected by the first amendment such as kiddy porn . Even in a case like this the government should be required to get a search warrant before coercing someone into revealing the keys . BTW , what encryption methods are considered to be state-of-the-art nowdays . Have the feds relaxed export restrictions on DES yet ? Also , is DES still regarded as a good form of encryption ? > Robert Johnston > johonston @ cyberia.win.net Scott Kennedy , Brewer and Patriot Before : `` David Koresh is a cheap thug who interprets the Bible through the barrel of a gun ...

The Apocryphal books that are in the Septuagint were part of the canon used by the Greek-speaking churches from the inception of the church . They were not added later ( or much later ) .

Although I do n't want to muddy the waters unnecessarily I disagree . Any discrimination based on religion is not and can not be racist unless the sole qualification for religious membership is racial . This is not the case for Israel although it might get a little closer than , say , Islam . This of course raises the vexed question of Church AntiSemitism . Jews have been heavily discriminated against on the grounds of religion in many Christian countries . If we take Russia as an example Jews were seriously persecuted but that persecution in the eyes of the Church and State stopped at the baptismal font . Officially anyway . If a Jew converted there were no legal barriers in his way ( that I know of anyway . ) Peter the Great 's Interior Minister came from such a convert background . Can we then claim that the Russian Orthodox did not teach AntiSemitism and was not AntiSemitic ? Similarly for the Roman Catholic Church ? I suspect so as this is not a racial 'taint ' but one based on belief and AS is after all a form of racism . Well maybe not . What is AntiSemitism then if not something racially based ? I wonder if Hitler killed converts of 'pure ' German blood . Does anyone know one way or the other ?

Currently a cracker needs to find the _only_ ( *1 ) key that produces the given ciphertext . He has to try about 2^63 keys on the average . In the proposed method the cracker only needs _any pair_ of key halves . If he can store about 2^32 guesses for one half , he is likely to find a mathching pair in about 2^32 guesses . ( Here I have assumed that the DES-encryption is reversable , if the key is guessed . Is this so or do the modifications of the S-boxes by the salt bits make it non-reversable ? ) *1 Probably there is only one key ; I think there is 1 chance in about 128 that there are two or more keys ( can anyone verify this ? ) , but this doesn't help the cracker much .

Hm . I get a little queasy around the phrase `` are n't morally responsible '' , perhaps because I 've heard it misused so many times . ( I remember in college some folk trying to argue that a person who was drunk was not morally responsible for his actions . ) In general , most folk ca n't control their dreams , but perhaps what you do all day and think about has some impact on them , hm ? And I 'm not sure what '' actions '' are in a dream . But I will note that Jesus does seem adamant about the fact that our thought-life is at least as important as our actions . Go lightly with this argument - we are all morally responsible for *who we are* and dreams might well be an important part of that . > Now , there seem to be 3 alternatives : > 1 ) Dreams and OOBEs are totally mental phenomena . In this case no morality > applies beyond what might be called 'mental hygiene ' , that is , not trying > to think about anything evil , or indulgining in overly sexy or violent > thoughts . I do n't know a thing about Out Of Body Experiences . I 've had dreams , some fairly vivid ones ; is an OOBE just a very vivid dream ? I would argue that extreme interest in this sort of phenomena is a tad risky ; it is probably much better to think about who Jesus is , and who we are in relation to that , than to cultivate a strong interest in dreams . Unless you feel plagued by dreams that are painful and out of control ; then pray about it and/or get help . > 2 ) Dreams and OOBEs have a reality of their own ( i.e . are 'another plane ' ) > Evidence for this is that often dreams and OOBEs are sometimes done in > common by more than one person . What on Earth is your definition of `` often '' ? I know exactly one case of two people who had substantially the same dream at the same time , and as they were brothers who had spent the day doing the same things I could see why their dreams might be similiar . Anyway , the only `` other plane '' I know of is the spiritual realm . I do n't think *anyone's* dreams , perhaps outside the occasional prophet 's , represent actual actions on an alternate plane . If they were real actions , or conscious thoughts , then yes they would have direct moral significance . > 3 ) Like ( 2 ) , but here we assume that [ garbled text : `` because the dream occurs in a different environment , then different moral laws apply '' is my guess of what you said . ] I do n't see the slightest hint in Christian writings that ones `` environment '' changes the way a person determines what is moral . For a Christian won't it *always* come down to `` what Jesus would have us do ? '' > So ... There it is . Is one of these cases the truth , or does anyone know > of another alternative ? respond by post or email . Truth ? I do n't claim to be an expert in dreams . I 'll note that the Bible does n't talk much about dreams outside of the realm of God using them to speak to us , with the caveat that such messages are not always very clear , as it warns somewhere in the OT . Given that , I would not give them a lot of attention unless you feel your dreams are trying to tell you something . I would discount talk of `` alternate planes , '' though . The only places such concepts are commonly bandied about are for the most part hostile to Christianity , though I 've run into the occasional exception . If you are , or want to be , a Christian , you want to be very careful about ideas like this .

The Catholic doctrine of predestination does not exclude free will in any way . Since God knows everything , He therefore knows everything that is going to happen to us . We have free will , and are able to change what happens to us . However , since God knows everything , He knows all the choices we will make `` in advance '' ( God is not subject to time ) . Too often arguments pit predestination against free will . We believe in both . - - - - - - - - - - Steve Creps , Indiana University creps @ lateran.ucs.indiana.edu

Thanks for the enlightening post . Is there a Technical Note on this ? The desktop machine I was referring to was actually not a Mac , but rather , any of various workstations that use the 68030 @ 25MHz , such as old Suns or old NeXTs . I used to own a NeXT 68030 cube . But I will try rebooting without extensions to see what kind of a speed difference I get with my powerbook Duo . I did notice an extreme slowdown to unusability with a Mac Plus after installing system 7 on it . Why does the OS suck up so much CPU power ? Also , you 're right -- software does make a HUGE difference . I have the misfortune of using MS-Works on my Duo . When editing relatively small ( 40K ) files , cut or copy takes several seconds , often more than 6 seconds ! ! This happens with power cycling turned off . As usual , MS software is maggot-infested feces . I 'm getting Nisus to replace it for my text editing . -Avery

From : REXLEX @ fnal.fnal.gov Subject : ARSENOKOITAI 2 -Bailey/Boswell Organization : FNAL/AD/Net Lines : 184 [ continuing with Dr. DeYoung 's article- ] SURVEY OF NEW INTERPRETATIONS OF ARSENOKOITAI D.S . Bailey D.S . Bailey was perhaps the trailblazer of new assessments of the meaning of arsenokoitai . He takes the term in I Cor 6:9 as denoting males who actively engage in homosexual acts , in contrast to malakoi ( `` effeminate '' ) , those who engage passively in such acts . *4 However , he insists that Paul knew nothing of `` inversion as an inherited trait , or an inherent condition due to psychological or glandular causes , and consequently regards all homosexual practice as evidence of perversion '' ( 38 ) . Hence Bailey limits the term's reference in Paul 's works to acts alone and laments modern translations of the term as `` homosexuals . '' Bailey wants to distinguish between `` the homosexual *condition* ( which is morally neutral ) and homosexual *practices* '' [ italics in source ] . Paul is precise in his terminology and Moffatt 's translation '' sodomites '' best represents Paul 's meaning in Bailey 's judgment ( 39 ) . Bailey clearly denies that the homosexual condition was known by biblical writers . J. Boswell The most influential study of arsenokoitai among contemporary authors is that of John Boswell . *5 Whereas the usual translation*6 of this term gives it either explicitly or implicitly an active sense , Boswell gives it a passive sense . In an extended discussion of the term ( 341-53 ) , he cites `` linguistic evidence and common sense '' to support his conclusion that the word means `` male sexual agents , i.e . active male prostitutes . '' His argument is that the arseno- part of the word is adjectival , not the object of the koitai which refers to base sexual activity . Hence the term , according to Boswell , designates a male sexual person or male prostitute . He acknowledges , however , that most interpret the composite term as active , meaning `` those who sleep with , make their bed with , men . '' Boswell bases his interpretation on linguistics and the historical setting . He argues that in some compounds , such as paidomathes ( `` child learner '' ) , the paido- is the subject of manthano , and in others , such as paidoporos ( `` through which a child passes '' ) , the paido- is neither subject nor object but simply a modifier without verbal significance . His point is that each compound must be individually analyzed for its meaning . More directly , he maintains that compounds with the Attic form arreno- employ it objectively while those with the Hellenistic arseno- use it as an adjective ( 343 ) . Yet he admits exceptions to this distinction regarding arreno- . Boswell next appeals to the Latin of the time , namely drauci or exoleti . These were male prostitutes having men or women as their objects . The Greek arsenokoitai is the equivalent of the Latin drauci ; the corresponding passive would be parakoitai ( `` one who lies beside '' ) , Boswell affirms . He claims that arsenokoitai was the `` most explicit word available to Paul for a male prostitute , '' since by Paul 's time the Attic words pornos ( `` fornicator '' ) and porneuon ( `` one committing fornication '' ) , found also in the LXX , had been adopted `` to refer to men who resorted to female prostitutes or simply committed fornication . `` *7 In the absence of the term from pagan writers such as Herodotus , Plato , Aristotle , and Plutarch , and from the Jewish writers Philo and Josephus , Boswell finds even more convincing evidence for his affirmation that arsenokoitai `` did not connote 'homosexual ' or even 'sodomite ' in the time of Paul '' ( 346 ) . *8 He also demonstrates its absence in Pseudo-Lucian , Sextus Empiricus , and Libanius . He subsequently finds it lacking in `` all discussions of homosexual relation '' ( 346 ) *9 among Christian sources in Greek , including the Didache , Tatian , Justin Martyr , Eusebius , *10 Clement of Alexandria , Gregory of Nyssa , and John Chrysostom . Chrysostom is singled out for his omission as `` final proof '' that the word could not mean homosexuality . *11 Boswell next appeals to the omission of the texts of I Cor and I Tim from discussions of homosexuality among Latin church fathers ( 348 ) . *12 Cited are Tertullian , Arnobius , Lactantius , and Augustine . The last named uses '' circumlocutions . '' Other Latin writers include Ausonius , Cyprian , and Minucius Felix . The term is also lacking in state and in church legislation . By the sixth century the term became confused and was applied to a variety of sexual activities from child molesting to anal intercourse between a husband and wife ( 353 ) . Having surveyed the sources , Boswell concludes , There is no reason to believe that either arsenokoitai or malakoi connoted homosexuality in the time of Paul or for centuries thereafter , and every reason to suppose that , whatever they came to mean , they were not determinative of Christian opinion on the morality of homosexual acts ( 353 ) . It is clear throughout that Boswell defines arsenokoitai to refer to male prostitutes . He even goes so far as to conclude that Paul would probably not disapprove of `` gay inclination , '' `` gay relationships , '' `` enduring love between persons of the same gender , '' or `` same-sex eroticism '' ( 112 , 166-17 ) . ________________________________________________________ 4 .

Again this would be expected if Paul coined the word . 9 . The key phrase here apparently is `` discussoin , '' for Boswell admits later ( 350 n.42 ) that it occurs in quotes of Paul but there is no discussion in the context . Hence the implication is that we can not tell what these writer ( Polycarp `` To the Philippian 5:3 '' ; Theophilus `` Ad Autolycum 1.2 , 2.14 '' ; Nilus '' Epistularum libri quattuor 2.282 '' ; Cyril of Alexandria `` Homiliae diversae 14 '' ; `` Sybilline Oravle 2.13 '' ) meant . Yet Polycarp , who was a disiple of Hohn the Apostle and died about A.D. 155 , argues in the context that young men should be pure . He uses only the three terms pornoi , malakoi , and arsenokoitai from Paul 's list . This at least makes Boswell 's use of `` all '' subjective . Apparently Clement of Alexandria `` Paedogogus 3.11 '' ; Sromata 3.18 '' ; also belong here . 10.. Yet Eusebius uses it in `` Demonstraionis evangelicae 1 . '' 11 . Either Boswell is misrepresenting the facts about Chrysostom 's use of arsenokoitai and its form ( about 20 ) in the vice lists of I Cor 6 or I Tim 1 , or he is begging the question by denying that the word can mean homosexual when Chrysostom uses it . Yet the meaning of arsenokoitai is the goal of his and our study , whether in the lists or other discussions . Boswell later admits ( 351 ) that Chrysostom uses the almost identicl form arsenokoitos in his commentary on I Cor . Although Boswell suggests that the passage is strange , it may be that Paul is seeking to make a refinement in arsenokoitai . 12 . Apparently Jerome is a significant omission here , since he renders arsenokoitai as `` masculorum concubitores , '' corresponding `` almost exactly to the Greek '' ( 348 n.36 ) . footnotes : _______________________ 5 .

We had a most peculiar little locomotive , originally built in America for the Russian Government , adapted to burn either wood or oil ; one covered truck as men 's quarters ; one similar , which I fitted up for my- self and a railway officer ; and also a truck to carry wood , three cars being the utmost our small engine could pull . With this small outfit we started , rumours of all kinds reaching us before our departure indicating that the whole situation was rapidly coming to a head , it being evident that the Turks were becoming~ more and more restive in the face of the inexplicable delay of the Allies in reaching any definite decision with regard to the future . Travelling on this little `` war-time '' railway was indeed an experience , and it was necessary to carry a `` gauge , '' and to test the rails with it frequently , for in many places , owing to the sinking of the embankments and the washing away of the ballast , the rails required rectification before we were able to get our train over , even at a foot pace ; each bridge also re- quired elaborate examination before adventuring the train upon it , and eventually we were obliged to carry large baulks of tim- ber to temporarily shore up many of the bridges and culverts whilst we passed over them . Under these circumstances it may be imagined that our prog- ress was by no means rapid , and as we had frequently to halt also to replenish our supply of wood fuel , we considered we had achieved wonders when , on the evening of the second day , 60 hours and 70 miles out from Erzeroum , we finally entered the gorge of the mountains where we understood our worst troubles to lie . This is the same gorge into which the road from Erzeroum to Kars descends from the foot-hills to cross the frontier ; the railway , however , follows the main Aras River val- ley till the frontier gorge enters it , whilst the road cuts off the corner and joins the rail again at the frontier post of Zivin , some 15 miles from the main valley . Soon after entering the gorge , we were confronted by the first serious fall of rock -- about 2,000 tons having fallen from the cliff face and entirely obliterated the railway track . Here , therefore , we halted , and , sending our engine back , prepared to -- David Davidian dbd @ urartu.sdpa.org | `` Armenia has not learned a lesson in S.D.P.A .

My experience is when they pound their fists on your back it means `` slow down '' . Seriously , concentrate on being very smooth , and you will make her experience much more enjoyable . Even a normal upshift causes your passenger to bob , so I ease off the throttle before pulling in the clutch to eliminate this . It 's more work , but your passenger will appreciate it ! Also , I 've found that using more rear brake than normal helps keep the bike from diving as much during routine stops , which makes it much easier for the passenger to hang on . If you 're going sport riding , have the passenger reach around you and brace themselves against the tank so you do n't have to bear both your weights with your arms .

I help it better to ask questions before I spout an opinion . We 've been progressing towards that goal for 30 years now . We precede any orbiting mission with flyby missions . Of course , it gets harder to do as we work our way farther away from Earth . We 're just starting to work out to the outer planets : Galileo will orbit Jupiter , and Cassini around Saturn . > How about a mission ( unmanned ) to Pluto to stay in orbit and record things > around and near and on Pluto.. Well first things first . We 'll do a flyby mission first since it is much easier and faster to do . If the Fast Pluto Flyby mission is approved then we 'll launch a Pluto mission before the end of the decade . A Pluto orbiter however requires a larger spacecraft and a longer cruise period . Orbit insertion requires more fuel has to be carried along and restricts the trajectory to a slower approach velocity to Pluto . I 'd imagine though that we would be doing a Neptune orbiting mission before a Pluto orbiting mission , unless the Pluto flyby turns up something really interesting . ___ _____ ___ /_ /| /____/ \ /_ /| Ron Baalke | baalke @ kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov | | | | __ \ /| | | | Jet Propulsion Lab | ___| | | | |__ ) |/ | | |__ M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand /___| | | | ___/ | |/__ /| Pasadena , CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and |_____|/ |_|/ |_____|/ | part vegetable .

Bit of a coincidence , that . Never lived out in the country I see . 4 years ago I had a place where I had to carry in propane every month , hook the bottle up to copper line , to supply both the stove , and a type of water- heater called a flash-heater . A flash heater has a pilot lamp . Here 's the point . If the Davidians had their propane tanks hooked up to copper ( or some such ) lines , run through the ceiling spaces -- when the FBI started wrecking the place , they could easily have ruptured the lines . Which then would start spreading out through the overhead . And since it was a country home , it was n't necessarily built with non-flamable insulation . It 's probably more plausible than anything else , that the fire started mainly as a result of accident -- or willful negligence on the part of the FBI , which should have known better ( ie . manslaughter ) .

Yes they did want to kill the inhabitants and many of them were killed . This is of course simple to resolve , the Haganah sent a soldier to report on the massacre . He brought a photographer with him . He sent in a report . The Israeli government suppressed it . Now the government was a Labour Government . Since then the Revisionists have gotten into power but for some reason Likud did n't release the report and its pictures either . Perhaps you might want to tell me why ? If it happened as you claim then there will be no pictures of men shot in the head with their hands tied behind their backs , no women and children shot as they slept . Yet for some reason they did not take the chance to clear their own name . You have a reason for this do n't you ? I somehow doubt it . The facts are exactly as the people responsible claim - a premeditated mass murder nothing else . No Iraqi soldiers , no other fighting . Just ethnic cleansing at work .

I am running Win 3.1 with NDW 2.2 on a 486sx with 8 meg of memory and a 6 meg perm swap file and am getting exceedingly frustrated that my applications are not giving back system resources when I close them . When I load windows I start with about 83 % resources available but many of the application programs I run regularly ( WPWIN 5.2 , VB 2.0 , WINQVT 2.8 , Lotus Organizer , etc . ) seem to not return all their resources when I exit them . After a day or two of work I often find myself down under 50 % of available resources even when I have no applications other than my shell running . I am aware this is a known problem ; what I am looking for are some suggestions of what I might do to mitigate it . 1 . What software is the culprit ? Win 3.1 , NDW , my applications ? Are some modes of Win 3.1 ( standard , real , enhanced ) better than others at plugging this leak ? 2 . Are their system.ini switches i can set to help plug this leak ? 3 . Do people know of patches or third party software that help with this ? Seems like increasing or better managing system resources is a great market for a third party memory company like QEMM . 4 . If I run Progman instead of NDW will the leak subside ? ( I was hoping that NDW 2.2 would have plugged this , but it seems no different than 2.0 in how it deals with memory and resources . ) 5 . When I am writing VB code are there things I can do to make it less likely my code will eat resources ? 6 . Any other suggestions that I do n't know enough to ask for specifically ? Thanks for your help .

Since I do n't think Tom always gets time to read this group , I 'll take the liberty of responding to some of this . If you really want Tom to reply you should send mail to support @ qdeck.com . A 64k line is certainly going to restrict you far more than the 10mbps ethernet that we typically run . How restrictive it will be depends on what you run and how you run it . I would think that a couple of instances of some really nasty program like `` Smoking Clover '' would make the link useless for anyone else . On the other hand , probably 50 xclocks quietly updating every 10 seconds or so would n't impact it too much . In the real world , you will be somewhere in between these two extremes . Going by the way I personally use X on a daily basis , I would n't want to have to share that 64k link with more than 3-4 other people . > > Having said that , if you can tweak the programs being run ( by adding > > in calls to give up time slices when idle and that sort of > > thing ) , you could probably run 15-20 people on a given machine before > > you started seeing slowdowns again ( this time from network bandwidth ) . > > Hmmm .

What size link do you have ( 2Mb or 10Mb ? ) . > What is the average traffic flow going through your network or do you > have few high peaks and then many low points ? Our corporate WAN is as unique as any other . The usage patterns are not very good predictors of how yours will behave . The only one of our low bandwidth links that normally get used in this way is a 56k link to Ireland that they often use to run a DOS text based client end of a client-server database remotely from the DVX machine behind me . Since the server end is ( or was ) always at this end ( California ) it is faster to remotely run the client via DESQview X and have a short hop to the server than running the client locally and having a long hop to the server . As I warned you , this tells us very little about how you usage pattern will fill a 64k ISDN link . Running Word for Windows remotely is going to itself be very usage dependent . Let 's break it into pieces and look at it . Tracking the mouse pointer is easy and efficient to translate from Windows calls into X. Popping up a menu is a little more involved and will generate some traffic . Restoring the screen that was covered by that menu may be easy and may not be . Does the server that it 's displaying on have backing store ? If so and the server had enough memory the display can be updated locally and will generate little network traffic . If no backing store , then what was being covered up ? If it was a solid colored rectangle of space we can tell your xserver to draw that quite easily . If it was a full color backdrop of Ren & Stimpy we may have to send it back to the X server bit by bit . DVX will do its level best to only redraw that small area , but in some unusual cases the entire screen may need to be repainted . Assuning a 1024x768 screen with 4 bits per pixel that 's 3145728 bits that has to be sent . Worst possible case you 're looking at about 50 seconds . In reality it would never be this bad since the screen will always have parts that will be tranlatable into higher level X calls . > > > > It all really depends on what the programs are doing ( ie . you 're going > > to see a slowdown from X-bandwidth a lot sooner if your apps are all > > doing network things also ... ) > > -- > > What do you mean by network things ?

X was designed from the ground up to be efficient across a network . It 's pretty good for this . X programs are best , DOS text programs are almost as good ( since we conert them to X easily ) . Something like WinX is a hybrid . We intercept the calls Windows makes to it 's graphics driver/ mouse driver keyboard driver and convert them to X . The calls Windows is making are in no way designed to be efficient on a packet switched network . We go to a lot of trouble to convert them to the highes level Xlib calls we can , but we are somewhat limited because we only know what Windows and its applications tell us . + -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- + | Quarterdeck Office Systems ____________________/_ | | Gary Rich - Problem Resolution Dept . _________________///__\ | | _____________________________________________ ______________/////___\ | | Anonymous FTP site = qdeck.com ___________///////____\ | | -- -For -- - -- -Write to -- - ________/////////_____\ | | Pricing/Ordering info : info @ qdeck.com _____///////////______\ | | Technical Questions : support @ qdeck.com __/////////////_______\ | | Quarterdeck BBS - ( 310 ) 314-3227 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ | + -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- +

Some of > them are used against us only through incredibly perverse interpretations . > Others simply do not address the issues . I can see that some of the above verses do not clearly address the issues , however , a couple of them seem as though they do not require `` incredibly perverse interpretations '' in order to be seen as condemning homosexuality . `` ... Do not be deceived ; neither fornicators , nor idolators , nor adulterers , nor effeminate , nor homosexuals , nor thieves , nor the covetous , nor drunkards , nor revilers , nor swindlers , shall inherit the kingdom of God . And such were some of you ... '' I Cor . 6:9-11 . Would someone care to comment on the fact that the above seems to say fornicators will not inherit the kingdom of God ? How does this apply to homosexuals ? I understand `` fornication '' to be sex outside of marriage . Is this an accurate definition ? Is there any such thing as same-sex marriage in the Bible ? My understanding has always been that the New Testament blesses sexual intercourse only between a husband and his wife . I am , however , willing to listen to Scriptural evidence to the contrary . `` You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female ; it is an abomination . Also you shall not have intercourse with any animal to be defiled with it , nor shall any woman stand before an animal to mate with it ; it is a perversion . '' Lev . 18:22-23 . I notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the verse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse . I know of no New Testament passages that clearly condemn , or even mention , intercourse with animals . Do those who argue for the legitimacy of homosexual intercourse believe that the Bible condemns bestiality as a perversion , and if so , why ? That is , what verses would you cite to prove that bestiality was perverted and sinful ? Could the verses you cite be refuted by interpreting them differently ? Can one be a Christian zoophile ? By the way , I myself am subject to sexual desires that I did not choose to have and that many people would regard as perverted and sinful , so please understand that I am not asking these questions out of an antipathy towards my fellow `` people of alternative orientations '' . I do believe , however , that one should read the Bible with an attitude of `` what is the Bible trying to say '' and not `` what do I WANT the Bible to say . '' I choose not to give in to my `` perverted '' sexual desires because I believe the Bible tries to tell me , whether I like it or not , that such things are sin . It is frustrating at times , and I have had days where it really got me down , but I do n't blame God for this , I blame the sin itself . - Mark [ There 's some ambiguity about the meaning of the words in the passage you quote . Both liberal and conservative sources seem to agree that '' homosexual '' is not the general term for homosexuals , but is likely to have a meaning like homosexual prostitute . That does n't meant that I think all the Biblical evidence vanishes , but the nature of the evidence is such that you ca n't just quote one verse and solve things . I think your argument from fornication is circular . Why is homosexuality wrong ? Because it 's fornication . Why is it fornication ? Because they 're not married . Why are n't they married ? Because the church refuses to do a marriage ceremony . Why does the church refuse to do a marriage ceremony ? Because homosexuality is wrong . In order to break the circle there 's got to be some other reason to think homosexuality is wrong . -- clh ]

From : dike @ scic.intel.com ( Charles Dike ) Subject : Re : Mormon Temples Organization : Intel Corporation , Beaverton , OR Lines : 44 From : dhammers @ pacific. ? ( David Hammerslag ) How do you ( Mormons ) reconcile the idea of eternal marriage with Christ 's statement that in the resurrection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage ( Luke , chapt . 20 ) ? Footnotes in some bibles reference this verse to the Book of Tobit . Tobit is in the Septuagint . Goodspeed published it in a book called '' The Apocrypha '' . Most any bookstore will have this . At any rate , the Jews of Christ 's day had this book . It is a story mostly centered around the son of Tobit who was named Tobias . There was a young lady , Sarah , who had entered the bridal chamber with seven brothers in succession . The brothers all died in the chamber before consumating the marriage . Tobias was entitled to have Sarah for his wife ( 3:17 ) because Tobias was her only relative and `` ... she was destined for [ Tobias ] from the beginning '' ( 6:17 ) . Tobias took her to wife and was able to consumate the marriage . The seven husbands would not have her as a partner in heaven . That does not eliminate Tobias , her eighth husband . Tobit is a fun and interesting story to read . It 's kind of a mythical romance . It 's a little shorter than Esther . The LDS also have scriptures that parallel and amplify Luke 20 . Most notably Doctrines and Covenants 132:15-16 . `` Therefore , if a man marry him a wife in the world , and he marry her not by me nor by my word , and he covenant with her so long as he is in the world and she with him , their covenant and marriage are not of force when they are dead , and when they are out of the world ; therefore , they are not bound by any law when they are out of the world . `` Therefore , when they are out of the world they neither marry nor are given in marriage ; but are appointed angels in heaven , which angels are ministering servants , to minister for those who are worthy of a far more , and an exceeding , and an eternal weight of glory .

There was at least one blast consistent with petroleum products that I saw , however propane is interesting stuff . It does n't explode on contact with air . It is *possible* for a tank to rupture without exploding . Far more likely , however , is that the compound was equipped with NG outlets running to the tank . Damage from the CEV 's could have ruptured the gas lines , allowing the gas to spread , unnoticed in the CS fumes and general excitement ( propane typically has a distinctive odor added to it for just this reason -- to smell leaks ) , until reaching a flame or spark , and then Whooosh !

Stay away from GEICO . A recent CAR & DRIVER issue has an article about GEICO giving free laser guns to police departments to increase they 're speed limit enforcement . The article also said that if you get a speeding ticket your premium will increase dramatically based on how much `` over the limit '' you were . If I remember correctly , at `` more than 20 over '' , you 'll get something like a 65 % increase . If you have a radar detector , you will be denied coverage or dropped immediately . One accident claim and you will be dropped . After many years with GEICO , my father who had 0 tickets and had made 0 claims , had an accident and filed an $ 800 claim . He was dropped immediately . Since then he has been with State Farm for years with no complaints . I have been with State Farm for about 20 years - no complaints . TRAVIS

All Muslims knew that the whole thing was set up to destroy Iraq , not to `` Liberate Kuwait '' , The people who were killed by the invasion are more ( many many more ) , than the ones that were killed by the Iraqis in their smaller invasion . I lived in the west , and I have seen how your media prepared you ( helpless naive Americans ) for a war against Iraq even before the artificial conflict between Iraq and Kuwait that led to the invasion , as the CIA correctly predicted ( and pretended to be surprised not to know ) . It just happened that Saddam was so predictible and so arrogant and stupid . What would I have done : Most Muslims would choose 300 dead Kuwaitis over 200,000 dead Iraqis and 1000 dead Kuwaitis . The first case would happen if no western intervention happened , and the second case was a direct or indirect result of western envolvement . Human rights in Kuwait ? what about human rights in Iraq ? why the west gave Saddam a green light to slaughter his own people ? I will give my reason : because the rich Kuwaitis do not mind to be your salves , so they deserve some democracy , but Iraqis might not , so they do n't .

Not necessarily the best solution , my view of an Islamic state ( and that of Turabi that your media made you hate ) includes all the benefits of a secular state minus the injustices . Did you ever read a book by Rashid Al-Ghannoushi ( Tunisia ) , Hassan Turabi ( Sudan ) ? You only know about them from your Self-censured , self-controlled media . If they make this kind of campaign against such a moderate thinker as Turabi is , and keep quite about such an extremist Muslim scholar as Bin Bez of Saudi Arabia is , it just does not encourage any moderation in our ARab world . > You make it sound like these guys are angels , Ilyess . ( In your > clarinet posting you edited out some stuff ; was it the following ? ? ? ) No it was not that , it was just some irrelevent stuff that I took out to go around the copyright ( ; - ) ) I ceased to take the Newyork times seriously . In issues concerning Islam it has become one of the biggest enemies ( although less than the other NewYork daily since Mortimer took it over ) . It lies , selects facts that fits its agenda and even prints racist and open anti-Muslim editorials . What they claimed in that articles is a bunch of lies because while the selected facts are true about some of those persons , the other members are actually defence lawyers and University science professors who wanted to fight corruption , uncover atrocities against opposition activists and Shia minority , and generally increase awareness about the rights of all citizens . The only thing that is common between those people is their concern for the deterioration of human rights since the Saudi clan took a green light from AMerica ( after the gulf ) to do whatever is necessary to stay in power . Do you know that ALL OF THE SAUDI ULEMA have been taught the same things ? the ones in the official Iftaa are as conservative as the ones that are opposing it . SOme of the members of the human rights committe are MORE PRO-WOMEN and wanted to defend them , and that is precisely one reason that Bin Bez 's Fatwah implied for the `` Illegality `` of this committee and for his claim that it represents `` Outside interests '' There is a human rights issue in Saudi ARabia , and YOU and NY times chose to ignore the main issue and select some of the members of that committee and actually defend the actions done against them ( including banning them from their Jobs . What a hypocricy . I am not surprised really , THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME . The official Ulema are the most extremist anti-women meat-heads in Saudi Arabia , the west continues on its campaign to discredit itself in the Muslim community , by supporting them .

Furthermore , he also informed me that back a few years ago in the Cup finals between Roch and Spring , that the Amerks charged favoritism by the office and that : '' ... there were little questionable things liket he AHL president and staff attending all games with the Springfield brass , including sitting in their box for the game in Springfield and , according to the Rochester media , openly cheering for Springfield .

As to why these early practices `` only parallel '' and do not exactly duplicate the modern LDS ceremony , there are a couple of reasons : 1 . Quite likely we do not have the exact original from ancient times . This stuff was not commonly known but bits and pieces undoubtedly spread . ( Much as bits and pieces of the modern ceremony get known . ) What we have in the 40 day literature , the Egyptian ceremonies , and certain Native American ceremonies is almost certainly not exactly what Jesus taught . 2 . Certain aspects of the ceremony are normally modified to fit the situation , much as the modern ceremony has been modified to fit the audio-visual tools now available .

Luckily the guy stops a foot behind my rear wheel . > I understand why you theoretically stop so far behind a car but can you > really in actuality avoid such an incident ? Suggestions ? The experience you describe is why I do n't like to sit with my bike in gear - I figure there 's a chance that I 'll be startled in some way and stall my bike . And I figure this is more likely than the chance that I 'll be unable to escape some situation because of the extra time needed to put the bike in gear . So I concentrate on avoiding situations rather than making split-second evasive manuvers . I split lanes so I 'm not at the end of the line . ( Unfortunately this is not legal in most of the country ) If I can't split ( perhaps there is n't room ) then I will stop near one side of the lane so I have an easy escape , and leave my bike in gear until the next car has stopped . I watch in my mirrors in the mean time to make sure it will ! Whether I really would have time to move should a car fail to stop , I have n't had to find out yet . Some cars have an annoying habbit of racing up behind you before braking heavilly , so it can be hard to tell if they are planning to brake or not ! So in summary , position yourself for an easy exit , and then watch your mirrors until it 's all clear . -- Paul Thompson Apple Computer

They are actually Seagate 's ST412 , MFM , full height , has the IBM logo and black face plate . Each disk is checked and formatted with DOS 6.0 . It can be doubled to 20Mb or so with dblspace or stacker if you so desire . Have the original IBM foam fitted boxies and anti-static bags . I am not sure if they were ever used , but each drive that is sent out will be quarenteed in good working order . $ 30 each plus shipping cost , ( about $ 5 ) , If you have one of those old IBM XT or PCs , this is for you !

Yes . Here 's what you should do . Keep the vertices in an array , and have the polygons ( triangles are okay , but n-sided polygons are slightly more efficient ) store the indices into the array of the vertices that comprise them . You set a flag for each vertex when you transform it , so you do n't have to transform any vertex more than once ; you also do backface elimination before processing the polygon , so that vertices that belong only to bacfacing polys do n't have to be transformed at all . Whenever you transform a vertex , check if it 's on the far side of the hither plane ; if it is , you can project it right away and store the result . Then do your Z clip ; any vertices that get produced will have to have their projection done at that stage . -- Bernie Roehl University of Waterloo Dept of Electrical and Computer Engineering Mail : broehl @ sunee.UWaterloo.ca Voice : ( 519 ) 885-1211 x 2607 [ work ]

Roger , Your responses might just exclude you from sharing your opinions , then . You see , the same rights Ali has to mail her letter to the NHL are the same ones that let you post replies that mow her down like wheat at harvest-time . She never said she represented the entire internet or the entire group rec.sport.hockey . She has every right to state her opinion along with those of the fifty or sixty or hundred-odd folk who 've agreed to allow her to list their names on the bottom of it . You may not agree with it . Fine . I really do n't care enough about the name change to care . Your name is n't attached to it , so why moan and complain ? If you felt her words were leading , well , you 're free to feel that way and take exception , but manners never hurt . I personally disagree and feel her generalizations were fine ( I have the right to think and say that , too ) . Ali 's under no compunction to change a single word . Now , while you 're free to disagree with every word she wrote , to tear apart her character is uncalled for . I 'm posting this as a form of public reprimand . If you tear down Ali 's integrity and character publicly , you 'll get chastised publicly in return . Would it have been so hard to say , `` Ali , please be a bit more specific in your description , the way I 've read it indicates you 're stating my view also , and that 's simply not true . I 'd really like to see a disclaimer noting that you do n't mean the entire internet or the entire r.s.h . group attached to it , despite your intent to list names at the bottom . Thanks . Cordially as always , '' & c. Calling her a moron and an asshole just reduces the weight of your words and the opinions of their author in the eyes of myself , and possibly others .

As David Veal points out , this sort of `` promotion '' would be used against gun owners by the mass media . However , here is my proposal : offer gun safety classes in your area , free , as a community service . Such a class would normally cost $ 40 or $ 50 , so offering it free is a good promotion . Our Gun Club has organized several of these ( we just finished teaching another one last night , in fact ) and they have been very well received . We get a lot of people who are novices interested in guns . We even get a few who are anti-gun , but feel they should know something about `` gun safety '' since members of their family keep guns at home . Teaching such a course gives us many desirable benefits : ( 1 ) We have the chance to teach gun safety rules ; this increases firearm awareness and may help to reduce gun accident stats . ( 2 ) A `` gun safety '' class is Politically Correct , and likely to be viewed positively by the public and the media . ( 3 ) Most of the students are 'normal people ' ( not gun enthusiasts ) and this kind of class gives us the chance to give them a gentle introduction to firearms . ( 4 ) Some of the students are enthusiastic , and will purchase a gun and become more involved in shooting or personal defense . ( 5 ) It improves the public perception of our club and gun owners in general . Our students see that we are all reasonable , non-aggressive , soft-spoken people , which helps to mitigate the standard image of a hardcore gun owner . Even anti-gun students sometimes tell us they have `` something new to think about '' with regards to personal gun ownership . ( 6 ) Sharing our experience with others is a lot of fun . Our course is the standard NRA-certified `` Home Firearm Safety '' class , and our students pay only $ 5 for materials . We also teach the NRA 's `` Personal Protection '' class , although the cost is higher for that one since we have to purchase range time . I think firearms safety classes are an excellent response to gun buy-backs . -- Alane -- / -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -\ / NOBODY shares my opinions , | `` I am a jelly doughnut '' \ / especially not my employer | -- President John F Kennedy \ / -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -\

From : albert @ tornado.seas.ucla.edu ( Albert E. Chou ) Subject : Re : Good APS experience Organization : School of Engineering and Applied Sciences , UCLA Lines : 31 I thought I 'd share a good experience , too . I bought the APS Quantum 240 zero footprint drive in May '92 ( back when they still used two separate LEDs on the front panel and the case was metal ) . While traveling with it ( it was in my SE/30 Mac bag , on top of the Mac ) this past winter , one of the plastic tabs holding the front panel on broke , so that the right side of the front panel was coming forward away from the rest of the drive . I lived with this situation until it became completely intolerable ( which more or less coincided with a network shutdown at school and a trip out of town I had to take , which gave me some dead time during which to have the drive sent out ) . I called APS for an RMA # and got one , with no questions asked about how the tab got broken ( it was handled a little roughly by airline baggage handlers -- though nothing else was damaged [ well , except for the internal speaker in my modem , which was n't that well glued down to begin with ] -- yeah , yeah , I'm never flying with my SE/30 again ) . And when I called back to ask whether I could send it in a little later rather than right away , they had no problem with that -- even when I exceeded the normal valid period for an RMA # by a day ( they 're usually good for 10 days ) . The front panel was replaced under warranty , and the drive was shipped back quickly ( I mailed it first class insured on a Saturday by noon from L.A. to Missouri , and it came back by Fed Ex by Friday [ I do n't know exactly what day it came back because I was traveling that week from Wednesday afternoon to Sunday afternoon ] ) . The only thing that could 've been bad was that the first service rep I talked to , in an attempt to prevent jeopardizing my data , suggested that I take the drive mechanism out and send just the case . Unfortunately , I discovered the day I was mailing the thing , that would necessitate breaking the little seal and thus voiding the warranty ! Oh , well . Al albert @ seas.ucla.edu

They wanted to put strong crypto into them since they had the capacity . The government decided to `` discourage '' them . Really , none of this stuff is especially hard . All you need for a true private phone is an ISDN codec , a vocoder ( either a chip or software ) , an encryptor ( a chip is fine , but software is more than fast enough ) , a V.32 or V.32bis modem module , and maybe a microcontroller to run the whole thing . Its easy to do , its cheap . And any `` normal '' company trying to put one out will likely get a visit from the boys in the dark suits from Washington , just like Qualcomm did . I suspect that companies like Cylink are tolerated because their products are too expensive . However , no law yet stops one from building really private phones , in spite of the hints the administration has made when discussing the new '' crime bill '' and in connection with the Clipper/Skipjack Big Brother chip . Someone out there WILL build a unit to do all this . Better yet , prehaps someone will produce a package that turns any 486 box with a sound card into a secure phone . -- Perry Metzger pmetzger @ shearson.com -- Laissez faire , laissez passer .

III . ***** NEWS FROM THE WIRES ****** Sender : Jonathan Lord < jml4s @ uva.pcmail.virginia.edu > Subject : RESURGENCE OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE CONCERNS CDC Date : Thursday April 15 , 1993 ATLANTA ( UPI ) -- A resurgence of infectious diseases blamed on newly emerging viruses and bacteria pose a major challenge for the nation's health care system , federal health officials said Thursday . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , reporting its latest findings in an investigation of contaminated hamburger meat that sickened hundreds in 4 states and killed at least four , said it will put renewed emphasis on battling infectious diseases . Part of that emphasis includes a new series titled `` Emerging Infectious Diseases '' to be featured in the CDC 's Morbidity & Mortality Weekly Report , which has a wide circulation in the health community . The issue also will top the agenda of a two-day meeting of scientific counselors to update the CDC 's draft plan for dealing with the growing threat of infectious ailments . `` This is an issue that has been coming and we do have a responsibility to deal with it , '' said Dr. Ruth Berkelman , deputy director of the CDC's National Center for Infectious Diseases . There were more cases of malaria in the U.S. in 1992 than in any year since the 1960s , and Latin America is experiencing a cholera epidemic , the first in this century , she said . Resistance of disease-causing agents to antibiotics is also a problem . `` We are seeing much more antibiotic resistance than we have in the past '' Berkleman said . She said even common ear infections frequently seen in children are becoming resistant to antibiotic treatment . `` Despite predictions earlier this century that infectious diseases would soon be eliminated as a public health problem , infectious diseases remain the major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illness and death in the United States , '' the CDC said . It cited the emergence since the 1970s of a `` myriad '' of newly identified pathogens and syndromes , such as Escherichia coli O157 : H7 , a deadly bacterial infection ; the hepatitis C virus ; HIV , the virus that causes AIDS ; Legionnaires disease ; Lyme disease ; and toxic shock syndrome . `` The incidences of many diseases widely presumed to be under control , such as cholera , malaria and tuberculosis , have increased in many areas , '' the CDC said . It said efforts at control and prevention have been undermined by drug resistance . =====*===== SOURCE : WALL STREET JOURNAL REFERENCE : 04/15/93 , pB1 HEADLINE : Lyme-Disease Ruling Raises Liability Issues The tick that causes Lyme disease may have found a new way to cause damage : legal liability . A federal judge 's decision holding a property owner liable for not doing enough to protect workers from Lyme disease is getting as much attention as the latest medical study on the disease , a flu-like illness that can cause severe physical and mental disabilities and in rare instances death . The decision last week has put property owners on notice that they may have to do more than protect themselves from the ticks-they also may have to protect themselves from litigation if someone becomes infected while on the property . The decision by U.S. District Judge Robert J . Ward in New York came after a week-long trial in a case involving four track workers for the Long Island Railroad . Judge Ward found that the workers contracted the disease after they were bitten by ticks while on the job . He ordered the New York state-owned commuter line to pay the workers more than $ 560,000 to compensate for pain and suffering , in addition to medical expenses and lost wages . Summer camps , schools , companies with facilities in rural or semirural areas , and homeowners who rent to vacationers are among the groups that need to be worried about this ruling , says Stephen L. Kass , an attorney at New York law firm Berle , Kass & Case , who wrote a legal article three years ago warning property owners of the potential liability . Even a family that invites friends over for a backyard barbecue might be potentially liable . Lawsuits for insect bites , while rare , are n't unheard-of . A summer vacationer in Southampton , N.Y. , last year sued the owner of the home she rented , claiming that a tick on the property gave her Rocky Mountain spotted fever . In 1988 , also on Long Island , a jury ordered an outdoor restaurant to pay more than $ 3 million to a patron who was stung by a bee , causing an allergic reaction and permanent quadriplegia . The judge later threw out the award , citing no evidence that a beehive was near the restaurant . But lawyers say that the attention to Lyme disease throughout the country -- it 's most prevalent in New England , the Middle Atlantic states , Wisconsin , Minnesota and the Northwest -- may make this particular insect bite a particularly litigious one . The illness already has proved to be a source of controversy in the courtroom over such issues as the type of medical care insurers will cover and medical malpractice claims against doctors for not diagnosing the disease . Lawyers say worker's-compensation claims related to Lyme disease have become common in some states in recent years . Payments in worker's-compensation cases , however , are limited to medical costs and lost earnings . The case before Judge Ward dealt with a potentially much more lucrative avenue for damages , because it involved the question of negligence . Unlike the worker 's compensation process , the law governing injuries to rail workers allows for a finding of negligence and , as a result , for additional payments for pain and suffering . Property owners and lawyers say that negligence claims can be made in many other situations where people are exposed to the ticks that carry the disease . Ira M. Maurer , a partner at New York law firm Elkind , Flynn & Maurer , who represented the rail workers , says the decision will help to establish `` the duty of all sorts of property owners to protect against Lyme disease . '' Lawyers caution that despite Judge Ward 's decision , winning a lawsuit for damages caused by Lyme disease may prove difficult . For one thing , victims have to demonstrate that they have pinned down when and where they got the tick bite . Judge Ward found that the plaintiffs in the railroad case got Lyme disease while working on property owned by the railroad , even though none of the men remembered being bitten . The workers , who were n't outdoorsmen likely to be exposed elsewhere to the insects , said they saw ticks in the high grass that surrounded some work sites . A spokeswoman for the railroad says that there was no proof that the four men were bitten while on the job and that the railroad is considering an appeal . The railroad also disputes Judge Ward 's finding that it did n't do enough to protect employees . The spokeswoman says the railroad provides track workers with insect repellent and special pants to protect against bug bites . Debate in the scientific community over Lyme disease could open up some legal defenses for property owners , such as questioning whether a victim actually has the disease rather than some other illness . Earlier this week , the Journal of the American Medical Association reported that doctors overly diagnose patients as having Lyme disease . And damages awarded to a victim also might be influenced by medical disputes over the degree of harm that Lyme disease causes . Because of health and safety concerns , some groups and companies already take special measures to protect against Lyme disease . Last year , at its headquarters in Franklin Lakes , N.J. , Becton , Dickinson & Co. began using Damminix , a pesticide made by EcoHealth Inc. of Boston that is designed to kill ticks carrying the disease . The medical- supply company 's headquarters include a 120-acre park , and the company was worried that employees who walk on its trails for recreation might get infected . Ruth Lister , a spokeswoman for the American Camping Association in Indianapolis , says that many youth camps accredited by her organization also have begun to check children for ticks . And Carole Katz , a member of the board of the Fire Island Pines Property Owners Association , says her group spends $ 30,000 each year to treat their 100-acre site off the coast of New York with the tick-killing pesticide . =====*===== TITLE : Urinary dysfunction in Lyme disease . AUTHORS : Chancellor MB ; McGinnis DE ; Shenot PJ ; Kiilholma P ; Hirsch IH , Department of Urology , Jefferson Medical College , Thomas Jefferson University , Philadelphia , Pennsylvania . REFERENCE : J Urol 1993 Jan ; 149 ( 1 ) : 26-30 Lyme disease , which is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi , is associated with a variety of neurological sequelae . We describe 7 patients with neuro-borreliosis who also had lower urinary tract dysfunction . Urodynamic evaluation revealed detrusor hyperreflexia in 5 patients and detrusor areflexia in 2 . Detrusor external sphincter dyssynergia was not noted on electromyography in any patient . We observed that the urinary tract may be involved in 2 respects in the course of Lyme disease : 1 ) voiding dysfunction may be part of neuro-borreliosis and 2 ) the spirochete may directly invade the urinary tract . In 1 patient bladder infection by the Lyme spirochete was documented on biopsy . Neurological and urological symptoms in all patients were slow to resolve and convalescence was protracted . Relapses of active Lyme disease and residual neurological deficits were common . Urologists practicing in areas endemic for Lyme disease need to be aware of B. burgdorferi infection in the differential diagnosis of neurogenic bladder dysfunction . Conservative bladder management including clean intermittent catheterization guided by urodynamic evaluation is recommended .

Lines : 38 NNTP-Posting-Host : blade.stack.urc.tue.nl X-Newsreader : TIN [ version 1.1 PL6 ] I am looking for a program to draw various kinds of diagrams on my Linux system . - It must be free . - It must run on standard ( monochrome ) X with a small screen size ( 800x600 ) No motif/openlook etc . - It must compile under Linux with gcc/g++ . Most generic unix software works ok. - It must produce postscript files that I can include into LaTeX documents with dvips . Or just tell me another free program that converts one of the supported formats to ps . - It must produce drawings that are larger than the window size ( scrollable ) . I know of several such programs , idraw , xfig . tgif . I have no experience with any of them . Features I would like in the programs are . - ability to draw circles , arcs , straight lines , boxes and arrows . - support for both dashed and solid line styles for all of these objects . - support for texts in any size . - ability to move/copy/resize/rotate any part of the drawing . - ability to turn any part of the drawing into a library component ( e.g . a transistor symbol composed of three lines , an arrow and a circle ) - any aid ( numeric coordinates , screen grid ) to align parts of the drawing . - less essential , but in fact very handy : preservation of connection . If I move one part of the drawing , the lines that connect that part to the rest of the drawing , stay connected . Ideally I want the tool so general and flexible that it is comfortable to draw electronic schematics , flow charts , logic diagrams , data flow diagrams and block diagrams with it . I just want to know which of the programs offer which of the features on my whishlist and are there any other programs ? How demanding are the programs with respect to disk space , memory and CPU usage ? Are any of the programs known to work on Linux with monochrome X ? Lennart .

SYNERGY : Revolt ... the first in a continuing series of collaborative art initiatives designed to exploit the binarity of the infosphere . This series of diversely structured art-manipulation projects will attempt to stretch across network boundries encouraging use of electronic mail , fax , video , photography , scanned `` conventional '' art and even sound to create multi-artist `` still '' visuals in GIF and JPG formats . Visualists from all technical levels are welcome . REVOLT will be structured simply . There will be three stages of production . The first stage will consist of all participants creating one still work as a `` starter '' piece that two other partici- pants will , in turn , manipulate . All first stage '' base '' images are due by Sunday , May 23rd , 1993 , midnight Central Daylight Time . Stage two will begin on May 24th . All images will be sent to another ( arbitrarily chosen ) participant for them to do manipulations on in anyway they see fit . For purely digital artists , this may consist of filtering the image through their favorite paint program . For `` analog '' artists , this may well be printing a hardcopy of the image and adding their own part with pen , pencil or white-out then scan- ning in the image again to be transferred on to the third-stage artist . All second-stage works are due by midnight on Sunday , May 30th . Stage three is the finishing stage and will begin on May 31st . All artists will do what they think it takes to finish up the image they 've been given using whatever technique they see as worthy . These images will be due on June 6th , midnight .

According to the CBO the United States has a force of about 88,000 US Army personel in Europe , I do not know if this includes a USMC division in Norway . They have available a little more than 500 USAF attack aircraft , including various models of the F-111 , A-10 , F-19A/B , and a few F-4s . { there are about 1,000 more of these available , SAFELY TUCKED AWAY AT HOME . At one time , the US maintained 1500 MBTs { about half were M1A1 } but some of these were relocated to the Persian Gulf . I know the US has at LEAST one aircraft carrier battle group nearby and probably a marine assault brigade . Does anyone know if there are any B-52/B-1Bs in England ? The point is , although there are no US ground troops in Bosnia , it is not true that that all the american forces are safely camped outside of St. Louis . I also understand that the administration is planning to position troops in Macedonia . Any reaction out there to this ? Question : day before yesterday I heard that Serbia & Montenegro had imposed additional trade sanctions against the Bosnian Serb Rebels . This morning a NPR reported at a bridge on the Drina ( sp ? ) verified that only a bread truck was allowed to pass through to Bosnia . A Serbian { who happened to be muslim } , stated that just a few months ago no vehicle even slowed for the boarder station . Now everyone is stopped and searched , many are turned back . Of course all I heard was a translators version , I do not speak Serbo-Croatian . If this is a effort on the part of Serbia & Montenegro { for whatever reason } to push the Boserbs into accepting the V-O , is this not a good thing ? Peace , Jay Morris

Refs calls ( especially last night ) tended to favour Leafs . A couple of comments : 1 . On Gilmour : Just because the guy is n't one of the three stars does n't mean he was not leading the team . Someone posted the playoff point total and he 's in something like fifth or sixth place ... .plus , he walked away with the Molson cup ( given for accumulating points from the three star selection ) during the regular season . 2 .

Let me improve this one for you , then . For nearly one thousand years , the Turkish and Kurdish people lived on their homeland - the last one hundred under the oppressive Soviet and Armenian occupation . The persecutions culminated in 1914 : The Armenian Government planned and carried out a Genocide against its Muslim subjects . 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were murdered and the remainder driven out of their homeland . After one thousand years , Turkish and Kurdish lands were empty of Turks and Kurds . The survivors found a safe heaven in Turkiye . Today , x-Soviet Armenian government rejects the right of Turks and Kurds to return to their Muslim lands occupied by x-Soviet Armenia . Today , x-Soviet Armenia covers up the genocide perpetrated by its predecessors and is therefore an accessory to this crime against humanity . x-Soviet Armenia must pay for its crime of genocide against the Muslims by admitting to the crime and making reparations to the Turks and Kurds . Turks and Kurds demand the right to return to their lands , to determine their own future as a nation in their own homeland . ... On this occasion , we once again reiterate the unquestioned justice of the restitution of Turkish and Kurdish rights and ... - We demand that the x-Soviet Armenian Government admit its responsibility for the Turkish and Kurdish Genocide , render reparations to the Muslim people , and return the land to its rightful owners . The recognition of the Genocide has become an issue which can not be delayed further , and it is imperative that artificial obstacles created for political manipulations be removed . - We believe the time has come to demand from the the United States that it formally recognizes the Turkish and Kurdish Genocide , adopts the principles of our demands and refuses to accede to Armenian pressures to the contrary . - As taxpayers of the United States , we express our vehement protest to the present U.S. Government policy of continued coddling , protection and unqualified assistance towards x-Soviet Armenia . - Our territorial demands are strictly aimed at x-Soviet Armenia 's .

What are your thoughts on it ? I read it when it first came out , and the controversy broke . Put my name on the waiting list at the library ( that way if the book was really offensive , none of my money would find its way to the author or publisher ) , and read it , `` cover to cover '' ( to use a phrase that seems popular here right now ) . And I *liked* it . The writing style was a little hard to get used to , but it was well worth the effort . Coming from a similar background ( Rushdie grew up in Bombay in a muslim family , and moved to England ; I grew up in New Delhi ) , it made a strong impression on me . ( And he used many of the strange constructions of Indian English : the `` yaar '' at the end of a sentence , `` Butbutbut , '' the occasional hindi phrase , etc . ) At the time I still `` sorta-kinda '' thought of myself as a muslim , and I could n't see what the flap was all about . It seemed clear to me that this was allegory . It was clear that he described some local prostitutes who took on the names and personae of Muhammed 's wives , and had not ( as my grandfather thundered ) implied that Muhammed 's wives were prostitutes ; in short , every angry muslim that had read even part of the book seemed to have missed the point completely . ( And I wo n't mention the fact that the most militant of them had never even seen the book . Oops , I just did ! ) Perhaps in a deep sense , the book is insulting to Islam , because it exposes the silliness of revealed religion - why does an omnipotent deity need an agent ? She can come directly to me , ca n't she ? How do we know that Muhammed did n't just go out into the desert and smoke something ? And how do we know that the scribes he dictated the Quran to did n't screw up , or put in their own little verses ? And why can Muhammed marry more than four women , when no other muslim is allowed to ? ( Although I think the biggest insult to Islam is that the majority of its followers would want to suppress a book , sight unseen , on the say-so of some `` holy '' guy . Not to mention murder the author . ) > Over the years , when I have made this point , various primarily muslim > posters have responded , saying that yes indeed they have read the book > and had called it such things as `` filth and lies '' , `` I would rank > Rushdie 's book with Hitler 's Mein Kempf or worse '' , and so on . I had much the same response when I tried to talk about the book . A really silly argument - after all , how many of these same people have read `` Mein Kampf ? '' It just made me wonder - what are they afraid of ? Why do n't they just read the book and decide for themselves ? Maybe the reaction of the muslim community to the book , and the absence of protest from the `` liberal '' muslims to Khomeini 's fatwa outrage , was the final push I needed into atheism ! -s -- Shamim Mohamed / { uunet , noao , cmcl2.. } ! arizona ! shamim / shamim @ cs.arizona.edu `` Take this cross and garlic ; here 's a Mezuzah if he 's Jewish ; a page of the Koran if he 's a Muslim ; and if he 's a Zen Buddhist , you 're on your own .

From : mcelwre @ cnsvax.uwec.edu Subject : FREE-ENERGY TECHNOLOGY Organization : University of Wisconsin Eau Claire Lines : 248 IMPORTANT-INFO : It is HUMBLY suggested by Robert 's FANS that you REDIRECT all FOLLOWUPS into alt.fan.robert.mcelwaine , or at least CONSIDER doing so . FREE-ENERGY TECHNOLOGY by Robert E. McElwaine , Physicist Ninety to a hundred years ago , everybody `` knew '' that a heavier-than-air machine could not possibly fly . It would violate the `` laws '' of physics . All of the `` experts '' and `` authorities '' said so . For example , Simon Newcomb declared in 1901 : `` The demonstration that no possible combination of known substances , known forms of machinery and known forms of force , can be united in a practical machine by which man shall fly long distances through the air , seems to the writer as complete as it is possible for the demonstration of any physical fact to be . '' Fortunately , a few SMART people such as the Wright Brothers did NOT accept such pronouncements as the final word . Now we take airplanes for granted , ( except when they crash ) . Today , orthodox physicists and other `` scientists '' are saying similar things against several kinds of 'Free Energy ' Technologies , using negative terms such as `` pseudo-science '' and `` perpetual motion '' , and citing so-called `` laws '' which assert that `` energy can not be created or destroyed '' ( `` 1st law of thermodynamics '' ) and `` there is always a decrease in useful energy '' ( `` 2nd law of thermodynamics '' ) . The physicists do not know how to do certain things , so they ARROGANTLY declare that those things can not be done . Such PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE are COMMON in orthodox modern `` science '' and help to cover up INCONSISTENCIES and CONTRADICTIONS in orthodox modern theories . Free Energy Inventions are devices which can tap a seemingly UNLIMITED supply of energy from the universe , with- OUT burning any kind of fuel , making them the PERFECT SOLUTION to the world-wide energy crisis and its associated pollution , degradation , and depletion of the environment . Most Free Energy Devices probably do not create energy , but rather tap into EXISTING natural energy sources by various forms of induction . UNLIKE solar or wind devices , they need little or no energy storage capacity , because they can tap as much energy as needed WHEN needed . Solar energy has the DIS-advantage that the sun is often blocked by clouds , trees , buildings , or the earth itself , or is reduced by haze or smog or by thick atmosphere at low altitudes and high latitudes . Likewise , wind speed is WIDELY VARIABLE and often non-existent . Neither solar nor wind power are suitable to directly power cars and airplanes . Properly designed Free Energy Devices do NOT have such limitations . For example , at least three U.S. patents ( # 3,811,058 , # 3,879,622 , and # 4,151,431 ) have so far been awarded for motors that run EXCLUSIVELY on permanent MAGNETS , seemingly tapping into energy circulating through the earth 's magnetic field . The first two require a feedback network in order to be self-running . The third one , as described in detail in `` Science & Mechanics '' magazine , Spring 1980 , ( `` Amazing Magnet-Powered Motor '' , by Jorma Hyypia , pages 45-48 , 114-117 , and front cover ) , requires critical sizes , shapes , orientations , and spacings of magnets , but NO feedback . Such a motor could drive an electric generator or reversible heatpump in one 's home , YEAR ROUND , FOR FREE . [ Complete descriptive copies of U.S. patents are $ 3.00 each from the U.S. Patent Office , 2021 Jefferson Davis Hwy. , Arlington , VA 22202 ; correct 7-digit patent number required . Or try getting copies of BOTH the article AND the Patents via your local public or university library 's inter-library loan dept.. ] A second type of free-energy device , such as the 'Gray Motor ' ( U.S. Patent # 3,890,548 ) , the 'Tesla Coil ' , and the motor of inventor Joseph Newman [ see SCIENCE , 2-10-84 , pages 571-2 . ] , taps ELECTRO-MAGNETIC energy by INDUCTION from 'EARTH RESONANCE ' ( about 12 cycles per second plus harmonics ) . They typically have a 'SPARK GAP ' in the circuit which serves to SYNCHRONIZE the energy in the coils with the energy being tapped . It is important that the total 'inductance ' and 'capacitance ' of the Device combine to 'RESONATE ' at the same frequency as 'EARTH RESONANCE ' in order to maximize the power output . This output can also be increased by centering the SPARK GAP at the 'NEUTRAL CENTER ' of a strong U-shaped permanent magnet . In the case of a Tesla Coil , slipping a 'TOROID CHOKE COIL ' around the secondary coil will enhance output power . [ `` Earth Energy : Fuelless Propulsion & Power Systems '' , by John Bigelow , 1976 , Health Research , P.O . Box 70 , Mokelumne Hill , CA 95245 . ] During the 1930 's , an Austrian civil engineer named Viktor Schauberger invented and partially developed an 'IMPLOSION TURBINE ' ( German name , 'ZOKWENDLE ' ) , after analyzing erosion , and lack of erosion , in differently shaped waterways , and developing sophisticated mathematical equations to explain it . As described in the book `` A Breakthrough to New Free-Energy Sources '' , by Dan A. Davidson , 1977 , water is pumped by an IMPELLER pump through a LOGARITHMIC-SPIRAL-shaped coil of tubing until it reaches a CRITICAL VELOCITY . The water then IMPLODES , no longer touching the inside walls of the tubing , and drives the pump , which then converts the pump 's motor into an ELECTRIC GENERATOR . The device seems to be tapping energy from that of the earth 's rotation , via the 'Coriolis effect ' , LIKE A TORNADO . [ It can also NEUTRALIZE GRAVITY ! ] A fourth type of Free Energy Device is the 'McClintock Air Motor ' ( U.S. Patent # 2,982,261 ) , which is a cross between a diesel engine ( it has three cylinders with a compression ratio of 27 to 1 ) and a rotary engine ( with solar and planetary gears ) . It burns NO FUEL , but becomes self-running by driving its own air compressor . This engine also generates a lot of heat , which could be used to heat buildings ; and its very HIGH TORQUE makes it ideal for large trucks , preventing their slowing down when climbing hills . [ David McClintock is also the REAL original Inventor of the automatic transmission , differential , and 4-wheel drive . ] Crystals may someday be used to supply energy , as shown in the Star Trek shows , perhaps by inserting each one between metal capacitor plates and bombarding it with a beam of particles from a small radioactive source like that used in a common household smoke detector . One other energy source should be mentioned here , despite the fact that it does not fit the definition of Free Energy . A Bulgarian-born American Physicist named Joseph Maglich has invented and partially developed an atomic FUSION reactor which he calls 'Migma ' , which uses NON-radioactive deuterium as a fuel [ available in nearly UNLIMITED quantities from sea water ] , does NOT produce radioactive waste , can be converted DIRECTLY into electricity ( with-OUT energy-wasting steam turbines ) , and can be constructed small enough to power a house or large enough to power a city . And UNLIKE the `` Tokamaks '' and laser fusion MONSTROSITIES that we read about , Migma WORKS , already producing at least three watts of power for every watt put in . [ `` New Times '' ( U.S. version ) , 6-26-78 , pages 32-40 . ] And then there are the 'cold fusion ' experiments that have been in the news lately , originally conducted by University of Utah researchers B. Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann . Some U.S. Navy researchers at the China Lake Naval Weapons Center in California , under the direction of chemist Melvin Miles , finally took the trouble to collect the bubbles coming from such an apparatus , had them analyzed with mass-spectrometry techniques , and found HELIUM 4 , which PROVES that atomic FUSION did indeed take place , and enough of it to explain the excess heat generated . There are GOOD INDICATIONS that the two so-called `` laws '' of thermodynamics are NOT so `` absolute '' . For example , the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson developed a comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe , which he calls the 'Reciprocal System ' , ( which he describes in detail in several books such as `` Nothing But Motion '' ( 1979 ) and `` The Universe of Motion '' ( 1984 ) ) , in which the physical universe has TWO DISTINCT HALVES , the material half and an anti-matter half , with a CONTINUOUS CYCLE of matter and energy passing between them , with-OUT the `` heat death '' predicted by thermodynamic `` laws '' . His Theory explains the universe MUCH BETTER than modern orthodox theories , including phenomena that orthodox physicists and astronomers are still scratching their heads about , and is SELF-CONSISTENT in every way . Some Free Energy Devices might be tapping into that energy flow , seemingly converting `` low-quality energy '' into `` high-quality energy '' . Also , certain religious organizations such as 'Sant Mat ' and 'Eckankar ' teach their Members that the physical universe is only the LOWEST of at least a DOZEN major levels of existence , like parallel universes , or analogous to TV channels , as described in books like `` The Path of the Masters '' , by Dr. Julian Johnson , 1939 , and `` Eckankar : The Key to Secret Worlds '' , by Sri Paul Twitchell , 1969 . For example , the next level up from the physical universe is commonly called the 'Astral Plane ' . Long-time Members of these groups have learned to 'Soul Travel ' into these higher worlds and report on conditions there . It seems plausible that energy could flow down from these higher levels into the physical universe , or be created at the boundary between them , given the right configuration of matter to channel it . This is supported by many successful laboratory-controlled experiments in PSYCHO-KINESIS throughout the world , such as those described in the book `` Psychic Discoveries Behind the Iron Curtain '' . In terms of economics , the market has FAILED . Inventors do not have enough money and other resources to fully develop and mass-produce Free Energy Equipment , and the conventional energy producer $ have no desire to do so because of their VE $ TED INTERE $ T $ . The government is needed to intervene . If the government does not intervene , then the total supply of energy resources from the earth will continue to decline and will soon run out , prices for energy will increase , and pollution and its harmful effects ( including the 'GREENHOUSE EFFECT ' , acid rain , smog , radioactive contamination , oil spills , rape of the land by strip mining , etc . ) will continue to increase . The government should SUBSIDIZE research and development of Free Energy by Inventors and universities , subsidize private production ( until the producers can make it on their own ) , and subsidize consumption by low-income consumers of Free Energy Hardware . The long-range effects of such government intervention would be wide-spread and profound . The quantity of energy demanded from conventional energy producer $ ( coal mining companie $ , oil companie $ and countries , electric utilitie $ , etc . ) would drop to near zero , forcing their employees to seek work elsewhere . Energy resources ( coal , uranium , oil , and gas ) would be left in the ground . Prices for conventional energy supplies would also drop to near zero , while the price of Free Energy Equipment would start out high but drop as supply increases ( as happened with VCR 's , personal computers , etc. ) . Costs of producing products that require large quantities of energy to produce would decrease , along with their prices to consumers . Consumers would be able to realize the `` opportunity costs '' of paying electric utility bills or buying home heating fuel . Tourism would benefit and increase because travelers would not have to spend their money for gasoline for their cars . Government tax revenue from gasoline and other fuels would have to be obtained in some other way . AND ENERGY COULD NO LONGER BE USED AS A MOTIVE OR EXCUSE FOR MAKING WAR . Many conventional energy producer $ would go out of business , but society as a whole , and the earth 's environment and ecosystems , would benefit greatly . It is the People , that government should serve , rather than the big corporation $ and bank $ .

I 'd be willing to bet that _every_ manufacturer used those little self-contained modules . I think Sharp made them .

I 'm not the type to sue anyone at a drop of the hat nor am I the type to report every little ding to the insurance company as a vandalism claim . Please help . Thanks in advance . George

It depends on how he defines God . The way I understand the meaning of that term preclues it being used in a useful way in science . Ideas drawn from an understanding that God is supernatural precludes us from forming scientific assertions that can be falsified , that is , where we can decide that they are true or false within the terms of we use and useful observations drawn from them . Some religionists have an interest in bluring the definitions within science to make them more reconcilable , and especially subserviant in a basic way , to religious dogma . This pursuit always fails . > I think I got his point -- I can quote the section if I 'm being vague . > The examples he gave were quarks and continental plates . Are there > explanations of science or parts of theories that are not measurable in and of > themselves , or can everything be quantified , measured , tested , etc. ? Reconciliation of science with religion involves circumventing the tendancy to claim that either pursuit can gain absolute or certian knowledge , or that the domain of truth in each is fundementally limited in some way . It gererally confurs the element of uncertainty and limitations to human knowledge while allowing for the different concerns of these separate pursuits . Science and religion ask different questions which have imperfect and provisional answers , at best . Science is distinctly limited in where it can ask meaningful questions . More questions can be posed than it can answer . At the basis of sacred language is the place where words fail us and mere assertions disolve in contradiction . Bruce Salem
From : loh @ fraser.sfu.ca ( Keith Meng-Wei Loh ) Subject : Canucks 3-2 over Winnipeg Organization : Simon Fraser University , Burnaby , B.C. , Canada Lines : 51 The Jets gave the Canucks another run for their money in an almost identical game to the first of the series but once again came up short as Vancouver outscored Winnipeg 3-2 . The pattern of the first game was repeated tonight , with the Canucks scoring quickly and then going to sleep in the second period , only to stave off a Jet comeback with opportune goals from their greater talent . The Jets looked more dangerous in this one but it did n't make a difference in the numbers that counted : goals . Vancouver 's big line produced again , with centre Cliff Ronning and left winger Geoff Courtnall scoring in the first and in the second to boost the Canucks to a 2-0 lead on giveaways by the suspect Jet defence of Bautin and Ulanov . Mental lapses by the defence and goal-scoring talent in opportune areas made the difference in all three Canuck goals . However , as in the first game , the Jets worked hard to take the game to the Canucks in the second period . The Jets dominated the second , checking hard and penetrating the Vancouver zone without being challenged by a Canuck team that wanted to pack it in early . The hard work paid off late in the second , when Tie Domi caught Vancouver goalie Kirk McLean by surprise with a sharp angle shot to make the score 2-1 . Domi 's goal gave the Jets new life as they began to take the rush to the Canuck 's collapsing defence . The Canucks were unwilling to do anything but let McLean take shots and clear the rebounds . The Jets were allowed to set up and make plays . Both goalies made standup saves as the play picked up considerably . McLean made three great saves in the second off a dancing Teammu Selanne while Essensa was rocked by a Pavel Bure drive . Selanne looked dangerous on the rush as the Jets pressed a series of attacks into the Canuck zone . The Canucks , on the other hand , looked like they were offering four checking lines in an effort to preserve their slim lead . A series of minor penalties at the end of the second period resulted in a one man advantage for the Jets in the early third . The Jet 's Tempo Numminen drove a puck from the point through McLean's legs and into the net to tie the game at 2-2 . The Canuck 's discordant play picked up where it left off . This was characterized by long lead passes that either never connected or were picked off by the Jets and individual rushes into a tight Winnipeg defence that were never supported . However , as in the first and second Canuck goals , a Jet defensive lapse ( re : bonehead play ) stalled the Winnipeg comeback . With the faceoff in the Winnipeg zone , Pavel Bure was left to stand in the crease with no Jet defender anywhere near him . Bure , who had been invisible in the game up to that point , took a rebound and managed to roof it with a backhand even though he was off balance . By then it was too late for the Jets to come back . Essensa made it to the bench with one minute to go but the extra attacker did nothing for their attack . Canucks 3 , Winnipeg 2 . Next game is Friday at Winnipeg with the Jets in the hole by two games . - 30 -

I had the same inconvenience when I bought my EX-500 ; only I could at least go 50 mph during the initial break-in . Despite the high quality of motor oils and motorcycle engines these days , I would follow the instructions , and just keep to city street riding for the first 500 miles . Heck , those miles go by fast , and it 's worth it to know you have n't possibly screwed up your engine . At the same time , this has all the makings of a 6-week-long thread debating the whole break-in topic . Alan

That 's not all it says . The coverage of modifiers is in Chapter 8 of Volume Four ( or chap 7 in older Athena editions ) , where there is about 10 pages on how to specify translations to capture various combinations of keys or buttons . The Xlib route uses XLookupString and there is a lot of coverage of how that works in Volume One , chapter 9 . You should read this to understand how all the mappings work before trying to do anything complicated . Adrian Nye O'Reilly and Associates
