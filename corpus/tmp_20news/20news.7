Organization : Netcom Online Communications Services ( 408-241-9760 login : guest ) Lines : 16 Dear Netters , My sister has an Apple 12 '' Color Display hooked up to an LC . Problem : There is an annoying , horizontal , ghost-like stripe that precesses vertically about once per second . It is about 1 cm high . She is in grave danger of going insane because of it . Any ideas of what it might be and how I might cure it for her ? -Joe Betts betts @ netcom.com PS : if I pick up the display ( I thought it might be RFI from the LC ) it seems to get worse !

They are popular vehicles . You do n't see a lot of previous model year ones sitting on dealer 's lots for any lenghth of time after the new ones are out . The things sell , they are popular . Because they are popular , and high-priced new , they are high price used , very simple . I knew they were overpriced when I bought it ... I knew they had a terrible reliability record when I bought it . But I did n't expect anything like I got , especially with a dealer network unable to repair it .

THE PROGRAM : Crypto'93 is the thirteenth in a series of workshops on cryptology held at Santa Barbara , and is sponsored by the International Association for Cryptologic Research , in cooperation with the IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Security and Privacy , the Computer Science Department of the University of California , Santa Barbara , and Bell-Northern Research ( a subsidiary of Northern Telecom ) . The program for the workshop will cover all aspects of cryptology . Extended abstracts of the papers presented at the conference will be distributed to all attendees at the conference , and formal proceedings will be published at a later date . In addition to the regular program of papers selected or invited by the program committee , there will be a rump session on Tuesday evening for informal presentations . Facilities will also be provided for attendees to demonstrate hardware , software and other items of cryptographic interest . If you wish to demonstrate such items , you are urged to contact the General Chair so that your needs will be attended to . The social program will include hosted cocktail parties on Sunday and Monday . In addition , there will be a beach barbecue on Wednesday evening . The price of the barbecue is included in the room and board charge , and extra tickets may be purchased . ABOUT THE CONFERENCE FACILITIES : The workshop will be held on the campus of the University of California , Santa Barbara . The campus is located adjacent to the Santa Barbara airport and the Pacific Ocean . Accommodations are available in the university dormitories at relatively low cost for conference participants . Children under the age of 13 are not allowed to stay in the dormitories , so those bringing small children will need to make separate arrangements in one of several nearby hotels .

For those who choose not to stay in the dormitories , the following is a partial list of hotels in the area . Those who choose to stay off campus are responsible for making their own reservations , and early reservations are advised since August is a popular season in Santa Barbara .

All prices are subject to change ; prices should be confirmed by calling the individual hotels directly . However , mention CRYPTO'93 when you are making your reservation and in several of the hotels listed you will be eligible for the university rate which can be significantly less than the normal rates . We are not able to block rooms in these hotels , so please make reservations as early as possible .

My response to the `` shooting down '' of a Turkish airplane over the Armenian air space was because of the IGNORANT posting of the person from your Country . Turks and Azeris consistantly WANT to drag ARMENIA into the KARABAKH conflict with Azerbaijan . The KARABAKHI-ARMENIANS who have lived in their HOMELAND for 3000 years ( CUT OFF FROM ARMENIA and GIVEN TO AZERIS BY STALIN ) are the ones DIRECTLY involved in the CONFLICT . They are defending themselves against AZERI AGGRESSION . Agression that has NO MERCY for INOCENT people that are costantly SHELLED with MIG-23 's and othe Russian aircraft . At last , I hope that the U.S. insists that Turkey stay out of the KARABAKH crisis so that the repeat of the CYPRUS invasion WILL NEVER OCCUR again .

Well , let me see . UZI , no . M-11/9 , no . M-16/AR-15 , maybe . I remember there being a selector swtich on the AR-15 . If I remember correctly ( please correct me if I 'm wrong ) the switch would set to an `` off '' position or an `` on '' position because the gun ( AR-15 ) is semi-automatic . Would n't the M-16 have a position for semi-auto fire and full-auto fire ( or maybe 3 round bursts ) ? If this is correct would n't it be easy to distinguish each gun by this alone ? Of course if the AR-15 were modified to full-auto fire I would n't think it would be that easy but I 'm talking about distinguishing between an unmodified AR-15 and M-16 . How about the other guns ?

IMO , given the various ages of the Braves and Reds this season , that the Braves will be closer to their peak , while the Reds have slightly passed their peak . Also , if you 're going to compare Braves and Yankees , a more appropriate comparison to the '93 Braves might be the '23 Yankees .

Well , yes , the exhaust is where the majority of the noise comes out , but the basics ( tone , firing cadence , etc . ) are determined by the engine configuration . In the case of the Viper , yes , we are discussing a HUGE multicylinder 90-deg . engine , which will sound somewhat like a truck . And my understanding , btw , is that that V-10 engine was designed originally with the intention of being ad- aptible for either the trucks or the Viper . And from what I 've heard ( no first hand knowledge : - ( ) it 's doing a pretty good job at both . And the best exhaust sound in the world is now and will always be a 60-degree DOHC Colombo-designed V-12 . Period . Michael T.

Good point . The New Testament does not quote Ezra , Nehemiah , Esther , Ruth , Job , Ecclesiastes , or Song of Songs , just as it does not quote from the Deuterocanon . But if the non-quotation of the former does not disqualify them , neither does the non-quotation of the later . And the Wisodm of Solomon was quite clearly an influence on St. Paul , especially in the letter to the Romans ( cf especially Romans 1.18-32 and Wisdom 13-14 ) .

Not all accepted them as Scripture , though niether were all the books of the New Testament so accepted , which puts to the lie the whole argument of the books being excluded because they were debated and not universally accepted . Hebrews , the Apocalypse , 2 Peter , Esther , and others were debated at various times , but eventually retained . As for the Codexes you mention , both Vaticanus and Sinaitcus include the Deuterocanon , bothe of the New and Old Testaments , and Vaticanus ( I think ) inlcudes 1 Clement , the Shepard of Hermas , and the Epistle of Baranabas . As for the Muratorian Canon , it deals with the New Testament only , though it is very valuable in its witness to those books . > My interim conclusion is that Protestant exclusion of > ( at least one of ) these writings is one of those 'traditions > of men ' one hears of so often .

( If all else fails : - ) > Show me where I 'm wrong . You 're not wrong ! It is a ` tradition of men ' to exlcude them , as I will explain below . `` That nothing be read in the Church under the nmae of Divine Scripture , except the canonical Scriptures , and the canoncial Scriptures are - Genesis , Exodus , Leviticus , Numbers , Deuteronomy , Joshua , Judges , Ruth , Four books of Kingdoms [ being 1 & 2 Samuel and 1 & 2 Kings ] , Two books of Paralpomenon [ being 1 & 2 Chronicles ] , Job , the Psalter of David , the Five books of Solomon [ being Proverbs , Ecclesiastes , Song of Songs , Wisdom of Solomon , and [ misatributed to him ] the Wisdom of Jesus son of Sirach ] , The books of the Twelve ( Minor ) Prophets , Isaiah , Jeremiah [ being Jeremiah , the Lamentations , Baruch , and the Letter , all of which were formerly counted as one ] , Ezekiel , Daniel , Tobit , Judith , Esther , Two books of Ezra [ being Ezra and Nehemiah ] , Two books of Maccabees . And of the New Testament : Four books of the Gospel , One book of the Acts of the Apostles , Thirteen letters of Paul the Apostle , One Letter of the same to the Hebrews , two of Peter the Apostle , Three of John , One of the Apostle Jude , One of the Apostle James , One book of the Apocalypse of John . '' -Council of Hippo , Statute 36 , ( 393 AD ) This same list was promulgated again at the Third Council of Carthage ( 397 AD ) , and at the Sixth Council of Carthage ( 419 AD ) - at which council the same list was enumerated with the words `` Because we have recieved from the Fathers that these are the books to be read in the Church . '' Which ought to quiet those who assert `` in the name of Holy Scripture we do understand those books of whose authority there was never any doubt in the Church , '' as the Episcopal Church does in removing the Deuterocanon from the realm of Scripture . ( Though the Episcopalians hold them in high regard and read them in the Church , they are not counted as Scripture by them , and may not be used to prove dogma . The Lutherans hold out similarly . ) Earlier mention of the so-called Apocrypha as divine scripture can also be found , and below I inlcude only a portion of the quotes calling it divine scripture that could be found among the writings of the Fathers . `` And this is the reason why the Law of the old Testament is reckoned as consisting of twenty-two books : so that they may correspond to the number of letters [ in the Hebrew alphabet ] ... . It is to be noted also that by adding to these Tobias and Judith , there are twenty-four books , corresponding to the number of letters used by the Greeks . '' -St. Hillary of Poitiers , `` Commentaries on the Psalms , '' prologue , 15 ( 365 AD ) '' The twenty-two books according to the Hebrews are ... .

'' -St. Melito of Sardes , fragment found in Eusebius ' `` History of the Church , '' and dating from crica 177 AD , Book 4 , 26 , 14 '' It is likewise decreed : Now , indeed , we must treat of the divine Scriptures : what the universal Catholic Church accepts and what she must shun . The list of the Old Testament ... . Wisdom , one book ; Ecclesiasticus , one book ... . Tobit , one book ... . Judith , one book ; of Maccabees , two books . '' -St. Damasus I , Pope , `` The Decree of Damsus , '' section 2 ( 382 AD ) I would think this enough , though more can be shown , that the Church has always accepted the deutero-canon , though parts have been disputed by various persons . For if disputes involving the New Testament deutero-canon does not disqulaify those books ( i.e . Hebrews , James , 2 Peter , 2 & 3 John , Jude , Revelation ) in Protestant eyes , than neither should it disqulaify the Old Testament books . And I must point out that the Jews only drew up their canon in 90 AD , 60 years after the founding of the Christian Religion upon the Cross . Why should we adhere to a canon that was drawn up by the faithless , in reaction to the Chrsitian use of the Greek Septuagint , which includes the deutero-canon ? As early as 150 AD , St. Justin had already accused the Jews of mutilating the Canon of Scripture by their removal of certain books . Protestants apparently prefer to think that God 's revelation was limited by a decree of the Jews in the ordering of their ( the Jews ' ) faithless canon , and that he could not use other people , like the Apostles , in drawing up the canon . The Apostles were most certain users of the Septuagint , as some 80 % of the Old Testament quotes use the wording of the Septuagint , and not the Hebrew . And the Septuagint includes the Deuterocanon .

It sounds like you 're suggesting Bill James had something to do with overhyping the kid to death .

He 's a much better hitter , although Hernandez is n't a *bad* hitter . Right now , it sounds like Piazza will catch most of the time and Hernandez will be Candiotti 's caddy since he can catch the knuckler . As long as they play up to their abilities , the Dodgers could have a very good catching tandem . > The Braves options are Berryhill and Olson .

But both the Braves ' catchers are very > good defensively ( calling a game , blocking the plate , throwing ) > and although they are somewhat weak offenivsively , they play on a team > that is not so much in need of another big bat . I think both are overrated defensively ( see Nichols ' Law of catcher defense ) , but that 's something that 's difficult to prove or disprove from your viewpoint or mine . About the only tangible thing we can look at is opponent 's SB % , and that 's clouded by how well your pitchers hold runners . Catchers ERA is a possibility , but it 's subject to way too many biases . As for them 'playing on a team that is not so much in need of another big bat ' , I disagree here too . About the only chink in the Braves ' armor is that they 're weak offensively at several positions ( CF , C , 2B , SS if Belliard plays , 1B unless Bream and Hunter form another super-platoon ) and very weak defensively if Blauser plays . I 'd like to see the Braves give at least one of Mel Nieves , Javy Lopez or Chipper Jones a shot , but much like the talent-rich Jays of recent years they 'll be conservative and stick with what they have .

There was a > demand , so an entire industry formed to supply it . If alcohol were again banned today , it would be MUCH more difficult to manage a large-scale smuggling operation . The cops now rank just a narrow notch below the military in communications , intelligence gathering and firepower . In a similar vein , the amount of marijuana smuggled into this country has greatly decreased . This is because its value-per-pound is very low when compared to cocaine or heroin . It 's simply not worth the risk , it 's uneconomical . Now , most reefer is domestic . There is less pressure on the domestic producer ( showy raids notwithstanding ) and thus it is economical . Of note though ... domestic reefer is now very strong , so a small volume goes a long way . You can not make alcohol stronger than 200 proof - not a good dollar/pound deal . Firearms tend to fall into this low dollar/pound area . It would not be economic to smuggle them in . All production would have to be local . There are not all that many people who have both the skill AND motivation to assemble worthwhile firearms from scratch . High-ranking crime figures could obtain imported Uzis and such , but the average person , and average thug , would be lucky to get a zip-gun - and would pay through the nose for it .

Basically get the eci-freaks to make it so hard to get the minerals on earth.. You think this is crazy . Well in a way it is , but in a way it is reality . There is a billin the congress to do just that.. Basically to make it so expensive to mine minerals in the US , unless you can by off the inspectors or tax collectors.. ascially what I understand from talking to a few miner friends of mine , that they ( the congress ) propose to have a tax on the gross income of the mine , versus the adjusted income , also the state governments have there normal taxes . So by the time you get done , paying for materials , workers , and other expenses you can owe more than what you made . BAsically if you make a 1000.00 and spend 500. ofor expenses , you can owe 600.00 in federal taxes.. Bascially it is driving the miners off the land.. And the only peopel who benefit are the eco-freaks.. Basically to get back to my beginning statement , is space is the way to go cause it might just get to expensive to mine on earth because of either the eco-freaks or the protectionist.. Such fun we have in these interesting times.. == Michael Adams , nsmca @ acad3.alaska.edu -- I 'm not high , just jacked

Nntp-Posting-Host : rainier.ho.att.com Lines : 58 Fascinating . Most of the content of the White House announcements was in what was *not* said . It gives us almost nothing of value , threatens to take away a lot , and does it with a sincere smile on its face , and the nice friendly word `` Management '' . FACT SHEET PUBLIC ENCRYPTION MANAGEMENT The first thing it does n't say is `` We 're giving you stronger encryption '' . what it says is the U. S. Government has developed a microcircuit that not only provides privacy through encryption that is substantially more robust than the current government standard , but also permits escrowing of the keys needed to unlock the encryption . The system for the escrowing of keys will allow the government to gain access to encrypted information only with appropriate legal authorization . But DES is strong enough that only the government can break it now , so the major effect is to make it EASIER for government to break ! *At best* it makes it more difficult for the NSA to break , since they need to get one of the two escrowed keys to do a brute-force search for the other 40-bit key . Similarly , it did n't say `` We 're making encryption is commercially available . '' because encryption *is* already commercially available , including forms the NSA may not be able to break , like triple-DES or IDEA . And phone companies could offer DES-based systems *now* if they were convinced the government would let them and they could make enough money . The next thing it did n't say is `` We 're making encryption legal '' , because of course encryption *has always been* legal , and the President ca n't change the First Amendment merely by decree . What it *did* say was : In making this decision , I do not intend to prevent the private sector from developing , or the government from approving , other microcircuits or algorithms that are equally effective in assuring both privacy and a secure key- escrow system . which clearly means `` We 're making encryption illegal unless we get your keys . Soon . Once business buys into this . '' Another thing it did n't say is `` We 're going to ask Congress for money to do *lots* more wiretapping '' , because of course , there 's a budget crisis , and Congress might debate the policy issues or not give them the cash . What it *did* say was : The Attorney General will procure and utilize encryption devices to the extent needed to preserve the government 's ability to conduct lawful electronic surveillance and to fulfill the need for secure law enforcement communications . Further , the Attorney General shall utilize funds from the Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture Super Surplus Fund to effect this purchase . which means `` We 've got money Congress ca n't control and we 're going to buy lots of wiretapping equipment with it to detect NON-APPROVED CRYPTO ( that 's what `` preserve the government 's ability to conduct ... surveillance '' means . ) -- # Pray for peace ; Bill # Bill Stewart 1-908-949-0705 wcs @ anchor.att.com AT & T Bell Labs 4M312 Holmdel NJ # No , I 'm *from* New Jersey , I only *work* in cyberspace ... . # White House Commect Line 1-202-456-1111 fax 1-202-456-2461

Instead , it looks like that > ill-gotten gain will be used to help pay for wiretap equipment . I wholeheartedly agree . Knowing that WE have let our law enforcement agencies seize our property against the Fifth Amendment of OUR Constitution tells me that we are absolving ourselves of our responsibility for SELF-GOVERNANCE . WE have to take our government back from the self-serving politicians who create laws and rules only to better their positions within the government . WE have allowed them to take too much power from the people of this nation . That situation has to be changed . Allowing the law enforcement agencies to use the seized property to pay-off drug informants who lie and continue to deal in drugs is tantamount to making a pact with the Devil himself . It 's a vicious cycle . The law enforcement agencies are motivated to seize property to fund their own activities . And having no easy way for the citizen to regain the property intact once taken gives even more incentive for the agencies to take property . It 's also interesting to note that two months ago Rush Limbaugh said that Clinton would have the `` plumbers '' out in force shortly . Clinton and his henchmen firmly believe in strong ubiquitous government control . Anytime a leader believes in that , the leader will use every means possible to retain that control and take more . WE have to take OUR government back . Otherwise we will end up living in the equivalent of a high-tech third world dictatorship . We have to take responsibility for ourselves , our personal welfare , and our actions . __ Paul J.

From : edw @ boi.hp.com ( Edward Walsh ) Subject : Guzzi 850-T tires , plus fairing question Organization : Hewlett-Packard / Boise , Idaho X-Newsreader : Tin 1.1 PL4 Lines : 59 I have a question about tires for my Guzzi . It is a '75 850-T . The tires that were on it when I just bought it are old and cracked . I do not have an owners manual for it ( yet ) , but the tires listed in the Haynes manual are : Front , 3,50 H 18 ; Rear 4.10 H 18 , and pressures recommended are 26 front and 33 rear . Oddly , the pressure for the same tire on the T-3 is listed at 29 psi instead . Anyone know the reason ? As I know though , the pressure I should run at is that recommended by the manufacturer of the new tires I purchase . The real question I have is this . The old tires that are on the bike are for the front , a Metzler Touring Special , 4.10 H 18 , and for the rear an Avon Roadrunner 4.70 H 18 , ( 120/90 ) H 18 as marked on each tire . Both are larger than that listed in the Haynes Manual . What does the owners manual recommend , and was it common to go up one size for this bike ? Also , this will be my first motorcycle with innertubes . Any comments on the various manufacturers inner tube qualities ? The above sizes are inches ( except for the additional mark on the current rear tire ) . What is the best metric match ? The local BMW dealer thought 100/90 H 18 on the front and 120/90 H 18 on the back . He also happens to be very good at getting close to matching mail order prices . I am thinking of going with a Metzler ME33 Laser ( possibly Comp K ) on the front and ME88 on the back , both in MBS variety if possible ( the longer lasting belting system ) . I already use the ME33 on both the Vision and FJ for the front , and like it , and I thought that with the shaft drive behavior and torque from the Guzzi that the ME88 might give more predictable back end control and sliding behavior than a ME55 might , as well as giving much better tire milage life . Any comments ? A friend told me he thought that my bike had Boranni rims which are very good , but are relatively soft and have delicate sidewalls . I do not wish to mount the tires myself this first time , so aside from warning the shop to be careful , any other comments I should make ? I hav n't looked at the rim to check out the make yet , if it is marked . He just told me late yesterday and I hav n't had a chance to check the rim type . On another note . I will remove the ugly ( but in good shape ... .anyone want it ? ) Vetter fairing , and I will run without a windscreen for a while , but eventually I would like a simple rounded cafe ' style quarter fairing for it . It could be fork/handlebar mounted . Any suggestions ? Is there such a thing as a frame mounted quarter fairing of the cafe ' style for this bike ? How about lower bars/clip-ons for it ? I would like to restore the bike into a good condition runner with a few modern updates , but while not being historically exactly accurate still have it reflect relatively well a representation of the cafe' style . ( Yes I know to be picky , that period really predates this bike ... .it is just that this bike has such potential for _that_ look . ) -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -Edward Walsh -- -- Hewlett-Packard Company -- -- -- - edw @ boi.hp.com Disk Memory Division , MS475 ( 208 ) 323-2174 P.O .

Would > this mixing be substantially faster/slower at the pressures we're > talking about ? There was an interesting article in Scientific American some time ago about breathing liquid . ( It was a few months before _The Abyss_ came out . ) As far as I can remember , they mentioned three things that were difficult to do at once with a substitute breathing fluid : - low viscosity -- - if it 's too difficult to force the fluid in & out of the lungs , you ca n't extract enough oxygen to power your own breathing effort ( let alone anything else ) - diffusion rate -- - obviously , not all the air in your lungs is expelled when you breathe out ; and the part that is n't expelled is the part that 's nearest the walls of the alveoli . ( alveolus ? ) So the trip from the blood vessels to the new air has to be done by diffusion of the gas through the fluid . Apparently oxygen tends to diffuse more readily than CO2 , so even if you can get enough oxygen in , you might not be able to get enough CO2 out . - oxygen/CO2 capacity -- - you have to be able to dissolve enough gas per unit volume . Oh , and of course , your new breathing fluid must not irritate the lungs or interfere with their healing or anything like that ... -- Wim Lewis , wiml @ u.washington.edu

From : nlu @ Xenon.Stanford.EDU ( Nelson Lu ) Subject : SHARKS REVIEW Part 2 : Defensemen ( 2-19 ) Organization : Computer Science Department , Stanford University . Lines : 92 I finally got it back , with great thanks to Mark Spiegel for saving and sending it . # 2 ROB ZETTLER Season : 4th Acquired : '91-92 , from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade : C/C- Zettler gave the Sharks every bit he 's got this year ; unfortunately , this still was n't enough to make him any more than a marginal NHLer , if that . He works hard , for sure , but is no better than average on defense , and is prone to costly penalties and defensive lapses at times , while being basically an offensive zero ( 0 goal and 7 assists in 79 games ) . He would be hardpressed to make the team next year . # 3 DAVID WILLIAMS Season : 2nd Acquired : '91-92 , free agent from New Jersey Grade : C/C- IMO , Williams was the most valuable defenseman for the Sharks in '91-92 , playing a combination of good offense ( 3 goals and 25 assists in 56 games ) and good defense . But he , playing the first part of this season in Kansas City , was good neither offensively nor defensively this year ; it , then , appears that '91-92 was a fluke . Although he improved towards the end of the season , he was prone to being out of position defensively , and did not demonstrate the playmaking skills that made him the team 's leading scorer among defensemen last year . He would also be hardpressed to make the team next year . # 4 JAYSON MORE Season : 2nd Acquired : '91-92 , from Montreal in expansion draft Grade : B+ After being touted as the team 's top defensive prospects in training camp before '91-92 , More had a rather disappointing '91-92 , as he was not particularly good defensively , and had just 17 points in 46 games . He , then , proceeded to improve his game massively this season , becoming the team 's most reliable defenseman , whom the team can count on night in and night out to play steady defense and providing occasional ( but only occasional ) offensive flash . Offensively , he was even more disappointing than last year ( 11 points in 73 games ) , but his defense improved tremendously . He is probably best as the defensive part of a defense combination with an offensive defenseman . # 5 NEIL WILKINSON Season : 4th Acquired : '91-92 , from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade : B- Wilkinson was probably the team 's top defensive defenseman in '91-92 . However , partially because of injuries , he was not the same this year , as he missed 25 games total due to nagging knee and back injuries , and seemed to be slowed even when playing . He , then , had often to be saved by his defensive partners ; that is , if they are there at all . But he also had some solid games , and if he can be complete healthy , he can still be a force . # 6 SANDIS OZOLINSH Season : 1st Acquired : '91-92 , 2nd round pick in entry draft Grade : I ( A ) At the time of his injury ( December 30 , against the Philadelphia Flyers ) , Ozolinsh was well on track to be , IMO , the team 's MVP . A serious knee injury in that game , though , forced him to miss the rest of the season ( 47 games ) , but he still finished as the team 's top scorer among defensemen ( 23 points ) , which , of course , tells more about the lack of offense the Sharks had from their defensemen , but it also tells of Ozolinsh 's abilities . At the time , he was playing very good defense along with excellent offense ; he was still susceptible to so-called `` rookie mistakes , '' but was probably the defenseman who made the least of them on the team , rookie or veteran . If he can come back from his injuries , he is ready to be a star . # 19 DOUG ZMOLEK Season : 1st Acquired : '91-92 , from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade : B Zmolek had basically a solid and durable year , being one of the only two Sharks to play in all 84 games of the season . He was solid on defense , but after being billed as an offensive defenseman , he did n't show it ( 15 points ) . He was also prone to penalties , and his 229 penalty minutes was second on the team ; however , that was also an indication that he was fearly when facing tough physical opponents , and he was at his best when playing physically . But to become a fixture in this league , he needs to improve both offensively and defensively , and cut down on the number of power-plays he gives to opponents . =============================================================================== GO CALGARY FLAMES !

By default the parallel printer processor does not enable it 's interrupt line therefore no Int 0x0F 's will be sourced from the printer controller chip , thus enabling other devices to use the actual IRQ7 . Note , this applies to COM ports also which by default do not route interrupts to the system bus , although COM 's software usually enable this feature as it make monitoring COM port activity easier than polling the serial UART , thus probably getting the sound card slighty confused ! .

If Windows needs a swap file , it will upo and create one if a permanent one does n't exist . Permanent is generally faster though .

'' Strictly speaking , you 're right - we ca n't repent _for_ somebody else , for what they 've done . I guess I do n't think it 's out of line to talk about a generalized repentence for our contribution to or participation in `` The sins of society '' , or for our tacit approval ( by our silence ) of sinful attitudes or practices ... .it may be that we 're also just plain begging for mercy , hoping God will withhold his hand of judgement on our whole country for the sake of a few , much as Abraham sought to do for the sake of Lot . ( Hmmm , the results there were pretty cautionary ... ) A few times lately when I 've observed some either out-and-out sinful activity , or just some self-destructive activity , I 've gotten a strong impression that many folks really do n't know any better . Christ 's pity on the crowds as being `` like sheep without a shepherd '' rings true to me . If these folks do n't have a clue , do I bear _any_ responsibility for my not having communicated a better way ? Worse still ; have I expressed judgement and disgust at their doings , and thus alienated them from any positive relationship whereby I might pass along anything positive ? I _know_ I 've got something to repent about on that score .

Punch Imlach 's contributions as a coach and GM were far greater than those of the above combined . Should we name a division or trophy after him ? Smythe and Norris and the bunch were honoured purely because they were powerful owners . As owners they certainly did help to build the league but whether they developed the game is another question altogether .

What have you heard ? The Major was the *definitive* little asshole ! He originated the phrase `` if you ca n't beat 'em in the alley you ca n't beat 'em on the ice . '' That was his idea of hockey . Do you think , by chance , that Don Cherry is a classy individual ? > Also , is n't the point of `` professional '' hockey to make money > for all those involved , which would include the players .

The money issue is irrelevant to the point that we would agree on , and that is : `` it is the players that are what make the game great and not the people who put them on the ice '' Exactly true . Naming divisions and trophies after Smythe and the bunch is the same kind of nepotism that put Stein in the hall of fame .

All present Macs support the use of 32-bit color through 32-bit color QuickDraw in ROM . 32-bit color QuickDraw allows an almost transparent capability to display and edit X-bit images in Y- bit color and retain ALL the colors of Y-bit color [ Where X and Y independently are 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 , or 32 ] regardless of monitor resolution { 63 dpi [ 12 '' color ] to 94 dpi [ PaletteBook ] } or monitor type { including autosynchronous VGA , MCGA and SVGA monitors with ranges including 66.7 hz vertically and 35 kHz horizontally and only a hardware video adaptor ( MacUser Aug 1992 : 158-176 ) . Older machines that supported color { SE/30 , II , IIX , and IIcx } had only 8-bit color in ROM and needed a software patch to use 32-bit color ( MacUser Special 1993:28-29 ) . To keep costs down and speed up most Macs have only 8 or 16 bit display capability built-in , but most of those can be expanded to display 24-bit color . Presently QuickDraw is optimized for 72 dpi display ; QuickDraw QX will change this . In addition , QuickDraw allows , in Macs with a NuBus slot , more then one monitor to be used in any combination , from two monitors showing the same thing to multiple monitors acting as one large large monitor with any degree of overlap of the pictures . VRAM : Video RAM . Standard for present non-PowerBook Mac 's handling of built-in video { from a 32-bit color palette } . VRAM provided runs a 8-bit color 640x480 display ; expandable to 16-bit color or a 8-bit 832x624 display . Sound output : Standard in all Macs since the 128K . Stereo sound became standard with the SE/30 . IBM : Even though PCs have ROM BIOS definitions of how the operating system interacts with the video hardware ( Nan Zou ) , the use of drivers bypassing BIOS , video hareware inconsitancies { see Super VGA below } and nonstanderzation of clone BIOS have left resolution of video display hardware , OS and program interaction up to the OS and video hardware in question ( Faisal Nameer Jawdat ) . In addition , IBM and clone makers never bothered to provide a standard hardware mechanism for software to determine what display mode is actually present ( Matt Healy ) nor a standardized screen-drawing toolbox { like Mac 's QD } . As a result the OS must be very well written to detect some modes , especially with some third party cards or to use them consitantly { At present things are so dependent on the interaction of the program , OS , print driver and monitor card that editing 32-bit pictures regardless of color mode , OS , and monitor type/card combination as one can do on the Mac is impossible with an IBM . For example , one can not edit a 32-bit color picture done on a OS/2 486 with a SVGA monitor on a 386 with VGA { 18-bit color palette } and DOS 5.0 and still have ALL the colors one started out with } . Later IBM machines will have integrated graphics accelerators , faster processors , and modular upgradeability and may have built-in sound cards , CD ROM , and Ethernet ( PC Week 12/14/92 ) . MDA : Monocrome Display Adapter original character-mapped video mode , no graphics , 80x25 text . CGA : Color Graphics Array 320x200 4 colors or 640x200 b/w , 16 color palette , bad for the eyes . EGA : Enhanced Graphics Array 640x350 16 colors from 64 color palette [ and some lower res ] ; some versions could run at 256 colors , bearable on the eyes . VGA : Video Graphics Array* 320x200 at 256 colors , 640x480 at 16 colors , and some others , these two are the most commonly used . All modes have a 256K CLUT , from a 18 to 24-bit { IBM } or a 32-bit { Mac } color palette . 25.175 MHz Pixel Clock ( Mel Martinez ) . Monitors use analog input , incompatible with TTL signals from EGA/CGA etc . MCGA : Multi-Color Graphics Array* subset of VGA that provides all the features of MDA & CGA , but lacks some EGA and VGA modes , like VGA 640x480x16 ( Dictionary of Computer Terms-DCT ) . Common on the initial PS/1 implementation from IBM and some PS/2 Models . SVGA : Super VGA* This is not a standard in the way the others were , but instead was a 'catch all ' category for a group of video cards . As such , with each manufacturer using their own implementation scheme , SVGA was chaos with people debating as to what is SVGA and what is not . In an effort to make SVGA more of a standard VESA was established and is used in the newer units , but things are still a mess . Video is either 512K [ ~1990 ] or 1M [ today ] , resolution of 800x600 and 1024x768 at 16 and 256 colors are common , newer ones [ since 1990 ] have the Sierra HiColor RAMDAC , giving 15-bit 32,768 colors at 800x600 , some of the very newer ones [ ~6/92 ] can do 24 bits per pixel [ usually at 640x480 ] . Speedwise , too much variation , some very slow [ Western Digital Paradise based , for example ] , some very fast [ S3 86C911 based , for example ] , some are so-so [ like Tseng ET4000 , a very popular chipset ] . Some limiting factors overcome by 40MHz VL Bus & 386 's linear address mapping were : 8.33 MHz ISA bus , AT architecture where the CPU looks at the card through a 64K `` window '' , etc . Other non-SVGA standards : 8514/a : IBM 's own standard , interlacing graphics accelerator with graphics functions like linedraw , polygon fill , etc . in hardware . Some clone implementations from ATI are the fastest video available today , though some clone models do not have interlacing . TMS34010/34020 : high end graphics co-processors , usually > $ 1000 , some do 24-bit , speeds up vector-oriented graphics like CAD . XGA : eXtended Graphics Array newer and faster than 8514/a , only available for MCA bus-based PS/2s , clones are coming out soon . Emulates VGA , EGA , and CGA ( DCT ) . Max resolution at 1024x768x8b , same as 8514/a , also some 16 bpp modes . XGA-2 Accelerates graphics functions up to 20 times faster than standard VGA in Windows and OS/2 , including line draws , bit and pixel-block transfers , area fills , masking and X/Y addressing . Has an intelligent way to detect and co- exist with other XGA-2 cards , so multiple desktops like on the Mac may not be far away . Since this is an architecture , its resolution and color depth is n't fixed { IBM implements only 16-bit [ 65,536 ] color , while other companies can have 24-bit color through IBM technical licenses } . Refresh rates up to 75 Hz , ensures flicker free , rock solid images to reduce visual discomfort , and is VGA compatible . Up to 1280x1024 on OS/2 . *some monitor types usable by Mac-See Mac section above for specific details . Expansion Both Mac & IBM SCSI : only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM . Allows the use of any device : hard drive , printer , scanner , Nubus card expansion { Mac Plus only } , some monitors , and CD-ROM . Main problem : there are a lot of external devices which are internal terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port { A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and at the end . Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM } . SCSI-1 : 7 devices per SCSI controller . 8-bit asynchronous { ~1.5MB/s ave } and synchronous { 5MB/s max } transfers . Difference is due to SCSI-1 software drivers . `` Fast SCSI-1 '' is a misname for 8-bit SCSI-2 in SCSI-1 mode { see SCSI-2 for details } . SCSI-2 : 10 devices per SCSI controller in SCSI-2 mode . SCSI-2 is fully SCSI-1 compliant and 8-bit SCSI-2 tends to be implemented as a very fast SCSI-1 since it does not require the different controller interfaces in hardware and software that 16 and 32-bit SCSI-2 do . Transfer speeds are 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst { 8-bit } , 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst { 16-bit } , and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst { 32-bit/wide and fast } . Since 8-bit SCSI-2 can use SCSI-1 software drivers and hardware at 8-bit SCSI-2 speeds and as such is limited to 7 devices sometimes it is mistakenly called `` fast SCSI-1 '' . 16-bit fast SCSI-2 requires a SCSI-2 software driver and SCSI-2 electronics but can still use the SCSI-1 ports . Wide 16-bit and 32-bit SCSI-2 require a different SCSI port , electronics , and software driver from SCSI-1 { Which makes them more expensive than other SCSI interfaces } . Mac SCSI : asynchronous SCSI-1 built-in standard since the Plus . Even though Apple developed some specifications for SCSI controlers , the OS SCSI Manager needs to be rewritten to take full advantage of the features of both SCSI interfaces . As a result present SCSI-2 Macs use 8-bit SCSI-2 as a fast asynchronous SCSI-1 . Presently Quadras are the only Macs with a SCSI-2 controller chip built-in ( Digital Review , Oct 21 , 1991 v8 n33 p8 ( 1 ) ) though they lack some other parts of the hardware , like the wide SCSI-2 port interface . Since other Macs require a NuBus card to use SCSI-2 , older NuBus Macs had a bottleneck due to the speed of the NuBus and CPU . Rumor-some Cyclone Macs { June } will come with a wide & fast SCSI-2 port standard and have a rewritten OS SCSI manager . IBM SCSI : SCSI-1 is not too wide spread yet , generally not bundled with systems , except as add-on { EISA and VESA Local Bus adapters avalable } . Like the Mac , 8-bit SCSI-2 is used as a very fast SCSI-1 by most controllers out there . Unlike the Mac , IBM has no exact SCSI controller specifications which results in added incompatibilities for SCSI . Mac Memory expansion : with a few exceptions the Mac has used non-parity 30-pin 8-bit SIMM memory expansion since the Plus . While 32-pin 9-bit parity SIMMs could be used in these Macs , only special IIcis could make use of the parity feature { By convension both SIMM types are called 32-pin SIMMs } . The IIfx used 64-pin parity SIMMs . The LC III , C610/650 and Q800 all use a new 72-pin SIMM that is accessable by 32-bits at a time and is used in IBMs . The Mac does a complete memory check at startup by writing/reading every memory location ; if something is seriously wrong with a SIMM the Mac will not boot and give a sound chord indicating what the problem is . Since Macs made before Feb 15 , 1993 managed memory baced on data path , SIMMs had to be installed in pairs { 16-bit } or in sets of 4 { 32-bit } . The Centris 650 and Quadra 800 eliminate this with a new memory management setup that allows memory to be upgraded one SIMM at a time . If the SIMMs are the same size are used then the memory is 'interleaved ' across the two SIMMs resulting in a 10-15 % performance boost on RAM access ( MacWorld Apr 93 : 108-109 ) . Printers , ADBs , and modems : built-in interfaces standard . Monitor interface and sound input : built-in on most present macs . PDS : Available in SE & all present non-Powerbook Macs . 16-bit { SE , Portable , LC , LC II , Classic line } and 32-bit . Operates at CPU 's MHz . Maximum through put : data path in bytes*CPU 's MHz { Q700/900 & C650 : 4 * 25Mhz = 100MB/s ; Q800 & Q950 : 4 * 33Mhz = 132MB/s } . Standardized with the LC and 040 bus designs . With an adapter one NuBus card can be used in IIsi and C610 . Problem : some cards have timing dependency which slows through put down . NuBus Mac II : 32-bit , 10 MHz bus clock , 1-to-1 transaction/bus cycle ratio , and contiguous , hand-shake transactions at ~10-20MB/s ; theoretical peak : 40MB/s . Built-in on all Modular Macs except the LC series , C610 , and Performa 400 . The SE/30 could be adapted to use this and there was even a Mac Plus SCSI NuBus . Supports every possible expansion from CPU to Ethernet to DMA . NuBus 90 : NuBus Mac II back compatable . 20MHz bus clock , avg throughput : ~30MB/s ; burst mode : 80MB/s . Future card designs will be 7 '' instead of the old 12 '' . QuickRing : A peer-to-peer bus used in parallel with NuBus 90 . Apple 's VLBus - `` Architecture is identical to that of VLBus '' ( Byte 10/92:128 ) . Burst mode : 350MB/s ( Byte 10/92:128 ) . In development . CPU expansion : handled either through the PDS or the NuBus . Unlike PDS , Nubus CPU cards { example-Radius Rocket } allow use of multiple processors at the same time . This is like having two or more Macs in the same box able to dual task or joinly process depending on the card or software involved { Each NuBus card needs its own memory but most NuBus cards of this type come with 8MB RAM SIMMs on the card standard } . IBM Memory expansion : parity SIMMs , non-parity SIMMs { some newer models do a Mac- like SIMM memory check } , or a dozen or so different types of memory boards . HD Interfaces { limited to hard drives by design or lack of development } : MFM : Modified Frequency Modulation , RLL : Run Length Limited only used with smaller [ ² 60mb ] hard drives . IDE : Integrated Device Electronics Asynchronous { ~5MB/s max } and synchronous { 8.3MB/s max } transfer . currently the most common standard , and is mainly used for medium sized drives . Can have more than one hard drive . ESDI : Enhanced Small Device Interface ~1.25MB/s throughput . generally considered better interface than SCSI-1 in many ways but not common enough for practical consideration . Outside of hard drives , device choices are very limited compared to SCSI-1 . BUS interfaces { New 'plug and play ' ISA and EISA compatable cards may have problems working with old cards ( InfoWorld ; PC Week 03/08/93 ; Vaporware 4/93 ) . } ISA 8 & 16-bit interfaces common . Has 24-bit data path limit { which produces a 16MB limit for which there are software workarounds } ( PC Mag 4/27/93:105 ) . 1.5 MB/s ( Byte 3/93:132 ) . Uses edge-triggered interrupts , ca n't share them , hence comes the IRQ conflict . Limited busmastering capabilities , some cards are n't bandwidth limited { COM ports , LPT ports , game ports , MIDI card , etc . } while others are { video and disk controllers } . Dominant factor , but it's showing its age . Most ISA motherboard designs are 16-bit ( PC World Feb 1993 : 144-5 ) } . MCA { Micro Channel } IBM 's 16 and 32-bit bus ; `` allows use of more than one CPU in a computer '' ( DCT ) and anything can talk to anything , as fast as the two components involved can handle it . Never took off because it was incompatible with ISA and EISA . Planned to be bus interface of IBM PowerPC 601 ( Carl Jabido ) . EISA { NuBus Mac II is closest Mac equivalent } 32-bit , 8.33 MHz , burst mode : 33MB/s . It also has the ability to self-configure cards like MCA and allows multiple bus masters , sharable interrupt and DMA channels and multiple CPU use . VESA Local Bus : VLB { Sometimes mistakenly refereed to as PDS } Local Bus standard . Runs at CPU clock rate , Burst modes : ~130 MB/s { 32-bit } 250 MB/s { 64-bit } ( Byte 10/92:128 ) . Limited to three slots but allows bus mastering and will coexist with either ISA or EISA . Consitered ideal for video and disk I/O . DELL has filled a claim that this violates one of their patents ( Mel Martinez ) . QuickRing : Apple 's faster { 350 MB/s burst } version of VLB architecture ( Byte 10/92:132 ) . Might show up in some IBM and PowerPC machines ( Byte 10/92:132-133 ) . In development . PCI Intel 's version of Local Bus that is intended to totally replace ISA/EISA/MCA . In development . OSes { assumes full installation [ print drivers , fonts , Multifinder , etc . ] and multiple application use . } Mac 512K to 1MB of OS and hardware commands have been put into ROM . This allows Apple to control its machine by putting key hooks for the Mac OS { QuickDraw , menu commands , print , mouse , SCSI & sound drivers , etc } in ROM , which require clone makers to use the ROM chip or read ROM on to disks { Which requires access to the proper Mac since different Macs have slightly different ROM chips ; Plus vs Classic for example . } With key hooks for the OS support interface in ROM , programers do not have to worry as much whether the disk OS has the necessary hardware commands or that those commands are consitant and therefore can write smaller programs . This also allows Apple greater control over hardware-software standards and that the disk OS can be smaller and , with some of the tookbox command code in ROM , with lower RAM requirements then a totally disk based OS . Macs use Masked ROM which is as fast as DRAM ( Jon Wtte ) . 6.0.7 : Single program usage base requirements : 1 MB and DD floppy , cooperatively-multitasking base requirements : 2MB and HD floppy . Features a GUI , cooperative-multitasker [ MultiFinder ] , standard program interface , & standard stereo sound support [ snd ] . Network receiving part of AppleShare software is bundled with the OS . Has a 8MB RAM barrier and is a 24-bit OS . Some third party products allow 14MB of Virtual Memory as long as real RAM is below 8MB . 6.0.8 : 6.0.7 with 7.0.0 print drivers . 6.0.8L : System 6 for some Macs that require System 7.0.X . 7.0.X : Base requirements : 2MB , 40MB Hard Drive , and 68000 ; De-facto standard to run all features well : 4MB , 80MB Hard Drive , and 68030 { lowest present non-portable Mac configuration } . Using up to 10.08MB { This is EVERYTHING on system disks } of hard disk space this has 6.0.7 features plus program linking within and between computers [ IAC ] , built-in server capabilities { Filesharing can be used by older OSes using AppleShare Client software and can be accessed by 10 macs max ; 4-5 is more speed practical , IAC requires 7.X } , Virtual Memory in machines with MMU { 1.6 times real RAM for least noticeable IIsi speed degradation } , drag and drop , QuickTime & built-in TrueType support . Supports sound input [ AIFF and snd formats ] for most present machines . Can access up to 1GB of true RAM and 4GB of virtual memory and is both a 24 and 32-bit OS . To use real RAM beyond 8MB it must be in 32-bit mode and on older machines requires the 'Mode 32 ' extension . Apple 's last 'free ' OS . 7.1.0 : 7.0.1 with WorldScript support , speedier , and less RAM usage than 7.0.dot ( MacWeek 8/24/92 ; 9/14/92 ; PC Week 9/7/92 ) . To run in 32-bit mode on older machines it requires the 'Mode 32 ' or '32-Bit Enabler ' extension . Marks the start of Apple saling its Mac OS instead of allowing free upgrades { Bundled with new machines , $ 49 for 7.0.X upgrades , $ 99 otherwise } . [ The installer has a bug that when upgrading it may keep some old system fonts from the previous system inside the system file . This can eat up any RAM benefits and cause other problems . Apple itself recommends removing all fonts from the system file . ] A/UX 3.0 [ UNIX ] : Needs 8MB RAM { 12-20MB suggested } , 160MB hard drive , and a 68030 or 68040 equivalent to run . This 32-bit preemptive multitasking OS is large due to being UNIX and needing translators between it and the Mac ROMs . Price : $ 709 . Note : sound output was supported in OSes 3.2 to 6.0.5 by many formats including the following : snd , WAVE , ASND , FSSD , QSSN , SMSD , SOUN , dc2d , and DCFL . In 6.0.7 the sound manager was optimized for the sound standards 'snd ' and AIFF which causes some playback problems for the old formats , though most still play . IBM Machiness have little GUI code , data , and hooks present in hardware for programmers to work with , so most of the coding must be provided in the OS . Since hard disks were slow the disk OS code is read into RAM . In addition , what little ROM code there is also read into RAM { a process called Shadow ROM } This results in faster implementation since RAM is faster then PROMS or EPROMS . Having most of the OS code on disk has the advantage of being able to better optimize the code given a certain piece or collection of hardware which is harder with a ROM based system due to the 'patches ' needed . In addition it reduces the need for and size of patches if a major revision of the hardware support is needed . Side note : The FTC charged that MicroSoft formed a OS trust by not providing all feature documentation for its OSes to developers outside MS and designing its Windows and DOS apps to fail under OS/2 ( `` Undocumented Windows '' ) and '' There is deliberate code in [ Windows ] NT Beta which causes the install to abort if OS/2 Boot Manager is present '' ( Gregory Hicks , Info-IBMPC Digest V92 # 201 ) . Due to a conflict of intrest by one member the vote of the FTC judicial council for action against Microsoft was a tie which resulted in no action . Rumors-the FTC will presue the matter , likely to the point of choosing a new member or whole new council . In addition the government has turned down Microsoft 's copyright of `` Windows '' which would allow it to charge a fee for developers using their hooks ( PC Week 03/08/93 ) . MicroSoft OSes DOS 5.0 : Has a 640K barrier with its own memory manager , a 1 MB barrier with third party memory managers . This 16-bit OS requires that each program must provide its own print drivers and be 16-bit { Programs need to be DOS Protected Mode Interface ( DPMI ) compliant and running on a 386dx [ 32-bit Protected Mode ] to break these barriers } . Contains the GUI shell present in DOS 4.0 . DOS 6.0 : DOS 5.0 with the added features of a built-in file compresion , disk defragmenter , debugger for the CONFIG.SYS file . It needs a $ 80 module for networking { Cost : $ 50 through 5/93 , after that $ 129.99 } ( Byte April 1993:44-46 ) . DOS 7.0 : 32-bit DOS . In development ( PC Week 04/05/93 ) . Window 3.0 : Runs on top of DOS . Breaks 640K and 1M barriers but still has to deal with DOS file structure . Base requirements : 1MB , floppy and 286 ; to run well 2MB , hard drive , 386sx and fast display adapter { > 8-bit } . Has the equivalent of Mac 's QD called Windows GDI [ Graphics Device Interface ] . This does not have a consistent application interface { Like early Mac programs ( 1984-1985 ) } nor a very large program base { compared to DOS } and still tends to slow the machine down ( Info-IBMPC Digest V92 # 186 ) with speed is more dependent on the display adapter then on the CPU ( Bill Coleman ) . Window programs tend to be disk and memory hogs compared to their DOS counterparts ( Byte April 1993:98-108 ) . Window 3.1 : A faster version of Window 3.0 with better memory managment . Base requirements 1 MB , hard drive and a 286 ; to run well 2MB , hard drive , 386sx . Apple plans to release its print drivers for this ( PC Week 12/28/92 ) . Windows for Workgroups : To run well : 4MB RAM and 386dx ( PC World Feb/93:160 ) . Intermediary between Win 3.1 and Windows NT . It is basically Windows 3.1 with built-in peer to peer networking support . Windows NT : Beta release takes about 50MB of disk space [ including the swap file ] , and 12MB RAM { Betas are notorious for RAM usage especially in the interaction between debuging code and program compliers , hence the reports of 24MB requirements } . Released version supposed to need 8MB RAM but , Gates himself now recommends 16MB RAM ( PC Week 04/15/92 ) . This 32-bit OS has Protected mode multitasking , multithreading , symmetric multiprocessing , a recoverable file system , and 32-bit GDI . Has built in networking that is OSF DCE compliant and can handle up to 4GB of RAM . Even though some people see a July 4 release date ( InfoWorld Nov 16/92 ) , rumor is that the final version will not be available before Oct 1993 ( InfoWorld May 25/92 ; July 6/92 ; Vaporware 07/92 ; 08/92 ) or 4th quarter 1993 ( PC Week 09/28/92 ) . Windows upgrades will be $ 295 , otherwise $ 495 ( PC Week 04/15/92 ; 03/15/93 ) . Other OSes PC-DOS 6.0 : IBM 's version of DOS 6.0 . It runs Windows much faster then DOS 6.0 due to faster file I/O and video handling ( InfoWorld Feb 1 , 93 ) . DR DOS 6.0 : same as DOS 5.0 with some extras { like built-in data compression } and memory management enhancements . Still has 640K/1MB barrier . A later version { Novell DOS } of this may use a version of the Mac finder and Apple file management system ( PC Week 12/14/92 ; InfoWorld Dec 14/92 ) . OS/2 2.0 : Unix like features and unix like requirements ; 8-16MB RAM , 60MB { uses 17-33MB } hard drive , and 386dx CPU . This 32-bit multithreaded , multitasking OS can address up to 4GB of RAM but has to use a fast swap file to use more than 16 MB RAM on ISA systems using DMA { Direct Memory Access } . IBM plans to use Taligent 's OOPS in future versions of this ( InfoWorld Oct 26/92 ) . AIX : IBM 's UNIX system , planned to be a subset of PowerOpen and Taligent OS . NeXTStep : GUI UNIX to provide NeXT features on IBM machines . Beta out , final version to be out by May 25 , 1993 . Solaris OS for x86 : a SunSoft port . A 32-bit OS with symmetric multiprocessing and multithreading , built-in networking capabilities with tools to allow remote configuring and adminstration features , and communication package . Client : $ 795 , 50 users server : $ 1,995 , 1000s users server : $ 5,995 . Developer kits-software : $ 495 , hardware : $ 195 . Mac 7.1 [ working name : Star Trek ] : Apple had System 7.0 running off Intel Chips and is looking at making a 7.1 version available for IBM ( ComputerWorld Nov 2/92 ; MacWeek 03/22/93 ) . At present this is planned to run on top of Novell 's DR DOS , require a 486 or equivalent to run and that apps will need to be recompiled ( MacWeek 03/22/93 ) . Viewed as Novell 's answer to Windows NT . The complexity of PC hardware set ups is one reason for slow progress { This seems to Apple/IBM 's way of leading to the PowerPC line out in late 1993/early 1994 and Pink OS in late 1994-early 1995 . } PowerPC Rumor-IBM will build its PowerPC 601 by late 1993 ( InfoWorld June 8 & 15 , 92 ; MacWeek 7/13/92 ; PC Week 3/15/93 ) . It will have MicroChannel bus and XGA video ( Carl B Jabido ) , and will run native version AIX and Mac apps ( PC Week 3/15/93 ) ; there have been no comments on compatablity of DOS or Windows apps . Apple 's PowerPC 601 machine { Tesseract } is planned to be out Jan 24 , 1994 and to have MC98601/50 MHz , 4/8MB RAM , a 2.8-Mbyte floppy drive and expected to sale near LC line prices { ~ $ 2000 , down from projections of ~ $ 3000 ( MacUser 9/92:146 ) } ( MacWeek 3/22/93 ) . PowerOpen [ A/UX 4.0 ] : A 32-bit preemtive multitasking OS planned to run on PowerPCs and 68030/40 Macs ( MacWeek 7/13/92 ) . Intel compatibility uncertain ( See Mac 7.1 above ) . Planned base requirements : 68030 , 8MB RAM , 80MB hard drive ( MacWeek 4/19/93 ) . Rumor-ahead of schedule ; COULD be out by mid 1993 . Rumor-this could be the OS for IBM 's PowerPC 601 which is due by late 1993 . Pink [ Taligent OS ] : Expecting delivery in 1994 ( Wall Street Journal 1/12/92 ) and may have some parts shipping in OS/2 and AIX in 1993 and Mac OS and PowerOpen with the PowerPCs ( MacWeek 01/25/93 ) . Windows NT : Possible port ( MacWeek 04/05/93 ) . See IBM OS section for details . Solaris OS : Version of this Sun Microsystems Inc UNIX OS to run on the Power PCs in 1994 ( MacWeek 04/05/93 ) . One of the few OSes to directly state that it will run Windows/DOS programs . IBM OS section for details NeXTStep : possible port see IBM OS section for details . OS Number Crunching ( Mel Park ) Mac Arithmetic is done in a consistent numerical environment { SANE or Standard Apple Numerics Environment } . Floating point numbers are 96 bits long when an FPU is present and 80 bits otherwise . Exceptions , such as dividing by zero or taking the square root of a negative number , do not cause an abort but are handled in a logically consistent manner . 1/0 produces the internal representation for infinity ( INF ) . 1/ ( 1/0 ) produces zero . The above treatment of 1/ ( 1/0 ) occurs in an FPU-equipped machine even when SANE is bypassed and the FPU programmed directly . IBM Floating point numbers are 80-bits with a hardware FPU , 64-bits when emulated . The way they are handled is dependent on the coding of whatever compiler or assembler was used for a program . On older DOS complilers exceptions could cause program aborts ; 1/0 and 1/ ( 1/0 ) would abort to the DOS prompt at the point where they occured . Most present compilers handle this better . Result : there is little consistent handling of numbers between DOS , Windows and OS/2 programs nor between programs for just one OS . Networking [ Includes printing ] WYSIWYG printing can be a problem with either Mac of IBM machines especially if one sends TrueType fonts to a older style PostScript printer . Mac Hardware : Built-in LocalTalk network port and a built-in printer port . LocalTalk has moderate speeds ( 230.4 Kb/s ) requires special connectors for each machine ( $ 15 and up ) and can be run off of either the printer port { to include very old macs } or the network port { standard today } . Built-in Ethernet is becoming common but many older Macs require a PDS or Nubus card at about $ 150- $ 300 for each machine . These cards provide three connectors and transceivers { thick , thin , and 10BaseT } for Ethernet . The Macintosh Quadra family and some Centris models includes Ethernet interface on motherboard , with transceivers available . TokenRing has been a network option since 1989 . Software : AppleTalk { the suite of protocols } standard with Mac OS , which can use variety of media types . AppleShare client software included with the OS as well and can connect to file servers such as Novell Netware , 3Com 3+Open , Banyan Vines , DEC Pathworks , Apple 's AppleShare servers , System 7 File Sharing machines , and AFP servers running on variety of UNIX hosts . MacTCP allows typical TCP/IP communications ( telnet , ftp , NFS , rlogin ) . A later version will have Unix X/Open Transport Interface ( XTI ) built-in by the end of 1993 ( MacWeek 04/12/93 ) . Third-party software to connect to NFS servers . DEC Pathworks provides DECnet support . Peer-to-peer file sharing software built-in to System 7.1 ( See OS section ) . Full server software is extra . Printing requires connection of the printer and the printer being selected in the chooser . Changing printers is by selecting a different name in the chooser . The same is true of connecting to servers . Printing bugs : Monaco TrueType font is different then the screen bitmap font . { QuickDraw QX is suppossed to fix this and similar problems . } IBM Hardware : LocalTalk [ not widely used ] , Ethernet , and TokenRing . Software : Novell Netware , Banyan Vines , DECNet , Windows/Work Groups , AppleTalk protocols , and AppleShare { subset of AppleTalk } . Each of the MS-DOS networking schemes are , in general , totally incompatible with the others . Once you have chosen one , you are pretty much locked-in to that product line from then on . Windows/Work Groups is a little more forgiving and removes some of this problem . Novell Netware is the biggest , { ~80 percent of the corporate market . } and in general is more powerful and offers better control/management/security than AppleShare , but it 's also more complex to set up and manage . This will change due to the use of the Mac finder and file management system by Novell . ( PC Week 12/14/92 & 12/28/92 ; InfoWorld Dec 14/92 ; MacWeek 3/22/93 ) Printing { Very OS dependent } DOS : If it 's a single user , then you plug the printer into the parallel port , and do n't worry about it { Tweeking may be needed with poorly written software } . Network Printing is not controlled by the system , but is mostly implemented by the actual program , therefore performance varies from one software program to the next . Windows 3.x : supports standard drivers and can do a good job of showing `` jobs '' in the print queue , but it always lists printers as `` active '' ... even if they are not . This becomes a problem if there are several incompatible printers on the same net , because there 's no way for software to reliably determine which printer is active right now . Windows for Workgroups is more Mac-like and intelligent about this . OS/2 : Mac-like ; the os deals with printers , with apps making calls to the OS . Printing bugs : due to poor programing some programs for all the above OSes do not have WYSIWYG printing . This is the fault of the programs in question and not that of the OS involved . Price issue : This is very dynamic with Mac providing more build-in features than IBM and IBM being more 'get only what you need ' then Mac and price wars by both worlds . The IBM machines ' modualar nature prevents any kind of true hardware standarization , which in turn requires OSes and programs to be very complex to handle ALL the variation in hardware . When one adds all the standard Mac hardware features to an IBM { built-in input/output sound support , SCSI , PDS , built-in monitor support , built-in networking , standard mouse interface , and NuBus 90 in higher machines } the Mac tends to be cheaper then an equivalent equipted IBM machine { Especially since some IBM monitors can be used with Macs which cuts some more of the Mac 's cost ( MacUser Aug 1992:158-176 ) } . Some prices using some of the info in this sheet and MacUser April 1993 . All Macs below come with a PDS slot , VRAM , and SCSI-1 built in . Except where noted , monitor is extra and a built-in monitor interface is provided { no card needed except for 24-bit color display } . IBM planned a $ 1,200 386SLC/25MHz model with a 60MB hard drive and color VGA monitor { ~VRAM } ( MacWeek 8/17/92 ) { sounds like a Color Classic without SCSI-1 , sound support , built-in network support , FPU socket , built-in expansion to 16-bit color , etc } . Color Classic : $ 1,389 - 030/16MHz with 16-bit data bus { ~386sx/20MHz equivalent } , 4/80 , FPU socket , and built-in monitor . LCIII : $ 1,499 - 030/25MHz { ~386dx/33MHz equivalent } , and 4/160 . Centris 610 : $ 2,899 - 68LC040/20MHz { Depending on the program ~486sx/40 or ~'486dx2sx'/20 [ 40 ] MHz equivalent } , 8/230 , built-in ethernet , 300i CD-ROM , a PDS/NuBus 90 slot and VRAM for 16-bit color . Centris 650 : 040/25MHz { Depending on the program ~486dx/50 MHz or 486dx2/50 MHz equivalent } with a PDS and 3 NuBus 90 slots . $ 3,189 { ethernet , 8/80 } ; $ 3,559 { ethernet , 8/230 } ; $ 3,999 { ethernet , 8/230 , CD-ROM , VRAM for 16-bit color } Bibliography notes 'Vaporware ' is available in the digest/vapor directory by FTP on sumex- aim.stanford.edu [ 36.44.0.6 ] and was by Murphy Sewall { last issue : April 93 . } 'Info-IBMPC Digest ' back issues are available from wsmr-simtel20.army.mil in directory PD2 : < ARCHIVES.IBMPC > 'Dictionary of Computer Terms 3rd ed .

Well , I could use the argument that some here use about `` nature '' and claim that you can not have superhuman powers because you are a human ; superhuman powers are beyond what a human has , and since you are a human , any powers you have are not beyond those of a human . Hence , you can not have superhuman powers . Sound good to you ? Anyway , to the evidence question : it depends on the context . In this group , since you are posting from a american college site , I 'm willing to take it as given that you have a pair of blue jeans . And , assuming there is some coherency in your position , I will take it as a given that you do not have superhuman powers . Arguments are evidence in themselves , in some respects . > When you say the `` existence of [ sic ] Jesus '' , I assume that you > mean just the man , without any special powers , etc .

I have no reason to believe that there was n't ever a man . Good . > However , most of the claims ARE extradinary : eg virgin birth > [ virgin in the sense of not having any sexual intercourse ] , resurection , > Son of God , etc . THOSE claims require extra evidence . `` Extra '' evidence ? Why do n't we start with evidence at all ? I can not see any evidence for the V. B. which the cynics in this group would ever accept . As for the second , it is the foundation of the religion . Anyone who claims to have seen the risen Jesus ( back in the 40 day period ) is a believer , and therefore is discounted by those in this group ; since these are all ancients anyway , one again to choose to dismiss the whole thing . The third is as much a metaphysical relationship as anything else -- even those who agree to it have argued at length over what it *means* , so again I do n't see how evidence is possible . I thus interpret the `` extraordinary claims '' claim as a statement that the speaker will not accept *any* evidence on the matter . -- C.

The athiest 's position is that there is no PROOF of the existence of God . As much as some people accept their Church , their priests or straight from their own scriptures as the `` proof '' , this does not satisfy atheists . Atheists DO believe in recognisable authorities . If they were as dogmatic as you claim they are , they would be trying to prove 1 + 1 =2 every time they got up . What they dispute is that Churches , priests , scriptures etc . represent true authorities and know the TRUTH . > To demand scintific or rational proof of God 's existence , is to deny > God 's existence , since neither science , nor reason , can , in their very > nature , prove anything . Are you asking us to believe blindly ? You are trying to deny that part of us that makes us ask the question `` Does God exist ? '' i.e . self-awareness and reason . If we do not use our ability to reason we become as ignorant as the other animals on this earth . Does God want us to be like that ? You are right that science and reason can not PROVE anything . However , if we do not use them we can only then believe on FAITH alone . And since we can only use faith , why is one picture of `` God '' ( e.g . Hinduism ) any less valid than another ( e.g . Christianity ) ? > ============================================================================== > Mark Baker | `` The task ... is not to cut down jungles , but > aa888 @ Freenet.carleton.ca | to irrigate deserts .

The engines range from D all the way to M in common manufacture , N and O I 've heard of used at special occasions .

Purchase of engines like I have been describing require membership in the National Association of Rocketry , the Tripoli Rocketry Assoc. , or you have to be part of an educational institute or company involved in rocketry . Amatuer rocketry is another area . I 'm not really familiar with this , but it is an area where metal parts are allowed , along with liquid fuels and what not . I do n't know what kind of regulations are involved , but I 'm sure they are numerous . High power rocketry is very exciting !

A product cipher is a block cipher that iterates several weak operations such as substitution , transposition , modular addition/multiplication , and linear transformation . ( A `` block cipher '' just means a cipher that encrypts a block of data -- -8 bytes , say -- -all at once , then goes on to the next block . ) The notion of product ciphers is due to Shannon [ SHA49 ] . Examples of modern product ciphers include LUCIFER [ SOR84 ] , DES [ NBS77 ] , SP-networks [ KAM78 ] , LOKI [ BRO90 ] , FEAL [ SHI84 ] , PES [ LAI90 ] , Khufu and Khafre [ ME91a ] . The so-called Feistel ciphers are a class of product ciphers which operate on one half of the ciphertext at each round , and then swap the ciphertext halves after each round . LUCIFER , DES , LOKI , and FEAL are examples of Feistel ciphers . The following table compares the main parameters of several product ciphers : cipher | block length | key bits | number of rounds LUCIFER 128 128 16 DES 64 56 16 LOKI 64 64 16 FEAL 64 128 2^x , x > = 5 PES 64 128 8 * What makes a product cipher secure ? Nobody knows how to prove mathematically that a product cipher is completely secure . So in practice one begins by demonstrating that the cipher `` looks highly random '' . For example , the cipher must be nonlinear , and it must produce ciphertext which functionally depends on every bit of the plaintext and the key . Meyer [ MEY78 ] has shown that at least 5 rounds of DES are required to guarantee such a dependence . In this sense a product cipher should act as a `` mixing '' function which combines the plaintext , key , and ciphertext in a complex nonlinear fashion . The fixed per-round substitutions of the product cipher are referred to as S-boxes . For example , LUCIFER has 2 S-boxes , and DES has 8 S-boxes . The nonlinearity of a product cipher reduces to a careful design of these S-boxes . A list of partial design criteria for the S-boxes of DES , which apply to S-boxes in general , may be found in Brown [ BRO89 ] and Brickell et al . [ BRI86 ] . * What are some group-theoretic properties of product ciphers ? Let E be a product cipher that maps N-bit blocks to N-bit blocks . Let E_K ( X ) be the encryption of X under key K. Then , for any fixed K , the map sending X to E_K ( X ) is a permutation of the set of N-bit blocks . Denote this permutation by P_K . The set of all N-bit permutations is called the symmetric group and is written S_ { 2^N } . The collection of all these permutations P_K , where K ranges over all possible keys , is denoted E ( S_ { 2^N } ) . If E were a random mapping from plaintexts to ciphertexts then we would expect E ( S_ { 2^N } ) to generate a large subset of S_ { 2^N } . Coppersmith and Grossman [ COP74 ] have shown that a very simple product cipher can generate the alternating group A_ { 2^N } given a sufficient number of rounds . ( The alternating group is half of the symmetric group : it consists of all `` even '' permutations , i.e. , all permutations which can be written as an even number of swaps . ) Even and Goldreich [ EVE83 ] were able to extend these results to show that Feistel ciphers can generate A_ { 2^N } , given a sufficient number of rounds . The security of multiple encipherment also depends on the group-theoretic properties of a cipher . Multiple encipherment is an extension over single encipherment if for keys K1 , K2 there does not exist a third key K3 such that E_K2 ( E_K1 ( X ) ) == E_ ( K3 ) ( X ) ( ** ) which indicates that encrypting twice with two independent keys K1 , K2 is equal to a single encryption under the third key K3 . If for every K1 , K2 there exists a K3 such that eq . ( ** ) is true then we say that E is a group . This question of whether DES is a group under this definition was extensively studied by Sherman , Kaliski , and Rivest [ SHE88 ] . In their paper they give strong evidence for the hypothesis that DES is not a group . In fact DES is not a group [ CAM93 ] . * What can be proven about the security of a product cipher ? Recall from above that P_K is a permutation produced by E under some key K. The goal of the designer of E is to ensure that P_K appears to be a random element of S_ { 2^N } , the symmetric group . Let R be an element of S_ { 2^N } selected randomly . We will say that P_K and R are indistinguishable if an observer given P_K and R in some order can not distinguish between these two permutations in polynomial time . That is , with time bounded resources , the observer can not determine which of the permutations is produced by E : the optimal decision is no better than simply guessing . Luby and Rackoff [ LUB88 ] have shown that a class of Feistel ciphers are secure in this sense when the round mapping is replaced by random boolean functions . * How are block ciphers used to encrypt data longer than the block size ? There are four standard `` modes of operation '' ( and numerous non-standard ones as well ) . The standard modes of operation are defined in the U.S. Department of Commerce Federal Information Processing Standard ( FIPS ) 81 , published in 1980 . See the question about `` ECB '' below for more details . Although they are defined for the DES block cipher , the `` modes of operation '' can be used with any block cipher . * Can symmetric block ciphers be used for message authentication ? One may use a symmetric cryptosystem block cipher to prove to himself that he did or did not generate a message , and to prove to himself whether his message was altered or unaltered since generation . But one can not prove these things to another without revealing the key , and thereafter that key can not be used to prove anything about any messages that were authenticated using that key . See ANSI X3.106-1983 and FIPS 113 ( 1985 ) for a standard method of message authentication using DES . * What exactly is DES ? DES is the U.S. Government 's Data Encryption Standard - a product cipher that operates on 64-bit blocks of data , using a 56-bit key . It is defined in FIPS 46-1 ( 1988 ) [ which supersedes FIPS 46 ( 1977 ) ] . FIPS are Federal Information Processing Standards published by NTIS . DES is identical to the ANSI standard Data Encryption Algorithm ( DEA ) defined in ANSI X3.92-1981 . * What is triple DES ? Triple DES is a product cipher which , like DES , operates on 64-bit data blocks . There are several forms , each of which uses the DES cipher 3 times . Some forms use two 56-bit keys , some use three . The `` DES modes of operation '' may also be used with triple-DES . Some people refer to E ( K1 , D ( K2 , E ( K1 , x ) ) ) as triple-DES . This method is defined in chapter 7.2 of the ANSI standard X9.17-1985 `` Financial Institution Key Management '' and is intended for use in encrypting DES keys and IVs for `` Automated Key Distribution '' . Its formal name is `` Encryption and Decryption of a Single Key by a Key Pair '' , but it is referenced in other standards documents as EDE . That standard says ( section 7.2.1 ) : `` Key encrypting keys may be a single DEA key or a DEA key pair . Key pairs shoud be used where additional security is needed ( e.g. , the data protected by the key ( s ) has a long security life ) . A key pair shall not be encrypted or decrypted using a single key . '' Others use the term `` triple-DES '' for E ( K1 , D ( K2 , E ( K3 , x ) ) ) or E ( K1 , E ( K2 , E ( K3 , x ) ) ) . One of us ( Carl Ellison ) keeps advocating DES triple use in the form E ( K1 , TRAN ( E ( K2 , TRAN ( E ( K3 , COMPRESS ( x ) ) ) ) ) ) , where each DES instance has its own key and IV ( for CBC mode ) and TRAN has been posted on sci.crypt . ( It is a large-block transposition program taking its key from the data stream itself , so that it is not an encryption program on its own part . ) * What is differential cryptanalysis ? Differential cryptanalysis is a statistical attack that can be applied to any iterated mapping ( ie . any mapping which is based on a repeated round function ) . The method was recently popularized by Biham and Shamir [ BIH91 ] , but Coppersmith has remarked that the S-boxes of DES were optimized against this attack some 20 years ago . This method has proved effective against several product ciphers , notably FEAL [ BI91a ] . Differential cryptanalysis is based on observing a large number of ciphertexts Y , Y ' whose corresponding plaintexts X , X ' satisfy a known difference D = X+X ' , where + is componentwise XOR . In the basic Biham-Shamir attack , 2^ { 47 } such plaintext pairs are required to determine the key for DES . Substantially fewer pairs are required if DES is truncated to 6 or 8 rounds . In these cases , the actual key can be recovered in a matter of minutes using a few thousand pairs . For full DES this attack is impractical because it requires so many known plaintexts . The work of Biham and Shamir on DES revealed several startling observations on the algorithm . Most importantly , if the key schedule was removed from DES and a 16*48 = 768-bit key was used , the key could be recovered in less than 2^ { 64 } steps . Thus independent subkeys do not add substantial security to DES . Further , the S-boxes of DES are extremely sensitive in that changing even single entries in these tables yields significant improvement in the differential attack . Adi Shamir is quoted to say ( NYTimes Oct 13 1991 ) , `` I would say that , contrary to what some people believe , there is no evidence of tampering with the DES so that the basic design was weakened . '' * How was NSA involved in the design of DES ? According to Kinnucan [ KIN78 ] , Tuchman , a member of the group that developed DES at IBM is quoted as saying , `` We developed the DES algorithm entirely within IBM using IBMers . The NSA did not dictate a single wire ! '' Tuchman and Meyer ( another developer of DES ) spent a year breaking ciphers and finding weaknesses in Lucifer . They then spent two years strengthening Lucifer . `` Their basic approach was to look for strong substitution , permutation , and key scheduling functions ... IBM has classified the notes containing the selection criteria at the request of the NSA ... . ` The NSA told us we had inadvertently reinvented some of the deep secrets it uses to make its own algorithms , ' explains Tuchman . '' On the other hand , a document called `` Involvement of the NSA in the development of DES : unclassified summary of the United States Select Committee on Intelligence '' , printed in the IEEE Communications Magazine , p53-55 , 1978 , states : `` In the development of DES , NSA convinced IBM that a reduced keysize was sufficient ; indirectly assisted in the development of the S-box structures ; and certified that the final DES algorithm was , to the best of their knowledge , free from any statistical or mathematical weakness . '' Clearly the key size was reduced at the insistence of the NSA . The article further states that the NSA did not tamper with the algorithm itself , just the parameters , which in some sense resolves the apparent conflict in the remarks of Meyer and Tuchman presented above . * Is DES available in software ? Several people have made DES code available via ftp ( see part 10 for pathnames ) : Stig Ostholm [ FTPSO ] ; BSD [ FTPBK ] ; Eric Young [ FTPEY ] ; Dennis Furguson [ FTPDF ] ; Mark Riordan [ FTPMR ] ; Phil Karn [ FTPPK ] . A Pascal listing of DES is also given in Patterson [ PAT87 ] . FIPS 46-1 says `` The algorithm specified in this standard is to be implemented ... using hardware ( not software ) technology . ... Software implementations in general purpose computers are not in compliance with this standard . '' Despite this , software implementations abound , and are used by government agencies . * Is DES available in hardware ? The following paragraphs are quoted from messages sent to the editors . We do n't vouch for the quality or even existence of the products . Chip Rosenthal says : `` Dallas Semiconductor makes a DES encryption/decryption device for use on standard , digital 64Kbps PCM telecom data streams . It is capable of processing data in real time , e.g . one sample/frame . It is the DS2160 . Their phone number is 214-450-0400 . You would probably need to talk with Dewight in Telecom marketing . '' Christian Franke , franke @ informatik.rwth-aachen.de , says : `` 1 . Cryptech CRY12C102 : 22.5Mbit/s according to Data Sheet , with 32 Bit interface . We use this one , because it was the only one available when we started the project . No problems ! 2 . Pijnenburg PCC100 : 20Mbit/s according to Data Sheet .

They can be reached at ( 613 ) 820-0024 . * Can DES be used to protect classified information ? DES is not intended to protect classified data . FIPS 46-1 says : `` This standard will be used by Federal departments and agencies for the cryptographic protection of computer data when the following conditions apply : 1 . ... cryptographic protection is required ; and 2. the data is not classified according to the National Security Act of 1947 , as amended , or the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 , as amended . '' * What are `` ECB '' , `` CBC '' , `` CFB '' , and `` OFB '' encryption ? These are methods for using block ciphers , such as DES , to encrypt messages , files , and blocks of data , known as `` modes of operation . '' Four `` modes of operation '' are defined in FIPS 81 ( 1980 December 2 ) , and also in ANSI X3.106-1983 . FIPS 81 specifies that when 7-bit ASCII data is sent in octets , the unused most-significant bit is to be set to 1 . FIPS 81 also specifies the padding for short blocks . The four DES modes of operation are : Electronic Code Book ( ECB ) , Cipher Block Chaining ( CBC ) , K-bit Cipher FeedBack ( CFB ) , and K-bit Output FeedBack ( OFB ) . These methods are explained below in a c-language-like notation . Some symbols : P [ n ] The n'th block of plaintext , input to encryption , output from decryption . Size of block determined by the mode . C [ n ] The n'th block of ciphertext , output from encryption , input to decryption . Size of block determined by the mode . E ( m ) The DES encryption function , performed on 64-bit block m , using the 16-key schedule derived from some 56-bit key . D ( m ) The DES decryption function , performed on 64-bit block m , using the same key schedule as in E ( m ) , except that the 16 keys in the schedule are used in the opposite order as in E ( m ) . IV A 64-bit `` initialization vector '' , a secret value which , along with the key , is shared by both encryptor and decryptor . I [ n ] The n'th value of a 64-bit variable , used in some modes . R [ n ] The n'th value of a 64-bit variable , used in some modes . LSB ( m , k ) The k least significant ( right-most ) bits of m. e.g . m & ( ( 1 < < k ) - 1 ) MSB ( m , k ) The k most significant ( left-most ) bits of m. e.g . ( m > > ( 64-k ) ) & ( ( 1 < < k ) - 1 ) = ^ < < > > & operators as defined in the c langage . Electronic Code Book ( ECB ) : P [ n ] and C [ n ] are each 64-bits long . Encryption : Decryption : C [ n ] = E ( P [ n ] ) P [ n ] = D ( C [ n ] ) Cipher Block Chaining ( CBC ) : P [ n ] and C [ n ] are each 64-bits long . Encryption : Decryption : C [ 0 ] = E ( P [ 0 ] ^IV ) P [ 0 ] = D ( C [ 0 ] ) ^IV ( n > 0 ) C [ n ] = E ( P [ n ] ^C [ n-1 ] ) P [ n ] = D ( C [ n ] ) ^C [ n-1 ] k-bit Cipher FeedBack ( CFB ) : P [ n ] and C [ n ] are each k bits long , 1 < = k < = 64 . Encryption : Decryption : I [ 0 ] = IV I [ 0 ] = IV ( n > 0 ) I [ n ] = I [ n-1 ] < < k | C [ n-1 ] I [ n ] = I [ n-1 ] < < k | C [ n-1 ] ( all n ) R [ n ] = MSB ( E ( I [ n ] ) , k ) R [ n ] = MSB ( E ( I [ n ] ) , k ) ( all n ) C [ n ] = P [ n ] ^R [ n ] P [ n ] = C [ n ] ^R [ n ] Note that for k==64 , this reduces to : I [ 0 ] = IV I [ 0 ] = IV ( n > 0 ) I [ n ] = C [ n-1 ] I [ n ] = C [ n-1 ] ( all n ) R [ n ] = E ( I [ n ] ) R [ n ] = E ( I [ n ] ) ( all n ) C [ n ] = P [ n ] ^R [ n ] P [ n ] = C [ n ] ^R [ n ] CFB notes : Since I [ n ] depends only on the plain or cipher text from the previous operation , the E ( ) function can be performed in parallel with the reception of the text with which it is used . k-bit Output FeedBack ( OFB ) : P [ n ] and C [ n ] are each k bits long , 1 < = k < = 64 . Encryption : Decryption : I [ 0 ] = IV I [ 0 ] = IV ( n > 0 ) I [ n ] = I [ n-1 ] < < k | R [ n-1 ] I [ n ] = I [ n-1 ] < < k | R [ n-1 ] ( all n ) R [ n ] = MSB ( E ( I [ n ] ) , k ) R [ n ] = MSB ( E ( I [ n ] ) , k ) ( all n ) C [ n ] = P [ n ] ^R [ n ] P [ n ] = C [ n ] ^R [ n ] Note that for k==64 , this reduces to : I [ 0 ] = IV I [ 0 ] = IV ( n > 0 ) I [ n ] = R [ n-1 ] I [ n ] = R [ n-1 ] ( all n ) R [ n ] = E ( I [ n ] ) R [ n ] = E ( I [ n ] ) ( all n ) C [ n ] = P [ n ] ^R [ n ] P [ n ] = C [ n ] ^R [ n ] OFB notes : encryption and decryption are identical . Since I [ n ] is independent of P and C , the E ( ) function can be performed in advance of the receipt of the plain/cipher text with which it is to be used . Additional notes on DES `` modes of operation '' : ECB and CBC use E ( ) to encrypt and D ( ) to decrypt , but the feedback modes use E ( ) to both encrypt and decrypt . This disproves the erroneous claim that systems which feature E ( ) but not D ( ) can not be used for data confidentiality , and therefore are not subject to export controls .

The BD 's contradicted scripture in their actions . They were NOT Christian . Simple as that . Perhaps you have read too much into what the media has portrayed . Ask any true-believing Christian and you will find that they will deny any association with the BD 's . Even the 7th Day Adventists have denied any further ties with this cult , which was what they were . Do you judge all Muslims by the acts committed by Saddam Hussein , a supposedly devout Muslim ?

Ave. , Cambridge , MA 02139 , USA +1 ( 617 ) 876-3296 Lines : 844 NNTP-Posting-Host : life.ai.mit.edu THE WHITE HOUSE Office of the Press Secretary _____________________________________________________________________ For Immediate Release April 15 , 1993 PRESS BRIEFING BY DEE DEE MYERS The Briefing Room 9:45 A.M. EDT Q Why was the 10:00 a.m. postponed ? MS. MYERS : Just due to scheduling conflicts . So as we put out , the President will meet with the leaders of the national police organizations at 2:00 p.m. in the Rose Garden , as opposed to 10:00 a.m . The only other things on his schedule today are : At 11:00 a.m. he 'll meet with General Vessey , who , as you know , is on his way to Vietnam to continue working on the MIA-POW issue . At 12:30 p.m. he 'll have lunch with the Vice President in the Oval Office . And at 2:00 p.m. he 'll meet with the police organizations . Then from 3:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. he 'll do his weekly photos with the various groups . Q A photo op with Vessey ? MS. MYERS : There 's no coverage on the Vessey meeting . Q Why ? MS. MYERS : Why ? It 's a closed meeting . Q What about the lunch ? MS. MYERS : The lunch ? No , there 's no coverage . Q Is he meeting with any congress people today ? MS. MYERS : Nothing scheduled . Q There are no meetings -- MS. MYERS : There are no congressional meetings today , no . Q Has the President been given any information by the Pentagon or reached any conclusion about the validity of this report from Hanoi ? Any instructions to Vessey on how to deal with the Vietnamese on that subject ? MS. MYERS : Well , clearly , the report is the first order of business . It 's high on the agenda on something that they 'll discuss . I think the President and General Vessey will discuss the parameters of his visit to Vietnam today , but the President has n't drawn any conclusions about the report yet . Certainly , it 's something that he wants General Vessey to talk with the Vietnamese about first . Q Did the President talk with any Republican senators yesterday about the stimulus package ? MS. MYERS : He spoke with Senator Dole . Q How many times ? MS. MYERS : I believe once during the day and once last night . Q What was the outcome of that ? MS. MYERS : They 're continuing to work toward some kind of an agreement on a jobs package . Q Is it your impression that Senator Dole is in any way flexible on this ? MS. MYERS : Well , I think we 're hopeful that we 're going to get some kind of jobs package through the Senate , and we 'll continue to work with Senator Dole and others until we reach some kind of an agreement . Q Did they discuss the VAT tax ? MS. MYERS : I do n't know if that came up . Q Can you check that ? MS. MYERS : Sure . Q So what are they -- is the President offering to scale down his program -- is that what he 's trying to do , buy it down to where Dole will sign on ? MS. MYERS : Well , he 's trying to protect as much of it as he can . But it 's important to him to get some kind of a jobs package through the Senate and through Congress now . And as soon as we reach some conclusions on that , we 'll let you know . But at the moment , he 's continuing to consult with members of Congress including , obviously , Senator Dole . Q Is he talking to anybody else ? MS. MYERS : I do n't believe he talked to any other Republicans yesterday . Q Is he talking to anybody today ? MS. MYERS : I do n't think anything is scheduled , but I would n't rule it out . Q We were led to believe that the President called Mr. Dole on the subject of Russian aid and that Bob Dole brought the conversation around to stimulus package . Is that correct ? MS. MYERS : I think the President has contacted several people on Russian aid . I think that it was always expected that the stimulus package or the jobs package will be part of any conversation he would have with Senator Dole . The primary objective of the conversation was Russian aid . That was the first order of business , but it was both . Q In the President 's mind , are they linked politically in that if the Republicans continue to reject the stimulus package , he thinks it will be harder to sell Russian aid to the American people ? Has he made that argument ? MS. MYERS : I ca n't talk about specifically what arguments he might have made . The President is obviously committed to both . He liked to see a jobs package to the American people first . But as you know , we outlined the details of additional Russian aid last night in Tokyo . Q But does the President believe that the stimulus package will make it more difficult to persuade Americans to vote for Russian -- to accept a vote for Russian aid ? MS. MYERS : I think that the President is going to continue to work to pass the stimulus package , to pass a jobs package , and we 're still hopeful that we 'll get some kind of jobs package through the Congress . Q Is it fair to say that the President is negotiating now with Dole ? MS. MYERS : He 's discussing options with him . Q On the stimulus , is it your understanding that over the break some Democrats , themselves , have left the support that they had earlier for the package , the stimulus package ? MS. MYERS : I think we still have wide support in the Senate for the jobs package . Q But specifically , that you 've lost Democrats other than Shelby ? MS. MYERS : I do n't believe so . There has n't been a vote . Q What about Kohl ? Q Kohl and Feingold ? MS. MYERS : There has n't been a vote yet . And we 'll continue to work with senators to try to get a majority to try to bring the package to a vote , because we believe that a majority of the members of the United States Senate support the package . Q If you 're were n't worried about Kohl and Feingold , why did George mention Milwaukee projects the other day ? MS. MYERS : I think George pointed out a number of projects in a number of states that stand to be funded , or to lose funding if this jobs package does n't pass . Q No Democrats . ( Laughter . ) MS. MYERS : I 'll let you draw your own conclusions . Q Does he plan to talk to Dole again today or any other Republicans again today ? MS. MYERS : There 's nothing specifically scheduled , but again , I would n't rule it out . Q Does he plan to put out any more press releases to any other states today ? MS. MYERS : What we 've done is we 're in the process of breaking down the benefits of the jobs package state by state . I think it 's entirely feasible that as we sort of are able to sum those up , we 'll send out press releases to the various states that suggest how their states would benefit from this package . Q Will you share those with us ? MS. MYERS : Sure . As we did yesterday . Q Do you have copies of the ones you sent -- MS. MYERS : Yes , we made those available yesterday . And we certainly can continue to provide them today . Q Dee Dee , since yesterday 's questions and subsequent stories about the VAT , what further consideration of this issue has been given ? MS. MYERS : Nothing 's changed since yesterday . I think the President commented on it this morning to say only that it was something he knew was being considered by the task force and that he has not made a decision on , and I do n't think we have anything to add to that . Q But he also said that business and labor groups are telling him they support it . Can you tell us -- MS. MYERS : I think that there has been -- I 'm not going to speculate on who supports it . I think the President said that there has been some support among business and labor groups . I do n't think he said he was directly contacted by them . Q Are we to take that to mean that the administration has sounded out business and labor groups on this -- MS. MYERS : I think there 's been plenty of public discourse on this over the years and even recently , but I do n't think I want to add to that . Q In February , though , the President said that this was something to be considered 10 or 15 years down the road . What has happened between then and now to cause this administration to change its mind ? MS. MYERS : I think as we said yesterday , it is something that the working groups are looking at . They 're considering a wide variety of options on everything from funding to specific options that will be covered by the President 's health care plan . The President has not taken it up yet , has not made a decision on it . And beyond that , I do n't have anything to add . Q You have n't answered the question . It was n't being considered by anyone in the White House after the President 's comments in February , and George reaffirmed that in a briefing . Q And then suddenly -- Q What happened ? MS. MYERS : The working groups , as we have said throughout , we instructed to consider a wide variety of options across-the-board . And one of the things that has been talked about and that they are clearly considering is some kind of a value-added tax . Q But the President himself took this off the table , Dee Dee , and suddenly it reappears . And this goes to the credibility of this administration in a way . What has happened in the meantime ? MS. MYERS : The President has not looked at this , it has n't been presented to him , again , yet . The working groups are looking at it , as they 're looking at a wide variety of options , and no decisions have been made . Q And it raises the question of how independently the task force is working . MS. MYERS : The task force was instructed to consider all options , and they 've taken that mandate seriously and they 're considering all options . Q But that 's not the impression that the President left in February . The impression he left was that this was something that was long-range , to be looked at 10 , 15 years down the road . The clear implication of his remarks was that this was something that was not on the table , not an option . Q `` If it changes I 'll tell you . '' Q Bring him on . Q And you repeatedly referred to the President 's remarks , telling us that those were still in operation . MS. MYERS : It 's changed , and we told you . ( Laughter . ) Q But that 's what Alice Rivlin 's comments and Donna Shalala comments were about . I mean , that seemed like an orchestrated effort because you have two independent Cabinet officers -- MS. MYERS : I would n't -- no , Alice Rivlin 's not a Cabinet member , first of all . Second of all , it was not orchestrated , but clearly , they both said yesterday and in the last couple of days that it 's something that 's being looked at . We confirmed that yesterday . And I do n't have anything to add to that . Q Is it because he has very few options ? Q Is this something that it will be incumbent upon the task force to convince the President about ? In other words , has the President himself personally ruled it out and it 's now up to the task force to convince him to put it back on the table ? Or is it , in fact , back on the table , having been placed there by discussions with the President ? MS. MYERS : It is not the working group 's mission at this point to convince the President of anything . It is their mission to put before him his options and to explain the benefits and the costs and the basic pros and cons of each of those options . I think that they will certainly present the VAT to him in that context , and at this point he 's not -- that presentation has not been made , but it 's something that he will hear and he has not made a decision on . Q They will present it to him as one of his options , though he specifically ruled it out ? MS. MYERS : Correct . Q Dee Dee , is this more than a trial balloon ? Is this a serious consideration that the working groups are giving to this form of taxation ? MS. MYERS : It 's simply a statement of fact . The working groups are considering a wide variety of options on a number of issues relating to health care reform . One of the options that they 're looking at is the VAT . Q Dee Dee , when the working groups were examining this possibility , was this on the table during the same time period that you were telling us that it was not ? MS. MYERS : I do n't know what the specific timing of their drafting of options is . I do n't know . Q Who was telling you that it was not under consideration ? MS. MYERS : I was referring back to the President 's comments . Q Have they discovered that the sin taxes wo n't raise enough money to fund the core benefit package ? MS. MYERS : No , there 's no decisions that have been made on how to pay for the health care plan . Q I 'm asking whether the projections -- MS. MYERS : There 's a number of options depending on how the plan is structured . You ca n't decide how much the plan is going to cost until you decide what the plan is going to look like . And so you ca n't discuss what financing options have been ruled in our out until you know . Q Dee Dee , we 've been told that they have a computer models on a number of possible packages . MS. MYERS : Correct . Q The question is whether they have now determined whether sin taxes would not produce enough money for even the barest minimum package . That is not a very difficult computation . MS. MYERS : It is a question that you know that we 're not going to answer until -- there 's a number of options being considered . It depends on how the package is structured . The exact details of the package and the financing mechanisms used to pay for them are all among the decisions that have yet to be made . Q And when the President has been meeting with health care -- his health care advisors , which we are told he has been doing -- MS. MYERS : Correct . Q they have never once said to him , these are your funding options , including the VAT ? He has never heard the word VAT in his -- MS. MYERS : I am not going to comment on the specific nature of the daily -- they 're not daily , but the quasi-regular briefings . Q Well , you have . MS. MYERS : I have not , other than to say that he 's not considered the VAT . And I think that is a true statement . Q No , but you said that it has not been presented to him as an option . MS. MYERS : Correct . Q That does n't mean he has n't heard about it . MS. MYERS : I 'm not going to get into the details of what 's discussed . I think that statement stands for itself . Q specific , Dee Dee . When you say he has n't looked at it , do you mean that he has n't looked at it in terms of paying for medical coverage , or has n't looked at it in general ? Because back in Chilicothe he was very specific in defining how it works , what the advantages are , the whole thing . It sounds like -- MS. MYERS : But that was -- I think in Chilicothe , if you go back to his remarks there , it was a broader philosophical discussion of the tax structure . And I think the comments were generally in reference to the overall economic plan . But clearly , it 's something that he 's thought about in the broad context . I mean , that was clear in Chilicothe . What I 'm saying is that in the process of the working groups it 's something that he has n't considered yet . It 's something that the working groups will present to him among the number of options , and that no decisions have been made . And I 'm not going to comment any further on the details of the meetings where health care issues are being discussed . Q It 's your statement from this podium that no discussion of this has taken place . You say that no option -- that the option has not been presented to him . MS. MYERS : That is correct . Q Do you stand by -- does the White House still stand by George 's statement in March that this will not be in the proposal ? MS. MYERS : No decisions have been made . We have nothing to add to what 's already been said . Q Let me follow up here . Do you stand by what Rivlin said yesterday , that if any kind of VAT were to be used or considered , that other changes to the tax code would have to be made so that it would be less regressive ? MS. MYERS : I 'm not going to comment any further on what might happen if . Q But do you stand by the previous conversations in February that if there were to be a VAT , I think the President said you 'd exclude food and energy -- MS. MYERS : I 'm not going to comment on the specific structure of a decision that has n't been made . Q Was the President aware prior to Donna Shalala 's comments yesterday that this was under consideration by the working groups ? MS. MYERS : I do n't know specifically what -- Q Could you check for us , because that 's a real important credibility question ? MS. MYERS : Sure . Q Since the task force was brought together this issue has been discussed , at the beginning and throughout , as one fairly painless way to raise a lot of money . Were you all kept in the dark ? Was the Press Office kept in the dark over the past month and a half when you 've been denying that a VAT tax would be considered that it was actually on the table over there as an option ? MS. MYERS : I think we 've said all that we have to say . It is something the working groups are looking at . The President has not made a decision about it yet . And beyond that , I have nothing to add . Q Well , sorry , Dee Dee , there are still a couple of questions that we are going to have to ask because we have a problem with credibility here -- yours primarily . What we 're asking is , if you all were not told at all that this thing was being considered while you were coming out here and telling us that it was not , or if it 's a case that you were coming out here and deliberately misleading us . MS. MYERS : I do n't believe that anyone has ever come out here and deliberately misled you from this podium -- ever -- ever . Q Has anyone tried to shade it a little bit to indicate something -- has anybody told anybody to come out -- MS. MYERS : We 're not trying to shade answers or deliberately mislead anybody . I 've said what I have to say about this issue . Q All we were trying to find out -- MS. MYERS : I understand what you 're trying to find out and I 've given you the answers , Helen . Q We 're trying to find out what changed -- what made it an option again . That 's the -- MS. MYERS : The working groups were given a broad mandate to investigate all options , and they are doing that . Q Yes , but it was n't an option before . How can you investigate it if the President has taken it off the table ? MS. MYERS : It is something that they 're obviously considering and the President has not made a decision on . Q Yes , but he took it off the table in February . MS. MYERS : Working groups are considering it . They 'll present it to the President at some point and he 'll make a decision . Q Why would they consider it if he has taken it off the table ? MS. MYERS : It 's clearly on the table . Q Yes , but he took it off the table . Did he change his mind ? MS. MYERS : It 's back on the table , Bill . Q Did he change his mind ? MS. MYERS : He said this morning that he has n't made a decision about it . He obviously knows that it 's on the table . It 's something that he will look at at some and when we have a decision on this we 'll let you know . Q So he must have changed his mind , right ? MS. MYERS : At some point it will be looked at . I mean , -- Q Dee Dee , there 's like two options -- either he changed his mind or the working groups think they 're authority exceeds the President 's . MS. MYERS : The working groups were given a broad mandate to look at all options ; they 've done that . Q Are you going to put out his income tax ? MS. MYERS : Yes , there will be something available on his income tax probably later this afternoon . His return will be available . Q Will there be any kind of briefing to go through it ? MS. MYERS : No , nothing 's planned . I think someone will be available , probably not in a briefing setting , but to walk you through the questions . Q We 're used to be walked line-by-line through the presidential tax forms . MS. MYERS : I 've seen those briefings . ( Laughter . ) Q Could we have one ? MS. MYERS : No , I do n't think there will be any kind of a formal briefing , but there will be somebody available to answer your questions about it . Q Did they file a joint form ? MS. MYERS : Yes . Q When did he file it ? MS. MYERS : I believe it 's being filed today . Q Dee Dee , is there going to be a backgrounder for Miyazawa ? MS. MYERS : No , there will be a readout after the meeting . Q No backgrounder today ? MS. MYERS : No backgrounder today . Q This is complicated stuff . We need help . ( Laughter . ) MS. MYERS : We ca n't give you taxes and Miyazawa all in one day , it 's too confusing . ( Laughter . ) Q Vance and Owen have opened the doors on the use of force in Bosnia . They 've both said that , A , they never ruled it out , and B , it might be necessary now . Does that influence your thinking on whether or not to change your approach ? MS. MYERS : There 's been no change in our policy towards Bosnia . We have always said that we 'd consider -- Q But does that impact upon your decision ? Are they people whose opinions would carry weight with you ? MS. MYERS : They 're people whose opinions carry weight certainly . I mean , the President supports the process that they 've initiated . But there 's been no change in our policy for Bosnia , although we 're considering a number of options right now . If the Serbs do n't come back to the negotiating table , if they do n't sign on to some kind of an agreement , we will consider additional options , which we 've been saying regularly . Q One follow-up question then ? We can not get a straight answer from anyone in the administration . Why do you not set a deadline for the Serbs ? Can you tell us the strategic or tactical reasons for not giving them a deadline to come to the table ? MS. MYERS : We 're continuing to put pressure on them every day . Q Which does n't work so -- MS. MYERS : Well , we think it is having some effect . We 're going to continue to tighten sanctions . As you know , we support the omnibus resolution . We expect that to come to a vote on the 26th . Q You say it 's having an effect -- can you give us any documentation ? MS. MYERS : I 'd be happy to provide somebody to talk to you about the impact of the sanctions and things like that . Q There 's been no -- you have not been able to provide anybody who can tell us that the sanctions have had any effect in Bosnia . Serbia , yes ; in Bosnia , no . MS. MYERS : I think that they 've had effect in Serbia and we think they 've had some effect in Bosnia . And again , I 'll be happy to provide somebody to walk you through the details of that , if you 'd like . Q We would like to hear from someone who can show us what the effect has been in Bosnia . We had the briefing on all of the terrible things that are happening in Belgrade , but we have n't seen anything that indicates an impact on the fighting . Can you provide something along those lines ? MS. MYERS : I will see what I can get you . Q On the extra Russian aid that Christopher announced this morning -- where is that money coming from ? MS. MYERS : We 'll have to work with Congress on the details of that package . Q So that would be new money that you would hope to get ? MS. MYERS : Yes , that 's new money , in addition to the $ 1.6 billion announced in Vancouver . So I assume that you all have seen the $ 1.8-billion package that was announced this morning in Tokyo by Secretary Christopher . Q Is n't there a concern , though , about offering something which you have to get in Congress ? I mean , that was the concern with Vancouver ; you did n't want to do that . MS. MYERS : The concern with Vancouver was to do something immediately , which required money that was already approved in the Fiscal '93 budget . What we 're looking at now is a little bit longer-term plan to build on top of the $ 1.6 billion that we announced in Vancouver . This clearly will require congressional approval , or some of it will anyway , and we 're going to continue to work with Congress to make that happen . Q To what extent has that been vetted or agreed to by Congress ? MS. MYERS : The President has had a number of conversations with members and will continue to work with them as this process moves forward . Q Was Christopher able to put this package out with a fair degree of understanding that you will be able to get it through Congress ? MS. MYERS : It was created in consultation with Congress . Q In meeting with the law enforcement officials , is that -- does that have a set speech and a goal ? A direction ? MS. MYERS : Yes , the President will talk about -- and the law enforcement organizations are endorsing the President 's jobs package . They believe particularly the summer jobs package will help give kids something to do . Q Who are they ? MS. MYERS : It 's members or leadership from three organizations : NAPO , which is the National Association of Police Organizations ; IBPO , which is the International Brotherhood of Police Organizations , I believe ; and IUPA , which is the International Union of Police Associations . Q Will the FBI chief be there ? MS. MYERS : The FBI chief ? No . Q Or any other federal law enforcement officials ? MS. MYERS : No , it will be the President and these national law enforcement organization leaders . Q Does the $ 1.8 billion announced today include the $ 400 million that 's in the FY '94 budget for disarmament ? MS. MYERS : No . The Nunn-Lugar money is separate . Q So this would be the $ 700 million that 's in the budget already , plus another $ 1.1 billion ? MS. MYERS : I believe all of this is on top of the $ 700 million already in the budget . Q Is this going to be part of the supplemental or Fiscal '94 -- MS. MYERS : We 'll work with Congress on the exact funding mechanism -- on exactly how this will be paid for . Q This $ 1.8 billion on top of -- MS. MYERS : On top of $ 700 million -- on top of the $ 400 million Nunn-Lugar money we announced earlier . Q And this is what prompted the President to call Bob Dole -- it was on this tranche , not on the previous money he was calling Bob Dole ? MS. MYERS : Correct . Q Is there a briefing on Miyazawa ? MS. MYERS : There will be a readout after the meeting with Miyazawa . Tomorrow . Q Dee Dee , on a totally unrelated matter , some Republicans who are active in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are complaining about this new cozy relationship between the White House and the Chamber of Commerce . There are -- the town hall meeting the other night , the satellite and all of this relationship . Does the White House feel that you 're getting too close to these Chambers of Commerce ? MS. MYERS : That 's an interesting charge . ( Laughter . ) After how many years of Democrats being accused of not paying any attention to the Chambers , now there are those who would accuse us of being too close . I think that 's interesting . But no , we 're thrilled by the support we 've received from the national Chamber and local Chambers across the country and we 'll continue to work with them on this and other initiatives . Q What 's the status of the President thinking about going to this Democratic retreat ? MS. MYERS : It 's on his calendar . I think he 'll almost certainly go . Q All three days ? MS. MYERS : We have n't figured out exactly when he 'll be there yet . Q Is it open to coverage ? MS. MYERS : No , I believe the whole thing is closed . Q Is he going to have any kind of address , statement , anything at all on the gay rights march on the 25th ? MS. MYERS : We 're still looking at that . We have n't made a final decision about how we 'll -- who will make a statement or what -- Q Any meetings scheduled with any of the leaders ? MS. MYERS : Nothing is scheduled , but I would n't rule it out . Q What about an AIDS czar ? MS. MYERS : It 's coming . Q Anything on the weekend ? Q There 's been a suggestion that he 's going to this retreat to avoid having to participate in the gay rights -- or appear or have any involvement in the gay rights march . MS. MYERS : No , I think this is something he 's been discussing for a long time -- appearing at the Senate Democratic retreat . Q The weekend ? MS. MYERS : Weekend ? Do n't know -- the only thing on right now is the radio address on Saturday . Q Any travel plans ? MS. MYERS : If it changes -- none right now . Q He 's not going to be off campaigning for his stimulus package ? MS. MYERS : No specific plans right now . Q What about mid-week ? Anything likely ? MS. MYERS : It 's possible . Yes , I think it 's likely that we 'll travel next week -- certainly the weekend . Q Has he called Thurmond about his daughter ? MS. MYERS : I do n't know . I 'll check . Q Going to name a drug czar this weekend ? MS. MYERS : This weekend ? I do n't believe so . Q And the radio address on Saturday -- is that going to be focused on the stimulus package ? MS. MYERS : I 'm sure it will . THE PRESS : Thank you . END10:10 A.M. EDT

From : brad @ optilink.COM ( Brad Yearwood ) Subject : Clipper considered harmful Organization : Optilink Corporation , Petaluma , CA Lines : 48 If Clipper comes to cellular phones along with legal proscriptions against using other cipher systems on these phones , a new and potentially dangerous class of crime is created . Criminals who very badly want inscrutable tactical communications ( specifically the terrorists and drug dealers who proponents of key escrow cite as threats ) will be highly motivated to steal the cipher phone of a legitimate user , and to kill this person or hold them hostage so discovery of compromise of the device will be delayed . Once a suitable collection of devices is stolen , criminals can communicate with impunity ( assuming the cipher system carries no trapdoors apart from key escrow ) until and unless the compromise is discovered by some other means . Because life-is-cheap criminals are currently willing to kill people to steal very large and conspicuous property ( luxury cars ) , it is reasonable to assume that they will be willing to kill people to steal small and inconspicuous property ( a cipher cellular phone ) . Just as we have seen in the past with '' blue box '' technology , and in the present with modified cellular phones , we can expect to see among high-stakes criminals a lucrative market for stolen cipher phones which can be used for a few days . The high-stakes criminals will pay the life-is-cheap types substantial amounts for stolen instruments . Because a person is typically discovered as missing or dead in a few days , a stolen instrument will be usable for only a few days . There will be a continuing demand for fresh phones : fresh bodies . In other words , Clipper and similar systems have the potential to turn a current inconvenience to law enforcement into a direct , vicious , and persistent threat to the general public . On the other hand , if a criminal were to apply some arbitrary cipher to a device in a mostly non-ciphered network , the communication will at least stand out as being unusual , and perhaps worthy of other means of investigation . Finally , because there is essentially no possibility of intercepting in realtime the scrutable content of communications between stolen instruments , there will exist strong motivation to record and archive _all_ communications in the network for ex-post-facto scrutiny ( once some criminal act is discovered , and the instruments involved have been identified ) . While recording and archiving may not be feasible for wireline networks , it is probably feasible across the more limited bandwidth of radio networks . The existence of these recordings could open up vast potential for abuse . Brad Yearwood brad @ optilink.com { uunet , pyramid } ! optilink ! brad Petaluma , CA

I agree entirely . Speaking as an atheist ( heterosexual , for what it's worth ) , this is one of the least attractive parts of some varieties of Christianity . Although I 'm sure it 's possible to argue theologically that we should n't make analogies between discrimination on the basis of sex and race and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation , morally the case looks unanswerable ( for those outside religion ) : the three forms _are_ analogous ; we should n't discriminate on the basis of sex , race or sexual orientation . I found the moderator 's FAQs on the subject instructive , and recommend everyone to read them . There seem to be three different levels of acceptance : 1 ) Regard homosexual orientation as a sin ( or evil , whatever ) 2 ) Regard homosexual behaviour as a sin , but accept orientation ( though presumably orientation is unfortunate ) and dislike people who indulge 3 ) As 2 , but `` love the sinner '' 4 ) Accept homosexuality altogether . My experience is that 3 is the most common attitude ( I imagine 1 and 2 are limited to a few fundamentalist sects ) . I suppose I can go along with 3 , except that I have this feeling that a 14 -- 15 year old living in a community with this attitude , on discovering that they were more attracted to members of the same sex , would not feel the love of the community , but would rather feel the pressure not to exhibit their feelings . I 'm not saying that the community ( in particular the parents ) would not love the child , but I suspect the child would not feel loved . -- Bruce CMSR , University of Liverpool

I hope you realize how trivial it is to manufacture these compounds . Given about $ 10k in lab equipment and chemicals ( which are commercially available ) and given the knowledge that I have ( graduating BS , Ch , 1993 ) I could synthesize enough of these compounds to make a serious dent in the population of several major US cities . As also noted , the knowledge is there for the production of nuclear weapons . It 's not even that restricted . The only thing is the expense . Now I 'm not going around making these things , but it 's not 'cause of any law ; I simply do n't get any marginal benefit out of killing anyone . Any law you enact in this respect is only going to give you the ability to add a charge against someone who does make and use said weapons . In the case of chemical agents , I seriously doubt that you would even know that someone had set up a lab until after the weapons had been used . Part of the trouble with the chemical-weapons ban treaty between the US and the USSR is that many of the precursors to chemical weapons such as GB and Sarin , etc. , is that they have very valid commercial uses , and it is very easy to divert those precursors to chemical weapons manufacture without anyone knowing about it . > > < Dan Sorenson , DoD # 1066 z1dan @ exnet.iastate.edu viking @ iastate.edu > > > < ISU only censors what I read , not what I say .

This makes sense , as presumably the Image version with NDW is newer than the one with NU . It did not , however , install smartcan in the autoexec .

There are a number of other factors that are very important , the three biggest being air velocity , air momentum and shock waves . Velocity stacks have been used for years and are now being used inside of stock airboxes on a number of bikes . At a tuned engine rpm , the stacks can greatly increase the speed , and thus momentum of the air rushing in . Air momentum is critical in getting good air intake : the momentum of the air stack outside the combustion chamber will force its way inside long after the piston has begun its compressive up-stroke . Shock waves are used to induce air intake and to prevent fresh air from escaping out the exzhaust ports . Shock waves are the product of expansion chambers or any other means of presenting a 'wall ' ( opening or closing ) to the air in motion . Beyond this I am lost in the mystery of how they design for shock waves . < ================================================ > / Rich Sturges ( h ) 703-536-4443 \ / NSWC - Carderock Division ( w ) 301-227-1670 \ / `` I speak for no one else , and listen to the same .

Time for a new discussion , maybe ? I asked in these groups some time ago what about the TC++/VE , and got no answers , so I decided to try . My brother who lives in the US bought and sent it to me , and I 'm still trying to get used to it . Before I put my good/bad points list , consider I am a Turbo Pascal/DOS programmer , and sometimes try to make something in Unix with C ( just some exercises from university ) . I used to make some programs in Microsoft C version 5 ( ! ! ) because we used some third-party libraries that required that . - I like Borland . It seems to me much more easier to use than Microsoft , specially the debugger . I tried to learn Codeview sometimes , but never felt confortable with it . - TC++ V/E seems very nice to create simple apps , like the examples on the ObjectWindows book . So far , no problems . Lets see next week or so , when I will try something more complex . - It works nice even in my `` weak '' machine 386/16Mhz , 6 Mb Ram . But ... .. - The manual for the Resource Workshop seems to be from a different version from the Workshop itself . Some of the windows that appear on the manual have more itens than in the manual . - I think I will run into trouble since I got this TC++/VE from my brother as a present . I didnt wanted to buy the Japanese version because 1 ) I suspect that the manuals will be in Japanese : - ( and 2 ) I believe it will be far more expensive here . So he bought it as a present and sent to me , I send the registration card to the Japanese branch of Borland , but ... who knows . So , I 'd like to ask some questions for you all ; - I know that there are some Microsoft guys around here in this group . Is there anybody from Borland ? Is there any e-mail address that we can contact the technical support ? Not for stupid questions , but to ask for example , why the RW manual seems to be different from the RW itself ? - Is there anybody else using it around here ? - Will the book of Petzold be useful for me ? I intend to use RW and ProtoGen to make the interfaces and then work on the code itself . Answers to my e-mail or comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.tools , please . Thanks in advance , Rafael .

Or Darrell > Evans ! Yeah , yeah ! After the Hall of Fame takes in them , it can take in > Eddie Murray and Jeff Reardon . Oh , yeah . Dave Winfield -- marginal player . Guy did n't hit a lick , had negligible power , was a crap fielder and had no staying power . Dave Winfield , now entering his ( I believe ) 20th big league season , is still a damn decent hitter . Admittedly , his defense has slipped a great deal , but in his prime , he had a powerful arm and great range . Take a look at the stats : I do n't know where you even BEGIN to make an argument that Winfield and Kingman are similar players . Kingman was a one-dimension power hitter -- he could n't field , he ran like an anvil , hit for a low average ( though , if I remember right , his OBP was n't THAT hideous ... ) , and ( for those who consider such things important ) was a absolute-primo-dick . Eddie Murray ? Yup , only the best 1st baseman of the 80 's . I know that MVP votes are conducted by mediots , but given that he got jobbed out of the MVP he deserved in 1983 , it seems that he was n't overrated by the media . Lee Smith ? Hmmmm ... This one 's actually pretty close . He 's had a s solid , dependable career as a closer despite pitching in some nasty parks ( Wrigley , Fenway ... ) . I 'd have to take a closer look at the stats ( it 's been a while ) , but it seems Lee Arthur is of HOF caliber . You do make a legitimate point about the HOF credentials of relievers , simply racking up a lot of saves does n't mean a whole hell of a lot if you blow a bunch , too . Simply because Minnesota and Boston and ( for a month ) Atlanta used Reardon as a closer for longer than he should have been one , the Equalizer has racked up an impressive number of saves . No way should HomerMan be in the HOF , IMHO . Darrell Evans ? Nice career , actually a bit underrated ( kinda like Ted Simmons , IMHO ) , but not a HOF'er . > Well , in any case , I am sick and tired ( mostly sick ) of everybody > giving Hall of Fame consideration to players that are by today 's standards , > marginal . Lem me ask you this . Who the hell playing the game IS N'T marginal ? > Honestly , Ozzie Smith and Robin Yount do n't belong there . They 're both > shortstops that just hung around for a long time . Big deal . > Let 's be a little more selective , huh ? Stop handing out these honors so > liberally . Save them for the guys who really deserve it . Face it , if something Now , wait a goddamn minute here . Ozzie Smith absolutely REDEFINED the position of shortstop . His defense was SO good that he 's won something along the lines of 10 Gold Gloves . Again , Gold Gloves are mediot-biased , and a good argument could be made that Larkin deserved one or two of Ozzie 's more recent awards , but usually , this is tempered by someone else in the early 80 's getting the Gold Gloves Ozzie deserved earlier in his career . Ozzie's offense , you ask ? Good OBP , great speed numbers , in a park which , for most of his career , depressed offense , admittedly , no power ( 'cept against Tom Niedenfuer : -| ) , but still , a definite asset offensively . Yount ? 3,000 hits , MVP at two different positions , uh-huh , a real stiff . His '82 was one of the great years EVER by a player in recent memory , and probably ranks behind only the peak seasons of Wagner and Banks , as far as SS numbers go . He 's a clear HOF'er , IMHO . > is n't done , there will be little prestige in the Hall of Fame anymore . When > certain individuals believe that Steve Garvey or Jack Morris are potential > candidates , the absurdity is apparent . Gee , can these guys even compare to > the more likely future Hall of Famers like Kirby Puckett or Nolan Ryan ? Well , as far as Garvey goes , you 're right . Garvey is a `` mediot '' candidate , pushed because of his `` winning attitude '' ( a minor factor , if one at all ) , and his `` great defense '' ( no errors , admittedly , but the range of a tree stump ... ) . Garvey should n't be in the HOF . SkyJack ? I 've said a lot of nasty things about SkyJack in the last year or so , but this is mostly in response to mediots and woofers who talk about Morris ' `` ability to win '' which is nothing more than Morris ' `` ability to pitch when Toronto to score tons of runs '' . At this point , Morris is an average pitcher ( although from his early returns in '93 , he may be damned close to done. ) . But , in all fairness , Morris was a dominant pitcher in the 80 's for up-and-down Tiger teams . While 1984 was ( obviously ) a great year for Detroit , the rest of the decade , the team was generally in contention , but not favorites . Morris ' career numbers are quite good , and worthy of HOF '' consideration '' . Ryan ? Of course , but be careful . I guarantee you that someone will throw back your earlier logic about `` Yount and Smith being shortstops who hung around a long time '' . After all , Nolan never won a Cy ... Damn , he 's just pitcher who hung around for 99 years ... His W-L record is mediocre ... ( Of course , Nolan 's a HOF'er ... ) Puck ? Probably , although he 's got to play reasonably well for a few more years ( 10 years , even good ones , are n't enough to make the HOF , most likely ) . That said , I believe Puckett WILL make the HOF , pretty much regardless of how the rest of his career turns out ( barring something REALLY tragic or sudden ) . He 's very popular in the media and with fans , and legitimately has been one of the best CF 's in the game since he joined the league . I 've always liked the guy , and I hope he does make it . And , in the end , I think the Puck will make it in . But , really , it 's too early to sell . This debate comes up rather frequently on the net , and , believe it or not , I never tire of it . It 's an interesting subject . Here 's an off the top of my head list of potential HOF'ers from each team . I probably left a couple of guys off , so feel free to follow up . I wo n't consider ANYONE who started playing after about 1985 ( again , too early to tell . ) [ Note : these are all active players , I 'm not counting recent retirees ] Baltimore : Cal Ripken ( should be a lock by now , even if Gehrig 's record stands ) Boston : Roger Clemens ( might be a lock already , which is amazing ) , Dawson ( ? ) Detroit : Alan Trammell and Lou Whitaker ( possibilities ) Milwaukee : Robin Yount ( discussed earlier ) New York : Wade Boggs ( possibly ) , Mattingly ( long shot ) Toronto : Paul Molitor and Jack Morris ( possibilities ) Kansas City : George Brett ( lock ) Minnesota : Kirby ( too early to tell ) , Winfield ( lock ) Oakland : Eckersley ( lock ) , McGwire ( too early ) , Rickey ( lock ) , Welch ( LONG shot ) Texas : The Mighty Nolan [ Too early to consider Canseco or Strange : - ) ] Cubs : Sandberg ( lock ) St. Louis : Ozzie ( lock ) , Lee Smith ( probably ) New York : Murray ( almost a lock ) , Saberhagen ( obviously , he 's got to regain past form ) [ And most certainly , NOT Vince Coleman , despite what he 'll tell you : - ) ] Los Angeles : Butler , Strawberry , and Hershiser are all long shots . San Diego : Tony Gwynn ( pretty good shot ) Colorado : Dale Murphy ( a good shot ) , Ryan Bowen ( just to see if you 're awake ) [ Before I get flames : this is an off-the-top-of-the-head list , there's probably a few deserving candidates that I left off , and , I did n't include Barry Bonds , Will Clark , Any Atlanta Starting Pitcher , Frank Thomas , Canseco , McGriff , etc . because I only considered guys who started playing before 1985 ) ] E-mail or post , I almost fear what I may have started here ... -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Bruce Hasch hasch @ jhuvms.hcf.jhu.edu Sell the team , Eli ! ! `` If a hitter is a good fastball hitter , does that mean I should throw him a bad fastball ?

So were their non-Christian contemporaries ( the more familiar you are with late Republican Rome or the Pricipate , the weirder those people will seem -- forget the creative filtering done by Renaissance and Eighteenth Century hero worship . ) So are modern non-Christians . And Christians . You are pretty weird , yourself , with your rather acid dismissal of Luther and of Protestantism -- and in apparently buying into a simplistic propaganda model about Catholicism *not* being faddish . Sure , it 's so large that global fads take longer cycles than they do in smaller denominations ( and local ones are not usually visible unless you do a lot of traveling to exotic lands : - ) ) . May I recom- mend , as a salutary antidote to this nonsense Philippe Aries ' book _The Hour of our Death_ , a longitudinal study of death customs in Western [ specifically Catholic ] Christendom ? And it wo n't help to escape into the obscurity of the first Christian century . Paul was pretty weird , too ; as were Peter and the others in the ( apparently quite weird ) circle around Jesus . What I think you might find helpful is a bit more charity -- try to understand these weirdos and nutcases with the same respect and love you would expect others to show YOUR notions . We *are* commanded to love one another , after all . And Brown 's book is , in fact , a heroic attempt to SEE the groupings he talks about as motivated in love and the gospel and their social contexts . ( If anything , Brown is *too* heroic here -- he manages to overstrain himself at times : - ) ) I do n't suggest that we *follow* any of these old cult paths -- and it raises hard questions from the skeptic inside me that so much of early Christianity *was* like the weird ( Christian and non-Christian ) cults we see today . To that extent , I think you raise a serious problem ( and perhaps your phrasing is implicitly self-deprecatory and ironic . ) But the first principle for *answering* these questions is respect and love for those we do not understand . And it helps to *work* at under- standing ( as long as we do not get overwhelmed by revulsion and begin to withdraw our respect for them as people . ) I would advise , in other words , MORE historical reading ( Brown 's other books are also good , most especially his bio . of Augustine ; also try Robin Lane Fox 's _Christians and Pagans_ , maybe the Paul Veyne ed . _History of Private Life_ , some of Foucault 's books on sexuality in the ancient world ... ) Humanity *is* weird -- we have known ONE sane person , and we killed Him . Fortunately for us , this has proved a Comedy rather than a Tragedy . Easter , 1993 . ( yes ; this is a tad early -- our Vigil service here has been moved forward because so many churches in the area have taken to doing their own Vigils , and the seminarians must therefore worship-and-run if they are to do it here and there as well .

Still , the man actually had the gall to say that one out of every six pitchers in the NL this year did not pitch in the majors last year . Huh ? IMO , this expansion will not see the explosive jump in offense that the other expansion drafts had , since the talent was diluted over both leagues . In Gammons ' defense , because the talent drain came from the AL as well , some increase will be seen . He also gets credit for mentioning that the 1969 jump in offense was due also to the rules changes after the 1968 season .

The `` so sacred it 's secret '' explanation is a bit misleading . While there is a profound reverence for the temple endowment , there is no injunction against discussing the ceremony itself in public . But since public discussion is often irreverent , most Mormons would rather keep silent than have a cherished practice maligned . But there are certain elements of the ceremony which participants explicitly covenant not to reveal except in conjunction with the ceremony itself . | Granted , the Gnostic `` Christians '' | had their secret rituals , but these seem to have been taken entirely | from pagan pre-Christian mystery religions . There are other interpretations to Christian history in this matter . One must recall that most of what we know about the Gnostics was written by their enemies . Eusebius claims that Jesus imparted secret information to Peter , James , and John after His resurrection , and that those apostles transmitted that information to the rest of the Twelve ( Eusebius , _Historia Ecclesiastica_ II 1:3-4 ) . Irenaeus claims this information was passed on to the priests and bishops ( _Against Heresies_ IV 33:8 ) , but Eusebius disagrees . He claims the secret ceremonies of the Christian church perished with the apostles . Interestingly enough , Eusebius refers to the groups which we today call Gnostics as promulgators of a false gnosis ( Eusebius , op . cit. , III , 32:7-8 ) . His gripe was not that thay professed *a* gnosis , but that they had the *wrong* one . Writings dealing with Jesus ' post-resurrection teachings emphasize secrecy -- not so much a concealment as a policy of not teaching certain things indiscriminately . In one story , Simon Magus opens a dialog with Peter on the nature of God . Peter 's response is `` You seem to me not to know what a father and a God is : But I could tell you both whence souls are , and when and how they were made ; but it is not permitted to me now to disclose these things to you '' ( _Clementine Recognitions_ II , 60 ) . If any one theme underlies the _Recognitions_ it is the idea that certain doctrines are not to be idly taught , but can be had after a certain level of spiritual maturity is reached . Now one can approach this and other such evidence in many ways . I do n't intend that everyone interpret Christian history as I do , but I believe that evidence exists ( favorably interpreted , of course ) of early Christian rites analogous to those practiced by Mormons today . | Neither New Testament | Christianity nor Biblical Judaism made a secret of their practices . But if Judaism and Christianity had such ceremonies , would you expect to read about them in public documents ? One can search the Book of Mormon and other Mormon scripture and find almost no information on temple worship . Yes , you could establish that Mormons worship in temples , but you would probably be hard pressed to characterize that worship . On that basis , can we conclude that the Bible explains *all* practices which might have taken place , and that absence of such descriptions proves they did not exist ? Mormon scholar Dr. Hugh Nibley offers us a list of scriptures from which I have taken a few : 1 . `` It is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven , but to them it is not given '' ( Matt . 13:11 ) . 2 . `` All men can not receive this saying , save they to whom it is given '' ( Matt . 19:11 ) . 3 . `` I have yet many things to say unto you , but ye can not bear them now '' ( John 16:12 ) . 4 . `` The time cometh , when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs , but I shall shew you plainly of the Father '' ( John 16:25 ) . 5 . `` ... unspeakable words , which it is not lawful for a man to utter '' ( 1 Cor . 3:1-2 ) . 6 . `` Many things ... I would not write with paper and ink ; but I ... come unto you and speak face to face '' ( 2 Jn . 1:12 ) . ( Nibley , _Since Cumorah_ , pp . 92-94 ) Again , these can also be interpreted many different ways . I believe they serve to show that not all doctrines which could have been taught were actually taught openly . | I have heard that Joseph Smith took the entire | practice ( i.e . both the ritual and the secrecy surrounding the ritual ) | from the Freemasons . Anybody in the know have any authoritative | information on whether or not this claim is true ? Historically , Joseph Smith had been adiministering the temple endowment ceremony for nearly a year before joining the Freemasons . There is diary evidence which supports a claim that the rite did not change after Smith became a Mason . It can be argued that Smith had ample exposure to Masonic proceedings through the burlesque of his time and through his brother Hyrum ( a Mason ) , though no specific connection has yet been established . My conversations with Masons ( with respect to temple rite transcriptions which have appeared on the net ) have led me to believe that the connection from Masonry to Mormonism is fairly tenuous . As our moderator notes , most of what was similar was removed in the recent revisions to the temple ceremony . I believe that critics who charge that Mormon rites were lifted from Freemasonry do not have adequate knowledge of the rites in question . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Jay Windley * University of Utah * Salt Lake City jwindley @ asylum.cs.utah.edu -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

If we had backed him strongly early on I doubt there would be the problem there is now . Many Russians became disillusioned with democracy and reforms when they felt , rightly IMO , that the West did n't care . Yeltsin was virtually promised massive aid ( once Bush got over his Gorby-mania . ) This probably kept him from dismantling the congress and calling for new elections . Well , the aid did n't come through and we did n't make sure it went to the proper places and now the anti-reformers are gaining strength where before they were in hiding . > > Have you considered a non-interventionist policy ?

Perhaps voluntary gifts would work if we had the proper framework but we do not have it . We have to face the problem *now* , not in X years when we have a Libertarian dream society . Right now there are huge stumbling blocks to trade , let alone charity . There are still limitations to high-tech exports . NASA ca n't buy Proton launch vehicles from them . Sure , the market may be able to help a great deal but it ca n't right now . There are too many obstacles . Instead of fighting against the aid you should be fighting to tear down the obstacles the market and charities have to face . > > > Seriously .

I think *limited* government > is more key than how democratic it is . Well , I think limited government is primarily democratic due to it being limited . But the main question is how do you transform a state-run economy and monolithic government into something that even remotely looks like ours ? ( BTW , sometimes it seems that our government is trying to go the opposite direction ) It is not going to be painless and not going to be easy . We simply can not wait to help when they *have* the 'proper ' government . They 'll never get there without the aid . It may be too late already . > > > BTW , who is to decide 'stupid ?

For me there is a constant dynamic between my tendency to eat , which appears to be totally limitless , and the purely conscious desire to not put on too much weight . When I get too fat , I just diet/exercise more ( with varying degrees of success ) to take off the extra weight . Usually I cycle within a 15 lb range , but smaller and larger cycles occur as well . I 'm always afraid that this method will stop working someday , but usually I seem to be able to hold the weight gain in check . This is one reason I have a hard time accepting the notion of some metabolic derangement associated with cycle dieting ( that results in long-term weight gain ) . I have been cycle- dieting for at least 20 years without seeing such a change . I think a vigorous exercise program can go a long way toward keeping the cycles smaller and the baseline weight low .

Richard Hirschhaut , director of the San Francisco branch of the ADL , art dealer Roy Bullock and former policeman Tom Gerard were also named as defendants in the suit , filed in San Francisco County Superior Court . The 19 accuse the ADL of B'nai B'rith , a group dedicated to fighting anti-Semitism , and the other defendants of secretly gathering information on them , including data from state and federal agencies . The suit alleges they disclosed the information to others , including the governments of Israel and South Africa , in what it alleges was a `` a massive spying operation . '' The action is a class-action suit . It was filed on behalf of about 12,000 anti-apartheid activists or opponents of Israeli policies about whom the plaintiffs believe the ADL , Bullock and Gerard gathered information . Representatives of the ADL in San Francisco were not immediately available for comment on Wednesday . The civil suit is the first legal action arising out of allegations that Gerard , a former inspector in the San Francisco police intelligence unit , passed confidential police files on California political activists to a spy ring . The FBI and San Francisco police are investigating the ADL , Bullock and Gerard over the affair and last week searched the ADL 's offices in San Francisco and Los Angeles . The suit alleges invasion of privacy under the Civil Code of California , which prohibits the publication of information obtained from official sources . It seeks exemplary damages of at least $ 2,500 per person as well as other unspecified damages . Lawyer Pete McCloskey , a former Congresmen who is representing the plaintiffs , said the 19 plaintiffs included Arab-Americans and Jews -- and his wife Helen , who also had information gathered about her . One of the plaintiffs is Yigal Arens , a research scientist at the University of Southern California who is a son of the former Israeli Defence Minister . Arens told the San Francisco Examiner he had seen a file the ADL kept on him in the 1980s , presumably because of his criticism of the treatment of Palestinians and his position on the Israeli-occupied territories . According to court documents released last week , Bullock and Gerard both kept information on thousands of California political activists . In the documents , a police investigator said he believed the ADL paid Bullock for many years to provide information and that both the league and Bullock received confidential information from the authorities . No criminal charges have yet been filed in the case . The ADL , Bullock and Gerard have all denied any wrongdoing . REUTER AC KG CM APn 04/14 2202 ADL Lawsuit Copyright , 1993 . The Associated Press . All rights reserved . By CATALINA ORTIZ Associated Press Writer SAN FRANCISCO ( AP ) -- Arab-Americans and critics of Israel sued the Anti-Defamation League on Wednesday , saying it invaded their privacy by illegally gathering information about them through a nationwide spy network . The ADL , a national group dedicated to fighting anti-Semitism , intended to use the data to discredit them because of their political views , according to the class-action lawsuit filed in San Francisco Superior Court . `` None of us has been guilty of racism or Nazism or anti-Semitism or hate crimes , or any of the other ` isms ' that the ADL claims to protect against . None of us is violent or criminal in any way , '' said Carol El-Shaieb , an education consultant who develops programs on Arab culture . The 19 plaintiffs include Yigal Arens , son of former Israel Defense Minister Moshe Arens . The younger Arens , a research scientist at the University of Southern California , said the ADL kept a file on him in the 1980s presumably because he has criticized Israel 's treatment of Palestinians . `` The ADL believes that anyone who is an Arab American ... or speaks politically against Israel is at least a closet anti-Semite , '' Arens said . The ADL has denied any wrongdoing , but could n't comment on the lawsuit because it has n't reviewed it , said a spokesman at the ADL 's New York headquarters . The FBI and local police and prosecutors are investigating allegations that the ADL spied on thousands of individuals and hundreds of groups , including white supremacist and anti-Semitic organizations , Arab-Americans , Greenpeace , the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and San Francisco public television station KQED . Some information allegedly came from confidential police and government records , according to court documents filed in the probe and the civil lawsuit . No charges have been filed in the criminal investigation . The lawsuit accuses the ADL of violating California 's privacy law , which forbids the intentional disclosure of personal information `` not otherwise public '' from state or federal records . The lawsuit claims the ADL disclosed the information to `` persons and entities '' who had no compelling need to receive it . It did n't elaborate . Defendants include Richard Hirschhaut , director of the ADL 's office in San Francisco . He did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment . Other defendants are San Francisco art dealer Roy Bullock , an alleged ADL informant over the past four decades , and former police officer Tom Gerard . Gerard allegedly tapped into law enforcement and government computers and passed information on to Bullock . Gerard , who has retired from the police force , has moved to the Philippines . Bullock 's lawyer , Richard Breakstone , said he could not comment on the lawsuit because he had not yet studied it . UPwe 04/14 1956 ADL sued for allegedly spying on U.S. residents SAN FRANCISCO ( UPI ) -- A group of California residents filed suit Wednesday charging the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai Brith with violating their privacy by spying on them for the Israeli and South African governments . The class-action suit , filed in San Francisco Superior Court , charges the ADL and its leadership conspired with a local police official to obtain information on outspoken opponents of Israeli policies towards the Occupied Territories and South Africa 's apartheid policy . The ADL refused to comment on the suit . The suit also took aim at two top local ADL officials and retired San Francicso police officer Tom Gerard , claiming they violated privacy guarantees in the state constitution and violated state confidentiality laws . According to the suit , Gerard helped the ADL obtain access to confidential files in law enforcement and government computers . Information from these files were passed to the foreign governments , the suit charges . `` The whole concept of an organized collection of information based on political viewpoints and using government agencies as a source of information is absolutely repugnant , '' said former Rep. Pete McCloskey , who is representing the plaintiffs . The ADL 's information-gathering network was revealed publicly last week when the San Francisco District Attorney 's Office released documents indicating the group had spied on 12,000 people and 500 political and ethnic groups for more than 30 years . `` My understanding is that they ( the ADL ) consider all activity that is in some sense opposed to Israel or Israeli action to be part of their responsbility to investigate , '' said Arens , a research scientist at the University of Southern California . `` The ADL believes that anyone who is Arab American ... or speaks politically against Israel is at least a closet anti-Semite . '' The FBI and the District Attorney 's Office have been investigating the operation for four months . The 19 plaintiffs in the case include Arens , the son of former Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Arens . In a press release , the plaintiffs said the alleged spying had damaged them psychologically and economically and accused the ADL of trying to interfere with their freedom of speech .

The parallels between Koresh and Joseph Smith are striking . # ^^^^^^^^^^^^ By `` they , '' you mean the leaders of the lds church ? I grant you that when Joseph Smith was still alive , plenty of `` accusations '' were filed , most of which had little bearing with reality , as evidenced by various verdicts . I have studied lds history for 15 years now , and I have yet to see prove that the lds leadership was involved , in quote : `` illegal activities . '' Plural marriage , yes , but your charge of `` underage '' wives sounds like it could have originated from a tabloid , and discredits the high moral standards which characterized these leaders and families , unlike , as it appears , those of David Koresh . # Joseph Smith started the sect . After he and his brother Hyram # were murdered in a Nauvoo , Il . jail cell , church membership split over # who to follow . Initially , Smith was considered a prophet ( just like # Mohammed , a rather interesting parallel considering Muslims consider # Christ to be a prophet the same as Jews , I 'm led to understand . Make # no mistake , this was no messiah we 're talking about in Smith ) . The And neither did he claim he was . As the church reflects the moral aptitude of its leaders ( and especially those of Joseph Smith ) , I have nothing but the highest respect for this inspired man , whose only `` crime '' was that he refused to deny that he had seen a vision ... Many have tried to explain the `` Smith phenomenon '' away , but the bold presence of an 8.5 million member strong church stands as a witness that Joseph Smith's testimony had enough resilience and power to carry on the message . # thought at the time was that the gift of prophecy was to be handed # down father to son . After Joseph Smith died , his son was only # entering his teens . Brigham Young and a few others claimed to have # been bequeathed the gift and leadership prior to his death . The # Council of Twelve , the Church governing body , was n't of much help # here , and this basic conflict is still a wedge between the sects . # Brigham Young took his followers to Salt Lake . The rest waited # for Smith Jr. to grow up enough to assume leadership . The other # claimants to the leadership were soon ignored , like Mike Dukakis . ; - ) '' The rest '' were apostates and excommunicated members of the Church , while the great majority of the membership , the Twelve , and the various auxiliary organizations , chose to accept Brigham Young as the new prophet and leader of the Church . If you knew your lds scriptures and doctrine , you would have known that Brigham Young was the FIRST in line to fill the prophet Joseph Smith 's vacancy : he was the senior apostle in the Quorum , and various comments made by Joseph indicated that it was Brigham who would lead the latter-day exodus to the West . Other rightful `` heirs '' were either dead ( Hyrum Smith ) or excommunicated ( Oliver Cowdery ) , and while persecutions abounded and intensified , Joseph Smith had already given orders to look for a new place , an empty land beyond the boundaries of the United States ( at that time ) . This '' Rekhabite '' principle ( pseudographia ) was well understood and antipated by the great majority of lds faithful , and was not questioned by them . Granted , a couple of `` do-it-yourselfers '' stayed behind , unwilling to sacrifice and to undertake the perilous journey to the unknown , but this also was necessary to separate the tares from the wheat . The church benefitted from this purification process : they became even more unified and willing to carry out their mission to the world . # Both sects practiced the `` 1-year food stockpile '' doctrine , # and this being frontier and farming country most carried or at # least owned weapons . There is little evidence that they were a # militaristic sect , given that they tended to move on rather than # face large-scale opposition . Brigham Young , having suffered a # great deal getting to Salt Lake , seems to have been quite # justified in making military training a good thing . Remember , # this was far beyond where even the US Army went , and these people # had nobody to turn to save themselves . # # Just a little context to put this all in perspective . BTW , since when is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ( one of the largest denominations in the country ) a `` sect '' ? ? ? It did n't `` splinter '' from any other religion , as did say , the Southern Baptists or Methodists . # > So what did the Mormons get ? It seems that J. Edgar Hoover was very # > impressed with the way they kept secrets . ( They 're pledged to defend # > secrets with their lives and atone for sin with blood . Many actually # > do - even to the point of suicide . ) What a balloney . Suicide is sinful and against the law of God . I am not comfortable with this alleged `` cosiness '' with Mammon : I assure you that *many* among us reject this attitude categorically . Period . Our ONLY true allegiance is to our God and to the leaders which He has appointed to represent Him . In any regard , to read this TRASH ( about suicide and `` atone for sins with blood '' ) is yet another insulting misrepresentation of what my church believes in and stands for ... # # The RLDS , the Reorganized LDS , are friendly rivals of the LDS # and delight in telling stories about them , which generates quick retorts # from the LDS members and everybody has a grand time . At no time have # I ever even heard this hinted at . I 'm taking it with a salt block .

Preposterous . Even if this were true ( reliable data , please ) , I am convinced that those officers would perform to the highest codes of honor and conduct ( that 's why they were selected for in the first place , remember ? ) . Besides , one of our Articles of Faith STRONGLY states the principle of freedom of religion , and that all people are free to worship `` *how* , *where* , or *what* they may . '' # If it 's true , there would be little affect . LDS and RLDS # philosophy is that all other religions have strayed from the true # Church as set down by Jesus , but that God will judge each on his # own merits . In addition , the RLDS also contend ( and the LDS may # as well ) that ignorance of the True Way ( tm ) is an excuse . You # can only be condemned if you had been tought the way and rejected # it . In short , LDS and RLDS suffer everybody from Lutherans to # Buddhists , secure in the knowledge that though they are wrong they # will not be penalized for ignorance . It is more likely that Hoover # liked them because of their rather strict upbringings which forbade # alcohol , tobacco , hot drink ( like coffee or tea ) , and the like . # These people are the `` salt of the Earth '' and as such are more # easily made to follow orders and have few vices to be used against them . A good explanation , I can accept that .

Papazian asserted in 'Patriotism Perverted ' that the Armenians 'lean toward Fascism and Hitlerism . ' [ 1 ] At that time , he could not have foreseen that the Armenians would actively assume a pro-German stance and even collaborate in World War II . His book was dealing with the Armenian genocide of Turkish population of eastern Anatolia . However , extreme rightwing ideological tendencies could be observed within the Dashnagtzoutune long before the outbreak of the Second World War . In 1936 , for example , O. Zarmooni of the 'Tzeghagrons ' was quoted in the 'Hairenik Weekly : ' '' The race is force : it is treasure . If we follow history we shall see that races , due to their innate force , have created the nations and these have been secure only insofar as they have reverted to the race after becoming a nation . Today Germany and Italy are strong because as nations they live and breath in terms of race . On the other hand , Russia is comparatively weak because she is bereft of social sanctities . `` [ 2 ] [ 1 ] K. S. Papazian , 'Patriotism Perverted , ' ( Boston , Baikar Press 1934 ) , Preface .

Well , some quick math on my part shows that an 8.3MHz bus , 16 bits wide , performing a transfer every two clock cycles will provide 8.3M bytes/sec . Someone said that it really takes 3 clock cycles to perform a transfer , so that reduces the transfer rate to 5.5MB/s , which is the commonly-used figure for ISA bus speed .

It is best to do nothing , besides taking some pain medication initially . Some patients do n't like this and expect , or demand , to have something done . In these cases some physicians will `` tape '' the patient ( put a lot of heavy adhesive tape around the chest ) , or prescribe an elastic binder .

Yes , but also many people who are not trying to make government recognize Christianity as the dominant religion in this country do no think the motto infringes upon the rights of others who do not share their beliefs .

I have access to the Apple Employee discount ( I work for one of Apple 's spinoffs ) , so I can get these reasonably cheaply . I 've heard bad things about the LS ; comments ? I 'm leaning towards the Personal NTR , cause it has a nice small footprint . - LaserWriter Select 300 . I hear it does n't have PostScript , but I haven't seen anything for sure . I heard mumbles once about a `` postscript upgrade . '' ? ? - Used HP LaserJets . I 've worked with the II and IIP on another platform , and they were *painfully* slow . Are they that bad on the mac ? - I 've seen ads for an Epson PS laserprinter that is running quite cheap . Any comments on this printer ?

I know no fixed version of the 6551 . There are different possibilities to work around this bug . The easiest is to tie _CTS to GND and use _DSR or _DCD as _CTS . It should be easy to fix the software , _DSR is bit 6 and DCD ist bit 5 of the Status Register ( Read 6551 with RS1 = low and RS0 = high ) . Using the _CTS-line can lead into big trouble .

A good GM ( like Murray ) can I think Murray has done a great job . He 's picked up Ciccarelli , Sheppard , Ysebaert , Howe , Coffey , and Riendeau ( plus some depth players ) without giving up anything the Wings needed or any of his top prospects . All of this in three years . Has anyone done better ? The year before he took over , the Wings did n't even make the playoffs . There was about a year and a half during Demers ' stint that the Wings did OK , but that was due to Demers ' motavational skills and clutch and grab style . They did n't have much talent . Gerald , Murray was n't responsible for Primeau ( although I 'm not ready to admit that 's a horrible pick ) . They hired him after the draft ( which has never made sense to me ) . His first pick was Lapointe . Ron ********** '' And one of my major goals is to leave the next president a new set of things to worry about .

Question : If a team uses 40 players in a season do you merely divide the total +/- by 40 ?

It 's not really their _decision_ to be tried . The rulings _do_ have legal consequences , but only in Islamic law and not in UK law ( this should be obvious ) .

Born 1959 Teacher Sumgait Secondary School No . 10 Secretary of the Komsomol Organization at School No . 10 Member of the Sumgait City Komsomol Committee Office Resident at Building 17/33B , Apartment 15 Microdistrict No . 3 Sumgait [ Azerbaijan ] [ Note : The events in Kafan , used as a pretext to attack Armenians in Azerbaijan are false , as verified by independent International Human Rights organizations - DD ] I 'm thinking about the price the Sumgait Armenians paid to be living in Armenia now . We paid for it in human casualties and crippled fates -- the price was too great ! Now , after the Sumgait tragedy , we , the victims , divide our lives into `` before '' and `` after . '' We talk like that : that was before the war . Like the people who went through World War II and considered it a whole epoch , a fate . No matter how many years go by , no matter how long we live , it will never be forgotten . On the contrary , some of the moments become even sharper : in our rage , in our sorrow , we saw everything differently , but now . . . They say that you can see more with distance , and we can see those inhuman events with more clarity now . . . we more acutely perceive our losses and everything that happened . Nineteen eighty-eight was a leap year . Everyone fears a leap year and wants it to pass as quickly as possible . Yet we never thought that that leap year would be such a black one for every Sumgait Armenian : those who lost someone and those who did n't . That second to last day of winter was ordinary for our family , although you could already smell danger in the air . But we did n't think that the danger was near and possible , so we did n't take any steps to save ourselves . At least , as my parents say , at least we should have done something to save the children . My parents themselves are not that old , 52 and 53 years . But then they thought that they had already lived enough , and did everything they could to save us . In our apartment the tragedy started on February 28 , around five in the afternoon . I call it a tragedy , and I repeat : it was a tragedy even though all our family survived . When I recall how they broke down our door my skin crawls ; even now , among Armenians , among people who wish me only well , I feel like it 's all starting over again . I remember how that mob broke into our apartment . . . My parents were standing in the hall . My father had an axe in his hands and had immediately locked both of the doors . Our door was rarely locked since friends and neighbors often dropped by . We 're known as a hospitable family , and we just never really thought about whether the people who were coming to see us were Azerbaijanis , Jews , or Russians . We had friends of many nationalities , even a Turkmen woman . My parents were in the hall , my father with an axe . I remember him telling my mother , `` Run to the kitchen for a knife . '' But Mother was detached , pale , as though she had decided to sell her life a bit dearer . To be honest I never expected it of her , she 's afraid of getting shot and afraid of the dark . A girlfriend was at the house that day , a Russian girl , Lyuda , and Mamma said , '' No matter what happens , no matter what they do to us , you 're not to come out of the bedroom . We 're going to tell them that we 're alone in the apartment . '' We went into the bedroom . There were four of us . Marina and the Russian girl crawled under the bed , and we covered them up with a rug , boxes of dishes , and Karina and I are standing there and looking at one another . The idea that perhaps we were seeing each other for the last time flashed somewhere inside me . I 'm an emotional person and I express my emotions immediately . I wanted to embrace her and kiss her , as though it were the last second . And maybe Karina was thinking the same thing , but she 's quite reserved . We did n't have time to say anything to each other because we immediately heard Mamma raise a shout . There was so much noise from the tramping of feet , from the shouting , and from excited voices . I could n't figure what was going on out there because the door to the bedroom was only open a crack . But when Mamma shouted the second time Karina ran out of the bedroom . I ran after her , I had wanted to hold her back , but when she opened the door and ran out into the hall they saw us immediately . The only thing I managed to do was close the door behind me , at least so as to save Marina and her friend . The mob was shouting , all of their eyes were shining , all red , like from insomnia . At first about 40 people burst in , but later I was standing with my back to the door and could n't see . They came into the hall , into the kitchen , and dragged my father into the other room . He did n't utter a word , he just raised the axe to hit them , but Mamma snatched the axe from behind and said , `` Tell them not to touch the children . Tell them they can do as they want with us , but not to harm the children . '' She said this to Father in Armenian . There were Azerbaijanis from Armenia among the mob who broke in . They understood Armenian perfectly . The local Azerbaijanis do n't know Armenian , they do n't need to speak it . And one of them responded in Armenian : `` You and your children both . . . we 're going to do the same thing to you and your children that you Armenians did in Kafan . They killed our women , our girls , our mothers , they cut their breasts off , and burned our houses . . . , '' and so on and so forth , `` and we came to do the same thing to you . '' This whole time some of them are destroying the house and the others are shouting at us . They were mostly young people , under 30 . At first there were n't any older people among them . And all of their faces were unfamiliar . Sumgait is a small town , all the same , and we know a lot of people by their faces , especially me , I 'm a teacher . So they dragged my father into the other room . They twisted his arms and took him in there , no they did n't take him in there , they dragged him in there , because he was already unable to walk . They closed the door to that room all but a crack . We could n't see what was happening to Father , what they were doing to him . Then a young man , about 26 years old , started to tear off Mamma 's sarafan , and Mamma shouted at him in Azerbaijani : `` I 'm old enough to be your mother ! What are you doing ? ! '' He struck her . Now he 's being held , Mamma identified him . I hope he 's convicted . Then they went after Karina , who 's been talking to them like a Komsomol leader , as though she were trying to lead them down a different path , as they say , to influence their consciousness . She told them that what they were doing was wrong , that they must n't do it . She said , `` Come on , let 's straighten this out , without emotions . What do you want ? Who are you ? Why did you come here ? What did we ever do to you ? '' Someone tried to explain who they were and why they had come into our home , but then the ones in the back -- more of them kept coming and coming -- said , `` What are you talking to , them for . You should kill them . We came here to kill them . '' They pushed Karina , struck her , and she fell down . They beat her , but she did n't cry out . Even when they tore her clothes off , she kept repeating , `` What did we do to you ? What did we do to you ? '' And even later , when she came to , she said , `` Mamma , what did we do to them ? Why did they do that to us ? '' That group was prepared , I know this because I noticed that some of them only broke up furniture , and others only dealt with us . I remember that when they were beating me , when they were tearing my clothes off , I felt neither pain nor shame because my entire attention was riveted to Karina . All I could do was watch how much they beat her and how painful it was for her , and what they did to her . That 's why I felt no pain . Later , when they carried Karina off , they beat her savagely . . . It 's really amazing that she not only lived , but did n't lose her mind . She is very beautiful and they did everything they could to destroy her beauty . Mostly they beat her face , with their fists , kicking her , using anything they could find . Mamma , Karina , and I were all in one room . And again I did n't feel any pain , just did n't feel any , no matter how much they beat me , no matter what they did . Then one of those creeps said that there was n't enough room in the apartment . They broke up the beds and the desk and moved everything into the corners so there would be more room . Then someone suggested , `` Let 's take her outside . '' Those beasts were in Heaven . They did what they would do every day if they were n't afraid of the authorities . Those were their true colors . At the time I thought that in fact they would always behave that way if they were n't afraid of what would happen to them . When they carried Karina out and beat Mamma-her face was completely covered with blood -- that 's when I started to feel the pain . I blacked out several times from the pain , but each moment that I had my eyes open it was as though I were recording it all on film . I think I 'm a kind person by nature , but I 'm vengeful , especially if someone is mean to me , and I do n't deserve it . I hold a grudge a long time if someone intentionally causes me pain . And every time I would come to and see one of those animals on top of me , I 'd remember them , and I 'll remember them for the rest of my life , even though people tell me '' forget , '' you have to forget , you have to go on living . At some point I remember that they stood me up and told me something , and despite the fact that I hurt all over -- I had been beaten terribly -- I found the strength in myself to interfere with their tortures . I realized that I had to do something : resist them or just let them kill me to bring my suffering to an end . I pushed one of them away , he was a real horse . I remember now that he 's being held , too . As though they were all waiting for it , they seized me and took me out onto the balcony . I had long hair , and it was stuck all over me . One of the veranda shutters to the balcony was open , and I realized that they planned to throw me out the window , because they had already picked me up with their hands , I was up in the air . As though for the last time I took a really deep breath and closed my eyes , and somehow braced myself inside , I suddenly became cold , as though my heart had sunk into my feet . And suddenly I felt myself flying . I could n't figure out if I was really flying or if I just imagined it . When I came to I thought now I 'm going to smash on the ground . And when it did n't happen I opened my eyes and realized that I was still lying on the floor . And since I did n't scream , did n't beg them at all , they became all the more wild , like wolves . They started to trample me with their feet . Shoes with heels on them , and iron horseshoes , like they had spe- cially put them on . Then I lost consciousness . I came to a couple of times and waited for death , summoned it , beseeched it . Some people ask for good health , life , happiness , but at that moment I did n't need any of those things . I was sure that none of us would survive , and I had even forgotten about Marina ; and if none of us was alive , it was n't worth living . There was a moment when the pain was especially great . I withstood inhuman pain , and realized that they were going to torment me for a long time to come because I had showed myself to be so tenacious . I started to strangle myself , and when I started to wheeze they realized that with my death I was going to put an end to their pleasures , and they pulled my hands from my throat . The person who injured and insulted me most painfully I remember him very well , because he was the oldest in the group . He looked around 48 . I know that he has four children and that he considers himself an ideal father and person , one who would never do such a thing . Something came over him then , you see , even during the investigation he almost called me `` daughter , '' he apologized , although , of course , he knew that I 'd never forgive him . Something like that I can never forgive . I have never injured anyone with my behavior , with my words , or with my deeds , I have always put myself in the other person 's shoes , but then , in a matter of hours , they trampled me entirely . I shall never forget it . I wanted to do myself in then , because I had nothing to lose , because no one could protect me . My father , who tried to do something against that hoard of beasts by himself , could do nothing and would n't be able to do anything . I knew that I was even sure that he was no longer alive . And Ira Melkumian , my acquaintance I knew her and had been to see her family a couple of times -- her brother tried to save her and could n't , so he tried to kill her , his very own sister . He threw an axe at her to kill her and put an end to her suffering . When they stripped her clothes off and carried her into the other room , her brother knew what awaited her . I do n't know which one it was , Edik or Igor . Both of them were in the room from which the axe was thrown . But the axe hit one of the people carrying her and so they killed her and made her death even more excruciating , maybe the most excruciating of all the deaths of those days in Sumgait . I heard about it all from the neighbor from the Melkumians ' landing . His name is Makhaddin , he knows my family a little . He came to see how we had gotten settled in the new apartment in Baku , how we were feeling , and if we needed anything . He 's a good person . He said , '' You should praise God that you all survived . But what I saw with my own eyes , I , a man , who has seen so many people die , who has lived a whole life , I , '' he says , `` nearly lost my mind that day . I had never seen the likes of it and think I never shall again . '' The door to his apartment was open and he saw everything . One of the brothers threw the axe , because they had already taken the father and mother out of the apartment . Igor , Edik , and Ira remained . He saw Ira , naked , being carried into the other room in the hands of six or seven people . He told us about it and said he would never forget it . He heard the brothers shouting something , inarticulate from pain , rage , and the fact that they were powerless to do anything . But all the same they tried to do something . The guy who got hit with the axe lived . I I After I had been unsuccessful at killing myself I saw them taking Marina and Lyuda out of the bedroom . I was in such a state that I could n't even remember my sister 's name . I wanted to cry `` Marina ! '' out to her , but could not . I looked at her and knew that it was a familiar , dear face , but couldn't for the life of me remember what her name was and who she was . And thus I saved her , because when they were taking her out , she , as it turns out , had told them that she had just been visiting and that she and Lyuda were both there by chance , that they were n't Armenians . Lyuda 's a Russian , you can tell right away , and Marina speaks Azerbaijani wonderfully and she told them that she was an Azerbaijani . And I almost gave her away and doomed her . I 'm glad that at least Marina came out of this all in good physical health . . . although her spirit was murdered . . . At some point I came to and saw Igor , Igor Agayev , my acquaintance , in that mob . He lives in the neighboring building . For some reason I remembered his name , maybe I sensed my defense in him . I called out to him in Russian , `` Igor , help ! '' But he turned away and went into the bedroom . Just then they were taking Marina and Lyuda out of the bedroom . Igor said he knew Marina and Lyuda , that Marina in fact was Azerbaijani , and he took both of them to the neighbors . And the idea stole through me that maybe Igor had led them to our apartment , something like that , but if he was my friend , he was supposed to save me . Then they were striking me very hard -- we have an Indian vase , a metal one , they were hitting me on the back with it and I blacked out -- they took me out onto the balcony a second time to throw me out the window . They were already sure that I was dead because I did n't react at all to the new blows . Someone said , `` She 's already dead , let 's throw her out . '' When they carried me out onto the balcony for the second time , when I was about to die the second time , I heard someone say in Azerbaijani : `` Do n't kill her , I know her , she 's a teacher . '' I can still hear that voice ringing in my ears , but I ca n't remember whose voice it was . It was n't Igor , because he speaks Azerbaijani with an accent : his mother is Russian and they speak Russian at home . He speaks Azerbaijani worse than our Marina does . I remember when they carried me in and threw me on the bed he came up to me , that person , and I having opened my eyes , saw and recognized that person , but immediately passed out cold . I had been beaten so much that I did n't have the strength to remember him . I only remember that this person was older and he had a high position . Unfortunately I ca n't remember anything more . What should I say about Igor ? He did n't treat me badly . I had heard a lot about him , that he was n't that good a person , that he sometimes drank too much . Once he boasted to me that he had served in Afghanistan . He knew that women usually like bravery in a man . Especially if a man was in Afghanistan , if he was wounded , then it 's about eighty percent sure that he will be treated very sympathetically , with respect . Later I found out that he had served in Ufa , and was injured , but that 's not in Afghanistan , of course . I found that all out later . Among the people who were in our apartment , my Karina also saw the Secretary of the Party organization . I do n't know his last name , his first name is Najaf , he is an Armenian-born Azerbaijani . But later Karina was n't so sure , she was no longer a hundred percent sure that it was he she saw , and she did n't want to endanger him . She said , `` He was there , '' and a little while later , `` Maybe they beat me so much that I am confusing him with someone else . No , it seems like it was he . '' I am sure it was he because when he came to see us the first time he said one thing , and the next time he said something entirely different . The investigators have n't summoned him yet . He came to see us in the Khimik boarding house where we were living at the time . He brought groceries and flowers , this was right before March 8th ; he almost started crying , he was so upset to see our condition . I do n't know if he was putting us on or not , but later , after we had told the investigator and they summoned him to the Procuracy , he said that he had been in Baku , he was n't in Sumgait . The fact that he changed his testimony leads me to believe that Karina is right , that in fact it was he who was in our apartment . I do n't know how the investigators are now treating him . At one point I wondered and asked , and was told that he had an alibi and was not in our apartment . Could n't he have gone to Baku and arranged an alibi ? I 'm not ruling out that possibility . Ill now return to our apartment . Mamma had come to . You could say that she bought them off with the gold Father gave her when they were married : her wedding band and her watch were gold . She bought her own and her husband 's lives with them . She gave the gold to a 14-year old boy . Vadim Vorobyev . A Russian boy , he speaks Azerbaijani perfectly . He 's an orphan who was raised by his grandfather and who lives in Sumgait on Nizami Street . He goes to a special school , one for mentally handicapped children . But I 'll say this -- I 'm a teacher all the same and in a matter of minutes I can form an opinion -- that boy is not at all mentally handicapped . He 's healthy , he can think just fine , and analyze , too . . . policemen should be so lucky . And he 's cunning , too . After that he went home and tore all of the pictures out of his photo album . He beat Mamma and demanded gold , saying , `` Lady , if you give us all the gold and money in your apartment we 'll let you live . '' And Mamma told them where the gold was . He brought in the bag and opened it , shook out the contents , and everyone who was in the apartment jumped on it , started knocking each other over and taking the gold from one another . I 'm surprised they did n't kill one another right then . Mamma was still in control of herself . She had been beaten up , her face was black and blue from the blows , and her eyes were filled with blood , and she ran into the other room . Father was lying there , tied up , with a gag in his mouth and a pillow over his face . There was a broken table on top of the pil- low . Mamma grabbed Father and he could n't walk ; like me , he was half dead , halfway into the other world . He could n't comprehend anything , could n't see , and was covered with black and blue . Mamma pulled the gag out of his mouth , it was some sort of cloth , I think it was a slipcover from an armchair . The bandits were still in our apartment , even in the room Mamma pulled Father out of , led him out of , carried him out of . We had two armchairs in that room , a small magazine table , a couch , a television , and a screen . Three people were standing next to that screen , and into their shirts , their pants , everywhere imaginable , they were shoving shot glasses and cups from the coffee service -- Mamma saw them out of the corner of her eye . She said , `` I was afraid to turn around , I just seized Father and started pulling him , but at the threshold I could n't hold him up , he fell down , and I picked him up again and dragged him down the stairs to the neighbors ' . '' Mamma remembered one of the criminals , the one who had watched her with his face half-turned toward her , out of one eye . She says , `` I realized that my death would come from that person . I looked him in the eyes and he recoiled from fear and went stealing . '' Later they caught that scoundrel . Meanwhile , Mamma grabbed Father and left . I was alone . Igor had taken Marina away , Mamma and Father were gone , Karina was already outside , I did n't know what they were doing to her . I was left all alone , and at that moment . . . I became someone else , do you understand ? Even though I knew that neither Mother and Father in the other room , nor Marina and Lyuda under the bed could save me , all the same I somehow managed to hold out . I went on fighting them , I bit someone , I remember , and I scratched another . But when I was left alone I realized what kind of people they were , the ones I had observed , the ones who beat Karina , what kind of people they were , the ones who beat me , that it was all unnecessary , that I was about to die and that all of that would die with me . At some point I took heart when I saw the young man from the next building . I did n't know his name , but we would greet one another when we met , we knew that we were from the same microdistrict . When I saw him I said , `` Neighbor , is that you ? '' In so doing I placed myself in great danger . He realized that if I lived I would remember him . That 's when he grabbed the axe . The axe that had been taken from my father . I automatically fell to my knees and raised my hands to take the blow of the axe , although at the time it would have been better if he had struck me in the head with the axe and put me out of my misery . When he started getting ready to wind back for the blow , someone came into the room . The newcomer had such an impact on everyone that my neighbor 's axe froze in the air . Everyone stood at attention for this guy , like soldiers in the presence of a general . Everyone waited for his word : continue the atrocities or not . He said , `` Enough , let 's go to the third entryway . '' In the third entryway they killed Uncle Shurik , Aleksandr Gambarian . This confirms once again that they had prepared in advance . Almost all of them left with him , as they went picking up pillows , blankets , whatever they needed , whatever they found , all the way up to worn out slippers and one boot , someone else had already taken the other . Four people remained in the room , soldiers who did n't obey their general . They had to have come recently , because other faces had flashed in front of me over those 2 to 3 hours , but I had never seen those three . One of them , Kuliyev ( I identified him later ) , a native of the Sisian District of Armenia , an Azerbaijani , had moved to Azerbaijan a year before . He told me in Armenian : '' Sister , do n't be afraid , I 'll drive those three Azerbaijanis out of here . '' That 's just what he said , `` those Azerbaijanis , '' as though he himself were not Azerbaijani , but some other nationality , he said with such hatred , `` I 'll drive them out of here now , and you put your clothes on , and find a hammer and nails and nail the door shut , because they 'll be coming back from Apartment 41 . '' That 's when I found out that they had gone to Apartment 41 . Before that , the person in the Eskimo dogskin coat , the one who came in and whom they listened to , the `` general , '' said that they were going to the third entryway . Kuliyev helped me get some clothes on , because l could n't do it by myself . Marina 's old fur coat was lying on the floor . He threw it over my shoulders , I was racked with shivers , and he asked where he could find nails and a hammer . He wanted to give them to me so that when he left I could nail the door shut . But the door was lying on the floor in the hall . I went out onto the balcony . There were broken windows , and flowers and dirt from flowerpots were scattered on the floor . It was impossible to find anything . He told me , `` Well , fine , I wo n't leave you here . Would any of the neighbors let you in ? They 'll be back , they wo n't calm down , they know you 're alive . '' He told me all this in Armenian . Then he returned to the others and said , `` What are you waiting for ? Leave ! '' They said , `` Ah , you just want to chase us out of here and do it with her yourself . No , we want to do it to . '' He urged them on , but gently , not coarsely , because he was alone against them , although they were still just boys , not old enough to be drafted . He led them out of the room , and went down to the third floor with them himself , and said , `` Leave . What 's the mat- ter , are n't you men ? Go fight with the men . What do you want of her ? '' And he came back upstairs . They wanted to come up after him and he realized that he could n't hold them off forever . Then he asked me where he could hide me . I told him at the neighbors ' on the fourth floor , Apartment 10 , we were on really good terms with them . We knocked on the door , and he explained in Azerbaijani . The neighbor woman opened the door and immediately said , `` I 'm an Azerbaijani . '' He said , `` I know . Let her sit at your place a while . Do n't open the door to anyone , no one knows about this , I wo n't tell anyone . Let her stay at your place . '' She says , `` Fine , have her come in . '' I went in . She cried a bit and gave me some stockings , I had gone entirely numb and was racked with nervous shudders . I burst into tears . Even though I was wearing Marina 's old fur coat , it 's a short one , a half-length , I was cold all the same . I asked , `` Do you know where my family is , what happened to them ? '' She says , `` No , I do n't know anything . I 'm afraid to go out of the apartment , now they 're so wild that they do n't look to see who 's Azerbaijani and who 's Armenian . '' Kuliyev left . Ten minutes later my neighbor says , `` You know , Lyuda , I do n't want to lose my life because of you , or my son and his wife . Go stay with someone else . '' During the butchery in our apartment one of the scum , a sadist , took my earring in his mouth -- I had pearl earrings on -- and ripped it out , tearing the earlobe . The other earring was still there . When I 'm nervous I fix my hair constantly , and then , when I touched my ear , I noticed that I had one earring on . I took it out and gave it to her . She took the earring , but she led me out of the apartment . I went out and did n't know where to go . I heard someone going upstairs . I do n't know who it was but assumed it was them . With tremendous difficulty I end up to our apartment , I wanted to die in my own home . I go into the apartment and hear that they are coming up to our place , to the fifth floor . I had to do something . I went into the bedroom where Marina and Lyuda had hidden and saw that the bed was overturned . Instead of hiding I squatted near some broken Christmas ornaments , found an unbroken one , and started sobbing . Then they came in . Someone said that there were still some things to take . I think that someone pushed me under the bed . I lay on the floor , and there were broken ornaments on it , under my head and legs . I got all cut up , but I lay there without moving . My heart was beating so hard it seemed the whole town could hear it . There were no lights on . Maybe that 's what saved me . They were burning matches , and toward the end they brought in a candle . They started picking out the clothes that could still be worn . They took Father 's sport jacket and a bedspread , the end of which was under my head . They pulled on the one end , and it felt like they were pulling my hair out . I almost cried out . And again I realized I was n't getting out of there alive , and I started to strangle myself again . I took my throat in one hand , and pressed the other on my mouth , so as not to wheeze , so that I would die and they would only find me afterward . They were throwing the burned matches under the bed , and I got burned , but I withstood it . Something inside of me held on , someone 's hand was protecting me to the end . I knew that I was going to die , but I did n't know how . I knew that if I survived I would walk out of that apartment , but if I found out that one of my family had died , I would die for sure , because I had never been so close to death and could n't imagine how you could go on living without your mother or father , or without your sister . Marina , I thought , was still alive : she went to Lyuda 's place or someone is hiding her . I tried to think that Igor would n't let them be killed . He served in Afghanistan , he should protect her . While I was strangling myself I said my good-byes to everyone . And then I thought , how could Marina survive alone . If they killed all of us , how would she live all by herself ? There were six people in the room . They talked among themselves and smoked . One talked about his daughter , saying that there was no children 's footwear in our apartment that he could take for his daughter . Another said that he liked the apartment -- recently we had done a really good job fixing everything up -- and that he would live there after everything was all over . They started to argue . A third one says , `` How come you get it ? I have four children , and there are three rooms here , that 's just what I need . All these years I 've been living in God-awful places . '' Another one says , '' Neither of you gets it . We 'll set fire to it and leave . '' Then someone said that Azerbaijanis live right next door , the fire could move over to their place . And they , to my good fortune , did n't set fire to the apartment , and left . Oh , yes , I just remembered . While they were raping me they repeated quite frequently , `` Let the Armenian women have babies for us , Muslim babies , let them bear Azerbaijanis for the struggle against the Armenians . '' Then they said , `` Those Muslims can carry on our holy cause . Heroes ! '' They repeated it very often . - - - reference for # 008 - - - [ 1 ] _The Sumgait Tragedy ; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan , Volume I , Eyewitness Accounts_ , edited by Samuel Shahmuradian , forward by Yelena Bonner , 1990 , published by Aristide D.

I always like your kind of odds . The Greek governments must be held to account for the sub-human conditions of the Turkish minority living in the Western Thrace under the brutal Greek domination . The religious persecution , cultural oppression and economical ex-communication applied to the Turkish population in that area are the dimensions of the human rights abuse widespread in Greece . `` Greece 's Housing Policies Worry Western Thrace Turks '' ... Newly built houses belonging to members of the minority community in Dedeagac province , had , he said , been destroyed by Evros province public works department on Dec. 4 . Sungar added that they had received harsh treatment by the security forces during the demolition . `` This is not the first demolition in Dedeagac province ; more than 40 houses were destroyed there between 1979-1984 and members of that minority community were made homeless , '' he continued . `` Greece Government Rail-Roads Two Turkish Ethnic Deputies '' While World Human Rights Organizations Scream , Greeks Persistently Work on Removing the Parliamentary Immunity of Dr. Sadik Ahmet and Mr. Ahmet Faikoglu . In his 65-page confession , Salman Demirok , a former chief of PKK operations in Hakkari confessed that high-level relations between PKK , Greece and Greek Cypriot administration existed . According to Demirok , Greek Cypriot administration not only gives shelter to PKK guerillas but also supplies them with food and weapons at the temporary camps set up in its territory . Demirok disclosed that PKK has three safe houses in South Cyprus , used by terrorists such as Ferhat . In the camps , he added , terrorists were trained to use various weapons including RPG 's and anti-aircraft guns which had been purchased directly from the Greek government . Greek Cypriot government has gone to the extent of issuing special identification cards to PKK members so that they can travel from one region to another without being confronted by legal obstacles . Demirok 's account was confirmed by another PKK defector , Fatih Tan , who gave himself over to police in Hakkari after spending four years with PKK . Tan explained that the terrorists went through a training in camps in South Cyprus , sometimes for a period of 12 weeks or more . `` Torture in Greece : Hidden Reality '' Case 1 : Kostas Andreadis and Dimitris Voglis . ...

SOURCE : The British Broadcasting Corporation , Summary of World Broadcasting -July 6 , 1987 : Part 4-A : The Middle East , ME/8612/A/1 . `` Abu Nidal 's Advisers '' Reportedly Training `` PKK & ASALA Militants '' in Cyprus Nicosia , Ankara , Tel Aviv . The Israeli secret service , Mossad , is reported to have acquired significant information in connection with the camps set up in the Troodos mountains in Cyprus for the training of militants of the PKK and ASALA { Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia } . According to sources close to Mossad , about 700 Kurdish , Greek Cypriot and Armenian militants are undergoing training in the Troodos mountains in southern Cyprus . The same sources stated that Abu Nidal 's special advisers are giving military training to the PKK and ASALA militants in the camps . They added that the militants leave southern Cyprus for Libya , Lebanon , Syria , Greece and Iran after completing their training . Mossad has established that due to the clashes which were taking place among the terrorist groups based in Syria , the PKK and ASALA organisations moved to the Greek Cypriot part of Cyprus , where they would be more comfortable . They also transferred a number of their camps in northern Syria to the Troodos mountains . Mossad revealed that the Armenian National Movement , which is known as the MNA , has opened liaison offices in Nicosia , Athens and Tripoli in order to meet the needs of the camps . The offices are used to provide material support for the Armenian camps . Meanwhile , the leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine , George Habash , is reported to have ordered his men not to participate in the operations carried out by the PKK & ASALA , which he described as `` extreme racist , extreme nationalist and fascist . '' Reliable sources have said that Habash believed that the recent operations carried out by the PKK militants show that organisation to be a band of irregulars engaged in extreme nationalist operations . They added that he instructed his militants to sever their links with the PKK and avoid clashing with it . It has been established that George Habash expelled ASALA militants from his camp after ASALA 's connections with drug trafficking were exposed .

Special to The New York Times ATHENS , June 26 - A dispute developed today between Athens and Washington over United States intelligence reports saying that Athens , for several months , conducted negotiations with the terrorist known as Abu Nidal ... They said the contacts were verified in what were termed hard intelligence reports . Abu Nidal leads the Palestinian splinter group Al Fatah Revolutionary Council , implicated in the 1985 airport bombings at Rome and Vienna that contributed to the Reagan Administration 's decision to bomb Tripoli , Libya , last year . In Washington , State Department officials said that when Administration officials learned about the contacts , the State Department drafted a strongly worded demarche . The officials also expressed unhappiness with Greece 's dealings with ASALA , the Armenian Liberation Army , which has carried out terrorist acts against Turks ... .

One hopes that a Lebanese government will be strong enough to patrol its border but there is NO reason to believe it will be any stronger . WHAT HAS CHANGED is that the PLO was largely *driven out* of Lebanon ( not by the Lebanese , not by Syria ) and THAT is by far the most important making it EASIER to control future Palestinian attacks from Lebanese soil . That **change** was brought about by Israeli action ; the PLO would *never* have been ejected by Lebanese , Arab state or UN actions . > > Please , Tim , do n't fall into the trap of treating Lebanese and Palestinians > as all part of the same group .

I saw him play in the Swedish championship game for junior players this year , and he played very well , a physical game , but not the kind of rough stuff that Ulfie does ( I suspect you would like to have a Ulf type-of-player on the B 's team too ? : ) As for Mariusz Czerkawski , he has had a *great* season for Hammarby in division 1 . He scored -if I remember correctly- 93 points this season , and then we have to keep in mind that a 50+ point season in Sweden is considered *very good* due to the limited number of games . Mariusz is Djurgarden property ( he was just on loan to Hammarby ) , so he will play in Elitserien next season , unless the B 's can get him of course . I would say that Mariusz has to be one of the most exciting player to watch in Swedish hockey this season .

Because his messengership is universal , he has been distinguished by miracles that relate to almost all species of creation . Just as the supreme aide of a renowned ruler , arriving with many gifts in a city where various people live , will be welcomed by a representative of each people who acclaims him and bids him welcome in his own language so , too , when the supreme messenger of the Monarch of Pre- and Post-Eternity ( Ezel and Ebed Sultani ) honored the universe by coming as an envoy to the inhabitants of the earth , and brought with him the light of truth and spiritual gifts sent by the Creator of the universe and derived from the realities of the whole universe , each species of creation -from water , rocks , trees , animals and human beings to the moon , sun and stars- welcomed him and acclaimed his prophethood , each in its own language , and each bearing one of his miracles . Now it would require a voluminous work to mention all his miracles . As the punctilious scholars have written many volumes concerning the proofs of His prophethood , here we will briefly point out only the general category into which fall fhe miracles that are definite and accepted as accurate reports . The evidences of the prophethood of Muhammad ( SAW ) fall into two main categories : The first is called irhasat and includes the paranormal events that happened at the time of his birth , or before his declaration of prophethood . The second group pertains to all the remaining evidences of the prophethood , and contains two subdivisions : 1 ) Those wonders that were manifested after his departure from this world in order to confirm his prophethood , and 2 ) Those that he exhibited during the era of his prophethood . The latter has also two parts : 2.1 ) The evidences of his prophethood that became manifest in his own personality , his inner and outer being , his moral conduct and perfection , and 2.2 ) The miracles that : related to substantial matters . The last part again has two branches : 2.2.1 ) Those concerning the Qur'an and spirituality , and 2.2.2 ) Those relating to matter and creation . This last branch is again divided into two categories : 2.2.2.1 ) The first involves the paranormal happenings that occured during his mission either to break the stubbornness of the unbelievers , or to augment the faith of the belivers . This category has twenty different sorts , such as the splitting of the moon , the flowing of water from the fingers , the satisfying of large numbers with a little food , and the speaking of trees , rocks and animals Each of these sons has also many instances , and thus has , in meaning , the strength of confirmation by consensus . 2.2.2.2 ) As for the second category , this includes events lying in the future that occured as he had predicted upon Allah ( SWT ) 's instructions . Now starting from the last category , we will summarize a list of them . ( 1 ) ( 1 ) Unfonunately , I could not write as I had intended without choice , I wrote as my head dictated , and I could not completely conform to the order of this classification . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - To be Continued Allah Willing .

Not surprisingly , literature promoting cognitive therapy also claims to be superior . What are the facts ? Early in my research I did n't have a bias towards either medication or cognitive therapy . I was interested in a treatment that worked . After reading journals published after 1986 , the cognitive therapy camp claims a higher success rate ( approx 80 % ) , a lower drop-out rate , and no side effects associated with medication .

Well , I 'm no expert , but all of the histories of Nazi Germany assert this . They make reference to several scandals that occurred long before `` the night of the long knives '' . The impression that I got was that homosexuality in portions of the SA was common knowledge . Also , a book ( by a homosexual author whose name escapes me at the moment ) called `` Homosexuals in History '' asserts that Roehm and Heines were homosexuals , as well as others in Roehm 's SA circle . > All the books say that Roehm and his associate , Edmund Heines , > were homosexual . I have been able to find nothing beyond that , and > suspect this to be a sort of historical urban legend . Well , you 're the one who is in Germany . If you do n't believe the history books , look up the primary sources yourself . Those of us outside of Germany do not have access to these . You do . It seems to me that there were plenty of documented instances - several scandals , the fact that on the `` knight of the long knives '' several SA members ( including Heines ) were found sleeping together , etc . Also I believe some people were complaining about the SA's homosexual activities ( seducing young boys , etc ) . The histories that I 've read make a very convincing case . None of this sounds like urban legend to me . > ( Irving , a > notoriously unreliable historian , says that Funk , the Nazi finance > minister , was homosexual . He gives no sources . ) I know next to nothing about Irving and nothing about Funk . What precisely do you know , that would contradict all of the other history books that I have read concerning the existence of homosexual Nazis ? Are you trying to say that all historians are taking part in an anti-homosexual smear ? What about homosexual writers who agree with the official history ? Do n't you think they would have found out the truth by now if Roehm and Heines were not homosexuals ? I would think they would want to disassociate homosexuality from Nazism . No one should use any connection between the two to bash homosexuals in any case . > I challenge anyone to document this claim . If you are going to challenge *all* historians on this point ( not just Irving ) , then the burden of proof is on you . Track down the references . Find out where the stories originate from . Again , you are the one in Germany , close to archival material - most people on the net are not . > I *have* found a great > deal of evidence that there were many flaming heterosexuals among the > Nazis . This seems to include all of the worst ones -- Hitler , Himmler , > Goebbels , Goering , Heydrich , Eichmann , and many more . Eh ? What is your agenda here ? To prove that the Nazis were heterosexuals , so that you can bash heterosexuals ? Does it bother you that some of the Nazis might have been homosexuals ? Does this make all homosexuals bad if this is true ? Of course not . And what about bisexuals ? Are they half-Nazis ? I do n't know why it would be so difficult to believe that some Nazis were homosexuals . The German officer corps before WW1 , for instance , was notorious for its homosexuality . There were numerous scandals which rocked the German govt . during the late 19th and early 20th century . Many of the Kaiser 's friends were prosecuted - the Kaiser was no homosexual , but the Germany army had a long tradition of tolerating homosexuality , going far back into Prussian history - back to Frederick the Great at least , who was himself a homosexual . Roehm was a product of this Prussian officer tradition , and the old German army ( like the English public school system ) , being a well known center of homosexuality , would have been quite willing to overlook Roehm 's homosexuality . In addition , some Nazis complained of homosexuality in the Hitler Youth . The Hitler Youth swallowed up all pre-Nazi youth groups , and some of the various pre-war Vandervogel , Bund , and Volkish youth groups were known to promote homoerotic ideals and friendship , and in many cases , homosexuality itself . So it seems to me not unlikely that there were plenty of homosexual Nazis , regardless of the official Nazi dogmas concerning the `` evils '' of homosexuality . Why should this suprise anyone ? Homosexuality has always existed , in all societies - it would be most unusual if the Nazis were an exception . No , I do n't have any sources for you , as I think the only kind of proof you will accept would be citations from archival material , and I do not have access to these . Nor do I intend to reread every book on the Nazis and on modern homosexuality that I have ever read - I do n't have the time . Nothing is stopping you , however , from chasing down those sources . Until you prove otherwise , though , I will stick with the established histories . /\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/ David Matthew Deane ( deane @ binah.cc.brandeis.edu ) '' ...

From : lvc @ cbnews.cb.att.com ( Larry Cipriani ) Subject : DeConcini -- ten years ago and today Organization : Ideology Busters , Inc. Distribution : usa Lines : 120 Dennis Deconcini , 1982 ... In these and similar areas , the Bureau has violated not only the dictates of common sense , but of 5 U.S.C . Sec 552 , which was intended to prevent `` secret lawmaking '' by administrative bodies . These practices , amply documented in hearings before this Sub- committee , leave little doubt that the Bureau has disregarded rights guaranteed by the constitution and laws of the United States . It has trampled upon the second amendment by chilling exercise of the right to keep and bear arms by law-abiding citizens . It has offended the fourth amendment by unreasonably search- ing and seizing private property . It has ignored the Fifth Amendment by taking private property without just compensation and by entrapping honest citizens with- out regard for their right to due process of law . The rebuttal presented to the Subcommittee by the Bureau was utterly unconvincing . Richard Davis , speaking on behalf of the Treasury Department , asserted vaguely that the Bureau 's priorities were aimed at prosecuting willful violators , particularly felons ille- gally in possession , and at confiscating only guns actually likely to be used in crime . He also asserted that the Bureau has recently made great strides toward achieving these priorities . No documen- tation was offered for either of these assertions . In hearings before BATF 's Appropriations Subcommittee , however , expert evidence was submitted establishing that approximately 75 percent of BATF gun prosecutions were aimed at ordinary citizens who had neither criminal intent nor knowledge , but were enticed by agents into unknowning technical violations . ( Exerpt from : 97th Congress ; 2d Session COMMITTEE PRINT T H E R I G H T T O K E E P A N D B E A R A R M S REPORT of the SUBCOMMITTEE ON THE CONSTITUTION of the COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY UNITED STATES SENATE NINETY-SEVENTH CONGRESS SECOND SESSION FEBRUARY , 1982 Printed for the use of the Committee on the Judiciary U.S. GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE 88-618 O WASHINGTON : 1982 Letter to Constituent : April 1993 Thank you for contacting me regarding the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , and Firearms ( ATF ) , which is the Federal law enforcement agency with jurisdiction over firearms violations and regulations . It has been my experience as chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Treasury , Postal Service and General Government which funds ATF , that ATF is one of the most competent and highly professional law enforcement agencies in the Federal government . The agents of ATF have proven their value again and again in successful , legal operations to curb the unlawful possession and use of firearms , especially in the area of drug-related crimes . It enforces the Armed Career Criminal Act which calls for mandatory minimum sentences for repeat felons using firearms to carry out an illegal activity . The Bureau has made itself a key component in preventing gang related violence , also , both by educating at-risk youth to the dangers of gang membership as well a s by depriving known gangs from access to weapons . The Waco , Texas case involved the execution of search warrants by ATF on the Branch Davidians for illegal firearms and explosives possession ( automatics , semi-automatics , and machine-guns , in addition to bombs and other explosives . ) In virtually every gun case , ATF is asked to trace weapons through its ' National Firearms Tracing Center , where they keep all dealer and Federal firearms license information . ATF is the Federal governments ' firearms expert and routinely works with state and local police to execute warrants . ATF , working with state and local law enforcement in Texas and the U.S . Attorneys ' office felt it was necessary to execute these warrants in order to legally establish that a crime had been committed and conclude a long and thorough investigation of illegal gun and explosives held by members of the Branch Davidians . In addition , ATF carefully selected a Sunday morning , knowing from their source , inside , that the men would be separated from the women and children and not in the area where it was known that the illegal weapons were stored . As you may be aware by now , Vernon Howell a.k.a . David Koresh spiritual leader of the Branch Davidians was tipped of the impending execution of the search warrants . Unfortunately , ATF lost the element of surprise and the cult was able to arm themselves and prepare for ATFs ' entry into the compound . Once a hostage situation presented itself , the ATF asked the FBI to become involved since the FBI is skilled in hostage negotiations . In addition , and military tanks were brought in due to the serious nature of the situation and firepower of the Branch Davidians . Based on what I have learned about ATF 's role in the Branch Davidian raid , I believe the agency acted responsibly . I am , however , deeply saddened by the loss of lives of the 4 law enforcement agents who attempted to enter the compound and the civilian members of the cult . I fully expect the Department of Treasury to conduct a thorough evaluation with representatives from law enforcement outside the Department to be headed by the Assistant Secretary for Enforcement . In addition , ATF will conduct its ' own review of the Waco operation . I look forward to reviewing the findings of the evaluators and hope this situation in Waco will be brought to a quick and peaceful conclusion .

As I 've noted before , I 'm not necessarily disputing the benefits of eliminating anti-competitive legislation with regard to auto dealers , barbers , etc . One need not , however , swallow the entire libertarian agenda to accomplish this end . Just because one grants the benefits of allowing anyone who wishes to cut hair to sell his/her services without regulation does not mean that the same unregulated barbers should be free to bleed people as a medical service without government intervention . ( As some/many libertarians would argue . ) On a case by case basis , the cost/benefit ratio of government regulation is obviously worthwhile . The libertarian agenda , however , does not call for this assessment . It assumes that the costs of regulation ( of any kind ) always outweigh its benefits . This approach avoids all sorts of difficult analysis , but it strikes many of the rest of us as dogmatic , to say the least . I have no objection to an analysis of medical care , education , national defense or local police that suggests a `` free market '' can provide a more effective , efficient means of accomplishing social objectives than is provided through `` statist '' approaches . With some notable exceptions , however , I do not see such nitty-gritty , worthwhile analysis being carried out by self-professed libertarians . jsh -- Steve Hendricks | DOMAIN : steveh @ thor.ISC-BR.COM '' One thing about data , it sure does cut| UUCP : ... ! uunet ! isc-br ! thor ! steveh the bulls**t.

While Atlanta has the undisputed best starting rotation , I feel that their relief staff may be suspect .

True , but that is exactly the `` problem '' : the Mormon extermination order was issued not just by a Christian , it was ALLOWED under the Constitution of the United States , which was instituted precisely to prevent incidents like this `` order '' from occurring in the first place ... As I indicated in an earlier posting , your `` irrational hatred '' is clearly evidenced by individuals like Robert Weiss ( who could have been Gov . Boggs ' Lieutenant ; he would have fitted right in , drewling et al ) , and seems a modern-day occurrence , based on results ( slander , persecution , misrepresentation , lies , denying Mormons representation in their own user group , etc . etc . In intent and purpose , what really has changed ? # The situation is not entirely different today . Many irrational feelings # and beliefs are justified through religion .

In the early 1980s , I believe , the late President Kimball ( lds church # > leader ) strongly protested federal attempts to locate the MX- '' Peace Keeper '' # > missile maze from being built in Utah ( yet another `` inspired '' decision from # secular authorities ) . Fortunately , his opposition was influential enough # for the feds to back off . # # Do you mean that the `` secular authorities '' are some continuous group of # people with the common and uninterrupted goal of harrassing/eradicating the # Mormons ? Do you honestly believe that the main reason for using Utah for # nuclear testing etc.. was to `` get them thar Mormons '' ? And what about the # majority of Uthan 's who are n't Mormons ? You seem to be searching for enemy ^^^^^^^^ ( Correction : the majority of Utahn 's ARE Mormon ( 60-70 % I believe , up to a 100 % in many cities and settlements throughout the Western states . ) # conspiracies . It is paranoid to believe that everything that affects you # badly must have been done primarily for that purpose . What I mean is that secular authorities are to be watched , as we believe that Satan has been given some power and dominion over the earth to divert truth , judgment , and justice . In addition , we believe that the adversary has power to influence the unjust and idolatrous ( greed for money would be a good example ) in order to bring about persecution , war , oppression , and evil combinations . As an intelligent being , do n't you suppose that the destroyer would yield his influence foremost on those with political power ? As far as Utah is concerned , what I pointed out were some horrible examples of environmental nightmares imposed upon by secular authorities , which have brought death , disease , ( i.e . the `` downwinders '' ) and environmental contami- nation . I am hardly `` paranoid , '' I am just not `` expecting '' too much from a secular government that may not share our values and faith , and which indeed ( as Gov . Boggs et al . ) may be out to harm and destroy us . As a matter of fact , prophecies in my church indicate that in future years , ( global ) persecution against Mormons will so increase in intensity and scope , that ( paraphrasing ) `` all those who wish to escape persecution and murder must flee to Zion . '' Zion ( the `` pure in heart '' ) will be re-established in those days , and it AI N'T our current secular authorities who will rule over it ... # > ...

R. 1276 To establish the right to obtain firearms for security , and to use firearms in defense of self , family , or home , and to provide for the enforcement of such right . ======================= IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES March 10 , 1993 Mr. BARTLETT introduced the following bill ; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary ======================= A BILL To establish the right to obtain firearms for security , and to use firearms in defense of self , family , or home , and to provide for the enforcement of such right . Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa- tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled , SECTION 1 . SHORT TITLE . This Act may be cited as the `` Citizens ' Self-Defense Act of 1993 '' . SEC . 2 . RIGHT TO OBTAIN FIREARMS FOR SECURITY , AND TO USE FIREARMS IN DEFENSE OF SELF , FAMILY , OR HOME ; ENFORCEMENT . ( a ) ESTABLISHMENT OF RIGHT . -- A person not pro- hibited by Federal law from receiving a firearm shall have the right to obtain firearms for security , and to use fire- arms in defense of self , family , or home . ( b ) FIREARM DEFINED . -- As used in subsection ( a ) , the term `` firearm '' means a -- ( 1 ) shotgun ( as defined in section 921 ( a ) ( 5 ) of title 18 , United States Code ) ; ( 2 ) rifle ( as defined in section 921 ( a ) ( 7 ) of such title ) ; or ( 3 ) handgun ( as defined in section 10 of Public law 99-408 ) . ( c ) ENFORCEMENT OF RIGHT . -- ( 1 ) IN GENERAL . -- A person whose right under subsection ( a ) is violated in any manner may bring an action in any United States district court against the United States , any State , or any person for damages , injunctive relief , and such other relief as the court deems appropriate . ( 2 ) AUTHORITY TO AWARD A REASONABLE AT- TORNEY 'S FEE . -- In an action brought under para- graph ( 1 ) , the court , in its discretion , may allow the prevailing party , other than a State , a reasonable attorney 's fee as part of the costs . ( d ) STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS . -- An action may not be brought under subsection ( c ) ( 1 ) after the 5-year period that begins with the date the violation described therein is discovered . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- ( end of HR 1276 ) -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Well , this sounds good to me . The key is Section ( 2 ) ( c ) ( 2 ) , which will effectively open up the Federal court system to all the folks who ca n't afford to adopt an Attorney with whom to fight city hall . All of you who 've been saying `` hey , is n't that illegal ? '' could just go hire your own Attorneys on a pay-if-you-win ( `` contingency fee '' ) basis , and sue the bums ... : - ) What you can do now : ( 1 ) Write your Representative , and ask them to co-sponsor HR 1276 . ( 2 ) Write Representative Roscoe Bartlett , the sponsor -- Representative Roscoe Bartlett 312 Cannon House Office Building Washington , D.C. 20515 -- to tell him who your own Representative is , and that you've asked them to join him as a co-sponsor of HR 1276 . ( 3 ) Contact Gun Owners of America -- Gun Owners of America 8001 Forbes Place Springfield , Virginia 22151 -- which has committed to lobby on behalf of HR 1276 . ( 4 ) For those of us with a RealJob ( TM ) , find out how to reach Representative Bartlett 's campaign fund ( I 'm working on it ) and toss in a few bucks . You can bet your bippy that he's going to be one of the HCI `` targets '' in the next election , which is n't that far away ( 1994 ) . ( 5 ) Tell your family , friends , gun club , etc .

More along the lines of Hebrews 12:25-29 , I reckon ... See that you refuse not him that speaks . For if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth , much more shall not we escape , if we turn away from him that speaks from heaven : Whose voice then shook the earth : but now he has promised , saying , Yet once more I shake not the earth only , but also heaven . And this word , Yet once more , signifies the removing of those things that are shaken , as of things that are made , that those things which can not be shaken may remain . Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which can not be moved , let us have grace , whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear : For our God is a consuming fire . Or 2nd Thessalonians 1:7-10 ... And to you who are troubled rest with us , when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels , In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God , and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ : Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord , and from the glory of his power ; When he shall come to be glorified in his saints , and to be admired in all them that believe ( because our testimony among you was believed ) in that day . Kinda gives Flaming a whole new meaning , I reckon . - < > - The impression I got from talking with Livingston was that the coming of the Lord , power-wise , is going to be something that those who are unprepared ca n't handle -- kinda like overloading a fuse -- due to guilt . Somehow it seems to also apply to the entire physical world as we know it . LF suggests that God does n't want that and has sent Koresh as a reminder . Seems that those who have been purified through salvation , or that those protected by the Seals , will be the ones who survive . And no -- I do n't have a good idea yet what `` being shielded by the seals '' actually involves or how exactly it relates to salvation . ( Other than it involves the marriage of the Bridegroom and the Bride ... for those of you Biblical well versed . ) - < > - Me personally , I 'm totally 100 % dependent on God through Christ , so if God wants me to understand , good .

From : simon @ monu6.cc.monash.edu.au Subject : Saint Story St. Aloysius Gonzaga Organization : Monash University , Melb. , Australia . Lines : 113 Heres a story of a Saint that people might like to read . I got it from a The Morning Star , and am posting it with the permission of the editor . Saint Aloysius Gonzaga The Patron of Youth The marquis Gonzaga had high aspirations for his son , the Prince Gonzage . He wanted him to become a famous , brave and honoured soldier . After all , he must carry on the great family name of Gonzaga . Of course , he was to become far more famous , brave and honoured than his father could ever have imagined ; though not in the manner expected . Saint Aloysius ' mother was a woman who received immense joy from praying to God and meditating on the divine mysteries and the life of Our Lord . She had little time for the pleasures of this life . As Saint Aloysius grew , he began to resemble his mother more than his father . Saint Aloysius had learned numerous expressions from his father's soldiers , but the moment he discovered that they were vulgar , he fainted from shock . This shows his immense hatred of sin ( What an example for us of the contempt we must have for sin ) . About the time of his First Holy Communion ( which he received from the Archbishop of Milan , Charles Borromeo , whom himself became a great Saint ) , he con-secrated his purity to God and asked the Blessed Virgin to protect his innocence for life . He wanted to share Our Lord 's suffering to show his reciprocal love . He started by denying his passions ; he avoided eating the finest foods , wearing the best clothes , and would put pieces of wood in his bed in order to mortify himself for the love of God . While he was in his early teens his father sent him ( and his younger brother ) to the court of the Spanish King , Phillip 11 . Obediently , he set out to make the best of it . He mixed in well with the people of the royal court , for he was handsome , polite , intelligent and always had something interesting to say . Not long before this time , the great soldier-saint , Saint Igna- tius of Loyola , had founded the Society of Jesus ( the Jesuits ) towards which Saint Aloysius -12- began to have a yearning . When he finally told his father , the marquis flew into a rage and forbade his son to become a priest . After a short time , his father sent him to the great cities in order that he be tempted away from the priesthood , but even through these trials , Saint Aloysius grew in his desire for the religious life and was strengthened in the virtue of purity . The Marquis ' plans were obviously failing , so he con-fronted his son : `` Will you or will you not obey me and forget this foolish- ness ? '' `` I will not , father , '' was the in-evitable reply . `` Then leave from my sight and do n't return until you change your mind ! '' With tears clouding his eyes , the Saint left the room to pray : `` Tell me Lord , what am I to do ? Tell me ! Tell me ! '' He knelt down to flagellate himself as he had done several times before , but this time he was seen . The onlooker rushed to the marquis . This at last brought the proud man to his senses . `` The Lord wants him , the Lord can have him . '' He gave his consent for his son to become a Jesuit . After some years ( at the end of the sixteenth century ) , a terri- ble epidemic broke out in Rome . All the hospitals were full and could house no more , so the Jesuits opened their own . Saint Aloy- sius did all he could in the hospitals , particularly to prepare the dying for a holy death . Saint Aloysius himself contracted the plague from carrying and nursing the sick . For three months he lay with a burning fever and finally , on June 21st , 1591 , he gave his soul to the Lord while gazing at a crucifix . Let us invoke Saint Aloysius as our patron and imitate him in his humility , purity and confidence in prayer . Saint Aloysius Gonzaga , pray for us . - Brendan Arthur Prayer is as necessary to a person consecrated to the service of others as a sword is to a soldier God Bless From Simon Lines : 106 -- / -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- | -- -- -- -\ | Simon P.

This is exactly what it has become -- a far cry from > its original position of stature . Looking at [ 1 ] we find that during Roman times `` Tyre vied with Sidon for first place in the intellectual life of the period '' ; that Tyre was the seat of a Christian bishop , eventually with 14 dioceses under it ; that `` the most magnificent church of its kind in all Phoenecia '' was the basilica built in Tyre ca . 314 ; that Tyre was well known for its exports of glassware , wine , white marble , and dyed cloth ; that Tyre , along with other seaports , `` provided outlets for South Arabian , Indian and even Chinese trade '' ; that Tyre had to accomodate its growing population by `` following a perpendicular , rather than horizontal , line of growth '' ( because it was running out of land to build on ) ; that Tyre established colonies of its own . None of this sounds like a `` small fishing village '' by any stretch of the imagination . Centuries later , under the Abbasids , Tyre had `` opulent and flourishing bazaars '' and buildings of 5-6 stories . During this period , Tyre was '' noted for its export of sugar , beads , and , as of old , glassware . '' During the Crusades , Tyre was the second-most flourishing city held by Franks . ( There is a lot more , but I got tired of writing . ) In [ 2 ] we read the following description of modern Lebanon : `` other *major cities* in Lebanon include Tripoli , Sidon , Tyre , Baalbek and Zahlah . '' [ my emphasis ] This source also discusses the impact of the Lebanese Civil War , and the Israeli military actions ( 1978 , 1982 ) on the trading ports of Tyre and Sidon . It notes that after Israel's withdrawel in 1984 , `` Tyre appeared to enjoy a revival of its local economy . '' If Tyre is such an insignificant little fishing village at present , why is it always called a city ( or , above , a `` major city '' ) ? Why does it show up on all the maps ? When population figures for cities in Lebanon are given , why is Tyre always one of the cities on the list ( even if the list is only a dozen cities long ) ? [ 1 ] Philip K.

By modern standards > we are talking about a one-horse town . A one-horse town ? Sounds like a lot of work for one horse . ( Anyway , Tyre is connected by roads to the mainland . They may even use cars these days . : - ) The 1991 Encyclopedia Britannica says `` Pop . ( 1982 est . ) 23,000 . '' Most other references give figures in the 14-17 thousand range . ( One atlas gives the population of Tyre as 60,000 ; the same source give comparatively high figures for Sidon and Beirut , also , so I doubt that it is a typo . Perhaps these were figures for the cities and their surrounding areas . ) I do n't doubt that the population of Tyre has fluctuated over the last few decades . In particular , the 1982 Israeli military action hurt Tyre quite a bit . > > After Alex the G it fell once more in the 1200 's , I believe .

I thought you were talking about times that Tyre was destroyed . Do n't most , if not all , of these apply not just to Tyre but to the other cities in the area ? Sidon , for example ? Can you make a case for Tyre having been singled out ? > > Well , it recovered enough to have a thriving commerce in the dye > > '' Tyrian purple '' in Roman times . > > This is correct , but they were under Roman domination , and the > majority of the created wealth was siphoned off . The prophesy > hold true . They had a good deal of autonomy under the Seleucids . From [ 2 ] : Tyre `` receiv [ ed ] the rights [ of autonomy ] from Antiochus Ephiphanes and from 125 BC onward enjoy [ ed ] complete autonomy . She started a large series of coins , occasionally in gold ... '' The descriptions of Tyre under the Romans do n't seem to fit your characterization , either . And under the Abbasids it seems to have been allowed to flourish . I still think you are stretching when you try to describe Tyre as having been nothing but a small fishing village . > Who is Josh McDowell .

'' Let us assume for the sake of argument that this was indeed the case ? Does this mean that Hilter would have been in any way less guilty of mass murder because he aquiesced rather than participated as an active and ardent supporter ? One of the important things to realise about the NAZIs is that the system was far more evil than any single member . Once created the NAZI party itself was a murder machine that would inevitably commit genocide , there was noone within it strong enough to prevent it . Remember that Hitler did not originaly lead the NAZI party nor was he particularly powerful within it until his oratory allowed the party to come to power . Had Hitler reneged upon the emotiaonal expectations which he had created within the ranks of his supporters he would have been replaced as he had himself replaced the old guard who he beleived were unable to grasp the intellectual implications of their rhetoric . This is why all parties that espouse NAZI style race supremacy ideologies must be considered as dangerous and as evil as the NAZIs . The idea that one `` race '' of people is inherently superior to another and that the greatest goal of humanity is to achieve racial perfection has only one logical outcome , the gas chambers of Auschwitz . The NAZI party is not simply the tale of a supremely evil single man who lead an entire country astray , beyond the evil of individuals there was the evil of the system itself which was self generating and self perpetuating . Hitler was an extreemly evil person who built his party arround an ego cult centered on the demonstration of his own power , this does not however mean that he was as entirely free from political constraints as he and his propagandists worked so hard to assert . The myth that racism can produce a strong government that can cure a nations ills must be emphatically rejected . In the same way we must accept a distinction between a govenrment that demonstrates its strength and one that is able to govern decisively in the manner it beleives is best . I would accept only the latter as a `` strong '' government since most displays of strength are made necessary by an essential weakness . It is important to understand that the NAZIs were not stupid nor were they amoral in the sense that they lacked moral scruples . They acted in the same manner as the Spanish Inquisition - murder and torture in the cause of morality . The fault of the NAZIs lies in their axioms , not in their logic nor in their implementation of those axioms . Thus all such parties such as the National Front or David Dukes Klu Klux Klan front who assert the truth of those axioms must be considered for what they are , advocates of a system that would commit genocide . The conclusion that Hitler was not only responsible but imensely evil is inescapable from the historical record . It is important though to not let the conclusion be reached that the NAZIs espoused a set of ideas that were basically correct but had an unfortunate proponent . The evils of the concept of race supremacy are primary . Although this most emphaticaly does not excuse individual culpability this is nevertheless secondary . No matter what the promises made by a racist , supremacist party upon election those promises will be broken as soon as circumstances permit . If this requires the replacement of the leaders that originally made the pledges , that will occur . Hatred is a supreme justifier . It also creates a dynamic of its own when those in government allow it reign . For many in government politics is a method of providing a justification for their own existence through a demonstration of their importance . A rhetoric of hatred inevitably develops the question of action since the continued existence of an object of hatred is inevitably a reminder of the essential impotence of the politician . Thus we have the US raid on Tripoli which has little purpose beyond a demonstration of power . It is important to realise that there is no quantum jump between the politics of the right and those of the extreeme right but a progression from the reinforcement of popular predjudice to action being taken on the basis of that predjudice . In the same way the extreeme left trace their route to despotism through their assertion of the subjugation of the individual to ideology . It is important though that in attempting to understand the dynamics of political systems that this is not used to excuse the participants . The leaders of a nation take on a supreme moral burden but not only do so voluntarily are required to stive to do so . Thus to take on such a task without a fundamental examination of the logical progression of ones set of axioms to its conclusion in itself is a moral crime . Furthermore in taking on such a duty one is obliged to put the interest of the whole before personal concerns , even of personal security . Although it was inevitable that a party such as the NAZIs , based upon hatred and an idolisation of the symbols of power should have saught to commit genocide it was not inevitable that they should succeeded . Each member of the system had an ability to create a change within it that had a possibility of changing the dynamic . Realising that the individual can not hope to control a system does not mean accepting that the individual can not affect the system . Phill Hallam-Baker Phill Hallam-Baker

I am working on a project for my marketing class and I 'd like to ask your help . The assignment is to come up with a product and create a marketing plan for it . Technical issues are not terribly important at this point . Well , my group 's plan is to market a `` full page '' monitor for laptop computers . It would be a third-party product to be installed by authorized repair centers ( like Newer Technology 's PaletteBook screen ) . The idea is that the screen would fold in such a way that you would get twice the screen height of a normal screen ( remember , technical issues aside ! ) . In fact , by adjusting the fold of the screen and the monitor configuration , you could have regular OR `` full '' height . The screen would probably be monochrome . The motivation behind this is that laptop computers seem to be very popular among business people . Business people also commonly use word processing and spreadsheet applications for which it is very convenient to see a large portion of the document . Because of the target users and applications , color screens are n't really a neccessity . We could hopefully keep the cost between $ 2000 and $ 3000 . Now , please do n't write this off as completely ridiculous . I really need some constructive feedback . So , if you would , please reply to me via email and let me know : 1 .

From : SRUHL @ MECHANICAL.watstar.uwaterloo.ca ( Stefan Ruhl ) Subject : crappy Honda CX650 Lines : 24 Organization : University of Waterloo Hi , I just have a small question about my bike . Being a fairly experienced BMW and MZ-Mechanic , I just do n't know what to think about my Honda . She was using too much oil for the last 5000 km ( on my trip to Daytona bike week this spring ) , and all of a sudden , she trailed smoke like hell and was running only on one cylinder . I towed the bike home and took it apart , but everything looks in perfect working order . No cracks in the heads or pistons , the cylinder walls look very clean , and the wear of pistons and cylinders is not measurable . All still within factory specs . The only thing I could find , however , was a slightly bigger ring gap on the right cylinder ( the one with the problem ) , but it is still way below the wear-limit given in the Clymer-manual for this bike . Any syggestions ? ? ? What else could cause my problem ? ? ? Do I have to hone the cylinder walls ( make them a little rougher in a criss-cross-pattern ) in order to get better breaking in of my new rings ? ? ? Wo n't that increase the wear of my pistons ? ? Please send comments to sruhl @ mechanical.watstar.uwaterloo.ca Thanks in advance .

From : dswartz @ osf.org ( Dan Swartzendruber ) Subject : Re : Ax the ATF Organization : Open Software Foundation - Research Institute Distribution : usa Lines : 64 A few comments on the ATF 's botched handling of this case : 1 . Attempting to storm the compound in broad daylight ? The explanation we were given ( at least at one point ) was that they thought the cult members would be at religious services . My only comment on this bit of idiocy is that if you 're going to operate as a quasi-military unit , you 'd better understand basic military tactics . One cardinal rule is that only a fool plans an operation where if one assumption is incorrect , the operation will fail disastrously . 2 . We were told that ATF got four agents killed because they were outgunned , they did n't expect such heavy resistance . When questioned about why such an overwhelming military-style assault was planned , we were told that it was because the cultists were thought to be heavily armed . Can you say contradictory ? I knew you could ! 3 . The BATF has had a bad reputation for years as a bunch of arrogant , hotdoggers . I was talking to relatives a couple of weeks ago and referred to them as a bunch of Crockett and Tubbs wannabes . I'm more than ever convinced that 's right on target . An anecdote not related to the Waco fiasco is that apparently the BATF screwed up some of the evidence in the World Trade Center bombing . There's now an excellent chance some of the forensic evidence gathered by the FBI will not be admissible in court . This is not hearsay . I was told this by a relative of my wife 's who happens to be an FBI agent . His opinion of the BATF was , ummm , well , let 's just say uncomplimentary . 4 . I have *still* not been presented with one iota of evidence that the BD 's had *any* of the alleged illegal weaponry which was the reason for the raid in the first place . BTW , we 're *still* hearing this justification . AG Reno , on CNN yesterday , made references to this issue , without any substantiation . She also waved around the `` He 's a child abuser and we heard he was beating the children ! '' flag . Sigh . 5 . A point re the Feds in general : their handling of the whole siege reflected a complete lack of understanding of the probable thought processes of the cultists . AG Reno said they pushed the button because they were afraid a mass suicide was in the offing . My only comment on that is that if the cultists were that close to the edge , what the hell did she think their reaction would be to an hours-long assault on the compound where holes were punched in the walls and CS gas pumped in ? If I were a BD , I 'd expect the forces of the godless government to assault me at any time . In that light , whether they torched themselves or drank Jim Jones Kool-Aid is irrelevant . Also , look at how the siege was conducted : Bright lights , loud rock music , cutting off communications and other contact with the outside . All measures designed to make the BD 's feel more and more isolated and threatened . This might have been a great strategy - if they were dealing with criminals . As it was , it looks to me like everything they did fed into Koresh's paranoid delusions . -- # include < std_disclaimer.h > Dan S .

I really hope Baines can provide the RF support the O 's need . Orsulak was decent but I had hoped that Chito Martinez could learn defense better and play like he did in '91 . The O 's right now do n't have many left-handed hitters . Anderson proving last year was no fluke and Cal 's return to his averages would be big plusses in a drive for the pennant .

I haven't even seen anything anecdotal on it . Given how common they are eaten - do you know any child or adolescent who *doesn't* eat the stuff ? - I think that if there were a relationship we would know it by now . Also , there 's nothing weird in those cereals . As far as the brain is concerned ( except for a few infantile metabolic disorders such as galactosemia ) , sugar is sugar , regardless if it is coated on cereal , sprinkled onto cereal , or dissolved in soda , coffee or whatever .

You 've just explained why we use OBP and SLG to evaluate players . Precisely because the team that scores more runs wins the game . Traditional baseball stats have gotten way too far away from methods which enable fans to see who contributes to those runs scored - that's where OBP , SLG , Runs Created , Linear Weights , etc . come in .

Subject : Is SMARTDRV.EXE causing bad sectors on my hd ? From : jdriver @ netlink.cts.com ( John Driver ) Organization : NetLink Online Communications , San Diego CA Lines : 47 I am having something very unusual happen . First some background on my system . I have a Mitsubishi 63 meg Hard Drive , and am running Smartdrv ( the version that comes with Windows 3.1 ) on it . I rarely use Windows . I use a program called Disk Technician Gold v1.14 to do diagnostics live time on my hard drive . It works by having a device driver detect whenever more than one read is necessary for a file , or if there is anything else is wrong with it , and minor problems are fully checked out upon rebooting . My hard drive is notorious for bad sectors . I usually end up with 8 new bad sectors a week . Here 's what happened : I ran a program , and DTG broke in with an Emergency Warning and recommended I reboot . It gave me this message twice before the program was fully loaded . I exited the program and did just this . DTG went through its bootup process , examining for new errors etc. , and a screen popped up and said something about sectors for a brief period of time . I then went back to the program , executed it again , and the exact same error was detected . I rebooted and tried again , and the same error happened again . So , I removed DTG from memory , and went to the program to see if I could detect anything wrong . Sure enough there was a number of read attempts . So I rebooted and reloaded DTG , but removed the cache . I executed the program . No read errors , either audible or detected by DTG . I quit the program , loaded the cache , and ran the program again . The errors were detected . Ok , so the errors are there , and DTG detects but does n't fix them , when the cache is loaded . When the cache is not loaded there are no errors . So , to see if the cache was interfering with any other files , I went into xtree gold and tagged all files , and searched them for a random string ( in other words , I wanted the program to completely read every file on my hard drive ) . Before I got through the c 's DTG had detected at least six errors and recommended I reboot . Does anybody , have any idea why Smartdrv is causing misreads on my hard drive ? Oh , there are exactly two misreads per file , and 1 in about every 100 files are affected . I originally posted this message to Disk Technician Corp. 's system , but I figured someone out in netland may know enough about smartdrv to help me out . -- INTERNET : jdriver @ netlink.cts.com ( John Driver ) UUCP : ... ! ryptyde ! netlink ! jdriver NetLink Online Communications * Public Access in San Diego , CA ( 619 ) 453-1115

The issue has been studied before , and I doubt you could come up with any convincing argument the other way . People see the batting average and the HR , but they do n't really know their value is worth unless they 've studied the issue closely .

Good statement ! Should we apply empirical measurements to define exact social morals ? Should morals be based on social rules ? On ancient religious doctrines ? It seems there will *NEVER* be a common and single denominator for defining morals , and as such defining absolute and objective morals is doomed to fail as long as humans have this incredible talent of creative thinking .

Sorry , but *neither* 'dictates ' the cost . It 's a negotiation . Whether it 's up front at a honda dealership in an all out dickering war , or more removed on a larger economic scale ( ie , if saturn ca n't sell at it 's price , the price drops , or the company stops building them ) , it remains a negotiated value controlled by market forces . To think that the consumer controls price is ludicrous . If the consumer controled price , then cars would be *free* ... And no one would build cars .

So , you have the right unless the Federal Government says you do n't . I do n't think I like this very much . This would be much better if it said `` everyone except those who have been striped of this right by due process of law '' or some such thing . Also , I do n't care for the Federal Government stepping on states rights regardless of which state right is being stepped on .

Lines : 41 NNTP-Posting-Host : access.digex.net And now , I interrupt your regularly scheduled news reading to bring you another message sponsored by the Department of Really Mundane Statistics : I passed the final individual player stats posted here the other day through a filter to average out games , goals , assists , points , and penalty minutes for the mythical average NHL pro who played in the league this season . ( Why ? Because it 's Monday and I did n't feel like writing any REAL code ... ) Anyway , after I wiped out the 60-odd goalies in the list , I came up with : NHL average : 55 GP 11 G 19 A 30 Pts 69 PIM Then I passed the list through a second time to come up with the players who had the smallest percentage difference in each of the categories . Marty McInnis ( NYI ) 56 GP ( 1 % ) 10 G ( 9 % ) 20 A ( 5 % ) 30 Pts ( 0 % ) 24 PIM ( 65 % ) Igor Kravchuk ( EDM ) 55 GP ( 0 % ) 10 G ( 9 % ) 17 A ( 10 % ) 27 Pts ( 9 % ) 27 PIM ( 53 % ) These two are close in games , goals , assists , and points , but are too far off in PIM . This leaves , as the most average player in the NHL : Bobby Carpenter ( WAS ) 65 GP ( 18 % ) 11 G ( 0 % ) 17 A ( 10 % ) 28 Pts ( 6 % ) 63 PIM ( 8 % ) What an honor . I also passed the list through with the goalies still included . Kravchuk and Carpenter were still in the top three , but Rob DiMaio came flying up from behind to take the title : NHL average : 53 GP 10 G 17 A 27 Pts 64 PIM Igor Kravchuk ( EDM ) 55 GP ( 3 % ) 10 G ( 0 % ) 17 A ( 0 % ) 27 Pts ( 0 % ) 27 PIM ( 50 % ) Bobby Carpenter ( WAS ) 65 GP ( 22 % ) 11 G ( 10 % ) 17 A ( 0 % ) 28 Pts ( 3 % ) 63 PIM ( 1 % ) Rob DiMaio ( TB ) 54 GP ( 1 % ) 9 G ( 9 % ) 15 A ( 11 % ) 24 Pts ( 11 % ) 62 PIM ( 3 % ) It 's all really kind of underwhelming when you think about it . -SG And now , back to our regularly scheduled programming ...

I would n't expect to be able to do this . Not because the engineers at BMW are putting in anti-fraud logic , but just because an automobile is a noisy , hostile environment for electronics , and I would expect the software to be conservative . If I were to design a microprocessor-based odometer/speedometer program , it would have the following features ( just off the top of my head ) : * Debouncing/deglitching ( Is this a real pulse , or just a glitch ? ) * Smoothing : The rate-of-change of speed can not be too high : This is a car , not an electron . * Top speed limit : Anything above 200MPH is ridiculous : must be electrical noise or contact bounce As for getting in and presetting the pins : if this is the circuit board out of a BMW dashboard , I seem to remember a single big chip with lotsa pins in the middle of the card . Good luck getting at the counter : - ) . I would n't expect a high input frequency to damage the meter : remember , it's probably damped so it ca n't move too fast , and is probably protected .

BRUINS IN 5 . I 'm hoping for a Fuhr miracle , but I agree that Boston will likely win the series . Goaltending is about equal , top offensive players are about equal ( Mogilny-LaFontaine vs. Oates-Juneau ) , but Buffalo has no answer to Neely ( not to imply that Neely is not a top offensive player btw , in fact he 's one of my favourites even though he 's a damn Bruin : ) ) .

I ca n't predict a Montreal victory because I 've been watching them play for 6 weeks and IMO they severly need some tougher players , especially to play in the Garden . Last time they beat the B 's 5-2 but Boston had a clear territorial advantage ; the victory was Roy 's . At the same time , I can't bring myself to predict the possibility of a loss , so I 'll just say I will not be putting money on this series . : - ) > Patrick Division , semifinal > Pittsburgh vs. NY Islanders : > What can I say ?

They are very strong , IMO , and nobody knows *how* strong because they 've been underachieving most of the year . If forced to choose , though , I 'd have to take the Penguins . A side note . Vlad , last week you said that Selanne was a better player than Gilmour . NO WAY . He is a more talented pure goal scorer ... but aside from the age difference , there is no way I would take him over Gilmour on my team . I 'm not asking for flames , either , btw ... .I 've spent more than enough time arguing on behalf of Selanne and I still say he 's a great player . But while he and Gilmour are both dangerous offensively ( give Teemu an edge ) , Gilmour *does* *it* *all* . I know a lot of Gilmour-bashing goes on , esp . from Flame fans . But IMO you guys are letting your dislike of Gilmour cloud your judgement when it comes to his skill . He is easily one of the best all-round players in the NHL . dchhabra @ stpl.ists.ca

The last time I got stung by a bee I experienced the same reaction the first poster 's brother did . We went off to the doctor to see if I should worry about the fact that my foot was now about 3 times it 's normal size . ( And itched ! ! ! Ow ! ) He basically said I should n't this time , but that bee sting allergy was not something you tended to get aclimatized to , but were something that each time got progressively worse generally and that next time could be the time I go into anaphylactic shock . Admittedly this was many years ago when I was young . Since then I just make sure I don't get stung . I also should carry a bee sting kit with me , but I do n't . This is n't scientific or proof , but this would lead me to believe it 's not a different reaction , just a different degree of reaction . Allergies work that way . People have various reactions . Sort of like diabetes , some people can get by with just monitoring their diet , others have to monitor their diet and use insulin sometimes while others have to watch their diet like a hawk and use insulin regularly . I think MSG is probably similar ... some people have allergic reactions to it .

From : cathy @ LANCE.ColoState.Edu ( Cathy Smith ) Subject : WEIRD SCIENCE -- by L. Neil Smith Distribution : usa Nntp-Posting-Host : blanca.lance.colostate.edu Organization : Colorado State University , Fort Collins , CO 80523 Lines : 116 Posted by Cathy Smith for L. Neil Smith WEIRD SCIENCE Everyone knows how to tell when a politician is lying : his lips move . What may not be equally obvious is that there are politicians and then there are politicians -- and that the phrase '' political science '' is subject to more than one interpretation . Years ago , we heard how `` scientists '' were worried that a new Ice Age might be coming , and later on that `` nuclear winter '' -- smoke and dust thrown into the atmosphere by full-scale international unpleasantness -- was a possibility . Something like that may even have killed the dinosaurs . What we did n't hear was that no actual data supported any of this , that real-world events ( the burning of Kuwaiti oil fields ) tended to discredit it , that mostly it was propaganda meant to weaken values that made America the most successful culture in history , and that the dinosaurs probably died of something like the Plague when continents drifted together , exposing them to new germs . We miss a lot like this , unless we listen closely . Prince William Sound , site of the famous oil spill , and Mount St. Helen 's were n't supposed to recover from their respective disasters for at least 100 years . That turned out not to be true , although you 'd never know it from watching network nightly news or CNN . It does n't fit their agenda to inform us that the earth is vast and resilient , and that nature is rougher on herself than we could ever be . But for once , the media are n't entirely to blame . As ignorant of science as they are of everything , they trust `` scientists '' to unscrew the inscrutable . The trouble is that today 's `` scientists '' have agendas of their own . Nobody in government , that wellspring of scientific wherewithal , is going to offer grants to an investigator who states truthfully that there is no respectable evidence for `` global warming '' . The money and power for bureaucrats and politicians lie in mass transit , and they hate the automobile -- blamed as a major cause of the mythical crisis -- as a source of privacy and freedom they find intolerable . The same appears true of `` acid rain '' , a deliberate hoax cooked up by the Environmental Protection Agency ( which hates private industrial capitalism almost as much as it does your car ) and foisted on real scientists through trickery which has depended on specialists in different fields not talking to each other much . The list goes on , always with a common , disreputable thread . `` Ozone depletion '' , for which evidence is even more suspect and contradictory than for acid rain or global warming , is no more than a last , desperate attempt to indict private capitalism in an era when state central planning and the command economy have failed and can only find this final , withered leg to teeter on . Decades of anti-nuclear alarmism , resting on foundations of myth and panic-mongering , have failed to erase the fact that nuclear power is the safest , cleanest , most efficient source of energy known to mankind -- and more to the point , that the greater amount of energy there is available to any individual in society , the freer that individual -- and his society -- become . Honest studies on the effects of individual gun ownership and self-defense on crime -- conducted by investigators who began as ideological opponents to those concepts , but which show massive reductions in the latter to be the result of the former -- have been suppressed , most recently by the California state government . And what the media did n't say about recent EPA `` discoveries '' on the effect of `` secondhand smoking '' is that , although some harm to non- smokers may have been detected , it was less ( by an order or two of magnitude ) than that associated with frying bacon a couple times a week or keeping a pet bird . It 's enough to make you wonder whether there was ever anything to the claim that smoking causes cancer . That , of course , is the real threat represented by politically correct science . The world is a dangerous place . It would be nice to know the hazards . I 've never believed smoking to be a healthy practice , but , given a lack of credibility on the part of today 's science , how am I to decide what to do about it ? Nicotine is highly addictive , to that much I can attest from experience . Yet the stress of quitting may be riskier than to continue . There is n't any way to tell , thanks to the corrupting influence of government money on the scientific establishment . Two centuries ago , the Founding Fathers spared us certain agonies to which every other nation in the world has been subject at one time or another , by creating a legal barrier between politics and religion . Each time some short-sighted individual or group has tried to lower the barrier ( most recently over the issue of abortion ) , blood -- real human blood , hot and smoking in the street -- has wound up being shed . Real human blood is being shed over scientific issues , as people 's lives are ruined through the loss , to agencies like the EPA , of livelihood , or property it may have taken a lifetime to accumulate , to diseases caused by toxins associated with burning fossil fuels for electrical power , or thanks to bans on things like cyclamates , when they die from the effects of obesity . What we need now , if we hope to survive as a civilization for two more centuries , is another barrier , a Constitutional separation of state and science -- including medicine . Knowledge is valuable ; real science wo n't languish for lack of funding . The money will simply come from contributors unwilling to pay for lies , and everyone will benefit . L.

They probably can't tell Clippered voice from Clippered triple-DESed voice until they get their copy of your key . Any criminal who 's going to use encryption will do it under cover of Clipper . The only way to avoid this will be to try to prohibit strong encryption . I probably should n't say this , but they could try to detect the use of an illegal cypher by transmitting in the clear some statistical properties of the plaintext . An old-fashioned wiretap could then detect the use of pre-encryption , which would drastically increase the measured entropy of the input . A countermeasure to this would be to use steganographic techniques which put out voice .

Today I was turning a 90 degree corner just like on any other day , but there was a slight difference- a rough spot right in my path caused the suspension to compress in mid corner and some part of the bike hit the ground with a very tangible `` thunk '' . I pulled over at first opportunity to sus out the damage . My bike is a Kawasaki GPX250R with footpegs that are hinged and sprung such that they fold upward and backward on contact with ground etc. , and on the lower extreme corner of each peg there is mounted a `` bank-follower '' , or a little stud that theoretically is the first bit to hit the ground in a 100 % -banked turn . The stud is mounted on the footpeg by a threaded bit about 7 mm long , which screws into a threaded hole in the footpeg . Now for the mystery . The stud on the side of the bike that clunked when I turned was absent . I'm fairly sure it was there before the event . There was no damage to the end of the footpeg where the stud would ordinarily have been . In fact , the thread in the hole in the footpeg was perfectly intact , with no evidence of something having been forcefully ripped out of it only moments previously . Okay all you engineering types , how the f**k do you explain this ? How can you rip a tightly fitting steel thread out of a threaded hole ( in alloy ) without damaging the thread in the hole ? Is this some sort of hi-tech design thingo that Kawasaki never mentioned , like that the end of the footpeg suddenly changes phase on impact , to let the stud rip out , then changes back to a solid ? I 'm quite amazed at how this could have happened . In the meantime , life goes on , without a left-hand bank-follower . Barry Manor DoD # 620 confused accidental peg-scraper

By removing this line from the .xinitrc everything worked as planned and the clients connected to the server at ` hostname ` :1.0 Some comments on performance , I was connected to a Sparc 2 thru a NetBlazer Terminal Server over a 9600 baud line . My PC is a 486-DX2 ATI Ultra , 16 MB Bitmap Stuff Sucked . Basic Editing and compilation stuff definitely usable . Xmail was very usable . At times the first time U typed in an Xclient window there was a very noticable delay , I put this down to brain damaged `` WINDOWS should not be called a SCHEDULER '' , besides that this will become my remote work environment for a while . Has anybody tried the NON Windows version of the product , the sales person said they performed about the same , given the over head of WINDOWS I question this ? many thanks for help to all who responded gerard

I 'm not sure it is a major limiting move ... in the academic circles I 've seen , arguing for increased government intervention and management is almost always a plus ( not the least because it usually means more high paying jobs for academics as `` advisors '' ) . Also consider that it looks like Denning has some decent NSA / government connections , which is always a plus for an academic institute that wants more government funding and work tossed their way . Despicable , yes ; career limiting , well , the publicity probably outweighs the drawbacks . And there are a whole bunch of people who think the whole thing is just peachy keen .

I do n't know whether anybody formulated and proposed such an index or criteria to determine the magnitude of a genocide as mentioned and advised by Toynbee . If one ever does you will easily see the magnitude of the crime of genocide committed by the Armenians , by massacring an alien population under their rule which constituted about 40 % of their total population and they did it only within a time period of a little over two years in which they enjoyed having full control over this population . Now I would like to ask you : Is there any other genocide in the history of mankind similar to this one ? And again I would like to ask you : Whether the silent and unmourned martyrdom of these hundreds of thousands of Turks of the Republic of Armenia who were exterminated as a `` Final Solution '' to Turco-Tartar problems in Armenia is similar or not to the martyrdom of six million Jews in Europe as a final solution to Jewish problems ?

This involved a gradual dimming of consciousness of the spiritual > world . This was precisely my point . From a theological bent , those who lived immediately after the flood , such as Noah , Ham , his son Cush , and his son Nimrod had a much stronger appreciation of Divine wrath . They also had a stronger understanding of the True God . In fact , this immediacy was a cause of hardship for some , so much so that Atlas , who is seen with heavens resting on his shoulders . But this is not merely the physical heavens that he is lifting . It is to put God and the strict spirituality of His law at a distance , and thus he became the `` Elevator of the heavens . '' This `` god '' made men able to '' feel '' as if heaven were afar off and `` as if either the God of Heaven could not see through the dark cloud , or did not regard with displeasure the breakers of His laws . '' It is interesting to see that it was that was titled `` Emancipator '' or `` Deliverer '' or Phoroneus . It was Nimrod who invaded the patriarchal system and abridged the liberties of mankind , yet was worship for having given many benefits . He was a deliverer all right but not as we think of Christ as a Deliverer . One delivered from a conscious feeling of God 's wrath , the other actually performed a delivery from Gods wrath and it is up to us to accept it as true . > The question of what happens to human beings who died before Christ is > an ever present one with Christians . I am not ready to consign Adam > or Abraham , or even Cain to eternal damnation . I do n't see the problem . From the time of Adam , those who looked forward to the coming `` Anointed One '' and put their faith in the fact that it was God who was to do the provision , were accounted as righteous . But up to the Crucifixion , their sins were only covered , not taken away . Therefore , the dispensation of the Church views the accountability of sin the same , but see it as a completed action . Rom 's makes it clear that it has always been salvation via faith and nothing else . > It is possible to experience eternity in a passing moment . The > relationship of eternity to duration is not simply one of indefinitely > extended conditions of Greenwich mean time . I understand what you 're trying to convey , but I do n't think I 'd lay hold of it because the scriptures do equate the eternality of the second death with the eternality of , say the Church ruling with Christ . Jn 17 tells us what eternal life is exactly , as you are correct that it is much more than non-cessation of consciousness . > It was also a standard belief among many peoples that even the righteous > were lost . It depends upon your def of `` lost . '' The elect were lost only in time as outside of time they had been chosen from the foundation of the world . Existentially we were all born `` lost '' , but the `` righteous '' were `` in Christ '' and therefore never *assuredly* lost . > > It would be interesting to share in the results of your studies of ancient > people 's ideas of life after death .

However , I would say , again I think , that the best lie is one that has an appreciable amount of truth to it . Look at Satan 's twist of God 's Word when he coerced Eve . That is a very interesting study . > The similarity in the midst of great variety of > expression of the different people 's ideas of the time immediately > after death testifies to the presence of an underlying reality . Yes , that is my point . But it is a two edged sword . For some do not want the underlying reality to be revealed . They were not known as `` mystery '' religions for no reason . There was the public side of them and there was the private side , that was so protected that the initiates to an oath of death if they revealed that private side . That is why it is so hard to bring their teachings to light . The `` Mystery of Iniquity '' that we find in the Bible , correlates to this I think . The primary object of the mysteries was to introduce privately , little by little , under the seal of secrecy and sanction of oath , what it would not have been safe to openly profess was the true religion .

No , I disagree with you here Gerry . I know what you 're alluding to in that the church , primarily the RCC , did endorse Aristotelian philosophy into their worldview , but I would disagree with you that it originated in Greece . If you are a student of history , you will come to see that much of what Greece came to expound to the world as their original , was just an adulteration of that which they had taken from conquered countries . The soul is clearly mentioned and discussed at length in the Egyptian religions . As was the unity of God and also the trinity of God . See if you can find Wilkinson 's `` Egyptians . '' He really does a number on what the Greeks did to what they `` pilfered '' from the Egyptians . > He was at once the father of modern thought and at the same > time lived during that darkened time when the perception of our > eternal spiritual being had grown dim .

Each age has its own focus of theology . The early church struggled with the Trinitarian formulation . The reformation dealt with authority . Today , eschatology has had much study . The early creeds do not spell these things out in detail because , 1 ) they were n't the topic of concern , 2 ) there was insufficient wisdom accumulated , 3 ) they did n't have the exegetical tools that we have today . Also , each age seems to have an air of revelation to it . One age has a well tended and cultivated garden in which a particular doctrine is given growth . It would be natural for the end of times to have the garden appropriate for the growth of eschatology , would n't it ? > tangents , never ending tangents , Rex

It states that : > Israel will remain the existing source of authority until `` final status '' is agreed upon ; > Israel will negiotiate the delegation of power to the organs of the Interim Self-Government Arrangements ( ISGA ) ; > The ISGA will apply to the `` Palestinian inhabitants of the territories '' under Israeli military administration . The arrangements will not have a territorial application , nor will they apply to the Israeli population of the territories or to the Palestinian inhabitants of Jerusalem ; > Residual powers not delegated under the ISGA will be reserved by Israel ; > Israelis will continue to live and settle in the territoriesd ; > Israel alone will have responsibility for security in all its aspects- external , internal- and for the maintenance of public order ; > The organs of the ISGA will be of an administrative-functional nature ; > The exercise of powers under the ISGA will be subject to cooperation and coordination with Israel . > Israel will negotiate delegation of powers and responsibilities in the areas of administration , justice , personnel , agriculture , education , business , tourism , labor and social welfare , local police , local transportation and communications , municipal affairs and religious affairs . Several question do come to mind concerning the `` success '' we all hope for in the ongoing negotiation process . These arrangements certainly seem to be essentially a rejection of any Palestinian `` interim '' self-control . Without exposing itself to unwarranted risks and creating irresversible vulnerability , can Israel reasonably put forward ( at later points in the negotiating process ) more `` relaxed '' proposals for this '' interim '' period ? How should proposals ( from either side ) be altered to temper their '' maximalist '' approaches as stated above ? How can Israeli worries , and desire for some `` interim control '' , be addressed while providing for a very *real* interim Palestinian self-governing entity ?

Lines : 40 > If I do n't think my belief is right and everyone else 's belief is wrong , > then I do n't have a belief . This is simply what belief means . Unfortunatly , this seems to be how Christians are taught to think when it comes to their religion . Some take it to the extreme and say that their religion is the ONLY one and if you do n't accept their teachings then you wo n't be `` saved '' . It takes quite a bit of arrogance to claim to know what God thinks/wants . Especially when it 's based upon your interpretation of a book . The logic in the above statement is faulty in that it assumes two people with differing beliefs ca n't both be correct . It 's all about perception . No two people are exactly alike . No two people perceive everything in the same way . I believe that there is one truth . Call it God 's truth , a universal truth , or call it what you will . I do n't believe God presents this truth . I think it is just there and it 's up to you to look for and see it , through prayer , meditation , inspir- ation , dreams or whatever . Just because people may perceive this truth differently , it does n't mean one is wrong and the other is right . As an example , take the question , `` Is the glass half empty or half full '' ? You can have two different answers which are contradictory and yet both are correct . So , for your belief to be true , does not require everyone else 's belief to be wrong . [ If a person has what they believe is convincing evidence that God will save only Christians , it 's hard to see how you can criticize them for arrogance for saying so . It could be that they 're wrong . But I hardly see that it 's arrogance . Let 's look at this a bit closer . Suppose we had some combination of prophets and messiahs that taught us things , but did n't say anything about exclusivity . If we believe them , and then add `` and anybody who believes anything else is damned '' , then you could well criticize us for arrogance . But in this case the exclusivity is in the message as it comes from the prophets , etc . So we could be wrong in believing it , but I do n't see how we can be called arrogant . Maybe the world is n't a soft place . Maybe certain choices actually do have eternal consequences . I can see calling the Christian message arrogant , in a certain sense ( though only in the same sense as calling the law of gravitation arrogant because it does n't give us any option over whether we fall if we jump off a building ) . But not Christians for passing it on , given that they believe it . The complaints I can see making are ( 1 ) that Christians are wrong , or ( 2 ) that God is arrogant . -- clh ]

From : jkjec @ westminster.ac.uk ( Shazad Barlas ) Subject : iterations of the bible Organization : University of Westminster Lines : 53 Hi ... I 'm not a religious guy so dont take this as some kinda flame ( thanx in advance ) I want to know why there are so many different versions of the bible ? There is this version of the bible I have read about and on the front page it says : '' ... .contains inaccurate data and inconsistencies . '' Thanx in advance ... Shaz ... . [ I 'm not sure quite what you mean by many different versions . The primary distinction in versions you see today is in the style of the translation . It 's pretty unusual to see significant differences in meaning . There are a few differences in the underlying text . That 's because before printing , manuscripts were copied by hand . Slight differences resulted . There are enough manuscripts around that scholars can do a pretty good job of recreating the original , but there are some uncertainties . Fortunately , they are generally at the level of minor differences in wording . There are something like 3 or 4 places where whole sentences are involved , but with recent discoveries of older manuscripts , I do n't think there's much uncertainly about those cases . As far as I know , no Christians believe that the process of copying manuscripts or the process of translating is free of error . But I also do n't think there's enough uncertainty in establishing the text or translating it that it has much practical effect . Whether the Bible contains inaccurate data and inconsistences is a hot topic of debate here . Many Christians deny it . Some accept it ( though most would say that the inaccuracies involved are on details that do n't affect the faith ) . But this has nothing to do with there being multiple versions . The supposed inconsistences can be found in all the versions . I 'm surprised to find a reference to this on the title page though . What version are you talking about ? I 've been referring to major scholarly translations . These are what get referenced in postings here and elsewhere . There have certainly been editions that are ( to be kind ) less widely accepted . This includes everything from reconstructions that combine parallel accounts into single narrations , to editions that omit material that the editor objects to for some reason or the other . The copyright on the Bible has long since expired , so there nothing to stop people from making editions that do whatever wierd thing they want . However the editions that are widely used are carefully prepared by groups of scholars from a variety of backgrounds , with lots of crosschecks . I could imagine one of the lesser-known editions claiming to have fixed up all inaccurate data and inconsistencies . But if so , it 's not any edition that 's widely used . The widely used ones leave the text as is . ( Weeeeelllllll , almost as is . It 's been alleged that a few translations have fudged a word or two here and there to minimize inconsistencies . Because translation is not an exact science , there are always going to be differences in opinion over which word is best , I 'm afraid . ) -- clh ]

Lewis ( faq % craft @ uunet.uu.net ) maintains the informative and well written `` comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions '' document . Its focus is on general X information , while this FAQ concentrates on performance . The comp.windows.x FAQ does address the issue of speed , but only with regards to the X server . The gist of that topic seems to be : '' Use X11R5 , it is faster than R4 '' . ( Please see the X FAQ for complete details ) . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Window Managers -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - There are a lot of window managers out there , with lots of different features and abilities . The choice of which to use is by necessity a balancing act between performance and useful features . At this point , most respondents have agreed upon `` twm '' as the best candidate for a speedy window manager . A couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger , is turning off unnecessary things like `` zooming '' and `` opaque move '' . Also , if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner , you reduce the amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping windows . Joe English ( joe @ trystero.art.com ) I 've found that a good font for tiling is 7x13 ( aka : -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal -- 13-100-100-100-c-70-iso8859-1 ) . It is the biggest font I know of that I can use on my Sun ( 1152x900 screen ) and still get two 80 column terminal windows side-by-side on the display with no overlap . Other font suggestions will be accepted . -- -- -- -- -- -- The X Server -- -- -- -- -- -- Which Server ? - - - - - - - Make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware . If you have a monochrome monitor , use a monochrome X11 server . On my Monochrome Sun , I have n't noticed much difference between the Xsun ( colour ) server and XsunMono , however it was pointed out to me that XsunMono is about 800k smaller and therefore should contribute to less paging . [ thanks to : Jonny Farringdon ( j.farringdon @ psychol.ucl.ac.uk ) , Michael Salmon ( Michael.Salmon @ eos.ericsson.se ) ] How your server was compiled can also make a difference . Jeff Law ( law @ schirf.cs.utah.edu ) advises us that on a Sun system , X should be compiled with gcc ( version 2 . * ) or with the unbundled Sun compiler . You can expect to get `` *very* large speedups in the server '' by not using the bundled SunOS compiler . I assume that similar results would occur if you used one of the other high-quality commercial compilers on the market . Locking the Server into RAM ? - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Has anyone tried hacking the X server so that it is locked into RAM and does not get paged ? eg : via a call to plock ( ) . Does this help performance at all ? I 've had one inquiry on this topic , and a few pointers to the plock ( ) function call , but no hard evidence from someone who 's tried it . I am not in a position to give it a try . [ thanks to : Eric C Claeys ( ecc @ eperm.att.com ) , Danny Backx ( db @ sunbim.be ) , Juan D. Martin ( juando @ cnm.us.es ) ] Starting your Server - - - - - - - - - - - Joe English ( joe @ trystero.art.com ) : If you start up a lot of clients in your .xsession or whatever , sleep for a second or two after launching each one . After I changed my .xclients script to do this , logging in actually took *less* time ... we have a heavily loaded system without much core , though . This sounds crazy , but I have confirmed that it works ! Warner Losh ( imp @ Solbourne.COM ) provided me with a good explanation of why this works , which I have summarized here : When you start up an X server it takes a huge amount of time to start accepting connections . A lot of initialization is done by the server when it starts . This process touches a large number of pages . Any other process running at the same time would fight the server for use of the CPU , and more importantly , memory . If you put a sleep in there , you give the Server a chance to get itself sorted out before the clients start up . Similarly , there is also a lot of initialization whenever an X client program starts : toolkits registering widgets , resources being fetched , programs initializing state and `` databases '' and so forth . All this activity is typically memory intensive . Once this initialization is done ( `` The process has reached a steady state '' ) , the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages . By using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your .Xinitrc , you avoid them fighting each other for your workstation 's limited resources This is most definitely a `` Your Mileage May Vary '' situation , as there are so many variables to be considered : available RAM , local swap space , load average , number of users on your system , which clients you are starting , etc . Currently in my .xinitrc I have a situation like : ( sleep 1 ; exec xclock ) & ( sleep 1 ; exec xbiff ) & ( sleep 1 ; exec xterm ) & ( sleep 1 ; exec xterm ) & I 've experimented with : ( sleep 1 ; exec xclock ) & ( sleep 2 ; exec xbiff ) & ( sleep 3 ; exec xterm ) & ( sleep 4 ; exec xterm ) & I 've even tried : ( sleep 2 ; exec start_X_clients_script ) & and then in start_X_clients_script I had : ( sleep 1 ; exec xclock ) & ( sleep 1 ; exec xbiff ) & ( sleep 1 ; exec xterm ) & ( sleep 1 ; exec xterm ) & [ The idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had completely finished processing my .xinitrc , and had settled down into a `` steady state '' before the sleep expired and all my clients were launched . ] All of these yielded fairly comparable results , and so I just stuck with my current setup , for its simplicity . You will probably have to experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you . Fonts - - - Loading fonts takes time and RAM . If you minimize the number of fonts your applications use , you 'll get speed increases in load-up time . One simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts ( one small , one large , one roman , whatever suits you ) and configure all your clients -- or at least all your heavily used clients -- to use only those few fonts . Client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded into the server . This will also conserve server resources , since fewer fonts will be loaded by the server . [ Farrell McKay ( fbm @ ptcburp.ptcbu.oz.au ) , Joe English ( joe @ trystero.art.com ) ] eg : My main xterm font is 7x13 , so I also have twm set up to use 7x13 in all it 's menus and icons etc . Twm 's default font is 8x13 . Since I do n't normally use 8x13 , I 've eliminated one font from my server . Oliver Jones ( oj @ roadrunner.pictel.com ) : Keep fonts local to the workstation , rather than loading them over nfs . If you will make extensive use of R5 scalable fonts , use a font server . About the Resources File - - - - - - - - - - - - - Keep your .Xresources / .Xdefaults file small . Saves RAM and saves on server startup time . Joe English ( joe @ trystero.art.com ) One suggestion : In your .Xdefaults ( .Xresources ) file , try putting only the minimum number of resources that you want to have available to all of your applications . For example : *reverseVideo : true Then , separate your resources into individual client-specific resource files . For example : $ HOME/lib/app-defaults . In your .login file set the environment variable XUSERFILESEARCHPATH : setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH $ HOME/lib/app-defaults/ % N [ The `` comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions '' FAQ contains an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work . -- ed . ] So , when xterm launches , it loads its resources from ... /app-defaults/XTerm . Xdvi finds them in ... /app-defaults/XDvi , and so on and so forth . Note that not all clients follow the same XXxxx resource-file naming pattern . You can check in your system app-defaults directory ( often : /usr/X11R5/lib/X11/app-defaults/ ) to find the proper name , and then name your personal resource files with the same name . This is all documented in the Xt Specification ( pg 125 & 666 ) . [ Thanks to : Kevin Samborn ( samborn @ mtkgc.com ) , Michael Urban ( urban @ cobra.jpl.nasa.gov ) , and Mike Long ( mikel @ ee.cornell.edu ) . Kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers . ] This method of organizing your personal resources has the following benefits : - Easier to maintain / more usable . - Fewer resources are stored in the X server in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property . As a side benefit your server may start fractionally quicker , since it doesn ` t have to load all your resources . - Applications only process their own resources , never have to sort through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them . It also has drawbacks : - the application that you are interested in has to load an additional file every time it starts up . This does n't seem to make that much of a performance difference , and you might consider this a huge boon to usability . If you are modifying an application 's resource database , you just need to re-run the application without having to `` xrdb '' again . - xrdb will by default run your .Xdefaults file through cpp . When your resources are split out into multiple resource files and then loaded by the individual client programs , they will not . WATCH OUT FOR THIS ! ! I had C style comments in my .Xdefaults file , which cpp stripped out . When I switched to this method of distributed resource files I spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why my clients were not finding their resources . Xt did *NOT* provide any error message when it encountered the C style comments in the resource files , it simply , silently , aborted processing the resource file . The loss of preprocessing ( which can be very handy , e.g . `` # ifdef COLOR '' ... ) is enough to cause some people to dismiss this method of resource management . - You may also run into some clients which break the rules . For example , neither Emacs ( 18.58.3 ) nor Xvt ( 1.0 ) will find their resources if they are anywhere other than in .Xdefaults . - when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files with the machine where your resources are stored , your client will not find its resources . Loading all your resources into the server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find their resources . Casey Leedom ( casey @ gauss.llnl.gov ) A possible compromise suggestion that I have ( and am planning on trying ) is to put resources for all my heavily used clients ( eg : xterm ) into my .Xdefaults file , and to use the `` separate resources files '' method for clients that I seldom use . Define Your Display Properly - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server . In that situation , rather than setting your DISPLAY environment variable to `` < hostname > :0.0 '' , where < hostname > is the name of your workstation , you should set your DISPLAY variable to `` unix:0.0 '' or `` :0.0 '' . By doing this you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests . [ thanks to Patrick J Horgan ( pjh70 @ ras.amdahl.com ) ] See the _DISPLAY NAMES_ section of the X ( 1 ) man page for further explanation of how to properly set your display name . `` I do n't think it 's stock MIT , but ( at least ) Data General and HP have libraries that are smart enough to use local communication even when the DISPLAY is n't set specially . '' Rob Sartin ( 88opensi ! sartin @ uunet.UU.NET ) [ Jody Goldberg ( jody @ algorithmics.com ) sent me an Xlib patch to change stock R5 to use local communication even if DISPLAY is not properly set . I do n't want to get in the business of distributing or trying to juggle non-MIT patches and so have elected not to include it here . Hopefully MIT will apply this minor ( ~8 lines ) patch themselves . In the meantime , if you want to try it yourself , email Jody . -- ed . ] -- -- -- - Clients -- -- -- - If you only have a few megabytes of Ram then you should think carefully about the number of programs you are running . Think also about the _kind_ of programs you are running . For example : Is there a smaller clock program than xclock ? Unfortunately , I have n't really noticed that programs advertise how large they are , so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word . [ Suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients ( eg : Xclock , Xterm , Xbiff ) are welcome . -- ed . ] I 've received some contradictory advice from people , on the subject of X client programs . Some advocate the use of programs that are strictly Xlib based , since Xt , Xaw and other toolkits are rather large . Others warn us that other applications which you are using may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries . In this case , using a non-Xt ( for example ) client program may actually _increase_ the amount of RAM consumed . The upshot of all this seems to be : Do n't mix toolkits . That is , try and use just Athena clients , or just Xview clients ( or just Motif clients , etc ) . If you use more than one , then you 're dragging in more than one toolkit library . Know your environment , and think carefully about which client programs would work best together in that environment .

I 've heard that there are versions of xvt with this feature , but I 've not found any yet . UPDATE ( March 1993 ) : I recently had a few email conversations with Brian Warkentin ( brian.warkentine @ eng.sun.com ) regarding xvt . He questions whether xvt really is at all faster than xterm . For instance , xvt may initialize slightly faster , but compare scrolling speed ( try this quickie benchmark : /bin/time dd if=/etc/termcap bs=40 ) and see which program can scroll faster . Also , while xterm may be slightly larger in RAM requirements ( We do n't have any hard numbers here , does anyone else ? ) shared libraries and shared text segments mean that xterm 's paging requirements are not that major . As an experiment , he ripped out all the tek stuff from xterm , but it made little difference , since if you never use it , it never gets brought into memory . So here we stand with some conflicting reports on the validity of xvt over xterm . In summary ? Caveat Emptor , your mileage may vary . If you can provide some hard data , I 'd like to see it .

From Scott Barman ( scott @ asd.com ) comes a suggestion regarding Motif Text Field Widgets : I noticed that during data entry into Motif text field widgets , I was getting a slight lag in response to some keystrokes , particularly the initial one in the field . Examining the what was going on with xscope I found it . It seems that when the resource XmNblinkRate is non-zero and the focus is on a text field widget ( or even just a text widget ) the I-beam cursor will blink . Every time the cursor appears or disappears in those widgets , the widget code is making a request to the server ( CopyArea ) . The user can stop this by setting the resource XmNblinkRate to 0 . It is not noticeable on a 40MHz SPARC , but it does make a little difference on a [ slower system ] . This specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots of areas . Consider your heavily used clients , are there any minor embellishments that can be turned off and thereby save on Server requests ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Miscellaneous Suggestions -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Pretty Pictures - - - - - - - - Do n't use large bitmaps ( GIF 's , etc ) as root window backgrounds . - The more complicated your root window bitmap , the slower the server is at redrawing your screen when you reposition windows ( or redraw , etc ) - These take up RAM , and CPU power . I work on a Sun SPARC and I'm conscious of performance issues , I ca n't comprehend it when I see people with a 4mb Sun 3/60 running xphoon as their root window . I 'll let someone else figure out how much RAM would be occupied by having a full screen root image on a colour workstation . - If you 're anything like me , you need all the screen real estate that you can get for clients , and so rarely see the root window anyway .

I use `` xset m 3 10 '' in my .xinitrc file , which lets me send my pointer across the screen with just a flick of the wrist . See the xset man page for further ideas and information . Hint : sometimes you may want to *slow down* your mouse tracking for fine work . To cover my options , I have placed a number of different mouse setting commands into a menu in my window manager . e.g . ( for twm ) : menu `` mouse settings '' { `` Mouse Settings : '' f.title '' Very Fast '' ! `` xset m 7 10 & '' '' Normal ( Fast ) '' ! `` xset m 3 10 & '' '' System Default ( Un-Accelerated ) '' ! `` xset m default & '' '' Glacial '' ! `` xset m 0 10 & '' } Programming Thoughts - - - - - - - - - - - Joe English ( joe @ trystero.art.com ) : To speed up applications that you 're developing , there are tons of things you can do . Some that stick out : - For Motif programs , do n't set XmFontList resources for individual buttons , labels , lists , et . al . ; use the defaultFontList or labelFontList or whatever resource of the highest-level manager widget . Again , stick to as few fonts as possible . - Better yet , do n't use Motif at all . It 's an absolute pig . - Do n't create and destroy widgets on the fly . Try to reuse them . ( This will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits , too . ) - Use a line width of 0 in GCs . On some servers this makes a HUGE difference . - Compress and collapse multiple Expose events . This can make the difference between a fast application and a completely unusable one . Francois Staes ( frans @ kiwi.uia.ac.be ) : Just a small remark : I once heard that using a better malloc function would greatly increase performance of Xt based applications since they use malloc heavily . They suggested trying out the GNUY malloc , but I did n't find the time yet . I did some tests on small programs just doing malloc and free , and the differences were indeed very noticeable ( somewhat 5 times faster ) [ Any confirmation on this from anyone ? -- ed . ] Andre ' Beck ( Andre_Beck @ IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de ) : - Unnecessary NoExpose Events . Most people use XCopyArea/XCopyPlane as fastest blit routines , but they forget to reset graphics_exposures in the GC used for the blits . This will cause a NoExpose Event every blit , that , in most cases , only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to run through it 's event-loop again and again . - Thousands of XChangeGC requests . This `` Gfx Context Switching '' is also seen in most handcoded X-Apps , where only one or few GCs are created and then heavily changed again and again . Xt uses a definitely better mechanism , by caching and sharing a lot of GCs with all needed parameters . This will remove the load of subsequent XChangeGC requests from the connection ( by moving it toward the client startup phase ) . Say What ! ? - - - - - - Some contributors proposed ideas that seem right off the wall at first : David B. Lewis ( by day : dbl @ osf.org , by night : david % craft @ uunet.uu.net ) : How about this : swap displays with someone else . Run all your programs on the other machine and display locally ; the other user runs off your machine onto the other display . Goal : reduce context switches in the same operation between client and server . I 'm not in a situation where I can easily try this , but I have received the following confirmation ...

Not really a major problem , except that the X11 client and the server are in absolute synchronicity and are context thrashing . Timothy H Panton ( thp @ westhawk.uucp ) : Firstly it relies on the fact that most CPU 's are mostly idle , X's cpu usage is bursty . so the chances of you and your teammate doing something cpu-intensive at the same time is small . If they are not then you get twice the cpu+memory available for your action . The second factor is that context switches are expensive , using 2 cpu 's halves them , you pay a price due to the overhead of going over the network , but this is offset in most cases by the improved buffering of a network ( typically 20k vs 4k for a pipe ) , allowing even fewer context switches . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Other Sources of Information -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Volume 8 in O'Reilly 's X Window System Series , `` X Window System Administrator 's Guide '' is a book all X administrator 's should read .

I think Dyer is reacting because it looks to be yet another case of the same old quackery over and over again . It true that current medical knowledge is limited , but do you realize just HOW MANY quacks exist eager to suck your $ $ $ $ . It 's playing the lottery at best . If the results you got were so clear and obvious , would you mind trying a little experiment to see if it is true ? It would be quite simple . Have sugar pills and have real pills . Take one set for one week and the other set for another week without knowing which ones are the real pills . Then at the end of the 2 weeks compare the results . Let 's say you 're wife would know which are the real ones .

Daevid Bornhuetter-Machen , The Madison Edge '' The main difference between Adolf Hitler and Rush Limbaugh is that Hitler was original and showed initiative . '' -- Mort Sahl on The Tom Snyder Radio Show , ABC Radio Network , October 27 , 1992 . ( NLNS ) -- Believe it or not , I was planning this comparative review of Mein Kampf and Limbaugh 's transcribed rant , The Way Things Ought to Be before Sahl issued his comparative review . As usual , Sahl 's was independent and sharp as a scalpel . My effort can only dream of comparing favorably to Mort 's . At least it has a fairly popular orginating premise ; everyone I 'd mention the idea to thought it was either divinely inspired or at least past due for delivery . Those reactions are based on parallels that should be obvious to the most peripheral observer of the Acts of those False Prophets . Both are noted for their galvanizing oratorical skills , which they both used with passion to generate a political cult of massive numerical proportions ( in fact , Limbaugh claims to have an audience of just over 12 million , almost identical to the number of votes cast for Hitler in the April 1932 German election ) . Both used a myopic social perspective to build the cult , and enthusiastically amputated facts from the record to fabricate their ideological quilt . The last point is glaringly documented by passages in the opening pages of both books . Hitler 's example is when , on page 5 , he claims the German nationalist terrorist Leo Schlageter ( he bombed part of a railway line between Dusseldorf and Duisburg , being caught in the act , in 1923 ) was `` betrayed to France by a representative of his government '' when there has never been any factual foundation for such a statement . In fact , the governments of both the Reich and Prussia , as well as the Vatican , actively intervened to save him from execution , and almost succeeded . Limbaugh follows suit by making the hysterically sarcastic claim in his introduction that `` in a school or during a commencement ceremony or many other public places ... God is unconstitutional . '' Of course , it 's not God but the official imposition of particular concepts of God against an individual 's will that 's unconstitutional . But Limbaugh is too gleeful in his talent for distortion to want you to know that . Of course , one would assume that , by comparing the two books , my main point would be that The Way Things Ought to Be is the modern American Mein Kampf . Not really . At the time of the first German version of Mein Kampf , Hitler was just four months out of prison ( June , 1925 ) , and trying to reorganize the Nazis . He used the book to build his dozen million followers . Limbaugh , on the other hand , came up with his book after building his dozen million . Twelve million went a longer way in Weimar Germany that it does in the Republicrat United States . Thus , the more accurate parallels would be that Limbaugh 's daily three-hour radio show is the American Mein Kampf , the primary propoganda tool used to pump up the angry volume ; and that The Way Things Ought to Be is actually the American Triumph of the Will , a translation of the same fascist message into a different medium . Also , the printed word was the more important medium in Weimar Germany , since radio was still being thought of by impoverished Germans as a medium of luxury in 1925 . Today , on the other hand , Americans are more likely to spend a few seconds to tune a radio dial at no monetary charge than drop $ 22 for 304 pages of transcripts of the same words . But , as Mort Sahl also observed on the radio the other night , some cloutmeister of the radical right wants Limbaugh to be a focal point of their propoganda . ( And remember , Sahl is an Al Haig conservative these days . ) Mort might not know exactly who Rush 's equivalent of Rodolf Hess is ( the book itself suggests Ed McLaughlin , the former president of ABC radio and now Limbaugh 's partner in EFM Media , the radio program 's production company ) . But Mort himself is a veteran of the talk show , having hosted them in New York , Washington and Los Angeles . He knows what evil lurks in the hearts of major market media men . He knows that Limbaugh could not have collected his audience had not the opportunity been placed on a silver platter and handed to him . Limbaugh earns his money just as honestly as Al Capone did ; it 's almost worthy of a RICO indictment . On questions of social issues , there is an overabundance of material in the Limbaugh book that seems to echo Hitler 's venom . For example : On Their Own Qualifications to Control Society Hitler : `` Out of the host of sometimes millions of people , who individually more or less clearly and distinctly guess the truth , partly perhaps understand it , one man [ author 's emphasis ] must step forward in order to form , with apodeictic force , out of the wavering world of imagination of the great masses , granite principles , and to take up the fight for their sole correctness , until out of the playing waves of a free world of thought a brazen rock of uniform combination of form and will arises '' ( page 577 ) . Limbaugh : `` Who needs the media when they 've got me ? ... The show is devoted exclusively to what I think ... [ the phrase `` with half my brain tied behind my back to make it even '' ] denotes the egress of mental aptitude I require to engage and demolish liberals and others who disagree with me ... It might take four or five years , but I 'm convinced The Media will slowly and reluctantly come around to my way of thinking , kicking and screaming all the way . '' ( pages 266 , 21 , 299 and 273 , respectively . ) On Religion as the Basis of a Nation Hitler : `` In this world human culture and civilization are inseperably bound up with the existence of the Aryan . His dying-off or his decline would again lower upon this earth the dark veils of a time without culture ... He who dares to lay hand upon the highest image of the Lord sins against the benevolent Creator of this miracle and helps in the expulsion from Paradise . '' ( Page 581 . ) Limbaugh : `` America was founded as a Judeo-Christian country ... But our intellectual and political elites are often either hostile or ambivalent toward religion ... People for whom belief in God is at best a charming superstition have managed to ban prayer from the public schools for the last thirty years . Is it only a coincidence that the quality of American education has declined ever since ? '' ( pages 274-5 . ) On Popular Culture as a Reason for Social Collapse Hitler : `` The fight against the poisoning of the soul has to set in ... One has only to look at the menus of our movie houses , vaudevilles and theatres ; and one can hardly deny that this is not the right kind of food ... Theatre , art , literature , movies , the press , billposters and window displays must be cleaned of the symptoms of a rotting world and put into the service of a moral idea of State and culture . '' ( pages 346 and 348 . ) Limbaugh : `` Today , Hollywood is in trouble . The reason [ is ] that Hollywood has forgotten who its audience is ... They make fun of people who believe in God . They ridicule the traditional family , heterosexuality and monagamy . They disparage American heroes . '' ( page 254 . ) On the News Meida Hitler : `` The activity of the so-called liberal press was the work of gravediggers for the German people and the German Reich . One can pass by in silence the Marxist papers of lies ... it 's task is only to break the people 's folkish and national spine , in order to make it ripe for the yoke of slavery of international capital and its masters , the Jews . '' ( Page 331 . ) Limbaugh : `` Elements of The Media have jumped on the bandwagon of leftist causes . The cynical journalist of the past has been replaced in many cases by an enthusiastic cheerleader for causes ... During the Gulf war , CNN correspondent Bernard Shaw [ said ] CNN is a global network . We ca n't take sides . Cant take sides ? -- - -- - -- - ! ... If they do n't realize that their freedom lies in the United States of America and that therefore they should defend this nation , they are hopelessly misguided and , may I suggest , flirting with megalomania . '' ( pages 270 and 268 . ) * * * To continue these comparative excerpts is certainly possible , but ultimately too depressing to take in one reading . After putting these books down , there is one undeniable fact that haunts me . In the 1920s , Adolf Hitler fed depressed and frightened Germans the opiate of hatred of those around them ; in turn , it allowed Germans to hand their collective national power to the Nazis . In the 1990s , Rush Limbaugh is doing the very same thing : distributing hatred to depressed and frightened Americans ; in turn , it is helping the American radical right to maintain its power base as the 12-year nightmare of the Reagan-Bush era comes to an end , hoping to rebuild it into their hopes for The Fascist States of America . And if Limbaugh is not as repellant a Hitler , it is only because the radical right utilizes Limbaugh as its own gateway opiate . One can only wonder what the ultimate drug is they plan to hook America on . The Madison Edge can be reached at PO Box 845 , Madison , WI 53701- 0845 ; ( 608 ) 255-4460 . -- - 30 -- -

Some people are concerned about the chemicals that the body produces when it degrades nutrasweet . It is thought to form formaldehyde and known to for methanol in the degredation pathway that the body uses to eliminate substances . The real issue is whether the levels of methanol and formaldehyde produced are high enough to cause significant damage , as both are toxic to living cells . All I can say is that I will not consume it . Phenylalanine is nothing for you to worry about . It is an amino acid , and everyone uses small quantities of it for protein synthesis in the body . Some people have a disease known as phenylketoneurea , and they are missing the enzyme necessary to degrade this compound and eliminate it from the body . For them , it will accumulate in the body , and in high levels this is toxic to growing nerve cells . Therefore , it is Only a major problem in young children ( until around age 10 or so ) or women who are pregnant and have this disorder . It used to be a leading cause of brain damage in infants , but now it can be easily detected at birth , and then one must simply avoid comsumption of phenylalanine as a child , or when pregnant . -heather

It has been reported previously and there is a fix . Apparantly the problem only occurs when TAB characters are used immediately preceding the equation frame . The work around when equations are expected to touch the right margin is to delete at least one preceding TAB and use SPACE to align the frame ( or use set frame where placed w/no text wrap around ) . Unforutnately , once the page run-on has occured you are hosed . So the moral of the story is use only SPACE characters to align equation frames .

He showed a lot of concentration at the plate in his rookie year . 4 ) Walk : Well , he seems to be on the losing end tonight . BUt I still think that Walk desrved his contract . 5 ) Leyland should accept a part of the blame for the LaValliere situation . I ca n't understand his and management 's fear of losing Tom Prince through waivers . Even if they do , what 's the use . He is aright hander like Slaught . Not a very smart platoon . Also , I am blaming Leyland in this case , since he is hcurrently convinced that LaVAlliere is through , while giving him way too much time last year in the regular season AND the playoffs ( SLaught should have played in all 7 games ; he has a good average against right handed pitching ) . Did n't Leyland and Simmons forsee this last year , and attempt to trade LaValliere last year itself ? Any fool could tell them LaVAlliere was n't very fit last year . 6 ) Dennis MOeller is SCARY ! ! ! 7 ) Candeleria : Well , he is not going to have such a high ERA at the end of the season . Maybe it will be in 3-4 range . BUt $ 1 million plus ? Come on . Other than the customary home run giving stage Patterson goes through for a few weeks , Patterson has served the PIrates very well each year . So far , he seems to have pitched well for the Rangers . I think the PIrates should have spent the money on Patterson in stead . 8 ) The Rookie batters : Well , Young has surprised me a bit with his instant impact . Other than that , their excellent performance has n't been too much of a surprise . I think we should thank Doughty for that . 9 ) Rookie Pitchers : Worse than expected , especially Cooke . 10 ) Slaught : How come he was n't given a contract extension last year ? NOw his value has increased immensely . 11 ) Lonnie Smith ! ! Well , Eric Davis was signed for a comparable amount . Let 's see . Eric can hit better . He can run better . He can field better . Now why didnt the PIrates go after Eric Davis . An injured Davis is better than a healthy Lonnie Smith . Even if Lonnnie Smith gets some big hits this year , he wo n't be an asset . He has looked terrible on the bases and in the field . 12 ) Management : BIG BIG ZERO . Sauer has yet to make a forceful agreement in favor of revenue sharing . He seems more concerned about pleasing that idiot Danforth by preparing the team for a move to Tampa Bay . 13 ) Alex Cole fiasco . The PIrates infield and CF positions look good . The RF and LF would have looked good if we could have gotten Cole to replace two of the four outfielders . Eric Davis , Van Slyke and Cole would have made a very respectable outfield . Even without Eric Davis , thye PIrates would have a respectable outfield with Cole , SVan Slyke , and Merced ( I think he should hit left handed against lefts in stead of switch hitting ) . Simmons did have options for the outfield . Ironically , the biggest accomplishment of Simmon 's tenure was getting Alex Cole really cheap . Too bad . 14 ) Compensatory draft picks for Bonds : Forget it . The pirates can rant and rave . they will not get those picks . As of now , the issue is still being appealed . Now , if this doesnt convince anyone that Simmons and Sauer are idiots , nothing else will . On a final note . Tim Wakefield wo n't be as awful as he was in his last 2 starts . BUt do n't count on him pitching like last year for the rest of the season . Also , if the Pirates are in contention towards rthe end of the season , they will miss Redus 's clutch hitting and his speed ( he has peaked in the second half of the last 2 seasons ) > -Pravin Ratnam

This is a good point . Christ was hardly the only person who claimed to be the Messiah -- in fact , a number of `` Messiahs '' were active in the area from the time of the Roman conquest to after the fall of Masada . Many of the statements made by the apostles -- especially their repeated attempts to give Jesus a sword ( give him military power ) point to the fact that they did n't realize the true nature of his reign until after the fact . Many of the statements in the Bible can be seen as being oriented toward explaining this new definition of `` Messiah '' to the Jews who were being preached to .

After watching Giants hitters struggle last year , Barry 's swing was very impressive -- he 's very quick and his swing seems effortless , even compared to Clark ( particularly Clark as of late ) . It was interesting to see Bonds hit Maddux so well . I 'm not sure if Barry was after revenge against the Braves or what but he stroked three very pretty hits ( 1b , 2b , hr ) for 5 rbi 's . The Giants as a team are doing a lot of surprising things this year in addition to Bonds . There has been some good pitching and some hitters seem to be swinging much better . Clayton 's defense has been superb . McGee seems to like leading off this year . Manwaring is driving the ball . So on & so forth . I hope it continues ... I think they need to continue well into June before people are really sold that they are for real -- particularly the pitching . For myself , I think the fresh start of Magowan/Baker/etc has really wiped out a lot of negatives from the last few years and will be a real factor in helping them significantly improve over last year .

I got all sorts of responses , from `` marry her '' to `` have nothing ever to do with her again '' Through reading the Bible and through a lot of prayer , here is what I have decided to do . I sent her a letter today . First , i told her that if she was really serious about moving away from home to another state that `` I would do anything to get you here in NC . '' I told her that I tried to find out if there were any new stores planning to be built -- -but they would n't tell me . About her marraige comment ( I 'm not gon na call it a proposal , cause I still do n't know if it was a total joke or not ) I more or less said that `` Marry me ? ? Well , get transferred to NC first and then we 'll talk : ) : ) '' Hopefully , what i said could be interpreted either way . Needless to say , there has been a lot of praying over this ... I have done a lot of reading about marraige from the Bible . If she was dead serious about getting married -- -I would n't do it yet simply b/c she is not ( as far as I know to this point ) a Christian . It just would n't work w/o God in the marraige as well . I figure that if God wanrs this to go through -- he 's kept us in touch for 10 years now -- -he can handle one more . If God wants it to happen , it will happen ! She will be in NC in June meetinf some relatives so I 'll get to see her ... and I 'll get a letter from her befoe then so I know more of what to look forward to . I guess all I can do now is wait and pray . I have decided not to tell my folks until I 'm totally sure what is going on . I do ask that everyone that wrote me to please keep this situation in your prayers.. Finally , I would like to thank EVERYONE who wrote in ... If you have anything else for me ...

[ Honestly . ] The word of Sin is Restriction . [ Would I kid you ? ] Does one man 's words encompass the majestic vision of thousands of individuals ? Quoting a man is not the same as quoting the Order . Taken out of context , words can be interpreted much differently than had one applied them within the confines of their original expression . I think this is the case regarding Hymenaeus Beta , Frater Superior of the Order to which I belong . When he included that bit from Merlinus X ' he did us all a service . He showed us the extremes to which Order members have been known to go in their fervor . I have little knowledge regarding Reuss ' background , but surely he was an unusual man , and he was an important force in the Order for many years . Yet as people change so do Orders change , and while we look back so carefully at the dirty laundry of O.T.O . remember that this is only the surface skim and that many perspectives are now encompassed which extend beyond any one individual . I hope to show that there was and is much room for a difference of opinion within the Order itself , perhaps by testing the limits myself . Let us examine this issue a bit more closely ... . '' In 1895 , Karl Kellner ( 1850-1905 ) , a wealthy Austrian industrialist and paper chemist , as well as a high-grade Mason , founded the Ordo Templi Orientis . Kellner had traveled widely in the East , where he met three adepts who instructed him specific magical practices . Kellner 's efforts to develop the Order were later assisted by Franz Hartmann , Heinrich Klein and Theodore Reuss , who had worked together prior to joining the O.T.O . The Order was first proclaimed in 1902 in Reuss 's Masonic publication , 'Oriflamme ' . On Kellner 's death , Reuss succeeded him as Outer Head [ O.H.O. ] . The 'Jubilee ' edition of the 'Oriflamme ' , published in 1912 , announced that the Order taught secret of sexual magic . `` Theodore Reuss was an interesting character . Born June 28 , 1855 in Augsburg , he entered Masonry in 1876 . He was a singer , journalist and possibly a spy for the Prussian political police , infiltrating the Socialist League founded by Karl Marx 's daughter and her husband . Reuss was later associated with William Wynn Westcott , a leader of the Golden Dawn , who later introduced him to John Yarker . Yarker chartered Reuss to found the Rites of Memphis and Mizraim in Germany . After several attempts to concretize various Masonic Rites , Reuss settled on the development of the O.T.O . `` The Order experienced reasonably steady growth under Reuss ' leadership . For example , he chartered Papus in France , Rudolph Steiner in Berlin and H. Spencer Lewis in the USA . In 1912 , the historic meeting between Reuss and Crowley occurred . Crowley wrote that Reuss came to him and accused him of revealing Order secrets . When Crowley looked at it afresh , the initiated interpretation of sexual magick unfolded itself to him for the first time . Reuss appointed Crowley as Supreme and Holy King of all the English speaking world , and it was this authorization that he invoked when publishing the material of the Equinox . `` Reuss resigned as Outer Head of the Order in 1922 after suffering a stroke and named Crowley his successor . All was well until 1925 when _The Book of the Law_ was translated into German . There was a break in the continuity of the Order . Manyk members split with the new O.H.O . over the book , which Crowley was actively promulgating through the Order . He had earlier revise dthe Order rituals at Reuss 's request , deeply infusing the doctrines of the New Aeon revelation . '' _An Introduction to the History of the O.T.O._ , by Ad Veritatem IX' Within _Equinox III:10_ , Edited by Hymenaeus Beta , Frater Superior , Rex Summus Sanctissimus , Caliph of the United States of America , Published by Samuel Weiser , 1990 . There are many possible reasons that our Frater Superior included this material in _Equinox III:10_ . And this is the real point , is it not ? Why did he wish to publish such things about the history of his own organization ? Does he represent a dogmatic threat to the principle of Thelema ? Or is he exercising his True Will and putting forth very complex pictures with no easy answers ? A picture which leaves room for very many interpretations . It is quite easy for me to see , for example , that all of O.T.O . derived out of the dribble of faltering Masonry , purchased by clever hucksters with an ounce of courage and some writing ability to aid them . And I can take that all the way down to our present Caliph , whose feeble support of the 'Law of Thelema ' is laughable at best . Would I be thrown out of the Order for speaking in this way ? Will I ? I think not . Why ? Because my Frater will see it as a perspective , an interjection I am using as an example . My illustration shows that we may express things in the context of a larger work and the true significance of this may be quite difficult to apprehend at first . So it may be with OTO and Merlinus X ' . Please look O.T.O . more carefully . I do not support Reuss 's words myself , as I am not qualified to assess them , and I am critical of their pomposity . If I who am a member of the Order take such a stand and am allowed to continue doing so , then what can this say about the health of the Order ? Does it mean that the Order has 'gone soft ' and abandoned its moral principles ? Or does it mean that it is strong in its ability to let the will of universal kinship arise on its own , not shackled by some dogmatic requirement ? How shall we resolve these two possibilities ? I find a high calibre of individual associated with Ordo Templi Orientis . They are often quite intelligent and sometimes very well versed in arcane or usual information . They are quite often artists and geniuses . Having met some 20 longstanding members in the SF Bay Area ( many who are or were very heavily involved with the Order ) , I can vouch for the integrity of the organization as it stands . I have sometimes questioned the policy of Hymenaeus Beta . In these moments I followed my intuition , and I 've found little to stop me from requesting a Second initiation from a different O.T.O . body . I 'm happily participating in social groups ( Feasts or Initiations ) and have come to know the Gnostic Mass well enough for my tastes . This does n't make me an authority on Order politics and explanations , however . I can only hypothesize and relay to you what I understand based on my limited contact with other members . I urge you not to take the words of Merlinus X too far . There are many ways to interpret words , and many people who have become involved with the Order feel very strongly about the sanctity of personal freedom and the preservation of individual vision . I welcome other comment on this issue and will be writing more in response to other posts in this thread . Invoke me under my stars . Love is the law , love under will . I am I !

Your mileage may vary . Yes I fully agree with that , but is it `` I do n't believe gods exist '' , or '' I believe no gods exist '' ? As MANDTBACKA @ FINABO.ABO.FI ( Mats Andtbacka ) pointed out , it all hinges on what you take the word `` believe '' to mean . Unfortunately this is bound up in the definitions of strong and weak atheism , at least according to the FAQ : # Atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God . # Some atheists go further , and believe that God does not exist . The former is # often referred to as the `` weak atheist '' position , and the latter as `` strong # atheism '' . # # It is important to note the difference between these two positions . `` Weak # atheism '' is simple scepticism ; disbelief in the existence of God . `` Strong # atheism '' is a positive belief that God does not exist . Please do not # fall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are `` strong atheists '' . ( From mathew 's `` An Introduction to Atheism '' version 1.2 last modified 5-Apr-93 ) Should the FAQ be clarified to try to pin down this notion of `` belief '' ?

From : baez @ guitar.ucr.edu ( john baez ) Subject : End of the Space Age Article-I.D . : galaxy.29034 Organization : University of California , Riverside Lines : 82 Nntp-Posting-Host : guitar.ucr.edu There is an interesting opinion piece in the business section of today's LA Times ( Thursday April 15 , 1993 , p. D1 ) . I thought I 'd post it to stir up some flame wars - I mean reasoned debate . Let me preface it by saying that I largely agree that the `` Space Age '' in the romantic sense of several decades ago is over , and that projects like the space station miss the point at this time . Reading , for example , `` What 's New '' - the weekly physics update we get here on the net - it 's clear that the romance of the day lies in the ever more fine-grained manipulation of matter : by which I include biotechnology , condensed matter physics ( with its spinoffs in computer hardware and elsewhere ) , and the amazing things people are doing with individual atoms these days . To a large extent , I think , the romance some people still have with space is a matter of nostalgia . I feel sure that someday we - or more precisely , our `` mind children '' - will spread across space ( unless we wipe ourselves out ) ; but I think that *manned* space exploration is not what is exciting about what we can do *now* . Anyway , let me quote some of this article , but not all ... SPACE AGE GLORY FADES FROM VIEW Micheal Schrage ( writer , consultant , and research associate at MIT ) At 35 , America 's Space Age wo n't have to suffer through the angst of a midlife crisis . The reason is that the Space Age is already dead . The technologies no longer define our times , and the public has grown weary of the multibillion -dollar celestial investments that yield minimal psychic or economic rewards . Space exploration has mutated from a central focuse of America 's science and technology debate into a peripheral issue . Speace is not a meaningful part of the ongoing industrial competitiveness debate , our technology infrastructure discussions or even our defense conversion policy . To be sure , America should continue to invest in satellite technologies for telecommunications and remote sensing - cheap deep-space probes would be nice too - but the ideal of space as a meaningful driver of scientific and industrial innovation is now dead . ... .. Before the change in administrations , it would have been foolish to write an obituary for the Space Age . The Bush White House aggressively supported the space program and proposed spending well over $ 30 billion to build space station Freedom alone . Even as he proposed budget cuts in other science and technology domains , Office of Management and Budget Director Richard Darman was an outspoken public champion of big-ticket space expenditures . The reality that much of the civilian space program - from the shuttle to the Hubble telescope to the space station - was poorly conceived and unimpressively implemented did not seem to matter much . Political inertia and a nostalgic sense of futurism - not a coherent vision or cost-effective sensibilities - determined multibillion-dollar space budgets . Indeed , with few notable exceptions , such as Voyager , the post-Apollo era is the story of the gold-plated porkification of space exploration with programs and promises that delivered less for more and more . ... ... While the Clinton Administration has kept on the highly regarded Daniel Goldin as administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration , it seems clear that space exploration is not being positioned as either a symbolic or substantive centerpiece of America's technological prowess . The space station budget has - rightly - been slashed . Space is virtually ignored when the Administration champions its competitiveness agenda . ... ... '' I wish this had happened 10 years ago instead of starting to happen now , '' says Bruce Murray , a Caltech professor who ran NASA 's Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena . `` We 've put off a lot of things we shouldn't have ... . I would rather see a $ 10-billion NASA doing well than a $ 40-billion one filled with white elephants . ''

This a `` tried and true '' method utilized by guerilla and terrorists groups : to conduct operations in the midst of the local populace , thus forcing the opposing `` state '' to possible harm innocent civilians in their search or , in order to avoid the deaths of civilians , abandon the search . Certainly the people who use the population for cover are *also* to blaim for dragging the innocent civilians into harm 's way . Are you suggesting that , when guerillas use the population for cover , Israel should totally back down ? So ... the easiest way to get away with attacking another is to use an innocent as a shield and hope that the other respects innocent lives ? > If Israel insists that > the so called `` Security Zone '' is necessary for the protection of > Northern Israel , than it will have to pay the price of its occupation > with the blood of its soldiers . Your damn right Israel insists on some sort of `` demilitarized '' or `` buffer '' zone . Its had to put up with too many years of attacks from the territory of Arab states and watched as the states did nothing . It is not exactly surprizing that Israel decided that the only way to stop such actions is to do it themselves . > If Israel is interested in peace , than it should withdraw from OUR land . What ? So the whole bit about attacks on Israel from neighboring Arab states can start all over again ? While I also hope for this to happen , it will only occur WHEN Arab states show that they are *prepared* to take on the responsibility and the duty to stop guerilla attacks on Israel from their soil . They have to Prove it ( or provide some `` guaratees '' ) , there is no way Israel is going to accept their `` word '' - not with their past attitude of tolerance towards `` anti-Israel guerillas in-residence '' . > > I have written before on this very newsgroup , that the only > real solution will come as a result of a comprehensive peace > settlement whereby Israel withdraws to its own borders and > peace keeping troops are stationed along the border to insure > no one on either side of the border is shelled . Good lord , Brad . What in the world goves you the idea that UN troops stop anything ? They are ONLY stationed in a country because that country allows them in . It can ask them to leave *at any time* ; as Nasser did in '56 and '67 . Somehow , with that `` limitation '' on the troops `` powers '' I don't think that Israel is going to be any more comfortable . Without a *genuine* commitment to peace from the Arab states , and concrete ( not intellectual or political exercises in jargon ) `` guarantees '' by other parties , the UN is worthless to Israel ( but , perhaps useful as a `` ruse '' ? ) . > This is the only realistic solution , it is time for Israel to > realize that the concept of a `` buffer zone '' aimed at protecting > its northern cities has failed . In fact it has caused much more > Israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israel > would have resulted in . Perhaps you are aware that , to most communities of people , there is the feeling that it is better that `` many of us die fighting against those who attack us than for few to die while we silently accept our fate . '' If , however , you call on Israel to see the sense of suffering fewer casualties , I suggest you apply the same to Palestinian , Arab and Islamic groups . > If Israel really wants to save some Israeli lives it would withdraw > unilaterally from the so-called `` Security Zone '' before the conclusion > of the peace talks . Such a move would save Israeli lives , > advance peace efforts , give Israel a great moral lift , better Israel 's > public image abroad and give it an edge in the peace negociations > since Israel can rightly claim that it is genuinely interested in > peace and has already offered some important concessions . > Along with such a withdrawal Israel could demand that Hizbollah > be disarmed by the Lebanese government and warn that it will not > accept any attacks against its northern cities and that if such a > shelling occurs than it will consider re-taking the buffer zone > and will hold the Lebanese and Syrian government responsible for it . From Israel 's perspective , `` concessions '' gets it NOTHING ... except the realization that it has given `` something '' up and now *can only hope* that the other side decides to do likewise . Words *can be taken back* by merely doing so ; to `` take back '' tangible items ( land , control of land ) requires the sort of action you say Israel should stay away from . Israel put up with attacks from Arab state territories for decades before essentially putting a stop to it through its invasion of Lebanon . The entire basis of that reality was exactly as you state above : 1 ) Israel would express outrage at these attacks and protest to the Arab state involved , 2 ) that state promptly ignored the entire matter , secure in the knowledge that IT could not be held responsible for the acts committed by `` private groups '' , 3 ) Israel would prepare for the next round of attacks . What would Israel want to return to those days ( and do n't be so idiotic as to suggest `` trust '' for the motivations of present-day Arab states ) ? > There seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese > goovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such > circumstances , > Ah , ok ... what is `` different '' about the present situation that tells us that the Arab states will *not* pursue their past antagonistic policies towards Israel ? Now , do n't talk about vague `` political factors '' but about those `` tangible '' ( just like that which Israel gave up ) factors that `` guarantee '' the responsibility of those states . Your assessment of `` difference '' here is based on a whole lot of assumptions , and most states do n't feel confortable basing their existence on that sort of thing . > and now the Lebanese government has proven that it is > capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did > in all other parts of Lebanon . > > Basil It has not . Without the support , and active involvement , of Syria , Lebanon would not have been able to accomplish all that has occurred . Once Syria leaves who is to say that Lebanon will be able to retain control ? If Syria stays thay may be even more dangerous for Israel . > Tim Your view of this entire matter is far too serenely one-sided and selectively naive .

While I 'll agree that these are generally held to be `` good things '' , I question whether they come very close to being objective values . Especially considering that at one time or another each has been viewed as being undesirable . I doubt you could even come up with anything that could be said to be universally `` good '' or `` bad '' . And when I referred to `` the truth '' I was using the term hypothetically , realizing full well that there may not even be such a thing . > # Assuming , for the moment , that morals _are_ relative , then two > # relativists can recognize that neither has a lock on the absolute > # truth and they can proceed to negotiate a workable compromise that > # produces the desired results . > > No they can not , because they acknowledge up front that THE desired > results do not exist .

After all , if morals are relative , these values > can not *meaningfully* be said to be incorrect . True enough . But they can not be said to be anything more than personal morals . One thing notably lacking in most extremists is any sense of _personal_ accountability - the justification for any socially unacceptable behaviour is invariably some `` higher authority '' ( aka , absolute moral truth ) . > # Assuming that there is an absolute morality , two disagreeing > # objectivists can either be both wrong or just one of them right ; there > # is no room for compromise . Once you beleive in absolute morals , > # you must accept that you are amoral or that everyone who disagrees > # with you is amoral . > > Untrue .

In the same way , I can believe in an objective reality > without claiming to know the mechanism for quantum collapse , or who shot > JFK . An objective truth that says one can not know the objective truth ? Interesting notion . : - ) Certainly one can have as one 's morals a belief that compromise is good . But to compromise on the absolute truth is not something most people do very successfully . I suppose one could hold compromise as being an absolute moral , but then what happens when someone else insists on no compromise ? How do you compromise on compromising ? > # Given a choice between a peaceful compromise or endless contention , > # I 'd say that compromise seems to be `` better '' . > > And I would agree .

I 'm looking for a way to say > '' yes '' to that question , and relativism is n't it . Almost invariably when considering the relative value of one thing over another , be it morals or consequences , people only consider those aspects which justify a desired action or belief . In justifying a commitement to peace I might argue that it lets people live long & healthy and peaceful lives . While that much may well be true , it is incomplete in ignoring the benefits of war - killing off the most agressive member of society , trimming down the population , stimulating production . The equation is always more complex than presented .

INTRODUCTION A wide variety of images , data , catalogs , information releases , and other material dealing with space and astronomy may be found on the net . A few sites offer direct dialup access or remote login access , while the remainder support some form of file transfer . Many sites are listed as providing 'anonymous FTP ' . This refers to the File Transfer Protocol on the Internet . Sites not connected to the Internet can not use FTP directly , but there are a few automated FTP servers which operates via email . Send mail containing only the word HELP to ftpmail @ decwrl.dec.com or bitftp @ pucc.princeton.edu , and the servers will send you instructions on how to make requests . The sources with the broadest selection of material are the NASA Ames SPACE archive and the National Space Science Data Center . Do n't even ask for images to be posted to the net . The data volume is huge and nobody wants to spend the time on it . VIEWING IMAGES The possible combinations of image formats and machines is forebodingly large , and I wo n't attempt to cover common formats ( GIF , etc . ) here . To read PDS and VICAR ( and many other ) formats on Unix systems running X , use XV 2.11 , available by anonymous FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu ( 18.24.0.12 ) in contrib/xv-2.11.tar.Z and the other standard X11 FTP sites . The FAQ for the Usenet group alt.binaries.pictures discusses image formats and how to get image viewing software . A copy of this document is available by anonymous FTP from the Usenet FAQ archives at pit-manager.mit.edu ( 18.72.1.58 ) , in directory pub/usenet/alt.binaries.pictures . ONLINE ARCHIVES NASA AMES Extensive archives are maintained at NASA Ames and are available via anonymous FTP or an email server . These archives include many images and a wide variety of documents including this FAQ list , NASA press releases , shuttle launch advisories , and mission status reports . Please note that these are NOT maintained on an official basis . FTP users should connect to ames.arc.nasa.gov ( 128.102.18.3 ) and look in pub/SPACE . pub/SPACE/Index contains a listing of files available in the archive ( the index is about 200K by itself ) . To access the archives by email , send a letter to archive-server @ ames.arc.nasa.gov ( or ames ! archive-server ) . In the subject of your letter ( or in the body ) , use commands like : send SPACE Index send SPACE SHUTTLE/ss01.23.91 . The capitalization of the subdirectory names is important . All are in caps . Only text files are handled by the email server at present ; use one of the FTP email servers described in the introduction to this section for images or programs . The Magellan Venus and Voyager Jupiter , Saturn , and Uranus CD-ROM image disks have been put online in the CDROM and CDROM2 directories . The disks will be rotated on a weekly basis . Thousands of images are available in these collections . The GIF directory contains images in GIF format . The VICAR directory contains Magellan images in VICAR format ( these are also available in the GIF directory ) . A PC program capable of displaying these files is found in the IMDISP directory ( see the item `` VIEWING IMAGES '' below ) . The NASA media guide describes the various NASA centers and how to contact their public affairs officers ; this may be useful when pursuing specific information . It 's in MISC/media.guide . Any problems with the archive server should be reported to Peter Yee ( yee @ ames.arc.nasa.gov ) . NASA ASTROPHYSICS DATA SYSTEM The ADS is a distributed data retrieval system which is easy to use and provides uniform access to ground-based and space-based astronomy data from NASA data centers across the country . It currently has over 140 data catalogs of radio , infrared , optical , UV , and X-ray data which can be queried by position or any other parameter in the catalog . The ADS also provides tools to manipulate and plot tabular results . In addition , ADS has a Beta version of an Abstracts Service which allows users to query over 125,000 abstracts of astronomy papers since 1975 by authors , keywords , title words , or abstract text words . ADS use requires direct Internet access . For more info and to sign up to become a user , email ads @ cuads.coloradu.edu .

Those who forward offensive posts to the sysadmin are n't curtailing anyones ' freedom of speech . The neo-nazi movement has a right to make speeches , say anything they want . They do not have a right to have these speeches published by the N.Y. Times . That depends on the Times analysis of the economic and to somewhat extent newsworthy value of those speeches . Likewise to the sysadmin of this fellows system . If he feels his resources are being used in a manner that is not in his best interests , or are perhaps embarassing to his organization , he will act just as the New York Times does , not to be a conduit for these ideas . The poster is after all free-loading off of someone else's pocket book when he posts . He who controls the purse strings has the right to make the decision how he wants those funds spent or not spent . Noone is going to put the poster in jail , unless he bombs a local building as a symbol of his hatred . Freedom of Speech in no way equates to accessibility to conduits of information . The market of ideas has its own `` natural selection '' process that weeds out the ga-ga from the credible ideas that are of importance .

What > stupidity gene makes this so difficult ? `` I 'd like to buy the world a > clue ... '' The word that is missing in this whole discourse is not the `` B '' word , or the `` H '' word , or even the `` N '' or `` W '' words . It is the `` L '' word - LOSER ! ! That 's right . When we boil all the crap out of this argument , it is all about WINNING and LOSING , and nothing else . Let me explain . Remember the eighties ? No excuses . Nobody who can handle a mail buffer can claim they are `` too young '' to remember Ronald Reagan - yet . The eighties were about `` How America Learned to Win Once Again '' . Then ( would n't you know ) , we won so well that there was nothing left to win . No Cold War to endure . No nuclear holocaust . No more worlds to conquer ( We forgot about outer space long ago ) . The kind of overwhelming , no holds barred success that killed Alexander the Great . Yes , there were a few `` little '' problems along the way - stock market meltdown here , an S & L bailout there , a few revolts and crazy Middle Eastern dictators to contend with , but as Tacitus would tell ya ' , the God Augustus never had it so good . In the meantime , there is guilt for winning , maybe a fear that one does n't deserve one 's bounty - or success . So there is a `` kinder and gentler type of politician these days , Bill Clinton , affirmative action , and lots of discourse about people who `` do n't get it '' . For those of us in the winning business , this kind of talk is mildly irritating , but there is still no suggestion of losing . But what do we find now ? To put it mildy , the stereotype of our '' white male '' non-winner is Woody Hayes in the Rose Bowl , punching out photojournalists when those California fruits and nuts steal another one with a `` Hail Mary '' pass in the Fourth Quarter . ( The whole idea behind 'three yards and a cloud of dust ' is to wear your opponent down until he collapses in the final period ) But Woody just used his fists - Uzzies seem to be the weapon of choice these days . Who is D-FENS , anyway ? The answer is as plain as the horn rims on your face . The guy is MICHAEL DOUGLAS , posing as a LOSER . This is known as controversial casting . But that baggy short-sleeved white shirt sure does look natural on Mike does n't it . Gordon Gekko will never look the same . ( Though Woody always dressed that way . ) Did we really expect Gekko to take it easy and enjoy that kind of wardrobe , without putting up a fuss ? What we are starting to lose sight of is , that bashing D-FENS is the same game as bashing that poor African American slug that Clint Eastwood used to blow away all the time . As that arch-WASP ( male gender ) George C. Scott declaimed , `` Americans traditionally LOVE TO WIN . They love a winner , and will not tolerate a loser . '' And so on . The political implications are simple . If , as many socialists - and Democrats - do , you consider society a finite pie to a apportioned in some '' equitable '' way , then you have to worry about who is a winner and who is a loser to tell whose side you are on . That could be black women today , Asian homosexuals tommorrow , and yes indeed , white men some yet to be determined day when the balance of the pie has finally swung against that ( 39 % ) minority . Or you can just blow the whole thing off and say - as do most conservatives and all the libertarians - and act is if you did n't care who 's winning and who 's losing . In some cases , you might say something about make sure the game is fair ( equality of opportunity , not of condition ) . In the latter case , you might be able to identify yourself as a '' neoconservative '' or a `` neoliberal '' depending on how much you want to limit the pot . Either way you go , the way of the Winner is no longer the way to be popular - at least after you graduate from High School ( but you 'll still be popular at High School reunions ) . But it beats being a Nerd , as I would imagine Michael Douglas would now agree , and in the long run , it is the only way to go . ( Even in Hollywood , which treats Losers worse than any other place in America except for New York and Washington , D.C. - and even in Columbus , Ohio , which produced Alex Keaton , but no champion football teams in the eighties and the first quarter of the nineties ) I 'd like to see more Winners in this society , regardless of race , gender , religious preference , and sexual orientation . Maybe we should even let a few more of them be white men ! ! ( We should DEFINITELY let the Buckeyes win the Rose Bowl someday ) Bill R. -- '' The only proposals in the Senate that I `` My opinions do not represent have seen fit to mention are particularly those of my employer or praiseworthy or particularly scandalous ones . any government agency . '' It seems to me that the historian 's foremost - Bill Riggs duty is to ensure that virtue is remembered , and to deter evil words and deeds with the fear of posterity 's damnation .

I have the same problem . I have looked at Motif++ , WWL , InterViews , GINA++ , and a few variations on the above . I 've also done a cursory examination of Rogue Wave 's View.h++ . I like View.h++ 's abstractions best of all of the toolkits I mentioned , but the resulting code looks little like Motif , and I have little confidence that this software will catch on or otherwise result in significant longevity for my code . GINA++ allows you to write code which looks a great deal like Motif and also makes interesting use of inheritance , but the resulting code is almost too Motif-like , and is certainly not significantly less verbose than equivalent C code . InterViews looks promising , but I have n't found a free version with Motif support , and I'm not confident how widely InterViews with Motif support will be adopted , and what ( if any ) specific Motif support will be available over time . The other libraries produce code which is less Motif-like , but which does not make sufficient use of the features of C++ to simplify my coding task . At this point , my inclination is to write my Motif manipulation routines in C , and invoke those routines from my C++ code using simple abstractions suited to my specific task . Later , if OSF or some credible standards-setting body comes up with a C++ interface to Motif , I will change to that . It does me no goo to write in C++ if my choice of interfaces leaves me with code which leaves me tied to an abstraction which is not consistent with the industry directions . It 's better to take a standard if inferior solution for now than to go with a slgihtly superior approach which will leave me with both useless code and useless skills a few years from now . Views.h++ is the only library I 'd consider right now , but in our environment , we 'd end up spending nearly $ 5000 to use it , and I ca n't justify it when it 's likely to cause short-term productivity decreases as we learn the new abstraction , and is unlikely to be a sufficiently long-lived solution for us to reap the benefits at the high end of the J curve . - Brad -- Brad Daniels ` | `` If money ca n't buy happiness , daniels @ neosoft.com | I guess I 'll have to rent it .

Since we apparently do n't have the sensor base you folks have , they 're installing cameras at strategic points along the freeways ( initial tests are going to be in the Santa Clara area I 'm told ) , with the video being piped into a command center they 're building somewhere in the East Bay . I 'm not sure if frame grabbers or cheap labor will be used to interpret the data , but large multi-colored status displays will show the various routes using different colors to represent the various average speeds for each stretch of highway . An announcer will sit in front of the status 'wall ' , and will relay continuous verbal traffic status to those who want to receive it . They 're apparently also looking into licensing a low-AM frequency to be dedicated to providing continuous audio from this system . In the mean time , they 'll set up large incandescent display boards along the test stretch to provide commuters with data on traffic conditions up ahead . My understanding is that the system is subsidized as a pilot program , and information from it will be available free of charge . Perhaps the LA system is similarly free or provided at an obviously subsidized rate ( read '' cheap '' ) . We also have the traffic reports that are broadcast on the SAP audio channel of television channels 2 and 36 . These are verbal reports , qualified with a identification tone to tell in-vehicle receivers like the 'Auto Talk ' that the information coming next is applicable to a given area . In LA , they 're probably using some other TV channels , but the concept is the same . Try setting your stereo TV or VCR to receive the SAP audio channel , and go station jumping to find out which one is broadcasting this information . I believe this program is also subsidized , making the in-vehicle receivers cheap to purchase ( and without having to incur monthly fees to use it ) . Since the makers of these in-vehicle receivers do n't have to pay for the broadcast ( this may not be completely true ) , they likely have no investment in keeping the system up and running when the Cal Trans stuff hits the airwaves . You may have a nifty little TV audio receiver in your car , nothing more , when this happens . Perhaps a word to the wise ... ? ; ) I think we 'd all be interested in a summary post if you get more info on how the LA system is networked and paid for . Cheers , Alan < acooney @ netcom.com >

But the difinition of modify that applies to how `` well regulated '' modifies `` militia '' is : to qualify or limit the meaning of .

'' The amendment is similiar to the statement : A wet day , being annoying , the right of the people to keep and wear boots , shall not be infringed . So how does a dry day pertain the right to use boots ?

No not , unconditional , but `` shall not be infringed '' . Infringed is defined as : To break or ignore the terms of or obligations ( an oath , an agreement , law , or the like ) ; to disreguard ; violate . To go beyond the boundaries or limits ; tresspass ; encroach . This definition implies the following of some form of existing agreement . Laws and agreements are made in advance . Boundaries or limits of behavior are set by society as a whole . The word '' unconditional '' implies no agreements or all previous agreements are off , which is the opposite . The words used in the first amendment are much stronger , i.e. , '' congress shall make no law , '' are much stronger . They clearly ^^^^^^^^^^^ imply `` unconditional . '' If the writers of the amendment , wanted unconditional whay did n't they says , `` congress shall make no laws pertaining the the right of the people to keep and bear arms '' ? The second amendment implies a sort contract between the people the people and the state . The bigger part of the contract is the people have the right to overthrew the government and its laws at any time . To guarantee this right , the laws can not stopped the people from forming a `` well regutaled militia . '' The duties of a `` well regulated militia '' to the government are descussed in Federalist No . 29 .

From : maridai @ comm.mot.com ( Marida Ignacio ) Subject : Re : What WAS the immaculate conception ? Organization : trunking_fixed Lines : 111 Note : I am cross-posting ( actually , emailing ) this to bit.listserv.catholic while main posting goes to soc.religion.christian . [ Quotations omitted . This is in response to a question about the Immaculate Conception . I explained it , but left justification up to our Catholic readers . -- clh ] There is no direct reference in the Holy Scripture except for the mention of Mary 's _blessedness_/full of grace in the `` Annunciation '' by Angel Gabriel in Luke 1:26-28 And in the 6th month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee , named Nazareth . To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph , of the house of David ; and the virgin's name was Mary . And the angel came unto her and said , _ '' Hail , thou that art highly favoured , the Lord is with thee : blessed art thou among women . `` _ Now , now , hold that line of thought - `` the Lord is with Mary & blessed art thou among women '' - while you read on ... . In the book , `` First Lady of the World , A Popular History of Devotion to Mary '' by Peter Lappin : The _Immaculate Conception_ matter is really far more complicated than the _Assumption_ . This arose in 430 AD . It is quite possible that the feast of _Mary 's Conception_ under the title `` The Conception of Saint Anne '' , originally commemorated the _physical miracle_ of a woman _beyond the age_ of child bearing , conceiving a daughter , just as Elizabeth had conceived John the Baptist . A transfer in emphasis from the physical miracle wrought in Anne to the miracle of grace wrought by God in the soul of Mary was _logical_ . Mary is the incorruptible timber `` out of which was hewn the _tabernacle_ of Christ 's sinless body '' ; she is `` God 's Eden , in whom there is no tree of knowledge , and no serpent that harms . '' Her perfect beauty and spotlessness find their exemplar in Christ , her purity in that of the Father . At the time of the Council of Ephesus , she was hailed as `` innocent , without blemish , immaculate , inviolate , spotless , holy in soul and body , who was blessed as a lily from among thorns , unlearned in the evil ways of Eve '' . ... At the end of the thirteenth century , an Irish Franciscan , John Duns Scotus ( 1266-1308 ) , ... God maintained that it was a greater thing for Him to preserve His ( the Son ) mother from all sin _than to use His power to clease her from it later_ . ... Now let 's go to the discussion of baptism and original sin . From `` Pocket Catholic Cathechism '' by John A. Hardon : Baptism - Concupiscence Remains after Baptism . Concupiscence or the tendency to sin remains in the baptized but since it is left to provide trial , it has no power to injure those who do not consent and who by the grace of Christ Jesus , manfully resist ( Canon 5 ) . Original gifts of Adam and Eve before their fall : In the light of the foregoing , we see that our first parents were originally gifted three times over : -They had the natural gifts of human beings especially the power to think and to choose freely . -The had the _preternatural_ gifts of bodily immortality and of integrity , or the internal power to control desires . -They had the _supernatural_ gifts of sanctifying grace , the virtues of faith , hope , and charity and the corresponding title to enter heaven . By their disobedience , they lost the _supernatural and preternatural_ gifts entirely , and were weakened ( without losing ) their natural capacity to reason and to choose freely . Baptism restores the _supernatural_ life lost by Adam's sin . It _does not_ restore the _preternatural_ gifts but gifts as a title to a glorified restoration of our bodies on the last day ... Going back to _Immaculate Conception_ ( I am not sure if this interpretation is in any other books but it may be another contribution to the 'puzzle ' ) : Given the miracle of St. Anne bearing a child at a non-childbearing age , AND Christ was not yet born AND _there was no baptism yet_ on Mary 's birth but STILL , the Angel Gabriel 's greetings was : '' Hail Mary , full of grace , the Lord is with you . Blessed art thou amongst women '' . Even Mary was confused about this greeting . Mary could very well have possessed all of the _treefold original gifts above_ given to our first parents ( Adam and Eve before their sin ) : Hail Mary ( Example of praise given by the Angel Gabriel ) Full of grace ( natural , preternatural , supernatural ) The Lord is with you ( At those times , God would definitely want to be with those He has made _blessed_ ) Blessed art thou amongst women ( that says it all ) At the conception , God made Mary _full of grace and blessed_ as the 'tabernacle ' for the coming body of Christ and so , Immaculate Conception of Mary is true and Mary still has maintained her Immaculate Heart . -Marida ( P.S . I do hope that others will continue more light and facts on this matter . Thanks . )

According - > > to the Federalist Paper 's , a well regulated militia has a well defined - > > structure and follows nationally uniform regulations . - > - > Perhaps you should actually READ the Federalist Papers ! ! Perhaps you should , reread Federal 29 which deals exclusively with the '' well regulated malitia . '' Here is what is says about its character : To oblige the great body of the yeomanry , and of the other classes of the citizens , to be under arms for the purpose of going through military exercises and evolutions , as often as might be necessary to acquire the degree of perfection which would entitle them to the character of a well-regulated militia , It also talks about the `` well regulated militia '' having a nationally uniform in structure and disipline . I will note you did quote the end of this particular paragraph which states : Little more can reasonably be aimed at , with respect to the people at large , than to have them properly armed and equipped ; and in order to see that this be not neglected , it will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of a year . But , do you knew how much organization is required to training a large group of poeple twice a year . Just to try to get the same people every year , provide a basic training to new people so they can be integrated into the force , and find a suitable location , it requires a continually standing committee of organizers . Since a well regulate militia is nationally uniform in structure and disipline , and meet once or twice a year to train , how can you claim a `` well regulated militia '' is not well organized . But I will concide a `` well organized militia '' is not necessarily a `` well regulated militia . '' Several people have stated that the `` well organized militia '' is what is defined under 10 USC 311 , which states The militia of the United States consists of all able-bodied males at least 17 years of age and , except as provided in section 313 of title 32 , under 45 years of age who are , or who have made a declaration of intention to become , citizens of the United States and of female citizents of the United States who are commissioned officers of the National Guard . This deos define the militia , but were is the adjective `` well regulated . '' 10 USC 311 does not define a `` well regualed militia '' in any way , shape , or form . It only defines who can become part of a well regulated militia The Federalist Papers CLEARLY define the `` well regualed militia '' as a proper SUBSET of the militia . In the same paragraph quoted above , it talk above `` disciplining all the militia of the United States '' so they fit the `` character of a well-regulated militia . '' This is what the paragraph states about the associated costs : It would form an annual deduction from the productive labor of the country , to an amount which , calculating upon the present numbers of the people , would not fall far short of the whole expense of the civil establishments of all the States . To attempt a thing which would abridge the mass of labor and industry to so considerable an extent , would be unwise : and the experiment , if made , could not succeed , because it would not long be endured . Another quote provide by Charles Scripter is : James Madison , Federalist Paper 41 ( regarding the `` General Welfare '' clause ) : '' Nothing is more natural nor common than first to use a general phrase , and then to explain and qualify it by a recital of particulars . '' So the phrase `` the right of the people to keep and bear Arms , shall not be infringed '' must either qualify or explain the phrase `` a well regulated militia , being necessary to the security of a free state . '' The definition of `` explain '' as stated in `` The American Hertitage Dictionary of the Enlish Language '' The New College Edition , 1982 is : 1 ) To make plain or comprehensible ; remove obscruity from ; elucidate : `` It was the economists who undertook to explain this puzzle '' 2 ) To define ; explicate ; expound : He explained his plan . 3 ) To offer reasons for or a cause of ; an answer for ' justify : explain an error The second phrase clearly does not `` explain '' the first , therefore the second phrase must `` qualify '' the first . The definition given for `` qualify '' is : 1 ) To describe by enumerating the characteristics or qualities of ; characterize . 2 ) To make competent or suitable for office , position , or task . 3 ) To give legal power to ; make legally capable . 4 ) To modify , limit , or restrict , as giving exceptions . 5 ) To make less harsh or severe ; moderate 6 ) Grammar : To modify the meaning of ( a word or phrase ) Since `` the right of the people to keep and bear Arms , shall not be infringed '' does not describe , modify or make less harsh anything and it has nothing to do with grammar or some sort of position or task . By process of elimination it must fall into definition # 3 . And since # 3 deals with legal power , the same thing the Constitution does , it must be the correct definition in this case . Therefore , `` the right of the people to keep and bear Arms '' gives legal power to the `` well regualated militia '' and this legal power `` shall not be infringed '' . I thank you very much Mr Scripter , you have provided me with more evidence that the Second Amendment only concerns itseft with the people 's right to form well regulate militia , and says very little about the right of an untrained person to `` keep and bear '' a .50 caliber machine gun . And since I , totally untrained in the use of any firearm ( something I personly have meant to correct by going to a NRA gun safety course and joining a gun club ) , can not legally buy such a machine gun , I conclude the courts and democraticly elected congress agree with me . - > So now we know which category Mr. Rutledge is in ; He means to destroy - > our Liberties and Rights .

See the discussion of `` high-power rocketry '' in the rec.models.rockets frequently-asked-questions list . This is not hardware you can walk in off the street and buy ; you need proper certification . That can be had , mostly through Tripoli ( the high- power analog of the NAR ) , although the NAR is cautiously moving to extend the upper boundaries of what it considers proper too . You need special FAA authorization , but provided you are n't doing it under one of the LAX runway approaches or something stupid like that , it 's not especially hard to arrange . As with model rocketry , this sort of hardware is reasonably safe if handled properly . Proper handling takes more care , and you need a lot more empty air to fly in , but it 's basically just model rocketry scaled up . As with model rocketry , the high-power people use factory-built engines , which eliminates the major safety hazard of do-it-yourself rocketry . -- All work is one man 's work . | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology - Kipling | henry @ zoo.toronto.edu utzoo ! henry

From : db7n+ @ andrew.cmu.edu ( D. Andrew Byler ) Subject : Re : Sabbath Admissions 5of5 Organization : Freshman , Civil Engineering , Carnegie Mellon , Pittsburgh , PA Lines : 34 All of the arguments concerning the Sabbath ought to make the point pretty clear - anyone outside of the Catholic or Orthodox orAnglican or Monophysite churches ourght to worship on Saturday if they are really sola scriptura . Otherwise , they are following a law put into effect by the Church , and only the above Chruches really recognize any power of the Chruch to do so . Andy Byler [ You will note that nothing in the FAQ said anything about the Church establishing or changing a law . The argument against the Sabbath is that it is part of the ceremonial law , and like the rest of the ceremonial law is not binding on Christians . This argument is based on Paul 's letters , Acts , and in a more general sense , Jesus' teachings . Further , most people argue that Scripture shows worship occuring on Sunday , and Paul endorsing it . I understand that these points are disputed , and do not want to go around the dispute one more time . The point I 'm making here is not that these arguments are right , but that the backing they claim is Scripture . Accepting the principle of `` sola scriptura '' does not commit us to obeying the entire Jewish Law . Acts 15 and Paul 's letters are quite clear on that . I think even the SDA 's accept it . The disagreement is on where the Bible would have us place the line . By the way , Protestants do give authority to the church , in matters that are not dictated by God . That 's why churches are free to determine their own liturgies , church polity , etc . If you accept that the Sabbath is not binding on Christians , then the day of worship falls into the category of items on which individual Christians or ( since worship is by its nature a group activity ) churches are free to decide . -- clh ]

I think its an attempt to show lives_saved v lives_lost ; all other gun related crimes do n't result in lives_lost . On the other hand , its impossible to know how many of the successful self defenses prevented lives from being lost . In other words , the lives_lost is pretty clear [ its the homicide and non negligent manslaughter number ] , while the lives saved is some percentage of the successful self defenses . Clearly that percentage does n't have to be real high to show that lives_saved > lives_lost . As a semi-related point , check out Kleck 's `` Point Blank '' .

Anyone seen this before ? What is happening is this : 1 ) You turn the TV on . 2 ) The horizontal output begins normal operation . This powers up the high voltage and most of the rest of the circuitry . 3 ) A problem is sensed and the horizontal oscillator shuts down . 4 ) After it powers down the cycle repeats . Things to check : First check for a shorted high power component . Your best bet is the vertical output transistor ( s ) or , if there is one , the voltage regulator . The most common cause of this type of failure is too much current being drawn somewhere . Also look for shutdown circuits ( which your TV may or may not have ) , if you can find one that is shutting down the horizontal oscillator then it should n't be too hard to find the problem from there .

I wo n't start panicking until/unless DES or RSA or stuff like that is prohibited , but I 'm a little anxious . ( No doubt it wo n't be long before someone posts explaining how this just a small part of some far-ranging and long-lived NSA-PKP-IRS-FBI-CIA-HandgunControlInc-Clinton conspiracy to subvert freedom , democracy , and mathematics . ) My feeling is that the administration probably is n't that worried about things like DES and RSA and PGP and RIPEM , since they 'll never be used by a group much wider than us computer geeks . The fact that this just came out now suggests one of two things : 1 . The NSA has been working on this for a long time , and it only just now happened to be `` ready '' to release to the world at this time . 2 . The NSA has been working on this for a long time , but was n't able to get the Bush administration to go along with this plan . ( I find it unlikely that this would have been because of a sympathy for the unescrowed use of cryptography ; more likely the administration felt that even escrowed , secret-algorithm and , for all we know , trivially breakable cryptography should not be made widely available . ) Thus said clipper @ csrc.ncsl.nist.gov ( Clipper Chip Announcement ) : > This new technology will help companies protect proprietary > information , protect the privacy of personal phone conversations > and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted > electronically . At the same time this technology preserves the > ability of federal , state and local law enforcement agencies to > intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals . The majority of the discussion involving this `` Clipper Chip '' seems to pertain to the encryption of telephone conversations . Does anyone know if that means this chip is designed to work primarily with analog signals ? The language sort of suggests this , but it 's hard to say . The main thing I just do n't get is whether this chip implements symmetric or asymmetric cryptographic techniques . Anybody know ? I 'm guessing symmetric , but they do n't get very clear about it . If it is symmetric , how is it useful for anything other than link-level encryption with an identical chip at each end ? How can you negotiate a per-session key using symmetric cryptography without using a trusted third party who knows your key ? ( Or does it even use a per-session key ? ) If it 's asymmetric , what about PKP 's patents , which they claim cover all methods of doing asymmetric cryptography ? Are they getting royalties , or is hiding infringement the real reason for keeping the algorithm secret ? : - ) -- Marc VanHeyningen mvanheyn @ cs.indiana.edu MIME & RIPEM accepted Kirk : I wo n't hurt you .

Your fascist government got away with the genocide of 2.5 million Turkish men , women and children and is enjoying the fruits of that genocide . And your criminal organization will not get away with the genocide 's cover-up . In June 1915 , a major uprising took place in Sebinkarahisar under the leadership of the famous Nazi Boyadjian . The Moslem districts were burnt down . Hundreds of soldiers and gendarmerie were killed and hundreds of civilians also perished . Armenians first of all occupied the Talori region , which included the villages of Siner , Simai , Gulli-Guzat , Ahi , Hedenk , Sinank , Ekind , Effard , Musson , Etek , Akcesser . Leaving their wives , children and property in these inaccessible spots , the Armenians joined forces with other armed bands coming from the Silvan districts in the plain of Mus , after which the whole body of 3000 men gathered in the Andok Mt . Five or six hundred wished to surround Mus , and started off by attacking the Delican tribe to the south of the city . They slaughtered a number of the tribe and seized their goods . The religious beliefs of the Muslims who fell into their hands were derided and disparaged , and the Muslims themselves murdered in the most frightful manner . The rebels also attacked the regular troops in the vicinity of Mus , but the large numbers of the regular forces prevented them from occupying the city . The rebels joined the bandits in the Andok Mts. , carrying out the most frightful massacres and looting among the tribes of the neighbourhood . They burned Omer Agha 's nephew alive . They raped a number of Turkish women at a spot three or four hours' distance from Gulli-Guzat and then strangled them . At the beginning of August the rebels attacked the Faninar , Bekiran and Badikan tribes , perpetrating equally horrible atrocities . The rebels in the villages of Yermut and Ealigernuk in the nahiye of Cinan in the kaza of Cal attacked the Kurds in the neighbourhood , as well as the villages of Kaisser and Catcat . Towards the end of August , the Armenians attacked the Kurds in the vicinity of Mus and burned down three or four villages , including Gulli-Guzat . As for the 3000 rebels in Talori , they continued to spread death and destruction among the Muslims and other Christian communities , refusing to lay down their arms .

I think that HCI people honestly believe that passing more gun control laws will be in the best interests of public safety . Why do I think this ? Because I used to buy the HCI line . During my freshman year ( 1987 ) , their line made so much sense -- only people who `` need '' guns should be able to get them , and the people who `` need '' them are the police and other elites . Unfortunately for us , this position is highly emotional and not well thought-out . They never stop to think that HCI 's position basically says that the non-elite are incompetents ( that 's you and me , folks ! ) and that the Second Amendment has absolutely nothing to do with hunting or other `` legitimate '' uses ( which excludes overthrowing tyrannical governments and defending yourself when the police have proven they ca n't protect you ) . > We all know that the end result , regardless of the intention , > will be to have a MUCH easier to subdue population for the UN/NWO . > This is definitely a motivation of many in power , but I wonder to > what degree this is planned vs just duped . Every pro-control person I 've talked to is always left stumped when I simply argue the facts of gun control ( that it has yet to be proven to lower crime rates ) and weapons terminology ( and I 'm no expert -- but explaining exactly how an `` evil '' semiautomatic weapon really works does wonders ) . I hvae personally found well-reasoned arguments to be most effective against the emotional pro-control people .

I have listened to several of the men involved in this study , and even they claim that the men involved will not 'tell the whole truth ' . I put little value in extrapolating from these types of 'studies ' or 'surveys ' , they have limited subsets of individuals , and there is alot of skewing due to improper selection methods , and the bias of the people involved in the studies on both sides- subject and researcher . Would you admit to be part of a group that was not very well liked ? Would you admit to having had sex with other people at some considered abnormal rate ( this applies to heterosexual men ) . In fact , as one gay man and one straight man put it , `` men lie about the number of partners , because that's the thing to do '' - our culture for the male almost requires this type of response . It may seem harmless and silly , but carries a large emotional and mental price tag . I hear college male students everyday talking about their 'supposed ' conquest . They just have to look good to one another , at least in their eyes . But also know that alot of this does go on , there are many college males ( hetero ) having a lot of sex with different partners .

I agree completely , but there was only a refund for people who bought the GC with a Quadra . I have seen an alpha version of an extension from Apple called 8.24 GC QuickTime Video which offloads QuickTime compression/decompression from the cpu to the AM29000 on the card .

First and foremost , I want to mention some common sense . If it 's a choice between injuring/killing a dog or getting yourself injured/killed , there is only one rational decision . Only the most insane animal rights kook would put the dog first . Second , it 's useful to learn how to read a dog 's body language . How you react to a dog who is chasing you because he thinks it 's a game ( and that you're playing with him ) is completely different from how you react to a dog which has hostile intent . Third , it 's useful to learn how to present yourself to a dog . Dogs are social beasts , and recognize a domination/submission hierarchy . To a dog , there are two types of fellow-creatures ; that which he dominates , and that which dominate him . You need to unambiguously represent yourself as being of the latter class . You are God : you are easily angered and your anger is terrible . But God is also amused by one who properly submits to His dominance , and may even on rare occasions dispense a kind word , a kind word , or even ( oh joy oh rapture unforeseen ) A Dog Bisquit ! Now , how does that all relate to biking ? Well , first , it 's a good idea to assume that most dogs who chase motorcycles do so because they think it 's a game , and not out of overt hostility . The MSF suggestion is a very good one ; when you see the dog coming , slow down so he determines a particular place of interception . Just before you ( and he ) reach that spot , punch the throttle so that when he reaches it you 're already long gone . Dogs take a few seconds to react to new input , and definitely can not comprehend the acceleration that a motorcycle is capable of . With a hostile dog , or one which you repeatedly encounter , stronger measures may be necessary . This is the face off . First -- and there is very important -- make sure you NEVER face off a dog on his territory . Face him off on the road , not on his driveway . If necessary , have a large stick , rolled up newspaper , etc . ( something the beast will understand is something that will hurt him ) . Stand your ground , then slowly advance . Your mental attitude is that you are VERY ANGRY and are going to dispense TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT . The larger the dog , the greater your anger . Dogs will pick up anger , just as they can pick up fear . And , since you and he are not on his home territory , it may suddenly dawn on the dog that perhaps he is on your territory , and that you are prepared to fight to the death . Most dogs will decide that it is a good idea to retreat to their own territory where there is at least a home advantage . They 'll also observe that you are satisfied by that retreat ( gesture of submission ) and thus they have escaped punishment . The interesting thing about dogs is that body language communicates a great deal to them . The more effective you are at communicating body language , the less you actually have to do . After 7 years with my 93 pound beast , I've learned a few tricks I think ...

The first period started with a give away from a Canadian defenseman and Rundqvist came in alone on Ranford but could n't put the puck over a sliding Ranford . Later on , Kevin Dineen had a great opportunity but Soderstrom played very well too . Stefan Nilsson had a couple of great dekes and set up Jan Larsson but again Ranford came up big . Period ended scoreless but the edge to Sweden in creating more opportunities . Second period action saw Tommy Soderstrom making a GREAT save . Mark Recchi made a backhanded cross ice pass to Lindros , Eric one timed the puck but Soderstrom was there to make a glove hand save . At the 7-minute mark , Canada started applying pressure on the Swedes . Sanderson-Dineen-Brind'Amour worked hard and kept the puck in the Swedes ' zone . Dineen gave the puck to Sanderson who skated around a screened Swedish defenseman , came in on Soderstrom and made a wrist shot that went it by Soderstrom 's far post , 1-0 Canada . The Swedes picked up their game after that , and Peter Forsberg had a shot that hit Ranford 's post ( the inside ) , went parallel to the goal line and out . Then Gartner got a penalty and the Swedes a power play . Jan Larsson took a shot from the slot , Ranford gave a rebound to Larsson who saw Juhlin by the far post , passed the puck and Ranford was beat , 1-1 . Third period started as the other periods , Swedes having most of the pressure but the Canadians always dangerous once they were close to the Swede goal . At 5:54 , Canada created some great chances and Arto Blomsten was forced to cover the puck in the Swede goal crease since Soderstrom lost sight of it . That resulted in a penalty shot , since a defenseman ca n't cover the puck in the goal crease . Geoff Sanderson took the penalty shot ( his first ever , he explained afterwards ) , and he put it low on Soderstrom 's stick side , close to the post . Excellent penalty shot to give Canada a go ahead goal . Canada increased the lead on a very suspect offside , Gartner volleyed a bouncing puck past Soderstrom to make it 3-1 . The Swedes ran out of gas then and could n't produce as good scoring chances as they had for 2,5 periods . The 4-1 goal came with only 1 second left , Rod Brind'Amour scoring on a rebound from Soderstrom , where the Swedish defense already had their minds in the dressing room . A very good game ( the best in the WC so far ? ) , with both goalies playing great . Soderstrom best player in Sweden , but Ranford even played better than Soderstrom , that tells you something about Ranford . Probably the best goalie in the world , were some comments after the game . Canada played a very disciplined defense , Ranford pointed out that it is easy to play well with a good defense . Lindros played A LOT and played well , Sanderson naturally game hero with two goals . The Forsberg-Naslund-Bergqvist line Sweden 's best along with Larsson-Juhlin- Nilsson . Swedish defense played well , 197 cm 104 kg Peter Popovic had the task of neutralizing 192 cm 107 kg Eric Lindros , and managed this very well . Ranger defenseman Peter Andersson finally got to go to the WC , and considering that he landed in Germany just a few hours before the game , he played very well . Swedish coach Curt Lundmark was irritated after the game , partly because of the Swedes inability to score , and partly because of the linesman 's mistake on the 1-3 goal .

Consider deleting these edges . 1 ) Now , there are two goals : a ) move the DistortedData ( x , y ) to the Reference ( x , y ) b ) keep the Length ( e ) ( as measured from the current ( x , y ) 's ) as close as possible to the DigitizedLength ( e ) ( as measured using the digitized ( x , y ) 's ) . 2 ) For every point , compute a displacement based on a ) and b ) . For example : a ) For ( x , y ) points for which you know the Reference ( x , y ) , you can move alpha0* ( Reference ( x , y ) - Current ( x , y ) ) . This will slowly move the DistortedReference ( x , y ) towards the Reference ( x , y ) . b ) For all other points , examine the current length of each edge . For each edge , compute a displacement which would make that edge the correct length ( where `` correct '' is the DigitizedLength ) . Take the vector sum of these edge displacements , and move the point alpha1*SumOfEdgeDisplacements . This will keep the triangulated mesh consistent with your Digitized mesh . 3 ) Iterate 2 ) until you are happy ( for example , no point moves very much ) . alpha0 and alpha1 need to be determined by experimentation . Consider how much you believe the Reference ( x , y ) - i.e. , do you absolutely insist on the final points exactly matching the References , or do you want to balance some error in matching the Reference against changes in length of the edges . WARNING : there are a couple of geometric invariants which must be observed ( essentially , you ca n't allow the convex hull to change , and you ca n't allow triangles to `` fold over '' neighboring triangles . Both of these can be handled either by special case checks on the motion of individual points , or by periodically re-triangulating the points ( using the current positions - but still calculating DigitizedLength from the original positions . When we first did this , the triangulation time was prohibitive , so we only did it once . If I were motivated to try and change code that has been working in production mode for 5 years , I *might* go back and re-triangulate on every iteration . If you have more compute power than you know what to do with , you might consider having every point interact with every other point ... .but first read up on linear solutions to the n-body problem . There are lots of papers in the last 10 years of SIGGRAPH proceedings on springs , constraints , and energy calculations which are relevant .

Though I ca n't imagine WANTING to have intercourse during a full-blown yeast infection : - ) chances of it being transmitted to the male are quite low , especially if he 's circumcised . But it can happen . At one point I was getting recurrent yeast infections and the Dr suspected my boyfriend might have gotten it from me and be reinfecting me . The prescription was interesting . For each day of the medication ( a week ) I was to insert the medication , then to have intercourse . The resulting action would help the medicine be spread around in me better , and would simultaneously treat him .

Beginning with U.N. Security Council Resolution 713 of September 25 , 1991 , the United Nations has been actively addressing the crisis in the former Yugoslavia . The Security Council acted in Resolution 781 to establish a ban on all unauthorized military flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina . There have , however , been blatant violations of the ban , and villages in Bosnia have been bombed . In response to these violations , the Security Council decided , in Resolution 816 of March 31 , 1993 , to extend the ban to all unauthorized flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina and to authorize Member States , acting nationally or through regional organi- zations , to take all necessary measures to ensure compliance . NATO 's North Atlantic Council ( NAC ) agreed to provide NATO air enforcement for the no-fly zone . The U.N. Secretary General was notified of NATO 's decision to proceed with Operation DENY FLIGHT , and an activation order was delivered to participating allies . The United States actively supported these decisions . At my direction , the Joint Chiefs of Staff sent an execute order to all U.S. forces participating in the NATO force , for the conduct of phased air operations to prevent flights not authorized by the United Nations over Bosnia-Herzegovina . The U.S. forces initially assigned to this operation consist of 13 F-15 and 12 F-18A fighter aircraft and supporting tanker aircraft . These aircraft commenced enforcement operations at 8:00 a.m. e.d.t . on April 12 , 1993 . The fighter aircraft are equipped for combat to accomplish their mission and for self-defense . NATO has positioned forces and has established combat air patrol ( CAP ) stations within the control of Airborne Early Warning ( AEW ) aircraft . The U.S. CAP aircraft will normally operate from bases in Italy and from an aircraft carrier in the Adriatic Sea . Unauthorized aircraft entering or approaching the no-fly zone will be identified , interrogated , intercepted , escorted/monitored , and turned away ( in that order ) . If these steps do not result in compliance with the no-fly zone , such aircraft may be engaged on the basis of proper authorization by NATO military authorities and in accordance with the approved more ( OVER ) 2 rules of engagement , although we do not expect such action will be necessary . The Commander of UNPROFOR ( the United Nations Protection Force currently operating in Bosnia-Herzegovina ) was consulted to ensure that his concerns for his force were fully considered before the rules of engagement were approved . It is not possible to predict at this time how long such operations will be necessary . I have directed U.S. armed forces to participate in these operations pursuant to my constitutional authority as Commander in Chief . I am grateful for the con- tinuing support that the Congress has given to this effort , and I look forward to continued cooperation as we move forward toward attainment of our goals in this region .

It remanded the case back to the trial court because the miller court didn't know if the weapon in question was a militia weapon . ( Does n't it bother anyone that a major constitutional issue was taken up in a case where there was no defense ?

From : qtm2w @ virginia.edu ( Quinn T. McCord ) Subject : Questions from a newbie Organization : University of Virginia Lines : 56 Is life a pass/fail course , and does God grade on a curve ? I 'm new here , and only vaguely religious , but I want to know what some of you people think . Specifically , are there an infinite number of Heavens , and a person goes to the one that he/she deserves ? Or is it simply Heaven or nothing ( Hell ? ) Also , are we `` graded '' by those around us , or has there always been some unchanging method ? Is the person 's childhood taken into account ? I 'm sure these must sound like over-simplifications to most of you , but I figure that you 're the experts . -Quinn [ Eschatology is an area on which Christians do not agree . I suspect that 's because our primary source of information is prophets and visionaries , and their writings tend to be highly symbolic . However both Jesus ' teachings in the Gospels and books such as the Revelation to John talk primarily about the difference between eternal life and eternal death . On a number of occasions Jesus does say things that imply some sort of differentiation , e.g . Lk 10:14 and a number of similar passages where Jesus says things like `` even XXX will be better off than you in the judgement . '' Also , I Cor 3 talks about someone who gets into heaven , but by the skin of his teeth , as it were . But these passages are not normally interpreted as suggesting separate heavens , so much as differing levels of prestige or punishment in heaven or hell ( and not all Christians would even go as far as that ) . The only Christian group I know of that believes in multiple heavens is the Mormons , and they are very far from mainstream Christianity ( far enough that many of our readers would not call them Christian ) . Their ideas in this area involve specific Mormon revelations , in addition to the Bible and `` Holy Tradition '' of a more generic Christian sort . Note that many Christians will cringe at the very thought of associating grading with God . The whole point of Christ was to free us from the results of a test that we could n't possibly pass . If you like test analogies , God grades on a very strict and unbending scale , but he also cheats -- he replaces our test papers with an exam that was prepared by the teacher , before actually doing the grading . Because some people end up in heaven and others in hell , it 's easy to see why you 'd be inclined to think of it as grading . While there are differences among branches of Christianity on details , I think we all agree that in one way or another , God cheats . I am personally very sceptical about anyone who claims to know exactly how far God 's cheating extends . Will he accept people who don't explicitly acknowledge Christ , but somehow still follow him in their hearts ? Many Christians believe that this is possible , at least in principle , but certainly not all do . Jesus provided us with a clear description of how to be saved , but it 's not clear to me that he provided an exact description of how he 's going to place the dividing line . Certainly he made it clear that we ca n't expect to know whether other individuals are saved or not . -- clh ]

Blacks have the same ( +- 2 % ) crime report rate , arrest rate , and incarceration rate for violent crimes . So I doubt that for violent crimes , that there is any inherent bias mechanism present . There is a wider discrepancy for all crimes for blacks wrt to 3 categories . Interestingly enough , the discrepancy is the largest in the Southern United States -- where blacks are incarcerated well BELOW the average in the rest of the United States ! Which points to an anti-bias-against wrt blacks . In any case , for violent crimes and burglary and drug selling , blacks are reported 53 % , arrested 44 % , and are present in jails/prisons 47 % ( 1988 ) . Considering that 12 % of the population is black , 6 % are black males , and some percentage of that is out of the high/low age groups , we do have a situation where ( if I remember my old calculations right ) 4 % of the population commits almost half of the really nasty crimes . Blacks with similar histories ( crime ) to whites get the same sentences , except in the South , where they receive around 20 % less on paper ! ! -- There are actually people that STILL believe Love Canal was some kind of environmental disaster .

Burzynski says that his work has met with hostility in the United States , despite the favorable responses of his subjects during clinical trials . What is the generally accepted opinion of Dr. Burzynski 's research ? He paints himself as a lone researcher with a new breakthrough battling an intolerant medical establishment , but I have no basis from which to judge his claims . Two weeks ago , however , I read that the NIH 's Department of Alternative Medicine has decided to focus their attention on Burzynski 's work .

My ' k ' key works overtime as it is just to Then what seems to be the problem ? Did you ever read newspaper at all ? `` PAINFUL SEARCH .. '' THE GRUESOME extent of February 's killings of Azeris by Armenians in the town of Hojali is at last emerging in Azerbaijan - about 600 men , women and children dead in the worst outrage of the four-year war over Nagorny Karabakh . The figure is drawn from Azeri investigators , Hojali officials and casualty lists published in the Baku press . Diplomats and aid workers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates . The 25 February attack on Hojali by Armenian forces was one of the last moves in their four-year campaign to take full control of Nagorny Karabakh , the subject of a new round of negotiations in Rome on Monday . The bloodshed was something between a fighting retreat and a massacre , but investigators say that most of the dead were civilians . The awful number of people killed was first suppressed by the fearful former Communist government in Baku . Later it was blurred by Armenian denials and grief-stricken Azerbaijan 's wild and contradictory allegations of up to 2,000 dead . The State Prosecuter , Aydin Rasulov , the cheif investigator of a 15-man team looking into what Azerbaijan calls the `` Hojali Disaster '' , said his figure of 600 people dead was a minimum on preliminary findings . A similar estimate was given by Elman Memmedov , the mayor of Hojali . An even higher one was printed in the Baku newspaper Ordu in May - 479 dead people named and more than 200 bodies reported unidentified . This figure of nearly 700 dead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova , the new spokeswoman of the Azeri Ministry of Defence . FranCois Zen Ruffinen , head of delegation of the International Red Cross in Baku , said the Muslim imam of the nearby city of Agdam had reported a figure of 580 bodies received at his mosque from Hojali , most of them civilians . `` We did not count the bodies . But the figure seems reasonable . It is no fantasy , '' Mr Zen Ruffinen said . `` We have some idea since we gave the body bags and products to wash the dead . '' Mr Rasulov endeavours to give an unemotional estimate of the number of dead in the massacre . `` Do n't get worked up . It will take several months to get a final figure , '' the 43-year-old lawyer said at his small office . Mr Rasulov knows about these things . It took him two years to reach a firm conclusion that 131 people were killed and 714 wounded when Soviet troops and tanks crushed a nationalist uprising in Baku in January 1990 . Those nationalists , the Popular Front , finally came to power three weeks ago and are applying pressure to find out exactly what happened when Hojali , an Azeri town which lies about 70 miles from the border with Armenia , fell to the Armenians . Officially , 184 people have so far been certified as dead , being the number of people that could be medically examined by the republic 's forensic department . `` This is just a small percentage of the dead , '' said Rafiq Youssifov , the republic 's chief forensic scientist . `` They were the only bodies brought to us . Remember the chaos and the fact that we are Muslims and have to wash and bury our dead within 24 hours . '' Of these 184 people , 51 were women , and 13 were children under 14 years old . Gunshots killed 151 people , shrapnel killed 20 and axes or blunt instruments killed 10 . Exposure in the highland snows killed the last three . Thirty-three people showed signs of deliberate mutilation , including ears , noses , breasts or penises cut off and eyes gouged out , according to Professor Youssifov's report . Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those believed to have been killed , Mr Rasulov said . Files from Mr Rasulov 's investigative commission are still disorganised - lists of 44 Azeri militiamen are dead here , six policemen there , and in handwriting of a mosque attendant , the names of 111 corpses brought to be washed in just one day . The most heartbreaking account from 850 witnesses interviewed so far comes from Towfiq Manafov , an Azeri investigator who took a helicopter flight over the escape route from Hojali on 27 February . `` There were too many bodies of dead and wounded on the ground to count properly : 470-500 in Hojali , 650-700 people by the stream and the road and 85-100 visible around Nakhchivanik village , '' Mr Manafov wrote in a statement countersigned by the helicopter pilot . `` People waved up to us for help . We saw three dead children and one two-year-old alive by one dead woman . The live one was pulling at her arm for the mother to get up . We tried to land but Armenians started a barrage against our helicopter and we had to return . '' There has been no consolidation of the lists and figures in circulation because of the political upheavals of the last few months and the fact that nobody knows exactly who was in Hojali at the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villages taken over by Armenian forces . THE INDEPENDENT , London , 12/6/'92 HEROES WHO FOUGHT ON AMID THE BODIES AREF SADIKOV sat quietly in the shade of a cafe-bar on the Caspian Sea esplanade of Baku and showed a line of stitches in his trousers , torn by an Armenian bullet as he fled the town of Hojali just over three months ago , writes Hugh Pope . `` I 'm still wearing the same clothes , I do n't have any others , '' the 51-year-old carpenter said , beginning his account of the Hojali disaster . `` I was wounded in five places , but I am lucky to be alive . '' Mr Sadikov and his wife were short of food , without electricity for more than a month , and cut off from helicopter flights for 12 days . They sensed the Armenian noose was tightening around the 2,000 to 3,000 people left in the straggling Azeri town on the edge of Karabakh . `` At about 11pm a bombardment started such as we had never heard before , eight or nine kinds of weapons , artillery , heavy machine-guns , the lot , '' Mr Sadikov said . Soon neighbours were pouring down the street from the direction of the attack . Some huddled in shelters but others started fleeing the town , down a hill , through a stream and through the snow into a forest on the other side . To escape , the townspeople had to reach the Azeri town of Agdam about 15 miles away . They thought they were going to make it , until at about dawn they reached a bottleneck between the two Armenian villages of Nakhchivanik and Saderak . `` None of my group was hurt up to then ... Then we were spotted by a car on the road , and the Armenian outposts started opening fire , '' Mr Sadikov said . Azeri militiamen fighting their way out of Hojali rushed forward to force open a corridor for the civilians , but their efforts were mostly in vain . Mr Sadikov said only 10 people from his group of 80 made it through , including his wife and militiaman son . Seven of his immediate relations died , including his 67-year-old elder brother . `` I only had time to reach down and cover his face with his hat , '' he said , pulling his own big flat Turkish cap over his eyes . `` We have never got any of the bodies back . '' The first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire . One hero of the evacuation , Alif Hajief , was shot dead as he struggled to change a magazine while covering the third group's crossing , Mr Sadikov said . Another hero , Elman Memmedov , the mayor of Hojali , said he and several others spent the whole day of 26 February in the bushy hillside , surrounded by dead bodies as they tried to keep three Armenian armoured personnel carriers at bay . As the survivors staggered the last mile into Agdam , there was little comfort in a town from which most of the population was soon to flee . `` The night after we reached the town there was a big Armenian rocket attack . Some people just kept going , '' Mr Sadikov said . `` I had to get to the hospital for treatment . I was in a bad way . They even found a bullet in my sock .

I can only assume the models Aero Design uses to design its suits are in some way different from us real folks . Also , even though it 's related to convienience , you look pretty damn wierd walking around with the tops and bottoms while running errands . I 've gotten some really suspicious looks , and sweated a lot while in a store wearing the whole suit , since you ca n't fit the top and bottom in any motorcycle storage device yet devised ( except the trunk in my sidecar rig : - ) . With the two piece , I unzip the pants ( I generally leave the two pieces zipped together , primarily because the pants fall down unless I pull the cheesy elastic belt-type band real tight ) , stuff them in one of my spacious BMW saddlebags ( the pants just fit ) , and run errands just wearing the jacket . Actually , if I know I 'll be running errands , I just wear my V-Pilot jacket , but that 's just me ... As far as crash protection , I 'd say that both suits are probably equal . It seems that for weather protection , if anything the 2 piece provides a little more because of the jacket overlapping the pants by 3 inches . The 2 piece is probably a little less comfortable around the waist , just because of the extra layer of stuff , but maybe not . So I 'd have to vote for the two piece . Despite the slightly odd fit , I still find the suit the most versatile piece of riding clothing I own . Would n't go long distance without it .

No one else seems to know , so I 'll post this . This topic came up on sci.physics.fusion shortly after the cold-fusion flap started . As I recall , its been done to some experimental mice . They showed various ill effects and eventually died . The reason is that deuterium does not have exactly the same reaction rates as hydrogen due to its extra mass ( which causes lower velocity , Boltzman constant , mumble ) . This throws various bits of body biochemistry out of kilter , and you get sick and die . I 've never heard of anyone being poisened this way , in or out of real life . The process takes quite a while . If anyone wants to write this book , I would imagine you would have to : 1 : Replace a significant fraction of the water in the body with heavy water . 2 : Wait while normal breakdown and repair processes cause other molecules in the body to be synthesised using the deuterium . During this process the victim would gradually deteriorate and eventually die , but I imagine it would take weeks during which the poisoner would have to ensure that a significant proportion of the water the victim ingested was heavy . You would get such a mess of symptoms that the doctors would be both alarmed and confused . Why should every organ in the body suddenly begin to deteriorate ? If you can figure out how the poisoner gets the heavy water into the victim in a hospital then you could have a real story here . Come to think of it , < 2 > would continue even after the heavy water was no longer being ingested , so hospitalisation might be too late . The most detectable effect would be that the victim 's body fluids would literally be `` heavy '' . Water has a molecular weight of 18 and heavy water has a MW of 20 . Thus the victim 's weight will increase by about 1 % for every 10 % of body water replaced by heavy water . Maybe the detection occurs because some pathologist in the lab notices that the victim 's urine is strangely dense . Is there any medical test involving the specific gravity of a body fluid ?

From : inoue @ crd.yokogawa.co.jp ( Inoue Takeshi ) Subject : How to see characterset from wchar_t Nntp-Posting-Host : emu Distribution : comp Organization : Yokogawa Electric Corporation , Tokyo , Japan Lines : 137 We developed a toolkit running on the X Window System . The toolkit copes with any languages based on X11R5 's i18n facility . As you know , there are 2 kinds of i18n implementation from MIT 's X11R5 release -- Xsi and Ximp . Our original implementation of the toolkit uses Xsi . Our toolkit manages each character 's size based on our own font management system . In order to do that , the 'wchar_t ' typed character strings must be decomposed to character sets . This means that if one wchar_t type compound string with ASCII and Kanji mixed , for example , is given , each element of the wchar_t array must be checked its corresponding character set based on a bit layout and application environment 's locale . In this case if the locale is 'japanese ' , each wchar_t character will be classified either to iso8859-1 , jisx0208 or so . We need a function to do this . The function must check how many characters from the top are the same character set and what the character set is . We could not find any public X11R5 function to do that and inevitably , used Xsi 's internal functions to construct that function . The following is the source code of that function 'decomposeCharacterSet ( ) ' . //I18N.h // This may look like C code , but it is really -*- C++ -*- // $ Id : I18N.h , v 1.1 1992/01/21 12:05:24 iima Exp iima $ # ifndef _I18N_H # define _I18N_H # include < X11/Xlib.h > extern int decomposeCharacterSet ( const wchar_t *wc_str , /* IN */ int wc_len , /* IN */ char *buf , /* OUT */ int *buflen , /* IN/OUT */ int *scanned_len , /* OUT */ char **charset ) ; /* OUT */ extern XmString wcharToXmString ( const wchar_t *wc_str ) ; extern XmStringCharSet charsetOfWchar ( const wchar_t wc ) ; # endif /* _I18N_H */ //I18N.cc /* $ Id : I18N.cc , v 1.1 1992/01/21 12:05:05 iima Exp $ */ # include < stdlib.h > # include < X11/Xlibint.h > # include < Xm/Xm.h > # include `` I18N.h '' extern `` C '' { # include < X11/wchar.h > # define _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset XXX_XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset # define _Xmbfscs XXX_Xmbfscs # define _Xmbctidtocsid XXX_Xmbctidtocsid # include `` Xlocaleint.h '' # undef _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset # undef _Xmbfscs # undef _Xmbctidtocsid extern int _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset ( XLocale , const wchar_t* , int , char* , int* , int* , int* ) ; extern Charset *_Xmbfscs ( XLocale , _CSID ) ; extern _CSID _Xmbctidtocsid ( XLocale , _CSID ) ; } ; int decomposeCharacterSet ( const wchar_t *wc_str , /* IN */ int wc_len , /* IN */ char *buf , /* OUT */ int *buf_len , /* IN/OUT */ int *scanned_len , /* OUT */ char **charset ) /* OUT */ { XLocale xlocale = _XFallBackConvert ( ) ; int ctid ; int status ; Charset *xcharset ; status = _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset ( xlocale , wc_str , wc_len , buf , buf_len , scanned_len , & ctid ) ; if ( status == Success ) { xcharset = _Xmbfscs ( xlocale , _Xmbctidtocsid ( xlocale , ctid ) ) ; *charset = ( xcharset ) ? xcharset- > cs_name : NULL ; } else *charset = NULL ; return status ; } -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- An included file above , `` Xlocaleint.h '' , is also Xsi internal and we copied the file to the toolkit directory and compiled . A serious issue occured when we tried to compile a toolkit application on our HP machine with its OS version of HP-UX9.01 . When we tried to link an application based on our toolkit , link errors occured saying that the following functions are missing : _Xmbctidtocsid ( code ) _Xmbfscs ( code ) _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset ( code ) _XFallBackConvert ( code ) We had used MIT release version of X11R5 and its Xsi implementation until HP-UP9.0 and ran applications successfully . One of the reasons to use Xsi was that because HP did not release HP 's X11R5 until the OS 9.0 and we had no way to know how HP 's R5 would be implemented . We had hoped Xsi 's popularity and used its internal functions . The HP 's linker complains that there are no Xsi internal functions implemented . We observe from HP 's libX11.a , they used some Ximp implementation but we are not sure if they used MIT 's vanilla Ximp version or their own version of Ximp and therefore , finding just counter part functions in MIT 's Ximp for Xsi does not seem to lead us a solution . My question and goal is to know how we can construct a function like 'decomposeCharacterset ( ) ' listed above . Is there any function to check character set of each element of wchar_t type strings depending on locales ? If it is a public function , that is perfect but even if it is not , we want to use any internal functions in HP 's X11R5 as we did for MIT 's R5 . In order to render a 'wchar_t ' type string , there must be some machinery to judge character sets and that is how the proper fonts are selected for the string . We have no way to find out that without any HP 's X11R5 source files . We want to know how we can use that for our goal . Any help or comments would be highly appreciated . I also appreciate if anyone tell me about Ximp treating around this area even if it is not HP 's implementation .

There has never been any evidence that there were any regular or irregular Arab forces in the village apart from the villagers defending themselves . According to the Haganah observer Pa'il , the Irgun/Lehi forces suffered a lot of casualties because they were incompetent soldiers . When they ran into trouble securing the central part of the village , a small group of Palmach soldiers came and took it without a single casualty . Begin 's failure to even mention the Palmach is only one of the major inaccuracies ( to use a kind word ) in his account . Incidentally , `` three times as heavy '' may be correct , as there is serious evidence that the Arab loss was closer to 120 lives than to the oft-quoted 250 lives . However , note that Begin compares wounded Jews to dead Arabs . He fails to mention the number of wounded Arabs . Guess why . > was thus very severe .

No , that 's the nice thing -- on a multitasking OS , SCSI can use both drives at once . I 've got unix loaded on one of my pcs ( along with windogs ) and the OS can only use one of the two IDE drives at one time . It 's pretty ugly . I just bought at Quantum 240 for my mac at home . I paid $ 369 for it . I have n't seen IDE drives cheaper . : The original CGA cart back in '84 was $ 300 . I think the original EGA card : ( or PGA ? ) was $ 800 . SCSI has stood relatively alone in not coming down : in price , mainly because we 're talking about PC 's and not Sun 's or Sparc : or SGI or ( name your favorite unix workstation ) . That is , after millions : of PC buying decisions over the years , SCSI has had plenty of time to : come down in price . No , actually , we 're talking about SCSI being expensive simply because nobody did a common interface for the PC . If they had a common ( read : easily implemented ) method of adding scsi to a PC ( like as in a Sun or Mac ) , then you 'd find SCSI the connection medium of choice . : I wo n't argue that the SCSI standard makes for a good , well implimented : data highway , but I still want to know why it intrinsically better : ( than IDE , on an ISA bus ) when it comes to multi-tasking OS 's when : managing data from a single SCSI hard drive . On a single drive , SCSI is more expensive . But , you bought your PC for expandibility , so , you 'd want to add more drives or whatever . The following are why I find SCSI intrinsically better than IDE : A ( partial ? ) list : 1 . You can add many different types of devices and access them concurrently . 2 . A SCSI device works on many different machines ( I have a mac and a PC at home and moving hard drives between them is VERY nice with SCSI -- hook them up and away they go ) 3 . SCSI devices work together better than IDE devices . For instance , recently , I added an older connor 100 meg IDE to a maxtor 212 meg IDE . The connor *MUST* be setup as the slave . It will work no other way . On SCSI , you set the address , check the termination , plug it in , and away it goes . 4 . I have a problem with IDE 's mutual exclusion - I notice that the time it takes to switch from accessing drive c : to drive d : is quite long as compared to the time it takes to switch from drive c : to d : on a SCSI system . Under a multitasking OS , this is very noticable , as many things can be going on at once . One neat thing that I 've noticed lately ( a fringe benefit ) has been the ability to add older ( almost dead ) drives as storage on a SCSI system with little problem -- we 've got a bunch of almost dead 20 meg drives that I've added to my PC . I 've now got the interface full , but , it does allow me to have 4 20 meg drives , 1 240 meg drive , 1 tape drive , and 1 105 meg drive all on the same card . Simply put , SCSI is handier than IDE .

I understand ( from an unreliable source ) that Canseco was considered expendable by the A 's when he refused to accept any coaching about his batting stance . The A 's brain trust came to believe that his back problems were exacerbated , if not caused , by having a wide open stance , closing it quickly and then swinging with a lot of torque ( that 's a paraphrase of what I remember ) . In any event , Canseco took the road that he and he alone would decide his stance , and the A 's began to believe that he would either reinjure himself or begin to lose his ability to hit for both average and power . > Aside from salting away a large sum of a cash that I could never touch , > so that I 'd never have to work again , I 'd restructure my entire swing .

It amazes me that you have the audacity to say that human creation was not the result of the natural process of evolution ( but rather an `` act of God '' ) and then in the same post say that these other processes ( volcanos et al . ) are natural occurrences .

I recently bought a Micron 486DX/33 VLB computer and the the local bus ide card was getting around 1k/s transfer rates ( says norton ) . I caled micron because this seemed pathetically slow and they said that norton 6.xx does n't recognize local bus and wo n't give accurate results .

But , then , that was in BN times ( Before Net ) . So , here are some references . See Robin Lane Fox 's _The unauthorized version_ , ( p.284 ) where Lane Fox writes , `` ... the one passage which appears to [ comment on Jesus ' career ] is agreed to be a Christian addition . '' In my Re : Albert Sabin response ( C5u7sJ.391 @ sunfish.usd.edu ) to Jim Lippard ( 21 April 93 ) , I noted that consensus is typically indicated subtly as in Elaine Pagel 's _The gnostic gospels_ ( p.85 ) , to wit : `` A comment *attributed* to Josephus reports ... [ emphasis mine ] '' . Scholars sometimes do not even mention the two Josephus entries , another subtlety reflecting consensus . So far as I can deduce , today 's consensus is built on at least three things : 1 ) the long passage is way out of context , 2 ) Origen did not know about the long passage , and 3 ) the short and long passages are contradictory . I do n't know the references wherein the arguments which led to consensus are orginally developed ( does anyone ? ) . Biblical scholars as I defined them include theologians and historians . The former , like the latter , incorporate historical , social , technological and ideological contexts as well as theology . So the distinction is blurred . I did n't elaborate on that . Sorry . ( In turn , historians are compelled to incorporate theology ) . Ca n't say about the number of copies . These were , however , BG times ( Before Gutenburg ) . A hundred first editions seems exceedingly high ; counting on one hand seems more reasonable . Perhaps those mss . without the long insert ( if any , because anything is possible ) have been destroyed . Such a practice is certainly not foreign to religions . Anyway , all we have are mss . which have the two entries . Lippart ( in the message noted above ) talks about an Arabic ms . But here the ms. date is critical . : - ) Rich Fox , Anthro , Usouthdakota

Some more details would be appreciated . | > | > cheers Actually not . Brett himself has actually posted the data previously . What declined from 84 to 89 , as I remember it , was _percent increase_in_deficit_growth , i.e . the rate of growth of the deficit ( 2nd derivative of total deficit with respect of to time ) decreased . Brett apparently has numbed himself into thinking that the deficit declined . If you keep spending more than you earn , the deficit keeps growing . If you keep _borrowing_ at a lesser rate than you borrowed previously , the deficit increases . You only decrease deficits when your income exceeds spending and you use the difference to pay off debts . Figgie 's book paints the real data , pictorially , in gory detail . Each president , essentially ran up twice as much total debt , in half the time . Reagan/congress was simply awful . Bush/congress was unbelievable . As a really rigorous aside to this thread ... .. During pledge night the other night on the public channel , there was an '' economist '' who gave an hour or so presentation . His data was predictive and based largely on population data . I do n't know his name , but his arguments were brilliant . He confirmed , with data , what many of us know with common sense -- the boom of the 80 's has nothing to do with government policy , particularly `` supply side '' policy , since taxes do not `` cause '' economic activities . People cause economic activity . More can be explained by watching population waves roll through the years and create cycles . He has made models and predictions for years well into the middle of next century . It will be neat to see how accurate he is . Paul Collacchi

For a start there are enough current versions of the Bible to make comparisons to show that what you write above is utter garbage . Witness JW , Mormon , Catholic , Anglican , and Greek Orthodox Bibles . But to really convince you I 'd have to take you to a good old library . In our local library we had a 1804 King James which I compared to a brand new , hot of God 's tongue Good News Bible . Genesis was almost unrecognisable , many of the discrepencies between the four gospels had been edited from the Good News Bible . In fact the God of Good News was a much more congenial fellow I must say . If you like I 'll get the 1804 King James out again and actually give you some quotes .

Nixon extensively used the NSA to watch people because he did n't like them . According to _Decrypting the Puzzle Palace_ : Presumably , the NSA is restricted from conducting American surveillance by both the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 ( FISA ) and a series of presidential directives , beginning with one issued by President Ford following Richard Nixon 's bold misuse of the NSA , in which he explicitly directed the NSA to conduct widespread domestic surveillance of political dissidents and drug users . Of course , just because there are laws saying the gov't is not supposed to conduct illegal surveillance does n't mean those laws ca n't be broken when they are in the way . Doug Holland

Installing second IDE drive Organization : SURAnet , College Park , MD , USA , NA , Earth , Milky Way Lines : 44 NNTP-Posting-Host : azathoth.sura.net Recently my cousin got a second internal IDE drive ( a Seagate 210MB , I can look up the model number if it 's important ) and I 've been trying to help him install it .

I 've managed to get one or the other drive up ( with the other disconnected ) , but not both at the same time ; whenever I try , the thing hangs during bootup - never gets past the system test . The IDE controller 's instruction sheet says it supports two drives ; I think I 've configured the CMOS correctly ; the power 's plugged in properly ; I even learned about the master/slave relationship that two HDs are supposed to have ( didn't know PCs were into S & M ! 8^ ) and I think I configured the jumpers properly ( the 85MB one is the master , the new 210MB one is the slave ) . The only thing I can think of is maybe I 'm doing the cabling wrong . I've tried several combinations : controller - master - slave controller - slave - master master - controller - slave None of them worked . Unfortunately , I ca n't think of any others . Another possibility is that the 85MB one is already partitioned into two seperate drives , C and D , and the CMOS asks for `` C : drive '' and `` D : drive '' setup info rather than `` drive 1 '' and `` drive 2 '' like most others I 've seen . Could this be confusing things ? So , I need HELP ! The drive came bereft of any docs , except for some info for the CMOS setup ; the controller has a little piece of paper about the size of an index card ; I cannibalized the cable ( it 's one of those with a connector at each end and the one in the middle , so it looks like a serial connection ) ; now I be lost !

TRANSLATION The Vedas deal mainly with the subject of the three modes of material nature . O Arjuna , become transcendental to these three modes . Be free from all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and safety , and be established in the self . PURPORT All material activities involve actions and reactions in the three modes of material nature . They are meant for fruitive results , which cause bondage in the material world . The Vedas deal mostly with fruitive activities to gradually elevate the general public from the field of sense gratification to a position on the transcendental plane . Arjuna , as a student and friend of Lord Krsna , is advised to raise himself to the transcendental position of Vedanta philosophy where , in the beginning , there is brahma-jijnasa , or questions on the supreme transcendence . All the living entities who are in the material world are struggling very hard for existence . For them the Lord , after creation of the material world , gave the Vedic wisdom advising how to live and get rid of the material entanglement . When the activities for sense gratification , namely the karma-kanda chapter , are finished , then the chance for spiritual realization is offered in the form of the Upanisads , which are part of different Vedas , as the Bhagavad-gita is a part of the fifth Veda , namely the Mahabharata . The Upanisads mark the beginning of transcendental life . As long as the material body exists , there are actions and reactions in the material modes . One has to learn tolerance in the face of dualities such as happiness and distress , or cold and warmth , and by tolerating such dualities become free from anxieties regarding gain and loss . This transcendental position is achieved in full Krsna consciousness when one is fully dependent on the good will of Krsna . Bhagavad-Gita As It is Books of A.C.

'' * The WITNESS Of The APOSTLE PAUL : 1 Corinthians 15:1-26 1 Now I make known to you , brethren , the gospel which I preached to you , which also you received , in which also you stand , 2 by which also you are saved , if you hold fast the word which I preached to you , unless you believed in vain . 3 For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received , that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures , 4 and that He was buried , and that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures , ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 5 and that He appeared to Cephas , then to the twelve . 6 After that He appeared to more than five hundred brethren at one time , most of whom remain until now , but some have fallen asleep ; 7 then He appeared to James , then to all the apostles ; 8 and last of all , as it were to one untimely born , He appeared to me also . 9 For I am the least of the apostles , who am not fit to be called an apostle , because I persecuted the church of God . 10 But by the grace of God I am what I am , and His grace toward me did not prove vain ; but I labored even more than all of them , yet not I , but the grace of God with me . 11 Whether then it was I or they , so we preach and so you believed . 12 Now if Christ is preached , that He has been raised from the dead , how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead ? 13 But if there is no resurrection of the dead , not even Christ has been raised ; 14 and if Christ has not been raised , then our preaching is vain , your faith also is vain . 15 Moreover we are even found to be false witnesses of God , because we witnessed against God that He raised Christ , whom He did not raise , if in fact the dead are not raised . 16 For if the dead are not raised , not even Christ has been raised ; 17 and if Christ has not been raised , your faith is worthless ; you are still in your sins . 18 Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished . 19 If we have hoped in Christ in this life only , we are of all men most to be pitied . 20 BUT NOW CHRIST HAS BEEN RAISED FROM THE DEAD , the first fruits of those who are asleep . 21 For since by a man came death , by a man also came the resurrection of the dead . 22 For as in Adam all die , so also in Christ all shall be made alive . 23 But each in his own order : Christ the first fruits , after that those who are Christ 's at His coming , 24 then comes the end , when He delivers up the kingdom to the God and Father , when He has abolished all rule and all authority and power . 25 For He must reign until He has put all His enemies under His feet . 26 The last enemy that will be abolished is death . LOGICAL PROOFS OF JESUS CHRIST 'S RESURRECTION 1 . Jesus 's enemies *would not* have stolen His body because that would have perpetrated the resurrection -- the very opposite of what they desired . 2 . Jesus ' disciples *could not* have stolen His body because Pontius Pilate established guards to stand watch over the tomb lest His body be stolen . 3 . Sadly ( and ironically ) , many of Jesus ' disciples did not believe in the Resurrection until Jesus had risen from the dead . 4 . In nearly 20 centuries , no body has ever been produced to refute Jesus ' assertion that He *would indeed* rise from the dead . 5 . The probability of being able to perpetrate such a hoax successfully upon the entire world for nearly 20 centuries is astronomically negative ! ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following is from a critique of a `` 60 Minutes '' presentation on MSG which was aired on November 3rd , 1991 . The critique comes from THE TUFTS DIET AND NUTRITION LETTER , February 1992 . [ ... edited for brevity ... ] '' Chances are good that if you watched '60 Minutes ' last November 3rd [ 1991 ] , you came away feeling MSG is bad for you . [ ... ] In the segment entitled 'No MSG , ' for instance , show host Ed Bradley makes alarming statements without adequately substantiating them ( 'millions are suffering a host of symptoms , and some get violently sick ' ) ; peppers his report with sensational but clinically unproven personal testimony ... ; and speaks of studies on MSG that make the substance seem harmful without explaining just how inconclusive those studies are . Consider his making reference at the beginning of the program to a study conducted at the Eastern Virginia Medical School in order to back up his comment that there is ' a lot of evidence ' that MSG , a flavor enhancer in Chinese and other Asian cuisines as well as in many supermarket items , causes headaches . What he does NOT make reference to is the fact that the study was performed not on humans but on rabbits . One of the researchers who conducted the study , pharmacologist Patricia Williams , Ph.D. , says it certainly is conceivable that a small minority of people are sensitive enough to MSG to get headaches from it . 'But , ' she explains , 'the show probably overemphasized the extent of the problem . ' A second lapse comes with mention of Dr. John Olney , a professor at the Washington University School of Medicine who , Mr. Bradley remarks , 'says that his 20 years of research with laboratory animals shows MSG is a hazard for developing youngsters ' because it poses a threat of irreversible brain damage . Dr. Olney's research with lab animals does not 'show ' anything about human youngsters . In fact , only under extreme circumsrtances did Dr. Olney 's experiments ever bring about any brain damage : when he injected extremely high doses of MSG into rodents , completely bypassing their digestive tracts and entering their bloodstreams more directly , and when he used tubes to force-feed huge amounts of the substance to very young animals on an empty stomach . Of course , neither of those procedures occurs with humans ; they simply take in MSG with food . And most of what they take in is broken down by enzymes in the wall of the small intestine , so that very little reaches the bloodstream -- much to little , in fact , for human blood levels of MSG to come anywhere near the high concentrations found in Dr. Olney 's lab animals ... .. The World Health Organization appears to be very much aware of that fact . And so does the European Communities ' Scientific Committee for Food ... .Both , after examining numerous studies , have concluded that MSG is safe . Their determination makes sense , considering that MSG has never been proven to cause all the symptoms that have been attributed to it -- headaches , swelling , a tightness in the chest , and a burning sensation , among others . In fact , the most fail-safe of clinical studies , the double-blind study ... , has consistently exonerated the much-maligned substance . That 's quite fortunate since the alleged hazardous component of monosodium glutamate , glutamate , enters our systems whenever we eat any food that contains protein . The reason is that one of the amino acids that make up protein , glutamic acid , is broken down into glutamate during digestion . It 's a breakdown that occurs frequently . Glutamic acid is the most abundant of the 20 or so amino acids in the diet . It makes up about 15 percent of the protein in flesh foods , 20 percent in milk , 25 percent in corn , and 29 percent in whole wheat . That does n't mean it 's entirely unimaginable that a small number of people have trouble metabolizing MSG properly and are therefore sensitive to it ... The consensus reached by large , international professional organizations [ is that MSG is safe ] , the same consensus reached by the FDA and the biomedical community at large .

I have used Glockenspeil commonview under Motif and OS2 . I wrote a resource converter from OS2 to Motif , but it really was n't too easy , especially the naming scheme . In Motif you can not rename controls/widgets . With windows you can call the OK button ID_OK in every instance , this does n't work for Motif , you 'd have to call it Dialog1_OK , and Motif expects a text string rather than a number . So your constructor should know how to convert a # define into the proper resource identifier . I 'd check on how the toolkit expects names , and that if it does use resources , that is uses resources for all platforms you intend to port to .

There many people alive today who were born in > a city called Konstantinoupolis . I know it does n't make sense , but since when is 'Napoleon ' about sense , anyway ? Further striking bigoted and racist attitude of certain Greeks still exists in our day . Most Greeks insist even today , that the 537 year-old capital of the Ottoman Empire should be called not by its rightful name of Istanbul , but by its half a millennium-old moniker 'Cons* ( whatever ) . ' Everyone knows that New York City was once called 'New Amsterdam' but Dutch people do not persist on calling it that today . The name of Stalingrad too is long gone , replaced by Volgagrad . China's Peking traded its name for Beiging long ago . Ciudad Trujillo of the Dominican Republic is now Santa Domingo . Zimbabve's old colonial capital Salisburry became Harrare . These changes have all been accepted officially by everyone in the world . But , Greeks are still determined on calling the Turkish Istanbul by the name of 'Cons* . ' How can one explain this total intransigence ? What makes Greeks so different from other mortals ? 18-year-old questionable democracy ? Why do n't they seem to reconcile with the fact , for instance , that Istanbul changed hands 537 years ago in 1453 AD , and that this predates the discovery of the New World , by 39 years . The declaration of U.S. independence in 1776 will come 284 years later . Should n't then , half a millennium be considered enough time for 'Cons* ' to be called a Turkish city ? Where is the logic in the Greek reasoning , if there is any ? How long can one sit on the laurels of an ancient civilization ? Ancient Greece does not exist , any more than any other 16 civilizations that existed on the soil of Anatolia . These undereducated 'wieneramus ' live with an illusion . It is the same mentality which allows them to rationalize that Cyprus is a Greek Island . No history book shows that it ever was . It belonged to the Ottoman Turks 'lock , stock and barrel ' for a period of well over 300 years . In fact , prior to the Turks ' acquisition of it , following bloody naval battles with the Venetians in 1570 AD , the island of Cyprus belonged , invariably , to several nations : The Assyrians , the Sumerians , the Phoenicians , the Egyptians , the Ottoman Turks , of course in that order , owned it as their territory . But , it has never been the possession of the government of Greece - not even for one day - in the history of the world . Moreover , Cyprus is located 1500 miles from the Greek mainland , but only 40 miles from Turkiye 's southern coastline . Saddam Hussein claims that Kuwait was once Iraqi territory and the Greek Cypriot government and the terrorist Greek governments think that Cyprus also was once part of the Greek hegemony . Those 'Arromdians ' involved in this grandiose hallucination should wake up from their sweet daydreams and confront reality . Again , wishful thinking is unproductive , only facts count . As for Selanik , < < Those Jews who survived these assaults in Southeastern Europe fled particularly to Salonica , whose Jewish population increased substantially as a result , from 28,000 in 1876 to 90,000 in 1908 , more than half the total population , though even there increased persecution by local Greeks led many Jews to flee elsewhere in the Ottoman Empire , particularly to the great port of Izmir . Despite all the pressure from Ottomans and foreign Jews alike , the ritual murders and other assaults by Christians on Jews went on and on . Greek efforts to decimate the Jewish population of Salonica culminated in 1912 and 1913 , following Greek conquest of Salonica during the first Balkan War , when many of its Jews , were either killed or terrorized into leaving ... > > < < Though Greece was obligated by the post World War I treaties to allow Jews and other minorities to use their own languages in education and to practice their religions without hindrance , a law was issued in 1923 which forbad all inhabitants from working on Sunday , stimulating a new Jewish exodus as it was intended to do . Between 1932 and 1934 there was a series of anti-Semitic riots in Salonica , with the Cambel quarter , where most of the remaining Jews lived , being burned to the ground . This was followed by regulations requiring the use of Greek and prohibiting Hebrew and Judea-Spanish in the Jewish schools . A start was made also on expropriating the land of the principal Jewish cemetery in Salonica for use by the new University in order to derive the Jews out [ 47 ] . By killing and driving out large numbers of Jews , the Greeks left a substantial Greek majority in the city for the first time , and starting Salonica Jewry on the way to its final decimation by the Nazis during the occupation of Greece starting in 1941 . Salonica and Izmir of course were not the only places of refuge for Jewish refugees entering the Empire during its last century of existence . Istanbul , Edirne , and other parts of Rumelia and Anatolia received thousands more . Nor were Jews the only refugees received and helped by the government of the Sultan . Thousands of Muslims accompanied them in flight from similar persecutions wherever Balkan christian states gained independence or expanded . The Russian conquest of the Crimea and the Caucasus starting in the late eighteenth century , and particularly during and after the Crimean War , combined with the same independence movements in Southeastern Europe that had caused so much suffering and flight among its Jews caused thousands of helpless , ill , and poverty-stricken Muslim refugees to accompany them into the ever shrinking boundaries of the Ottoman Empire , with the Istanbul government struggling mightly but vainly to house and feed them as best it could . From 1850 to 1864 as many as 800,000 Crimean Tatars , Circassians , and other Muslims from north and east of the Black Sea had entered Anatolia alone , as many as 200,000 more came during the next twenty years , while 474,389 refugees entered in 1876- 1877 as a result of the Ottoman wars with Russia and the Balkan states , with an equal number gaining refuge in the European portions of the Empire. > > [ 47 ] Robert Mantran , 'La structure sociale de la communaute juive de Salonqiue a la fin du dix-neuvieme siecle ' , RH no.534 ( 1980 ) , 391-92 ; Nehama VII , 762 ; Joseph Nehama ( Salonica ) to AIU ( Paris ) no.2868/2 , 12 May 1903 ( AIU Archives I-C-43 ) ; and no.2775 , 10 January 1900 ( AIU Archives I-C-41 ) , describing daily battles between Jewish and Greek children in the streets of Salonica .

Lines : 15 Well , Maddux looked excellent as the Braves shutout the Cubs 1 - 0 . Justice drove in the only run with an RBI single in the first . Get ready for him to have a monster year . He is now hitting the ball to the opposite field with a lot of power to go with his natural power to right field and his good batting eye . If he stays healthy which he should ( his back is full strength this year ) he should get over 100 RBI and close to 30 HR . In another note , the Marlins got off to a good start beating the Dodgers . I believe the score was 6 - 3 but I 'm not sure . I wish them and the Rockies well this year . Hell . I think it would be funny to watch the Dodgers hit the cellar again this year . Dan Smith

I have managed to make a chessboard for Rayshade . Unfortunately I still have to do the knight ( horse ) . Any ideas ? I am also looking for a surface for the chesspieces . The board is marble . Unfortunately black wo n't work very well for the one side . Anybody with ideas for nice surfaces ? I would also like to use the image command of rayshade and the heightfield command . Unfortunately the manual is very vague about this , and I do n't have Craig Kolb 's email address . Anybody with ideas , because this is essential for my next venture into raytracing .

From : hbrooks @ uiatma.atmos.uiuc.edu ( Harold_Brooks ) Subject : RBI , RISP , and SLG Organization : Bill 's Safety Cab and Record Bar , Chickasha , OK Lines : 49 Off and on over the last several months , threads about RBIs and related topics have gotten me to thinking about how well we can predict a player 's RBIs using information about his overall performance and the number of runners in scoring position ( RISP ) that he bats with . In the Brock2 model , Bill James calculated predicted RBIs as RBI=.235* ( Total Bases ) + Home Runs . This completely ignores the context , which was all that Brock2 could do , since context was unknown to it . So I thought I'd take that idea as a starting point and look how good a fit to the data you get by comparing ( RBI-Home Runs ) to SLG*RISP . I 've started with team data , using data from the Elias 's that I 've picked up over the years when a ) I could afford them and b ) I could stomach the thought of increasing Elias 's profits . That gave me the years 1984-1986 , 1988 , and 1990 . ( I do n't have team RBIs for '87 or I could add that year . ) If you run a simple least squares fit to the data you get ( RBI-Home Runs ) = 0.81*SLG*RISP . The correlation between the LHS and the RHS is 0.86 , which is significant at a ridiculously high level . So , I feel like the fit is good at the team level . I 've no started to move on to the player level and have looked at 4 players ( Will Clark , Ozzie Smith , Joe Carter , and Don Mattingly ) . I hope to add quite a few more during my copious free time this year . It does n't do too badly , except the equation underpredicts the low HR hitter ( Smith ) , which may be a fault of the model or it could just be Ozzie . The results : RBI-HR Years Actual Predicted Carter ( 84-88,90 ) 400 402.6 Clark ( 87,88,90,92 ) 269 269.6 Matt'ly ( 84-88,90 ) 471 460.8 Smith ( 84-88,90 ) 317 280.6 I think we can make a case ( and I hope to make it stronger ) that RBIs can be predicted simply from knowing how a player slugs overall and how many men are in scoring position when he comes up .

In the first place the clipper chip must have existed for several years as a defense project . Therefore this is not a party matter at all . George Bush was in any case hardly adverse to tapping calls , he was chief spook remember . Secondly the govt can quite easily apply pressure . They simply `` ask '' their chums who they give huge defense contracts to ( motorola etc ) to be `` nice '' boys . After all Bill is giving them a nice little trade monopoly since the chips wo n't be avaliable to foreign firms . Thirdly the people who consider the Democrats to be socialist are not the same as the ones who consider socialists to be communist . People might know this if the US education system did not suffer from the Mcarthyite and Dewy version of political correctness - the sort with tribunals and show trials . Ever seen Ed Meese pissed ? I have , it was when he said that socialism and communism were the same thing and brought the house down with laughter . It took several minutes before we realised that he was serious .

Her son traded the car in ( and I checked -- not the same car ) . So I have some evidence of a reoccuring problem with the V6 in the Probe GT 's , and by extension with the Madza 626 and MX-6 .

The National Hockey League should love the idea , though . > Pan-European TV channels such as Eurosport could bring in the millions the > American networks likely never will pay . This brings up a question I asked myself ( no answer ) when it was mentionned that the NHL could expand in Europe . Would most of the North-americans now playing in the NHL be willing to play for a team in Europe ? I do not think that the majority of hockey players are necessarily interested in expanding their cultural experience to that level . ( I know I would but I am not a pro hockey player ) When one recalls some players remarks in the last few years it makes me wonder how a European expansion could be achieved . Remember these : - Lindros did not want to play in Quebec ( for more than $ reasons ) - Nicholls ... in Edmonton . - R. Courtnall wanted to be traded to LA only . - C. Lemieux said he would refuse to go to Edmonton earlier this year . I know there are many non-cultural reasons behind these but there is more : - Some american players who played for the Expos complained about the french fact and that the city was not quite like the other US cities . One players ' wife trying to make her point went on to complain that she could not even find her favorite brand of nacho chips in Montreal . Anybody knows what happened when all these US football players moved to London , Spain , etc .. for the one year of that new football league ( 2 years ago ? ) I wonder what the players association thinks about going to Europe . Myself I would like to see some European teams , but what would be the best way to do it ? Marc

I 'd really like to know . BTW , Sherri , thanks for > the DA data I find it fascinating . Of course a run scored is just as important as a run prevented . Just as a penny saved is a penny earned . Enough with the cliches . My point is that IF the Braves starters are able to live up to their potential , they wo n't need much offensive support . I realize this is a BIG IF . This staff leaves the '92 BoSox in the dust . There is no legitimate comparison . Two Cy Young winners , and three other pitchers that most any team in the league would kill to have as their first or second starter . It seems to me that when quality pitchers take the mound , the other teams score less runs . The team that scores the most runs wins . This puts the team with the better pitching at the advantage ( providing they can stop the opposing team from scoring runs ) . A low scoring game would clearly benefit the Braves . They should have many low scoring games due to their excellent pitching and below average hitting . On the flip side , if you had a starting lineup of great offensive players , I would be arguing that this team would not need great pitchers . They would have an advantage because they could simply outscore their opponent . The name of the games is to win . Even Ray Knight knows that you do this by putting more runs up on the scoreboard . All I 'm trying to say is that if you assemble the quality pitchers like the Braves have , the offense does n't need to be as strong . Sam > > -Dave > > > > Sherri Nichols > > snichols @ adobe.com >

This is a great strain to our friendship ... Sorry to disappoint you , but I 'm afraid your friendship is in danger . Perhaps you should examine in yourself why as such a good friend , you are unwilling to accept this imortant part of your friends life ? Why do you call into question his faith ? Your friend has changed , he has found something that fills a need in his life . You need to decide if you are still his friend , whether you can accommodate his new life . It sounds as if you are criticizing him for a fundamental belief in the Bible , yet you are quick to reveal that your fundamental belief that it is superstition . Perhaps if he knew you at least took him seriously , that you at least took an interest in the light he has found , that you at least tried to understand what has become a special part of his life , you could together decide to become fundamentalists , respect each others differences and remain friends , or part ways . Maybe even if you stuck it out with him , you could help him to un-convert . Of course , if you go in with that attitude he will surely see through your intentions and begin to resent you . I happen to be a person very tolerant of fundamentalists , because I know that the idea of a simple black and white approach to life is appealing . I do n't happen to share the beliefs of fundamentalists , but I am not offended by their prosyletizing . I had a few good conversations with some Witnesses who came to my door . I did n't switch my beliefs , but for those at home who maybe need a friendly face to invite them somewhere , the Witnesses provide a wonderful service . You may have been conditioned to believe that religion is unimportant and witnessing is obnoxious , but why ? Are you afraid you might be converted and become one of them , that you will be swept up in fundamentalism , that you will become a weirdo . Friendship 's a two-way street . You must respect your friend , ALL of him , including his beliefs , if you want the friendship to continue . Joe Moore

The referendum Sunday is expected to establish a British/American style first-past-the-post system in the Senate . If implemented , it would encourage a two- ( or perhaps three- ) party system in Italy . Most likely the DC and PSI will not be these parties ; rather there will be a shakeup of the entire party structure from which 2 new parties will emerge to dominate . Will Lega Nord be one of these ? Who knows . ( The Camera dei Deputati ( lower house ) will likely remain with Proportional Representation for a while , but there is talk of switching a portion of that house , too . Maybe as much as 40 % first-past-the-post ) Overall , the electoral reform in Italy is a welcome change . Italians are tired of having crappy government .

Let me make clear that the `` Law '' is none other than the Pentateuch of Genesis , Exodus , Leviticus , Numbers , Deuteronomy . What did Jesus say about the `` Law '' in Matt5:14-19 ?

Who says Gentile Christians are not covered by the first five books ? Who says that Gentile Christians are above the Ten Commandments ? > Jesus dealt mostly with Jews . I think we can reasonably assume that > Mat 5 was directed to a Jewish audience . You 're implying that Jesus ' words are valid only for Jews . Is this really what you mean to say ? You do realize that you are gutting rather large portions of the Bible ? When you read Jesus ' words , did you ever consider that maybe , just maybe Jesus is talking to you , no matter what your race or sex ? If the Hebrew Scriptures and the Gospel accounts of Jesus are only directed to Jews , why were they translated into English ? > He did interact with > Gentiles a few times ( e.g . the centurion whose slave was healed and a > couple of others ) . The terms used to describe the centurion ( see Luke > 7 ) suggest that he was a `` God-fearer '' , i.e . a Gentile who followed > God , but had not adopted the whole Jewish Law .

Are you Christian or Pauline ? > Paul 's comments are not the world 's clearest here , and not everyone > agrees with my reading . You acknowledge that it is *your* reading of Paul .

Has circumcision been superceded for Christians ? ... . Are you Christian or Pauline ? [ Both . There is no doubt in my mind about what is sin and what is not , at least not in this case . Jesus did not deal explicitly with the question of whether the Law was binding on Gentiles . That 's why I have to cite evidence such as the way Jesus dealt with the Centurion . As to general Jewish views on this , I am dependent largely on studies of Pauline theology , one by H.J . Schoeps , and one whose author I can't come up with at the moment . Both authors are Jews . Also , various Christian and non-Christian Jews have discussed the issue here and in other newsgroups . Mat 5:19 is clear that the Law is still valid . It does not say that it applies to Gentiles . And yes , I say that the specific requirement for worship on the Sabbath in the Ten Commandments is a ceremonial detail , when you're looking at the obligations of Gentiles . Similarly circumcision . I 'm not sure quite what else I can say on this subject . Again , it's unfortunate the Jesus did n't answer the question directly . However we do know ( 1 ) what the 1st Cent . Jewish approach was , ( 2 ) how Jesus dealt with at least one Gentile , and ( 3 ) how Jesus ' disciples dealt with the issue when it became more acute ( I 'm referring to Acts 15 more than Paul ) . Given that these are all in agreement , I do n't see that there 's a big problem . -- clh ]

I do n't know , however , if this is a characteristic of the tookits , or just poor aestetic taste in the programmers . I would like my app to look a little more `` sculptured '' like mwm . I understand , however , that mwm is n't free like the other tookits . I am getting Linux , so I will have InterViews , but I do n't know how it will look . I get the impression Andrew is from the FSF , but I don't know what it looks like either . If you can help explain this toolkit mess to me , I would be much obliged . Which are free ? Which are the best ? Which are portable ? Which looks nice ? Which is not a resource hog ? Also , if you happen to know which are available on Linux and/or Sun , that would be a big help too . Thanks in advance .

Organization : Brunel University , Uxbridge , UK Lines : 62 Robert Anderson ( randerso @ acad1.sahs.uth.tmc.edu ) wrote : : I would like to get your opinions on this : when exactly does an engaged : couple become `` married '' in God 's eyes ? Some say that if the two have : publically announced their plans to marry , have made their vows to God , and : are unswervingly committed to one another ( I realize this is a subjective : qualifier ) they are married/joined in God 's sight . The way I read Scripture , a couple becomes married when they are *physically* married , i.e . when they first have sexual intercourse . e.g . the end of Genesis 2 ( quoted from memory ) `` for this reason , a man shall leave his parents and be joined to his wife , and they will become one flesh '' ( Jesus also quotes this scripture referring to marriage ) . If you read through Genesis in particular , you will often come across the phraseology : `` [ man ] lay with [ woman ] , and she became his wife '' . This implies that she became his wife when they lay together , i.e . at the point of intercourse . Compare this with Jewish tradition : Joseph , when he heard that Mary was pregnant , had it in mind to divorce her quietly -- but Mary and Joseph were *betrothed* , not married . i.e. , they were in a binding relationship ( which required a divorce to get out of ) , but *marriage* would not occur until Mary and Joseph went to bed together . Compare with Christ and the Church ( Ephesians 5 , Revelation 19 ) : the church is described as the `` bride '' of Christ , but the *marriage* of the Lamb takes place when Jesus returns . i.e. , we are in a binding love-relationship with Jesus , but we are still looking forward to the time when the marriage will take place . I see this as the spiritual equivalent of sexual intercourse , because it represents the most intimate fellowship possible between man and God . In summary , engagement should be honoured as a binding relationship , but it is not marriage . A civil ceremony is not marriage either . Marriage occurs at the point when the betrothed couple go to bed together . ( I do n't mean to demean the civil or church ceremony -- ours was great ! I do n't mean to be too pedantic . ) Historically , I think I am correct in stating that the civil ceremony ( i.e . a marriage recognised by the state ) , has only been around in the West since Napoleon , who introduced it to keep tabs on the people ( although I 'm ready to be corrected on that point ! ) This view obviously raises some questions : What about those who have had sex with one or more partners , without considering marriage . Are those people also `` married '' ? If it is true that marriage occurs at the point of intercourse , is it necessary to be married in the eyes of the state ? ( I would say Yes , because this honours the laws of our nations in the West . Although it is not illegal to sleep together though unmarried in most Western countries , I believe that it is God- honouring to proclaim our marriage to the state and to our friends before actually consummating our marriage . Its to do with our being salt and light , and also to do with how people will perceive us ; i.e . it is culturally insensitive to declare yourself married without going through a civil ceremony . ) -- -- -- - Michael Davis ( cs89mcd @ brunel.ac.uk ) And hast thou slain the Jabberwock ?

From : jgreen @ trumpet.calpoly.edu ( James Thomas Green ) Subject : Keeping Spacecraft on after Funding Cuts . Organization : California Polytechnic State University , San Luis Obispo Lines : 51 Why do spacecraft have to be shut off after funding cuts . For example , Why could n't Magellan just be told to go into a `` safe '' mode and stay bobbing about Venus in a low-power-use mode and if maybe in a few years if funding gets restored after the economy gets better ( hopefully ) , it could be turned on again . For that matter , why exactly were the Apollo lunar experiments '' turned off '' rather than just `` safed '' . Was it political ( i.e . as along as they could be used , someone would keep bugging congress for funds ) ? Turning them off keeps them pesky scientists out of the bureaucrat 's hair ... . I 've heard the argument that an active but `` uncontrolled '' spacecraft causes `` radio noise . '' I find that hard to believe that this could be a problem in a properly designed `` safe '' mode . This safe mode could be a program routine which causes the spacecraft to go to least fuel using orientation , and once a ( week , month , year , whatever ) attempts a signal lock on Earth . At that time , if funding has been restored , the mission can continue . If no signal is recieved , the spacecraft goes back to the safe mode for another time period . As we would know when the spacecraft is going to try to contact Earth , we could be prepared if necessary . As another a spacecraft could do at the attempted contact is beam stored data towards Earth . If someone can receive it , great , if not , so it 's lost and no big deal . By making the time and signal location generally known , perhaps someone in the world might be able and willing to intercept the data even if they 're not willing to contact the spacecraft . I see this as being particularly useful for spacecraft which could have an otherwise long life and are in or are going to places which are otherwise unaccessible ( Jupiter/Saturn Orbit , exiting the solar system , etc ) . Perhaps those designing future spacecraft ( Cassini , Pluto Flyby , etc ) should consider designing in a `` pause '' mode in case their spacecraft gets the ax sometime in the future after completion of the primary mission . Perhaps Mars Observer and Galilleo could have some kind of routine written in for the post mission '' drift '' phase . So any holes in all this ? /~~~ ( - : James T.

Of course , more standards apply : 1 Timothy 4:16 People in the church should be watching their lives and doctrines to make sure they both live up to the Word entirely ( ie , disciples ) . Acts 17:10-12 The pastor does not come close to the Apostle Paul ( natural conclusion since the Apostle Paul talked with Jesus directly face to face ) , so if the Bereans , who were considered noble , did n't take Paul at his word but checked out what he said with Scripture to verify his statements , then church members are to do the same and verify the pastor 's statements . If they are not verifiable or valid in light of other verses , then that group should be avoided as a church ( would've made a wonderful suggestion to the Waco group , especially in light of Matthew 24 ) .

This is the second post which seems to be blurring the distinction between real disease caused by Candida albicans and the `` disease '' that was being asked about , systemic yeast syndrome . There is no question that Candida albicans causes thrush . It also seems to be the case that active yogurt cultures with acidophilous may reduce recurrences of thrush at least for vaginal thrush -- I 've never heard of anyone taking it for oral thrush before ( though presumably it would work by the same mechanism ) .

Turned out that the actual reading should have been 160K . Court case followed because lady said she would n't have bought a car with that much km 's .

The oft-quoted line that says people should be guaranteed life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness as inalienable rights , is a complete lie and deception , as the very authors of that line were in the process of proving . Liberty is never free , it is always purchased at some cost , almost always at the cost to another . Whos liberty is more inalienable ? Similarly for right of life . When one person must die if he is to save another , or even a group of others , whos life is more inalienable ? That leads into the classic question of the value of the death penalty , especially for serial killers . Whos life and liberty is more valuable , the serial killer , or the victim ? According to that beautiful line , those two rights should be completely inviolate , that is , noone should be able to remove them . This _includes_ government . Admittedly the serial killer has restricted some people 's life and/or liberty , but is not his own life/liberty inviolate also ? According to the declaration of independence , it is . > > > Murder is certainly a violation of the golden rule .

I 'll pose a question here that 's got me thinking : what distinguishes '' true '' religion from cults ( I 'm speaking generally here , not specifially about Christianity ) ? Jerry Falwell was on Good Morning America on Tuesday ostensibly to answer this question . Basically , he said that true religion follows a message whereas a cult follows a person . But , then , Christianity is a cult because the message of Christianity IS the person of Jesus . So what distinguishes , for example , the Branch Davidian `` cult '' from the Presbyterian `` church '' ? Doctrinal differences do n't answer the question , IMHO , so do n't use them as an answer . -- Scott at Brandeis '' But God demonstrates His `` The Lord bless you , and keep you ; own love for us , in that the Lord make His face shine on you , while we were yet sinners , and be gracious to you ; Christ died for us . '' the Lord lift up His countenance on you , and give you peace . '' -- Romans 5:8 [ NASB ] -- Numbers 6:24-26 [ NASB ] [ There have been some attempts to characterize `` cult '' . Most commonly it uses characteristics involving high pressure , brainwashing techniques , etc . But some people characterize it by doctrinal error . In the end I 'm afraid it becomes a term with no precise meaning that 's used primarily to dismiss groups as not worthy of serious consideration . That does n't mean that there aren't groups that do highly irresponsible things and have serious doctrinal errors . But past discussions have not suggested to me that `` cult '' is a very helpful term . -- clh ]

I 've been thinking about this every now and then since I cut my ties with Christianity . It is surprising to note that a large majority of people , at least in Finland , seem to be apatheists - even though 90 % of the population are members of the Lutheran Church of Finland , religious people are actually a minority . Could it be possible that many people believe in god `` just in case '' ? It seems people do not want to seek the truth ; they fall prey to Pascal's Wager or other poor arguments . A small minority of those who do believe reads the Bible regularly . The majority does n't care - it believes , but does n't know what or how . People do n't usually allow their beliefs to change their lifestyle , they only want to keep the virtual gate open . A Christian would say that they are not `` born in the Spirit '' , but this does not disturb them . Religion is not something to think about . I 'm afraid a society with a true atheist majority is an impossible dream . Religions have a strong appeal to people , nevertheless - a promise of life after death is something humans eagerly listen to . Coupled with threats of eternal torture and the idea that our morality is under constant scrutiny of some cosmic cop , too many people take the poison with a smile . Or just pretend to swallow ( and unconsciously hope god would n't notice ; - ) ) : Also , how many atheists out there would actually take the stance and accor a : higher value to their way of thinking over the theistic way of thinking . The : typical selfish argument would be that both lines of thinking evolved from the : same inherent motivation , so one is not , intrinsically , different from the : other , qualitatively . But then again a measuring stick must be drawn : somewhere , and if we can not assign value to a system of beliefs at its core , : than the only other alternative is to apply it to its periphery ; ie , how it : expresses its own selfishness . If logic and reason are valued , then I would claim that atheistic thinking is of higher value than the theistic exposition . Theists make unnecessary assumptions they believe in - I 've yet to see good reasons to believe in gods , or to take a leap of faith at all . A revelation would do . However , why do we value logic and reasoning ? This questions bears some resemblance to a long-disputed problem in science : why mathematics works ? Strong deep structuralists , like Atkins , have proposed that perhaps , after all , everything _is_ mathematics . Is usefulness any criterion ?

From : rich.bellacera @ amail.amdahl.com Subject : `` Ex-Gays ? '' ( follow-up ) Lines : 53 Return-Path : < amail.amdahl.com ! rich.bellacera @ juts.ccc.amdahl.com > I would like to apologize for the typos in the previous post . In retrospect I would also like to quote another source : Douglas C. Haldeman from his 1991 book _Homosexuality_ THERAPY INEFFECTIVE Recently the founders of yet another prominent `` ex-gay '' ministry , Exodus International , denounced their conversion therapy procedures as ineffective . Michael Busse and Gary Cooper , cofounders of Exodus International and lovers for 13 years , were involved with the organization from 1976 to 1979 . The program was described by these men as `` ineffective . . . not one person was healed . '' They stated that the program often exacerbated already prominent feelings of guilt and personal failure among the counselees ; many were driven to suicidal thoughts as a result of the failed `` reparative therapy . '' The previous article quoted in the last posting is from THE ADVOCATE , June 30 , 1992 called `` The Ex-Ex-Gay '' by Robert Pela . Some personal thoughts : It is of no great astonishment that there is a concerted effort by a major portion of the Church to control and mandate change of a minority among its ranks . This was the momentum behind the Spanish Inquisition , only all they required was a confession of faith ( after much torture ) and then , to save their souls they would dispatch them to heaven through death . Even later , the Bible was used vigorously to defend slavery , oppression and segragation of African-Americans , even to the justification of lynchings . Today 's scholars are just a bit more slick in their approach . The tool is still coersion , but now it is mostly by means of brainwashing and mind control , convincing people that they should see themselves as less than God sees them , then maintaining a cultic hold on them until it is felt thier mind-conditioning is complete . Sure , no one is `` physically '' forced to stay in this `` reparative therapy '' but sheer social pressure is enough for many to keep themselves in this new found bondage of self-hate . As an abolitionist I advocate the abolishment of oppression and persecution against gays in all facets of civil life . A person should be judged by the contibution , or non-contribution to the society in which they live , not by some high-brow standard of conformity imposed by those who haven ' ; t a clue what is in their heart . For those who seek more information about Gays and groups that accept them please contact your nearest chapter of PFLAG ( Parents & Friends of Lesbians And Gays ) who will be more than happy to assist you . This is a group of people comprised of Gays , Lesbians and Bisexuals , their parents and friends who have formed a support group for help and understanding . Try talking to a parent of a gay son or daughter and learn some `` first-hand '' real life and loving understanding . God 's love and understanding for Gay people is no less abundant . Thank you .

From : crphilli @ hound.dazixca.ingr.com ( Ron Phillips ) Subject : Randy Weaver Trial - Day 2 Nntp-Posting-Host : hound Reply-To : crphilli @ hound.dazixca.ingr.com Organization : `` Intergraph Electronics , Mountain View , CA '' Distribution : usa Lines : 89 This was posted to the firearms-politics mailing list . ============================================================== Hi Folks ; Wednesday marked day 2 , the beginning of the trial . Opening statements were given by both the prosecution and the defense , each side presenting its version of what happenned last August . The prosecution argued that Weaver and his family moved to Idaho in 1983 anticipating a battle with the `` evil '' federal government . The prosecution alleges that Weaver sold federal agents `` sawed off '' shotguns and later failed to appear for trial : Despite repeated `` good faith '' efforts to get Weaver to surrender peacefully , Weaver refused . The shootout erupted when Weaver discovered agents on a surveillance mission and began firing . According to the prosecution , three people were taking an `` offensive action '' against an FBI helicopter when an FBI sniper killed Vicki Weaver . The defense argued that Weaver and his family moved to northern Idaho in 1983 to practice their religion in peace . They wanted simply to be left alone . Weaver was induced by federal agents to sell the short-barrelled shotgun ( and did not , as the prosecution alleged , want to become a `` regular supplier '' ) . The defense also argued that the federal government sought to arrest Weaver when he would n't become an informant [ it is not specified explicitly , but I assume that this is a reference to the white separatist angle of the story . We 'll know more as things develop ] . The failure to appear in court happenned because Weaver was given an incorrect court date and then indicted before that date . The shootout occurred when federal agent Arthur Roderick killed Weaver 's dog that was in proximity to Weaver 's son , Samuel . Weaver then fired in self-defense . In the ensuing battle , federal agent William Degan was killed ( when his gun was later found , there were 7 .223 cases nearby and the gun was on semi-automatic : However , agents were near the body for an extended period of time and could have played with the select-fire - this will have to be more fully explained ) . Finally , the defense claims that Vicki Weaver was only going to `` look at the body '' [ not recover ? ] of her son when she was cut-down by an FBI sniper . Prosecution quote : `` Weaver wanted that confrontation , and he made that confrontation . '' -- Asst . U.S. Attorney Kim Lindquist Defense quote : `` The evidence in this case is going to show that this is a case where Randy Weaver and Kevin Harris are charged with crimes they did n't commit in order to cover crimes that the government did commit . '' -- Gerry Spence [ nice soundbite ! ] Notes : The _Idaho Statesman_ claims that Weaver supporters heeded a call from Spence not to repeat yesterday 's protests outside the courthouse . However , the local NBC affiliate again had footage on the 10:00 news with 5 supporters including '' Tim '' again . `` Tim '' claimed he was a skinhead , who were `` ordinary , working class people . '' He also claimed he was for `` white pride , not white power . '' Outside the courthouse the television crew had an impromptu interview with Bo Gritz , who charged that the neo-nazi protestors are exactly what the government wants to smear Randy Weaver . In an affiliated article carried in the _Idaho Statesman_ , about a dozen lawyers were among the 70 or so people packed into the courthouse . These lawyers were present to watch Gerry Spence in action , and to perhaps learn something from him . Some tidbits : Spence flatly told the jurors that he and his son Kent were volunteering their time to represent Weaver because they believed in him . Spence , during his 90-minute opening statement , repeatedly walked behind Weaver and placed his hands on the defendants shoulders ( Weaver broke down and cried during the recounting of his wife 's death ) , and Spence compared the `` sawed off '' shotgun to driving 56 mph when the limit was 55 ( another good one ! ) . Today ( Thursday , April 15th ) the prosecution was scheduled to begin presenting evidence .

Or is this your misaimed telepathy at work again ? ( 1 ) Stephen said you took a quote out of context ( 2 ) You noted that Stephen had not replied to some other t.r.m article ( call it A ) that took a quote out of context ( 3 ) But the lack of evidence for X does not constitute evidence for the lack of X ( a common creationist error ) ( 4 ) So the fact that Stephen did not reply to A does not justify the conclusion that Stephen condoned taking quotes out of context in A ( 5 ) You asked Stephen to explain why you were wrong and they were OK , or to acknowledge that he was being a hypocrite . ( 6 ) Both of the choices you give Stephen assume that he condoned taking quotes out of context in A . ( 7 ) I assumed you were being logical , and that the sentence that begins `` Could you please explain ... '' was not a nonsequitur , but was intended to follow from the sentence that preceded it . ( 8 ) Therefore , I concluded that you believed that ( 2 ) implied that Stephen condoned taking quotes out of context in A ( 9 ) But we 've already seen that ( 2 ) does not imply this ( 10 ) Therefore , you were incorrect to believe that ( 2 ) implied that Stephen thought it was okay to take quotes out of context in A , and were making an error of a kind that is frequently made by creationists . Is that better Jim ? It 's called an argument . If you disagree with it , explain why the argument is not sound . ( I admit that my assumption in ( 7 ) may have been a bit hasty . ) If you agree with it , just say `` yup . '' dj '' Yup . '' -- Jim 's e-mailed response when I pointed out , in a posted article , that one of his arguments was a straw man argument , reminiscent of a frequent creationist ploy . ( 3/22/93 )

Although not many patients with Hep B go on to chronic hepatitis , it does still occur in a good number ( 20 % ? ) and is something to keep in mind . Hepatitis C ( was : non-A , non-B Hep ) much more frequently leads to chronic hep and cirrhosis . There is also an autimmune chronic hepatitis that affects mostly younger women which also leads to cirrhosis . Of course , cirrhosis is a most unkind disease . The most dangerous effects relate to portal hypertension and loss of liver function . Patients develop life-threatening variceal bleeds and hepatic comas , among many other problems , as a result of disturbances in hepatic circulation . Less ominously , they can exhibit the effects of hyperestrogenemia which often characterize patients with cirrhosis . These effects include telangiactasias ( small red skin lesions ) and , in men , gynecomastia ( breast development ) . The only real treatment for cirrhosis is liver transplant . Keep in mind that cirrhosis is not expected , at least statistically , in your friend 's case . Nevertheless you might want to bring up the subject of chronic disease and cirrhosis with the doctor .

Distribution : usa Keywords : Gun Talk Lines : 208 April 19 , 1993 As William O. Douglas noted , `` If a powerful sponsor is lacking , individual liberty withers -- in spite of glowing opinions and resounding constitutional phrases . '' The legislative scorecard outlined below resulted from subcommittee , committee , and floor action . Many important victories , however , come from coordinating with legislators to ensure anti-gun/anti-hunting legislation is either amended favorably , rejected , or never voted . These quiet victories are no less impressive in protecting our fundamental civil liberties guaranteed by the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution . **** Arizona - SB 1233 , NRA-supported legislation concerning minors in criminal possession of firearms passed the House 36-18 , is currently awaiting action by the Governor . Arkansas - HB 1447 , Firearms Preemption Legislation was signed by the Governor making this the forty-first state to pass preemption .

Georgia - SB 12 , supposed instant check with provision allowing for up to a 7-day `` waiting period , '' defeated in House Public Safety Committee and sent to Interim Study committee . Mandatory storage bill -- SB 247 -- was defeated 39-15 in the Senate . The same bill passed the upper-House 52-2 in 1992 . Illinois - HB 90 , prohibiting the sale , possession , manufacture , purchase , possession , or carrying of certain semi-auto firearms , was defeated in House Judiciary II Subcommittee on Firearms . HB 91 , mandatory storage legislation , failed in House Judiciary Subcommittee on Firearms .

West Virginia - S.C.R . 18 , which calls for a study to control transfers of handguns and `` Assault Weapons '' was defeated in the Senate 24-10 . Wisconsin - In a referendum up against all odds , the determined efforts of the Madison Area Citizens Against Crime paid off on April 6 when a nonbinding referendum banning the possession of handguns in Madison , Wisconsin , was defeated . Despite opposition to the ban -- aired largely by firearms owners at a series of public meetings on the issue -- the Common Council voted on February 17 to place the referendum on the ballot , allowing only seven weeks of campaigning to reverse public opinion on the controversial issue . An October 1992 poll conducted by the Wisconsin State Journal found 57 % in support and 38 % opposed , with 5 % expressing no opinion . By election day , of the more than 56,000 voters who went to the polls , 51 % cast ballots in opposition to the proposal while 49 % voted to have the Madison Common Council enact such a ban . The campaign committee , spearheaded by the Wisconsin Pro-Gun Movement and NRA-ILA , relied on neighborhood canvassing , direct mail and radio/TV advertising to educate voters on the civil liberties implications raised by enforcement of the ban if the referendum was approved . Despite the surprising defeat , it is expected that the Madison initiative 's chief proponent , Mayor Paul Soglin , will attempt to have the Common Council enact an ordinance banning handguns .

From : randolin @ polisci.umn.edu ( Robert Andolina ) Subject : minnesota scene Nntp-Posting-Host : psci7.polisci.umn.edu Organization : Department of Political Science , University of Minnesota Lines : 39 To those who are wondering what is happening in Minnesota : From what I have seen in the local news ( TV and newspaper ) , various people in the area are trying to get a new hockey team . A columnist for the St. Paul `` Pioneer Press '' wrote an article giving the `` inside scoop '' on the issue . There are three local sites competing for a team and three possible candiates to move to the Twin Cities . First the sites : Target Center , Civic Center ( St. Paul ) , and yes , even the Met Center . The columnist was pretty confident that Minnesota will get a team , and that the Target Center will ultimately win out . He argued , however , that the competition from the other two sites will delay the process considerably . Without the inter-site competition , the columnist ( sorry , I ca n't remember his name ) believes that Minnesota would have a team by the 1994-95 season . Also , because of the situation with the Timberwolves , things will be delayed until ( unless ) the city of Minneapolis takes over the Target Center . However , they are unlikely to do so until the Met Center is destroyed , because the city will lose money if there is competition from the Met for conventions and short-term events ( even with hockey at Target ) . To add to this mess , a STUDY ( 6 to 12 months ) is going to be conducted on the future viability of the Met Center , which obviously delays the process even further . I hope that the study is cancelled , which will have the effect of knocking the Met Center out of the running and perhaps encouraging Minneapolis to take over the Target Center sooner . The city would be be even more encourged if the wrecking ball is taken to the Met , which may happen . Regarding possible candidates , the three teams are Hartford , Tampa Bay , and New Jersey . I would prefer the Devils ( Minnesota `` Ice Demons ? '' ) although the Lightning may have potential . Although it has n't been announced yet , it looks like 6 neutral site games will be played at the Target Center next year . Apparently the Devils are interested in playing in as many of those six games as possible , and I would n't be surprised to see Hartford and Tampa show up there either . So , Minnesota may end up getting another team , but it may take a few years . Go Sabres ! Robert Andolina ( former Buffalonian living in Minneapolis ) randolin @ polisci.umn.edu

Any other The Leafs have always been kind of comical . During the second Imlach era , when Darryl Sittler was called a `` cancer on the team '' , he tore the C off his sweater and for a while the Leafs did n't have a Captain . Sittler eventually ended up in Philly and he was promised the Philly captaincy by new GM ( and Sittler 's friend ) Bobby Clarke . Instead , Sittler got traded to Detroit . Rick Vaive was the Leaf Captain for awhile but he slept in one day and they took the captaincy away from him . Then he was traded to Chicago . During Doug Carpenter 's tenure as Leaf coach , in an attempt to kiss the ass of a sulking Gary Leeman , the Leafs took the A away from Brad Marsh to give to Leeman . Leeman would n't take it and when they tried to give it back to Marsh , he would n't take it neither . The best story I remember about a captain concerned Mel Bridgman , late of the Senators . While he was in Philadelphia , Bobby Clarke , arguably one of the great captains of all time , was bumped up to the status of playing coach and so he had to relinquish the captaincy . Bridgman be- came the new captain . A reporter asked a Flyer what Bridgman did as a captain since Clarke was still the undisputed leader amongst the players . The reporter was told that Bridgman was in charge of making sure that the soap dispensers in the showers were always full . -- cordially , as always , maynard @ ramsey.cs.laurentian.ca `` So many morons ... rm ... and so little time .

The real issue is whether the levels of methanol and formaldehyde > produced are high enough to cause significant damage , as both are toxic to > living cells . All I can say is that I will not consume it . Aspartame is the methyl ester of a dipeptide , so a product of its hydrolysis is going to be methanol , which can then be oxidized to formaldehyde . The amounts of methanol formed from the ingestion of aspartame-containing foods are completely in the metabolic noise , since you 're forming equally minute amounts of methanol from other components of food all the time . In studies involving administration of high doses of the additive , blood methanol levels were undetectable . Methanol is a poison only in quantities seen in human poisonings , say 5ml and above . This is a consequence of its oxidation to formaldehyde and formic acid , two quite reactive compounds which at high enough levels can damage tissues like the retina and kidney , because at such high doses the body 's detoxification system is overwhelmed . Interestingly , one treatment for early methanol poisoning is to get the person drunk on ethyl alcohol -- vodka or an equivalent . That 's because ethanol is metabolized preferentially over methanol by the enzymes in the liver . If the methanol stays as methanol and is n't metabolized to formaldehyde , it is actually relatively non-toxic . -- Steve Dyer dyer @ ursa-major.spdcc.com aka { ima , harvard , rayssd , linus , m2c } ! spdcc ! dyer

Smartdrive caches things , and Windows also runs a swap file which may contain data also . All of this is pretty risky stuff in a PC environment . > The straightforward approach would be to run chkdsk with the /f option to > fix the disk and then it looks like I would probably have to reinstall Windows > and a few other things . A reasonably accurate prediction ... Here 's a brief description of how DOS stores files : There are three pieces to a file . The directory entry , the FAT chain , and the data area . You can think of these as a sheet of lined notebook paper , a sheet of graph paper , and a stack of 3X5 cards . The directory entry ( notebook paper ) holds the file name , actual size , and first cluster number . It also holds some other information that 's not important right now . The File Allocation Table ( FAT ) chain ( graph paper ) tells where to find the actual data . Each square of graph paper holds a number . If the number is zero , the cluster associated with this box is available . If it holds a `` magic '' number , it is either the last piece of a file or a bad ( unuseable ) spot on the disk . Any other number tells which cluster contains the next section of the file . The data area ( 3X5 cards ) is where the actual information is stored . The data area is organized as clusters of a fixed size ; storage is doled out in `` chunks '' of one cluster each . ( In your case , one cluster is 2048 bytes . ) As a cluster is filled , another is allocated . To read a file , you first look at the directory entry to get the starting cluster number . Now you read the data from that cluster . Next , look at the FAT entry for the cluster you just read . This will tell you the cluster number for the next chunk of the file . Naturally , these numbers are usually sequential , but they can jump around and even go backwards . Continue reading , one cluster at a time , as you walk this chain through the FAT , until you hit the marker which says it 's the last cluster in the file . CHKDSK is the DOS utility that checks the sanity and coherence of the directories and the FAT and can bludgeon most flaws into submission . It does n't have any intelligence , so you have to double-check anything it `` fixes '' . Now let 's do a bit of a post-mortem : > C : \GFX\VPIC46\CVPIC.EXE > C : \GFX\VPIC46\VPIC.TXT > C : \GFX\VPIC46\VIDEO7.CFG > C : \GFX\VPIC46\ORCPRO2.CFG > C : \GFX\VPIC46\VGA.CFG > C : \GAME\GOOSE\BIRD2.X > C : \WINMISC\ADV21\WINADV.EXE > Allocation error , size adjusted All of these files have sizes ( according to the FAT ) which do n't match the size reported in their directory entries . CHKDSK /F will alter the directory entries to match the FAT size . ( In other words , the directory entry for CVPIC.EXE may say the file is 64,877 bytes long . But CHKDSK found a FAT chain of 43 clusters attached to it . ( My numbers , obviously , are made up . ) ) > 316 lost allocation units found in 224 chains . > 647168 bytes disk space would be freed Disk space was found which is allocated in the FAT , but is not attached to any directory entry . CHKDSK /F gives you the option of converting these '' lost chains '' to files . You can then examine the files ( FILE0000.CHK through FILE0223.CHK ) and rename or discard them . Or , if you tell CHKDSK _not_ to convert them to files , then those clusters will simply be marked `` available '' in the FAT . > C : \GFX\VPIC46\CVPIC.EXE > Is cross linked on allocation unit 16133 ... > C : \386SPART.PAR > Is cross linked on allocation unit 16133 These files are both referencing the _same_ data cluster . Obviously , one of them ( at least ) must be wrong . It 's interesting to note that C : \386SPART.PAR is your Windows swap file ... To fix this , you should copy each cross-linked file to a new name . This will `` fix '' the cross-link by giving the files unique data spaces . Now delete the cross-linked files . Examine the copies and try to assemble them properly . Good luck . ( Hint : `` Missing pieces '' are likely to be found in those `` lost chains '' at the top ... ) > 42366976 bytes total disk space > 3958784 bytes in 4 hidden files > 153600 bytes in 67 directories > 36042752 bytes in 1496 user files > 1564672 bytes available on disk Your disk is pretty close to full . This may be the actual cause of the problem ; perhaps Windows needed to expand its swapfile by an amount which exceeded available disk space ... In any case , the short summary is that something trashed your FAT . There are utilities that can mirror your FAT and help repair damage after something like this , but you have to run them _before_ the problem occurs .

Depending on his answer , this could be an appalling development calling into question both DES and RSA/DES . not really . in fact , public key based communication systems very often pick keys automatically which are much better than passwords or pass phrases . If any bright programmer with a little idle machine time can crack a single DES message in a couple of days ( assuming no tricks that are message-specific ) , if a person picked the password or pass phrase , then the key search is pretty straightforward . in running english text , the average content of a single word is about 8 bits . in pass phrases , this may increase to 10 bits or so . searching 30bit spaces is semi-practical even in software and searching 40bit spaces is n't outrageous to imagine with hardware assists of moderate size .

I really like these claims . Where did they come from ? We hear , practically daily , that the NSA monitors , oh , everything . They can crack anything . They 'd never release a cryptosystem they could n't crack . Where do people get these fascinating facts ? 'The Puzzle Palace ' ? If you can get it for a buck , 2nd hand , it must be true , eh ?

I do n't recall reading anywhere reliable that they 're supposed to : 1 ) Monitor my phonecalls . 2 ) Monitor usenet . 3 ) Provide only cryptosystems they can easily crack . 4 ) etc etc . This is not to say that they *don't* , they might . But you don't know that they do , and you have no evidence that they do , for almost all values of you .

Living through those days at the age of 20 and following the internal and external news gives me that knowledge and position . In 1974 , Turkey had a democratic goverment and free press at that time .

I thought that MIA 's are only the subject of Rambo and Chuck Noris movies . Seems that I am wrong . > > As for their treatment being according to what convention ... ? > Okay we believe you . You do n't need to belive me . Turkiye was never a clandestine state in its history , It has been a respected and continuous member of UN since the inception of UN . No body ever questioned the UN membership of Turkey because of what had happened in 1974a and after . Only a short lived arms embargo was imposed unilaterally by USA to satisfy the internal Greek loby . I know what you would say next . Let me answer it before wasting anytime . Yes ! UN had a few condemning resolutions against Turkey because of handling the Cyprus problem , especially after the 1980 coup . Well , US and Israel had a few too . What can I say ?

I heard many times from Denktas interviews by Turkish and International press . He keeps saying that `` This was no longer an issue for peace talks .

I just told you what was given to Greek Cypriots as an answer by Turkish Goverment/Turkish Cypriots when they wanted to locate some of their own between July 15 and the final cease-fire in late August , 1974 . This answer seems to satisfy the international community , the UN , and the Vasilu Goverment ( since he did not make it an issue for the peace talks ) . Also , I am not aware of any UN condemnation against Turkey about any missing Greek-Cypriot . Are you ?

Are any of the inputs to the chip coming from TTL ? Standby-drain specs for CMOS chips typically apply only if inputs are pulled all the way down to zero or all the way up to Vcc .

Your using 20th century concepts to interprete 1st century writers . Of course , in your termonology , God could not `` cease to exist . '' However , that is not what death ever means in the Scriptures . If you will study the word , you will see that it signifies `` separation . '' Death is separation , not ceastation . This is the reason for the agony of the cross . For the first time in eternity , one member of the Godhead was separated from the other two . I once met a young lady that was as beautiful as any model that ever lived . She was as personable as any saint ever imagined . She was to become my '' girlfriend '' for several years . However , having been drafted , we were separated by distance . To me that was a form of death . Later , she decided that she could n't wait for me to come home and bid me adue . That to me was death . It was separation from that which had made me whole . Death is separation and eternal death is eternal separation from His fellowship , not because He chose to send you into outer darkness , but because you chose to go there . > > did you know that Jesus talked more > > about hell than He did about heaven ! > Thank you for this info . What respect I had for the man now > has been diminished tenfold . I promise never again to > say how wise or loving this man was ... When I rebelled against my earthly father , he spanked me . I found no wisdom in that until I had grown older and especially until I had my own children . He was trying to guide me away from hurt that would enter my life if I continued on my suicidal course . He did it in love though I interpreted it as harsh and unloving . If God warns of impending danger , that is love . If choose to let us do as we please , and then at the end tell us the rules , that would be harsh . You have a conscience , no matter how calused or fallen it is , that witnesses to you that a thing is wrong and that there is cause for fear . > Being Jesus was allegedly God , I doubt he could honestly feel > the pinpricks man dealt him ... This may give light to the error of your understanding . One must have correct knowledge in order to have correct faith . Faith and knowledge are inseparable . Jesus most certainly felt the `` pinpricks '' of life . As the Scripture say : Heb . 4:15 For we do not have a high priest who can not sympathize with our weaknesses , but One who has been tempted in all things as we are , yet without sin . The kenosis passage of Phil 2 states that He gave up His Godhead attributes when He took upon Himself humanity . It has been a favorite meditation of mine to think about this . It was to be my PhD thesis . `` The Consciousness of Christ . '' I have talked at length with a great many people about this interesting study , including clh . It is my conclussion that as Jesus , the 2nd member of the Trinity , actually suffered as we do . He became part of the human race and experienced it as we do . He `` grew in knowledge . '' He chose not to grasp His omniscience , but chose to be taught . It is my understanding that He was `` led of the Spirit '' to such an extent that sometimes it is hard to distinquish between Jesus the man and Jesus as God . But in Jn 8 where the adulterous women was thrown before Him , the tenses are quite clear in that the whole situation took Him by surprise . That is , He was not aware that this event was to take place in time . He was living sequential history as you or I . Maybe some other time we can discuss this , but it is a very lengthy discussion and one that causes the curcuit breakers of the brain to pop more often than not . > Thanks again for the info . Just so you know , some friends and I > are starting a Freethinkers organization -- and I 'm going to > use some of the info you provided for an organization intro- > duction ... : - ) I was once a member of that club . THe `` free thinker '' is a glorious ideal . By contrast , of course , you believe that the believer is the unforunate repository of everything that is dogmatic , inhibited , reactionary and repressive . I find such a stance to be as amusing as it is absurd . If the liberal humanist wishes to criticize a Christian or a Buddhist or a Marxist , that is his right . But what he must not pretend is that he was led to this solely by his `` rational doubt '' when in fact he was led to it by his `` faith '' . He must acknowledge that while it is rational doubt for him as a `` free thinker '' to criticize the Christian , it might equally be a rational doubt for the Christian to criticize him as a humanist . If there is no faith , there can be no dout . There is no faith which can not choose to cast doubt on some other faith . Pascal pointed out that `` sceptical arguments allow the positive to be positive . Few . . .speak dubiously of scepticism . '' The fact that skeptics are not skeptical about skepticism is further evidence that to doubt anything we must believe in something else ! THe person who is skeptical toward one faith or even most faiths , will be the devoted adherent of another . In fact , it is a measure of his poverty both that he is unaware of it and that he can define himself only in negative terms , hence the term `` a '' -theist . Some people claim otherwise and argue vociferously for complete skepticism . In my campus ministry I ran across this more times than I care to remember . However , they disproved their own argument with every thought , every word , every point of logic that they used . Every moment of shared communication speaks against their total skepticism . Their very insistence of trying to make sense is eloquent testimony to assumptions that are powerful though silent . That is to say , that complete skepticism is impossible and limited skepticism is arbitrary . Next time you 're in a room of skeptics , yell out `` Look , your fly is undone ! '' Each person chooses what he is skeptical about and what he believes without skepticism . To stress this is to belabor the obvious , but it underlines the point that no one can know exhaustively how he knows what he knows . Pure objectivism is a myth and complete skepticism an impossiblity . The answer to this impasse lies in a 3rd way of knowing , one which is based on presuppositions . But if knowledge proceeds on what must be presupposed before it is proved , the cover is blown on the pretentions of critical doubt , and critical doubt depends on the idea that human knowledge is totally objective and neutral . In other words , another myth . Presuppositions my friend . It is impossible to doubt anything unless there is something we do not doubt -our own assumptions/presuppostions . Even these can be criticezed only upon the basis of other assumptions . Presuppostitons are our silent partners in thought but their silence must not be mistaken for absence . > I tell you what -- if God condemns me for being honest , He is > unworthy of my worship . Better to burn in Hell than to > serve a tyrant in Heaven.. Of course that is hardly an original statement . Milton coined it but it had been in use for millenia . It was even used in the first `` Highlander '' movie . But again , your presuption is based on a faulty knowledge of the character of God . You are operating off of a presuppositional premise of humanistic theology , not what He has revealed of Himself through history , through His prophets , through His Word , and lastly , but most of all , thru His Son . If you are to reject God 's annointed savior , then reject Him from a correct understanding of Himself . -- Rex

When asking for help on the net or X mailing lists , be sure to include all information about your setup and what you are doing . The more specific you are , the more likely someone will spot an error in what you are doing . Without all the details , people who want to help you often have to guess -- if they are able to respond at all . Always mention what version of X you are using and where you got it from . If your server came from a different source as the rest of your X system , give details of that , too . Give the machine type , operating system , and O/S version for both the client and server machine . It may also be appropriate to mention the window manager , compiler , and display hardware type you are using . Then tell exactly what you are doing , exactly what happens , and what you expected/wanted to happen . If it is a command that fails , include the exact transcript of your session in the message . If a program you wrote does n't work the way you expect , include as little of the source necessary ( just a small test case , please ! ) for readers to reproduce the problem . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Subject : 8 ) What publications discussing X are available ?

( How do I write X-friendly applications ? ) The Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual is one of the official X Consortium standards documents that define the X environment . It describes the conventions that clients must observe to coexist peacefully with other clients sharing the same server . If you are writing X clients , you need to read and understand the ICCCM , in particular the sections discussing the selection mechanism and the interaction between your client and the window manager . Get it either : - as part of the R4 distribution from MIT - in the later editions of the Scheifler/Gettys `` X Window System '' book - as an appendix in the new version of O'Reilly 's Volume 0 , `` X Protocol Reference Manual . '' A version in old copies of their Volume 1 is obsolete . The version in the Digital Press book is much more readable , thanks to the efforts of Digital Press 's editors to improve the English and the presentation . [ from David Rosenthal , 10/90 ] - the ICCCM was updated for R5 ; updates are published in O'Reilly's '' Programmer 's Supplement for Release 5 '' . The complete document is on the R5 tapes .

The MIT X Consortium was formed in January of 1988 to further the development of the X Window System and has as its major goal the promotion of cooperation within the computer industry in the creation of standard software interfaces at all layers in the X Window System environment . MIT 's role is to provide the vendor-neutral architectural and administrative leadership required to make this work . Membership in the Consortium open to any organization . There are two categories of membership , Member ( for large organizations ) and Affiliate ( for smaller organizations ) . Most of the Consortium 's activities take place via electronic mail , with meetings when required . As designs and specifications take shape , interest groups are formed from experts in the participating organizations . Typically a small multi-organization architecture team leads the design , with others acting as close observers and reviewers . Once a complete specification is produced , it may be submitted for formal technical review by the Consortium as a proposed standard . The standards process typically includes public review ( outside the Consortium ) and a demonstration of proof of concept . Your involvement in the public review process or as a Member or Affiliate of the Consortium is welcomed .

OPEN LOOK and Motif are two graphical user interfaces ( GUIs ) . OPEN LOOK was developed by Sun with help from AT & T and many industry reviewers ; Motif was developed by the Open Software Foundation ( OSF ) with input from many OSF members . OPEN LOOK is primarily a user-interface specification and style-guide ; there are several toolkits which can be used to produce OPEN LOOK applications . Motif includes an API specification ; the only sanctioned Motif toolkit is the one from OSF . However , there are other toolkits which can be used to produce programs which look and behave like OSF/Motif ; one of these , ParcPlace 's ( formerly Solbourne 's ) OI , is a `` virtual toolkit '' which provides objects in the style of OPEN LOOK and Motif , at the user 's choice . OPEN LOOK GUI is also the name of a product from AT & T , comprising their OPEN LOOK Intrinsics Toolkit and a variety of applications .

PEX is the `` PHiGS Extension to X '' . PHiGS stands for `` Programmer 's Hierarchical Interactive Graphics System '' and is essentially a library of functions that simplifies the creation and manipulation of 3D graphics . Many platforms are capable of performing in hardware the computations involved in rendering 3D objects ; the extension allows the client ( PHiGS in this case ) to take advantage of the specialized hardware for 3D graphics . Sun Microsystems is currently contracted to develop a freely redistributable ( copyright similar to the current X copyright ) sample implementation . Source and documentation are available in the R5 release . Several vendors are currently selling independently-developed PEX servers for their workstations and X terminals . [ last modified 10/91 ] -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Subject : 16 ) What is `` low-bandwidth X '' ( LBX ) ? XRemote ? PPP ? SLIP ? CSLIP ? There are several options for using X over serial lines : SLIP - Serial Line IP ; this is both a mechanism and a protocol for sending IP packets over point-to-point serial links . It has been around for several years , and implementations are available for many of the major TCP/IP implementations . Most X Terminal vendors supply this as a checkoff item , although nobody really ever uses it since it is horribly slow . The TCP/IP headers add 40 bytes per packet and the TCP/IP encoding of the X protocol is rather verbose ( rightfully so ; it is optimized for packing and unpacking over high-speed links ) . CSLIP - Compressed header SLIP ; this is a variant of SLIP that compresses the 40 bytes of TCP/IP headers down to about 5 or 6 bytes . It still does n't do anything about reencoding the X protocol . Modems that do compression can help , but they increase packet latency ( it takes time to dribble the uncompressed data through typical serial interfaces , plus the compression assembly time ) . PPP - Point-to-Point Protocol ; this is an emerging standard for point-to-point links over serial lines that has a more complete set of option negotiation than SLIP . A growing number of people see the combination of PPP for the serial line management and CSLIP for the header compression as becoming common for running normal TCP/IP protocols over serial lines . Running raw X over the wire still needs compression somewhere to make it usable . XRemote - this is the name of both a protocol and set of products originally developed by NCD for squeezing the X protocol over serial lines . In addition to using a low level transport mechanism similar to PPP/CSLIP , XRemote removes redundancies in the X protocol by sending deltas against previous packets and using LZW to compress the entire data stream . This work is done by either a pseudo-X server or `` proxy '' running on the host or in a terminal server . There are several advantages to doing compression outside the modem : ( 1 ) You do n't *have* to have compressing modems in there if you would n't otherwise be using them ( e.g . if you were going to be directly connected ) , and ( 2 ) It reduces the I/O overhead by cutting down on the number of bytes that have to cross the serial interface , and ( 3 ) In addition to the effects of # 2 , it reduces the latency in delivering packets by not requiring the modem to buffer up the data waiting for blocks to compress . LBX - Low Bandwidth X ; this is an X Consortium project that is working on a standard for this area . It is being chaired by NCD and Xerox and is using NCD 's XRemote protocol as a stepping stone in developing the new protocol . LBX will go beyond XRemote by adding proxy caching of commonly-used information ( e.g . connection setup data , large window properties , font metrics , keymaps , etc . ) and a more efficient encoding of the X protocol . The hope is to have a Standard ready for public review in the first half of next year and a sample implementation available in R6 .

What are all these different window managers ? The window manager in X is just another client -- it is not part of the X window system , although it enjoys special privileges -- and so there is no single window manager ; instead , there are many which support different ways for the user to interact with windows and different styles of window layout , decoration , and keyboard and colormap focus . In approximate chronological order ( generally , the more recent ones are more conformant with the ICCCM ) : wm : this simple title-bar window manager was phased out in R2 or R3 uwm : the Universal Window Manager is still popular for its speed , although it is very outdated . Moved to contrib/ on the R4 tape . twm ( old ) : Tom 's Window Manager was among the first non-MIT window managers and offered the user a great deal of customization options in a re-parenting window manager . awm : the Ardent Window Manager remains a hotbed for hackers and offers some features ( dynamic menus ) not found on more current window managers cwm : cwm is part of the Andrew system . rtl : Siemen 's window manager tiles windows so that they do n't overlap and resizes the window with the focus to its preferred size . dxwm : Digital 's dxwm is part of the DECwindows offering hpwm : HP 's window manager offers a 3D look ; it is a precursor of mwm mwm : the Motif window manager is part of the OSF/Motif toolkit tekwm : Tektronix 's window manager offering olwm ( Sun ) : olwm implements the OPEN LOOK GUI and some of the Style Guide functionality olwm ( AT & T ) : ditto gwm : Bull 's Generic Window Manager emulates others with a built-in Lisp interpreter .

It need n't . What is probably happening is that you are running your window manager as the last job in your .xsession or .xinitrc file ; your X session runs only as long as the last job is running , and so killing your window manager is equivalent to logging out . Instead , run the window manager in the background , and as the last job instead invoke something safe like : exec xterm -name Login -rv -iconic or any special client of your devising which exits on some user action . Your X session will continue until you explicitly logout of this window , whether or not you kill or restart your window manager . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Subject : 20 ) Can I save the state of my X session , like toolplaces does ? Although no known window manager directly supports such a feature -- which may be equivalent to writing out a .xinitrc or .xsession file naming the geometry and WM_COMMAND of each application ( but olvwm may have something close ) -- there is a contributed application which does much of what you are looking for , although it is not as complete as the SunView program toolplaces . Look for the application `` xplaces '' on an archive-server near you . There are several versions of this program floating around ; look for a recent vintage . [ 10/90 ] Some new pseudo session-managers such as HP 's vuewm provide for the saving of sessions including information on the geometry of currently-running applications and the resource database .

You can turn auto-repeat on or off by using `` xset r on|off '' . The X protocol , however , does n't provide for varying the auto-repeat rate , which is a capability not supported by all systems . Some servers running on systems that support this , however , may provide command-line flags to set the rate at start-up time . If you have control over server start-up ( see the man pages for xinit and xdm ) , you can invoke the server with the chosen settings ; for example , you can start the Xsun server from MIT with the options `` -ar1 350 -ar2 30 '' to reduce the sensitivity of the keyboard . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Subject : 23 ) How do I remap the keys on my keyboard to produce a string ? There is no method of arranging for a particular string to be produced when you press a particular key . The xmodmap client , which is useful for moving your CTRL and ESC keys to useful places , just rearranges keys and does not do `` macro expansion . '' Some ( few ) clients , including xterm and several X-based editors , accept a translation resource such as : xterm*VT100.Translations : # override \ < Key > F1 : string ( `` setenv DISPLAY unix:0 '' ) which permits the shorthand F1 to be pressed to reset the display locally within an xterm ; it takes effect for new xterm clients . To include control characters in the string , use \nnn , where nnn is the octal encoding of the control character you want to include . Window managers , which could provide this facility , do not yet ; nor has a special `` remapper '' client been made available . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- David B.

I used gcc to compile the whole distribution , but I get several segmentation faults when running X . Note first that gcc on RISC machines does not necessarily result in any performance increase ; it certainly is not as noticeable as it is on the 680x0 or VAX platforms . Here is the problem : gcc and cc use incompatible methods of passing structures as arguments and returning them as function values , so when gcc-compiled parts of X are linked with Sun-supplied functions that pass or return structs , run-time errors occur . Affected programs include rgb and the server . This is from the GCC manual : On the Sparc , GNU CC uses an incompatible calling convention for structures . It passes them by including their contents in the argument list , whereas the standard compiler passes them effectively by reference . This really ought to be fixed , but such calling conventions are not yet supported in GNU CC , so it is n't straightforward to fix it . The convention for structure returning is also incompatible , and ` -fpcc-struct-return ' does not help . You can duck the problem either by using cc throughout or by using it for just the routines which cause incompatibilities ; the problem can not be solved with compilation flags . Files which need to be compiled using cc include : server/os/4.2bsd/oscolor.c rgb/rgb.c In addition , several of the `` inet_ '' functions use structs as args or return values : clients/xhost/xhost.c clients/xauth/gethost.c . Calls to inet_addr in /lib/CLX/socket.c and lib/X/XConnDis.c are possibly harmless as they do n't involve structs .

'' Running the gcc fixincludes script apparently did n't work . You can do this simple test : # include < sys/ioctl.h > SIOCGIFCONF Run that through cc -E and gcc -E. The last line of output is the piece of interest ; it should be identical ( modulo irrelevant differences like whitespace ) . If the gcc version has ' x ' where the cc version has ' i ' , your fixincludes run did n't work for some reason or other ; go back to your gcc sources and run ` fixincludes ` ; then rebuild the X distribution . If they are identical , try running a make clean in mit/server and rebuilding , just to make sure everything gets compiled with the proper include files .

While building and installing the distribution , you need to be careful to avoid linking against any existing X shared libraries you might have ( e.g . those distributed with OpenWindows ) . You should make sure you do not have LD_LIBRARY_PATH set in your environment during the build or the installation . If you are going to keep xterm and xload as setuid programs , please note that the shared libraries must be installed in /usr/lib , /usr/local/lib , or /usr/5lib for these programs to work ( or else those programs must be linked statically ) . [ courtesy MIT X Consortium ] Note also that the program mkfontdir is run as part of the build ; it attempts , however , to use the shared libraries before they have been installed .

It was n't documented and was removed in X11R5 ( MIT 's guarantee of upward compatibility between the R4 and R5 libraries only applied to the documented interface ) .

There is a security problem with certain R4 clients ( xterm and xload ) running under SunOS 4.1 that have been installed setuid root and are using shared libraries ; to avoid the problem , do one of these : 1 ) make the program non-setuid . You should consult your system administrator concerning protection of resources ( e.g . ptys and /dev/kmem ) used by these programs , to make sure that you do not create additional security problems at your site . 2 ) relink the programs statically ( using -Bstatic ) . 3 ) install the libraries before linking and link with absolute paths to the libraries . [ from rws @ expo.lcs.mit.edu ( Bob Scheifler ) , 12/90 ] The R5 version of xterm does this automatically by rebuilding xterm against the newly-installed libraries when xterm is being installed ; this prevents an suid program from being built with libraries specified relatively . Note that this may cause an inconvenience when doing the installation from NFS-mounted disks . Xload has been rewritten to avoid the problem . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Subject : 104 ) How do I get around the frame-buffer security hole ?

Imake is not a replacement for the make program ; instead , it is a makefile-generator that takes advantages of the include-file and macro- processing capabilities of the C preprocessor cpp to generate makefiles suitable for building software on a particular system . Although it is not specific to X , the X release uses it to help solve a number of the configuration issues that arise in making such a large system widely portable . Imake has a fairly steep learning curve , in part because the process by which the system-specific configuration files , system-independent configuration files , and individual Imakefiles are melded to produce a Makefile is not obvious . There have been several different versions of imake ; the R3 , R4 , and R5 versions are different . You can obtain information on imake from these sources : - the R4 and R5 release notes and imake man page include information on using Imake to build X - the R4 and R5 file mit/config/README also contains useful information - on the R4 tapes , contrib/doc/imake/imake.tex is Mark Moraes ' R3/R4 guide to imake . - the R5 mit/doc/config/usenixws/paper.ms contains a paper by Jim Fulton on an early version of Imake - Paul Dubois ( dubois @ primate.wisc.edu ) has written a useful explanation of how Imake works and how to use it in configuring X for non- supported systems ; the document is available from ftp.primate.wisc.edu in the directory ~ftp/pub/imake-stuff ; look for config-X11R4.ms ( troff ) and config-X11R4.ps ( PostScript ) .

Versions are distributed with the R4 and R5 releases . An earlier version is distributed with the X11R3 release ; some third-party toolkits redistribute versions of imake along with their own implementations of the template and configuration files . There are no real standards for such configuration files , although most *current* contributed software expects the templates distributed with X11R5 . export contains the R5 distribution unpacked , so you can pick up imake without picking up the entire distribution . A stand-alone version of Imake , but one stemming from X11R5 , is in ftp.germany.eu.net : pub/X11/misc/imake/imake-pure.tar.Z ( 192.76.144.75 ) . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Subject : 108 ) I have a program with an Imakefile but no Makefile .

When I try to compile certain programs , I get the following link error : Undefined : _XShapeQueryExtension _XShapeCombineMask These routines are actually part of the Shape Extension to X ( SHAPE ) which was introduced in the MIT X11R4 distribution and allows non-rectangular windows . Like the other sample server extensions , the shape extension will only run on a server which supports it . Pre-X11R4 servers , as well as many vendor-supplied servers , do not support the shape extension , in which case they will display rectangular windows anyway . In order to use the shape extension , you must link to the library libXext.a . In the X11R4 distribution , this library and the associated includes will be in the mit/extensions directory . If you do not have these files , do not despair : many freeware programs which use the shape extension can also be compiled without it by removing the -DSHAPE define from the Makefile ; you can probably do this and compile successfully against your older vendor-supplied X libraries .

When I run a X program that I wrote on a SunOS 4.0.3 or 4.1 machine I get the error `` ld.so : symbol not found _XtInherit '' . What you are seeing is a side-effect of a kludge in the R4 libXt.a to get Sun shared libraries working . Apparently , you ca n't share a function that is both called and compared , as _XtInherit is . This was handled by putting _XtInherit in the same file as a function that is always used , thereby guaranteeing that it would be loaded -- that is , in Initialize.c , where XtToolkitInitialize ( ) and XtInitialize ( ) reside . These routines would normally be called . You are probably seeing this error because your program is not a normal Xt-based program and does not call XtToolkitInitialize ( ) anywhere . 1 ) it may be a program that uses Xt functions but never opens a connection to the X server . [ OSF/Motif 's 1.1.0 UIL had this problem ; it called XtMalloc ( ) and other Xt functions . ] The solution is to add the call to your program ; the function does not have to be executed , just linked in . 2 ) alternatively , your program does n't need any Xt functions and is correct in not calling XtToolkitInitialize ( ) -- it may be an Xlib or XView program . In this case , you can remove -lXt from your link command . It should not be necessary to link the shared libraries statically , although this will certainly solve the problem .

The window manager controls how the input focus is transferred from one window to another . In order to get keystrokes , your program must ask the window manager for the input focus . To do this , you must set up what are called `` hints '' for the window manager . If your applications is Xlib-based , you can use something like the following : XWMHints wmhints ; ... wmhints.flags = InputHint ; wmhints.input = True ; XSetWMHints ( dpy , window , & wmhints ) If your application is based on the Xt Intrinsics , you can set the XtNinput resource to be True ( as you probably want to in any case ) ; if you do n't have source , you can start up the application with the resource '*input : True ' . Certain window managers , notably dxwm and olwm , are very picky about having this done . If you are using Sun 's OpenWindows olwm , you can also add this resource to your defaults file to use clients that are n't ICCCM-compliant .

You ca n't reliably tell ; whatever mechanism you could use could be spoofed in any case . For most cases , you should n't care which window manager is running , so long as you do things in an ICCCM-conformant manner . There are some cases in which particular window managers are known to do things wrong ; checking for particular hints placed on the window by the window manager so that you can sidestep the problem may be appropriate in these cases . Alternatively , it may be appropriate to determine which window manager is running in order to take advantage of specific *added* features ( such as olwm 's push-pin menus ) in order to give your program *added* functionality . Beware of usurping the window manager 's functions by providing that functionality even when it is missing ; this surely leads to future compatibility problems . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Subject : 115 ) Is there a skeleton X program available ? There is no general framework such as the TransSkel program for the Macintosh which handles lots of the odds and ends and overhead of development under a window system and which can be used as a platform for additional development . In X , the problem is typically solved by using an interactive application builder tool or by using cut & paste on existing X applications . Good applications which you might look to manipulate when you want to `` test just this one little thing '' include contrib/clients/xskel , a simple R4 program that puts up a window and allows sketching in it and offers a starting point for quick hacks , the Xaw examples in the examples/ directory in the R3 and R4 distributions , and the Xlib `` Hello World '' example in the R3 doc/HelloWorld and R4 doc/tutorials/HelloWorld ; an updated version of this program which uses R4 Xlib calls and current ICCCM conventions was posted in 2/90 to comp.windows.x by Glenn Widener of Tektronix .

The XtGetValues interface for retrieving resources from a widget is sensitive to the type of variable . Your code may be doing something like this : { Arg args [ 3 ] ; int i ; int sensitive ; /* oops ; wrong data type */ i=0 ; XtSetArg ( args [ i ] , XtNsensitive , & sensitive ) ; i++ ; XtGetValues ( widget , args , i ) ; ... } But XtNsensitive is a Boolean , which on most machines is a single byte ; declaring the variable `` sensitive '' as Boolean works properly . This problem comes up often when using particular toolkits that redefine the Xt types Dimension and Position ; code that assumes they are int will have similar problems if those types are actually short . In general : you are safe if you use the actual type of the resource , as it appears in the widget 's man page .

You 're probably trying to use these functions from application code . They should be used only internally to widgets ; these functions are for a parent widget to change the geometry of its children . Other promising functions , XtMakeGeometryRequest ( ) and XtMakeResizeRequest ( ) , are also for use only by widgets , in this case by a child to request a change from its parent . The only way for your application to request a geometry change for a widget is to issue an XtSetValues call setting some of the geometry resources . Although this will result in the widget-internal functions ' being called , your application code must use the standard XtSetValues interface or risk the widgets ' data becoming corrupted . [ The Xlib calls XMoveWindow ( ) and XResizeWindow ( ) should similarly be avoided ; they should n't be used to change XtNx , XtNy , XtNwidth , or XtNheight . ] -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Subject : 118 ) Why is n't there an XtReparentWidget call like XReparentWindow ? Although there are various details of the current implementation of the Xt internals which make reparenting difficult , the major reason that no such call exists is that it remains undefined what the set of resources for the `` new '' widget should be . Resources are typically set based on the location in the instance hierarchy ; what resources should change if the instance moves ? What should happen to the widget 's children ? And by the time such semantics are defined , there would probably be little advantage over destroying the old widget and creating a new widget in the correct location with the desired resources , as setting the resources correctly is the majority of work in creating a new widget .

From your post , you apparently find the idea that something is wrong with African Americans , value-wise , culture wise or something , very appealing . I never cease to be amazed at how eager non african americans are to embrace theories about our problems which basically assert that something is wrong with us . The socio-economic factors which we know help to produce high crime levels , like poverty , which exists among us in large proportion , I mean when it comes to discussion of african american problems , we somehow become exempt from all these types of factors , and the problem is laid at the doorstep of some neboulous dysfunction we supposedly have . But nobody attributes crime amongst white americans to dysfunction . No , that has socioeconomic factors to it , but for africa americans , its got ta be a dysfunction . Basically , I think this tendency for non african americans to believe that something is wrong with us exists because non african americans do n't want to deal with the possiblility that the society is deeply biased against african americans , and that this is about 80 % of the problem . It could not possible be that the society is so deeply racist and structured against us , that this has a very effective negative effect on us . No , something is wrong with us . Non african americans are quick to disregard what we have to say , because they are so busy trying to find something wrong with us , instead of taking a good hard look at the thing we say are doing us damage .

Flights of fancy , and other irrational approaches , are common . The crucial thing is not to sit around just having fantasies ; they are n't of any use unless they make you do some experiments . I 've known a lot of scientists whose fantasies lead them on to creative work ; usually they wo n't admit out loud what the fantasy was , prior to the consumption of a few beers . ( Simple example : Warren Jelinek noticed an extremely heavy band on a DNA electrophoresis gel of human ALU fragments . He got very excited , hoping that he 'd seen some essential part of the control mechanism for eukaryotic genes . This fantasy led him to sequence samples of the band and carry out binding assays . The result was a well-conserved , 400 or so bp , sequence that occurs about 500,000 times in the human genome . Unfortunately for Warren 's fantasy , it turns out to be a transposon that is present in so many copies because it replicates itself and copies itself back into the genome . On the other hand , the characteristics of transposons were much elucidated ; the necessity of a cellular reverse transcriptase was recognized ; and the standard method of recognizing human DNA was created . Other species have different sets of transposons . Fortunately for me , Warren and I used to eat dinner at T.G.I . Fridays all the time . ) > It further at least implicitly advances the position that > sciences goes `` forward '' ( and it is not clear what this means given the > context in which it occurs ) by generating in a completely non-rational > and even random way a plethora of hypotheses and theories that are then > weeded out via the `` critical function '' of science . I 'm not sure that it 's random . But there is no known rational mechanism for generating a rich set of interesting hypotheses . If you are really working in an unknown area , it is unlikely that you will have much sense of what might or might not be true ; under those circumstances , the best thing to do is just follow whatever instincts you have . If they are wrong , you will find out soon enough ; but at least , you will find out _something_ . If you try to do experiments at random , with no prior conceptions at all in mind , you will probably get nowhere . > ( Though why this critical > function should be less subject to the non-rational forces is a mystery . Unfortunately , the critical function does sometimes become hostage to non-rational forces . Then we get varieties of pathological science : Lysenko , Mirsky 's opposition to DNA-as-gene , cold fusion , and so forth . > If experimental design , hypotheses creation , and theory construction are > subject to jealousies and petty hatreds , then this must be equally true > of the application of any `` critical function '' concerning replication . > This is what leads one ( ala Feyerabend ) to an `` anything goes '' view . ) I do n't agree that this follows . In fact , this is _exactly_ the point at which I disagree with Feyerabend . It is a most important part of the culture of science that one keeps one 's jealousies out of the refereeing process . Failures there are aplenty , but , on the whole , things work out . Another point : there are a couple of senses of the phrase `` experimental design '' . I 'd say that the less rational part is in experimental _choice_ , not design . Alexander Fleming ( Proc . Royal Soc. , 1922 ) chose to look for bacteriophage in his own mucus for strange reasons ( Phage had previously been found in locust diarrhea ; Fleming probably thought runny bottom , runny nose , what the hell , it 's worth a try . ) but his method of looking for phage was well-designed to detect anything phage-like ; in fact , he found lysozyme . > True , the generation part *can* be totally irrational . But typically it is > *not* . Anecdotes concerning instances where a hypothesis seems to have > resulted in some way from a dream or from one 's political views simply > do not generalize well to the actual history of science . It is not clear to me what you mean by rational vs. irrational . Perhaps you can give a few examples of surprising experiments that were tried out for perfectly rational reasons , or interesting new theories that were first advanced from logical grounds . The main examples I can think of are from modern high-energy physics which is not typical of science as a whole . -- Mark A.

From : dallas @ ravel.udel.edu ( Paul Lewis Fincke ) Subject : SCSI help Nntp-Posting-Host : ravel.udel.edu Organization : University of Delaware Distribution : us Lines : 24 Howdy , Sorry if this has been covered before : One of my PC illiterate friends asked me to help him install DRDOS 6.0 on his NEC Powermate SX ( 386SX 16 ) . Of course , I said `` No problem '' and went to work . Unfortunately , the DRDOS refuses to recognize the hard drive during installation , even though I am still able to boot off of the hard drive using the old DOS . After openning it up I discovered it was using an 8-bit Seagate SCSI controller on a ST-157N SCSI 40Mbtye drive . I then booted with DRDOS 6.0 off of the floppy a second time and ran fdisk to see if I could access the drive . Lo and behold the primary 46.5 Mbyte partition was intact ( created by DOS 3.1 no less , I did n't think you could go over a 32Mbyte partition in the older DOSes . I could be wrong ... ) . I then tried to remove the primary partition , which it would n't allow me to do . I am unaware of anything special that has to be done with a SCSI drive ( I kinda expected it to work just like an IDE/MFM/RLL drive for DOS installations ) . Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated ( except for '' Throw it in the garbage and buy a new PC '' ) ... Thanks in advance , Paul `` Mr. SCSI ... NOT ! '' Fincke

I dont believe the gay comunity is asking for hiring quotas like the affirmative action laws of the 60 's did . My understanding is that the gay community just wants the same rights the srtraights have . I dont think people should have their leases cancelled when their landlord finds out they are gay . I dont think that when someone sees someone walk out of a gay business and then blabs it all over work that the gay person gets fired . Do you REALLY think these are justified ? # 4 Clayton , I am told you are a parent a couple times over . Have you been following the strip in the paper `` For Better or For Worse '' ?

How much do you care about other people 's childeren ? Do you care about MY childeren ? Do you care about my sister 's childeren ? If one of your kids told you he/she was gay , would you throw them out of your home in the middle of the night ?

THOSE INTREPID ISRAELI SOLDIERS Israeli soldiers have sexually taunted Arab women in the occupied Gaza Strip during the three-week-long closure that has sealed Palestinians off from the Jewish state , Palestinian sources said on Sunday . The incidents occurred in the town of Khan Younis and involved soldiers of the Golani Brigade who have been at the centre of house-to-house raids for Palestinian activists during the closure , which was imposed on the strip and occupied West Bank . Five days ago girls at the Al-Khansaa secondary said a group of naked soldiers taunted them , yelling : `` Come and kiss me . '' When the girls fled , the soldiers threw empty bottles at them . On Saturday , a group of soldiers opened their shirts and pulled down their pants when they saw girls from Al-Khansaa walking home from school . Parents are considering keeping their daughters home from the all-girls school . The same day , soldiers harassed two passing schoolgirls after a youth escaped from them at a boys ' secondary school . Deputy Principal Srur Abu-Jamea said they shouted abusive language at the girls , backed them against a wall , and put their arms around them . When teacher Hamdan Abu-Hajras intervened the soldiers kicked him and beat him with the butts of their rifles . On Tuesday , troops stopped a car driven by Abdel Azzim Qdieh , a practising Moslem , and demanded he kiss his female passenger . Qdieh refused , the soldiers hit him and the 18-year-old passenger kissed him to stop the beating . On Friday , soldiers entered the home of Zamno Abu-Ealyan , 60 , blindfolded him and his wife , put a music tape on a recorder and demanded they dance . As the elderly couple danced , the soldiers slipped away . The coupled continued dancing until their grandson came in and asked what was happening . The army said it was checking the reports . ... ... ... ... ... ... .. ISRAELI TROOPS BAR CHRISTIANS FROM JERUSALEM Israeli troops prevented Christian Arabs from entering Jerusalem on Thursday to celebrate the traditional mass of the Last Supper . Two Arab priests from the Greek Orthodox church led some 30 worshippers in prayer at a checkpoint separating the occupied West Bank from Jerusalem after soldiers told them only people with army-issued permits could enter . `` Right now , our brothers are celebrating mass in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and we were hoping to be able to join them in prayer , '' said Father George Makhlouf of the Ramallah Parish . Israel sealed off the occupied lands two weeks ago after a spate of Palestinian attacks against Jews . The closure cut off Arabs in the West Bank and Gaza Strip from Jerusalem , their economic , spiritual and cultural centre . Father Nicola Akel said Christians did not want to suffer the humiliation of requesting permits to reach holy sites . Makhlouf said the closure was discriminatory , allowing Jews free movement to take part in recent Passover celebrations while restricting Christian celebrations . `` Yesterday , we saw the Jews celebrate Passover without any interruption . But we can not reach our holiest sites , '' he said . An Israeli officer interrupted Makhlouf 's speech , demanding to see his identity card before ordering the crowd to leave . ... ... ... ... ... ... .

Unless there has been a _major_ change in the law , there 's no such beast as a `` classified patent . '' Patents exist to encourage communications and develop the state of the art . While there are n't classified patents , there are `` patent secrecy orders '' . Suppose you invent a voice scrambler for CB radio , and apply for a patent . The Patent Office decides the NSA might be interested , gives them a copy of your application , and you get a nice note back saying your patent application has now been classified for national security reasons and you 're no longer allowed to make and sell it . I 'm picking this example because it happened in the late 1970s . It was probably some analog scrambler , and would have probably violated FCC rules anyway , but it did get classified . Or suppose you publish a paper on your Really Spiffy Algorithm and then file a patent application . Since it 's been published , they ca n't gain anything by classifying it , though you ca n't get patents in most countries other than the US , where patent laws are different . Obviously a system of classified patents would be highly bogus '' You ca n't sell that widget , because there 's a classified patent on it . You 're not allowed to see the patent , or know who owns the design , so just give us all your money and work in progress and maybe we wo n't throw you in jail for espionage .

Lets begin by saying that its whole rear end was definately Hawk 650 . Additionally , it had a CBR900RR style tank , full fairing , and only a tach . Now , at first I thought it was an 'RC31 ' ( a Hawk modified by Two Brothers Racing ) , but I did not think that they made this huge tank for it . Additionally , the gauges were certainly not from a Hawk . They looked much more like 900RR gauges . Overall , the bike looked like a 900RR except for the rear single-sided swingarm and wheel ( there were straight from the Hawk ) So , what did I see ? ( PS , for any of you Boulder DoDers , I saw it parked at the Engineering center today .

Only TV could transmit the full sadness of his face . `` You say that we teach our children to hate you , but what do you expect to happen to a child who sees this ? '' And once again he wraps himself in a lengthy silence , his face crumbling into weeping . Mahmoud stood in the field of rubble that was once his home . The term 'dispossession ' has an absolute meaning here . Nothing is left of what he accumulated during his entire life , only the rubble of a house and shreds of belongings . Once again Khan Yunis . Once again demolished homes . Last Thursday there was a search for wanted people here . Once again the IDF forces employed the new method , fired and bombed and shot missiles and placed explosives . Already three times during the past weeks I have gone out to see the destruction and each time I was more horrifying scenes . This time they hit the largest number of houses , 17 according to the IDF estimate , ten of them completely demolished . But not only that : the method has also become more brutal . Three weeks ago , in Tufah neighborhood in Gaza , the residents were still told to remove their valuables from their homes . This time the army skipped that part ; three weeks ago the handcuffed men , inhabitants of the demolished homes , were supplied with some water and one apple during the 12 hours they had to stand . This time there was only water . Three weeks ago they were even allowed to go out to the toilet . This time the soldier just gold them : Piss and shit in your pants . And thus , last Thursday , some 45 men stood for about 12 hours , their hands bound behind their backs , their eyes blindfolded , without food , with wet pants on their legs and a terrible feeling of humiliation in their hearts , listening to the sounds of the explosions destroying their homes , one after the other . ( ... ) Dr. Juma ' a Fuad Said al-Rubi . the brother from Saudi Arabia , emerges from among the ruins . Ten days ago he arrived for a family visit , mainly in order to celebrate the housewarming with his father and brothers . On Thursday he was handcuffed like everyone else for 12 hours , and later went with everyone to view the destrucion . He tried to explain that he was a visitor and that he is a physician , but only got a shove . Like all the rest he also urinated in his pants , while standing with his hands bound and his eyes blindfolded for the entire day . Juma ' a al-Rubi studied medicine at Cairo University , and for ten years he has been treating wealthy Saudis in Medina . His wife and four children remained there . Now his documents have been lost and he does not know how he will return to them . `` There is no humanity '' , stated the physician from Saudi Arabia .

Was the crucification the will of God or > a tragic mistake . I believe it was a tragic mistake . God 's will can > never be accomplished through the disbelief of man . I finished reading a very good book , `` The Will of God '' , Weatherhead . This was very helpful to me in applying thought to the subject of the will of God . Weatherhead broke the will of God into three distinct parts ; intentional will , circumstancial will , and ultimate will . He ( Weatherhead ) also refuted the last statement ( above ) by Michael Parkin above quite nicely . Summarizing ; _despite_ the failures of humankind , God 's ultimate will is never to be defeated . God 's intentions may be interfered with , even temporarily defeated by the will of humankind , brought down by circumstance . His ultimate will ( the reconcilication of all humankind ) will never be stopped . Time after time , Weatherhead used the Cross as the best description of this process at work . His points , paraphrased , were 1 ) God's intentional will was for Jesus , the Christ , to live out a full life and perform the work of the Living God . 2 ) The failures , sins , and deviousness of humankind frustrated God 's intent for His Son . 3 ) Despite the circumstance , God 's ultimate will was revealed in the Cross , as Jesus willingly ( `` not my will , Lord , but yours '' ) died for the redemption of all humankind . The Cross was utterly triumphant , overcoming even the most cruel of circumstances . > this world to build the kingdom of heaven on the earth .
