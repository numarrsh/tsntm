This is one of the differences between OT prophecy and NT prophecy . In the NT , it is expected that when believers gather , - people will prophesy - the prophecy must be judged ( 1 Cor 14:29 ) There is nothing about killing someone who makes a mistake . > To say that we make mistakes is true .

Scripture is scripture ; there is no `` gift of scripture '' . And I do n't know about you , but I know that _I_ have made mistakes while filled with the spirit . If you do n't give grace to allow people to make mistakes , they will never grow in the use of the spiritual gifts ! When we minister in my small group , I encourage people to speak out any impressions or images they think might be from the Lord . Only by trying will they know whether they were right or wrong -- and in either case , they 'll have a better handle on it the next time . Did n't you fall when you were learning to ride a bicycle ? But you kept on trying , and you learned both from your failures and your successes .

I have heard his voice -- not audibly ( though some have ) , but clearly nonetheless . Is what I heard equivalent to Scripture ? No . I have never heard contemporary prophets claim that what they receive from the Lord is on the same level as Scripture ; on the contrary , those who are mature obey the Scriptures by submitting their prophecies to fellow believers for judgement . And the most reliable yardstick for judging prophecies is , certainly , the Scriptures themselves . The canon is closed -- but God is not silent ! > Also interesting to note is that some so called prophecies are nothing new > but rather an inspired translation of scripture .

The initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links . For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting Americans . Rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth , privacy and law enforcement , previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement . Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer . It is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files . While encryption technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information , it also can be used by terrorists , drug dealers , and other criminals . A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the `` Clipper Chip '' has been developed by government engineers . The chip represents a new approach to encryption technology . It can be used in new , relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone . It scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today . This new technology will help companies protect proprietary information , protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically . At the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal , state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals . A `` key-escrow '' system will be established to ensure that the '' Clipper Chip '' is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding Americans . Each device containing the chip will have two unique 2 '' keys , '' numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device . When the device is manufactured , the two keys will be deposited separately in two `` key-escrow '' data bases that will be established by the Attorney General . Access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap . The `` Clipper Chip '' technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans . To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology , the Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices . In addition , respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings . The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption 's dual-edge sword : encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry , but it also can shield criminals and terrorists . We need the `` Clipper Chip '' and other approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities . In order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches ( like the key-escrow system ) , the President has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates : -- the privacy of our citizens , including the need to employ voice or data encryption for business purposes ; -- the ability of authorized officials to access telephone calls and data , under proper court or other legal order , when necessary to protect our citizens ; -- the effective and timely use of the most modern technology to build the National Information Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and the competitiveness of American industry in the global marketplace ; and -- the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export high technology products . The President has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries , the Congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed . 3 The Administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a National Information Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to information . This infrastructure of high-speed networks ( `` information superhighways '' ) will transmit video , images , HDTV programming , and huge data files as easily as today 's telephone system transmits voice . Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure , the Federal Government must act quickly to develop consistent , comprehensive policies regarding its use . The Administration is committed to policies that protect all Americans ' right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law . Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet . The provisions of the President 's directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also available .

A : No . `` Clipper Chip '' technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans . Q : Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation encrypted using the device . What would they have to do to decipher the message ? A : They would have to obtain legal authorization , normally a court order , to do the wiretap in the first place . They would then present documentation of this authorization to the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug smugglers . The key is split into two parts , which are stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key escrow system . Q : Who will run the key-escrow data banks ? A : The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent entities . At this point , the Department of Justice and the Administration have yet to determine which agencies will oversee the key-escrow data banks . Q : How strong is the security in the device ? How can I be sure how strong the security is ? A : This system is more secure than many other voice encryption systems readily available today . While the algorithm will remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow system , we are willing to invite an independent panel of cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all potential users that there are no unrecognized vulnerabilities . Q : Whose decision was it to propose this product ? A : The National Security Council , the Justice Department , the Commerce Department , and other key agencies were involved in this decision . This approach has been endorsed by the President , the Vice President , and appropriate Cabinet officials . Q : Who was consulted ? The Congress ? Industry ? A : We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on encryption issues , and expect those discussions to intensify as we carry out our review of encryption policy . We have briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the decisions related to this initiative . Q : Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers ? A : The government designed and developed the key access encryption microcircuits , but it is not providing the microcircuits to product manufacturers . Product manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip manufacturer that produces them . Q : Who provides the `` Clipper Chip '' ? A : Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance , California , and will sell the chip to encryption device manufacturers . The programming function could be licensed to other vendors in the future . Q : How do I buy one of these encryption devices ? A : We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating the `` Clipper Chip '' into their devices . Q : If the Administration were unable to find a technological solution like the one proposed , would the Administration be willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more powerful encryption devices ? A : This is a fundamental policy question which will be considered during the broad policy review . The key escrow mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product that is more secure , more convenient , and less expensive than others readily available today , but it is just one piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to encryption technology , which the Administration is developing . The Administration is not saying , `` since encryption threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement , we will prohibit it outright '' ( as some countries have effectively done ) ; nor is the U.S. saying that `` every American , as a matter of right , is entitled to an unbreakable commercial encryption product . '' There is a false `` tension '' created in the assessment that this issue is an `` either-or '' proposition . Rather , both concerns can be , and in fact are , harmoniously balanced through a reasoned , balanced approach such as is proposed with the `` Clipper Chip '' and similar encryption techniques . Q : What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton Administration 's policy toward encryption will differ from that of the Bush Administration ? A : It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption technology in telecommunications and computing and are committed to working with industry and public-interest groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans' privacy , help businesses to compete , and ensure that law enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime and terrorism . Q : Will the devices be exportable ? Will other devices that use the government hardware ? A : Voice encryption devices are subject to export control requirements . Case-by-case review for each export is required to ensure appropriate use of these devices . The same is true for other encryption devices . One of the attractions of this technology is the protection it can give to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad . With this in mind , we expect export licenses will be granted on a case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these devices to secure their own communications abroad . We plan to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability of these products . -- -- -- -- -- - End included article -- -- -- -- -- - -- pat @ rwing.uucp [ Without prejudice UCC 1-207 ] ( Pat Myrto ) Seattle , WA If all else fails , try : ... ! uunet ! pilchuck ! rwing ! pat WISDOM : `` Only two things are infinite ; the universe and human stupidity , and I am not sure about the former .

When I reinstall an MC68882RC25 the system works fine , but with the XC68882 even at 25 MHz it does not work . The designer of the board mentioned that putting a pullup resistor on data_strobe ( 470 Ohm ) might help , but that did n't change anything . Does anybody have some suggestions what I could do ? Does this look like a CPU-FPU communications problem or is the particular chip dead ( it is a pull , not new ) ? Moreover , the place I bought it from is sending me an XC68882RC33 .

Hams are unlikely to have an illegal amp , and are also unlikely to have a `` dirty '' amp . Hams can legally run up to 1500 watts . It is very unlikely , however , that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car . Ham rigs Not possible either . You 'd need about a 300 amp alternator for just the amplifier . I can just see it . You need to slow down on a downgrade , so you hit the push to talk button . for cars put out around 100 watts . It is possible that a 100 watt radio would cause interference to consumer electronic 100 feet away . Most TVs , stereos , and VCRs have very poor RF shielding . If you experience the problem frequently , it may be caused by a ham , CBer , or other radio operator in a base station nearby . The interference may have been caused by a radio transmitter used for other purposes , such as police , fire , etc . If you heard voices over your stereo , I think you are correct in assuming that the source is an RF transmitter . If you have frequent trouble , you may want to try the RF ferrite chokes available at Radio Shack . The interference is probably being picked up by your speaker wires , and those chokes can be installed on the wires very easily ( without cutting them ) . Good instructions are included with the chokes . If that does not solve the problem , you may want to search your neighborhood for a radio operator . Look for antennas on the roof or car . Talk to him/her about your problem . There are things a radio operator can do to reduce interference . And please remember to be friendly when approaching your local radio operator . This person may or may not be the cause of your troubles , and you 'll get better cooperation and help if you assume that he is going to be helpful ( most are ) . It was amazing the accusations that we sometimes dealt with as I grew up . We were blamed for skip ( ghost pictures on the TV that occur at sunspot peaks ) , c.b . interferance , dead grass : ) , you name it . BTW , the local operator should try and help you whether or not he or she is directly responsible . It is part of being a good neighbor and that is how the FCC views it . Too bad they do n't require the consumer equipment makers to take any precautions . Last , you can usually tell ham radio vs. CB . Ham operators are required to declare their call ( sign ) every so many minutes ( no more than 10 ) . So if you hear `` This is WA1QT '' or some other call starting with A , W or K and no more than 6 total characters , you heard a ham . CB'ers probably wo n't sign ( I do n't know that they 're even required to ) and fire/police have other private ids . -- Douglas S. Rand < drand @ osf.org > OSF/Motif Dev .

The Trib . would run a graphic of a handgun . The Examiner would not have a Traders ad at all .

Organization : Imax Corporation , Mississauga Canada Lines : 24 jeh @ cmkrnl.com writes : > > Hmmm . How are those orange `` isolated ground '' outlets ( often used in > computer rooms ) wired ? They require two separate grounds . One ground goes to the ground pin of the outlet , and the other ground wire is connected to the outlet's mounting tabs ( and thus grounds the box and faceplate screw and metal faceplate , if any ) . The box/faceplate ground goes to the normal distribution panel ground . The outlet ground-pin wire is generally connected to an insulated busbar in the distribution panel which is , in turn , connected to the building-entrance main ground by its own wire . So the two separate ground systems are connected together at the building 's service entrance . But one is also connected to every grounded piece of electrical equipment in the whole building , while the isolated ground is shared only by the equipment plugged into isolated-ground outlets of that panel . If someone happens to accidentally short one phase of a 600V feeder to ground , the main building ground is likely to have a lot of noise on it until the breaker trips or the fuse blows , while the isolated ground will remain relatively noise-free .

Windows : The recent reviews have all shown that the P9000 cards are significantly faster doing Windows than the ATI card . VGA : The recent reviews have all shown that the P9000 cards they looked at are significantly slower doing VGA than the ATI card . About 1/2 the speed , as I recall . The big question for me is the Orchid V9000 card . Each of the P9000 cards tested so far has had the W5186 to do VGA . Orchid is the only one I know about ( I do n't know about AMI ) that uses the W5286 for VGA . That is reportedly faster . I would like to know whether the Orchid card can do VGA as fast as the ATI card . If so , it would appear to be a formidable competitor . ( Advertised prices are about the same for the two cards . ) Someone in this group posted a little while back that they were getting an Orchid V9000 card -- has that card arrived ? What do the benchmarks look like ? Also , is the AMI P9000-based card real ? What does it use for VGA ? Speed ? -- Bob

Roger , on one front you flamed him rather severely on the grounds that his was a `` jingoistic rant '' , but you also supported the name-changing on the grounds that the current names are inappropriate because of the individuals they represent . FWIW , I do not think the flaming was warranted , nor do I think you enhanced what credibility you have with it at all . Just an observation ... However , that aside , the real question is whether you like the idea of changing the names based on the reasons given for it ( making it easier for the 'casual fan ' ) , or whether you like the idea of unique divisional names based on individuals who do deserve the honour . IMO , the latter is a nice and unique touch that differs from other sports . In addition , I do not think that changing divisional names will have an effect on the number of people that are interested in hockey , so it 's a pointless exercise anyway . If the current names are inappropriate , then that is a separate issue , not central to the original article . Something to consider additionally is whether or not players like Orr who 'contributed to the glory of the sport' would have been able to do so _without_ an organized professional league to play in . In this case , honouring builders of the _league_ as opposed to builders of the _sport_ becomes a chicken-and-egg type question . ( although it was the chicken ... .. ) > Exactly true .

The point that Darren raises is a very Lutheran viewpoint . While reason is a gift from God , it is also infected by sin . Yet we do not reject reason entirely -- and neither , I think , does Darren . We need reason , as Darren himself has pointed out , to comprehend God 's revelation of himself in the Bible . But reason alone is not sufficient to comprehend and believe the Word . We need , first and foremost , faith . For `` the sinful mind is hostile to God . It does not submit to God 's law , *nor can it do so* '' ( Romans 8:7 ) . Luther accepted Scripture as the sole means of revelation ( `` Sola Scriptura '' ) , but accepted the necessity of the use of reason ( with faith ) in comprehending that revelation . Yet Luther also said , regarding baptism , `` But mad reason rushes forth , and , because Baptism is not dazzling like the works which we do , regards it as worthless . '' ( Large Catechism , Fourth part , Baptism ) . To make matters more complicated , Luther was the sort of theologian that many people would describe as an ` absolutist ' . I 've seen him described as a ` take no prisoners ' theologian . We might conclude , given these observations , that Luther was inconsistent or mad . And surely at least some have come to that conclusion . But it might be useful to recall that Jesus was also called mad . And Peter felt compelled to defend himself and the apostles against a charge of drunkenness on Pentecost . So we as Christians ought to be careful about rejecting Luther ( or others ) as mad . Rather , we should imitate the Bereans , who examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true ( Acts 17:11 ) . The basis for the confidence with which Luther , Peter , Paul , and many others preached the gospel was not just reason , but faith and the Holy Spirit . This is not faith divorced from reason , but a faith that guides , informs , and uses reason . The Spirit enables us to know the truth and to proclaim it boldly . God does not want us to preach the message that `` I think that Jesus might have risen from the dead '' but rather `` I know that my redeemer lives ! '' ( Job 19:25 ) . The Christian does not side with Pilate in saying `` What is truth ? '' but rather follows Christ , who said , `` In fact , for this reason I was born , and for this I came into the world , to testify to the truth . Everyone on the side of truth listens to me '' ( John 18:37 ) . We can know the truth because God has promised us that we can know the truth . Jesus said , `` If you hold to my teachings , you are really my disciples . Then you will know the truth , and the truth will set you free '' ( John 8:31,32 ) . The Proverbs urge us `` Buy the truth , and do not sell it . '' ( Pr 23:23 ) . The Psalmist prayed `` Do not snatch to word of truth from my mouth '' ( Ps 119:43 ) . Evidently he believed that the word of truth was in fact ` in his mouth ' . Yet we do indeed appear arrogant if our claim to the truth is motivated by self-glorification . But if we present the truth as the teachings of Scripture , revealed by the Spirit , and not our own invention , and if we stand ready to be proved wrong on the basis of Scripture , as Luther did , then we are not arrogant , but humble . We should humbly trust in God 's promise of truth , just as we trust in his promise of forgiveness . REXLEX > It is only because of God 's own revelation that we can be REXLEX > absolute about a thing . Darren > But how far does that get you ? Once God 's revelation stops , Darren > and your own reasoning begins , possibility for error appears . I agree that we must make a distinction between the clear teachings of Scripture , and the products of our own reason -- even when such reasoning is based on Scripture . However I think I would draw the line of distinction more ` reasonably ' : - ) and less ` academically' than you would . Darren > For example , let 's suppose that our modern Bible translations Darren > include a perfect rendering of Jesus words at the Last Supper , Darren > and that Jesus said , exactly , `` This is my body . '' Darren > We 'll presume that what he said was totally without error and Darren > absolutely true . What can we be certain of ? Not much . Darren > At the moment he stops speaking , and people start Darren > interpreting , the possibility of error appears . Did he mean Darren > that literally or not ? We do not have any record that he Darren > elaborated on the words . Was he thinking of Tran- or Con- Darren > substantiation ? He did n't say . Darren is almost at the point of making a very Lutheran statement about the Lord 's supper . The Lutheran approach is to say that if Jesus said , `` This is my body , '' then that is what we should believe . Other interpretations are rejected simply because they are not taught in Scripture . Recall that Jesus ' words do not stand alone on this subject . We also have Paul 's words in 1 Corinthians 11:17-34 , -- in which he passed on to us , what he received from the Lord . In particular he said , `` For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup , you proclaim the Lord 's death until he comes . '' By these words we should believe that the bread that we eat in the Lord 's Supper really is bread ( as well as the Lord 's body ) -- as our senses in fact tell us . Does this *prove* that tran-substantiation is false ? I suppose someone could say that Paul spoke metaphorically of the Lord 's body as bread , simply because that is the way the body appears when we eat it . But this thought is found nowhere in Scripture . So we reject it . Thus the primary reason for rejecting tran-substantiation is not that we can prove it false , but that it is simply not found in Scripture . [ side remark ] I 've been told that the Lutheran doctrine on real presence is con-substantiation . But it has been non-Lutherans who have told me this . We tend not to use the word . I almost think that this is used more by professors of comparative religion , who need labels to compare Catholic , Lutheran and Reformed teachings on the Lord's Supper . But almost every church wants to call their own teaching '' real presence '' because that was the traditional teaching of the church . [ end side remark ] Darren > When Christians speak as if they believe their own reasoning Darren > can never lead them astray -- when we implicitly claim that we Darren > are infallible -- the non- Christians around us rarely believe Darren > that implicit claim . Witnessing is hardly going to work when Darren > the person you are talking to believes that you are either too Darren > foolish to recognise your own limits , or intentionally trying Darren > to cover them up . This is precisely why Christians should not rely on rationalizations in their witnessing . It is far better to take the approach , '' I 'd like to show you what Scripture says .

However , I 'd suggest Kelly Buchberger instead of Dave Manson , who has had a brutal year , his pick for the All-Star game notwithstanding . As for biggest surprise , I 'd say that Buchberger had higher expectations this year due to his `` breakthrough '' year ( for him ) last year , so he didn't really raise his game . My suggestion would be Shjon Podein , one of the callups from Cape Breton during the year . He was quite far down on the depth chart in the Oilers stable of prospects , but made a big impact on the team . He has 12 goals in his 33 games and is only -1 . Those are decent numbers for a third-line player who was seemingly doomed to minor-league oblivion . The Oilers coaching staff likens his style to John Tonelli . I think he 'll be on the full-time roster next year .

Hear ! Hear ! I agree completely . One thing I ca n't stand about the Mac interface is its shear determination to FORCE you to use the mouse ( what if your mouse breaks -- your whole system is down ! ) . I like the mouse -- it is handy on some occassions such as cut and past and moving icons around , etc . But for most work , the keyboard and hot keys are 10-20 times faster than using the mouse . Sure it is a plus to be able to do something simple if you are an inexperienced user , but how long is it before your are experienced ? A month ? Two ? ( Speaking of PCs at the moment . ) I do n't think it is too much to ask that window programmers provide not only a menu/mouse interface but also look forward to those who would like to move on to hot keys and command line interfaces , which usually allows you to do more in less time IF you are experienced . All of the above equally applies to windowing systems on UNIX ( especially since Unix is at least 500 % more powerful than DOS ) . -- \ -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -/ \ Seth Buffington U.S.S .

The training course will discuss the applications of satellite data concerning natural resources , renewable energy and the environment . The training course , organised for the benefit of francophone African experts , will be hosted by ESRIN , the European Space Agency 's establishment in Frascati , which is responsible for coordination with the users of data from ESA 's remote sensing satellite . Twenty-four experts in the field of remote sensing , selected from 19 francophone countries from northern , western and central Africa , and three regional African centres , will attend the two-week session . The course will focus on remote sensing techniques and data applications , particularly ERS-1 data . The ERS-1 satellite , developed by ESA and launched in 1991 with the European Ariane launcher , carries an advanced radar instrument and is the first in a series of radar remote sensing missions that will ensure availability of data beyond the year 2000 . The aim of the training course is to increase the potential of experts using the practical applications of radar remote sensing systems to natural resources , renewable energy and the environment , with particular emphasis on applications to geology and mineral prospecting , oceanography and near- coastal areas , agriculture , forestry and meteorology . The education and practical training programme was developed jointly by the United Nations and ESA . The facilities and the technical support , as well as lecturers and information documents for the training course , will be provided by the Agency . Lecturers at the training course will include high-level experts from other European and African organisations active in remote sensing applications . Funds for the training course are being provided by the United Nations Trust Fund for New and Renewable Sources of Energy ; the primary contributor to that Fund is the Government of Italy . A similar training course is being planned for Latin American experts .

Further , does Israel 's new policy concerning > direct negotiations with the PLO hold any substance to the situation > as a whole ? No , he does not . Arafat explicitly *denies* this claim . from a Libyan televison interview with Yasser Arafat 7-19-1991 Q : Some people say that the Palestinian revolution has many times changed its strategies and tactics , something which has left its imprint on the Palestinian problem and on the Palestinian Liberation Front . The [ strategies and tactics ] have not been clear . The question is , is the direction of the Palestinian problem clear ? The Palestinian leadership has stopped , or at least this is what has been said in the media , this happened on the way to the dialogue with the United States , the PLO recognized something called `` Israel '' ... A : No , no , no ! We do not recognize the State of Israel . We said `` recognition '' -- when a Palestinian state is established . It will then decide if to recognize Israel or not . When it is established , its parliament will convene and decide . > policies which it can justify through occupation . Because of this , > you have the grassroot movements that reject Israel 's authority and > disregard for human rights ; and , if Israel was serious about peace , it > would abandon these policies . And replace them with what ? If Israel is to withdraw its control of any territory , there must be two prerequsites . One is that it leads to a reduction in deaths . The second is that it should not weaken Israels bargianing position with respect to peace talks . Leaving Gaza unilateraly is a bad idea because it encourages arabs to think they can get what they want by killing Jews . The only way Israel should pull out of Gaza is at the end of negotiations . These negotiations should lead to a mutually agreeable solution with security guarantees for both sides . Until arabs are ready to sit down at the table and talk again , they should not expect , or recieve more concessions .

I built 10 watt FSK transceivers at 904 MHz . They are essentially double conversion transverters with digital mod and demod at 29 MHz . The receiver uses the MC13055 which is the same FSK receiver chip I used previouslyu in the 2 Mbps 10 GHz data link I first published in Ham Radio and which is now also in the ARRL handbook . The MC3356 , which includes a VHF converter section , could also be used at these speeds . There is a newer and perhaps slightly improved design of this ( the MC13056 if I remember rightly ) . While using this would have let me reduce the `` external '' IF count on receive , it did n't really offer all that much help on transmit so I did n't bother with it . The radios I built were first designed and built for 512 kbps in a 2 MHz channel but later reduced to half that . These 256 kbps radios actually have done quite well in across-the-bench tests at 384 kbps and speed is pretty much a function of filter design . Handling the data stream is another matter entirely . Some of the existing radios are currently deployed on hilltops in a '' beacon '' test mode . While there is not yet end-end two-way data flow due to lack of resources to debug software for the digital hardware ( MIO also shown in the CNC proceedings ) , data is perfect copy at n6gn . Even though the data clock is currently at about half speed , the a 2+ kbytes of the test text ( chapter 55 of Isaiah ) takes only a little over 1/8 of a second . I 've been hoping that someone would get interested enough to step in and get involved in writing code to make the whole thing usable ( Borland IDE environment with remote debugging possible as mentioned in the proceedings ) but to date a couple of us have been on our own and running low on resources of time , money and energy . If anyone in the SF bay area wants to check it out there is also a CW ID after the text on the mark side at 904.740 MHz from beacons on Sonoma Mtn and Black Mtn ( overlooking Si valley ) . The antenna is horizontally polarized . I guess in retrospect my suggestions are that this is a fairly costly approach if the radios are intended for users rather than backbones and you might want to carefully consider your `` target '' . If you can't arrange your paths such that you have complete line-of-sight I think you 'll want to address the inter-symbol-interference caused by multipath and probably link C/N budgets if paths are very far from LOS . For more details , see the 10th CNC . I 'm currently working on a spread spectrum , direct conversion design to address some of these problems . I 'd be glad to help as I can with any design problems . 73 Glenn Elmore n6gn N6GN @ K3MC amateur IP : glenn @ SantaRosa.ampr.org Internet : glenne @ sr.hp.com

ADVOCATE OF LUNAR POWER SYSTEM AS ENERGY SOURCE FOR THE WORLD On April 21 , the OASIS and Ventura County chapters of the National Space Society will sponsor a talk by Lunar Power System ( LPS ) co- inventor and vice-president of the LPS Coalition , Dr. Robert D. Waldron . It will be held at 7:30 p.m. at the Rockwell Science Center in Thousand Oaks , CA . Dr. Waldron is currently a Technical Specialist in Space Materials Processing with the Space Systems Division of Rockwell International in Downey , California . He is a recognized world authority on lunar materials refinement . He has written or coauthored more than 15 articles or reports on nonterrestrial materials processing or utilization . Along with Dr. David Criswell , Waldron invented the lunar/solar power system concept . Momentum is building for a coalition of entrepreneurs , legal experts , and Soviet and U.S. scientists and engineers to build the Lunar Power System , a pollution-free , energy source with a potential to power the globe . For the past three years members of the coalition , nearly half from California , have rejuvenated the commercial and scientific concept of a solar power system based on the Moon . The LPS concept entails collecting solar energy on the lunar surface and beaming the power to Earth as microwaves transmitted through orbiting antennae . A mature LPS offers an enormous source of clean , sustainable power to meet the Earth 's ever increasing demand using proven , basic technology . OASIS ( Organization for the Advancement of Space Industrialization ) is the Greater Los Angeles chapter of the National Space Society , which is an international non-profit organization that promotes development of the space frontier .

The problem is that maintenance costs on these two cars is running about $ 4000 per year and insurance $ 3000 per year . What am I doing wrong ? Within the last two months , the follows costs have occured : Dodge 600 SE ( Dodge 's attempt at the American German car ! ) $ 1,000 - replace head gasket $ 300 - new radiator Chevy Nova CL ( Chevy 's attempt at a Japan import ! ) $ 500 - tune-up , oil change , valve gasket , middle exhaust pipe , misc . Note also that the Chevy Nova CL ( 1987 ) has only 70 horsepwer ! Does anyone out there have a Chevy Nova with enough power to get up even a small hill without knocking ? Is there something wrong with my car , I even use 93 octane gas ! ( I have consider going to 110 octane if I can find it ! ) Anyway , what are the best maintenance items to do-it-yourself , and what equipment is needed ?

But they can make you piss in a jar , and possibly provide DNA , semen , and hair samples or to undergo tests for gunpowder residues on your hand . ( BTW , that was why the chemical engineer arrested in the WTC explosion thrust his hands into a toilet filled with urine as the cops were breaking down the door -- the nitrogen in the urine would mask any residue from explosives . I found it interesting the news reported his acts , but not his reasons ) . Somewhere , perhaps a privacy group , they discussed the legal ramifications of using a password like I shot Jimmy Hoffa and his body is in a storage locker in Camden a while back . The impression I got was that real judges would dismiss arguments that this password is self-incrimination as first-year law school sophistry -- the fact that you use a statement for a password has no bearing on the veracity of that phrase . You are not being asked to incrimidate yourself ( e.g. , `` where did you bury the body ? `` ) ; you are being asked to provide information necessary to execute a legal search warrant . Refusing to provide the password is akin to refusing to provide a key to a storage locker ... except that they could always _force_ their way into the locker . Of course , that does n't mean you have to help them _understand_ what they find , or point out things they overlooked in their search ! -- Bear Giles bear @ fsl.noaa.gov

At the same It seems sad that people lose all perspective when they here about a case of violence by teenagers ... For a little perspective : How about the thousands of kind teenagers who volunteer at local agencies to help children , seniors , the homeless ? Did you read about all the kids at Stanford who spent their spring breaks helping out in inner city areas ? What about the hundreds of volunteers ( teenagers and others ) who worked to clean up the mess after the Rodney King riots in LA ? Have you gone to your local high school play recently ? Attended the school orchestra performances ? Have you seen how many kids volunteer to pick up trash , plant trees , do walk-a-thons ? How many kids have tried to sell you stuff to benefit organizations they belong to ? How many girl scout cookies have you bought ? How many chocolate bars for good causes ? The media picks up on all the anomalies , the sensational ... What about the wonderful teenagers all over the place who work hard at school , get good grades , go to college ( or to work ) and make a real contribution to our society ? All humans are teenagers at some time in their lives ! Mother Theresa was a teenager and so was Geoffrey Dahmer . It is really sad to see so many people who buy the sensational reporting of the media as some kind of reflection of the world today ! It is a reflection of what is happening on the outer fringes of our society and nothing more ... rf

I 'm thinking that education suppliers for schools might have a appartus for sale , but I do n't know any of the companies . Any info is greatly appreciated . In case you do n't know , Krillean Photography , to the best of my knowledge , involves taking pictures of an ( most of the time ) organic object between charged plates . The picture will show energy patterns or spikes around the object photographed , and depending on what type of object it is , the spikes or energy patterns will vary . One might extrapolate here and say that this proves that every object within the universe ( as we know it ) has its own energy signature . There have been a number of scientific papers ( in peer-reviewed journals ) published about Kirlian photography in the early 1970s . Sorry I ca n't be more specific but it is a long time since I read them . They would describe what is needed and how to set up the apparatus . These papers demonstrate that the auras obtained by Kirlian photography can be completely explained by the effect of the electric currents used on the moisture in the object being photographed . It has nothing to do with the '' energy signature '' of organic objects . I did a science project on Kirlian photography when I was in high school . I was able to obtain wonderful auras from rocks and pebbles and the like by first dunking them in water .

Sci . Lines : 74 I 've noticed that is has become fashionable lately in rsb to predict the Marlines to finish ahead of the Cubs ... .how ? First Base : Grace vs Destrade ... Could Destrade be the second coming of Cecil Fielder ? I doubt it . If Destrade performs to the height of expectations , then even , otherwise , edge to Cubs Second Base : Sandberg vs Barberie ... No contest . Sandberg will be back May 1 . Edge to Cubs ... a big edge . Shortstop : Vizcaino vs Weiss ... Vizcaino is excellent defensively , but is an automatic out at bat . Weiss is n't much better with the stick . Even . Third Base : Dave Magadan vs Buechelle ... Magadan has a higher OBP and is a better hitter . Buechelle has more power and is better defensively ( I think ) Edge to Florida . Catcher : Santiago vs Wilkins ... Wilkins is OK , but Santiago is better . Edge to Marlins Left Field : Conine vs Maldonado ... Wow ! 4 for 4 yesterday ... I know Conine has potential . I watched him play at Omaha the last couple years . Until he actually proves himself , I give Maldonado the edge , however , like at 1B , this is position where Florida might be even or better *if* the player there has a huge year . Center : Scott Pose vs Wilson/May ... Edge to May , even if Wilson . Hopefully the Cubs will use may and save Wilson for pinch running and the like . May is n't Ken Griffey Jr , but he will hit .275 with 15 homers if he plays full time . Right : Felix vs Sosa ... Felix Jose has occasional power and a bad OBP . So does Sosa , but Sosa also has speed and a good glove . Edge to Cubs Starters : Aquino ? Armstrong ? Hammond ? A lot of fifth starters here . The Cubs won't remind anyone of the Brave staff , but Morgan-Castillo-Guzman-Hibbard is average to OK ... better than the Marline . Edge to Cubs Middle Relief : Even . The Cubs have some decent middlemen , and so do the Marlins . Carpenter anf Klink or decent , but so are Assenmacher and McElroy . Closer : A healthy Harvey is a big edge to the Marlins . Meyers is decent , but no Harvey . Of course , the Cubs may have a few more games to save . Look for 30 saves , 5 blown from Meyers , and 25 saves , 3 blown ( with a better ERA ) for Harvey . Edge Florida . Overall , an edge to Chicago .

If you have corrections or answers to other frequently asked questions that you would like included in this posting , send email to leech @ cs.unc.edu ( Jon Leech ) . If you do n't want to see the FAQ , add 'Frequently Asked Questions ' to your KILL file for this group ( if you 're not reading this with a newsreader that can kill articles by subject , you 're out of luck ) . The FAQ volume is excessive right now and will hopefully be trimmed down by rewriting and condensing over time . The FAQ postings are available in the Ames SPACE archive in FAQ/faq < # > . Good summaries will be accepted in place of the answers given here . The point of this is to circulate existing information , and avoid rehashing old answers . Better to build on top than start again . Nothing more depressing than rehashing old topics for the 100th time . References are provided because they give more complete information than any short generalization . Questions fall into three basic types : 1 ) Where do I find some information about space ? Try your local public library first . The net is not a good place to ask for general information . Ask INDIVIDUALS ( by email ) if you must . There are other sources , use them , too . The net is a place for open ended discussion . 2 ) I have an idea which would improve space flight ? Hope you are n't surprised , but 9,999 out of 10,000 have usually been thought of before . Again , contact a direct individual source for evaluation . NASA fields thousands of these each day . 3 ) Miscellanous queries . These are addressed on a case-by-case basis in the following series of FAQ postings . SUGGESTIONS FOR BETTER NETIQUETTE Read news.announce.newusers if you 're on Usenet . Minimize cross references , [ Do you REALLY NEED to ? ] Edit `` Subject : '' lines , especially if you 're taking a tangent . Send mail instead , avoid posting follow ups . ( 1 mail message worth 100 posts ) . Internet mail readers : send requests to add/drop to SPACE-REQUEST not SPACE . Read all available articles before posting a follow-up .

I fail to see how citing results from > peer-reviewed studies qualifies as `` bizarrely cracked '' . That 's because these `` peer-reviewed '' studies are not addressing the effects of MSG in people , they 're looking at animal models . You ca n't walk away from this and start ranting about gloom and doom as if there were any documented deleterious health effects demonstrated in humans . Note that I would n't have any argument with a statement like `` noting that animal administration has pro- duced the following [ blah , blah ] , we must be careful about its use in humans . '' This is precisely NOT what you said . > Tests have been done on Rhesus monkeys , as well . I have never seen a > study where the mode of administration was intra-ventricular .

So , point us to the studies in humans , please . I 'm familiar with the literature , and I 've never seen any which relate at all to Olney 's work in animals and the effects of glutamate on neurons . > The point is exceeding the window . Of course , they 're amino acids . > Note that people with PKU can not tolerate any phenylalanine . Well , actually , they HAVE to tolerate some phenylalanine ; it 's a essential amino acid . They just try to get as little as is healthy without producing dangerous levels of phenylalanine and its metabolites in the blood . > Olney 's research compared infant human diets .

He found that one could exceed the projected safety margin > for infant humans by at least four-fold in a single meal of processed > foods . Mother 's milk was well below the effective dose . Goodness , I 'm not saying that it 's good to feed infants a lot of glutamate-supplemented foods . It 's just that this `` projected safety margin '' is a construct derived from animal models and given that , you can `` prove '' anything you like . We 're talking prudent policy in infant nutrition here , yet you 're misrepresenting it as received wisdom . > > > Read Olney 's review paper in Prog .

I would be most interested in seeing you > provide peer-reviewed non-food-industry-funded citations to articles > disputing that MSG has no effects whatsoever . You mean `` asserting '' . You 're being intellectually dishonest ( or just plain confused ) , because you 're conflating reports which do not necessarily have anything to do with each other . Olney 's reports would argue a potential for problems in human infants , but that 's not to say that this says anything whatsoever about the use of MSG in most foods , nor does he provide any studies in humans which indicate any deleterious effects ( for obvious reasons . ) It says nothing about MSG 's contribtion to the phenomenon of the `` Chinese Restaurant Syndrome '' .

Derby ) Expires : Sun , 25 Apr 1993 04:00:00 GMT Organization : Virginia Commonwealth University Lines : 14 I personally will never forget Mike Schmidt 's home run against the Expos in 1980 that decided the NL East . It was also his career high 48th . Another home run that I thought was totally incredible was in the 1986 ALCS . The CA Angles had the Boston Red Sox *1* strike away from the pennant until Don Baylor hit a two strike pitch for a home run . That was the most incredible turn of events I have EVER seen in baseball . The Sox later took the pennant away only to have the same thing done to them in the WS against the Mets . Speaking of the METS , is n't it strange how the NLCS that year with the Astros ALMOST mirrored the 1980 NLCS with the Phillies ? ? The Astros have been painfully close twice I must admit .

Even if you ignore the nonsense of the above statement for a moment , and even if you are happy with such system and the current escrow agencies NOW , what guarantees that you 'll be happy with them TOMORROW , when the government changes ? Or when the current government throws away the sheep skin ? All the sheep who are reasoning like you will get caught by surprise , but it will be too late , because then cryptography that is not guaranteed to be breakable by the government will already have been outlawed ... After all , you 've already got privacy that is said to be breakable only by the law enforcement agencies , so if you are law-abiding , you have no reasons to use a stronger one , right ? So , if you are using a stronger one , you have something to hide from the law enforcement agencies , right ? Something unlawful , right ? Therefore , strong crypto is a clear idndication that you are doing something unlawful . > I 'd trust the NSA or the President if they stated there were no trap Considering the level of competence in cryptology that you have demonstrated in your messages , you would trust just anything ...

Ave. , Cambridge , MA 02139 , USA +1 ( 617 ) 876-3296 Lines : 1135 NNTP-Posting-Host : life.ai.mit.edu THE WHITE HOUSE Office of the Press Secretary _____________________________________________________________________ For Immediate Release April 15 , 1993 PRESS BRIEFING BY GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS The Briefing Room 1:04 P.M. EDT MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Good afternoon . Q Could we do this on the lawn ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : That would be nice . Let 's go out to the cherry blossoms . We 'll do like the President . Q Is the stimulus package dead ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Absolutely not . Q Can you tell us more about the Dole talks ? You said it was a good visit , but no compromise . MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Yes . The President had a good talk with Senator Dole last night . I think that as we said before , there were no specific compromises on either side , although it was a very good discussion about the jobs package and about other issues as well . As you know , the President first called Senator Dole I believe Tuesday night to talk about the Russian aid package . They did not speak -- Senator Dole called him back Wednesday morning -- when the President was out . Instead he spoke with Tony Lake , and at the close of that conversation , indicated that he wanted to speak to the President about the jobs and stimulus package . They finally talked about that yesterday afternoon . At the close of that discussion they said that they would have another talk last night , which they did , when the Senator was up in New Hampshire . And although there were no specific compromises made on either side , they did say that they would continue to have some discussions . And that 's where we are . Q Well , who is giving in ? Where is it standing -- are both making concessions ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I do n't know that it 's at that phase . No compromise has been made . As the President has said consistently , he intends to come forward with an adjusted package . He believes in the package , but he believes that if it 's going to take adjustments to get the minority to release it , he 's willing to make those adjustments . Q On the subject of a VAT -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Oh , boy . Q Can we stay on this for one more minute ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Sure . Q We have a problem with the five minutes -- Q I know no decisions have been made , but what would lead the health group to believe that a VAT might be necessary ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Sorry , Andrea , I 'm not going to go down that road . No decisions have been made . As the President said this morning , a number of groups , a number of members of Congress , a number of other organizations have recommended that this be looked at . The working group is looking at it , but no decisions have been made . Q To follow , have they done that directly through him ? Have labor and business groups been in touch with the President about it ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Not to my knowledge , although there 's a lot of people who have public decisions in support of the VAT . But the President has not made a decision . Q At the meetings that he 's had with his own task force advisers , have they discussed the funding issue and what the possible options would be ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I do n't think that that has been presented for a decision , no . Q Not for a decision , but has it been discussed as an option ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Again , there are a lot of levels of briefing . I do not believe that the VAT has been presented to the President as , okay , this is something for you to decide on . Q You 're not saying he did n't know it was being considered , though , are you ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : No , he said it 's being considered . Q He knew that . Q But has he discussed that with his advisers ? That 's what I 'm asking . MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : The President has said it 's being considered . I do not know what level of discussion there has been over the VAT . It is something the working groups are looking at . I do n't even know that it 's -- Q But he did n't say he was considering , did he , at this stage ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : No , he is not . I think we 're getting into something of a metaphysical debate right here . What is considered -- Q Well , he is the one who said , I have n't reviewed it . MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : That is true . That is what I just repeated . Q George , is there any concern here that as a result of the definite statement he made in February and the promise that if it were to be considered he 'd let us know , and having it trickle out the way it did , that there may now be the development of a credibility gap on this issue and others ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I do n't think so . I mean , it is now public knowledge that this is being considered . Q Is he or you at all embarrassed about the absolute statements that were made from this platform to the effect that it was off the table and was not being considered , and then to have it come out not from you people , but -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Well , wait a second . It came out from the administration . What are you talking about ? Q What I 'm saying is , though , that the President said he would let us know . MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Right . Q You people then said -- you said , I believe , that it 's not going to be on the program . MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : On March 25th . Q On March 25th . MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Circumstances change . Q Well , I understand . But we have to find that out by rooting around in the fine print of an interview MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Rooting around -- I know you did do a very good job there to read the USA Today article . But this is -- ( laughter ) -- the Deputy Director of the OMB and the Secretary of Health and Human Services . I mean , that is common anytime you guys write a story that has an unattributed quote from somebody in the Clinton administration , the headline is -- I 'll look at it right here , and AP story -- `` Clinton wants more money for spying . '' Q What about his remark that if it were being considered , he 'd tell us about it ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : And the administration 's concerned , and he 'd let you know . Q And did he ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Yes . Absolutely . What did he say this morning ? Q It had to be dragged out of you here yesterday . MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : It did n't have to be dragged out of me . We had the Deputy Director of the OMB , we had the Secretary of Health of Human Services say it was being considered . That is his administration . That is his administration policy . Q Were these authorized trial balloons , or were they orchestrated leaks ? I mean , what was the -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : They were asked questions , they answered the questions . Q You 're saying here that it did n't have to be dragged out , that you more or less made it clear yesterday you were considering it . MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Absolutely . I was very clear . Painfully clear . Q Was there a particular political strategy in making it clear the administration is considering a new tax increase on tax day ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : No , it was just this issue is being considered . They were asked if it was being considered ; they answered that it was being considered . Q George , The New York Times -- Q Why do it yesterday ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : They were asked . Q The New York Times reports today that Secretary Reich and the chief economist at the Labor Department used apples and oranges numbers in order to portray last month 's unemployment figures in a way that was supportive of the President 's job stimulus bill , but which turned out to be totally false . MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I do n't know if it was totally false , but I think -- ( laughter ) -- the chief economist at the Labor Department did grant that it was an inappropriate mixing , and they say that . Q The question is , is the President concerned about behavior that amounts to corrupting government data ? And what 's he doing about it , if so ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : The chief economist has said that a mistake was made , it wo n't happen again , and that 's the end of the matter . Q Is n't that the same information that goes to the President ? Q If I could go back to the stimulus package -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : There 's two separate pieces of information . I think that 's where the confusion was . Q When did you all first learn about this mistake that was made ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I read the article this morning . Q And as far as you know , is the President aware of it ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I think so . Q And was he aware of it before he read about it in The New York Times ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I do n't know . Not to my knowledge . Q Did you ever hear about it before this morning ? Anything ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I did n't . Q Was n't the President given an erroneous spin on this for his own purpose ? For his speeches , for his arguments ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Well again , I 'm not sure . Both statements are true . What the Labor Department has granted is that mixing them in one sentence , essentially , was misleading . They said it was a mistake . They said they would n't do it again . Q Did they drop it -- is this something that you choose to spin or make an issue of ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Whenever fewer people are out of work , we 're gratified . But that does n't take away from the need to get this jobs package going . Q If I could go back to the stimulus package for a minute . You said that the President plans to come forward with an amendment . Is the timetable still what it was -- that the amendment would be laid down on Monday and voted on on Tuesday , or did he , in the conversation with Dole , talk about the possibility of putting that off for a few more days to give more time for the discussion ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I think at this point there 's no changes in the schedule at all . I do n't know that they discussed the timing like that . Q Do you believe that you 're closer or getting closer this week than you were last week ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Again , I believe that we 're going to pass a jobs package . The President is prepared to make adjustments in order to get that to happen . I do n't know where the votes are on cloture at this particular time . I do n't know what 's going to happen until we have a vote . But the President believes deeply in this jobs package and wants to get it done . Q Has there been any indication that this situation has changed ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : We 're going to continue to work on it . We 'll know when the votes are taken . Q George , last week you said that there are -- or various people in the administration were saying that you could n't go through Dole , you were going to have to try and go around him because he was immovable on this subject of a compromise , or at least the compromise he wanted was not anything like the one that you could accept . This week you 're talking to him . Is that because you 've realized that the peeling off effort was n't going to work ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : That 's because Senator Dole wanted to talk to the President about the stimulus package . Q He initiated the conversation ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Yes . Q Secretary Reich this morning said that , in fact , the President is not willing to compromise on this bill at all . You say he 's making -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I do n't know that that 's exactly what he said . I think he said he did n't have any indication that there was any compromises yet or that there would be a compromise , and the President does n't want to compromise . And the President does n't want to compromise . But if he has to make adjustments to get it through , he will . Q Officials here yesterday said that Panetta was working on a series of adjustments that might be made public before the actual vote . MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : It 's possible . Q Today ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I 'm not sure exactly when that will happen , but I think that it 's very possible that we 'll come forward with some sort of a different package , or Senate Democrats will come forward with some sort of a different package in order to get it passed . Q As we understood his conversations with Dole , the first one was some discussion of this and I 'll get back to you tonight with some details or some adjustments , or whatever the phrase is . Did he offer him some details or some adjustments ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I think it 's a question of how detailed . I mean , I think they had a general discussion about the package last night , subsequent to their conversation yesterday afternoon . I believe that there will be follow-up discussions today in the Senate , not necessarily between the President and Senator Dole . And let me just reiterate , neither side has made specific compromises at this date . When we have something we 'll let you know . And I 'm not suggesting that Senator Dole has accepted anything that we 've talked about or that we 've offered anything in a hard way . Q What are the follow-up discussions if not the President and Dole ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I think Senator Mitchell is going to talk to Senator Dole . Q Is that a threat ? ( Laughter . ) Q Did the President say to Senator Dole , all right , how about this number as an overall size , or did Dole say to the President , I can go as high as this ? Did they talk numbers ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I do n't think it was a negotiation in that respect . It was more of a discussion about their positions . Q Did they discuss actual numbers ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I 'm just not sure . I know they talked about the basic outlines of the packages . I think they talked about the programs they cared about . I do n't know if they got to the level of this many x-billion dollars . Q Does Dole have to sign off before there is a package ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : No , of course not . Q Did the White House have anything to do with the protesters who showed up in New Hampshire today where Senator Dole was speaking ? Was that in any way organized by -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Not to my knowledge , no . Q And has the President been in touch with Senators Kohl or Feingold ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I do n't think he 's talked to them , no . Q George , is the President considering the more palatable fact of having a national sales tax instead of having the haves having to continuously pay for the have-nots ? And is he going to scrap his proposed tax on the privileged few , with the haves having to pay for the have-nots ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : The President believes deeply that the tax rates on upper income Americans , as he presented in his budget , should go up . And I think for the second half of your question , I 'll refer you to my briefing from yesterday . Q George , on the subject of accuracy in information , you suggested the other day that the stimulus package included money that would solve the water problem in Milwaukee . Apparently that is not true . It 's actually waste water money . MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : It 's waste water money for Wisconsin , and some could go to Milwaukee . Q But it would not affect the drinking water problem because it 's waste water money , right ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : It would affect the water treatment overall . Q But the implication from your statement the other day was that it would help fix this disease problem in Milwaukee now . Would you agree that 's not the case ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I 'm not sure of the specifics . I know that it goes to the overall water treatment in Wisconsin . Q A leftover question from this morning , which was , when did the President find out that the task force was deliberating on a VAT ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I 'm not sure exactly when . I just do n't know . I assume it came up over the last -- certainly between the time that we had commented on in the past and two days ago . Q So sometime since March 25th ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I think that 's right . I do n't know the exact date . Q George , the President this morning mentioned that some labor and business groups are for the VAT tax . Apparently , the National Association of Manufacturers talks about perhaps the VAT tax being okay if it replaces the BTU tax . So does the President feel that perhaps this might be in place of some other tax he 's proposed , or is this totally in addition to the other taxes he 's already proposed ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I think we 've said all we have to say about the VAT at this point . I mean , there 's just no -- this is being considered by the health care working groups , and that is all . The President has n't made any further decisions beyond that . Q But it would be to finance health care , it would n't be to replace some other tax that finances -- it would n't replace the income tax , for instance ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : There have been no discussions on that . Q In terms of getting a VAT tax through Congress , Senator Dole 's press release today said VAT -- on tax day . Do you think -- does it have a chance of getting through Congress ? Would it have a chance ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I have no idea . Q Is that a consideration whether you all put it forward ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : That would become a consideration if the President were to decide to do it . It 's not in consideration now . Q You said at the beginning of the briefing that circumstances had changed and that had caused the VAT to now be under consideration . MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Yes , what the President referred to this morning . These groups came forward and said this is something that has to be considered . Q Those are the circumstances that have changed ? That 's the only difference between now and when he emphatically ruled it out that groups have asked it to be considered ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : That 's what he said . Q Is that true ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Yes . Q Was there , in fact , some understanding that sin taxes would not produce enough money for the health care benefits ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I 'm not going to get into the deliberations . Q But , George -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : No . What the consideration is , as the President said , groups came forward and said this is something you ought to consider . The working groups are looking at it . Q Is that the only thing that 's changed since his prior statement and your prior statement on the VAT ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Yes . Q Can you explain how those groups -- how that information got to him that groups wanted it ? Was it just reading the newspaper or did groups make presentations ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I think the groups -- as you know , the health care task force has met with dozens of groups . Q But this is the President 's knowledge that these groups had come forward . MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I think he was referring to what was coming to the working groups . Obviously , there have also been published positions in the newspapers . Q Have certain groups briefed him on the group 's presentations to them ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I do n't know if they 've briefed him -- I mean , how detailed the briefings have been . I know that the working groups decided to look into this after being pressed by these groups . Q What kind of arguments did the groups make that were persuasive enough that the President would change the position that he had enunciated previously ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I do n't know , it 's just they 've had longstanding positions that this would be a good way to finance health care . Q The President was n't aware of those longstanding positions ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : He may have been at some level . Obviously , he 's been a governor for a long time and he knows the basic arguments for and against a VAT tax . Q What we 're trying to figure out here -- you 're telling us that the only change , the only thing that affected this change in the President 's attitude toward the VAT between February and now -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : The President 's attitude has n't necessarily changed . I mean , he has not made a decision . Q I know , but the President said that it was off the table . So did you . And you 're saying that the only thing that 's changed is the positions of these groups , except you 're also describing them as longstanding positions . I do n't see the change . If these groups have n't had any change in their position that 's been made to the President -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Well , they 've made the presentations to the health care task force . Q There 's no relationship at all between the fact that sin taxes that he had said -- suggested in February that he favored will not produce enough revenue to finance -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I do n't think he ever suggested that they would produce all the revenue . Q Well , he suggested that he thought that those were appropriate ways to finance health care . MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : He did say that . I do n't know that he said anything to refute that . Q But , in fact , has the task force discovered that there would n't be enough revenue from those taxes to finance the kind of core benefits -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Again , I do n't think that the task force ever suggested that there would . Q George , if he advocated a VAT tax , would that break his promise not to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for his programs ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I ca n't comment on a hypothetical situation . Q But does that promise -- would that promise not to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for the programs prevent him from seeking a VAT tax ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : The President has made no decisions on the VAT tax . When he does , we 'll tell you and we 'll explain the implications then . Q Which specific groups can you cite -- business , labor or otherwise -- whose recommendations to the health care task force has prompted this consideration ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I do n't have the specific . I just do n't have that . Q George , can you tell us to what extend these other alternatives , for instance , the employer tax or the sin taxes or other financing options are also still on the table and what these options are ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : No , as members of the task force and representatives of the working groups have said , they are looking at a wide variety of options . I think that Ira Magaziner said that there are 20 different options under consideration . But I 'm not going to comment -- Q What 's the scope -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I 'm just not going to comment on them , no . Q What 's the scope of the need ? How much are you talking about that has to be produced by one or a combination of the -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : That 's what the health care task force is looking at . Q Since there 's not going to be any briefing on the Miyazawa visit , two questions : One , generally what does the President hope to use that meeting for , but more specifically , is his task complicated by the Japanese anger over the Vancouver note and the remark about market access at the press conference ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : The Vancouver note ? Q Does no mean yes . Q Yes and no . MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Well , I do n't know . I saw the Prime Minister 's press conference where he was asked the question about that note and he gave a very gracious and complete answer when he was asked the question . The questions of trade are something that certainly will be discussed between the Prime Minister and the President . There is obviously a trade imbalance between Japan and the U.S. that we want to do something about . Q Also in those comments the Prime Minister made he suggested that the United States should come down heavy on him in terms of trade . Are you going to oblige ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I think the President will state our views on trade very clearly and our views on the trade deficit very clearly . I do n't necessarily want to agree with your characterization of the Prime Minister 's comments . Q that we need specific export targets , specific numerical targets -- is that what he 's going to discuss with Miyazawa ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : They 're going to have a broad discussion of a wide range of trade issues . I do n't want to get into those specifics until after the meeting . Q Why ? Q That 's the crux of the issue , right ? Whether or not -- does the President believe that without specific numerical targets , it is really , as he said in his press conference , sort of hopeless that this is going to change very much ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : The President believes that we must have pressure on Japan to turn the trade imbalance around . I do not want to get into the specifics of how that would be done . Q But does the President believe that their stimulus package announced yesterday will rectify the imbalance ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I think , first , the President wants to get a full briefing on the stimulus package from Prime Minister Miyazawa himself , and then he 'll make the comment on it . Q How about the Russian aid package ? There seems to be some confusion about how the U.S. views that , Secretary Christopher saying -- or Bentsen saying the Japanese may need to do more , the Japanese saying that that 's not what they heard ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Again , we 're going to continue to work with all our allies in the G-7 , and we 're going to continue to press for help for Russian reform , Russian democratic reform . And I think that , so far , we had a very good announcement out of Tokyo and we 're going to continue to work with our allies for bilateral packages . Q Do you think the Japanese need to do more ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : We 're going to continue to work with all our allies to do as much as we can . Q Secretary Christopher was asked today on the Today Show this morning what he thought of Margaret Thatcher 's comments on the Bosnia policy . And he said , `` It 's a rather emotional response . '' MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Over an emotional issue . Q Right -- to an emotional problem . Does the White House condone that kind of remark ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I think that Secretary Christopher 's remarks speaks for itself . The President believes also that this is a deeply troubling situation that we 're trying to find answers for . Q But that specific -- `` rather emotional response '' -- specific term ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : No , it speaks for itself . Q In connection with that , does n't it seem that with the numbers of people who are being killed at this very moment , is it good American policy to put off some decisions that might be made now to help Boris Yeltsin win a referendum ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : For example ? Q To take stronger action , to take military action -- air strikes , anything that can be done ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : The President believes that what must be done now is to push harder for sanctions . He is also -- as you know , the administration has been discussing lifting the arms embargo . He believes those are the appropriate ways to increase pressure at this time . Q What is your response to the critics who would say that the U.S. is now stymied by trying to help Boris Yeltsin retain the presidency ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : They 're wrong . We 're pressing hard for the Serbs to come to the negotiating table . We 're pressing hard for increased sanctions , and we 're talking to our allies about the arms embargo . Q You were putting great store in Vance and Owen getting people to agree to that . Now , Vance and Owen have both said that military force to some extent would be acceptable . Does that change your thinking ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Clearly , we 're going to listen to whatever people who have put so much time into a situation have to say . But at this point , the President is moving forward on sanctions and talking about the arms embargo . Q A follow-up on a Dee Dee comment this morning . She said she would be able to provide some administration officials who could document the effect the sanctions are having in Bosnia . Are you going to be able to do that , or do you have anything -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I do n't think that 's what she said . Q That 's exactly what she said . MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I do n't think that 's true . But what she said -- we would look into the situation of what kind of evidence can be provided in Bosnia . Obviously , if there are connections between the Bosnian Serbs and the Serbs in Belgrade and we are tightening the screws on the Serbs in Belgrade , that will have an effect over time . I do not know day by day , minute by minute , what kind of help is being given between the two and what the exact effect has been . But , clearly , we are slowing the shipment of goods into Belgrade . We are having an effect on the Serbs there . What kind of effect that will eventually have on the Bosnian Serbs I do n't know . But one thing I would say is if it were having no effect at all , I do n't know why they 'd be fighting it so much . Q Are the First Lady 's tax returns going to be released ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I think there 's a joint tax return . And it will be probably later today . Q Is the President considering signing an executive order banning discrimination against homosexuals in the federal work force as part of the gay rights march here next week ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I do n't think there 's any proposal for that at this time , not that I know of . Q It 's something that the President promised during the campaign that he would do . MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I have not seen any -- I do n't think it 's anything that 's on his plate right now . Q Is he meeting with gay rights leaders at any point on this issue ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I do n't know about on this issue . I assume that he 'll meet with representatives of the gay and lesbian community sometime soon , as he meets with representatives of lots of different groups and communities . Q Do you know if that 's scheduled -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : It 's probably going to be tomorrow . Q Probably going to be tomorrow ? ( Laughter . ) Q It 's a good thing you asked . Q Who 's probably going to be there ? ( Laughter . ) MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I do n't know . Q How long -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I do n't know . That 's all I know . Q Do you know if it 's at 3:00 p.m. tomorrow ? ( Laughter . ) MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I do n't know what time it is . I do n't even know for sure if it 's going to be tomorrow . Q Environmental groups have asked him to make a major speech next week of some kind . Is that going to happen , do you know ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I do n't know if they 've asked , but I think the President has always planned , as he did last year , to give a speech on Earth Day and I expect that he will . If it 's not exactly on Earth Day , it might be a day before or something like that . Q Is he planning to sign or announce the signing of the biodiversity treaty in connection with Earth Day ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Again , I do n't know the specific timing of something like that , but it 's certainly something under discussion and something we 've been working on . Q Campaign finance reform ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : We 're working on it . Q Do you think it will be next week ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I 'm just not sure . Q The biodiversity treaty is something you 're working on ? I missed the question . MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Yes , something we 're working on . He asked if it was ready to be signed , and I said I did n't know anything about that but it 's something we 've certainly been working on . Q Do you know what organizations might be represented in this meeting with the gay and lesbian groups ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I do n't . Q Do you know if he is going to reconsider being out of town on the day of the march ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : He 's got to be at the Senate meeting in Jamestown , and I believe he 's also going to be giving a speech to the American Association of Newspaper Publishers in Boston on Sunday , as he did last year . Q Would you have told us if she had not pressed you on the question ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : On what ? Q On the gays . MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : When we went through the President 's schedule for the day , certainly . Q ? George , what day is the publisher 's speech ? Is that Sunday ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I think it 's a Sunday . Q And Saturday he 'll be in Jamestown ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Yes . Q So you 're just going to be in Jamestown for one day ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : No , I 'm not sure . I do n't know how long the Senate thing goes . It might go overnight . I just do n't know . Q You would have made the gay meeting public , right ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I 'm certain if we had the meeting -- I do n't know about open to the press , but we would have told you about it . Q I mean , because it is , as far as I can tell , the first time in history a President has met in the Oval Office with -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I did n't say it was going to be in the Oval Office . ( Laughter . ) But I did n't -- I 'm not say that it 's not , but I did n't say that it was . ( Laughter . ) Q at the White House in the Bush administration gay officials were invited to a bill signing ceremony and the White House had to repudiate having done that . So I just wanted to make sure -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Well , the President would n't do anything like that . Q Certainly not . Q What marching orders did the President give to General Vessey ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : They had a very good discussion for about half an hour today . He wanted -- the most important thing was he had a full accounting for American POWs and MIAs . He will obviously look into the circumstances surrounding this new document . The President stressed that he wanted the fullest possible accounting and said that only when we have that can we even consider any changes in our policy towards Vietnam . He 'll be looking at Vietnam 's response to the questions raised by the document and he 'll also look into investigations on discrepancy cases , increased efforts on remains , implementing trilateral investigations -- and access to military archives . And Ambassador Toon also briefed the President on the activities of the joint commission and on the document . Q Vietnam says it 's a fake . What is the DOD analysis at this stage ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : It 's not completed yet , and it 's also the first thing that General Vessey will bring up with the Vietnamese . Q A number of Defense officials have been saying that they think that the 600 or so prisoners referred to are , in fact , non-Americans that the Vietnamese had captured who they referred to as Americans from time to time . Do people -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : We do n't have any final determination . We 're going to wait for the complete review ; when we have it , we 'll make a judgment . Q I know you do n't have any final determination , but given all of the intense public interest in this , do you think that that 's a likely possibility ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I just do n't want to characterize it in any way until the review is complete . Q George , was there a topic scheduled for the speech in Boston ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : No . Q Is the President going to have a press conference tomorrow with Miyazawa ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I think so , but I 'm not positive . Yes , I expect , yes . Q Was Toon in with Vessey ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Yes . Q He was in on the meeting ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Yes . Q What was the question ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Was Ambassador Toon in with Vessey , and the answer is yes . Q Do you have any response to The Wall Street Journal report this morning the President 's distressed about some of his press clippings and that perhaps he 's distressed with you about that ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : No . Well , I do have a response . I think the article was highly misleading to the extent that it implied that the President has had restricted access to the press . I would point out that he 's answered 358 questions on 77 occasions , more than any of his predecessors . I would also point out it also -- Q How many questions ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Three hundred fifty-eight , on 77 occasions . Q How many were while he was jogging ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Well , no , that 's actually a very good question , Andrea . And I would point out further that the article also implied that these questions were only answered at tightly controlled photo opportunities , which is just patently false . He 's had 13 press conferences in either the East Room , the Oval Office or the Roosevelt Room or the Briefing Room , in addition to questions taken at photo opportunities , and that is only the -- Q Oval Office press conference -- when was that ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : He 's answered questions in the -- East Room . He 's had five in the East Room , he 's had one in the Oval Office , he 's had one in the Rose Garden , he 's had one or two in the Roosevelt Room . And this is just to the White House , Washington Press Corps . In addition to that , he 's had 17 interviews with local television anchors . He 's met with the editorial board of The Portland Oregonian . He 's had an hour-long interview with Dan Rather . He 's had interviews with local press from California , Florida and Connecticut -- Q Can you address the question of the attitude ? The article implies that he does n't -- Q Why does n't he like us ? ( Laughter . ) Q Did you really get blamed for that Post story ? Q The story is that you -- are you held responsible for it . MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I do n't think I 'm going to comment about this . Q Are you denying that the President has shown displeasure publicly ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I am not commenting on the discussions between the President and myself . Q Did the President write that letter to Chris Webber ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : What ? Q The letter to the University of Michigan basketball player ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Oh , yes . Q That is an authentic letter ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Yes . Q Since the President first talked about the VAT in February , he said at the time that he thought there probably should be exceptions made in basic necessities such as food and clothing . Does he still hold that position given the impact it could have ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Again , I just ca n't comment on a proposal he has n't made . Q George , does the President have some agenda for this meeting with the gay leaders tomorrow ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Well , I think it will just a general meeting on the wide range of issues that they care about including AIDS and other issues -- civil rights . Q The military issue ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I 'm certain it will come up . Q Is he using this event to name the AIDS -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I do n't think so . Q George , what specifically is the President doing to prepare for tomorrow 's meeting with the Prime Minister Miyazawa ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : He 's had briefing memos . He 's had general discussions with members of the Treasury Department , the Trade Representative and others . Q report yet ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I do n't know if he has the report referred to in The Times , but Ambassador Kantor was here to brief him today . Q He was ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Yes . Q Does he intend to use any of these instances that -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Again , I do n't know that the report 's been presented . But obviously , the President will press hard in any case where he thinks that a violation has occurred . Q In terms of the Wall Street Journal , the thrust was that there 's a real schism here -- a hostility . Do you think he feels that way ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Not at all . As I said on the record in the article , I think the President likes reporters . Again , I think that the thrust of the article was still misleading . The thrust of the article was that in some way , some attitude which the President may or may not have is affecting access when , in fact , he has the most open , accessible administration than have any in recent history . Q Can we come up to your office ? ( Laughter . ) MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : If you 're invited . THE PRESS : Thank you . END 1:34 P.M. EDT # 57-04/15

At the end of the errors section , there are the following references for tutorials on X programming style . They are : Rosenthal , David - A simple X11 client program Proceedings of the Winter 1988 Usenix Conference , 1988 . Lemke , D. , and Rosenthal , D. - Visualizing X11 clients Proceedings of the Winter 1989 Usenix Conference , 1989 . Does anyone know where I could find these in printed or ( preferably ) electronic form ? Or can you suggest any net resources devoted to the introduction to programming X ( I 'll be looking at the bookstore for books , so I am really only asking about what I can find on the net . ) Thanks , David Simpson davesimp @ soda.berkeley.edu
From : keith @ orion.ic.cmc.ca ( Keith de Solla ) Subject : CDN gun laws Organization : Canadian Microelectronics Corporation Lines : 37 [ MODERATOR : Nice summary , Keith , thanks . ] I talked to the federal Dept . of Justice ( DOJ , Ottawa ) to try and clarify a bunch of things regarding changes to Canadian gun laws . I am posting here for informational purposes ; questions to email , followup to t.p.g . 1 . It is still technically feasible ( but almost impossible ) to get a concealed carry permit in Canada . This is contrary to what I was told by a police officer . 2 . It is still legal to use lethal force ( such as a firearm ) to protect life , also contrary to what the officer told me . Guns must be stored locked up and unloaded , however . 3 . Regarding hi-capacity magazines , it is still not clear who will be exempt or how this will be managed . This is up to each province . The general idea is that exempt persons will receive a letter/form authorizing them to possess the high capacity magazines . Apparently , the authorization is to specify how many of these 'prohibited weapons ' you will be allowed to possess . Dealers will be allowed to order high capacity mags for those allowed to possess them , but will not be allowed to stock them . 4 . High capacity magazines converted to comply with the new limits will not be considered prohibited weapons . Amendments to the regulations specify some possible methods to alter the magazines . Some manufacturers ( Beretta ) will be marketing reduced capacity magazines . ( God knows how much they 'll charge for these ) This covers most of what we discussed . I have typed this from memory , do not take it as gospel .

From : guykuo @ carson.u.washington.edu ( Guy Kuo ) Subject : Re : iisi clock upgrades Organization : University of Washington Lines : 8 NNTP-Posting-Host : carson.u.washington.edu I have read one report of a brave soul who rewired the 40 mhz clock and a higher speed clock oscillator 's outputs through a double throw switch to allow different speeds . There was no mention of any attempts to switch speeds on the fly but if the SI uses timing loops anything like a Quadra for accessing its floppy drive , dynamic switching will wreak havoc . A Quadra must reboot after having its clock speed significantly changed or it will be unable to properly access its floppy drive .

Some software others hardware orientated.. ( Probably the wrong newsgroup ... . as everyone claims.. ) Anyway.. 1 ) Does any one happen to have the board jumper details for a Trident 8900 SVGA graphics card ( 1MB ) or even what the dip switches do on the end.. Mine already works fine ( albeit slow ) and after having blown up a monitor I found out which switch controlled the interlace/non interlace facility.. But I 'm curious as to why there are 8 dip switches on the card with apparantly little use.. 2 ) Secondly , does anyone know why Commodore had to be so crazed in their design of the PC-40 motherboard with respect to the RAM.. ( IE 512 + 512 or 640 +0K ) ? ? 3 ) Can anyone supply pin details for the expansion ports for a pc ( 8 or 16 bit ) .. or even a sample circuit to cause an irq when a button is pressed ... ( Yeah I know its a piece of cake.. I 'm lazy 8 ) 4 ) Software wise.. Anyone care to divulge some tips on accessing expanded RAM on a PC ( from a program written in Turbo C++ ) ... . For instance , using farcoreleft ( ) and coreleft ( ) return only memory available from the base 640K regardless of combinations of EMM386 etc etc ... What I want is to be able to use the RAM above and beyond the 1MB boundary ... I 'm not certain whether farmalloc / new actually uses it anyway but I 'll suspect not .. 5 ) Also.. what half brained wit created DOS so as not to be re-entrant ? ? ? ? ? ? As a follow on , does anyone have any comments about the use of DOS calls 0 to 0C from within a DOS interrupt ? Ie will changing the stack size on entry be of use.. Two articles I 've read on the subject have given conflicting views ... Does anyone have any views on writing direct to screen memory in terms of portability ? Many thanks.. Got ta go , bars closing soon 8 ) Cheers Ian

I agree that Arab news sources are also inherently biased . But I believe the statement I was reacting to was that since the american accounts of events are not fully like the Israeli accounts , the Americans are biased . I just thought that the Israelis had more motivation for bias . The UN has tried many times to condemn Israel for its gross violation of human rights . However the US has vetoed most such attempts . It is interesting to note that the U.S. is often the only country opposing such condemnation ( well the U.S. and Israel ) . It is also interesting to note that that means other western countries realize these human rights violations . So maybe there are human rights violations going on after all .

In short : The ticket was for not stopping at a stop sign . Given the conditions I could not stop in time and decided instead of sliding right through the intersection , I would complete my right-turn and avoid a possible accident . A police cruiser happened to be approaching the intersection from my left and gave me the ticket . The officer said `` The only reason that you even slowed down in the first place was that you saw me approaching , otherwise you would have bombed right through '' I would like to thank all those who responded favorably to my request for help . To all of those who told me to bite the bullet and pay the fine : PHGHGHGHGH.. The judge sided with me and decided that in this case `` Not stopping '' was the safest thing to do and found me NOT GUILTY . The officer 's statement and my account of the conditions at the time ( very slippery , backed by newpaper weather conditions ) were the factors what made the judge decide on his verdict .

Overrun and retry errors abound , even when the only active application is the datacomm or FAX program . If the transfer completes at all , it may take even longer than with the old 2400bps modem . There are three reasons for the problem : 1 . The Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitters ( UARTs ) used in most PCs are primitive Ns8250 devices with single-byte FIFO buffers . If the operating system/driver can not read and flush each character at high interrupt rates , the next incoming character overwrites the FIFO and the previous one is lost . DOS , being a fairly single-minded environment during datacomm , can usually keep up . Windows ca n't . 2 . Windows has more operating system overhead than plain DOS , and interrupts often take longer to service . Overruns are much more likely than under DOS . As soon as you report to your PC/modem vendor that you are losing data , you may be advised that `` you need to upgrade to a 16550 '' . More likely , since there seems to be a conspiracy of ignorance about this issue , you 'll get no useful advice at all . Most of the store-front and mail-order sources I spoke with in attempting to solve my own problem had never heard the term `` 16550 '' and many did n't even know what a UART was . 3 . Even your PC has Ns16550A UARTs ( and PS/2 's do ) , or if you can upgrade your mother/COM board or add a new COM board , you may STILL experience errors and overruns because the standard MicroSoft Windows COM drivers do n't take full advantage of the 16550 . Windows 3.1 is improved in this regard over 3.0 , but I still recommend a driver upgrade . Applications like ProComm+/Win ( which is what I use ) can not get around this problem by themselves . If you have a modem CARD , you may not have a problem , as the modem part of the card can be designed to be aware of the state of the UART , and avoid overrunning it ; however , I would n't want to bet that the card designers were that clever , and will insist on a 16550 UART if I ever buy a modem card . Some modem cards do n't even have conventional UARTs , but if they are to work with standard Windows drivers , they need to simulate one . Use MSD.EXE ( below ) to see what the modem card is , or is pretending to be . The Hardware Situation . The UARTs on most PC COM ports are based on National Semiconductor Ns8250 or Ns16450 chips ( or megacells inside VLSI chips where you ca n't replace them ) . You can ID the UART type on your system by running the MicroSoft diagnostic program \WINDOWS\MSD.EXE . Be sure to run it in DOS *before* bringing up Windows . The Windows serial API may prevent MSD from accurately identifying a 16550 if you run it from a Windows DOS prompt . The Ns16550 UART has separate 16-byte transmit and receive FIFOs with configurable trigger levels , and can run reliably at clock rates up to 460,800 bps , although with current modem technology , there 's no point in pushing your luck by going over 115,200 bps . The 16550 has shorted access cycle times than the 16450 or 8250 . The 16550 also has DMA capability , but it is not clear that any PC drivers ever use this . For more technical info , see National Semiconductor Application Note AN-491 . So , what UART component do you have ? Try to locate the UART on your mother board , multi-function I/O card , COM board or ISA/MCA modem card . If you ca n't find a socketed component with the numbers `` 8250 '' or `` 16450 '' , your COM ports are probably buried in VLSI , and you wo n't be able to perform a chip replacement . If you can DISABLE your VLSI COM ports ( as I chose to do ) , you can at least add an aftermarket COM board . If you have one or more socketed 8250 or 16450 chips , you can buy plug-in Ns16550AFN or PC16C550CN ( low power CMOS version ) ICs from several suppliers typically for $ 9 to $ 15 each . The `` N '' chip is the normal 40-pin dual-in-line package . Other styles are available , but avoid any Ns16550 chips without the `` A '' ( the 16C550C are presumably all OK ) . Early Ns chips have bugs , although National will reportedly exchange those of their own manufacture for free . Clone chips are available from various IC makers other than National . The manual for the TurboCom drivers states support for the following ( apparently equivalent ) chips : National Semiconductor : 16550A , 16551 , 16552 Chips & Technology : 82C607 Texas Instruments : t16c550a Silicon Systems : 73M550 VLSI 16C550 TurboCom warns about the pre- '' A '' Ns16550 and Western Digital 16C550 , says that problems have been reported with early IBM PS/2 55SX and 70 systems ( IBM reportedly will upgrade them ) . If you DO N'T have socketed 8250/16450 chips , you 'll need to buy an after- market COM or multi-function board . If this is a modem card situation , you may be hosed . To add a new COM or multi-function card , you 'll need to either disable the COM1/2 port ( s ) you are replacing , or re-assign them to COM3/4 ( although watch out for IRQ conflicts without TurboCom ) . Although cheaper cards are available , in the interest of getting the problem solved quickly I elected buy the Modular Circuit Technology MCT-AIO+ card from : JDR Microdevices 2233 Samaritan Drive San Jose CA 95124 ( 800 ) 538-5000 voice US ( 408 ) 559-1200 voice other ( 800 ) 538-5005 FAX US The MCT-AIO+ ( and the `` + '' is important ) sells for $ 89.95 .

Meanwhile , back at the MCT card from JDR ... I only needed two serial ports , and am running out of IRQs on my PC , so I disabled my built-in VLSI-based 8250 ports . However , with the TurboCom driver ( below ) , I could have set the internals as COM3 and 4 , using IRQ sharing . The Software Situation Simply upgrading to 16550 UARTs will not completely solve common overrun problems . The standard MS serial drivers do n't take full advantage of the 16550 . The Windows 3.0 drivers are even less capable , and the Windows 3.1 drivers have the following limitations : - They enable only the receive FIFO , and only at rates above 2400 bps . - They never enable the transmit FIFO , which results in an interrupt rate of 10x during uploads . - They set the trigger level at 14 bytes ( too high - it 's easy for 2 more bytes to arrive before the driver can read the FIFO ) . - The Ports menu of the Control Panel only allows speeds up to 19200 . With a V.32bis modem , sparse data and text can easily compress 3:1 or more , suggesting that a host DTE connect rate of 57,600 bps would be effective . - The API wo n't accept rates above `` CBR_128000 '' . - The API wo n't let DOS programs know there is a 16550 there , and even if it did , DOS programs that are n't 16550-aware get little benefit from a 16550 port with the standard drivers . - They do n't allow IRQ sharing for COM3,4 . - The BIOS does n't initialize COM3,4 properly in many systems . - Windows provides no workaround for apps that do n't provide port speed options above 19200 bps . These problems are reportedly NOT solved in Windows NT or DOS 6.0 , and may or may not be addressed in any Windows releases after 3.1 ( but before 4.0 ) . Rumors suggest they `` may '' be solved in Windows `` 4.0 '' . You can get replacement drivers that solve all of those problems by buying a copy of `` TurboCom '' , current version 1.2 , from : Bio-Engineering Research Pacific CommWare Division 180 Beacon Hill Lane Ashland OR 97520-9701 ( 503 ) 482-2744 voice ( 503 ) 482-2627 FAX ( 503 ) 482-2633 BBS MCImail : 344-5374 CompuServe : 71521,760 Price was around $ 50 as I recall . Bio-Eng is not set up to accept credit cards , so I had to send a check . Egghead and 1-800-Software list TurboCom but as far as I know , they do n't stock it . Bio is not a software company per se . They apparently needed reliable hi-speed serial connections for an in-house instrument application , wrote their own driver , discovered a market for it , revised it to be a general purpose COM driver suite . They recently upgraded it for Windows 3.1 . It is run-time licensed . I now have my host ( DTE ) connect rate set to 57,600 bps most of my datacomm apps , and I am having ZERO problems with downloads . I routinely see transfer rates that exceed 2,000 bps . I am also using 115,200 bps when linking an HP95LX to my PC , with lossless bi-directional I/O . Uploads to various remote systems are another matter , because many hosts are still using antique UARTs and drivers . Note that 19200 is still the highest rate that the Windows 3.1 Port menu in Control Panel will allow in configuring a COM port . TurboCom gets around this by allowing you to specify , on each port , a factor that will set the real UART rate to a multiple of the rate passed through the Windows APIs and dialog boxes . I also have CTS/RTS hardware flow control enabled , and I suggest that you do the same . Even if you only ever transfer 7-bit ASCII data , Xon/XOff is not a sufficiently reliable method of flow control . The informal ( DEC ) standard for Xon/Xoff hysteresis is that the sender may transmit another 16 ( yes , sixteen ) bytes after receipt of the Xoff from the receiving system or device . The 16 byte FIFO in the 16550 is clearly not big enough to let us rely exclusively on Xon/Xoff . A well-respected datacomm engineer has informed me that the 16550 's ca n't really do CTS/RTS all by itself in the DOS/Windows environment , so using data rates above 115,200 may still be risky . Even with hardware flow control , a 16550 with TurboCom can still experience overruns in very busy systems , with lots of apps running and serious swapping in progress . If this is your situation , you may need to buy a co-processed COM board , but this will cost you more than a 16550/TurboCom upgrade . A review of two such boards , and a review of TurboCom , can be found in the Feb'93 issue of `` Windows Sources '' magazine . I suggest trying a 16550/TurboCom upgrade first , and experiment with process priorities and time slices if you are a `` power user '' whose thrashing system still runs into comm problems . Closing Soapbox Comments The state of RS-232C serial datacomm support is an embarrassment across the computer industry . Because it is the oldest standard I/O interface , the job of designing hardware and writing software often seems to be assigned to the least senior or lowest ranked engineers at computer companies . The design of the average serial port is at least ten years behind the state of the art . In my last job , with a major workstation vendor , I lobbied for improved serial ports when they were doing the initial designs of a new system . That family of machines was subsequently introduced with 16550 ports . However , this is the exception . Few computer companies seem to have any champions for decent I/O . You may as well learn what you can about serial I/O , because this situation shows no sign of improving soon . When V.FAST arrives , I expect cries of outrage from Windows users world-wide whose 8250 PCs `` sort of '' work today with V.32 , but will fail miserably with V.FAST . Without a hardware-buffered UART ( like the 16550 ) and without software drivers that use that UART to best advantage , a V.FAST modem will be a waste of money .

That torque , and an upright riding position is better than a slightly or radically forward riding position combined with a high-rpm low torque motor . To a cruiser-motorcyclist , chrome has some importance . To sport-bike motorcyclists chrome has very little impact on buying choice . Unless motivated solely by price , these are the criteria each rider uses to select the vehicle of choice . To ignore these , as well as other criteria , would be insensitive . In other words , no one motorcycle can fufill the requirements that a sport-bike rider and a cruiser rider may have . ( sometimes it 's hard for *any* motorcycle to fufill a person 's requirements ) You 're fishing for flames , Dave .

From : szabo @ techbook.com ( Nick Szabo ) Subject : SSF Redesign : Constellation Summary : decentralize & automate functions Keywords : space station , constellation Article-I.D . : techbook.C51z6E.CL1 Organization : TECHbooks -- - Public Access UNIX -- - ( 503 ) 220-0636 Lines : 89 SSF is up for redesign again . Let 's do it right this time ! Let 's step back and consider the functionality we want : [ 1 ] microgravity/vacuum process research [ 2 ] life sciences research ( adaptation to space ) [ 3 ] spacecraft maintenence The old NASA approach , explified by Shuttle and SSF so far , was to centralize functionality . These projects failed to meet their targets by a wide margin : the military and commercial users took most of their payloads off Shuttle after wasting much effort to tie their payloads to it , and SSF has crumbled into disorganization and miscommunication . Over $ 50 billion has been spent on these two projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvement in commercial space industrialization . Meanwhile , military and commercial users have come up with a superior strategy for space development : the constellation . Firstly , different functions are broken down into different constellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function : thus we have the GPS/Navstar constellation in 12-hour orbits , comsats in Clarke and Molniya orbits , etc . Secondly , the task is distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation , providing for redundancy and full coverage where needed . SSF 's 3 main functions require quite different environments and are also prime candidates for constellization . [ 1 ] We have the makings of a microgravity constellation now : COMET and Mir for long-duration flights , Shuttle/Spacelab for short-duration flights . The best strategy for this area is inexpensive , incremental improvement : installation of U.S. facilities on Mir , Shuttle/Mir linkup , and transition from Shuttle/Spacelab to a much less expensive SSTO/Spacehab/COMET or SSTO/SIF/COMET . We might also expand the research program to take advantage of interesting space environments , eg the high-radiation Van Allen belt or gas/plasma gradients in comet tails . The COMET system can be much more easily retrofitted for these tasks , where a station is too large to affordably launch beyond LEO . [ 2 ] We need to study life sciences not just in microgravity , but also in lunar and Martian gravities , and in the radiation environments of deep space instead of the protected shelter of LEO . This is a very long-term , low-priority project , since astronauts will have little practical use in the space program until costs come down orders of magnitude . Furthermore , using astronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation , and the sample size . So I propose LabRatSat , a constellation tether-bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravity in super-Van-Allen-Belt orbits that are representative of the radiation environment encountered on Earth-Moon , Earth-Mars , Earth-asteroid , etc . trips . The miniaturized life support machinery might be operated real-time from earth thru a VR interface . AFter several orbital missions have been flown , follow-ons can act as LDEFs on the lunar and Martian surface , testing out the actual environment at low cost before $ billions are spent on astronauts . [ 3 ] By far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in Clarke orbit . I propose a fleet of small teleoperated robots and small test satellites on which ground engineers can practice their skills . Once in place , robots can pry stuck solar arrays and antennas , attach solar battery power packs , inject fuel , etc . Once the fleet is working , it can be spun off to commercial company ( s ) who can work with the comsat companies to develop comsat replaceable module standards . By applying the successful constellation strategy , and getting rid of the failed centralized strategy of STS and old SSF , we have radically improved the capability of the program while greatly cutting its cost . For a fraction of SSF 's pricetag , we can fix satellites where the satellites are , we can study life 's adaptation to a much large & more representative variety of space environments , and we can do microgravity and vacuum research inexpensively and , if needed , in special-purpose orbits . N.B. , we can apply the constellation strategy to space exploration as well , greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality . Mars Network and Artemis are two good examples of this ; more ambitiously we can set up a network of native propellant plants on Mars that can be used to fuel planet-wide rover/ballistic hopper prospecting and sample return . The descendants of LabRatSat 's technology can be used as a Mars surface LDEF and to test out closed-ecology greenhouses on Mars at low cost . -- Nick Szabo szabo @ techboook.com

Unfortunately , I was unable to post it before the date of this month 's meeting . I 'm posting it anyway , and posting it world-wide instead of regional , in the hopes that some of the information may be useful or illustrative . Also , I hope it can be used as an example and inspiration for the posting of other newsletters and data related to organ transplantation and donation . Mike Transplant Recipients International Organization Long Island Chapter P.O . Box 922 Huntington , NY 11743-0922 NEWSLETTER 516/421-3258 APRIL 1993 VOLUME IV No . 8 NEXT MEETING The next meeting is WEDNESDAY APRIL 14 at 8 pm at the Knights of Columbus Emerald Manor , 517 Uniondale Avenue in Uniondale . Our guest speaker will be Dr. Lewis Teperman . Dr. Teperman trained in Pittsburgh under Dr. Starzl and is now the Assistant Director of the Liver Transplant Program at New York University Medical Center . Dr. Teperman will discuss current trends in transplantation and treatment and will answer questions . He is a long time friend of TRIO , surgeon to many of our members , and always a gracious and delightful guest . It is sure to be a very informative , interesting and engaging evening . Our hospitality committee , Bette and Vito Suglia and Jim Spence will be well prepared , and at last the weather should be cooperative . We hope to see a very large gathering to welcome Dr. Teperman . WEDNESDAY APRIL 14 K of C UNIONDALE LAST MEETING It has been noted here before that the Long Island Chapter of TRIO has extraordinary power in predicting bad weather , being able to forecast rain , sleet and snow fully a month in advance . No TV weatherman can match us . This time we not only scored again , but we were also able to disable the Long Island Railroad , making travel REALLY difficult . None the less , many braved the snow and we had an interesting meeting and good conversation . Our scheduled speaker , Mrs. Elizabeth Linnehan , a professional nutritionist , had a family emergency and was not able to attend . She hope she will be with us in the fall to discuss diet and medications . However , Ms. Jennifer Friedman , an image consultant and sister of a liver transplant recipient was kind enough to step in on very short notice . Ms. Friedman gave us a lot of good advice about choosing clothes and makeup , ( even a bit for men ) to help us look well and healthy and to minimize some of the cosmetic effects of some of the medicine and drugs we take . We are most grateful to Jennifer and thank her for an entertaining evening . ANNUAL MEETING In addition to welcoming Dr. Teperman , the April meeting is also the Annual meeting of the Chapter . This is the official notice of the meeting as required by our By-Laws . The main purpose of the meeting is to review the past year , solicit member views and ideas for better ways to meet their needs , and to elect members of the Board of Directors for the coming two year term . The nominating committee has prepared the following slate for the Board . Anne ( Liver Recipient ) and Don Treffeisen Robert ( Heart Recipient ) and Eulene Smith Vito ( Kidney Recipient ) and Bette Suglia Kay Grenzig ( Liver Recipient ) Jan Schichtel ( Kidney Recipient ) Larry Juliano ( Kidney Recipient ) David Bekofsky ( Director Public Education LITP ) Those remaining on the Board for another year are : Robert Carroll ( Liver , Kidney & Pancreas Recipient ) Jerry ( Kidney Recipient ) and Jeanne Eichhorn Ron ( Kidney Donor ) and Marie Healy Peter Smith ( Bone Marrow Recipient ) Patricia Ann Yankus ( Kidney and Pancreas Recipient ) Walter Ruzak ( Kidney Recipient ) This may seem to be a big Board , but many hands make light work and with our various medical uncertainties , it is good to have backups for all the jobs on the Board . Therefore , in addition to the slate being presented for voting , nominations will also be accepted from the floor . There is no set number of Board members and there is plenty of work . In addition , brief treasurer 's and membership reports will be given and the floor will be open for any new business , suggestions , or comments anyone would like to bring up . We will keep the formal meeting short so that we can spend the majority of the time with Dr. Teperman . FUTURE MEETINGS Remember the scheduled guests for the rest of the year . May 12 Dr. Peter Shaprio , Chief of Psychiatry Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center June 9 Dr. Felix Rappaport , Director of the Stony Brook Kidney Transplant Program . Plan on being with us the second Wednesday of each month . NOTDAW The week of April 18-24 is National Organ and Tissue Donor Awareness Week . NOTDAW . While we are planning news releases , speaking engagements and meetings with Supervisors Gullata and Gaffney , we have decided not to have our softball game because of two year 's experience with miserable weather . We all can help spread the word on donor awareness , however . We have found it effective to ask your pastor , or rabbi to publish a letter or announcement in the parish bulletin , allow you to address the congregation , or include mention of the gift of life in his sermon . Attached to this Newsletter is a sample letter and fact sheet you can use . Thank you . DR. STARZL TO BE HONORED The Long Island Chapter of the American Liver Foundation will hold its annual Auction and Dinner Dance on May 7th at the Fountainbleu on Jericho Turnpike in Jericho . Dr. Thomas Starzl will be the honored guest . Tickets are $ 50 person and are going fast . If you 'd like to meet Dr. Starzl , call Anne Treffeisen at ( 516 ) 421-3258 for details . MEMBERSHIP NEWS Congratulations to Al Reese . Al received his heart transplant in Pittsburgh after waiting 3 1/2 years . He is home and doing well after only 12 days in hospital . Arthur Michaels , liver recipient , is planning to run the Boston Marathon in April . What fantastic proof that transplantation works ! We hope the national press notices . Bob McCormack , after a persistent bout with infection , had his transplanted kidney removed . He is home now , back on dialysis and feeling better . Nicole Healy , kidney recipient and daughter of Ron and Marie , spent the past several weeks in hospital in Miami with problems encountered on vacation . Marie has been with her in Florida . They are back in New York where Nicole 's treatment will continue . We wish Nicole a speedy recovery . Kay Grenzig , liver recipient , is mending now after a bad fall that resulted in a broken arm and a broken leg . Kay is a candidate for the Board so we need her well soon . And best wishes to all coming out of the flu . It was a tough winter for many , but the tulips are just under the snow . SEE YOU ... ... WEDNESDAY APRIL 14 8 PM K of C UNIONDALE DR. LEWIS TEPERMAN

Article-I.D . : hydra.91513 Distribution : usa Organization : Georgia Institute of Technology Lines : 39 Let 's look at the effects of inflation on 1930 's superstars ' salaries . I read once that the Babe made $ 80,000 one year and that was about as good as it got for him . Let 's assume he made that in 1928 ( I 'm not sure of the figures , but I know I 'm in the ballpark -- pun intended ) . : - ) Today , assuming a 4 % yearly inflation rate , which is an understatement if not accurate , his measly $ 80,000 salary would be worth . FV = $ 80,000 x ( 1+4 % ) ^ ( 1993-1928 ) = $ 80,000 x ( 1.04 ) ^65 = just over $ 1,000,000 . Assuming inflation is average of around 5 % . FV = $ 80,000 x ( 1+5 % ) ^65 = almost 2,000,000 . ( I did n't crunch these numbers beforehand ) . These numbers might lead one to believe that today 's players are slightly overpaid . The Babe appears to have made then what today 's average to above average players make now . Perfectly accurate salary , year of salary , and average inflation rate would make this analysis more accurate , but I don ` t think I 'm off by much .

Completely smooth . Not that it runs poorly normally , but on these days , it is exceptional . My theory is that the air density and moisture content of the air are such that I get complete combustion . Needless to say , it puts me in a great mood . The mood lasted for about 20 miles . Heading north on the 405 freeway , about a mile or two south of the 10 , my throttle stopped responding ... . and I was between lanes . Nothing to do but make my way over 4 lanes to the shoulder ... initially by gliding , then by pushing . At least traffic was heavy enough so that cars did not mind stopping for me . Turned out to be a screw unscrewed inside my Mikuni HS40 carb . I keep hearing that one should keep all of the screws tight on a bike , but I never thought that I had to do that on the screws inside of a carb .

I can't > believe these media fools picking them to win the division ( like our > Tom Gage of the Detroit News claiming Herk Robinson is some kind of > genius for the trades/aquisitions he 's made ) Would you say the same thing about the Dodgers in '65 or '66 ? True , Cone is probably as good as Drysdale , and they have no Koufax , but still , these teams were winning with home run leaders who had very bad totals , with lots of low-scoring games , etc . And they did n't use relievers , whereas Jeff Montgomery is having a super season for them . That being said , I still picked them 5th or so , but I think a superb pitching team can win if they have enough hitting . There 's more of a chance of that , I think , than of a team with tremendous hitting but no pitching . At least , to me . I wonder , though - which one do you people think would do better - a team with Johnson , Koufax in his prime , Seaver , Carlton , and Young , in no real order , as the starters , with Sutter , Fingers , and Lyle in the bullpen , but with a puny offense ( assuming good defense , like Mazeroski , Maranville , etc . ) Or a team with poor pitching , but with an offense of Cobb , Carew , Ruth , Gehrig , Mays , Schmidt , Wagner , and Bench - again , you pick the order . I would postulate that the pitching one would be several games better by seasons ' end . Even the best hitters can succeed only 2/5 of the time in their best years , but a great pitcher can throw lots of shutouts - taking all the players in their prime , they might throw 50 shutouts in a year . And all the offense would have to do is get 1 run across . I wonder if someone with Stratomatic or something could plug such all- time teams into a regular season , have it played , and report the results I would love to see that . -- Doug Fowler : dxf12 @ po.CWRU.edu : Me , age 4 & now : `` Mommys and Daddys & other Ever wonder if , after Casey : relatives have to give lots of hugs & love missed the 3rd strike in the poem : & support , 'cause Heaven is just a great he ran to first and made it ? : big hug that lasts forever and ever ! ! !

Keywords : brady handguns s414 hr1025 hr277 instant check waiting period Organization : NETCOM On-line Communication Services ( 408 241-9760 guest ) Distribution : na Lines : 40 Hi . I 've just finished reading S414 , and have several questions about the Brady bills ( S414 and HR1025 ) . 1 . _Are_ these the current versions of the Brady bill ? What is the status of these bills ? I 've heard they 're `` in committee '' . How close is that to being made law ? 2 . S414 and HR1025 seem fairly similar . Are there any important differences I missed ? 3 . S414 seems to have some serious loopholes : A. S414 does n't specify an `` appeals '' process to wrongful denial during the waiting period , other than a civil lawsuit ( ? ) ( S414 has an appeals process once the required instant background check system is established , but not before ) . B. the police are explicitly NOT liable for mistakes in denying/approving using existing records ( so who would I sue in `` A '' above to have an inaccurate record corrected ? ) C. S414 includes an exception-to-waiting-period clause for if a person can convince the local Chief Law-Enforcement Officer ( CLEO ) of an immediate threat to his or her life , or life of a household member . But S414 does n't say exactly what is considered a `` threat '' , nor does it place a limit on how long the CLEO takes to issue an exception statement . True ? Have I misunderstood ? Any other 'holes ? 4 . With just S414 , what 's to stop a person with a `` clean '' record from buying guns , grinding off the serial numbers , and selling them to crooks ? At minimum , what additional laws are needed to prevent this ? 'Seems at min . a `` gun counting '' scheme would be needed ( e.g. , `` John Doe owns N guns '' ) . So , if S414 passes , I would n't be surprised to see legislation for stricter , harder-to-forge I.D . 's plus national gun registration , justified by a need to make the Brady bill work . Please comment . I 'm mainly interested in specific problems with the current legislation -- I do n't mean to start a general discussion of the merits of any/all waiting-period bills ever proposed .

From : afielden @ cbnewsb.cb.att.com ( andrew.j.fielden ) Subject : X interactive performance Keywords : benchmark Organization : AT & T Lines : 21 We recently got an NCD X-terminal to evaluate . This is running XRemote over a serial line . I wanted to get some measurement of response time , so I wrote a small Xlib program which simply creates a window , maps it and sends the first Expose event to itself . The program times the delay from sending the event , to receiving it . I thought this was the simplest way to test client/X-server round-trip delays . It 's a similar concept to the ping ( 8C ) program . Is this a valid test to perform ? I 've also tried the xbench program , available from ftp.uu.net , which bombards the server with graphics operations , but I just wanted to get a quantative measure of what is `` acceptable '' interactive response time .

From : kennejs @ a.cs.okstate.edu ( KENNEDY JAMES SCOT ) Subject : We 're winning the war on drugs . Not ! Organization : Oklahoma State University , Computer Science , Stillwater Keywords : drugs DEA WOD legalization Lines : 140 The DEA and other organizations would have the American people believe that we are winning the `` war on drugs '' . I 'm going to dispel the propaganda that the DEA is putting out by showing you the drug war 's *real* status . To help prove my assertions I 've also posted two articles from USA Today that clearly demonstrate that drug use among certain age groups *is* on the rise . If WOD is working , as we 're led to believe , then drug abuse should have gone down substantially by now . The reality is , is that it has not gone down very much . If anything , substance abuse is on the rise . I 'm also going to supply a possible solution to this problem . The following text is an excerpt from an article about rock music and pot entitled `` Hello Again , Mary Jane '' which appears in the current issue of Time magazine ( April 19 , 1993 , p. 59 ) . Law-enforcement officials say pot advocates are just blowing smoke when they talk about the comeback of the weed . `` Perhaps because of the change of administrations , the marijuana lobby is out in full force , '' says Robert Bonner , head of the Drug Enforcement Administration . `` The fact is , they 're losing the battle . '' In 1985 more than 23 % of youths ages 12 to 17 said they smoked marijuana ; in 1991 that figure was 13 % , and Bonner says it is still falling . Bonner also offers a reminder that studies confirm such marijuana health risks as destruction of nerve cells in the brain and lung damage . The chart that follows was taken from the Wednesday , April 14 , 1993 issue of USA Today ( `` Drug Use Up Among U.S. Eigth-graders '' by Mike Snider , p. 6D ) . Adolescents ' choices Drugs used by eighth graders in the last month : Estimated , per 100 students 1991 1992 Pct . chg. Alcohol 25.1 26.1 +4 % Cigarettes 14.3 15.5 +8 % Marijuana 3.2 3.7 +16 % Amphetamines 2.6 3.3 +27 % LSD 0.6 0.9 +50 % Cocaine 0.5 0.7 +40 % Crack 0.3 0.5 +67 % Source : University of Michigan Institute for Social Research , 1993 report We are not winning the `` war on drugs '' . I think you can see that one of the tactics that the DEA employs to give people the impression that the `` war on drugs '' is being won is to selectively quote statistics -- - only statistics that support their contention that drug use has gone down . The excerpt from Time magazine that I included in this post is an excellent example of how organizations like the DEA attempt to deceive the public . Usage of *one* particular drug may have gone down but at the same time usage of other drugs may have gone *up* ( a.k.a . substitution ) . Also , drug usage among *one* particular age group may have gone down but drug usage among another age group may have gone *up* . Therefore , if one takes a look at the big picture , taking into consideration *all* the statistics , then it 's obvious that the so-called `` war on drugs '' is being lost . Perhaps the drug war is being won as far as illegal drugs go , but if one factors in alcohol abuse , smoking , and use of inhalants , then the magnitude of the drug problem in this country can then placed in its true perspective . For those of you who do n't consider alcohol to be a drug then try drinking a fifth of whiskey sometime and then come back and tell me that it 's not a drug . Agencies like the DEA only go after *illegal* drugs . This is one of the reasons why the drug war is a fruitless attempt at preventing substance abuse -- -people will merely switch to another drug if the one they were using becomes scarce or unpopular . The solution to the drug abuse problem in this country may be to legalize some -- -not all -- -drugs whose toxicity has been shown to be within reasonable limits ( you wo n't drop dead after using it a few times ) and then couple this with a massive drug education program . The reason why I think legalization is *part* of the solution is because people seem to be able to easily obtain drugs despite the government 's efforts to the contrary -- -the money spent on drug interdiction could be spent more effectively elsewhere ( e.g. , drug education ) . Additionally , legalization would reduce crime because the profit motive would be taken out of drug trafficking which often goes along with other kinds of crime . Not to mention the fact that addicts would have less reason to prey on innocent people for their money and posessions in order to support their expensive habit ; legalization would cause the street price of drugs to fall substantially so drugs would be much more affordable to addicts . IMHO , the way to reduce substance abuse is to do to drugs what has been done to smokers : make drug use socially unacceptable rather than try to employ heavy-handed law enforcement and punish people by incarcerating them . As you already know , people in the U.S. smoke a lot less than they used to . This reduction in the number of smokers has been brought about by public awareness campaigns , laws restricting where people can light up , warning labels on cigarette packages , taxation on tobacco in order to reduce consumption , and so on . I propose that similar methods be used to reduce substance abuse after legalization has been carried out . They are as follows : * Drugs being sold must come with clear , concise information which states the possible health hazzards involved with using this product and recommendations on how the drug should be used . Things like dosage levels and how long the drug should be used ought to accompany the packaging the drug is contained in . * All drugs should be taxed at a rate that generates a lot of revenue but not so high as to encourage people to acquire drugs through illegal channels . Part of the revenue collected from drug taxes should be used to fund drug education and law enforcement . * Make it a felony to sell drugs to minors ( people under the age of 18 ) . Anyone can sell drugs but they must not dodge paying the taxes on drugs or sell drugs with the warning information absent . Failure to pay the appropiate taxes on drugs or omitting warning information should also be a felony . * Establish a government agency whose job is to insure that the purity and safety of all drugs is as high as possible . This agency would try to prevent people from getting a hold of bad drugs -- -something that is a fairly serious problem now . I 'm sure that many of the things I 've discussed in this article have been hashed out before in this newsgroup . Nevertheless , I thought it was a good idea to give my two cents ( actually a buck and a half ... ) all at once so you could get a good idea of where I currently stand on WOD . Go ahead and tear into my post ; I 'm sure there is something in it that you may wish to take a different view on or flame . : ) : ) : ) BTW , I posted the articles from USA Today to not only help prove my assertions but also to provide information on LSD usage among youths -- - something which I noticed some posters to this group were interested in .

Arab governments generally do n't care much about the Palestineans and their struggle but find it useful for political purposes back home . They are happy to leave the Palestineans largely under Israeli control because that leaves the job of controlling them to the Israelis . The Israelis do n't like this job any more than King Hussein of Jordan liked it -- and he managed to kill them off at the rate of thousands per month when they started an Intifada in Jordan . The governments of Syria , Lebanon and Egypt all feel similarly . However , proclaiming public support for the Palestinean war against Israel deflects criticism from deep problems at home and lends an air of legitimacy to even the most brutal Arab tyrants . Arab *PEOPLE* probably are n't much more sympathetic . Palestineans have shown a willingness to destabilize and plunder in Jordan , Lebanon and Kuwait and are viewed with suspicion elsewhere . You might still be right in sympathy to the war against Israel , but I suspect that many Arabs , far removed from the immediate border with Israel ( e.g . in Kuwait or Morroco ) , could n't care less . -- Jake Livni jake @ bony1.bony.com Ten years from now , George Bush will American-Occupied New York have replaced Jimmy Carter as the My opinions only - employer has no opinions . standard of a failed President .

Subject : Introduction/Disclaimers Although we 've done a fair bit of wiring , we are not electricians , and we can not be responsible for what you do . If you 're at all uncertain about what is correct or safe , *don't do it* . Contact someone qualified -- a licensed electrician , or your local electrical inspector . Electricity is no joke ; mistakes can result in shocks , fires , or electrocution . Furthermore , our discussion is based on the U.S. National Electrical Code ( NEC ) and the Canadian Electrical code ( CEC ) . To the best of our abilities , we have confirmed every detail with the electrical code , but we do n't quote sections simply to keep this thing readable . If you think we 're wrong , we invite you to correct us , but please - quote references ! The NEC and the CEC do not , in and of themselves , have the force of law . Many municipalities adopt it en toto . Others , however , do not . Check your with your local building department ( and < provincial > Hydro Inspection Offices in Canada ) to find out what applies in your area . Also , your local electrical utility may also have special requirements for electrical service installation . Bear in mind , too , that we say here applies primarily to ordinary single-family residences . Multi-family dwellings , mobile homes , commercial establishments , etc. , are sometimes governed by different rules . Also note that , contrary to popular belief in the U.S. ( and in some parts of Canada ) , Canada is not a wholly-owned subsidiary of the U.S. Consequently , the NEC does not apply in Canada . Lots of things are the same , including voltages , line frequencies , and the laws of physics . But there are a number of crucial differences in the regulations . Where we can , we've noted them , flagging the relevant passages with `` NEC '' or `` CEC '' . Remember that the CEC and NEC are minimal standards . It is often smart to go beyond their minimal requirements . Subject : What is the NEC ? Where can I get a copy ? The NEC is a model electrical code devised and published by the National Fire Protection Association , an insurance industry group . It 's revised every three years . The 1993 version has been released . You can buy a copy at a decent bookstore , or by calling them directly at 800-344-3555 . The code exists in several versions . There 's the full text , which is fairly incomprehensible . There 's an abridged edition , which has only the sections likely to apply to most houses . And there 's the NEC Handbook , which contains the `` authorized commentary '' on the code , as well as the full text . That 's the recommended version . Unfortunately , there 's no handbook for the abridged edition . And the full handbook is expensive -- US $ 65 plus shipping and handling . Subject : What is the CEC ? Where can I get a copy ? The Canadian Standards Association is an organization made up of various government agencies , power utilities , insurance companies , electrical manufacturers and other organizations . The CSA publishes CSA Standard C22.1 which is updated every two or three years . Each province adopts , with some amendments , this standard and publishes a province-specific code book . Since each province publishes its own slightly modified standard , it would be somewhat confusing to obtain the CSA standard itself . In this FAQ , `` CEC '' really means the appropriate provincial standard . In particular , this FAQ is derived from the Ontario Hydro Electrical Safety Code , 20th edition ( 1990 ) . Which is in turn based on CSA C22.1-1990 ( 16th edition ) . While differences exist between the provinces , an attempt has been made to avoid specific-to-Ontario detail . The appropriate provincial code can be obtained from electrical inspection offices of your provincial power authority . In Ontario , it 's Ontario Hydro . The Ontario Hydro book isn't overly fat . It 's about C $ 25 , and includes mailed updates . I hear that these standards are somewhat easier to read than the equivalent NEC publications . Do n't bother asking in Quebec - DIY wiring is banned throughout the province . Subject : Can I do my own wiring ? Extra pointers ? In most places , homeowners are allowed to do their own wiring . In some , they 're not . Check with your local electrical inspector . Most places wo n't permit you to do wiring on other's homes for money without a license . Nor are you permitted to do wiring in `` commercial '' buildings . Multiple dwellings ( eg : duplexes ) are usually considered `` semi-commercial '' or `` commercial '' . However , many jurisdictions will permit you to work on semi-commercial wiring if you 're supervised by a licensed electrician - if you can find one willing to supervise . If you do your own wiring , an important point : Do it NEAT and WELL ! What you really want to aim for is a better job than an electrician will do . After all , it 's your own home , and it 's you or your family that might get killed if you make a mistake . An electrician has time pressures , has the skills and knows the tricks of the trade to do a fast , safe job . In this FAQ we 've consciously given a few recommendations that are in excess of code , because we feel that it 's reasonable , and will impress the inspector . The inspector will know that you 're an amateur . You have to earn his trust . The best way of doing this is to spend your time doing as neat a job as possible . Do n't cut corners . Exceed specifications . Otherwise , the inspector may get extremely picky and fault you on the slightest transgressions . Do n't try to hide anything from the inspector . Use the proper tools . Ie : do n't use a bread knife to strip wires , or twist wires with your fingers . The inspector wo n't like it , and the results wo n't be that safe . And it takes longer . And you 're more likely to stick a hunk of 12ga wire through your hand that way . Do n't handle house wire when it 's very cold ( eg : below -10C or 16F ) . Thermoplastic house wire , particularly older types become very brittle . Subject : What do I need in the way of tools ? First , there 's the obvious -- a hammer , a drill , a few screwdrivers , both straight and Phillips-head . If you 're lucky enough to live in Canada ( or find a source of CSA-approved devices ) you need Robertson ( `` square recess '' ) screwdrivers ( # 1 and # 2 ) instead of phillips . For drilling a few holes , a 3/4 '' or 1 '' spade bit and 1/4 '' or 3/8 '' electric drill will do . If you 're doing a lot , or are working with elderly lumber , we recommend a 1/2 '' drill ( right-angle drills are wonderful . Can be rented ) and 3/4 '' or 1 '' screw-point auger drill bits . These bits pull you through , so they 're much faster and less fatiguing , even in 90 year old hardwood timbers . Screw-driver bits are useful for drills , expecially if you install your electrical boxes using screws ( drywall screws work well ) . For stripping wire , use a real wire stripper , not a knife or ordinary wire cutters . Do n't buy the $ 3 K-mart `` combo stripper , crimper and bottle opener '' types . You should expect to pay $ 15 to $ 20 for a good `` plier-type '' pair . It will have sized stripping holes , and wo n't nick or grab the wire - it should be easy to strip wire with it . One model has a small hole in the blade for forming exact wire loops for screw terminals . There are fancier types ( autostrip/cut ) , but they generally aren't necessary , and pros usually do n't use them . A pair of diagonal side cutter pliers are useful for clipping ends in constricted places . Do n't use these for stripping wire . You will need linesman pliers for twisting wires for wire nuts . You should have a pair of needle-nose pliers for fiddling inside boxes and closing loops , but it 's better to form wire loops with a `` loop former hole '' on your wire stripper - more accurate . If you 're using non-metallic cable , get a cable stripper for removing the sheath . Or , do what some pros do , they nick the end of the sheath , grab the ground wire with a pair of pliers , and simply rip the sheath back using the ground wire as a '' zipper '' , and cut the sheath off . You should n't try to strip the sheath with a knife point , because it 's too easy to slash the insulation on the conductors . Apparently Stanley utility knives fitted with linoleum cutters ( hooked blades ) can be used to strip sheath , but there is still the possibility that you 'll gouge the conductors . For any substantial amount of work with armored cable , it 's well worth your while to invest in a rotary cable splitter ( ~US $ 18 ) . Hack saws are tricky to use without cutting into the wire or the insulation . Three-prong outlet testers are a quick check for properly-wired outlets . About $ 6 . Multimeters tell you more , but are a lot more expensive , and probably not worth it for most people . A simple voltage sensor , which can detect potential through an insulated wire not supplying any devices , is extremely helpful ; they cost about US $ 10 at Radio Shack . You should have a voltage detector - to check that the wires are dead before doing work on them . Neon-bulb version are cheap ( $ 2-3 ) and work well . If you get more serious , a `` audible alarm '' type is good for tracing circuits without a helper . ( Though I 've been known to lock the drill on , and hit breakers until the scream stops ; - ) For running wires through existing walls , you need fish tape . Often , two tapes are needed , though sometimes , a bent hanger or a length of thin chain will suffice . Fish tapes can be rented . Electrical tape . Lots of it ; - ) Seriously , a good and competent wiring job will need very little tape . The tape is useful for wrapping dicy insulation in repair work . Another use is to wrap around the body of outlets and switches to cover the termination screws - I do n't do this , but drywall contractors prefer it ( to prevent explosions when the drywall knife collides with a live outlet that has no cover plate ) . Subject : What is UL listing ? The UL stands for `` Underwriters Laboratory '' . It used to be an Insurance Industry organization , but now it is independent and non-profit . It tests electrical components and equipment for potential hazards . When something is UL-listed , that means that the UL has tested the device , and it meets their requirements for safety - ie : fire or shock hazard . It does n't necessarily mean that the device actually does what it 's supposed to , just that it probably wo n't kill you . The UL does not have power of law in the U.S. -- you are permitted to buy and install non-UL-listed devices . However , insurance policies sometimes have clauses in them that will limit their liability in case of a claim made in response to the failure of a non-UL-listed device . Furthermore , in many situations the NEC will require that a wiring component used for a specific purpose is UL-listed for that purpose . Indirectly , this means that certain parts of your wiring must be UL-listed before an inspector will approve it and/or occupancy permits issued . Subject : What is CSA approval ? Every electrical device or component must be certified by the Canadian Standards Association before it can be sold in Canada . Implicit in this is that all wiring must be done with CSA-approved materials . They perform testing similar to the UL ( a bit more stringent ) , except that CSA approval is required by law . Again , like the UL , if a fire was caused by non-CSA-approved equipment , your insurance company may not have to pay the claim . In Canada , there is a branch organization of the UL , called ULC ( UL of Canada ) . ULC does not have power of law , and seems to be more a liason group between the CSA and insurance companies . Subject : Are there any cheaper , easier to read books on wiring ? USA : The following three books were suggested by our readers Residential Wiring by Jeff Markell , Craftsman Books , Carlsbad CA for $ 18.25 . ISBN 0-934041-19-9 . Practical Electrical Wiring Residential , Farm and Industrial , Based on the National Electrical Code ANSI/NFPA 70 Herbert P. Richter and W. Creighton Schwan McGraw-Hill Book Co. Wiring Simplified H. P. Richter and W. C. Schwan Park Publishing Co . Try to make sure that the book is based on the latest NEC revision . Which is currently 1990 . Canada : P.S . Knight authors and publishes a book called '' Electrical Code Simplified '' . There appears to be a version published specific to each province , and is very tied into the appropriate provincial code . It focuses on residential wiring , and is indispensible for Canadian DIY'ers . It is better to get this book than the CEC unless you do a lot of wiring ( or answer questions on the net ; - ) . It is updated each time the provincial codes are . This book is available at all DIY and hardware stores for less than C $ 10 . Subject : Inspections how and what ? Why should I get my wiring inspected ? Most jurisdictions require that you obtain a permit and inspections of any wiring that is done . Amongst other more mundane bureaucratic reasons ( like insurance companies not liking to have to pay claims ) , a permit and inspections provides some assurance that you , your family , your neighbors or subsequent owners of your home do n't get killed or lose their homes one night due to a sloppy wiring job . Most jurisdictions have the power to order you to vacate your home , or order you to tear out any wiring done without a permit . California , for instance , is particularly nasty about this . If fire starts in your home , and un-inspected wiring is at fault , insurance companies will often refuse to pay the damage claims . In general , the process goes like this : - you apply to your local inspections office or building department for a permit . You should have a sketch or detailed drawing of what you plan on doing . This is a good time to ask questions on any things you 're not sure of . If you 're doing major work , they may impose special conditions on you , require loading calculations and ask other questions . At this point they will tell you which inspections you will need . - If you 're installing a main panel , you will need to have the panel and service connections inspected before your power utility will provide a connection . This is sometimes done by the local power authority rather than the usual inspectors . - After installing the boxes and wiring , but before the insulation/walls go up , you will need a `` rough-in '' inspection . - After the walls are up , and the wiring is complete , you will need a `` final inspection '' . Subject : My house does n't meet some of these rules and regulations . Do I have to upgrade ? In general , there is no requirement to upgrade older dwellings , though there are some exceptions ( ie : smoke detectors in some cases ) . However , any new work must be done according to the latest electrical code . Also , if you do `` major '' work , you may be required to upgrade certain existing portions or all of your system . Check with your local electrical inspector . Subject : A word on voltages : 110/115/117/120/125/220/240 One thing where things might get a bit confusing is the different numbers people bandy about for the voltage of a circuit . One person might talk about 110V , another 117V or another 120V . These are all , in fact , exactly the same thing ... In North America the utility companies are required to supply a split-phase 240 volt ( +-5 % ) feed to your house . This works out as two 120V +- 5 % legs . Additionally , since there are resistive voltage drops in the house wiring , it 's not unreasonable to find 120V has dropped to 110V or 240V has dropped to 220V by the time the power reaches a wall outlet . Especially at the end of an extension cord or long circuit run . For a number of reasons , some historical , some simple personal orneryness , different people choose call them by slightly different numbers . This FAQ has chosen to be consistent with calling them `` 110V '' and '' 220V '' , except when actually saying what the measured voltage will be . Confusing ? A bit . Just ignore it . One thing that might make this a little more understandable is that the nameplates on equipment ofen show the lower ( ie : 110V instead of 120V ) value . What this implies is that the device is designed to operate properly when the voltage drops that low . 208V is *not* the same as 240V . 208V is the voltage between phases of a 3-phase `` Y '' circuit that is 120V from neutral to any hot . 480V is the voltage between phases of a 3-phase `` Y '' circuit that 's 277V from hot to neutral . In keeping with 110V versus 120V strangeness , motors intended to run on 480V three phase are often labelled as 440V ... Subject : What does an electrical service look like ? There are logically four wires involved with supplying the main panel with power . Three of them will come from the utility pole , and a fourth ( bare ) wire comes from elsewhere . The bare wire is connected to one or more long metal bars pounded into the ground , or to a wire buried in the foundation , or sometimes to the water supply pipe ( has to be metal , continuous to where the main water pipe entering the house . Watch out for galvanic action conductivity `` breaks '' ( often between copper and iron pipe ) ) . This is the `` grounding conductor '' . It is there to make sure that the third prong on your outlets is connected to ground . This wire normally carries no current . One of the other wires will be white ( or black with white or yellow stripes , or sometimes simply black ) . It is the neutral wire . It is connected to the `` centre tap '' ( CEC ; `` center tap '' in the NEC ) of the distribution transformer supplying the power . It is connected to the grounding conductor in only one place ( often inside the panel ) . The neutral and ground should not be connected anywhere else . Otherwise , weird and/or dangerous things may happen . Furthermore , there should only be one grounding system in a home . Some codes require more than one grounding electrode . These will be connected together , or connected to the neutral at a common point - still one grounding system . Adding additional grounding electrodes connected to other portions of the house wiring is unsafe and contrary to code . If you add a subpanel , the ground and neutral are usually brought as separate conductors from the main panel , and are not connected together in the subpanel ( ie : still only one neutral-ground connection ) . However , in some situations ( certain categories of separate buildings ) you actually do have to provide a second grounding electrode - consult your inspector . The other two wires will usually be black , and are the `` hot '' wires . They are attached to the distribution transformer as well . The two black wires are 180 degrees out of phase with each other . This means if you connect something to both hot wires , the voltage will be 220 volts . If you connect something to the white and either of the two blacks you will get 110V . Some panels seem to only have three wires coming into them . This is either because the neutral and ground are connected together at a different point ( eg : the meter or pole ) and one wire is doing dual-duty as both neutral and ground , or in some rare occasions , the service has only one hot wire ( 110V only service ) . Subject : What is a circuit ? Inside the panel , connections are made to the incoming wires . These connections are then used to supply power to selected portions of the home . There are three different combinations : 1 ) one hot , one neutral , and ground : 110V circuit . 2 ) two hots , no neutral , and ground : 220V circuit . 3 ) two hots , neutral , and ground : 220V circuit + neutral , and/or two 110V circuits with a common neutral . ( 1 ) is used for most circuits supplying receptacles and lighting within your house . ( 3 ) is usually used for supplying power to major appliances such as stoves , and dryers - they often have need for both 220V and 110V , or for bringing several circuits from the panel box to a distribution point . ( 2 ) is usually for special 220V motor circuits , electric heaters , or air conditioners . [ Note : In the US , the NEC frequently permits a circuit similar to ( 2 ) be used for stoves and dryers - namely , that there are two hot wires , and a wire that does dual duty as neutral and ground , and is connected to the frame as well as providing the neutral for 110V purposes - three prong plugs instead of four ( *only* for stoves/dryers connected to the main panel . When connected to most sub-panels , 4 prong plugs and receptacles are required ) . In our not-so-humble opinion this is crazy , but the NFPA claims that this practice was re-evaluated for the 1992 NEC , and found to be safe . Check your local codes , or inquire as to local practice -- there are restrictions on when this is permissible . ] ( 1 ) is usually wired with three conductor wire : black for hot , white for neutral , and bare for grounding . ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) have one hot wire coloured red , the other black , a bare wire for grounding , and in ( 3 ) a white wire for neutral . You will sometimes see ( 2 ) wired with just a black , white and ground wire . Since the white is `` hot '' in this case , both the NEC and CEC requires that the white wire be `` permanently marked '' at the ends to indicate that it is a live wire . Usually done with paint , nail polish or sometimes electrical tape . Each circuit is attached to the main wires coming into the panel through a circuit breaker or fuse . There are , in a few locales , circuits that look like ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) or ( 3 ) except that they have two bare ground wires . Some places require this for hot tubs and the like ( one ground is `` frame ground '' , the other attaches to the motor ) . This may or may not be an alternative to GFCI protection . Subject : `` grounding '' versus `` grounded '' versus `` neutral '' . According to the terminology in the CEC and NEC , the '' grounding '' conductor is for the safety ground , i.e. , the green or bare wire . The word `` neutral '' is reserved for the white when you have a circuit with more than one `` hot '' wire . Since the white wire is connected to neutral and the grounding conductor inside the panel , the proper term is `` grounded conductor '' . However , the potential confusion between `` grounded conductor '' and `` grounding conductor '' can lead to potentially lethal mistakes - you should never use the bare wire as a `` grounded conductor '' or white wire as the `` grounding conductor '' , even though they are connected together in the panel . [ But not in subpanels - subpanels are fed neutral and ground separately from the main panel . Usually . ] In the trade , and in common usage , the word `` neutral '' is used for `` grounded conductor '' . This FAQ uses `` neutral '' simply to avoid potential confusion . We recommend that you use `` neutral '' too . Thus the white wire is always ( except in some light switch applications ) neutral . Not ground . Subject : What does a fuse or breaker do ? What are the differences ? Fuses and circuit breakers are designed to interrupt the power to a circuit when the current flow exceeds safe levels . For example , if your toaster shorts out , a fuse or breaker should '' trip '' , protecting the wiring in the walls from melting . As such , fuses and breakers are primarily intended to protect the wiring -- UL or CSA approval supposedly indicates that the equipment itself wo n't cause a fire . Fuses contain a narrow strip of metal which is designed to melt ( safely ) when the current exceeds the rated value , thereby interrupting the power to the circuit . Fuses trip relatively fast . Which can sometimes be a problem with motors which have large startup current surges . For motor circuits , you can use a `` time-delay '' fuse ( one brand is `` fusetron '' ) which will avoid tripping on momentary overloads . A fusetron looks like a spring-loaded fuse . A fuse can only trip once , then it must be replaced . Breakers are fairly complicated mechanical devices . They usually consist of one spring loaded contact which is latched into position against another contact . When the current flow through the device exceeds the rated value , a bimetallic strip heats up and bends . By bending it `` trips '' the latch , and the spring pulls the contacts apart . Circuit breakers behave similarly to fusetrons - that is , they tend to take longer to trip at moderate overloads than ordinary fuses . With high overloads , they trip quickly . Breakers can be reset a finite number of times - each time they trip , or are thrown when the circuit is in use , some arcing takes place , which damages the contacts . Thus , breakers should not be used in place of switches unless they are specially listed for the purpose . Neither fuses nor breakers `` limit '' the current per se . A dead short on a circuit can cause hundreds or sometimes even thousands of amperes to flow for a short period of time , which can often cause severe damage . Subject : Breakers ? Ca n't I use fuses ? Statistics show that fuse panels have a significantly higher risk of causing a fire than breaker panels . This is usually due to the fuse being loosely screwed in , or the contacts corroding and heating up over time , or the wrong size fuse being installed , or the proverbial `` replace the fuse with a penny '' trick . Since breakers are more permanently installed , and have better connection mechanisms , the risk of fire is considerably less . Fuses are prone to explode under extremely high overload . When a fuse explodes , the metallic vapor cloud becomes a conducting path . Result ? from complete meltdown of the electrical panel , melted service wiring , through fires in the electrical distribution transformer and having your house burn down . Breakers do n't do this . Many jurisdictions , particularly in Canada , no longer permit fuse panels in new installations . The NEC does permit new fuse panels in some rare circumstances ( requiring the special inserts to `` key '' the fuseholder to specific size fuses ) Some devices , notably certain large air conditioners , require fuse protection in addition to the breaker at the panel . The fuse is there to protect the motor windings from overload . Check the labeling on the unit . This is usually only on large permanently installed motors . The installation instructions will tell you if you need one . Subject : What size wire should I use ? For a 20 amp circuit , use 12 gauge wire . For a 15 amp circuit , you can use 14 gauge wire ( in most locales ) . For a long run , though , you should use the next larger size wire , to avoid voltage drops . 12 gauge is only slightly more expensive than 14 gauge , though it 's stiffer and harder to work with . Here 's a quick table for normal situations . Go up a size for more than 100 foot runs , when the cable is in conduit , or ganged with other wires in a place where they ca n't dissipate heat easily : Gauge Amps 14 15 12 20 10 30 8 40 6 65 We do n't list bigger sizes because it starts getting very dependent on the application and precise wire type . Subject : Where do these numbers come from ? There are two considerations , voltage drop and heat buildup . The smaller the wire is , the higher the resistance is . When the resistance is higher , the wire heats up more , and there is more voltage drop in the wiring . The former is why you need higher-temperature insulation and/or bigger wires for use in conduit ; the latter is why you should use larger wire for long runs . Neither effect is very significant over very short distances . There are some very specific exceptions , where use of smaller wire is allowed . The obvious one is the line cord on most lamps . Do n't try this unless you 're certain that your use fits one of those exceptions ; you can never go wrong by using larger wire . Subject : What does `` 14-2 '' mean ? This is used to describe the size and quantity of conductors in a cable . The first number specifies the gauge . The second the number of current carrying conductors in the wire - but remember there 's usually an extra ground wire . `` 14-2 '' means 14 gauge , two insulated current carrying wires , plus bare ground . -2 wire usually has a black , white and bare ground wire . Sometimes the white is red instead for 220V circuits without neutral . In the latter case , the sheath is usually red too . -3 wire usually has a black , red , white and bare ground wire . Usually carrying 220V with neutral . Subject : What is a `` wirenut '' / '' marrette '' / '' marr connector '' ? How are they used ? A wire nut is a cone shaped threaded plastic thingummy that 's used to connect wires together . `` Marrette '' or `` Marr connector '' are trade names . You 'll usually use a lot of them in DIY wiring . In essence , you strip the end of the wires about an inch , twist them together , then twist the wirenut on . Though some wirenuts advertise that you do n't need to twist the wire , do it anyways - it 's more mechanically and electrically secure . There are many different sizes of wire nut . You should check that the wire nut you 're using is the correct size for the quantity and sizes of wire you 're connecting together . Do n't just gimble the wires together with a pair of pliers or your fingers . Use a pair of blunt nose ( `` linesman '' ) pliers , and carefully twist the wires tightly and neatly . Sometimes it 's a good idea to trim the resulting end to make sure it goes in the wirenut properly . Some people wrap the `` open '' end of the wirenut with electrical tape . This is probably not a good idea - the inspector may tear it off during an inspection . It 's usually done because a bit of bare wire is exposed outside the wire nut - instead of taping it , the connection should be redone . Subject : What is a GFI/GFCI ? A GFCI is a `` ground-fault circuit interrupter '' . It measures the current current flowing through the hot wire and the neutral wire . If they differ by more than a few milliamps , the presumption is that current is leaking to ground via some other path . This may be because of a short circuit to the chassis of an appliance , or to the ground lead , or through a person . Any of these situations is hazardous , so the GFCI trips , breaking the circuit . GFCIs do not protect against all kinds of electric shocks . If , for example , you simultaneously touched the hot and neutral leads of a circuit , and no part of you was grounded , a GFCI would n't help . All of the current that passed from the hot lead into you would return via the neutral lead , keeping the GFCI happy . The two pairs of connections on a GFCI outlet are not symmetric . One is labeled LOAD ; the other , LINE . The incoming power feed *must* be connected to the LINE side , or the outlet will not be protected . The LOAD side can be used to protect all devices downstream from it . Thus , a whole string of outlets can be covered by a single GFCI outlet . Subject : Where should GFCIs be used ? The NEC mandates GFCIs for 110V , 15A or 20A single phase outlets , in bathrooms , kitchens within 6 ' of the sink , garages , unfinished basements or crawl spaces , outdoors , near a pool , or just about anywhere else where you 're likely to encounter water or dampness . There are exceptions for inaccessible outlets , those dedicated to appliances `` occupying fixed space '' , typically refrigerators and freezers , and for sump pumps and laundry appliances . The CEC does not mandate as many GFCIs . In particular , there is no requirement to protect kitchen outlets , or most garage or basement outlets . Basement outlets must be protected if you have a dirt floor , garage outlets if they 're near the door to outside . Bathrooms and most exterior outlets must have GFCIs . Even if you are not required to have GFCI protection , you may want to consider installing it anyway . Unless you need a GFCI breaker ( see below ) , the cost is low . In the U.S. , GFCI outlets can cost as little as US $ 8 . ( Costs are a bit higher in Canada : C $ 12 . ) Evaluate your own risk factors . Does your finished basement ever get wet ? Do you have small children ? Do you use your garage outlets to power outdoor tools ? Does water or melted snow ever puddle inside your garage ? Subject : Where should n't I use a GFCI ? GFCIs are generally not used on circuits that ( a ) do n't pose a safety risk , and ( b ) are used to power equipment that must run unattended for long periods of time . Refrigerators , freezers , and sump pumps are good examples . The rationale is that GFCIs are sometimes prone to nuisance trips . Some people claim that the inductive delay in motor windings can cause a momentary current imbalance , tripping the GFCI . Note , though , that most GFCI trips are real ; if you 're getting a lot of trips for no apparent reason , you 'd be well-advised to check your wiring before deciding that the GFCI is broken or useless . Subject : What is the difference between a GFCI outlet and a GFCI breaker ? For most situations , you can use either a GFCI outlet as the first device on the circuit , or you can install a breaker with a built-in GFCI . The former is generally preferred , since GFCI breakers are quite expensive . For example , an ordinary GE breaker costs ~US $ 5 ; the GFCI model costs ~US $ 35 . There is one major exception : if you need to protect a `` multi-wire branch circuit '' ( two or more circuits sharing a common neutral wire ) , such as a Canadian-style kitchen circuit , you 'll need a multi-pole GFCI breaker . Unfortunately , these are expensive ; the cost can range into the hundreds of dollars , depending on what brand of panel box you have . But if you must protect such a circuit ( say , for a pool heater ) , you have no choice . One more caveat -- GFCI outlets are bulky . You may want to use an oversize box when installing them . On second thought , use large ( actually deep ) boxes everywhere . You 'll thank yourself for it . Incidentally , if you 're installing a GFCI to ensure that one specific outlet is protected ( such as a bathroom ) , you don't really have to go to all of the trouble to find the first outlet in the circuit , you could simply find the first outlet in the bathroom , and not GFCI anything upstream of it . But protecting the whole circuit is preferred . When you install a GFCI , it 's a good idea to use the little '' ground fault protected '' stickers that come with it and mark the outlets downstream of the GFCI . You can figure out which outlets are `` downstream '' , simply by tripping the GFCI with the test button and see which outlets are dead . Subject : What 's the purpose of the ground prong on an outlet , then ? Apart from their use in electronics , which we wo n't comment on , and for certain fluorescent lights ( they wo n't turn on without a good ground connection ) , they 're intended to guard against insulation failures within the device . Generally , the case of the appliance is connected to the ground lead . If there 's an insulation failure that shorts the hot lead to the case , the ground lead conducts the electricity away safely ( and possibly trips the circuit breaker in the process ) . If the case is not grounded and such a short occurs , the case is live -- and if you touch it while you 're grounded , you 'll get zapped . Of course , if the circuit is GFCI-protected , it will be a very tiny zap -- which is why you can use GFCIs to replace ungrounded outlets ( both NEC and CEC ) . There are some appliances that should *never* be grounded . In particular , that applies to toasters and anything else with exposed conductors . Consider : if you touch the heating electrode in a toaster , and you 're not grounded , nothing will happen . If you 're slightly grounded , you 'll get a small shock ; the resistance will be too high . But if the case were grounded , and you were holding it , you 'd be the perfect path to ground ... Subject : Why is one prong wider than the other ? Polarization Nowadays , many two-prong devices have one prong wider than the other . This is so that the device could rely ( not guaranteed ! ) on one specific wire being neutral , and the other hot . This is particularly advantageous in light fixtures , where the the shell should neutral ( safety ) , or other devices which want to have an approximate ground reference ( ie : some radios ) . Most 2-prong extension cords have wide prongs too . This requires that you wire your outlets and plugs the right way around . You want the wide prong to be neutral , and the narrow one hot . Most outlets have a darker metal for the hot screw , and lighter coloured screw for the neutral . If not , you can usually figure out which is which by which prong the terminating screw connects to . Subject : What kind of outlets do I need in a kitchen ? The NEC requires at least two 20 amp `` small appliance circuits '' for kitchens . The CEC requires split-duplex receptacles . Outlets must be installed such that no point is more than 24 '' ( NEC ) ( 900 mm CEC ) from an outlet . Every counter wider than 12 '' ( NEC ) or 300 mm ( CEC ) must have at least one outlet . The circuit these outlets are on may not feed any outlets except in the kitchen , pantry , or dining room . Furthermore , these circuits are in addition to any required for refrigerators , stoves , microwaves , lighting , etc . Non-dedicated outlets within 6 ' of a sink *must* be protected by a GFCI ( NEC only ) . Split duplex receptacles are fed with a 220V circuit . The tab is broken on the hot side of the outlet , and one hot goes to the upper outlet , and the other hot goes to the lower outlet . The neutral connects to both outlets through one screw . When '' carrying through '' to another outlet , the neutral must be pigtailed , such that removing the outlet , or having the neutral connection fall off does n't cause the neutral to disconnect from downstream outlets . Subject : Where must outlets and switches be in bathrooms ? There must be at least one outlet in each bathroom , adjacent to the sink , in addition to any outlet that may be incorporated in the light fixture . All such outlets *must* be GFCI-protected . Subject : What is Romex/NM/NMD ? What is BX ? When should I use each ? Romex is a brand name for a type of plastic insulated wire . Sometimes called non-metallic sheath . The formal name is NM . This is suitable for use in dry , protected areas ( ie : inside stud walls , on the sides of joists etc . ) , that are not subject to mechanical damage or excessive heat . Most newer homes are wired almost exclusively with NM wire . There are several different categories of NM cable . BX cable -- technically known as armored cable or `` AC '' has a flexible aluminum or steel sheath over the conductors and is fairly resistant to damage . TECK cable is AC with an additional external thermoplastic sheath . Protection for cable in concealed locations : where NM or AC cable is run through studs , joists or similar wooden members , the outer surface of the cable must be kept at least 32mm/1.25 '' ( CEC & NEC ) from the edges of the wooden members , or the cable should be protected from mechanical injury . This latter protection can take the form of metal plates ( such as spare outlet box ends ) or conduit . [ Note : inspector-permitted practise in Canada suggests that armored cable , or flexible conduit can be used as the mechanical protection , but this is technically illegal . ] Additional protection recommendations ( these are rules in the Canadian codes - they are reasonable answers to the vague references to `` exposed to mechanical damage '' in both the NEC and CEC ) : - NM cable should be protected against mechanical damage where it passes through floors or on the surface of walls in exposed locations under 5 feet from the floor . Ie : use AC instead , flexible conduit , wooden guards etc . - Where cable is suspended , as in , connections to furnaces or water heaters , the wire should be protected . Canadian practise is usually to install a junction or outlet box on the wall , and use a short length of AC cable or NM cable in flexible conduit to `` jump '' to the appliance . Stapling NM to a piece of lumber is also sometimes used . - Where NM cable is run in close proximity to heating ducts or pipe , heat transfer should be minimized by means of a 25mm/1 '' air space , or suitable insulation material ( a wad of fiberglass ) . - NM cable shall be supported within 300mm/1 ' of every box or fitting , and at intervals of no more than 1.5m/5 ' . Holes in joists or studs are considered `` supports '' . Some slack in the cable should be provided adjacent to each box . [ while fishing cable is technically in violation , it is permitted where `` proper '' support is impractical ] - 2 conductor NM cable should never be stapled on edge . [ Knight also insists on only one cable per staple , referring to the `` workmanship '' clause , but this seems more honoured in the breach ... ] - cable should never be buried in plaster , cement or similar finish . - cable should be protected where it runs behind baseboards . - Cable may not be run on the upper edge of ceiling joists or the lower edges of rafters where the headroom is more than 1m ( 39 '' ) . Whenever BX cable is terminated at a box with a clamp , small plastic bushings must be inserted in the end of the cable to prevent the clamps forcing the sharp ends of the armor through the insulation . BX is sometimes a good idea in a work shop unless covered by solid wall coverings . In places where damage is more likely ( like on the back wall of a garage ; - ) , you may be required to use conduit , a UL- ( or CSA- ) approved metal pipe . You use various types of fittings to join the pipe or provide entrance/exit for the wire . Service entrances frequently use a plastic conduit . In damp places ( eg : buried wiring to outdoor lighting ) you will need special wire ( eg : CEC NMW90 , NEC UF ) . NMW90 looks like very heavy-duty NMD90 . You will usually need short lengths of conduit where the wire enters/exits the ground . [ See underground wiring section . ] Thermoplastic sheath wire ( such as NM , NMW etc . ) should not be exposed to direct sunlight unless explicitly approved for that purpose . Many electrical codes do not permit the routing of wire through furnace ducts , including cold air return plenums constructed by metal sheeting enclosing joist spaces . The reason for this is that if there 's a fire , the ducting will spread toxic gasses from burning insulation very rapidly through the building . Teflon insulated wire is permitted in plenums in many areas . Canada appears to use similar wire designations to the US , except that Canadian wire designations usually include the temperature rating in Celsius . Eg : `` AC90 '' versus `` AC '' . In the US , NM-B is 90 degrees celcius . NOTE : local codes vary . This is one of the items that changes most often . Eg : Chicago codes require conduit *everywhere* . There are very different requirements for mobile homes . Check your local codes , *especially* if you 're doing anything that 's the slightest out of the ordinary .

The NEC permits use of plastic boxes with non-metallic cable only . The reasoning is simple -- with armored cable , the box itself provides ground conductor continuity . U.S. plastic boxes do n't use metal cable clamps . The CEC is slightly different . The CEC never permits cable armor as a grounding conductor . However , you must still provide ground continuity for metallic sheath . The CEC also requires grounding of any metal cable clamps on plastic boxes . The advantage of plastic boxes is comparatively minor even for non-metallic sheathed cable -- you can avoid making one ground connection and they sometimes cost a little less . On the other hand , plastic boxes are more vulnerable to impacts . For exposed or shop wiring , metal boxes are probably better . Subject : Junction box positioning ? A junction box is a box used only for connecting wires together . Junction boxes must be located in such a way that they 're accessible later . Ie : not buried under plaster . Excessive use of junction boxes is often a sign of sloppy installation , and inspectors may get nasty . Subject : Can I install a replacement light fixture ? In general , one can replace fixtures freely , subject to a few caveats . First , of course , one should check the amperage rating of the circuit . If your heart is set on installing half a dozen 500 watt floodlights , you may need to run a new wire back to the panel box . But there are some more subtle constraints as well . For example , older house wiring does n't have high-temperature insulation . The excess heat generated by a ceiling-mounted lamp can and will cause the insulation to deteriorate and crack , with obvious bad results . Some newer fixtures are specifically marked for high temperature wire only . ( You may find , in fact , that your ceiling wiring already has this problem , in which case replacing any devices is a real adventure . ) Other concerns include providing a suitable ground for some fluorescent fixtures , and making sure that the ceiling box and its mounting are strong enough to support the weight of a heavy chandelier or ceiling fan . You may need to install a new box specifically listed for this purpose . A 2x4 across the ceiling joists makes a good support . Metal brackets are also available that can be fished into ceilings thru the junction box hole and mounted between the joists . There are special rules for recessed light fixtures such as '' pot '' lamps or heat lamps . When these are installed in insulated ceilings , they can present a very substantial fire hazard . The CEC provides for the installation of pot lamps in insulated ceilings , provided that the fixture is boxed in a `` coffin '' ( usually 8'x16 '' x12 '' - made by making a pair of joists 12 '' high , and covering with plywood ) that does n't have any insulation . ( Yes , that 's 8 *feet* long ) NEC rules are somewhat less stringent . They require at least 3 '' clearance between the fixture and any sort of thermal insulation . The rules also say that one should not obstruct free air movement , which means that a CEC-style `` coffin '' might be worthwhile . Presumably , that 's up to the local inspector . [ The CEC doesn't actually mandate the coffin per-se , this seems to be an inspector requirement to make absolutely certain that the fixture ca n't get accidentally buried in insulation . Ie : if you have insulation blown in later . ] There are now fixtures that contain integral thermal cutouts and fairly large cases that can be buried directly in insulation . They are usually limited to 75 watt bulbs , and are unfortunately , somewhat more expensive than the older types . Before you use them , you should ensure that they have explicit UL or CSA approval for such uses . Follow the installation instructions carefully ; the prescribed location for the sensor can vary . There does not yet appear to be a heat lamp fixture that is approved for use in insulation . The `` coffin '' appears the only legal approach . Subject : What does it mean when the lights brighten when a motor starts ? This usually means that the neutral wire in the panel is loose . Depending on the load balance , one hot wire may end up being more than 110V , and the other less than 110V , with respect to ground . This is a very hazardous situation - it can destroy your electronic equipment , possibly start fires , and in some situations electrocute you ( ie : some US jurisdictions require the stove frame connected to neutral ) . If this happens , contact your electrical authority immediately and have them come and check out the problem . Note : a brief ( < 1 second ) brightening is sometimes normal with lighting and motors on the same 220V with neutral circuit . A loose main panel neutral will usually show increased brightness far longer than one second . In case of doubt , get help . Subject : What is 3 phase power ? Should I use it ? Can I get it in my house ? Three phase power has three `` hot '' wires , 120 degrees out of phase with each other . These are usually used for large motors because it is more `` efficient '' , provides a bit more starting torque , and because the motors are simpler and hence cheaper . You 're most likely to encounter a 3 phase circuit that shows 110 volts between any hot and ground , and 208 volts between any two hots . The latter shows the difference between a normal 220V/110V common neutral circuit , which is 240 volts between the two hots . There are 3 phase circuits with different voltages . Bringing in a 3 phase feed to your house is usually ridiculously expensive , or impossible . If the equipment you want to run has a standard motor mount , it is *MUCH* cheaper to buy a new 110V or 220V motor for it . In some cases it is possible to run 3 phase equipment on ordinary power if you have a `` capacitor start '' unit , or use a larger motor as a ( auto- ) generator . These are tricky , but are a good solution if the motor is non-standard size , or too expensive or too big to replace . The Taunton Press book `` The Small Shop '' has an article on how to do this if you must . Note that you lose any possible electrical efficiency by using such a converter . The laws of thermodynamics guarantee that . Subject : Is it better to run motors at 110 or 220 ? Theoretically , it does n't make any difference . However , there is a difference is the amount of power lost in the supply wiring . All things being equal , a 220V motor will lose 4 times less power in the house wiring than a 110V motor . This also means that the startup surge loss will be less , and the motor will get to speed quicker . And in some circumstances , the smaller power loss will lead to longer motor life . This is usually irrelevant unless the supply wires are more than 50 feet long . Subject : What is this nonsense about 3HP on 110V 15A circuits ? It is a universal physical law that 1 HP is equal to 746 watts . Given heating loss , power factor and other inefficiencies , it is usually best to consider 1 HP is going to need 1000-1200 watts . A 110V 15A circuit can only deliver 1850 watts to a motor , so it can not possibly be more than approximately 2 HP . Given rational efficiency factors , 1.5HP is more like it . Some equipment manufacturers ( Sears in particular , most router manufacturers in general ; - ) advertise a HP rating that is far in excess of what is possible . They are giving you a `` stall horsepower '' or similar . That means the power is measured when the motor is just about to stop turning because of the load . What they do n't mention is that if you kept it in that condition for more than a few seconds hopefully your breaker will trip , otherwise the motor will melt -- it 's drawing far more current than it can continuously . When comparing motors , compare the continuous horsepower . This should be on the motor nameplate . If you ca n't find that figure , check the amperage rating , which is always present . Subject : How do I convert two prong receptacles to three prong ? Older homes frequently have two-prong receptacles instead of the more modern three . These receptacles have no safety ground , and the cabling usually has no ground wire . Neither the NEC or CEC permits installing new 2 prong receptacles anymore . There are several different approaches to solving this : 1 ) If the wiring is done through conduit or BX , and the conduit is continuous back to the panel , you can connect the third prong of a new receptacle to the receptacle box . NEC mainly - CEC frowns on this practise . 2 ) If there is a copper cold water pipe going nearby , and it 's continuous to the main house ground point , you can run a conductor to it from the third prong . 3 ) Run a ground conductor back to the main panel . 4 ) Easiest : install a GFCI receptacle . The ground lug should not be connected to anything , but the GFCI protection itself will serve instead . The GFCI will also protect downstream ( possibly also two prong outlets ) . If you do this to protect downstream outlets , the grounds must not be connected together . Since it would n't be connected to a real ground , a wiring fault could energize the cases of 3 prong devices connected to other outlets . Be sure , though , that there aren't indirect ground plug connections , such as via the sheath on BX cable . The CEC permits you to replace a two prong receptacle with a three prong if you fill the U ground with a non-conducting goop . Like caulking compound . This is not permitted in the NEC . Subject : Are you sure about GFCIs and ungrounded outlets ? Should the test button work ? We 're sure about what the NEC and CEC say . Remember , though , that your local codes may vary . As for the TEST button -- there's a resistor connecting the LOAD side of the hot wire to the LINE side of the neutral wire when you press the TEST button . Current through this resistor shows up as an imbalance , and trips the GFCI . This is a simple , passive , and reliable test , and does n't require a real ground to work . If your GFCI does not trip when you press the TEST button , it is very probably defective or miswired . Again : if the test button does n't work , something 's broken , and potentially dangerous . The problem should be corrected immediately . The instructions that come with some GFCIs specify that the ground wire must be connected . We do not know why they say this . The causes may be as mundane as an old instruction sheet , or with the formalities of UL or CSA listing -- perhaps the device was never tested without the ground wire being connected . On the other hand , UL or CSA approval should only have been granted if the device behaves properly in *all* listed applications , including ungrounded outlet replacement . ( One of us called Leviton ; their GFCIs are labeled for installation on grounded circuits only . The technician was surprised to see that ; he agreed that the NEC does not require it , and promised to investigate . ) Subject : How should I wire my shop ? As with any other kind of wiring , you need enough power for all devices that will be on simultaneously . The code specifies that you should stay under 80 % of the nominal capacity of the circuit . For typical home shop use , this means one circuit for the major power tools , and possibly one for a dust collector or shop vac . Use at least 12 gauge wire -- many power tools have big motors , with a big start-up surge . If you can , use 20 amp breakers ( NEC ) , though CEC requires standard 20A receptacles which means you 'd have to `` replug '' all your equipment . Lights should either be on a circuit of their own -- and not shared with circuits in the rest of the house -- or be on at least two separate circuits . The idea is that you want to avoid a situation where a blade is still spinning at several thousand RPM , while you 're groping in the dark for the OFF switch . Do install lots of outlets . It 's easier to install them in the beginning , when you do n't have to cut into an existing cable . It 's useful if at least two circuits are accessible at each point , so you can run a shop vac or a compressor at the same time as the tool you really want . But use metal boxes and plates , and maybe even metal-sheathed cable ; you may have objects flying around at high speeds if something goes a bit wrong . Note that some jurisdictions have a `` no horizontal wiring '' rule in workshops or other unfinished areas that are used for working . What this means is that all wiring must be run along structural members . Ie : stapled to studs . Other possible shop circuits include heater circuits , 220V circuits for some large tools , and air compressor circuits . Do n't overload circuits , and do n't use extension cords if you can help it , unless they 're rated for high currents . ( A coiled extension cord is not as safe as a straight length of wire of the same gauge . Also , the insulation wo n't withstand as much heat , and heat dissipation is the critical issue . ) If your shop is located at some remove from your main panel , you should probably install a subpanel , and derive your shop wiring from it . If you have young children , you may want to equip this panel with a cut-off switch , and possibly a lock . If you want to install individual switches to `` safe '' particular circuits , make sure you get ones rated high enough . For example , ordinary light switches are not safely able to handle the start-up surge generated by a table saw . Buy `` horsepower-rated '' switches instead . Finally , note that most home shops are in garages or unfinished basements ; hence the NEC requirements for GFCIs apply . And even if you `` know '' that you 'd never use one of your shop outlets to run a lawn mower , the next owner of your house might have a different idea . Note : Fine Woodworking magazine often carries articles on shop wiring . April 1992 is one place to start . Subject : Underground Wiring You will need to prepare a trench to specifications , use special wire , protect the wire with conduit or special plastic tubing and possibly lumber ( do n't use creosoted lumber , it rots thermoplastic insulation and acts as a catalyst in the corrosion of lead ) . The transition from in-house to underground wire is generally via conduit . All outdoor boxes must be specifically listed for the purpose , and contain the appropriate gaskets , fittings , etc . If the location of the box is subject to immersion in water , a more serious style of water-proof box is needed . And of course , do n't forget the GFCIs . The required depths and other details vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction , so we suggest you consult your inspector about your specific situation . A hint : buy a roll of bright yellow tape that says `` buried power line '' and bury it a few inches above where the wire has been placed . Subject : Aluminum wiring During the 1970 's , aluminum ( instead of copper ) wiring became quite popular and was extensively used . Since that time , aluminum wiring has been implicated in a number of house fires , and most jurisdictions no longer permit it in new installations . We recommend , even if you 're allowed to , that do not use it for new wiring . But do n't panic if your house has aluminum wiring . Aluminum wiring , when properly installed , can be just as safe as copper . Aluminum wiring is , however , very unforgiving of improper installation . We will cover a bit of the theory behind potential problems , and what you can do to make your wiring safe . The main problem with aluminum wiring is a phenomenon known as '' cold creep '' . When aluminum wiring warms up , it expands . When it cools down , it contracts . Unlike copper , when aluminum goes through a number of warm/cool cycles it loses a bit of tightness each time . To make the problem worse , aluminum oxidises , or corrodes when in contact with certain types of metal , so the resistance of the connection goes up . Which causes it to heat up and corrode/ oxidize still more . Eventually the wire may start getting very hot , melt the insulation or fixture it 's attached to , and possibly even cause a fire . Since people usually encounter aluminum wiring when they move into a house built during the 70 's , we will cover basic points of safe aluminum wiring . We suggest that , if you 're considering purchasing a home with aluminum wiring , or have discovered it later , that you hire a licensed electrician or inspector to check over the wiring for the following things : 1 ) Fixtures ( eg : outlets and switches ) directly attached to aluminum wiring should be rated for it . The device will be stamped with `` Al/Cu '' or `` CO/ALR '' . The latter supersedes the former , but both are safe . These fixtures are somewhat more expensive than the ordinary ones . 2 ) Wires should be properly connected ( at least 3/4 way around the screw in a clockwise direction ) . Connections should be tight . While repeated tightening of the screws can make the problem worse , during the inspection it would pay off to snug up each connection . Note that aluminum wiring is still often used for the main service entrance cable . It should be inspected . 3 ) `` push-in '' terminals are an extreme hazard with aluminum wire . Any connections using push-in terminals should be redone with the proper screw connections immediately . 4 ) There should be no signs of overheating : darkened connections , melted insulation , or `` baked '' fixtures . Any such damage should be repaired . 5 ) Connections between aluminum and copper wire need to be handled specially . Current Canadian codes require that the wire nut used must be specially marked for connecting aluminum to copper . The NEC requires that the wire be connected together using special crimp devices , with an anti-oxidant grease . The tools and materials for the latter are quite expensive - not practical to do it yourself unless you can rent the tool . 6 ) Any non-rated receptacle can be connected to aluminum wiring by means of a short copper `` pigtail '' . See ( 5 ) above . 7 ) Shows reasonable workmanship : neat wiring , properly stripped ( not nicked ) wire etc . If , when considering purchasing a home , an inspection of the wiring shows no problems or only one or two , we believe that you can consider the wiring safe . If there are signs of problems in many places , we suggest you look elsewhere . If the wrong receptacles are used , you can replace them with the proper type , or use pigtails - having this professionally done can range from $ 3 to $ 10 per receptacle/switch . You can do this yourself too . Subject : I 'm buying a house ! What should I do ? Congratulations . But ... It 's generally a good idea to hire an inspector to look through the house for hidden gotchas . Not just for wiring , but plumbing and structural as well . If an inspection of the wiring shows no problems or only one or two minor ones , we believe that you can consider the wiring safe ( after any minor problems are fixed ) . If there are signs of problems in many places , we suggest you look elsewhere . Here 's some hints on what to look for : Obvious non-code wiring can include : - Zip cord wiring , either concealed or nailed to walls - Hot wiring on the identified ( neutral ) conductor without proper marking . - Ungrounded grounding outlets ( except when downstream of a GFCI ) - Splices hanging in mid-air ( other than proper knob-and-tube ) - Switched neutrals - Unsecured Romex swinging about like grapevines Certain wiring practises that are actually to code ( or were at one time ) sometimes reveal DIY wiring that may have hidden violations : - Switches that seem to control nothing ( abandoned , perhaps not properly terminated wiring ) - A wall switch that shuts off a group of lights that are separately controlled by other wall switches . ( except when it 's *really* convenient ; - ) - Switches and outlets in bizarre locations - Great numbers of junction boxes without outlets or lamps - Junction boxes with great numbers of wires going into them - Wiring that passes through a closet instead of a wall or ceiling - Backwrapped grounding wires Subject : What is this weird stuff ? Old style wiring In the years since Edison `` invented '' electricity , several different wiring `` styles '' have come and gone . When you buy an older home you may encounter some of this stuff . This section describes the old methods , and some of their idiosyncrasies . The oldest wiring system you 're likely to encounter is called '' knob and tube '' ( K & T ) . It is made up of individual conductors with a cloth insulation . The wires are run along side structural members ( eg : joists or studs ) using ceramic stand-offs ( knobs ) . Wire is run through structural members using ceramic tubes . Connections were made by twisting the wire together , soldering , and wrapping with tape . Since the hot and neutral were run separately , the wiring tends to be rather confusing . A neutral often runs down the centre of each room , with `` taps '' off to each fixture . The hot wire tended to run from one fixture to the next . In some cases K & T is n't colour-coded , so the neutral is often the same colour as the hot wires . You 'll see K & T in homes built as late as the 40 's . Comments on K & T : - the people installing K & T were pretty paranoid about electricity , so the workmanship tends to be pretty good . - The wire , insulation and insulators tend to stand up very well . Most K & T I 've seen , for example , is in quite good condition . - No grounding . Grounding is usually difficult to install . - boxes are small . Receptacle replacement ( particularly with GFCI ) can be difficult . No bushing on boxes either , so wiring changes need special attention to box entry . - Sometimes the neutral is n't balanced very well between separately hot circuits , so it is sometimes possible to overload the neutral without exceeding the fusing on any circuit . - Building code does not permit insulation in walls that contain K & T . - Connection to existing K & T from new circuits can be tricky . Consult your inspector . - Modern wiring practise requires considerably more outlets to be installed than K & T systems did . Since K & T tends to be in pretty decent condition it generally isn't necessary to replace it simply because it 's K & T . What you should watch out for is renovations that have interfered with it and be cautious about circuit loading . In many cases it 's perfectly reasonable to leave existing K & T alone , and add new fixtures on new circuits using modern techniques . After K & T , they invented multi-conductor cable . The first type you will see is roughly a cloth and varnish insulation . It looks much like the romex cable of the last decade or two . This stuff was used in the 40 's and 50 's . Again , no grounding conductor . It was installed much like modern wiring . Its major drawback is that this type of insulation embrittles . We 've seen whole systems where the insulation would fracture and fall off at a touch . BX cable of the same vintage has similar problems . This stuff is very fragile , and becomes rather hazardous if the wires become bare . This wiring should be left untouched as much as possible - whenever an opportunity arises , replace it . A simple receptacle or switch replacement can turn into a several hour long frustrating fight with electrical tape or heat-shrink tubing . After this wiring technique , the more modern romex was invented . It 's almost a asphalt impregnated cloth . Often a bit sticky . This stuff stands up reasonably well and does n't present a hazard and is reasonably easy to work with . It does not need to be replaced - it should be considered as safe as the `` modern '' stuff - thermoplastic insulation wire . Just do n't abuse it too much . Subject : Where do I buy stuff ? Try to find a proper electrical supply outlet near you . Their prices will often be considerably better than chain hardware stores or DIY centres , have better quality materials , have wider variety including the `` odd '' stuff , and have people behind the counter that know what you 're talking about . Cultivate friendly knowledgeable sales people . They 'll give you much valuable information . -- Chris Lewis ; clewis @ ferret.ocunix.on.ca ; Phone : Canada 613 832-0541 Psroff 3.0 info : psroff-request @ ferret.ocunix.on.ca Ferret list : ferret-request @ ferret.ocunix.on.ca

[ Note : I just tried to figure this stuff out about a month ago myself , from various people on the net , so I could be wrong . ] The data is only ever read once ( barring mistracks and such , of course ) , and eventually gets turned into 44.1 KHz , 16 bit , two channel data . Oversampling takes two discrete data points , and interpolates n-1 points between them for n times oversampling . When I asked , people said that the interpolation was not simply linear interpolation , but significantly more complicated . Anyway , then , the purpose of oversampling is to move the `` effective '' sampling rate up to n times 44.1 KHz , in order to use higher frequency antialiasing filters . For the same quality filter , higher oversampling lets you build cheaper filters , whereas for the same price filter , higher oversamplings lets you build better filters . So , assuming the quality of all other components in a CD player remained the same , oversampling should allow a manufacturer to produce _slightly_ better sound due to anti-alias filtering . -- -Joel Kolstad

( it was ) On her next visit , my wife asked another doctor in the office if they read the ultrasounds themselves or if they had a radiologist read the pictures . The doctor very vehemently insisted that they were qualified to read the ultrasound and radiologists were NOT ! My wife is concerned about this . She saw a TV show a couple months back ( something like 20/20 or Dateline NBC , etc . ) where an expert on fetal ultrasounds ( a radiologist ) was showing all the different deffects that could be detected using the ultrasound . Should my wife be concerned ? Should we take the pictures to a radiologist for a second opinion ? ( and if so , where would we find such an expert in Chicago ? ) We do n't really have any special medical reason to be concerned , but if a radiologist will be able to see things the ob-gyn ca n't , then I do n't see why we should n't use one .

It implies that they have souls , but it does not say they > have souls . And it is not given that the quote above is given a high > priority in all interpretations . One must approach the Qur'an with intelligence . Any thinking approach to the Qur'an can not but interpret the above verse and others like it that women and men are spiritual equals . I think that the above verse does clearly imply that women have souls . Does it make any sense for something without a soul to be forgiven ? Or to have a great reward ( understood to be in the after-life ) ? I think the usual answer would be no -- in which case , the part saying `` For them has God prepared forgiveness and a great reward '' says they have souls . ( If it makes sense to say that things without souls can be forgiven , then I have no idea _what_ a soul is . ) As for your saying that the quote above may not be given a high priority in all interpretations , any thinking approach to the Qur'an has to give all verses of the Qur'an equal priority . That is because , according to Muslim belief , the _whole_ Qur'an is the revelation of God -- in fact , denying the truth of any part of the Qur'an is sufficient to be considered a disbeliever in Islam . > Quite similar to you other post , even when the Quran does not encourage > slavery , it is not justified to say that iit forbids or puts an end to > slavery . It is a non sequitur . Look , any approach to the Qur'an must be done with intelligence and thought . It is in this fashion that one can try to understand the Quran 's message . In a book of finite length , it can not explicitly answer every question you want to put to it , but through its teachings it can guide you . I think , however , that women are the spiritual equals of men is clearly and unambiguously implied in the above verse , and that since women can clearly be `` forgiven '' and `` rewarded '' they _must_ have souls ( from the above verse ) . Let 's try to understand what the Qur'an is trying to teach , rather than try to see how many ways it can be misinterpreted by ignoring this passage or that passage . The misinterpretations of the Qur'an based on ignoring this verse or that verse are infinite , but the interpretations fully consistent are more limited . Let 's try to discuss these interpretations consistent with the text rather than how people can ignore this bit or that bit , for that is just showing how people can try to twist Islam for their own ends -- something I do not deny -- but provides no reflection on the true teachings of Islam whatsoever .

The village I described was actually the closest I could come to describing mine . I agree there may be other villages where the civilian population has deserted because it is too close to Israeli lines and thus gets bombed more often . In such villages often the only remaining inhabitants are guerillas and some elderly who have nowhere else to go . But for the most part the typical South Lebanon village is more like mine . One where civilians and guerillas live together . They are often inhabiting the same house . Many families are large , some have members of the families involved in Hizollah , most others are not . That is what is so hard of South Lebanon , Israel is not fighting an army with well drawn battle lines , but a guerilla tyoe resistance which by definition and necessity blends with the local populace . Not because they are evil cowards that use women and children as shields , but because that is the only way one can fight a more powerful better equipped occupying army . | > Some of the villages , and yours might well be among them , are as you | > describe . Not all are . There are a large number of groups in the area , | > backed by various organizations , with a wide range of purposes . Hizbollah | > and Amal were two of the larger ones and may still be . Hizbollah and Amal are now the main two militias . Though Hizbollah people tend to be more committed to resistrance operation and better motivated by religious conviction . As to retaliation , | > while mistakes may be made , that is still a far cry from indiscriminate | > bombing , which would have produced major casualties . It may be a mixture of what we both say . Sometimes Israel chooses its targets carefully . At other times it just sends its pilots on sorties aimed at a town in general since it only knows that the attackers came from that specific village but has no further intelligence . On several occasions Israel retalliated against civilian refugee camps , even in North Lebanon , just to show that it will not sit idly after its soldiers have been attacked . Most of the time it directs the SLA to do the dirty work and indiscriminately shell some Lebanese villages on the other side . I have experienced this shelling myself on several occasions , this is why the SLA militia is sometimes even more despised than Israeli troops . | | > Well , here we disagree . I think that Israel would willingly withdraw if | > the Lebanese gov't was able to field a reliable force in the area to police | > it and prevent further attacks . I hope you are right on Israeli willingness to withdraw , but I still contend that withdrawal would be the better course for Israel's security , since it would reduce its military losses , and I claim that the Lebanese and Syrian gov'ts would be able to prevent any further attacks on Northern Israel . | > There seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese | > goovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such | > circumstances , and now the Lebanese government has proven that it is | > capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did | > in all other parts of Lebanon . | > | > No , the Syrian gov't is more than happy to have Israel sink into another | > Lebanese morass . I could elaborate if necessary . Hmm ... Here we disagree on what serves Syria interests better . I think Syria wants to have Lebanon all to itself . It would be willing to guarantee Northern Israel 's security in return for Israeli withdrawal . I do n't think Syria wants Israel to be involved in its protectorate of Lebanon . Syria is sitting at the negotiating table because it has come to accept that and wants to get a political resolution . A renewal of hostilities along the Lebanese front could put the whole ME peace negotiations back in question . | > I agree , only in the case of the Isareli soldiers their killing | > CAN NOT be qualified as murder , no matter what you say . | > | > No , but it is regretable , as is the whole situation .

The user can choose a new session key K_P for each phone call P he makes . Chip C knows three keys : G , its own U_C , and the user 's K_P . The government as a whole knows G and every U_C . Apparently a message M is encrypted as E_G ( E_ { U_C } ( K_P ) , C ) , E_ { K_P } ( M ) . That 's it . The system as described here ca n't possibly work . What happens when someone plugs the above ciphertext into a receiving chip ? To get M the receiving chip needs K_P ; to get K_P the receiving chip needs U_C . The only information it can work with is C. If U_C can be computed from C then the system is cryptographically useless and the `` key escrow '' is bullshit .

In normal condition , the concentration of glutamate in the cerebrospinal fluid is about 2 uM that is high enough to activate one type of glutamate receptor-the NMDA receptor . But the question is Neuron and glial cell in the brain have a lots of transport to get glutamate into Neuron or glial . So no one know exact concentration of glutamate is around neurons . Glutamate is most important neurotransmitter in the central nervous system . It is involved in not only in daily life like the controling of movement , it is alsoinvolved in develpoment , memory and learn ( it is involved in Logn-term potentialtion that be thought is the basis of learning ) .

Lines : 7 A while back someone had several equations which could be used for changing 3 f iltered grey scale images into one true color image . This is possible because it 's the same theory used by most color scanners . I am not looking for the obv ious solution which is to buy a color scanner but what I do need is those equat ions becasue I am starting to write software which will automate the conversion process . I would really appreciate it if someone would repost the 3 equations /3 unknowns . Thanks for the help ! ! !

The phenomenon is most > certainly a real one . OK , I 've asked this before , and with a new thread on these lines , I ask this again : 1 : If a large hole current is run thru a resistor , will there be I^2 * R cooling instead of heating ? 2 : Can anyone design an amplifier that preferentially amplifies hole currents over normal electron currents ? 3 : what semiconductor materials have the highest ratio of hole mobility to electron mobility ? ( please quote actual test samples rather than estimates based on theory . Also , do n't be limited to semiconductors : consider also insulators , resistors , dielectrics , piezo-electrics , conductors , magnets ( metal , ceramic ) , magnetostrictives , etc ) . NOTES : to summarize , this thread has so far stated that the only area where holes are not detectable is the vacuum . That is , hole particles only exist in the presence of matter . Previous threads have stated that holes only exist in certain semi-conductors . The question that naturally arises is if the hole currents inside a semi-conductor vanish at the point where the semiconductor is joined to a conductor ( say , copper ) . I do n't want a theoretical discussion here about whether holes could exist inside metal conductors , rather I ask for an experimental discussion on how to amplify and detect such currents *if* they exist . Also note that I have cross-posted this to sci.electronics since this is now becoming an electronic discussion . Thanx , Eric . -- -- ET `` A Force of Nature '' -- --

I have a document which I believe refutes the notion that the SSPX ( Society of Saint Pius X ) is in schism , or that there has been any legitimate excommunication . If anyone is interested in reading the truth about this matter please email me and I 'll send them the document via email . Its 26 pages long , so I wont be posting it on the news group .

Paper : Zman Tel Aviv ( Tel Aviv 's time ) . Friday local Tel Aviv's paper , affiliated with Maariv . Date : 19 February 1993 Journalist : Guy Ehrlich Subject : Interview with soldiers who served in the Duvdevan ( Cherry ) units , which disguise themselves as Arabs and operate within the occupied territories . Excerpts from the article : '' A lot has been written about the units who disguise themselves as Arabs , things good and bad , some of the falsehoods . But the most important problem of those units has been hardly dealt with . It is that everyone who serves in the Cherry , after a time goes in one way or another insane '' . A man who said this , who will here be called Danny ( his full name is known to the editors ) served in the Cherry . After his discharge from the army he works as delivery boy . His pal , who will here be called Dudu was also serving in the Cherry , and is now about to depart for a round-the-world tour . They both look no different from average Israeli youngsters freshly discharged from conscript service . But in their souls , one can notice something completely different ... .It was not easy for them to come out with disclosures about what happened to them . And they think that to most of their fellows from the Cherry it wound n't be easy either . Yet after they began to talk , it was nearly impossible to make them stop talking . The following article will contain all the horror stories recounted with an appalling openness . ( ... ) A short time ago I was in command of a veteran team , in which some of the fellows applied for release from the Cherry . We called such soldiers H.I . 'Hit by the Intifada ' . Under my command was a soldier who talked to himself non-stop , which is a common phenomenon in the Cherry . I sent him to a psychiatrist . But why I should talk about others when I myself feel quite insane ? On Fridays , when I come home , my parents know I can not be talked to until I go to the beach , surf a little , calm down and return . The keys of my father 's car must be ready for in advance , so that I can go there . I they dare talk to me before , or whenever I don't want them to talk to me , I just grab a chair and smash it instantly . I know it is my nerve : Smashing chairs all the time and then running away from home , to the car and to the beach . Only there I become normal. ( ... ) ( ... ) Another friday I was eating a lunch prepared by my mother . It was an omelette of sorts . She took the risk of sitting next to me and talking to me . I then told my mother about an event which was still fresh in my mind . I told her how I shot an Arab , and how exactly his wound looked like when I went to inspect it . She began to laugh hysterically . I wanted her to cry , and she dared laugh straight in my face instead ! So I told her how my pal had made a mincemeat of the two Arabs who were preparing the Molotov cocktails . He shot them down , hitting them beautifully , exactly as they deserved . One bullet had set a Molotov cocktail on fire , with the effect that the Arab was burning all over , just beautifully . I was delighted to see it . My pal fired three bullets , two at the Arab with the Molotov cocktail , and the third at his chum . It hit him straight in his ass . We both felt that we 'd pulled off something . Next I told my mother how another pal of mine split open the guts in the belly of another Arab and how all of us ran toward that spot to take a look . I reached the spot first . And then that Arab , blood gushing forth from his body , spits at me . I yelled : 'Shut up ' and he dared talk back to me in Hebrew ! So I just laughed straight in his face . I am usually laughing when I stare at something convulsing right before my eyes . Then I told him : 'All right , wait a moment ' . I left him in order to take a look at another wounded Arab . I asked a soldier if that Arab could be saved , if the bleeding from his artery could be stopped with the help of a stone of something else like that . I keep telling all this to my mother , with details , and she keeps laughing straight into my face . This infuriated me . I got very angry , because I felt I was becoming mad . So I stopped eating , seized the plate with he omelette and some trimmings still on , and at once threw it over her head . Only then she stopped laughing . At first she did n't know what to say . ( ... ) But I must tell you of a still other madness which falls upon us frequently . I went with a friend to practice shooting on a field . A gull appeared right in the middle of the field . My friend shot it at once . Then we noticed four deer standing high up on the hill above us . My friend at once aimed at one of them and shot it . We enjoyed the sight of it falling down the rock . We shot down two deer more and went to take a look . When we climbed the rocks we saw a young deer , badly wounded by our bullet , but still trying to such some milk from its already dead mother . We carefully inspected two paths , covered by blood and chunks of torn flesh of the two deer we had hit . We were just delighted by that sight . We had hit'em so good ! Then we decided to kill the young deer too , so as spare it further suffering . I approached , took out my revolver and shot him in the head several times from a very short distance . When you shoot straight at the head you actually see the bullets sinking in . But my fifth bullet made its brains fall outside onto the ground , with the effect of splattering lots of blood straight on us . This made us feel cured of the spurt of our madness . Standing there soaked with blood , we felt we were like beasts of prey . We could n't explain what had happened to us . We were almost in tears while walking down from that hill , and we felt the whole day very badly . ( ... ) We always go back to places we carried out assignments in . This is why we can see them . When you see a guy you disabled , may be for the rest of his life , you feel you got power . You feel Godlike of sorts . '' ( ... ) Both Danny and Dudu contemplate at least at this moment studying the acting . Dudu is not willing to work in any security-linked occupation . Danny feels the exact opposite . 'Why should n't I take advantage of the skills I have mastered so well ? Why should n't I earn $ 3.000 for each chopped head I would deliver while being a mercenary in South Africa ? This kind of job suits me perfectly . I have no human emotions any more . If I get a reasonable salary I will have no problem to board a plane to Bosnia in order to fight there .

I can just see it . You need to slow > down on a downgrade , so you hit the push to talk button . Now , that indeed is possible . A good friend of mine is running about 1 KW PeP from his car . Yes , he does have a second alternator . Yes , he calls the rig an `` electronic brake '' since the engine noticeably slows when the key is down . My car , unfortunately , has so much computer junk under the hood that it's astonishingly sensitive to RFI . If I key a 2W HT over the engine with the hood open , the car loses timing due to the RF leaking into the distributor pickup . Very poor design . I will , however , point out that ham radio operators are usually quite willing to help when interference is detected . Remember that any interference is wasted power ; if I put out 1W in the TV band , that 's 1W that I am not putting out in the band I am trying to transmit on , and 1W can often be the difference between a nice card hanging on the wall , and nothing . CBers , however , are usually not as helpful . Most illegal CBers , however , will stop operation when you inform them of a problem . The rest of them will stop operation when you inform the local FCC office of the problem ( in writing , and giving details and addresses ) . > Last , you can usually tell ham radio vs. CB .

Good advice . Hams will frequently give their call , and will never use a `` handle .

From : brifre1 @ ac.dal.ca Subject : European expansion and our f*cked system Organization : Dalhousie University , Halifax , Nova Scotia , Canada Lines : 36 Everyone keeps talking about European expansion by 2010 thinking wishful thoughts , but being totally off the ball . The league format we use here is incompatible with that in Europe . ( for those that do n't know , the best teams from lower divisions get promoted and the worst get demoted ) . Would European fans put up with our `` if you 've paid , you can play '' attitude ? ? How long would they support teams that are run on Ranger-based corporate thinking ( I use the term lightly ) . ( We do n't need a good product because these duffuses in NYC would fill the arena for Ottawa's record every year ... ... 1940 ! ! haha ( sorry , had ta say it ) ) . If hockey ( and other pro sports ) had a similar system to Europe , maybe teams like the Rangers would be forced to compete ( or get demoted the fourth division ) . We 'd have many more teams ... centres that are n't as big ( like Halifax or Adirondack ... .ok , so Halifax is n't a good example ) would eventually get promoted , and every team would be somewhat competetive within its own division ( unlike Ottawa , SJ , Edmonton , etc. ) . Fans would eventually get rewarded for their loyalty ( or penalized for their neglect ) , and the league would be more interesting and dynamic every year because of the influx of newly promoted teams ( and the Halifax Citadels win the Stanley Cup ... I can dream , ca n't I ? ? ) Look at British ( or any European ) soccer as an example ( they never have fan problems ) . Just someone who thinks our system really sucks Barfly ( feel free to flame me , my account ends today ... hahahaha ) 1940 ! !

I may be interesting to see some brief selections posted to the net . My understanding is that SSPX does not consider ITSELF in schism or legitimately excommunicated .

Specifically , the amount of freely available Glu in mother 's milk versus commercial baby foods , vs. typical lunch items from the Standard American Diet such as packaged soup mixes .

From : tpd6908 @ yak.COM ( Tom Dickens ) Subject : Re : iisi clock upgrades Organization : Boeing Computer Services Lines : 22 I too have been watching the IIsi speedup reports and plan to upgrade in the next few weeks . The plan I have is to build a small board with a few different crystals on it and to be able to switch between the different speeds using a front pannel switch . This way I can get the speed when I want but I can also run at slower ( stock ) speeds it I experience any compatability problems with any applications . I do n't expect to be able to switch clock speeds with the system running , but if I can switch without any lock-up problems , then I could switch to 33MHz when needed and put it back to idle ( 20 MHz ) when not needeed . This would further reduce the wear-and-tear on the CPU even with a heat sink . Of course I would not want to run the different clock signals through the switch but use a chip or two on the board to select the frequency desired and route it directly to the mother board . I have n't started probing around inside my si yet . Does anyone know the voltage level to power the crystal oscilators ? Thanks . < < < Tom Dickens : Boeing Computer Services tpd6908 @ yak.ca.boeing.com > > > < < < These statements are mine and not Boeing 's > > >

In practice , communism has `` solved '' the problem by killing off anybody who is _too_ productive , and who therefore raises embarrassing questions about why the rest of the group is a bunch of sluggards . The mass butchery of `` kulaks '' in the USSR is a good instance of this . A poor second best is to have a neighboring capitalist country to which people of politically incorrect skill and ambition flee . I often wonder just what Castro would have done if the Cubans presently in Miami would have been forced to remain in Cuba . Would they have revolted and killed him off , or been killed ? Best of all is to build a wall locking the citizens of your country in , load it up so heavily with attack dogs , barbed wire , and land mines that most people fleeing over it die , and then give everyone the choice of obedience , prison , or flight . This would be a bad science-fiction novel , if the East Germans had n't actually done it . The last person to die crossing the wall , as I recall , was an unarmed woman who was shot in the back .

I was part of a study a few years ago at the University of Arizona to see whether cross dominant individuals ( those with a particular handedness but who had dominance in the opposite eye ) were better hitters than those with same side dominance of hand and eye . I was picked from my softball class because I was cross dominant ( right hand , left eye ) which put me in a small minority ( and the grad student was trying to get an equal number of cross dominant and same side dominant people ) . To control the study , she used a pitching machine - fast pitch . Since I was used to slow pitch , I did n't come close ( actually I think I foul tipped a few ) to hitting the ball . If there were a lot of people like me in her study ( i.e. , those who ca n't hit fast pitch , or are not used to hitting off a machine ) , I would seriously question the results of that study ! ! I think there have been some studies of major league players ( across a fairly large cross section of players ) to test whether eye dominance being the same or opposite side was `` better '' - but I do n't know the results . ( The woman who ran the study I was in said that there was a higher incidence of crossdominance in major leaguers than across the general population - but I 'm not sure whether I 'd believe her . ) Janice Rathmann

From : jamshid @ cgl.ucsf.edu ( J. Naghizadeh ) Subject : PR Campaign Against Iran ( PBS Frontline ) Organization : Computer Graphics Laboratory , UCSF Lines : 51 Originator : jamshid @ socrates.ucsf.edu There have been a number of articles on the PBS frontline program about Iranian bomb . Here is my $ 0.02 on this and related subjects . One is curious to know the real reasons behind this and related public relations campaign about Iran in recent months . These include : 1 ) Attempts to implicate Iran in the bombing of the New York Trade Center . Despite great efforts in this direction they have not succeeded in this . They , however , have indirectly created the impression that Iran is behind the rise of fundamentalist Islamic movements and thus are indirectly implicated in this matter . 2 ) Public statements by the Secretary of State Christoffer and other official sources regarding Iran being a terrorist and outlaw state . 3 ) And finally the recent broadcast of the Frontline program . I suspect that this PR campaign against Iran will continue and perhaps intensify . Why this increased pressure on Iran ? A number of factors may have been behind this . These include : 1 ) The rise of Islamic movements in North-Africa and radical Hamas movement in the Israeli occupied territories . This movement is basically anti-western and is not necessarily fueled by Iran . The cause for accelerated pace of this movement is probably the Gulf War which sought to return colonial Shieks and Amirs to their throne in the name of democracy and freedom . Also , the obvious support of Algerian military coup against the democratically elected Algerian Islamic Front which clearly exposed the democracy myth . A further cause of this may be the daily broadcast of the news on the slaughter of Bosnian Moslems . 2 ) Possible future implications of this movement in Saudi Arabia and other US client states and endangerment of the cheap oil sources from this region . 3 ) A need to create an enemy as an excuse for huge defense expenditures . This has become necessary after the demise of Soveit Union . The recent PR campaign against Iran , however , seems to be directed from Israel rather than Washington . There is no fundamental conflict of interest between Iran and the US and in my opinion , it is in the interest of both countries to affect reestablishment of normal and friendly relations . This may have a moderating effect on the rise of radical movements within the Islamic world and Iran . -- jamshid

Ruegg ) Subject : Re : Eugenics Keywords : gene pool ; wisdom ; virtue Nntp-Posting-Host : naples.med.unc.edu Organization : UNC-CH School of Medicine Lines : 84 Subject : Re : Eugenics ( Gordon Banks ) writes : / ; Probably within 50 years , a new type of eugenics will be possible . ; Maybe even sooner . We are now mapping the human genome . We will ; then start to work on manipulation of that genome . Using genetic ; engineering , we will be able to insert whatever genes we want . ; No breeding , no `` hybrids '' , etc . The ethical question is , should ; we ? Two past problems with eugenics have been 1 ) reducing the gene pool and 2 ) defining the status of the eugenized . Inserting genes would not seem to reduce the gene pool unless the inserted genes later became transmissible to progeny . Then they may be able to crowd out `` garbage genes . '' This may in the future become possible . Even if it does , awareness of the need to maintain the gene pool would hopefully mean provisions will be made for saving genes that may come in handy later . Evidently the genes for sickle cell disease in equatorial Africa and for diabetes in the Hopi *promoted* survival in some conditions . We do n't really know what the future may hold for our environment . The reduced wilderness- and disease-survival capacity of our relatively inbred domesticated animals comes to mind . Vulcanism , nuclear winter , ice age , meteor impact , new microbiological threats , famine , global warming , etc. , etc. , are all conceivable . Therefore , having as many genes as possible available is a good strategy for species survival . Of course , the status of genetically altered individuals would start out as no different than anyone else 's . But if we could make '' philosopher-kings '' with great bodies and long lives , would we ( or they ) want to give them elevated status ? We could . The Romans did it with their kings *without* the benefits of such eugenics . The race eventually realized and dealt with the problems which that caused , but for a while , it was a problem . Orwell introduced us to the notion of what might happen to persons genetically altered for more menial tasks . But there is nothing new under the sun . We treated slaves the same way for millennia before '' 1984 . '' I see no inherent problem with gene therapy which avoids at least these 2 problems . Humans have always had trouble having the virtue and wisdom to use any power that falls into their hands to good ends all the time . That has n't stopped the race as a whole yet . Many are the civilizations which have died from inability to adapt to environmental change . However , also many are the civilizations which have died from the abuse of their own power . The ones which survived have hopefully learned a lesson from the fates of others , and have survived by making better choices when their turns came . Not that I do n't think that this gene altering power could n't wipe us off the face of the earth or cause endless suffering . Nuclear power or global warming or whatever could and may still do that , too . The real issue is an issue of wisdom and virtue . I personally do n't think man has enough wisdom and virtue to pull this next challenge off any better than he did the for last few . We , as eugenists , may make it , an we may not . If we do n't , I hope there are reservoirs of `` garbage '' people out in some backwater with otherwise long discarded `` garbage '' genes which will pull us through . I believe that the real problem is and will probably always be the same . Man needs to accept input from the great spirit of God to overcome his lacks in the area of knowing how to use the power he has . Some men have , and I believe all men may , listen to and obey the still small voice of God in their hearts . This is the way to begin to recieve the wisdom and virtue needed to escape the problems consequent to poor choices . Peoples have died out for many reasons . The societies which failed to accept enough input from God to safely use the power they had developed have destroyed themselves , and often others in the process . It is self-evident that the ones which survive today have either accepted enough input from the Spirit to use their powers wisely enough to avoid or survive their own mistakes thus far , or else have n't had enough power for long enough . In summary , I would say that the question of whether to use this new technology is really an ancient one . And the answer , in some ways hard , in some ways easy , is the same ancient answer . It is n't the power , it is the Spirit . Sorry for the long post . Got carried away . Bob ( ruegg @ med.unc.edu )

Please list the names of some of those neutral reporters that were killed in the `` O.T. '' . It is also interesting to note that at the outbreak of the intifada , palestinian parties quickly began orchestrating their demonstrations for the benefit of the media . Having spoken to a Danish reporter who covered the initfada , I know of at least one case where he found out that a `` mass demonstration '' on the outskirts of Gaza was setup for himself and his colleagues . When I asked whether the footage shot was sent he replied affirmatively , `` after all , it did happen .

However , I 'm wondering how one goes about learning to ride the bike proficiently enough so as to a ) get a liscence and b ) not kill oneself . I do n't know anyone with a bike who could teach me , and the most advice I 've heard is either `` do you live near a field '' or `` do you have a friend with a pickup truck '' , the answers to both of which are NO . Do I just ride around my neighborhood and hope for the best ? I kind of live in a residential area but it 's not suburbs .

From : shd2001 @ andy.bgsu.edu ( Sherlette Dixon ) Subject : Was Jesus Black ? Organization : BGSU Lines : 43 The people who post to this particular newsgroup are either too cowardly , too arrogant , or too apathetic to discuss this issue since I have yet to see any discussion grace my computer screen . While it holds PARTICULAR interest to the African-American community , everyone has something to gain from discussing it . As any knowledgable person should know , Christianity has been used in this country to tighten the spiritual , emotional , & mental hold slavery placed on the minds , souls & hearts of African-Americans . This was most effectively done by the display of white icons of Jesus in slave churches to encourage the godly superiority of slaveowners . It was n't enough that the slaveowner was your provider , but he was also your GOD , to be looked upon with unconditional love & loyalty and to be worshipped with great pride . But how culturally & biblically accurate are these icons ? Pictures & statues of a Black Jesus have been found in European countries , as that of a Black Madonna . But what about Biblical physical descriptions of Jesus , His hair being compared to that of wool , His feet to that of brass ? And think about the area of the world where all Biblical actions took place . I welcome all intelligent commentary on this important topic ; flamers need not reply . Sherlette P.S . I expect at least THIS type of response : `` It does n't matter what color His skin was ; His actions & what He did for mankind are what counts . '' This is true ; I am not questioning this . But He walked the earth for 3 decades as a HUMAN ; this part of His existence intrigues me . And as for saying that `` it does n't matter ... '' to a member of a physically emancipated people who is still struggling for MENTAL emancipation , believe me : IT MATTERS . [ The general attack on the members of this group seems unjustified . There has been discussion of this issue in the past . We ca n't discuss everything at once , so the fact that some specific thing has n't been discussed recently should n't be taken as a sign of general cowardice , arrogance or apathy . In past discussions no one has been outraged by suggestions that Jesus could be black ( and it has been suggested by a few scholars ) , but the concensus is that he was most likely Semitic . As you probably know , there is a tradition that portrayals of Jesus in art tends to show him as one of the people . Thus you would n't be surprised to find African art showing him as black , and oriental art showing him as oriental . There are good reasons relating to Christian devotion to think of him in such a way . It 's also good now and then to have that image challenged , and to think of Jesus as being a member of XXX , where XXX is the group you least respect . -- clh ]

Center for Regional Studies Lines : 145 The Orders for the Turkish Extermination of the Armenians # 17 To the children of genocide : `` Send them away into the Desert '' This is part of a continuing series of articles containing official Turkish wartime ( WW1 ) governmental telegrams , in translation , entailing the orders for the extermination of the Armenian people in Turkey . Generally , these telegrams were issued by the Turkish Minister of the Interior , Talaat Pasha , for example , we have the following set regarding children : '' To the Government of Aleppo . November 5 , 1915 . We are informed that the little ones belonging to the Armenians from Sivas , Mamuret-ul-Aziz , Diarbekir and Erzeroum [ hundreds of km distance from Aleppo ] are adopted by certain Moslem families and received as servants when they are left alone through the death of their parents . We inform you that you are to collect all such children in your province and send them to the places of deportation , and also to give the necessary orders regarding this to the people . Minister of the Interior , Talaat '' [ 1 ] '' To the Government of Aleppo . September 21 , 1915 . There is no need for an orphanage . It is not the time to give way to sentiment and feed the orphans , prolonging their lives . Send them away to the desert and inform us . Minister of the Interior , Talaat '' [ 2 ] '' To the General Committee for settling and deportees . November 26 , 1915 . There were more than four hundred children in the orphanage . They will be added to the caravans and sent to their places of exile . Abdullahad Nuri . [ 3 ] '' To the Government of Aleppo . January 15 , 1916 . We hear that certain orphanages which have been opened receive also the children of the Armenians . Whether this is done through the ignorance of our real purpose , or through contempt of it , the Government will regard the feeding of such children or any attempt to prolong their lives as an act entirely opposed to it purpose , since it considers the survival of these children as detrimental . I recommend that such children shall not be received into the orphanages , and no attempts are to be made to establish special orphanages for them . Minister of the Interior , Talaat . '' [ 4 ] '' To the Government of Aleppo . Collect and keep only those orphans who can not remember the tortures to which their parents have been subjected . Send the rest away with the caravans . Minister of the Interior , Talaat '' [ 5 ] '' From the Ministry of the Interior to the Government of Aleppo . At a time when there are thousands of Moslem refugees and the widows of Shekid [ fallen soldiers ] are in need of food and protection , it is not expedient to incur extra expenses by feeding the children left by Armenians , who will serve no purpose except that of giving trouble in the future . It is necessary that these children should be turned out of your vilayet and sent with the caravans to the place of deportation . Those that have been kept till now are also to be sent away , in compliance with our previous orders , to Sivas . Minister of the Interior , Talaat '' [ 6 ] In 1926 , Halide Edip ( a pioneer Turkish nationalist ) wrote in her memoirs about a conversation with Talaat Pasha , verifying and `` rationalizing '' this ultra-national fascist anti-Armenian mentality , the following : '' I have the conviction that as long as a nation does the best for its own interest , and succeeds , the world admires it and thinks it moral . I am ready to die for what I have done , and I know I shall die for it . '' [ 7 ] These telegrams were entered as unquestioned evidence during the 1923 trial of Talaat Pasha 's , assassin , Soghomon Tehlerian . The Turkish government never questioned these `` death march orders '' until 1986 , during a time when the world was again reminded of the genocide of the Armenians . For reasons known to those who study the psychology of genocide denial , the Turkish government and their supporters in crime deny that such orders were ever issued , and further claim that these telegrams were forgeries based on a study by S. Orel and S. Yuca of the Turkish Historical Society . If one were to examine the sample `` authentic text '' provided in the Turkish Historical Society study and use their same forgery test on that sample , it too would be a forgery ! . In fact , if any of the tests delineated by the Turkish Historical Society are performed an any piece of Ottoman Turkish or Persian/Arabic script , one finds that anything handwritten in such language is a forgery . Today , the body of Talaat Pasha lies in a tomb on Liberty Hill , Istanbul , Turkey , just next to the Yildiz University campus . The body of this genocide architect was returned to Turkey from Germany during WW2 when Turkey was in a heightened state of proto-fascism . Recently , this monument has served as a focal point for anti-Armenianism in Turkey . This monument represents the epitome of the Turkish government 's pathological denial of a clear historical event and is an insult to a people whose only crime was to be born Armenian . - - - references - - - [ 1 ] _The Memoirs of Naim Bey_ , Aram Andonian , 1919 , pages 59-60 [ 2 ] ibid , page 60 [ 3 ] ibid , page 60 [ 4 ] ibid , page 61 [ 5 ] ibid , page 61 [ 6 ] ibid , page 62 [ 7 ] _Memoirs of Halide Edip_ , Halide Edip , The Century Press , New York ( and London ) , 1926 , page 387 -- David Davidian dbd @ urartu.sdpa.org | `` How do we explain Turkish troops on S.D.P.A .

Good luck importing one -- They probably do n't meet US safety and pollution requirements . There are mechanics and junkyards which specialize in VW ; they might be helpful for finding a `` Thing '' unless the WWII re-enacters have grabbed them all . The WWII Kubelwagen was the German equivalent of the Jeep , but was not 4- wheel drive . One is on display at the Patton Museum at Fort Knox , Kentucky , also the rare `` Schwimwagen '' ( sp ? ) amphibious version , in full-scale dioramas .

From : jkatz @ access.digex.com ( Jordan Katz ) Subject : SSRT Roll-Out Speech Organization : Express Access Online Communications , Greenbelt , MD USA Lines : 101 Distribution : usa NNTP-Posting-Host : access.digex.net SSRT ROLLOUT Speech Delivered by Col. Simon P. Worden , The Deputy for Technology , SDIO Mcdonnell Douglas - Huntington Beach April 3,1993 Most of you , as am I , are `` children of the 1960 's . '' We grew up in an age of miracles -- Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles , nuclear energy , computers , flights to the moon . But these were miracles of our parent 's doing . For a decade and more the pundits have told us - `` you 've lost it ! '' The `` me '' generation is only living on the accomplishments of the past . You and I have even begun to believe the pessimists . We listen in awe as the past generation tells of its triumphs . Living history they are . We are privileged to hear those who did it tell of it . A few weeks ago some of this very team listened in awe as General Bernie Schriever told of his team 's work - and yes struggle - to build this nation 's Intercontinental Ballistic Missile . What stories can we tell ? Blurry-eyed telescopes ? Thousand dollar toilet seats ? Even our space launch vehicles hearken only of that past great time . They are and seem destined to remain Gen. Schriever 's ICBMs . I find it hard to swell with pride that the best new space-lifter idea is to refurbish old Minuteman and Poseidon ballistic missiles . Well - The pessimists are wrong . The legacy is continuing . This event is proof . To our technological parents : We 've listened to your stories . We 've caught your enthusiasm and can-do spirit . And we 've learned from your achievements - and your mistakes . Let me honor one of you who was part of that history and the impetus behind this history - Max Hunter . You are one of the greatest engineers of the firts great age of space exploration . Your insight and discipline built the Thor ICBM - later incorporated into today 's most successful launch vehicle - The Delta . You told us in the 60 's that a new form of launch vehicle - a single stage reusable rocket - can and should be built . You advocated this idea tirelessly . It was elegantly simple , as are all great breakthroughs . You showed us how to build it . You convinced us it could be done . You are working by our side to weld its components into place . Most important - you reminded us of a prime engineering principle - undoubtably one you learned from the generation before you - the generation that built transcontinental aviation in the 1920 's and 30 's - build a little and test a little and Max , you passed all of this on to people like Pat Ladner who started this program for the SDI . Douglas Aircraft did n't start with a DC-10 . They did n't even start with a DC-3 . Our grandfathers built a little , tested a little - even sold a little and made a little money - before they moved on to the next step . They did n't take a decade or more before putting the first `` rubber on the road . '' Max Hunter - you did n't take ten years to build Thor , and by God we 're not going to take ten years to show that low cost , single stage , reusable aerospace transportation is real . We ended the cold war in a few short years . It took the same team here today but a few years to show through the Strategic Defense Initiative that the cold war must end . We - you and us - launched a series of satellites - The Delta experiments - in about a year apiece . This , more than anything else signaled our commitment to end the impasse between ourselves and the Soviet Union . Those who made the decisions on both sides have underscored the importance of our work in bringing about a new international relationship . But it is the same team which is now putting in place the framework for an aerospace expansion that is our legacy for the next generation . We will make space access routine and affordable . We built this magnificent flying machine in two years . This summer a true rocket ship will take off and land on earth for the first time . Then we can and surely will build in the next three years a reusable sub-orbital rocket . It will allow us to use space rapidly , affordably , and efficiently as no other nation can . And yes - we 'll make a little money off it too ! Then - and only then - we 'll spend another three years to build a fully reusable single stage to orbit system . The DC-3 of space will be a reality ! We may even be able to use some of the rocket propulsion breakthroughs of our former cold war adversaries . What a wonderful irony if this SDI product and Russian efforts to counter SDI merge to power mankind 's next step to the stars ! To be sure , we must guard against the temptations to leap to the final answer . Robert Goddard 's first rockets were n't Saturn V 's ! If we succumb to the temptation to ask for just a few extra dollars and a few more years to jump immediately to a full orbital system - we will fail . Max Hunter and his colleagues showed the way . Three years and a cloud of dust - in our case rocket exhausts . There is no short-cut . If we expect to reshape the world again - we must do it one brick at a time . Minds on tasks at hand ! This project is real . The torch of American technological greatness is being passed . We are Americans . This machine is American . Let 's go fly it !

If I were n't a Christian , I would be an agnostic , but I have sufficient subjective evidence to justify and sustain my relationship with God . Again this is a matter of premises and assumptions . I assume that there is more to `` life , the universe and everything '' than materialism ; ie that spirituality exists . This assumption answers the question about why I have apparent spiritual needs . I find this assumption consistent with my subsequent observat- ions . I then find that God fills these spiritual needs . But I can not objectively prove the difference between apparent filling of imagined spiritual needs and real filling of real spiritual needs .

I bought my machine a couple of weeks ago as well and started to experience these problems . Apple Australia via my dealer said that this problem has a number of potential causes - Faulty applications , faulty third party hardware ( modems , memory etc ) , system software , PRAM corruption and power manager corruption , and the Duo hardware itself . None of the above are relevant in my case except the last two maybe ( no applications were running , the system software was re-installed , I have no additional hardware ) . I have found that clearing PRAM appears to help for a while at least ( hold down command option P and R on startup ) . Unfortunately the problem returns suggesting that PRAM is being corrupted by something ( system software bug ? - I do n't have any non-issue inits in my system ) . Apparently the Power Manager can be reset by `` holding the reset and interrupt buttons while powering up '' - Apple 's advice - but since the Duo does not have an interrupt button I 'm not sure what they mean in this case . This may also help if someone can decipher Apple 's advice for me . Beyond this Apple suggest that `` you should follow the technical procedures to check the hardware of this Duo '' . Since so many others appear to be having the same problem it would seem to me that there has been a system software bug introduced somewhere along the line - and quite recently too - since it only seems to be recent Duo 230 purchasers who have this problem .

And does the phone company require written , subpoena-able evidence of probable cause in order to process the request ? I suggest that the officer was disinterested in pursuing your case -- even if you could prove the offender had called you at a certain time , your chances of winning a harassment suit on the strength of this evidence are nil . My contact with several people who have dealt with cases of extreme phone harassment ( several thousand calls in one case ) teaches me that police in this area are quite lethargic about pursuing such matters .

God 's laws were originally written for the Israelites . Jesus changed that fact by now making the Law applicable to all people , not just the Jews . Gentiles could be part of the kingdom of Heaven through the saving grace of God . I never said that the Law was made obsolete by Jesus . If anything , He clarified the Law such as in that quote you made . In the following verses , Jesus takes several portions of the Law and expounds upon the Law giving clearer meaning to what God intended . If you 'll notice , He also reams into the Pharisees for mucking up the Law with their own contrived interpretations . They knew every letter of the Law and followed it with their heads but not their hearts . That is why He points out that our righteousness must surpass that of the Pharisees in order to be accepted into the kingdom of Heaven . People such as the Pharisees are those who really go out of their way to debate about the number of angels that can dance on the head of a pin . They had become legalistic , rule-makers - religious lawyers who practiced the letter of the Law but never really believed in it . I think you will agree with me that there are in today 's world , a lot of modern-day Pharisees who know the bible from end to end but do not believe in it . What good is head knowledge if there is nothing in the heart ? Christianity is not just a set of rules ; it 's a lifestyle that changes one's perspectives and personal conduct . And it demands obedience to God 's will . Some people can live by it , but many others can not or will not . That is their choice and I have to respect it because God respects it too . God be with you , Malcolm Lee : )

Also , how many atheists out there would actually take the stance and accor a higher value to their way of thinking over the theistic way of thinking . The typical selfish argument would be that both lines of thinking evolved from the same inherent motivation , so one is not , intrinsically , different from the other , qualitatively .

Organization : USCACSC , Los Angeles Lines : 187 Distribution : world Reply-To : robert @ cpuserver.acsc.com ( Robert Grant ) NNTP-Posting-Host : cpuserver.acsc.com Hi everyone , I thought that some people may be interested in my VR software on these groups : *******Announcing the release of Multiverse-1.0.2******* Multiverse is a multi-user , non-immersive , X-Windows based Virtual Reality system , primarily focused on entertainment/research . Features : Client-Server based model , using Berkeley Sockets . No limit to the number of users ( apart from performance ) . Generic clients . Customizable servers . Hierachical Objects ( allowing attachment of cameras and light sources ) . Multiple light sources ( ambient , point and spot ) . Objects can have extension code , to handle unique functionality , easily attached . Functionality : Client : The client is built around a 'fast ' render loop . Basically it changes things when told to by the server and then renders an image from the user's viewpoint . It also provides the server with information about the user's actions - which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to other users . The client is designed to be generic - in other words you do n't need to develop a new client when you want to enter a new world . This means that resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting it . The adaptations , as will be explained in a moment , occur in the servers . This release of the client software supports the following functionality : o Hierarchical Objects ( with associated addressing ) o Multiple Light Sources and Types ( Ambient , Point and Spot ) o User Interface Panels o Colour Polygonal Rendering with Phong Shading ( optional wireframe for faster frame rates ) o Mouse and Keyboard Input ( Some people may be disappointed that this software does n't support the PowerGlove as an input device - this is not because it ca n't , but because I do n't have one ! This will , however , be one of the first enhancements ! ) Server ( s ) : This is where customization can take place . The following basic support is provided in this release for potential world server developers : o Transparent Client Management o Client Message Handling This may not sound like much , but it takes away the headache of accepting and terminating clients and receiving messages from them - the application writer can work with the assumption that things are happening locally . Things get more interesting in the object extension functionality . This is what is provided to allow you to animate your objects : o Server Selectable Extension Installation : What this means is that you can decide which objects have extended functionality in your world . Basically you call the extension initialisers you want . o Event Handler Registration : When you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback functions for the events that you want the object to respond to . ( Current events supported : INIT , MOVE , CHANGE , COLLIDE & TERMINATE ) o Collision Detection Registration : If you want your object to respond to collision events just provide some basic information to the collision detection management software . Your callback will be activated when a collision occurs .

From : denning @ guvax.acc.georgetown.edu Subject : THE CLIPPER CHIP : A TECHNICAL SUMMARY Distribution : world Organization : Georgetown University Lines : 139 The following document summarizes the Clipper Chip , how it is used , how programming of the chip is coupled to key generation and the escrow process , and how law enforcement decrypts communications . Since there has been some speculation on this news group about my own involvement in this project , I 'd like to add that I was not in any way involved . I found out about it when the FBI briefed me on Thursday evening , April 15 . Since then I have spent considerable time talking with the NSA and FBI to learn more about this , and I attended the NIST briefing at the Department of Commerce on April 16 . The document below is the result of that effort . Dorothy Denning -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - THE CLIPPER CHIP : A TECHNICAL SUMMARY Dorothy Denning April 19 , 1993 INTRODUCTION On April 16 , the President announced a new initiative that will bring together the Federal Government and industry in a voluntary program to provide secure communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement . At the heart of the plan is a new tamper-proof encryption chip called the `` Clipper Chip '' together with a split-key approach to escrowing keys . Two escrow agencies are used , and the key parts from both are needed to reconstruct a key . CHIP STRUCTURE The Clipper Chip contains a classified 64-bit block encryption algorithm called `` Skipjack . '' The algorithm uses 80 bit keys ( compared with 56 for the DES ) and has 32 rounds of scrambling ( compared with 16 for the DES ) . It supports all 4 DES modes of operation . Throughput is 16 Mbits a second . Each chip includes the following components : the Skipjack encryption algorithm F , an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips N , a 30-bit serial number U , an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip ENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP To see how the chip is used , imagine that it is embedded in the AT & T telephone security device ( as it will be ) . Suppose I call someone and we both have such a device . After pushing a button to start a secure conversation , my security device will negotiate a session key K with the device at the other end ( in general , any method of key exchange can be used ) . The key K and message stream M ( i.e. , digitized voice ) are then fed into the Clipper Chip to produce two values : E [ M ; K ] , the encrypted message stream , and E [ E [ K ; U ] + N ; F ] , a law enforcement block . The law enforcement block thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U concatenated with the serial number N , all encrypted under the family key F. CHIP PROGRAMMING AND ESCROW All Clipper Chips are programmed inside a SCIF ( secure computer information facility ) , which is essentially a vault . The SCIF contains a laptop computer and equipment to program the chips . About 300 chips are programmed during a single session . The SCIF is located at Mikotronx . At the beginning of a session , a trusted agent from each of the two key escrow agencies enters the vault . Agent 1 enters an 80-bit value S1 into the laptop and agent 2 enters an 80-bit value S2 . These values serve as seeds to generate keys for a sequence of serial numbers . To generate the unit key for a serial number N , the 30-bit value N is first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1 . S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1 , producing a 64-bit block R1 : R1 = E [ D [ E [ N1 ; S1 ] ; S2 ] ; S1 ] . Similarly , N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and N3 , and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed : R2 = E [ D [ E [ N2 ; S1 ] ; S2 ] ; S1 ] R3 = E [ D [ E [ N3 ; S1 ] ; S2 ] ; S1 ] . R1 , R2 , and R3 are then concatenated together , giving 192 bits . The first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2 . The rest are discarded . The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2 . U1 and U2 are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow agencies . As a sequence of values for U1 , U2 , and U are generated , they are written onto three separate floppy disks . The first disk contains a file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part U1 . The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values . The third disk contains the unit keys U . Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent 2 takes the second disk . The third disk is used to program the chips . After the chips are programmed , all information is discarded from the vault and the agents leave . The laptop may be destroyed for additional assurance that no information is left behind . The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the room instead of two . The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2 , and the second two ( the escrow agents ) would take the disks back to the escrow agencies . The escrow agencies have as yet to be determined , but they will not be the NSA , CIA , FBI , or any other law enforcement agency . One or both may be independent from the government . LAW ENFORCEMENT USE When law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line , they will first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get access to the communications line . Let us assume that the tap is in place and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with Clipper . They will first decrypt the law enforcement block with the family key F. This gives them E [ K ; U ] + N. They will then take a warrant identifying the chip serial number N to each of the key escrow agents and get back U1 and U2 . U1 and U2 are XORed together to produce the unit key U , and E [ K ; U ] is decrypted to get the session key K. Finally the message stream is decrypted . All this will be accomplished through a special black box decoder operated by the FBI . ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND DISTRIBUTION NOTICE . All information is based on information provided by NSA , NIST , and the FBI . Permission to distribute this document is granted .

Mark 's comment still is valid . To suggest that AIDS is `` deserved '' IS ludicrous . I sin . I can resolve to abstain from sin , and do weekly ( more often , actually ) . Yet I routinely fail . I surely do deserve what I get , yet God compassionately provided the Incarnate Logos , Jesus , as a rememdy and a way out of our situation . If AIDS is deserved , I surely deserve instant death just as much , as do we all , as St. Paul so cogently remids us . To willingly judge `` others '' as deserving punishment seems to me to be the height of arrogance and lack of humility . > I wonder if AIDS would be a problem now if people did n't get > involved in deviant sexual behaviour . Certainly , people who > received tainted blood are not to blame . But it just goes > to show that all mankind is affected by the actions of a few . So what 's the point here ?

Opening a DOS window on the desktop can occasionally result in the windows `` blowing up '' into a set of horizontal lines , hashing the entire desktop . Nothing can recover this except to completely exit from Windows . The other irritating problem is that windows that scroll often overwrite lines rather than actually scrolling , as if a CR was printed without an LF . This seems ONLY to happen to communications programs , but I ca n't nail it down any further than that . Note , though , that the comms programs do n't have to be communicating . Even just scrolling back through capture buffers or displaying disk files in these programs causes the problem . Prior to the latest rev of Word Perfect for Windows , WPwin would sometimes blow up , and the error message would cite the video driver as the source of the problem .

If you would bother to check in any good dictioanry or thesaurus , I think you will find that `` arrogance '' has to do with an offensive exhibition of presumed or real superiority ( a paraphrase from my own Webster 's ) . Arrognace is about pride and haughtiness . A person can believe in absolute truth , even blindly ( whatever that means ) without being obnoxious about it . Just as a person can be a `` humble , '' authority-questioning , defying-any-theist-to-reply athiest and be quite arrogant . Arrogance is not about what you believe , it is about how you relate to what you believe and how you present it to others . If your overwhelming experience of Christians has been that they are arrogant , I apologozing both for myself and on the behalf of those who have offfended you . But my own experience , at least in forums like Usenet where you see a good mix of people , is that arrogant Christians and athiests seems to occur in about equal numbers . - Phil - Hey , we 're talking about the PHONE COMPANY , here .

Later , in the ninth inning with the bases loaded and two outs he puts lankford , a 300 hitter with power in as a pinch runner and uses Luis Alicea , a 250 hitter with no power as a pinch hitter . What the Hell is he thinking . Earlier in the game in an interview about acquiring Mark Whiten he commented how fortunate the Cardinals were to get Whiten and that Whiten would be a regular even though this meant that Gilkey would be hurt , But torre said he liked Gilkey coming off the bench . Gilkey hit over 300 last year , what does he have to do to start , The guy would be starting on most every team in the league .

Not necessarily -- - they could release the details of the algorithm without releasing the `` system key '' ( called SK by Hellman ) . That would make most people happy , and with some sort of verification procedure before key exchange , the `` official '' chips would only work with other '' official '' chips . In other words , secrecy of SK makes `` physically identical clone versions '' impossible ; secrecy of the algorithm shouldn't be necessary . Of course , revealing the algorithm opens them up to attacks on SK -- - since all units share this key , compromising it may be a big deal . Personally , I would n't feel too comfortable knowing that one `` secret '' 80-bit number held in many places was all that guaranteed my security . Of course , compromise of SK does n't necessarily mean that the system is compromised , but it 's impossible to tell whether or not that 's true with a secret algorithm . Incidentally , what 's to keep a `` secret algorithm '' from using the secret SK as the main key , with UK being only marginally important .

The initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links . For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting Americans . Rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth , privacy and law enforcement , previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement . Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer . It is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files . While encryption technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information , it also can be used by terrorists , drug dealers , and other criminals . A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the `` Clipper Chip '' has been developed by government engineers . The chip represents a new approach to encryption technology . It can be used in new , relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone . It scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today . This new technology will help companies protect proprietary information , protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically . At the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal , state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals . A `` key-escrow '' system will be established to ensure that the `` Clipper Chip '' is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding Americans . Each device containing the chip will have two unique 2 `` keys , '' numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device . When the device is manufactured , the two keys will be deposited separately in two `` key-escrow '' data bases that will be established by the Attorney General . Access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap . The `` Clipper Chip '' technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans . To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology , the Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices . In addition , respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings . The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption 's dual-edge sword : encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry , but it also can shield criminals and terrorists . We need the `` Clipper Chip '' and other approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities . In order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches ( like the key-escrow system ) , the President has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates : -- the privacy of our citizens , including the need to employ voice or data encryption for business purposes ; -- the ability of authorized officials to access telephone calls and data , under proper court or other legal order , when necessary to protect our citizens ; -- the effective and timely use of the most modern technology to build the National Information Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and the competitiveness of American industry in the global marketplace ; and -- the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export high technology products . The President has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries , the Congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed . 3 The Administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a National Information Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to information . This infrastructure of high-speed networks ( `` information superhighways '' ) will transmit video , images , HDTV programming , and huge data files as easily as today 's telephone system transmits voice . Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure , the Federal Government must act quickly to develop consistent , comprehensive policies regarding its use . The Administration is committed to policies that protect all Americans ' right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law . Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet . The provisions of the President 's directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also available . For additional details , call Mat Heyman , National Institute of Standards and Technology , ( 301 ) 975-2758 . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S TELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE Q : Does this approach expand the authority of government agencies to listen in on phone conversations ? A : No . `` Clipper Chip '' technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans . Q : Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation encrypted using the device . What would they have to do to decipher the message ? A : They would have to obtain legal authorization , normally a court order , to do the wiretap in the first place . They would then present documentation of this authorization to the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug smugglers . The key is split into two parts , which are stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key escrow system . Q : Who will run the key-escrow data banks ? A : The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent entities . At this point , the Department of Justice and the Administration have yet to determine which agencies will oversee the key-escrow data banks . Q : How strong is the security in the device ? How can I be sure how strong the security is ? A : This system is more secure than many other voice encryption systems readily available today . While the algorithm will remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow system , we are willing to invite an independent panel of cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all potential users that there are no unrecognized vulnerabilities . Q : Whose decision was it to propose this product ? A : The National Security Council , the Justice Department , the Commerce Department , and other key agencies were involved in this decision . This approach has been endorsed by the President , the Vice President , and appropriate Cabinet officials . Q : Who was consulted ? The Congress ? Industry ? A : We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on encryption issues , and expect those discussions to intensify as we carry out our review of encryption policy . We have briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the decisions related to this initiative . Q : Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers ? A : The government designed and developed the key access encryption microcircuits , but it is not providing the microcircuits to product manufacturers . Product manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip manufacturer that produces them . Q : Who provides the `` Clipper Chip '' ? A : Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance , California , and will sell the chip to encryption device manufacturers . The programming function could be licensed to other vendors in the future . Q : How do I buy one of these encryption devices ? A : We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating the `` Clipper Chip '' into their devices . Q : If the Administration were unable to find a technological solution like the one proposed , would the Administration be willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more powerful encryption devices ? A : This is a fundamental policy question which will be considered during the broad policy review . The key escrow mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product that is more secure , more convenient , and less expensive than others readily available today , but it is just one piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to encryption technology , which the Administration is developing . The Administration is not saying , `` since encryption threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement , we will prohibit it outright '' ( as some countries have effectively done ) ; nor is the U.S. saying that `` every American , as a matter of right , is entitled to an unbreakable commercial encryption product . '' There is a false `` tension '' created in the assessment that this issue is an `` either-or '' proposition . Rather , both concerns can be , and in fact are , harmoniously balanced through a reasoned , balanced approach such as is proposed with the `` Clipper Chip '' and similar encryption techniques . Q : What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton Administration 's policy toward encryption will differ from that of the Bush Administration ? A : It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption technology in telecommunications and computing and are committed to working with industry and public-interest groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans' privacy , help businesses to compete , and ensure that law enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime and terrorism . Q : Will the devices be exportable ? Will other devices that use the government hardware ? A : Voice encryption devices are subject to export control requirements . Case-by-case review for each export is required to ensure appropriate use of these devices . The same is true for other encryption devices . One of the attractions of this technology is the protection it can give to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad . With this in mind , we expect export licenses will be granted on a case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these devices to secure their own communications abroad . We plan to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability of these products .

'' Certainly he could have conquered Switzerland , but a million armed militiamen ( especially in a mountainous area , where tanks ' effectiveness is limited ) would have made it a real pain . The question a conqueror would ask , is `` is it worth the trouble ? '' The more difficult an invasion is , the more likely the answer would be `` no . '' Certainly a million riflemen ( as opposed to a professional army of only ten or twenty thousand , the best a country the size of Switzerland could support ) , makes invasions more difficult . > Hitler stayed out of Switzerland because the Swiss run the money in this > world . Really ? In 1939 ? I 'm not even sure you could prove that today ( despite the steriotype . ) Certainly the Swiss bankers were not essential to the German war-time economy . Frank Crary CU Boulder

They look like cylinders > that have been pinched in the middle . Does anybody know what the > actual purpose of those things are ? . I hear that they 're called > 'Cooling Towers ' but what the heck do they cool ? Except for their size , the cooling towers on nuclear power plants are vertually identical in construction and operation to cooling towers designed and built in the 1890 's ( a hundred years ago ) for coal fired power plants used for lighting and early electric railways . Basicly , the cylindrical tower supports a rapid air draft when its air is heated by hot water and/or steam circulating thru a network of pipes that fill about the lower 1/3 of the tower . To assist cooling and the draft , water misters are added that spray cold water over the hot pipes . The cold water evaporates , removing the heat faster than just air flow from the draft would and the resulting water vapor is rapidly carried away by the draft . This produces the clouds frequently seen rising out of these towers . That slight pinch ( maybe 2/3 of the way up the tower ) is there because it produces a very significant increase in the strength and rate of the air draft produced , compared to a straight cylinder shape . The towers are used to recondense the steam in the sealed steam system of the power plant so that it can be recirculated back to the boiler and used again . The wider the temperature difference across the turbines used in the power plant the more effecient they are and by recondensing the steam in the cooling towers before sending it back to the boilers you maintain a very wide temperature difference ( sometimes as high as 1000 degrees or more from first stage `` hot '' turbine to final stage `` cold '' turbine ) .

Any reason given for this ? Also , I just noticed something looking at the Nolan Ryan timeline in the preview . On 8/22/89 , Rickey Henderson became Nolan 's 5000th strikeout . On 6/11/90 he pitched his 6th no-hitter against Oakland . I believe the last out in the game was made by Rickey Henderson . And on 5/1/91 , Nolan pitched his 7th no-hitter on the same day a certain someone stole his 939th base , which overshadowed it . It seems that Nolan is having a lot of publicity at Rickey 's expense . IMO , Rickey deserves it , and it seems as most of the net agrees with me from what I 've seen on it lately . They are both great players , but IMO , Nolan has outclassed Rickey , both in playing and more importantly , in attitude . Just my thoughts . Kevin

The earlier cars ( pre 74-1/2 ) are usually more desirable due to certain things that went with having chrome bumpers ( ride height , generally more power ) . The older cars are appreciating ... slowly . The newer ones seem to be at a stable level at the moment . $ 6 to $ 8k would require extremely good condition and low miles . If the car is in good shape and regular maintenance is kept up on it , the car should last for a long time . There are still plenty of parts sources ouththere . The MGB is a great , fun little car . If she is keeping it solely in the hopes that it is going to appreciate , tell her to sell it . It is not worth waiting the time it would take to appreciate to a real profitable level . *************************************************************************** *Rick Guynn -MG driver soontobe . * MGA 1600 MkII * *RCG1597 @ zeus.tamu.edu * Rebuild ( complete ) to be finished ? ? * *Texas A & M University * * *Keeper of the eternal octagon * ` 69 MGB Roadster * * a.k.a .

The shipyards are still building Los Angeles Class submarines and there is a lack of ASW foes to contend with .

Look at the whole picture , not just randomly picked libertarian positions . If government is not allowed to use `` non-initiated force '' to achieve its goals , than no special interest can influence the government to use non-initiated force on their behalf . The means to reaching such a restricted government is another topic which I 'll address briefly . It certainly wo n't happen until libertarianism is the dominate philosophy . What means do we have to make libertarianism the dominate philosophy ? Statists run the education monopoly , so we have to be creative .

Free options The BEST option is XFree86 , which is an enhanced version of X386 1.2 . Any other version of X386 will have slower performance , and will be more difficult to compile . Information on how to obtain XFree86 is listed below . X386 is the port of the X11 server to System V/386 that was done by Thomas Roell ( roell @ sgcs.com ) . It supports a wide variety of SVGA boards . There are 2 major free versions : X386 1.1 is based on X11R4 , X386 1.2 is included in MIT 's X11R5 distribution ( ie . you do n't need to patch it into the MIT source any more ) . X386 1.3 is the current commercial offering from SGCS ( see below ) . 2 . Commercial options 1 ) Metro Link 2213 W.

II ) What is XFree86 and where do I get it ? 3 . What is XFree86 ? XFree86 is an enhanced version of X386 1.2 , which was distributed with X11R5 . This release consists of many bug fixes , speed improvements , and other enhancements . Here are the highlights of the enhancements : 1 ) The SpeedUp package from Glenn Lai is an integral part of XFree86 , selectable at run-time via the Xconfig file . Some SpeedUps require an ET4000 based SVGA , and others require a virtual screen width of 1024 . The SpeedUps suitable to the configuration are selected by default . With a high-quality ET4000 board ( VRAM ) , this can yield up to 40 % improvement of the xStones benchmark over X386 1.2 . 2 ) The fX386 packages from Jim Tsillas are included as the default operating mode if SpeedUp is not selected . This mode is now equivalent in performance to X386 1.1b ( X11R4 ) , and approximately 20 % faster than X386 1.2 . 3 ) Support for LOCALCONN , compile-time selectable for server , clients , or both . This support is for both SVR3.2 and SVR4 . For SVR4.0.4 with the 'Advanced Compatibility Package ' , local connections from SCO XSight/ODT clients are supported . 4 ) Drivers for ATI and Trident TVGA8900C and TVGA9000 SVGA chipsets . Refer to the files README.ati and README.trident for details about the ATI and Trident drivers . 5 ) Support for compressed bitmap fonts has been added ( Thomas Eberhardt's code from the contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu ) . 6 ) Type1 Font code from MIT contrib tape has been included , and is compile-time selectable . There are contributed Type1 fonts in the contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu . 7 ) New configuration method which allows the server 's drivers and font renderers to be reconfigured from both source and binary distributions . 8 ) Integrated support for 386BSD , Mach , and Linux . 9 ) A monochrome version of the server which will run on generic VGA cards is now included . The following key features were added with the release of XFree86 1.2 ( they were not in XFree86 1.1 ) : 1 ) The monochrome server has been enhanced to do bank-switching of available SVGA memory to allow virtual screens up to 1600x1200 ( see the X386 ( 1 ) manual page for more information ) . 2 ) Support for the Hercules mono card has been added to the monochrome server , and with it the ability to support a `` two headed '' server - one VGA , and one Hercules . So far this has only been tested on SVR4 ( it is also reported to work under Linux ) . 3 ) SVR3 shared libraries , tested under ISC SVR3 2.2 and 3.0.1 . 4 ) Support for SVR4.2 ( There are some special considerations to consider , due to new USL bugs ; see the README.SVR4 file for more information . ) 5 ) Support for PS/2 mice , and Logitech MouseMan/TrackMan ( some versions of these devices were not previously compatible ) . 6 ) A new tutorial on how to develop correct video card and monitor timing data , written by Eric Raymond ( derived from previous documentation and a lot of experimentation ) . 7 ) Greatly improved support for international keyboards , including implementation of the Compose key functionality found on many vendor servers ( see the X386keybd ( 1 ) manual page for more information ) . 8 ) The accuracy with which the server detects SVGA pixel clocks has been improved , and the timings are now stored at accuracies of 0.1 MHz . Users may want to consider removing an existing Clocks line from their Xconfig file and re-probing using the new server . 9 ) Many enhancements in error handling and parsing of the Xconfig configuration file . Error messages are much more informative and intuitive , and more validation is done . There are many new options that can be enabled in the Xconfig file ( see the X386 ( 1 ) manual page for more information on the format of this file ) . Plus a number of other small things . Refer to the CHANGELOG file in the source distribution for full details . Also included are a tutorial on monitor timing by Eric Raymond , and the current X386 mode database and a sample xdm configuration by David Wexelblat . 4 . What OSs are supported ? XFree86 supports : SVR4.2 : Consensys V4.2 SVR4.0 : Microport , Dell , Esix , ISC , AT & T , MST , Consensys , UHC SVR3 : ISC 2.2 & 3.0 , AT & T 2.2 Linux , Mach 386 , 386BSD 0.1 BSD/386 is not supported , but it should work . The most active BSD/386 person is Greg Lehey < grog @ lemis.de > . Note that Esix 3.2D and SCO are not supported yet , but anyone should feel free to submit patches . If you are interested in tackling this , send mail to xfree86 @ physics.su.oz.au 5 . What video hardware is supported ? At this time , XFree86 1.2 supports the following SVGA chipsets : Tseng ET4000 Tseng ET3000 Paradise PVGA1 Western Digital WD90C00 , WD90C10 , WD90C11 ( these are supersets of the PVGA1 , and use its driver ) Genoa GVGA Trident TVGA8900C , TVGA9000 ATI 18800 , 28800 All of the above are supported in both 256 color and monochrome modes , with the exception of the ATI chipsets , which are only supported in 256 color mode . The monochrome server also supports generic VGA cards , using 64k of video memory in a single bank , and the Hercules card . On the ET3000 , only 64k of video memory is supported for the monochrome server , and the GVGA has not been tested with more than 64k . It appears that some of the SVGA card manufacturers are going to non-traditional mechanisms for selecting pixel-clock frequencies . To avoid having to modify the server to accommodate these schemes XFree86 1.2 adds support for using an external program to select the pixel clock . This allows programs to be written as new mechanisms are discovered . Refer to the README.clkprog file for information on how these programs work , if you need to write one . If you do develop such a program , the XFree86 team would be interested in including it with future XFree86 releases . If you are purchasing new hardware for the purpose of using XFree86 , it is suggested that you purchase an ET4000-based board such as the Orchid ProDesigner IIs . Avoid recent Diamond boards ; XFree86 will not work with them , because Diamond wo n't provide programming details . In fact , the XFree86 project is actively not supporting new Diamond products , as long as such policies remain in effect . Contributions of code will NOT be accepted ( because of the potential liabilities ) . If you would like to see this change , tell Diamond about it . Some people have asked if XFree86 would work with local bus or EISA video cards . Theoretically , the means of communication between the CPU and the video card is irrelevant to Xfree86 compatibility . It could be ISA , EISA , or local bus . What should matter is the chipset on the video card . Unfortunately , the developers do n't have a lot of access to EISA or VLB machines , so this is largely an untested theory . However , we have yet to see any reports of things not working on one of these buses and we have several reports of Xfree86 working fine on them . 6 . What about accelerated boards ? At this time , there is no support in XFree86 for accelerated boards like the S3 , ATI Ultra ( 8514/A ) , TIGA , etc . This support is available in commercial products from SGCS and MetroLink ( for SVR3 and SVR4 ) . An S3 server is available for 386BSD and Linux . Contact < hasty @ netcom.com > for 386BSD or < jon @ robots.ox.ac.uk > for Linux . A beta 8514/A server is available for Linux . Contact < martin @ cs.unc.edu > or < jon @ robots.ox.ac.uk > . Note : these servers are NOT part of XFree86 . 7 . Why does n't XFree86 support 16-color VGA modes ? The reason that this is not supported is the way VGA implements the 16-color modes . In 256-color modes , each byte of frame buffer memory contains 1 pixel . But the 16-color modes are implemented as bit- planes . Each byte of frame- buffer memory contains 1 bit from each of each of 8 pixels , and there are four such planes . The MIT frame- buffer code is not designed to deal with this . If VGA handled 16-color modes by packing 2 4-bit pixels into each byte , the MIT code could be modified to support this ( or it already may ; I 'm not sure ) . But for the VGA way of doing things , a complete new frame-buffer implementation is required . Some beta testers are looking into this , but nothing is yet available from the project . 8 . What other hardware or software requirements are there ? Obviously , a supported SVGA board and OS are required . To run X efficiently , 12-16MB of memory should be considered a minimum . The various binary releases take 10-40MB of disk space , depending on the OS ( e.g . whether or not it supports shared libraries ) . To build from sources , at least 80MB of free disk space will be required , although 120MB should be considered a comfortable lower bound . 9 . Where can I get source for XFree86 ? Source patches for the current version ( 1.2 , based on X11R5 PL22 from MIT ) , are available via anonymous FTP from : export.lcs.mit.edu ( under /contrib/XFree86 ) ftp.physics.su.oz.au ( under /XFree86 ) ftp.win.tue.nl ( under /pub/XFree86 ) ( For the rest of this FAQ , these 3 location will be called $ FTP ) Refer to the README file under the specified directory for information on which files you need to get to build your distribution . 10 . Where can I get binaries for XFree86 ? Binaries are available via anonymous FTP from : ftp.physics.su.oz.au - SVR4 binaries under /XFree86/SVR4 ftp.win.tue.nl - SVR4 binaries under /pub/XFree86/SVR4 ferkel.ucsb.edu - SVR4 binaries under /pub/SVR4/XFree86 stasi.bradley.edu - SVR4 binaries under /pub/XFree86/SVR4 blancmange.ma.utexas.edu - SVR3 ( ISC ) binaries under /pub/ISC ftp.prz.tu-berlin.de - SVR3 ( ISC ) binaries under /pub/pc/isc/XFree86 tsx-11.mit.edu - Linux binaries under /pub/linux/packages/X11 agate.berkeley.edu - 386BSD binaries under /pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86 ftp.cs.uwm.edu - Mach binaries under /i386 Ensure that you are getting XFree86 1.2 - some of these sites may archive older releases as well . Each binary distribution will contain a README file that describes what files you need to take from the archive , and which compile-time option selections were made when building the distribution . IV ) What general things should I know about running XFree86 ? 11 . Installation directories The top-level installation directory is specified by the ProjectRoot ( /usr/X386 , by default ) variable in config/site.def . Binaries , include files , and libraries are installed in $ ProjectRoot/ { bin , include , lib } . This can be changed when rebuilding from sources , and can be modified via symbolic links for those OSs that support them . This directory is nonstandard , and was chosen this way to allow XFree86 to be installed alongside a commercial/vendor-supplied X implementation . 12 . Configuration files The XFree86 server reads a configuration file ( `` Xconfig '' ) on startup . The search path , contents and syntax for this file are documented in the server manpage , which should be consulted before asking questions . 13 . Determining VGA dot clocks and monitor modes David E Wexelblat ( dwex @ mtgzfs3.att.com ) maintains a database of known clock settings for VGA cards and monitor settings . The database is installed in /usr/X386/lib/X11/etc/modeDB.txt , and is in the source tree under mit/server/ddx/x386/etc . This database is also available from him ( for the latest copy ) , and is kept on export.lcs.mit.edu in ~/contrib/X386.modeDB.Z , which is updated occasionally . Obtain a copy of this database . It just might have the settings you need . If you create new settings , please send them to David for inclusion in the database . If this does n't help you , the VideoModes.doc ( by Eric Raymond ) file with XFree86 contains tutorials on how to come up with these timings . It may be helpful to start with settings that almost work , and use this description to get them right . When you do , send the information to David Wexelblat for inclusion in the database . NOTE : The old 'clock.exe ' program is not supported any more , and is completely unnecessary . If you need to determine dot clock values for a new board , remove the 'Clocks ' line from your Xconfig file ( if present ) , and start the server . The server will probe for clocks itself and print them out . You can use these values to put a 'Clocks ' line into your Xconfig file , which is not necessary , but will speed up starting the server in the future . 14 . Rebuilding/reconfiguring the server from the link kit If you have installed the server Binary Link Kit , it is possible to reconfigure the drivers and font renderers in the server . This is fully explained in the README file that is available with the link kit . V ) What OS-specific things should I know about running XFree86 ? First of all , the server must be installed suid-root ( mode 4755 ) . 15 . SVR4 Why wo n't my xterm run properly ? If your kernel is not built with the consem module , you should define CONSEM=no in you environment . Otherwise xterm wo n't run . csh users should use 'setenv CONSEM no' The Esix console driver patch 403019 is known to cause keymapping problems with XFree86 . It recommended that this patch not be installed . Alternatively they keymap can be fixed with xmodmap . 16 . SVR3 Make sure you look at $ FTP/README.ISC , if that 's what you are running . 17 . 386BSD Make sure you look at $ FTP/README.386BSD . Also , a separate 386BSD FAQ is maintained by Richard Murphey < Rich @ Rice.edu > . The latest version should be available in the file XFree86-1.2-386BSD-FAQ at the following ftp sites : agate.berkeley.edu : /pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2 wuarchive.wustl.edu : /mirrors4/386bsd/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2 grasp1.univ-lyon1.fr : pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2 18 . Linux You must be running Linux 0.97pl4 or greater , and have the 4.1 gcc jump libraries installed . Make sure the binaries X386 , X386mono , xload and xterm are setuid root . If your kernel does n't have TCP support compiled in , you 'll have to run the server as `` X -pn '' . The default startup configuration assumes that TCP is not available . If it is , change the two files /usr/X386/bin/startx and /usr/X386/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers , removing the -pn argument to X386 . Make sure /dev/console is either a link to /dev/tty0 or has the major number 4 , minor number 0 . Also note that if /dev/console is not owned by the user running X , then xconsole and xterm will not permit console output redirection . Xdm will properly change the owner , but startx wo n't . When running xdm from rc.local , you will need to provide it with a tty , for example `` xdm < /dev/console & '' . For more detailed information , please read the file README present with the distribution on tsx-11.mit.edu . 19 . Mach Make sure you look at $ FTP/README.Mach . VI ) What things should I know for building XFree86 from source ? This section has been removed from the FAQ , since it is fully explained in $ FTP/README and the OS-specific READMEs . Please look at those files for information on building XFree86 . VII ) Is there anything special about building clients with XFree86 ? 20 . BSD compatibility library A lot of clients make use of BSD functions like bcopy ( ) , etc . The default configuration files are set up to link with libXbsd.a which contains emulation for bcopy ( ) , bzero ( ) , bcmp ( ) , ffs ( ) , random ( ) , seed ( ) . A better way of providing the ' b ' functions is to include < X11/Xfuncs.h > in source files that call them . Xfuncs.h provides macro definitions for these in terms of the SYSV 'mem ' functions . If you are linking with a vendor supplied library which calls some of these functions , then you should link with libXbsd.a 21 . ANSICCOPTIONS This is something that was added to allow a developer to get rid of the ANSI-ness defined in the default CCOPTIONS without having to rewrite the entire CCOPTIONS line . For example , with stock MIT , you 'd see something like CCOPTIONS= '' -ansi -O2 -fwritable-strings '' and to get rid of the ANSI-ness , the developer would have to put CCOPTIONS= '' -O2 -fwritable-strings '' in his Imakefile . With this change , you would see a default of ANSICCOPTIONS= '' -ansi '' CCOPTIONS= '' -O2 -fwritable-strings '' and all the developer would have to put in the Imakefile is : ANSICCOPTIONS= to get rid of the ANSI-ness ( many X clients will die a horrible death with -ansi ) . The effect is even more dramatic in practice , because CCOPTIONS is actually quite complex . The other issue is that one must add 'ANSICCOPTIONS= $ ( ANSICCOPTIONS ) ' to a PassCDebugFlags definition .

Attempting to ream my faith without replacing it with something `` better '' is a real good way to loose a person completely from Christ . This is the greatest reason I see that these attacks are not motivated by love . They only seek to destroy there is no building or replacing of belief . This is not something Christ did . He guided and instructed He did n't seek to destroy the faith He found , He redirected it . This is what I see when people say they `` love '' < insert favorite group here > . And I have to laugh at the irony . Please excuse the scarcasm but it was nice to say it . Oh , BTW Robert do n't take this personally , your post was merely convinent .

From : grady @ netcom.com ( 1016/2EF221 ) Subject : Declassifying media Organization : capriccioso X-Newsreader : TIN [ version 1.1 PL6 ] Lines : 82 There are many Urban Legends ( maybe this ought to be in the Crypt FAQ ? ) about what is actually sufficient to clear or declassify magnetic media when used for classified data . Here is some information `` from the horse 's mouth '' . ( Regarding the sufficient overwriting of media ( `` clearing '' ) meant to be *retained* within the controlled environment , or declassifying the material to be reused *outside* the controlled environment , ) From National Telecommunications and Information Systems Security ( NTISS ) `` Advisory Memorandum on Office Automation Security Guidelines '' ( NTISSAM COMPUSEC/1/87 ) : -- -- -- '' 7.6.2.1 Clearing of Magnetic Media Certain types of removable media ( e.g. , magnetic tape , floppy disk , cassettes , and magnetic cards ) may be cleared by overwriting the entire media one time with any one character . Floppy disks may be cleared by applying a vendor 's formatting program that overwrites each location with a given character . Fixed media ( e.g. , Winchester disks ) should be cleared by overwriting at least one time with any one character . One way to do this is by applying a vendor-supplied formatting program that overwrites each location on the disk with a given character , if it can be shown that this program actually works as advertised . The user should beware : some programs that purport to overwrite all locations do not actually do this . Cleared media may be resides within the controlled facility or released for destruction ; however , they should be marked and controlled at the level of the most restrictive sensitivity of information ever recorded . 7.6.2.2 Declassification of Magnetic Media Certain types of removable media can be declassified using a degaussing device that has been approved for declassifying media of that type . ( A list of approved devices is maintained by the NSA . ) If a fixed medium ( for example , a hard , or Winchester , disk ) is operative , an approved method of declassifying the disk pack is to employ an overwrite procedure which must overwrite all addressable locations at least three times by writing any character , then its complement ( e.g. , binary ones and binary zeros ) alternatively . When fixed media become inoperative , it is impossible to declassify the media by the overwrite method . In this case , there are two alternate procedures that may be used : ( 1 ) disassemble the disk pack , and degauss each platter with the appropriate approved degaussing equipment ; and ( 2 ) courier the inoperative media to the vendor 's facility , have the magnetic media ( e.g. , disk platter ) removed in sight of the courier and returned to the courier for destruction at the secure site . The vendor can then install new platters and repair any other problems with the disk unit . 7.6.3 Destruction of Magnetic Media '' [ see DoD Computer Security Center , `` Department of Defense Magnetic Remanence Security Guideline '' , CSC-STD-003-85 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY ] -- -- -- This and many other interesting documents ( many that are more informative than probably intended ) on computer security procedures can be obtained ( free ) from : Executive Secretary National Telecommunications and Informations Systems Security Committee National Security Agency Fort George G.

It is called 'The Justice ' . We also demand that the x-Soviet Armenian Government admit its responsibility for the Turkish and Kurdish Genocide , render reparations to the Muslim people , and return the land to its rightful owners . The recognition of the Genocide has become an issue which can not be delayed further , and it is imperative that artificial obstacles created for political manipulations be removed . > Now if we 're talking about rent and vandalism , let 's make it fair then : > Greece pays back it 's dues and Turkey pays for 400 years rent and > destruction of classical architecture . Deal ? Democracy in action . Are you the 'truelove ' or 'falselove ' of 'Arromdian ' of the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle ? `` If Turks had behaved like Christians to use force to convert to Islam the nations which they brought under their power , to which no one could have opposed , today there would be no Eastern problem . But Turks did not do so . They obeyed the word of the Koran to permit everybody `` to worship in their own way '' centuries before Frederick the Great pronounced his famous dictum . Thus , in an age when the Christian Europe itself shed Christian blood and when people in Europe enjoyed inflicting inhuman tortures upon those whose beliefs differed from theirs , the Ottoman Empire became the sole country where the inquisition did not exist , where deaths at the stake were unheard of and where accusations of witchcraft were not made . And the barbarian ( ! ) Turkey was the only country where the Jews persecuted and chased away everywhere by the Christians , could find asylum . These facts demonstrate that Muslim countries provided spiritually far better living conditions than Christian countries . `` [ 1 ] '' The Turks , who are a conquering nation , did not Turkify the nations that came under their rule ; instead , they respected their religions and traditions . It was a stroke of luck for Romania to live under Turkish rule instead of Russian or Austrian rule . Because otherwise there would not have been a Romanian nation today '' ( Popescu Ciocanel ) . `` Turks rule over people under their administration only externally , without interfering with their internal structures . On account of this , the autonomy of minorities in Turkey is better and more complete than any in the most advanced European countries . `` [ 2 ] '' ... human beings hate each other on account of religious differences . This flaw is older than Islam and Christianity . But there has never been any examples of this adjuration in Turkey because Turks never oppress anybody on account of his religion . If enmity on the basis of religion had been such a case of simple contempt among us too , or if it did not keep translating itself into action , many nations in our Europe would probably have considered themselves happy ! '' ( A. de Mortraye ) . [ 3 ] '' Turkey never became a scene for religious terror or for the cruelty of the inquisition . On the contrary , it served as an asylum for the unfortunate victims of Christian fanaticism . If you look into history , you will see that in the fifteenth century thousands of Jews who were expelled from Spain and Portugal found such a good asylum in Turkey that their descendants have been living there very calmly all through these approximately three hundred years , and are only forced to defend themselves in some countries against the cruelty of Christians , especially that of the Orthodoxes . No Jew is able to appear in public during Easter celebrations in Athens , even today . In Turkey , however , if the Israelites are insulted by the Greek and Armenian communities , local courts immediately take them under their protection . '' `` In that vast and calm country of the sultan , all religions and nations are living together peacefully . Although the mosque is superior to the church and the synagogue , it does not replace them . Because of this , the Catholic sect is more free in Istanbul and Smyrna compared with Paris and Lyon . In addition to the fact that no law in Turkey prohibits the open-air ceremonies of this sect , neither does any law imprison its cross in the church . While the dead are being taken to the graves , a long line of priests bear processional candles and chant Catholic hymns . When all the priests in all the churches in the Galata and Beyoglu districts go into the streets and form clerical processions during the Eucharist celebrations , chanting hymns and bearing their crosses and religious banners , a detachment of soldiers escorts them which forces even the Turks to stand in respect around the group of priests .

From : jk87377 @ lehtori.cc.tut.fi ( Kouhia Juhana ) Subject : XV problems Organization : Tampere University of Technology Lines : 113 Distribution : world NNTP-Posting-Host : cc.tut.fi [ Please , note the Newsgroups . ] Recent discussion about XV 's problems were held in some newsgroup . Here is some text users of XV might find interesting . I have added more to text to this collection article , so read on , even you so my articles a while ago . I hope author of XV corrects those problems as best he can , so fine program XV is that it is worth of improving . ( I have also minor ideas for 24bit XV , e-mail me for them . ) Any misundertanding of mine is understandable . Juhana Kouhia ==clip== [ ..deleted.. ] Note that 'xv ' saves only 8bit/rasterized images ; that means that the saved jpegs are just like jpeg-to-gif-to-jpeg quality . Also , there 's three kind of 8bit quantizers ; your final image quality depends on them too . This were the situation when I read jpeg FAQ a while ago . IMHO , it is design error of 'xv ' ; there should not be such confusing errors in programs . There 's two errors : -xv allows the saving of 8bit/rasterized image as jpeg even the original is 24bit -- saving 8bit/rasterized image instead of original 24bit should be a special case -xv allows saving the 8bit/rasterized image made with any quantizer -- the main case should be that 'xv ' quantizes the image with the best quantizer available before saving the image to a file ; lousier quantizers should be just for viewing purposes ( and a special cases in saving the image , if at all ) ==clip== ==clip== [ ..deleted.. ] It is limit of *XV* , but not limit of design . It is error in design . It is error that 8bit/quantized/rasterized images are stored as jpegs ; jpeg is not designed to that . As matter of fact , I 'm sure when XV were designed 24bit displays were known . It is not bad error to program a program for 8bit images only at that time , but when 24bit image formats are included to program the whole design should be changed to support 24bit images . That were not done and now we have -the program violate jpeg design ( and any 24bit image format ) -the program has human interface errors . Otherway is to drop saving images as jpegs or any 24bit format without clearly saying that it is special case and not expected in normal use . [ ..deleted.. ] ==clip== Some new items follows . ==clip== I have seen that XV quantizes the image sometimes poorly with -best24 option than with default option we have . The reason surely is the quantizer used as -best24 ; it is ( surprise ) the same than used in ppmquant . If you remember , I have tested some quantizers . In that test I found that rlequant ( with default ) is best , then comes djpeg , fbmquant , xv ( our default ) in that order . In my test ppmquant suggeeded very poorly -- it actually gave image with bad artifacts . I do n't know is ppmquant improved any , but I expect no . So , use of XV 's -best24 option is not very good idea . I suggest that author of XV changes the quantizer to the one used in rlequant -- I 'm sure rle-people gives permission . ( Another could be one used in ImageMagick ; I have not tested it , so I can say nothing about it . ) ==clip== ==clip== Some minor bugs in human interface are : Key pressings and cursor clicks goes to a buffer ; Often it happens that I make click errors or press keyboard when cursor is in the wrong place . It is very annoying when you have waited image to come about five minutes and then it is gone away immediately . The buffer should be cleaned when the image is complete . Also , good idea is to wait few seconds before activating keyboard and mouse for XV after the image is completed . Often it happens that image pops to the screen quickly , just when I 'm writing something with editor or such . Those key pressings then go to XV and image has gone or something weird . In the color editor , when I turn a color meter and release it , XV updates the images . It is impossible to change all RGB values first and then get the updated image . It is annoying wait image to be updated when the setting are not ready yet . I suggest of adding an 'apply ' button to update the exchanges done . ==clip==

And this is truely sad . I would hate to see a day when churches put people to death or torchured them for practicing homosexuality , or any other crime . The church is not called to take over the governments of the world . It may be that homosexuals treated cruelly today , but that does not mean that we should teach Christians to practice homosexual immorality . Do you think that we should also teach Christians to practice divination and channelling because the witches in the middle ages were persecuted . > The major flaw in all this posturing is that in the end , the > final effect of posts like that of yours and Mr. Hudson is that YOU have a > '' conditional '' love for gays .

'' And you accuse me of judging ? When did you look into my heart and see if I have love . I have been writing that we should not teach Christians to practice homosexual immorality , and you pretend to have divine knowledge to look into my heart . I ca n't say that I love homosexuals as I should- I ca n't say that I love my neighbor as I should either . I do n't know very many homosexuals as it is . But Jesus loves homosexuals , just as He loves everyone else . If His love were conditional , I not know Him at all . Yes . We should show love to homosexuals , but it is not love to encourage brothers in the church to stumble and continue in their sin . That is a very damaging and dangerous thing . > The results of the passing amendment in > Colorado has created an organization who 's posters are appearing all over > Colorado called `` S.T.R.A.I.G.H.T .

That is slander . I could just as easily say that NAMBLA has been able to implement legislation to make child molesting easier because of the tearing down of societies morality due to people accepting homosexuality as normal , and that this is what you are embracing . I do believe that homosexual sex is immoral , that does not mean I endorse using violence against them . There is a problem of hatred in the church . But there is also the problem of what has been called `` unsanctified mercy . '' Many in the conservative churches have seen the moral breakdown in this country and the storm on the horizon , and have gotten militant in the flesh . This is truely sad . Yet others in other churches have embraced immorality in society , and have pointed to the carnality in the conservative churches to justify their actions . > Why do n't we just stick to the positive and find ways to bring people > to Jesus istead of taking bullwhips and driving them away ? Certainly we should not use a bullwhip to drive people from Jesus . But we should n't water down the gospel to draw people in . Jesus didn't go out of His way to show only what might be considered positive aspects to draw people in . He told one man to sell all He had . He told another not to say good bye to His family . His words were hard at times . We should present people with the cost of the tower before we allow them to begin construction . many people have already been innoculated to the gospel .

Now I would like to display the name of the file corresponding to the value of the dragged scale button ( i.e . with the MB1 pressed ) . As XmNshowValue only displays the current value of the scale button and not the actual corresponding image file name , I thought of using an XtAddEventHandler to do the mapping between the scale value and the file name : XtAddEventHandler ( scaleImage , Button1MotionMask , FALSE , SliderMoved , NULL ) ; and in the eventhandler do a : while ( XCheckTypedWindowEvent ( display , event- > window , MotionNotify , & Return ) ) ; XmScaleGetValue ( scaleImage , & value ) ; /*map value to file entry in directory and finally obtain file name to open*/ However , when I move the pointer in the scale widget I get callbacks , with of co urse a null effect as my MB1 is not pressed to move the scale button . So what is goin g wrong ? Or is the a wrong approach to this problem ? Any hints are highly appreciated . -- - Phil

Soderstrom is probably the biggest surprise . Re Eric : True , but fortunately we did n't get to find out what they would be like without Recchi for 30 games . Soderstrom : Absolutely . 4 shutouts in 39 games for a rookie without a lot of defense in front of him . Runnerups to Galley and Fedyk who are scoring a ton over their career best . But Galley thinks he 's Paul Coffey ( puts scoring ahead of defending ) and Fedyk has tailed off big time . Eklund : Was a big question mark this year and was coming off injuries . 42 points in 49 games is not bad at all , and recently he 's been a huge factor in the wins they 've gotten . Eklund has never had a point a game season in his career , his production is very typical for him . How does he qualify as a disappointment ? If anything he 's a surprise . My choice would be Roussel if I went strictly by what was expected of players , but I never thought that he had what it takes to be a # 1 goalie . My biggest disappointment is Bill Dineen . I thought that he was going to be the perfect coach for this young team , instead he 's made too many bad moves and IMHO has cost them enough games to keep them out of the playoffs this year .

Anyway , I think it would be a great idea to develop such a product , perhaps in the underground , as it would otherwise probably become illegal pretty quickly here ... It 's really very feasible and should n't be too expensive - all that 's needed is a box with a phone jack on one side , a DSP in the middle to do codec functions of speech- > compressed bytestream , and an RS232 on the other side . You 'd plug your phone into it , plug the RS232 into your computer , and have a good old fashioned normal modem on your other RS232 port . The CPU in the middle would do the encryption with a version of pgp modified to work on a byte stream . With v32bis or better modems to carry the bytestream , it should work . Quality would only be marginally lower than a normal telephone . At the very highest price , you could use one of those voice-mail compatible modems to do the digitisation - that puts an upper bound of about $ 500 on the cost of such a box . In practice , you really ought to be able to get the price well below $ 100 - I could do it now in software on my cheap & nasty home RISC box ( Acorn Archimedes ) with the digitising microphone I bought for 25 pounds , if I knew how to write good speech compression software ( which I do n't ) . The reason it wo n't work of course is that hardly anyone will have one - the only consumer equipment to have encryption will use the wiretap chip . Economics , I 'm afraid . However ... we can get about 2Kcps throughput on the internet even with the bottleneck of a v32bis modem . When we get ISDN for all ( ha ha ha ) and the new NREN , it might then be trivial to run compressed speech over a tcp/ip connection on the Internet . Perhaps we should start thinking now of a standard to keep voice on the internet compatible for everyone , and side-step the clipper stuff and use internet for all our phone calls in future : - ) [ 1/2 joking ] G

This probably tells you something about how much to trust the trade rags -- if they ca n't even get the NAME of the window system right , why should one trust anything else they have to say ? With regard to dialup X11 implementations , there are several . You can buy serial X11 terminals from a couple of companies , including both GraphOn and NCD . ( In fact , I 'm composing this from an NCD running X11 over serial lines across 14.4 kbaud connection . ) NCD also sells a software-only package that provides XRemote ( which is NCD 's implementation of serial X11 ) for PC 's . There may be other such software packages available . X11R6 is supposed to include a standardized compression scheme for running X11 over low-speed connections . It 's called Low Bandwidth X ( LBX ) , and is based on improved versions of the techniques used in NCD 's XRemote .

I pointed out that I did , in fact , agree that both Robert Weiss and Jim Meritt took quotes out of context . Hence , I find it difficult to understand why Jim thinks I am a hypocrite . Needless to say , I don't have time to reply to *every* article on t.r.m . that takes a quote out of context . I asked Jim the following : > } So , according to you , Jim , the only way to criticize one person for > } taking a quote out of context , without being a hypocrite , is to post a > } response to *every* person on t.r.m who takes a quote out of context ? Jim replied by saying > Did I either ask or assert that ? But today we find four articles from Jim , one of which has the subject '' Silence is concurrence '' : m23364 @ mwunix.mitre.org ( James Meritt ) writes : > Is it not the case that , in the eyes of the law , when someone is aware of > something and has the capability of taking action and does not , that individual > may be held responsible for that action ? Which is , of course , a complete red herring . Taking quotes out of context is n't a crime . I do n't have time to read every article on t.r.m. , and I 'm certainly under no obligation to reply to them all . Does `` silence is concurrence '' imply that Jim thinks that because I did n't respond to Weiss ' articles I must condone Weiss ' taking quotes out of context ? Jim does n't want to give a direct answer to this question ; read what he has written and decide for yourself . But back to the context of my conversation with Jim . Jim 's next gambit was to claim that he was using inductive logic when he concluded that I was being a hypocrite . I challenged him to provide the details of that logic that led him to an incorrect conclusion . Today we find another obscure article ( posting it twice did n't help make it more clear , Jim ) , titled `` Inductive Logic '' : > Scenario : > A white goose waddles past the door > A white goose waddles past the door > A white goose waddles past the door > ... ( repeat an uncountably large number of times ) ... > A black goose waddles past the door . An individual hits it with an axe . > > 1 . Given that the population of geese is uncountably large , and the size of the > confidence interval for the decision is undetermined , under what conditions > could a decision upon the behavior of the individual towards white geese > be made ? > > 2 . If ONLY black geese are observed to be axed , is it not a valid question > to be concerned with the different behavior between black and white geese ? More red herrings . Could Jim mean that he has read an uncountably large number of my articles ? Could Jim mean that because I `` axed '' his articles , but not Weiss ' articles , he wants to conclude inductively ... Well , I ca n't see where he is going with this . But I can help him with his induction . I 've written roughly 80 articles since January . The vast majority of them are discussions with Frank DeCenso and other inerrantists , where I take the position that they are making bad arguments . Some are discussions with Jim Meritt where I take the position that he is making bad arguments ( a straw man argument earlier , and taking quotes out of context more recently . ) Think hard about this Jim . See the pattern ? Think harder . Run it through your induction engine and see what pops out . dj

I have tried to find info on this but I could not get precise answers . On one hand , we have a Quadra 950 with a 16 '' monitor , which is capable of 32-bit color . How much VRAM does it have ? On the other hand , we have a Quadra 800 with a 16 '' monitor , which is capable of 8-bit color only , so it must have 512 Ko of VRAM . I would like to take VRAM SIMMs for the 950 and put them in the 800 so that both machines have 16-bit color capability . Is it possible , and if yes , how many VRAM SIMMs should I take from the 950 ? From the documentation I have , the Quadra 800 must get 1 Mo VRAM to have 16-bit color , is that correct ? Bonus question : where do VRAM SIMMs hide ? From the 950 documentation , they seem to be *behind* the power supply . Do I really have to take off the power supply to access the VRAM SIMMs ? Thanks for your help ! -- Daniel Salber , User Interface Research Team , LGI-IMAG , Grenoble , France . salber @ imag.fr

However , the `` gifted one '' can > only hear himself speaking in his own language . > There seem to be many points to the speaking in tongues thing which are problematic . It 's use as prayer language seems especially troubling to me . I understand that when you pray in tongues , the spirit is doing the talking . And when you pray , you pray to God . And the Spirit is God . So , the Spirit is talking to Himself . Which is why I only go by the Pentecost use where it 's an actual language . Moreover , the phrase `` though I speak with the tongues of men and angels '' used by Paul in I Cor . is misleading out of context . Some would then assume that there is some angelic tongue , and if when they speak , it is no KNOWN language , then it is an angelic tongue . Hmmm ... in the old testament story about the tower of Babel , we see how God PUNISHED by giving us different language . Can we assume then that if angels have their own language at all , that they have the SAME one amongst other angels ? After all , THEY were not punished in any manner . So why do these supposed angelic tongues all sound different FROM ONE ANOTHER ? It 's disturbing to think that some people find ways to justify jabbering . But I 'll buy the idea that someone could talk in a language never learned . Trouble is , while such stories abound , any and all attempts at verification ( and we are to test the spirit ... ) either show that the witness had no real idea of the circumstances , or that outright fabrication was involved . The Brother Puka story in a previous post seems like a `` friend of a friend '' thing . And linguistically , a two syllable word hardly qualifies as language , inflection or no . Much as many faith healers have trouble proving their `` victories '' ( since most ailments `` cured '' are just plain unprovable ) and modern day ressurrections have never been validated , so is it true that no modern day xenoglossolalia has been proved by clergy OR lay .

'' > Now my comments : I 'd like to add that some of the `` protests '' do not come from a strictly practical consideration of what pollution levels are acceptable for research activities by professional astronomers . Some of what I would complain about is rooted in aesthetics . Many readers may never have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred - unsullied by the actions of humans . The space between the stars as profoundly black as an abyss can be . With full horizons and a pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time - none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man . Any lights were supplied solely by nature ; uncorruptable by men . Whole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there and becoming immortal as the stars , whether by apotheosis or a belief in an afterlife . The Space Age changed all that . The effect of the first Sputniks and Echo , etc . on this view could only happen once . To see a light crossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people is still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating the scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or thousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe . But there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky . Yes , I know aircraft are almost always in sight . I have to live in a very populated area ( 6 miles from an international airport currently ) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly . The impact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists that has not been shaped , sculpted , modified , trashed or whipped into shape by the hands of man . In some places the only life forms larger than bacteria are humans , cockroaches , and squirrels ( or rats ) . I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains one weekend , `` getting away from it all '' ( paved roads , indoor plumbing , malls , ... ) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed the hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80 miles to the east . ( Their 'security light ' did n't help matters much either . ) But I 've heard the artic wilderness gets lots of high air traffic . So I know the skies are rarely perfect . But there is still this desire to see a place that man has n't fouled in some way . ( I mean they 've been TRYING this forever - like , concerning Tesla 's idea to banish night , - wow ! ) I do n't watch commercial television , but I can imagine just how disgusting beer , truck , or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high . If ya ' got ta make a buck on it ( displaying products in heaven ) , at least consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last beautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life . To be open about this though , I have here my listing of the passage of HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at 8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the local meridian from Baltimore vicinity . I 'll be trying to see it if I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all . So I suppose I could be called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky while complaining about billboards proposed by others . Be that as it may , I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid , even if it ca n't ever be perfectly achieved . Regards , Wm . Hathaway Baltimore MD

Any opinions on the anti-depressant drugs ? Millions have it , according to my physician . You just learn to cope with it ( like I mentioned earlier ) by ignoring it . It eventually becomes unconscious . The doc also said it could be caused by diet ( ie : too much caffeine ) and stress , but I have n't changed my lifestyle much , and it just comes and goes ( it is always there somewhat , but now I rarely notice it when it really `` kicks in '' ) . Also , it does n't necessarily mean there is any hearing loss , either caused by it or causing it . I had an ENT ( ear/nose/throat ) exam , and passed . In fact , my hearing is quite good considering I do n't take as good of care of my hearing as I should . Her reaction is normal . If it is tinnitus , chances are good she'll begin to not even notice it .

I had drove it for couples times and I think its a great car , esp on snow . However when she took it to a local Subaru dealer for a oil change , the bill came out to be about 80 dollars . The dealer told us it is because to change the oil filter on a SVX it is necessary to disassemble a metal cover under the engine and that took an hour of labour . At first , we think we are being ripped off so she phone to a dealer in Toronto but found out the they are charging roughly the same price . So is there any SVX owner out there that has the same problem ? And if the oil change story is true , then the engineer of Subaru looks pretty stubid to me . By the way , the car looks great .

By the fourth inning , Astacio had already made about 80 pitches , but the score was still 2-2 . The Dodger defense made SEVERAL impressive plays . Piazza looked GREAT behind the plate , gunning down a runner trying to steal second , throwing a runner out at first who had strayed a bit from first base , etc . Karros also made a spectacular play , keeping a ball from going into the outfield . The runner on first was so sure that ball was going through , he just kept running past second . Karros got up and threw to third and EASILY got the runner at third . My heart sank in the 7th when Gross got up to warm up in the bullpen . Astacio was lifted for a pinch hitter , and when Gross entered the game with the score still 2-2 , Dodger fans just KNEW it was over . Gross was relieving because he stunk on Tuesday , pitching just 2 1/3 innings , forcing Lasorda to use much of his bullpen . The 15 inning game had the same effect the next night ... so only Gross was fresh given his light work out Tuesday . Gross lived up to his name . He walked the first batter , gave up a hit to the second , and walked the bases loaded . After a grounder resulted in a force at home , Zeile lifted a scoring fly ball to make it 3-2 Cards . Gross paid little attention to the runners , and the next thing you knew , the Cards had stolen a fourth run . The runner on first was eventually tagged out in the run down , but the 4th run had scored long before that . Meanwhile , the Dodgers mounted little offense after the second inning . Lee Smith pitched the ninth . He had little trouble getting Karros and Wallach ( does anyone have trouble with Wallach these days ? ) . Cory Snyder collected his first hit as a Dodger , a single , but that was all the offense the Dodgers could mount . Smith got his third straight save against the Dodgers and all I got was my free Dodger cap and a good look at Piazza . If Piazza keeps this up all year , he will be a strong candidate for rookie of the year honors . Though its really early , Karros is already showing signs of a sophomore jinx year . The final score ... Cardinals 4 runs on 7 hits . Dodgers 2 runs on 7 hits . Dodger
From : jmgree01 @ starbase.spd.louisville.edu ( Jude M. Greer ) Subject : Gateway 2000 and ATI LB problem . Nntp-Posting-Host : starbase.spd.louisville.edu Organization : University of Louisville Lines : 25 I was wondering if anyone out there has had the same problem I am having with my Gateway 2000 486-33DX VL-Bus system with ATI Graphics Ultra Pro LB . When I have my computer in any resolution other than 800x600 , everything is fine , but whenever I use it in 800x600 ( Windows , AutoCAD , GIFs ) the screen gets about 1 1/2 inches shorter . At the very top and very bottom of the screen there is about a 3/4 '' bar of black . The screen is n't cut off , it just squeezes everything into the smaller space and messes up the aspect ratio . While I can manually change the V-Size on the back , this is a pain in the ass , and it just should n't happen anyway . I 've called Gateway numerous times and they have n't been able to help me at all . Two different times they sent me a new card , and both times the new card did n't work at all in my computer . They even tried to bill me for the first card because they did n't get it back in a couple of days , when they TOLD me over the phone that they would wait more than 2 weeks before billing my card . But their customer support is a different story ... So , if anyone has had this same problem , please let me know if you know what to do . Hell , let me know if you do n't have a solution , just so I know I'm not the only one with this problem . Thanks in advance . Jude M. Greer jmgree01 @ starbase.spd.louisville.edu P.S . I already tried going into the MACH 32 install program and manually set- ting up the card . Does n't work . Whenever I try to increase the vertical size of the 800x600 screen , it just starts to cut off the top and bottom .

Preliminary data regarding similar research into kangaroo overpopulation in Australia do not in any way support the cost-effectiveness of this approach . It _may_ be cost-effective for deer -- if you quietly overlook the fact that the net cost to the state of deer hunting is _negative_ ( i.e . a profit ) because the ( majority of ) hunters pay for licences . The cost comparisons are probably being done assuming that people have to be employed to cull the animals , which is not in fact the case . You figure people are going to pay for licences to implant contraceptive pellets or spread baits ? There has been a fair bit of discussion about this here recently , because the kangaroo population in the grounds of the Governor- General 's residence has now reached plague proportions . Despite the whines of the rampant animal-libbers , the most effective method of controlling the population is still considered to be controlled shooting . > So , now why should we allow hunting ... to prevent over-population of > the deer/bear/ < whatever > ?

Some people take satisfaction ( IMHO , legitimate satisfaction ) in eating food that they have harvested themselves . The pleasure derived from hunting is the same as that you get from eating fruit and vegetables grown in your own garden ( and , in general , game meat is probably much freer of unpleasant chemicals than what you buy from the butcher or the supermarket ) . > That may be a motivation , but it > can not now be justified .

It is extremely easy to use , make reports , etc . I own both it and Paradox , and I almost never use Paradox . If you need to build up a complicated application , then Paradox is the way to go . I have heard horror stories about the Access programming being extremely cryptic . Since you seem like you will probably be doing fairly small stuff ( work/ home use and you have not used a database before ) , I recommend Approach . I have found only one small thing which I would like it to do more easily : I have one database where the order in which the records are entered must be different than what is the logical ordering . To permanently reorder ( to use the old DBASE III command ) the records requires sorting the records appropriately ( no problem , since I almost always use them in this order ) exporting the database to another database ( which can still be an Approach database ) , and then copying the exported files back to the original filename . This is a small weakness , considering the other items I really like about Approach . It is also a little slower than Paradox ( other than the loading , Paradox takes forever and a minute to load ) . Paradox also takes a lot of memory ( both hard disk ( around 12MB ) and RAM ) . Greg Bishop . ( bishop @ baeyer.chem.fsu.edu )

Miller was convicted of owning a sawed-off shotgun and not paying the NFA '34 tax . Snatches of the court 's decision : The Second Amendment was intended to `` assure the continuation and render possible the effectiveness of such a force [ the militia ] ... It must be interpreted and applied with that end in view . '' The militia includes `` all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense . '' However , regarding sawed-off shotguns , `` certainly it is not within judicial notice that this weapon is any part of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense .

Here is my quandary : you seem to be arguing that certain types of guns fall outside the scope of the Second . This is n't a useful argument unless you believe that some significant gun or class of gun belongs in that class . I think we both agree that zip guns probably are n't protected . Maybe we also both agree that all the weapons that random state governments have been banning or trying to ban because they have `` no sporting purpose '' and `` no provate citizen would ever need these guns '' DO fall under the protection of the Second . So , given that damn near any gun of any practical utility is or has at some time been used by the military , even if only for marksmanship training purposes , I need to understand why you are intent on pressing this point , arguing that that SOMETHING is not protected by the Second . > Just because I do n't whole-heartedly endorse the NRA position does not > mean that I oppose the RKBA .

McNall has demonstrated with Gretzky that a star brings out the crowds whether or not the team is expected to do well . Very few fans real- istically expect the Kings to do well this year ( although I do ) and yet they still go out to see Gretzky . This is the marketing strategy - selling the game by selling the stars - that is employed by Baseball and , notably , the NBA and this is the attitude that the new Bettman/McNall leadership is bringing to the league . They have gone on record as stating that they are trying to sell the game on its stars . Timo Salami and Brett Hull are perfect examples of players that real fans know are n't worth a damn and yet , being benificiaries of marketing-oriented coaching strategies , have goal totals that would indicate to the casual observer , the very fans the NHL wants to attract , that these players are indeed superstars . > > They made the transaction to try and build a winner around Mario , that is > > true .

They ignore the fact that areas with the strictest gun control ( NYC , DC ) have the worst crime and areas with little gun control ( VT , NH , ID ) have very little crime in comparison . But they have to ignore this because otherwise they would need to confront the fact that law-abiding citizens who own guns are not the ones that are causing most of the trouble in society .

Lines : 11 NNTP-Posting-Host : wampyr.cc.uow.edu.au Keywords : polygons , splitting , clipping The idea is to clip one polygon using another polygon ( not necessarily rectangular ) as a window . My problem then is in finding out all the new vertices of the resulting `` subpolygons '' from the first one . Is this simply a matter of extending the usual algorithm whereby each of the edges of one polygon is checked against another polygon ? ? ? Is there a simpler way ? ? Comments welcome . Noel .

As usual , the bias of the 'Center for Policy Research ' echoes through this newsgroup . Here we have an enraged Likudnik who is venting his spleen , and you portray it as if this is going to become policy . You do n't say what the response to Matza's suggestion was . Do do not mention whether he was refering to terrorists caught in the act , which could be a clear cut case of self-defence . Would you care to elaborate on this , or was this all you wanted to say on the matter . Why do n't you give up this 'Center for Policy Research ' crap , and just post your biases without trying to legitimize them with a pompous name ? > Ha'aretz , 16 March1993 : > > Today a private security firm and units from the IDF Southern > Command will begin installation of four magnetic gates in the Gaza > strip , as an additional stage in the upgrading of security > measures in the Strip . > > The gates will aid in the searching of [ non-Jewish ] Gaza residents > as they leave for work in Israel .

A laudable precaution . Every single thing you post about Israel is posted to portray Israel as negatively as you can . Deliberate omissions are an integral part of the shtick . And it 's not only the incidents that you do not mention , but even the stories you do post are fraught with omissions , which change the entire meaning . The absurdity of your respectable name can not hide your bias . In your effort to portray Israel in an unfavorable light , you have accomplished nothing , except to prove that a respectable sounding label like the Center for Policy Research is nothing but a smoke screen for someone with a heavily biased attitude against Israel and the need to vent it .

Americans have become so insensitive to the needs of others and so completely wrapped up in themselves that they can not see straight or think clearly enough to make even the slightest and most obvious moral decisions based on reality . If a man abandons a woman to care for their child on her own , he is not considered to be a very respectable or decent man by anyone . This man has fled his responsibility , has behaved like a lazy coward , and has turned away from his responsibility to his wife and child . However , if a woman decides to kill her unborn child to release her burden , she is not thought of in the same way . When the man abandons , the woman suffers but the child is free to grow up and live a happy and normal life . When the woman abandons , the child is diced or killed with saline or vacuumed out , and the man has no choice , and the man sometimes suffers so badly that he wishes he could trade places with his child . Ths root of this whole problem is selfishness -- the arrogance that says , `` My feelings and desires are supreme and your well being is not worth dung .

As it is now , we do n't see our responsibility because we kill it and get it out of sight . The media backs us completely . Real responsibility does not sell . The only '' responsibility '' that sells in the marketplace is that which is just enough to make us `` feel responsible '' without showing anything that might show us our own true irresponsibility . We want to `` feel '' like good people , but we want nothing with *being* good people . Just give me the freedom to say `` I 'm good '' , and the rest of the world can burn . Rape and kill my children and throw my parents to the places where poor old folks rot until they 're dead . I 'll hate my brother and sister if I wish and I 'll cheat on my wife or husband . Screw the government , because it screws me , and do n't talk to me about giving to the church because church people are all a bunch of money grubbing hypocrites . But , I 'm a good person . At least I admit what I do . At least I love myself and we all know that is the greatest love in the world -- not that a man lay down his life for his brother ... That sounds too `` christian '' . At the root , this is the substance of what hell is made of . We 've become a self indulgant , backslidden society no longer responsible to our children , to our parents , to our families , to our government , or to our God . This is the root behind justification of every evil , of every corruption in government , of every slanderous remark , of every lie , and of every murder .

No , but they could compell you to produce the key to a safe where , as it happens , evidence that will convict you is stored . The crypto-key disclosure issue has n't come up yet , but current law suggests that it 's a loser for the defendant -- he 'll be compelled to turn over the key . The test for compelled self-incrimination is whether the material to be disclosed *in itself* tends to inculpate the discloser . In the example I gave above , the safe key itself has no testimonial value -- ergo , it can be disclosed under compulsion ( e.g. , subpoena duces tecum ) . Moreover , the government can always immunize the disclosure of a crypto key -- compelling you to disclose the key at the price of not using the fact of your disclosure as evidence in the case against you . Of course , they can use whatever they discover as a result of this disclosure against you . -- Mike -- Carl Kadie -- I do not represent any organization ; this is just me . = kadie @ cs.uiuc.edu =

From : heart @ access.digex.com ( G ) Subject : cholistasis ( sp ? ) /fat-free diet/pregnancy ! ! Organization : Express Access Online Communications , Greenbelt , MD USA Lines : 80 NNTP-Posting-Host : access.digex.net Hi , I 've just returned from a visit with my OB/GYN and I have a few concerns that maybe y'all can help me with . I 've been seeing her every 4 weeks for the past few months ( I 'm at week 28 ) and during the last 2 visits I 've gained 9 to 9 1/2 pounds every 4 weeks . She said this was unacceptable over any 4 week period . As it stands I 've thus far gained 26 pounds . Also she says that though I 'm at 28 weeks the baby 's size is 27 weeks , I think she mentioned 27 inches for the top of the fundus . When I was 13 weeks the baby 's size was 14 weeks . I must also add , that I had an operation a few years ago for endometriosis and I 've had no problems with endometriosis but apparently it is causing me pain in my pelvic region during the pregnancy , and I have a very difficult time moving , and the doc has recommended I not walk or move unless I have to . ( I have a little handicapped sticker for when I do need to go out . ) Anyway that 's 1/2 of the situation the other is that almost from the beginning of pregnancy I was getting sick ( throwing up ) about 2-3 times a day and mostly it was bile that was being eliminated . ( I told her about this ) . I know this because I was n't eating very much due to the nausea and could see the 'results ' . Well now I only get sick about once every 1-2 weeks , and it is still bile related . But in addition I had begun to feel movement near my upper right abdomen , just below the right breast , usually when I was lying on my right side . It began to get worse though because it started to hurt when I lay on my right side , and then it hurt no matter what position I was in . Next , I noticed that when I ate greasy or fatty foods I felt like my entire abdomen had turned to stone , and the pain in the area got worse . However if I ate sauerkraut or vinegar or something to 'cut ' the fat it was n't as much of a problem . So the doctor says I have cholistatis , and that I should avoid fatty foods . This makes sense , and because I was already aware of what seemed to me this cause and effect relationship I have been avoiding these foods on my own . But I 'm still able to eat foods with Ricotta cheese for instance and other low fat foods . But doc wants me to be on a non-fat diet . This means no meat except fish and chicken w/o skin ( I do this anyway ) . No nuts , fried food , cheese etc . I am allowed skim milk . She said I should avoid anything sweet ( e.g . bananas ) . Also I must only have one serving of something high in carbohydrates a day ( potatoes , pasta , rice ) ! She said I ca n't even cook vegetables in a little bit of oil and that I should eat vegetables raw or steamed . I 'm concerned because I understand you need to have some fat in your diet to help in the digestive process . And if I 'm not taking in fat , is she expecting the baby will take it from my stores ? And why this restriction on carbohydrates if she 's concerned about fat ? I 'm not clear how much of her recommendation is based on my weight gain and how much on cholistatis , which I ca n't seem to find any information on . She originally said that I should only gain 20 pounds during the entire pregnancy since I was about 20 lbs overweight when I started . But my sister gained 60 lbs during her pregnancy and she 's taken it all off and has n't had any problems . She also asked if any members of my family were obese , which none of them are . Anyway I think she is overly concerned about weight gain , and feel like I 'm being 'punished ' by a severe diet . She did want to see me again in one week so I think she the diet may be temporary for that one week . What I want to know is how reasonable is this non-fat diet ? I would understand if she had said low-fat diet , since I 'm trying that anyway , even if she said really low-fat diet . I think she assumes I must be eating a high-fat diet , but really it is that because of the endometriosis and the operation I 'm not able to use the energy from the food I do eat . Any opinions , info and experiences will be appreciated . I 'm truly going stark raving mad trying to meet this new strict diet because fruits and vegetables go through my system in a few minutes and I 'll end up having to eat constantly . Thus far I do n't find any foods satisfying . Thanks G

Tell me Tim , what are these guerillas doing wrong ? Assuming that they are using civilians for cover , are they not killing SOLDIERS in THEIR country ? If the buffer zone is to prevent attacks on Israel , is it not working ? Why is it further neccessary for Israeli guns to pound Lebanese villages ? Why not just kill those who try to infiltrate the buffer zone ? You see , there is more to the shelling of the villages ... . it is called RETALIATION ... `` GETTING BACK '' ... '' GETTING EVEN '' . It does n't make sense to shell the villages .

Tim , you are ignoring the fact that the Palestinians in Lebanon have been disarmed . Hezbollah remains the only independent militia . Hezbollah does not attack Israel except at a few times such as when the IDF burned up Sheikh Mosavi , his wife , and young son . Of course , if Israel would withdraw from Lebanon and stop assassinating people and shelling villages they wouldn't make the Lebanese so mad as to do that .

Israel knows very well that the Syrians are able to restrain ALL who would use territory under their control to attack Israel . While Lebanon would be better off with Syria and Israel out of its borders , the presence of Syrian troops in Lebanon has meant a sharp decrease in attacks on Israeli territory ( not on Israeli troops in Lebanon , however .

Quicktime does a much better job of playing back movies at size than it does playing back resized movies . Apparently the process of expanding each frame 's image and dithering the resultant bitmap to the appropriate bit depth is pretty processor-intensive . There are optimizers that work pretty well for showing movies at double size , but if you drop to 1.9x size or increase to 2.1x size , performance suffers dramatically . > Then I asked him what Mac he was using ... He was using a Quadra ( do n't know > what model , 900 ? ) to do it , and he was telling the guys there that the Quicktime > could play back at the same speed even on an LCII . He lied . : - ) Quicktime is very CPU dependent . He was probably confused by the fact that QT is locked to an internal timecode , and will play in the same amount of time on any machine . However , an LC will drop frames in order to keep the sound and video synced up . The Centris and Quadras have similar CPUs and will thus boast similar performance , though the Quadras will be a bit faster due to marginally faster clock speeds and somewhat different architecture . > Well , I spoiled his claim so to say , since a 68040 Quadra Mac was having > a little bit of trouble .

I expect that the version of the Quicktime software you saw was 1.0 -- I was using was 1.5 . One of the new codecs in v1.5 allows video at nearly twice the size and the same frame rate as what version 1.0 could handle . The Centris 650 I saw was a plain-vanilla , with the exception of the nice speakers that were playing the sound , and the software was Movie Player , the QT player Apple includes with the software . > Do n't misunderstand me , I just want to clarify this .

Several people responded with good information , but I do n't think I communicated exactly what I am looking for . I 'm working on a custom I/O device that will communicate with a host via RS-232 . My custom circuitry will use an 80C186EB or EC CPU and require about 64K of RAM ( preferably FLASH RAM ) . In looking around , I see that lots of people have engineered UART-CPU-ROM-RAM subsystems that are ready to be interfaced to your custom I/O devices . It 's been done so much , that it would be best if I can avoid reinventing a system . It just needs to use an 80C186 ( or 188 ) CPU , and be able to load a program from the host then transfer control to that program . Well , there 's one other thing the ROM needs to know how to do . It should have routines to send and receive bytes to/from the host , that utilize the hardware control lines ( DTR , RTS , DTS , CTS ) . Everything I 've seen is in the $ 200.00 and up range . That 's too much for this application . I need something around $ 100.00 . The CPU has the UART built-in , so you 're only looking at a few chips . Does anyone know a company that markets a good board in this range , or some public domain circuitry I can use ? Thanks in advance for the info . Rich

Gee , I got the idea from somewhere that devices like this were in common use in WWII , so that commanders on board ships could bellow at the troops landing on a beach , for example . Which reminds me of an anecdote from the mid-60s . At a communications conference a Marine Corps communications officer said he did n't care much for all the spread-spectrum multi-access expensive communication systems that people were talking about at the time ; what he wanted was a kilowatt broadcast transmitter on the ship and a $ 4.95 Japanese transistor radio stuck in the ear of every Marine hitting the beach . -- haynes @ cats.ucsc.edu haynes @ cats.bitnet '' Ya can talk all ya wan na , but it 's dif'rent than it was !

I think this is a little inaccurate , based on Feynman 's account of the software-development process *before* the standdown . Fred is basically correct : no sophisticated tools , just a lot of effort and painstaking care . But they got this one right *before* Challenger ; Feynman cited the software people as exemplary compared to the engine people . ( He also noted that the software people were starting to feel management pressure to cut corners , but had n't had to give in to it much yet . ) Among other things , the software people worked very hard to get things right for the major pre-flight simulations , and considered a failure during those simulations to be nearly as bad as an in-flight failure . As a result , the number of major-simulation failures could be counted on one hand , and the number of in-flight failures was zero . As Fred mentioned elsewhere , this applies only to the flight software . Software that runs experiments is typically mostly put together by the experimenters , and gets nowhere near the same level of Tender Loving Care . ( None of the experimenters could afford it . ) -- All work is one man 's work . | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology - Kipling | henry @ zoo.toronto.edu utzoo ! henry

From A Dictionary of Philosophy , by Anthony Flew : '' Objectivism : The belief that there are certain moral truths that would remain true whatever anyone or everyone thought or desired . For instance , 'No one should ever deliberately inflict pain on another simply to take pleasure in his suffering ' might be thought of as a plausible example . Even in a world of sadists who all rejected it , the contention remains true , just as ' 5 + 7 = 12 ' remains correct even if there is no one left to count . The problem for the objectivist is to determine the status of moral truths and the method by which they can be established . If we accept that such judgements are not reports of what is but only relate to what ought to be ( see naturalistic fallacy ) then they can not be proved by any facts about the nature of the world . Nor can they be analytic , since this would involve lack of action-guiding content ; 'One ought always to do the right thing ' is plainly true in virtue of the vords involved but it is unhelpful as a practical guide to action ( see analytic and synthetic ) . At this point the objectivist may talk of 'self-evident truths ' , but can he deny the subjectivist 's claim that self-evidence is in the mind of the beholder ? If not , what is left of the claim that some moral judgements are true ? THe subjectivist may well feel that all that remains is that there are some moral judgements with which he would wish to associate himself . To hold a moral opinion is , he suggests , not to know something to be true but to have preferences regarding human activity . '' David Nye ( nyeda @ cnsvax.uwec.edu ) .

Does anone have any information I 'm not sure that this condition is `` recognised '' anywhere ( in the sense of a disease with diagnostic criteria , clear boundaries between it and other diseases , unique pathologic or physiologic features , etc ) , but here goes with what many neurologists agree on . Post-polio syndrome patients have evidence of motor neuron disease by clinical examination , EMG , and muscle biopsy . The abnormalities are mostly chronic ( due to old polio ) but there is evidence of ongoing deterioration . Clinically , the patients complain of declining strength and endurance with everyday motor tasks . Musculoskeletal pain is a nearly universal feature that doubtless contributes to the impaired performance . The examination shows muscle weakness and atrophy . The EMG shows evidence of old denervation with reinnervation ( giant and long-duration motor unit action potentials ) *and* evidence of active denervation ( fibrillation potentials ) . The biopsy also shows old denervation with reinnervation ( fiber-type grouping ) *and* evidence of active denervation ( small , angulated fibers with dense oxidative enzyme staining ) - but curiously , little or no group atrophy . Post-polio patients do not have ALS . In ALS , there is clinically evident deterioration from one month to the next . In post-polio , the patients are remarkably stable in objective findings from one year to the next . Of course , there are patients who had polio before who develop genuine ALS , but ALS is no more common among polio survivors than among people who never had polio . The cause of post-polio syndrome is unknown . There is little evidence that post-polio patients have active polio virus or destructive immunologic response to virus antigen . There is no solid evidence that patients with post-polio have anything different happening to the motor unit ( anterior horn cells , motor axons , neuromuscular junctions , and muscle fibers ) than patients with old polio who are not complaining of deterioration . Both groups can have the same EMG and biopsy findings . The reason for these `` acute '' changes in a `` chronic '' disease ( old polio ) is unknown . Possibly spinal motor neurons ( that have reinnervated huge numbers of muscle fibers ) start shedding the load after several years . There are a couple of clinical features that distinguish post-polio syndrome patients from patients with old polio who deny deterioration . The PPS patients are more likely to have had severe polio . The PPS patients are *much* more likely to complain of pain . They also tend to score higher on depression scales of neuropsychologic tests . My take on this ( I 'm sure some will disagree ) : after recovery from severe polio there can be abnormal loading on muscles , tendons , ligaments , bones , and joints , that leads to inflammatory and/or degenerative conditions affecting these structures . The increasing pain , superimposed on the chronic ( but unchanging ) weakness , leads to progressive impairment of motor performance and ADL . I am perhaps biased by personal experience of having never seen a PPS patient who was not limited in some way by pain . I do not believe that PPS patients have more rapid deterioration of motor units than non-PPS patients ( i.e. , those with old polio of similar severity but without PPS complaints ) . -- - .

He 's setting himself up to be in hot water . Indeed . Reading the cases of people who 've tried the various things Mr. Teel suggests show that defendants fall into two classes : ( 1 ) those who win on procedural grounds or some grounds not related to their claim , and ( 2 ) those who lose . Consider Newman v. Schiff , 778 F.2d 460 ( 8th Cir.1985 ) , which I 've seen cited by tax protestors other than Mr. Teel as a win for Mr. Schiff . Mr. Schiff offered $ 100,000 on TV to anyone who would call in the show and cite any section of the Internal Revenue Code that says that an individual has to file a return . Mr. Newman took him up on it . Mr. Newman had seen the show in a rebroadcast the next morning . Mr. Schiff claimed that the offer only extended to people who actually say the original broadcast , and so there was no offer for Mr. Newman to accept , and so no unilateral contract was formed , and so Mr. Schiff did not have to pay $ 100,000 . Mr. Schiff was correct , and so won . So , yes , Mr. Schiff won against a claim on the $ 100,000 reward . However , his win had nothing to do with the tax code . -- Tim Smith

From : asket @ acad2.alaska.edu Subject : When is a couple married ... Organization : University of Alaska Lines : 31 I used to be a marriage commissioner for the Alaska Court System ( sort of a justice of the peace ) . I had great difficulty with that duty . I used to pray earnestly in the courthouse bathroom before the ceremonies , mostly asking that the couples would come to appreciate and fulfill the true holiness and divine purpose in marriage -- couples who obviously did n't realize that marriage is God 's institution , not the state 's . Gradually , however , I came to conclude that because I was acting in a strictly secular , public capacity , established as such by both the state and the expectations of the couples involved , I was really conducting a purely secular , legal civil event , with no greater moral or religious implications than if I had been conducting a civil trial ( the couple who told me , mid-ceremony , to `` please hurry it up '' may have helped me to this conclusion ) . I thought I had neatly rationalized a clear and sharp distinction between marriage before God , and `` marriage '' before the state , until I had to deal with my own divorce . Keeping Matthew 19:6 in mind , I felt that the state had no business dissolving my marriage established before God , but of course it assumed jurisdiction nonetheless . I would ask those of you proposing answers to this question to consider this issue 's logical extension : If intercourse , or the mental intent of the parties , or the ceremony of the church , or any combination thereof , establishes marriage , then at what moment is it dissolved ?

From : dscheck @ nextsrv1.andi.org ( David Scheck ) Subject : Imake cpp problems on AIX Keywords : imake Organization : PRC , Inc. Lines : 29 I am trying to build and use imake ( X11R4 ) on an IBM RS/6000 running AIX V3.2 . I am having the following 2 problems . ( 1 ) Many of my Imakefile 's have contructs like /**/ # This is a makefile at the start of lines to pass Makefile comments thru the C preprocessor and into the Makefile . Most of the C preprocessors that I have used will not treat such a # as appearing at the start of the line . Thus the C preprocessor does not treat the hash symbol as the start of a directive . However the IBM cpp strips the comment and treats the hash symbol as the start of a directive . The cpp fails when it determines that `` This '' is not a known directive . I have temporarily hacked my imake to handle this situation but would like to come up with a better fix . ( 2 ) Several Imakefiles use /**/ as a parameter to a macro when a particular use of the macro does not need a value for the parameter . The AIX cpp gives warnings about these situations but continues to work OK . If you are familiar with these problems and have solutions , I would appreciate information about on your solutions . ( Perhaps , this is solved in a later version of imake that I have not reviewed . ) Also , do you know of other cpp's that behave similarly ? Since I do not have easy access to News , a response to 'white_billy @ po.gis.prc.com ' would be appreciated .

Lines : 19 I recently learned about these devices that supposedly induce specific brain wave frequencies in their users simply by wearing them . Mind machines consist of LED gogles , head phones , and a microprocessor that controls them . They strobe the ( closed ) eye and send sound pulses in sync with the flashing LEDs . I understand that these devices are experimental , but they are available . I 've heard claims that they can induce sleep , and light trance states for relaxation . Essentially they are supposed to work without aid of drugs etc ... I would think that if they work as reported they would be incredibly useful , The few sources I 've seen are biased ( they are selling the things , and a friend who has tried them claims that `` every home should have one '' ) . So do these mind machines ( aka Light and Sound machines ) work ? can they induce alpha , theta , and/or delta waves in a person wearing them ? What research if any has been done on them ? Could they be used in lieu of a tranquilizer ? Or are they just another bit of quackery ? Web Homer homer @ tripos.com

I could n't find a definite place for myself in the pool at work because I , I 'll just say it , could n't steal , could n't deceive , and could n't be involved in bribe-taking . And when I asked for decent working conditions they told me , `` Leave , do n't keep the others from working , you are n't cut out for this kind of work . '' And at work and around all the time I would hear gibes at the Armenians , like `` The Turks had it right , they killed them all -- the way they 've multiplied here they 're making it hard for us to live , '' and `` Things will be just fine if we get rid of them all . '' `` No problem , the Turks will help , '' they say , `` if we ask them , they 'll rid Armenia of Armenians in half an hour .

Here we 've been living under the Soviet government for 70 years , and no one even considered such an idea possible . But I had been forming my own opinions , and in the presence of authoritative people I would often ask , `` Where is this all leading , do people really not see what kind of situation is emerging here . The Russians are fleeing Sumgait , there are very few of them left . Why is no one dealing with this , what 's going on ? '' And when it all happened on the 27th and 28th , it became clear that everything had been arranged by someone , because what else are you to make of it if the First Secretary of the City Party Committee is marching ahead of the demonstration with an Azerbaijani flag ? I would n't be saying this now if I had n't received personal confirmation from him later . Because when we were under guard in the SK club on the 1st , he came to the club , that Muslimzade . The women told me , `` There he is , there he is , that 's Muslimzade . '' I did n't believe the rumors that he had carried an Azerbaijani flag . I thought that they were just false rumors . I went over to him and said , `` Are you the First Secretary of our City Party Committee ? '' He answers me , `` Yes . '' And I ask him , '' Tell me , did you really march ahead of that gang carrying an Azerbaijani flag , and behind you they were carrying denigrating signs , I do n't know exactly what they said , but there was mention of Armenian blood ? '' And he tells me , `` Yes , I was there , but I tried to dissuade them from it . '' Then I asked him another question : `` And where were you when they were burning and slaughtering us ? And he said , `` I. . . We did n't know what to do , we did n't know , we did n't anticipate that that would happen in Sumgait . '' Comrade Mamedov , the First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Azerbaijani SSR , answered the same question for me : `` No , we actually did n't anticipate the slaughter in Sumgait . At that time we were trying to contain the crowd of 45,000 in Baku that was preparing for a massacre . '' Those are his exact words , the ones he said in the office of the Council of Ministers of the Armenian SSR . And now , about the events themselves . Of course it 's painful to discuss them , because it may seem that it 's not true to someone else . Various rumors concerning what happened are making the rounds : some are true , others are n't . But unfortunately there are more true ones than false , because it was so horrible : in our age , here in the space age , the age of science , the age of progress , I do n't know , if someone had told me this story , if I were living in or around Moscow , I would n't have believed it . Why not ? Because it was really a genocide , it was a massacre . That 's genuinely what it was . For example , on that day , the 28th -- I did n't know about the 27th because my husband and I were both sick , both of us had the flu , and we were in bed -- on the 28th our neighbor comes to our place and says , `` You 're in bed ? You do n't know anything about it ? There was a demonstration in town , and after it they were overturning Armenian cars and burning them . They were looking into cars and asking , 'Are you an Armenian ? ' If they answered in Armenian , then they turned the car over and burned it . '' This is n't made up , the wife of the Senior Investigator of the Baku Ministry of Internal Affairs told us . He was returning home from his dacha with his wife , Raisa Sevastyanova , she 's my neighbor . She immediately came and told LIS that they had landed right in the middle of it , I do n't know what to call it , the cavalcade of automobiles they were stopping . He answered in Azerbaijani , they let them go , but they made him honk the horn , they were kicking up a fracas . We did n't even believe it , and I said , `` Certainly that did n't happen , how can that be ? '' And she said , '' Muslimzade was leading the crowd , and the Sputnik store was completely smashed because most of the salespeople there are Armenians . And when he saw that they had started breaking the glass in that store , he said , `` Do n't break the shop windows , do n't destroy state property , but do whatever else you want. '' I did n't hear this with my own two ears , but it is a fact that the store was torn up and the director of the store was beaten for employing Armenians although he 's an Azerbaijani . While we were talking , all of a sudden right across from us . . . Sevastyanova is the first to look out the window and say , `` Look , there 's a crowd out there . '' And sure enough , when we looked out there we saw that the crowd had already started wrecking the neighboring building . There was an Armenian family there , a woman and two girls . They lived across from us . I 'm sorry , I do n't know the building number or the people 's names , since we were in my husband 's apartment , in Microdistrict 8 , and I lived in Microdistrict No . 3 . There was awful looting going on there at the time , the most hideous things were going on there then . One building there , ours , was attacked twice , once was n't enough for them . They returned to the places where they had n't finished the Armenians off . If an Azerbaijani family dared to conceal Armenians , they beat the Azerbaijanis too . They also beat Russians , if it was Russians doing the hiding . Because there were Russians among them , they said so on television , there were people of various nationalities . But they did n't tell us why there were people of different nationalities . Because they would n't have touched the Azerbaijanis if they had n't dared to stick up for the Armenians and give them temporary shelter in their homes . At the time I saw this from the window I was there , Sevastyanova was there , and so was my husband . We went out onto the balcony and saw a television fly off a balcony . All kinds of things , even a sofa . Then , when it was all down there , they burned it up . Then we saw the crowd , and they were all oohing . At first I could n't figure out what was happening . And later I told my husband , '' Lendrush , l think they 're beating someone out there . '' And he answered , `` I do n't know , could be . '' Suddenly the crowd separated for a moment , and I saw it , and Raisa Sevastyanova saw it too . My husband had turned the other way , he did n't see it . I saw a naked girl with her hair down . They were dragging her . She kept falling because they were pushing her and kicking her . She fell down , it was muddy there , and later other witnesses who saw it from their balconies told us , they seized her by the hair and dragged her a couple of blocks , as far as the mortgage bank , that 's a good block and a half or two from here . I know this for sure because I saw it myself . Then the crowd rushed toward our building . We were standing there , and you can of course imagine what we were feeling . Were they going to kill us or not ? And I also had the awful thought that they might torment me the way they tormented that woman , because I had just seen that . I asked my husband . I gave him an axe and said , `` You kill me first , and then let them do what they want with the corpse . '' But our neighbors , it 's true , defended us , they said , `` There are n't any Armenians in our entryway , go away , only Muslims live here . '' Disaster missed us that time . But at two o'clock in the morning a crowd of about 15 people , approximately , came back to our place . My husband was already asleep . He can sleep when he 's upset about something , but I ca n't . I was standing , running from balcony to balcony . Our power was out , I do n't remember for how long , but it was as though it had been deliberately turned off . There were no lights whatsoever , and I was glad , of course . I thought it was better that way . But then I look and the crowd is at our balcony . This was at 2:15 in the morning . The first time they were at our building it was 6:30 , and now it was 2:15 in the morning . But I never thought that that old woman on the first floor , the Azerbaijani , was awake and watching out , there were human beings among them too . So she goes out with a pail of garbage , as though she needed to be taking garbage out at two o'clock in the morning . She used it as a pretext and went toward those young people . They really were youngsters . From my balcony you could see perfectly that they were young Azerbaijani boys . They spoke Azerbaijani . And when they came up to her she said , `` What do you want ? '' And they answered , `` We want the Armenian family that lives here '' [ pointing toward the second floor with their hands ] . She says , `` I already told you , we do n't have any Armenians here , now leave , do you hear , this is an old Muslim woman talking to you , '' and grabbed the hand of one boy who was trying to walk around her and enter the building anyway and started pushing him away . And so they seemed to listen to her . They were all very young , they started apologizing and left . That was the second time death was at our door . I forgot to mention about one other apartment , a man named Rubik lives there , I do n't know him really , I knew his daughter , I mean I saw her around , but we really did n't know them . But I do know that that guy who lives on the fourth floor across from our entryway went to Chernobyl and worked there for eight months , to earn money . Can you imagine what that means ? He risked his life to earn X amount of money in order to better his family . He bought new furniture and was getting ready to give his daughter 's hand in marriage , but , alas , everything was ruined by those creeps and scoundrels . They threw everything out the windows , and the rest we saw from our balcony : how the neighbors on the left and right ran into the apartment and carried off everything that had n't already been smashed or taken . What is one to think of that ? It means that the parents in those families were in on it too . Unfortunately I came to be of the opinion that it was all organized and that everything had been foreseen in advance : both the beating of the Armenians and the stripping of apartments . Something on the order of `` We 'll move the Armenians out and take over their apartments . '' I have worked honestly my whole life , you can check everything about me . I came as a patriot from China , waited for nights on end in front of the Consulate General of the USSR , I came to my homeland as a patriot because I knew that the Party and the Komsomol were holy things . But when I saw in Sumgait that there was n't anything holy about them , that Party membership was bought , that Komsomol members joined only for personal gain , that there were no ideals , no ideas , God save me , everything was being bought and sold , I saw all of it and understood how they could allow that crap to go on like it did . I ca n't talk any more about it . . . the image of that beating . . . When I went out of my own apartment -- they picked us up under Soviet Army guard , they had arrived from all over to suppress that gang -- not only Armenians , but some Russian families and their children , too , came out of their apartments and joined us , because no normal person who had seen that could stay there with the situation the way it was . And what 's interesting is that when we left on the buses I rode and thought that at least one group of people , for sure people would basically rise to the situation , would have some compassion for the Armenians , would somehow understand the injustice of what was done . But having analyzed and weighed the whole thing , once I calmed down , having thought it all through , I came to a conclusion that is shared by many people . If a lot of Azerbaijanis did n't want their Armenian neighbors to be killed , and that basically depended on that Muslimzade -- he said that he had wanted to calm them down -- then is it possible that he did n't have people at hand to whom he could whisper at the last minute , `` Go and announce it on television : Citizens of Sumgait ! Take what you can into your hands , let 's protect our neighbors from this massacre ? '' Those crowds were n't such that there was no controlling them . Basically they were unarmed . They did n't have firearms , mostly they had knives , they had all kinds of metal parts , like armature shafts , sharpened at the ends , special rocks , different to a degree that we noticed them : there are n't rocks like those in Sumgait soils , they were brought from somewhere , as though it were all specially planned . So as I was saying , I weighed it all out and if any of our neighbors had wanted to defend us , why was n't it arranged ? It means that the government did n't want to do it . When the crowd was moving from the City Party Committee to the Sputnik , what , there was no way of informing Baku ? No , there was no way , it turns out ! The crowd was doing violence in our microdistrict . I wo n't mention the things I did n't see myself , I 'll only talk about the things I myself witnessed . They were in Microdistrict 8 beginning at 6 o'clock in the evening , when I saw them from the other building , and they were somewhere else until mid-night or one o'clock in the morning , because at 2:15 they came back to our building . They had n't completely finished making their predatory rounds of Microdistrict 8 . When they returned to our building I told my husband , `` Lendrush , now the police are probably going to come , my God , now the authorities are probably going to find out and come to our aid . '' Well , alas , no , there were to be no authorities , not a single policeman , not a single fireman , not a single ambulance came while they were raging , as it turns out , as we later found out , beginning on the Might of the 27th . There were dead people , ruined apartments , and burned autos : one car near the bus station , it was burned and overturned , it was probably there about four days , everyone saw it and what went on in Block 45 ! Those who live there know , they saw from their balconies how they attacked the soldiers in the buses , how they beat those poor , unarmed soldiers , and how on that square , I ca n't remember the name of it , where there is that fork coming from the bus station , that intersection , now I 'm upset and I ca n't think of the name . . . there 's a tall building there , a 9-story , and from the balconies there people saw that butchery , when the poor soldiers , wearing only helmets , with shields and those unfortunate clubs , moved against that mob . And when they fell , those 12-to 14-year-old boys ran up and using stones , big heavy stones , beat them to death on their heads . Who could have guessed that something like that could happen in the Soviet Union and under the Soviet government ? The upshot is that this republic has not been under Soviet control for a long time , but no one wanted to pay any attention or get involved . If you were to go and ask at my work many people would confirm that I tell the truth , I 've been struggling for truth for five years there already , the five years that I worked at the Azerbaijani railroad . Some people there considered me a demagogue , others who knows what ; some think I 'm an adventure seeker , and some , a prankster . But I wanted everything to be right , I would become outraged : how can this be , why is it people treat one another this way on a Soviet railroad , as though the Azerbaijani railroad were Azerbaijani property , or the property of some magnate , or some `` mafia '' : If I want to , I 'll get you out of here ; If I want to , I 'll get rid of you ; If I want to , I 'll do something else ? And there 's a black market price for everything , in the most brazen way : a coach to Moscow costs so much , a coach on a local train costs so much . Once when I was complaining to the head of the conductor 's pool , he had the nerve to tell me , maybe you wo n't even believe this , but this , I 'm afraid , I heard with my own ears : `` Tatyana , just how long can you fight for something that you know will never have any effect ? You 're alone against everyone , so instead why do n't you give more money to the chief conductor , and everything will go fine for you . '' I started to cry , turned , and left . What else could I do , where else could I go to complain ? I realized that everything was useless . And the root of the whole thing is that it all goes on and no one wants to see it . I filed a written complaint , and they ground it into dust , they destroyed it , I still have a copy , but what 's the use ? When the General Procuracy got involved with the investigation of the bloody Sumgait affair , in addition to the information about what I saw , what I was a witness to , I gave testimony about the mafia at the railroad . They accepted my petition , but I do n't know if they 're going to pursue it or not . Because , you 'll excuse me , I no longer believe in the things I aspired to , the things I believed in before : It 's all dead . They just spit on my soul , stomped on everything , physically , and most important , spiritually , because you can lose belongings , that 's nonsense , that all comes with time , but when your soul is spit upon and when the best in you -- your beliefs -- are destroyed , it can be very difficult to restore them ... I want to tell of one incident . I just do n't know , at the time I was in such a state that I did n't even take minor things into account . Here is an example . Of course , it 's not a minor one . My neighbor , Raisa Sevastyanova , she has a son , Valery , who is in the 9th grade in a school in Microdistrict 8 . A boy , Vitaly [ Danielian ] , I do n't know his last name , goes to school with him , or rather , went to school with him . I was just sitting in an apartment trying to make a phone call to Moscow . . . Oh yes , and there 's one important detail : When the massacre began , for two to three hours the phones were n't working in Armenian apartments , and later , in several Russian and Azerbaijani apartments . But the fact of the matter is that service was shut off , you could not call anywhere . Why ? Again , it means it was all planned . How come service is cut off for no reason ? And the lights went off . And those brats were raging as they liked They were n't afraid , they ran about freely , they that no one would slap their hands and no one would dare to stop them . They knew it . Now I 'm going to tell about the incident . So this little Vitaly , Vitalik , an Armenian boy , went to school with Valery ; they were in the same class . According to what Valery and his neighbor pal said -- at the time I was in the same apartment as they were , I sat at the phone waiting for the call to be put through -- a mob attacked the building where Vitalik lived . So Valery ran to his mother and said , `` Mamma , please let me go to Vitalik 's , what if they kill him ? Maybe he 's still alive , maybe we can bring him here and save him somehow . . . . He 's a nice guy , we all like him , he 's a good person , he 's smart . '' His mother would n't let him go . In tears , she says , `` Valery , you ca n't go because I am afraid . '' He says , `` Mamma , we can get around the crowd . We 'll just watch , just have a look . '' They made it through . I do n't know , I think Vitalik's parents lived in Microdistrict No . 1 , and when they got there , they made a superficial deduction . Knowing that balconies and doors were being broken everywhere , that you could see from the street which were the Armenian apartments in the building , they went here and there and looked , and saw that the windows were intact , and so they calmed down . But even though the windows in that apartment were not broken , everything inside was totally smashed , and Vitalik lay there with a broken skull , and his mother and father had already been murdered . Little Vitalik did n't even know they were dead . So two weeks ago , I do n't know , he was in critical condition , no , maybe it was longer : we left Sumgait on March 20 , spent some time in Moscow , and then we came to Yerevan . So it 's been about a month already ; it 's so hard to keep all this straight . So Valery , the next day , when he found out that Vitalik 's family has been killed and Vitalik was ling in the Semashko Hospital in Baku , Valery and his classmates got together and went to visit him . But they would n't admit them , telling them that he was in critical condition and that he was still in a coma . They cried and left , having also found out that the girl I saw being kicked and dragged was in that hospital too . As it turns out she was brought there in serious condition , but at least she was alive at the time . . . When we got to the SK club we would see first one friend and then another , throw ourselves into their arms and kiss them , because you had wondered if these friends were alive or not , if those friends were alive or not . . . And when you saw them you were so glad to find out that the family had lived ! When you saw people you heard things that made your hair stand on end . If you publish everything that happened it will be a hideous book . A book of things it is even difficult to believe . And those two girls who were raped were entirely black and blue , the ones at the SK , they know I 'm not lying , that girlfriend came up to one of them and said , `` What happened ? '' and she bared her breasts , and they were completely covered in cigarette burns . . . those rogues had put cigarettes out on her breasts . After something like that I do n't know how you can live in a city and look at the people in it . Now . . . When we stayed at the military unit for a while , they provided , well , basic conditions for us there . The military unit is located in Nasosny , some six miles from Sumgait . And living there we met with a larger group of people . There were about 1,600 people at the unit . You know , there was a point when I could n't even go outside because if you went outside you saw so much heartbreak around you . And when you hear the false rumors . . . Yes , by the way , false rumors were spread in Sumgait saying that the Armenians around Yerevan had destroyed Azerbaijani villages and razed them to the ground with bulldozers . I did n't know whether to believe it or not . And people who do n't know any better get the idea that it was all done in revenge . But when I arrived in Armenia and was in Spitak , and in Spitak all those villages are not only intact , but at that time had even been protected just in case , they were guarded , they got better food than did the inhabitants of Spitak . Not a single person there died , and no one is planning to harm them . Around Yerevan all the villages are safe and unharmed , and the Armenians did n't attack anyone . But actually , after an evil of the magnitude suffered in Sumgait there could have been a feeling of vengefulness , but no one acted on it . And I don't know why you sometimes hear accusations to the effect that the Armenians are guilty , that it is they who organized it . Rumors like that are being spread in Azerbaijan . And if one old person says it and ten young ones hear it , they not only perceive it with their minds , but with their hearts , too . To them it seems that the older person is telling the truth . For example , one says ; `` Did you know that out of 31 people killed ( by the way , originally they said 31 people , but later they found a 32nd ) , 30 were Azerbaijani and one was an Armenian ? '' Of course I 'm upset , but it 's utterly impossible to discuss such things and not become upset . Sometimes l forget things , but I know I want to return to the time when we were in the SK club across from the City Party Committee . When I saw Muslimzade in the SK club building I went to him to ask because I could n't believe that he had marched in the front carrying a banner . I already mentioned this , and if I repeat anything , please excuse me . I asked him , `` Why did you do that and why are you here now , why did you come here ? To laugh at these women who are strewn about on the floor ? '' The overcrowding there was tremendous , it was completely unsanitary , and several of the children were already sick . It 's true the troops tried to make it livable for us . They cooked for us on their field stoves and provided us with wonderful food , but the thing is that their main job was to ferret out the gang that was still at it everywhere , that was continuing its sordid affairs everywhere . Plus they were never given any direct orders , they did n't know what they were authorized to do and not to do . And it was only on March 8 at five o'clock in the evening that Krayev himself , the Lieutenant General , the City Commandant of Sumgait , was given full authority and told everyone over a microphone from an armored personnel carrier that now he could do what he wanted to do , as his heart advised him , and relocate people to the military unit . But that 's not what I want to talk about now . Muslimzade , characteristically , tried to get me out of the SK building and take me to the City Party Committee , which is across the square from the club . He took me by the hand and said , `` Citizen , do n't worry , we 'll go and have a talk in my office . I told him , `` No , after everything you 've done , I do n't believe one iota of what you say . If I go to the City Party Committee I 'll disappear , and the traces of me will disappear too . Because you ca n't stand it when . . . `` Oh yes , and there was another interesting detail from that meeting . It was even very funny , although at the time I was n't up to laughing . He was in a nice , expensive hat , and so as to put him to shame , so to speak , I said , `` Oh , why did you come here all duded up like a London dandy , you smell of good perfume , you 're in your starched shirt , and you have your expensive hat on . You came to ridicule the poor women and children who are lying on the floor , who are already getting sick , whose relatives have died . Did you come to laugh at them ? '' And the one who was accompanying him , an Azerbaijani , I do n't know who he was or what his title was , he quickly snatched the hat off Muslimzade 's head and hid it . Then I said , `` My God ! We 're not marauders . We 're not you ! We did n't come to you with the intention of stealing ! '' `` Well kill me , kill me ! '' Muslimzade says to me , `` But I 'm not guilty . . . kill me , kill me , but I 'm not guilty . '' And I say , `` OK , fine , you 're not guilty , have it your way . But give us an answer , we 're asking you : Where were you when they were torturing and raping those poor women , when they were killing the children , burning things , carrying on outrageously , and wrecking all those apartments ? Where were you then ? '' `` You know , we did n't expect it , we did not know what to do , we did n't anticipate that something like that would happen in Sumgait . '' I started laughing and said , `` It 's truly funny . '' He says , `` What could I do ? We did n't know what to do . '' And I say , `` I 'm sorry , but it 'll be ridiculous if I tell you : The First Secretary of the City Party Committee should n't march out in front with a banner ; he should fall down so that the gang would have to cross over his dead body . That 's what you should have done . That 's the way it was during the war . Not a single party committee secretary compromised himself ; either he died or he led people into battle . And what did you do ? You ran away , you left , you hid , you marched with a flag , because you were afraid , excuse my language , you feared for your own damned hide . And when we ask you , you tell us that you got confused and you ask me what you could have done ? That 's right , '' I told him , `` the City party committee got confused , all the party committees got confused , the police got confused , . Baku got confused , they all lay in a faint for two weeks , and the gang ran the show with impunity . And if it were n't for the troops it would n't have been just two days , there would n't be a single Armenian left in Sumgait for sure , they would have finished their bloody affair , because they brazenly went up to some Russians , too , the ones who tried to say something to them , and they told them , 'As soon as we finish with the Armenians we 'll come after you , too . '' And by the way , there was a colonel , who took us to the military unit . He was the one with the light blue collar tabs who flew in and two hours later arrived on an armored personnel carrier when we were at the SK and took us to the military unit and who later started moving us from the military unit . We asked him , `` What ? How ? What will come of us ? '' He openly said , `` You know , for us the main thing now is to catch that gang . We 'll finish that quickly . You'll stay at the military unit for the time being , and we 'll decide later . '' The General Procuracy of the USSR arrived , it consists of investigators from all cities . There were some from Stavropol , from everywhere , just everywhere , because the affair was truly frightful . About this , by the way , Comrade Katusev spoke ; as everyone knows , he 's the First Deputy General Procurator of the USSR . When he gave us a speech from the armored personnel carrier at the military unit , by the way , he told us the honest truth , because he could n't not say it , because he was still experiencing his first impressions of what he had seen , and he said , `` There was Afghanistan ; and it was bad , but Sumgait -- it's horrible ! And the people who dared to do such a thing will be severely punished , in accordance with our laws . '' And that 's a quote . Then one mother throws herself at him -- her two sons had died before her very eyes -- and says , '' Who will return my sons ? Who is going to punish the [ culprits ] ? '' They tried to calm her down , and he said , `` In order for us to conduct a proper investigation , in order that not a single scoundrel avoid responsibility , you must help us , because we do n't know , maybe there was someone else in the gang who is now being concealed in homes , and maybe the neighbors know , maybe someone saw something . Do n't be afraid , write about it in detail . So that you 're not afraid . . . Everyone knows that many of you are afraid , having lived through such horrors , they think that if they write the whole truth about , let 's say , their neighbor or someone else , that they will seek revenge later . We 're going to do it like this : We 're going to set up an urn and you can throw what you write in there . We do n't need to know who wrote it . The names of the people who write wo n't be made public , but we need all the information . Let each and every one not be afraid , let each write what is necessary , who they saw in that gang , who made threats or shouted threatening gibes about the Armenians . . . You must describe all of these people and put the information into the urn . '' Two soldiers and a major guarded the urn . And , sure enough , many people , people who did n't even want to write . . .I know one woman who asked me , she came up and said , `` You , as a Russian , the same thing wo n't happen to you as will happen to me . So please . . . I 'll give you the information , and you please write it down for me . '' So she was afraid , and there were a lot like her . . . But later , after Katusev made his speech , she sat and wrote down everything she knew . And we threw it all into the urn . Now we do n't know if it will be of any use . For a factual picture will emerge from all that information . One person can lie , but thousands ca n't lie , thousands simply ca n't lie . You have to agree with that , a fact is a fact . Why , for example , should someone say that black is white if it is really black ? The First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Azerbaijani SSR , Mamedov , as I said , was in Yerevan . My husband and I were at the Council of Ministers of the Armenian SSR and found out that Mamedov was present , the one who had come to convince the people of Sumgait to return to their previous dwellings , to their old apartments . We asked for a meeting with him , and it was granted . When we went to see him he tried to behave properly , very politely , delicately , but . . . when the truth was told right to his face and when I asked him some of the same questions I had asked Muslimzade , `` Where were you personally when they were beating us ? Now you 're trying to convince us to return , why did n't you think at the time that they were slaughtering us where it was all leading ? '' he says , `` You 're telling the truth . Let 's not mince words . You 've told me right to my face , and I 'll tell you straight . I 'll tell you the pure truth . I was gotten out of bed in the evening , the whole government was up , including me , and we were restraining a crowd of about 45,000 in Baku . But we never expected that in a city like Sumgait , with its fine international record , such a thing could happen . We expected it in Baku . '' I say , `` So that means you expected it all the same ? Why were you expecting it ? '' And he says , `` You know , it just happened that way . We were expecting it in Baku , we were trying to restrain it , but in Sumgait . . . `` I say , `` Fine , you did n't know for the first three or four hours , but then you should have known . Why did no one help us ? '' And he says , `` Well , OK , we did n't know what to do '' and things like that . Basically it was the same story I got from Muslimzade . Later , when he said , `` You go on back , the situation in Sumgait is favorable now , everything is fine , the Armenians are friendly with the Azerbaijanis . . . `` To this l answered , `` You know what . . . I 'm speaking with you as a [ member of a ] neutral nation . . . I have never argued with Armenians or with Azerbaijanis and I was an eyewitness . . . You tell me , please , Comrade Mamedov , `` I asked him , `` What would you say about this honestly , if you were being completely frank with us ? '' Then he said , `` Yes , I admit that I am honestly ashamed , shame on the entire Azerbaijani nation , we have disgraced ourselves not only before the entire Soviet Union , but before the whole world . Because now the Voice of America and all the other foreign radio stations of various hues are branding us with all kinds of rumors , too . '' And I say , `` There 's nothing to add to what really happened . I do n't think it's possible to add anything more awful . '' He says , `` Yes , I agree with you , I understand your pain , it is truly an unfortunate occurrence . '' I repeat that he said `` unfortunate occurrence . '' And then he suddenly remembered himself , what he was saying -- he had a pen in his hands , he was fidgeting with it nervously -- and said , `` Oh , excuse me , a tragedy , really . . . `` I take this to mean that he really thinks it 's an `` unfortunate occurrence . '' `` And of course , '' he says , '' I understand that having gone through all this you ca n't return to Sumgait , but it 's necessary to cool down and realize that all those people are being tried . '' And he even gave a detail , which , I do n't know if it matters or not , that 160 policemen were being tried . Specifically in relation to that bloody affair . Yes , by the way , there is another good detail , how I was set up at work in Baku after the events . I went to an undergarment plant , there was an Azerbaijani working there , and suddenly she tells me , `` What , they didn't nail your husband ? They screwed up . '' I was floored , I had n't imagined that anyone in Baku , too , could say something like that . Well after that I went up to see . . . to my office , I needed to find out about those days , what was going to happen with them , how they were going to put down those days from February 29 to March 10 . . . and the administrator told me , `` I do n't know , Tatyana , go to the head of the conductors ' pool . Be grateful if they do n't put it down as unexcused absence . '' I was really discouraged by this . They all know that we were but a hair away from death and barely survived , and here they 're telling me that I was skipping work , as though I was off enjoying myself somewhere . I went to the office of the chief of the pool , his last name is Rasulov , and he 's had that position for many years . Incidentally , he 's a Party member , and is a big man in town . And suddenly , when I went to him and said , `` Comrade Rasulov , this is the way it was . . . `` He looked at me askance and said , `` And why are you '' -- he knows me by my previous last name -- '' why did you get wrapped up in this mess ? '' I say , `` What do you mean , why did I get wrapped up in this mess ? My husband 's an Armenian , '' I tell him , `` I have an Armenian last name . '' And he screwed up his face , made a kind of a grimace , as though he had eaten something sour , and said , `` I did n't expect that you would . . . `` What did he mean by that ? And `` how '' should he behave , the chief of the pool , a man who supervises 1,700 workers ? Now , it 's true , there was a reduction , but for sure there are still 1,200 conductors working for him . And if someone who supervises a staff that size says things like that , then what can you expect from a simple , uneducated , politically unsophisticated person ? ! He 's going to believe any and all rumors , that the Armenians are like this , the Armenians are like that , and so on . . . By the way , that Mamedov -- now I 'm going back to Mamedov 's office when I asked him `` Are you really going to guarantee the safety of our lives if we return to Sumgait ? '' he answered , `` Yes , you know , I would guarantee them . . . I don't want to take on too much , I would guarantee them firmly for 50 years . But I wo n't guarantee them for longer than 50 years . '' I say , `` So you 've got another thing like that planned for 50 years from now ? So they 'll be quiet and then in another 50 years it 'll happen again ? ! '' I could n't contain myself any more , and I also told him , `` And how did it get to that point , certainly you knew about it , how they were treating the Russians , for example , in Baku and in Sumgait , how they were hounded from their jobs ? Certainly you received complaints , I wrote some myself . Why did no one respond to them ? Why did everyone ignore what was going on ? Did n't you prepare people for this by the way you treated them ? '' And he says , `` You know , you 're finally starting to insult me ! '' He threw his pen on the desk . `` Maybe now you 'll say I 'm a scoundrel too ? '' I say , `` You know , I 'm not talking about you because I do n't know . But about the ones who I do know I can say with conviction , yes , that comrade was involved in this , that , and that , because I know for certain . `` Well anyway he assured us that here , in Yerevan , there were false rumors , that 3,000 Sumgait Armenians were here , and 15,000 were in Sumgait and had gotten back to work . Everyone was working , he said , and life was very good . `` We drove about the town ourselves , Comrade Arutiunian [ First Secretary of the Communist Party of Armenia SSR ] came from the Council of Ministers of Armenian , he came and brought information showing that everything was fine in Sumgait . '' When I asked Mamedov how he had reached that conclusion he said , ' '' Well , I walked down the street . '' And I said , `` Walking down the street in any city , even if I were to go to New York , I would never understand the situation because I would be a guest , I do n't have any contact with people , but if you spend 10 days among some blue-collar workers in such a way that they did n't know you were the First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers , you 'd hear something quite different . '' I told him , for example , that I drew my conclusion when we left the military unit to look at our apartments . They took us all in turns to pick things up , since people had fled to the military unit ; they got on the bus just to save themselves as soon as possible . How are the neighbors in the microdistrict , how will they view us , what do they think ? I thought maybe that in fact it was n't something general , of a mass nature , some anti-national something . And when that bus took us to our building , because it was the same bus , while we were going up to our apartment , an armed soldier accompanied us . What does that say ? It speaks of the fact that if everything there were fine , why do we need to have soldiers go there and come back with us , going from apartment to apartment ? And in fact , especially with the young people , you could sense the delight at our misfortune , the grins , and they were making comments , too . And that was in the presence of troops , when police detachments were in the microdistricts and armored personnel carriers and tanks were passing by . And if people are taking such malicious delight when the situation is like that , then what is it going to be like when they withdraw protection from the city altogether ? There will be more outrages , of course , perhaps not organized , but in the alleys . . .

From : ejbehr @ rs6000.cmp.ilstu.edu ( Eric Behr ) Subject : Asante EN/SC hangs SCSI devices Reply-To : behr @ math.ilstu.edu ( Eric Behr ) Organization : Central Illinois Surfing Club Lines : 31 I just hooked up my Mac IIsi to a relatively old ( 1 year ? ) Asante EN/SC adapter . The 10Base-T connection works like a charm . I installed the newest drivers from Asante 's ftp server . The problem begins when I attach one more device to the SCSI chain - specifically a 50MB drive . I power up the drive , then the Mac . The Mac tests memory , etc . Just before the `` happy Mac face '' normally shows up , the power light on the EN/SC goes out , and the boot process stops . So I can use the network , or the external drive , but not both at once . This makes the Asante box pretty much unusable . It does n't look like a purely electrical SCSI problem , because if I turn on the drive just a second or so too late , so that it does n't get noticed during the initial SCSI polling , the Mac boots normally and the adapter works , even though the hard disk is powered on and connected . The Mac has *never* once failed to boot from its internal drive up to now ( and I 've had it for over a year ) . Here is what I tried : changing the SCSI ID 's of the EN/SC and the disk -- several permutations ; changing the order of devices , i.e . the EN/SC at the head or tail of the chain ; overterminating with an external terminator ( both devices have internal ones ) ; underterminating , i.e . removing internal resistors from the hard disk ; trying another EN/SC box ; trying another identical drive ; trying several different SCSI cables . Has anybody seen this ? More importantly , does anyone have a solution ? Thanks a lot .

In most cases , the owners have very little to do with it . They give their general managers one order when it comes to the draft ... find me the best players so that our team will win the Stanley Cup . Whether that player is in Kindersley , Saskatchewan or Chelyabinsk , Russia , if the GM believes him to be the better player , the GM should be drafting him . Where do you get off calling the NHL THEIR league , when referring to Canadian players . It does n't belong to them , it belongs to the owners . The owners can do what they want . While a 'Canadian content ' rule might be enforcable here in Canada , there is enough doubt that it would be enforcable in the US that the CFL ( sorry for the football reference ) did n't even TRY to push their import ratio rule on the Sacromento Goldminers . Increasing the competition for the 'elite ' positions , in most cases , would make players better anyways . ( Oh yeah , and how many Europeans play at the lower levels of professional hockey in North America ? While there are some that play in the AHL , or the IHL where that 's an NHL team 's primary farm club , you do n't hear of many Europeans playing in the CHL , the ECHL , or on the secondary farm teams in the IHL . ( ie . the Jets do have a few Russian players in Moncton , but I do n't believe there are any Europeans in Ft . Wayne . ) ) So with all those teams , there are plenty of positions for hockey players in North America . > > With the numbers of Euros in the NHL escalating , the problem is clearly > only getting worse . > > I 'm all for the creation of a European Hockey League , and let the Bures > and Selannes of the world play on their own continent . > > I just do n't want them on mine .

The Centaur that is being built for T4 would be a better bet to integrate onto the Proton as the T4/Centaur is designed for the Extremely Harsh envorinment of the T4 launch . It is also closer to 4 m in diameter . You 've hit on the real kicker , however . The Centaur is pressure stabilized . It can not hold up its own weight without pressure in the tanks . Additionally , the pressure difference between the two tanks must be maintained to ~+/- 5 psi . That is rather tight to be rocking and rolling on the train . The pressure stabilization is how centaur achieves the performance . On numerous occasions ( when I was there 88-91 ) the AF wanted to see what it would take to make a non-pressure stabilized centaur . The answer -- a centaur not worth launching . The Atlas/Centaur does not require on-pad integration , however the T4/Centaur does . I believe the on-pad integration is to a great extent due to the cleanliness requirements and PFL configuration , so maybe something can be done there ... ... .. | > | > They would also need LOX and LH facilities added to the Proton pads | > ( unless the new Proton second stage is actually built ) , and of course | > any Centaur support systems and facilities , no doubt imported from the | > US at great cost .

The addition of LOX/LH facilities is critical as the centaur tops off as it lifts off . A LHe facility is also needed . I do n't know what the proton uses for fuel , but since they are derived from ICBM 's I would suspect that they use storable propellants which do n't have the ullage problem that cryo 's do . If there is no cryo at the sight at all , the addition of these systems could be big $ $ , not to mention the real tech transfer issues involved with providing centaur GSE to Russia . That issue alone might be enough to kill this idea . -- H.D .

Labs Lines : 50 I am working on a project to provide an emergency management information system . In keeping with more classic command and control type systems , we are considering developing a dual screen monitor system in order to provide a status board on it 's own monitor . I have a number of X level questions regarding this : ( We are devloping on Unix systems using X/Motif . Platform will be predominantly Sun 's , probably with ports to RS/6000 as well ) . I am assuming the standard dual monitor systems are configured such that we are talking about one X display and multiple screens , and not multiple X displays . Given this : - Is changing input focus from one screen to the other as simple as tracking your mouse from one screen to the other ? There's nothing special that needs to be done to shift focus between screens ? - Do I have to run separate window managers on the separate screens or are there multiscreen window managers out there ? What are they ; who sells them ... - Is a multi-screen window manager the only way I can grab a window frame and move a window from one screen to the next ? - Is there any way for the application to transparently see multiple screens as one logical x-y plane , or does the hardware only provide for each screen to start at 0,0 ? - Any thoughts on the difficulties involved with designing a system capable of using either multiple screens or a single screen ( perhaps running a virtual window manager to simulate multiple screens instead ) ? I am assuming that this is not a major issue - that I can rely on providing config files which will specify for each configuration the screen placement of each window in the application .

The most recent expansion drafts allowed teams to protect two goalies and did not make a distinction between forwards and defensemen . First-year pros only will be exempt from the draft , which is down from the two-year exemption teams had last season . San Jose , Tampa Bay and Ottawa still will be allowed to exempt second-year pros . Each of the 24 teams will lose two players , with a maximum loss of one goaltender and a maximum loss of one defenseman . The one exception is that a team which loses a goaltender can then no longer lose a defenseman . At the end of the first phase of the draft , the two new franchises will have three goaltenders , eight defensemen and 13 forwards for a total of 24 players . A second phase then will be conducted where San Jose , Tampa Bay and Ottawa will select two players each from the rosters of the two new teams . Ottawa , Tampa Bay and San Jose will be guaranteed priority drafting selection in the 1993 draft as long as they have the three worst records .

The expansion franchises will move up in the draft should either San Jose , Tampa Bay or Ottawa not finish in the bottom three positions . The two new teams will pick first and second in the 1994 Entry Draft , regardless of their finish in 1993-94 . Should either of the two new teams not play next season they would have priority drafting position in 1994 . The owners announced the 1994 draft will be in Hartford and the 1995 draft in Winnipeg . The 1994 draft was scheduled for Boston , but a delay in the construction of a new arena required the draft be moved . -- -- - - League news : Disputes : The NHL owners and players have resolved differences over salary arbitration procedures , clearing the way for about 40 hearings .

Meanwhile , San Antonio and Houston are close to being confirmed as the league 's newest members . -- -- - - Major League Hockey A new hockey league with franchises throughout the United States and Canada will begin play in the fallof 1993 , officials announced Wednesday , February 10 . Major League Hockey was founded by Roy Boe , former president of the New York Islanders of the National Hockey League and the New York/New Jersey Nets of the American and National Basketball associations . According to Boe , the league will debut with six to eight teams playing a schedule of approximately 80 games . Franchise applications have been received from groups in Chicago , Cleveland , Dallas , Denver , Detroit , Houston , Minneapolis-St. Paul , Phoenix , San Francisco , Saskatoon , Toronto and Worcester , Mass. , Boe said . Although the league will not raid existing leagues to stock its rosters , Boe said it will seek the `` world 's finest hockey players . '' Boe said league play will have an international flair and discussed implementing some rules which are reminiscent of those of the IIHF . `` We 're removing the red line , moving the goal nets forward and eliminating all tie games , '' said Boe . The MLH office will operate out of Stamford , Conn. -- -- - - British Premier Division : contacts : Neil A.

Answers to some frequently asked questions : Q : Why are the Montreal Canadiens called the Habs ? A : Most of the team during the 40-50 's was made up of people who lived in and around Montreal . Hence they were called `` Les Habitants '' ( natives of Montreal ) . This was then shortened to the Habs . Q : Why is the Montreal Canadiens logo a large C with an H within it ? A : In 1914-15 , the Canadiens logo consisted of C with an A within it to signify Club Athletique Canadien ( CAC ) . The next year , CAC no longer existed and it was changed to what it is now to signify Club de Hockey . Q : What is the most informative hockey publication ? A : The Hockey News is preferred by most North American hockey fans . It is a weekly journal with up-to-date info . Phone : 800-268-7793 ( Canada and US ) Phone/fax : 0483 776141 ( UK and rest of Europe ) Q : How does a 5-minute power-play count in the penalty killing stats in the NHL ? A : If X goals are scored , then the team gets credit for X goals in X+1 chances . Q : How is +/- computed in the NHL ? A : First , +/- only applies to skaters . Except for a power-play goal , when a goal is scored , each skater on the ice for the scoring team is given a + , and each skater on the ice for the other team is given a - . Short- handed goals do count for +/- . Q : What is the five-hole ? A : The space between a goalie 's pads . There are five major scoring zones : ( 1 ) upper left corner of goal , ( 2 ) upper right , ( 3 ) lower left , ( 4 ) lower right , and ( 5 ) five-hole . Q : What is the meaning of throwing an octopus on the ice ? A : This tradition began in Detroit in the 1950 's when two best-of-seven series were required to win the Stanley Cup . Every time Detroit won a game , an octopus with one less arm was thrown on the ice . Q : Who was the first woman to play in an NHL game ? A : Manon Rheaume , a 20-year-old goaltender , became the first woman ever to play in an NHL game on September 23 , 1992 when she started in net for the expansion Tampa Bay Lightning in an exhibition against the St. Louis Blues . Rheaume played the first period before 8,223 at the 10,400-seat Expo Hall on the Florida State Fairgrounds and allowed two goals on nine shots . She left with the score tied 2-2 , although the Lightning ultimately lost the game , 6-4 . Q : What is the richest contract in NHL history ? A : Mario Lemieux , the superstar center of the Pittsburgh Penguins , signed the richest contract in NHL history , a seven-year deal believed to be worth about $ 42 million . Lemieux will earn between $ 6 million and $ 7 million a year , nearly twice as much as any other player in the league . Q : Who is the new commissioner of the NHL ? A : Gary Bettman , vice president and general counsel of the National Basketball Association , was named commissioner of the National Hockey League , Friday , December 11 , 1992 . Bettman joined the NBA in 1981 as assistant general counsel . He became the league 's chief legal officer in September of 1984 . A New York resident , Bettman graduated from Cornell University in 1974 and from New York University School of Law in 1977 . Q : How many professional hockey leagues are there in North America ? A : Six : National , American , International , East Coast , Central and Colonial Hockey Leagues . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 9 .

Originator : kayman @ csd-d-3.Stanford.EDU Keywords : printer Organization : Computer Science Department , Stanford University Lines : 35 Hello fellow 'netters . I am asking for your collected wisdom to help me decide which printer I should purchase , the Canon BJ200 ( BubbleJet ) vs. the HP DeskJet 500 . I thought , rather than trust the salesperson , I would benefit more from relying on those who use these printers daily and use them to their fullest potential . And , I figure all of you will know their benefits and pitfalls better than any salesperson . Now , I would greatly appreciate any information you could render on the 360 dpi of the Canon BubbleJet vs. the Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 500 ( 300 dpi ) . Which is faster ? Is there a noticeable print quality difference , particularly in graphics ? Which will handle large documents better ( 75 pages or more ) -- any personal experience on either will be appreciated here ? Which works better under Windows 3.1 ( any driver problems , etc ) ? Cost of memory , font packages , toner cartridges , etc ? Basically , your personal experiences with either of these machines is highly desirable , both good and bad . Advance kudos and thanks for all your input .

Article-I.D . : pion.Apr.6.12.05.34.1993.11732 Organization : Rutgers Univ. , New Brunswick , N.J. Lines : 26 Well , I just got my Centris 610 yesterday . It took just over two weeks from placing the order . The dealer ( Rutgers computer store ) appologized because Apple made a substitution on my order . I ordered the one without ethernet , but they substituted one _with_ ethernet . He wanted to know if that would be `` alright with me '' ! ! ! They must be backlogged on Centri w/out ethernet so they 're just shipping them with ! Anyway , I 'm very happy with the 610 with a few exceptions . Being nosy , I decided to open it up _before_ powering it on for the first time . The SCSI cable to the hard drive was only partially connected ( must have come loose in shipping ) . No big deal , but I would have been pissed if I tried to boot it and it would n't come up ! The hard drive also has an annoying high pitched whine . I've heard apple will exchange it if you complain , so I might try to get it swapped . I am also dissappionted by the lack of soft power-on/off . This was n't mentioned in any of the literature I saw . Also , the location of the reset/interupt buttons is awful . Having keyboard control for these functions was much more convenient . Oh , and the screen seems tojump in a wierd way on power-up . I 've seen this mentioned by others , so it must be a ... feature ... Anyway , above all , it 's fast .

I have no first hand experience with her ability as an umpire . But I have seen her on talk shows . And her point seems to be that she can call balls and strikes as well as any of the umpires and she knows the rulebook better than most . It seems to me that she is missing the point and if that 's how she sees the role of umpires in the game , well I would n't promote her either . The umpires primary role has nothing to do with calling baserunners safe or out ; hell , Joe Lundy could do that . Their primary function is to maintain order in the game , keep the game moving , and keep the players from trying to kill each other . Umpires have to be extremely tough people . That disqualifies most of us , both men and women . And if Ms. Postema thinks that she deserves to be a major league umpire because of her command of the rulebook , then I think that disqualifies her as well . Umpires need to command the game ; command of the rulebook is secondary . -- Dave Eisen `` To succeed in the world , it is not dkeisen @ leland.Stanford.EDU enough to be stupid , you must also Sequoia Peripherals : ( 415 ) 967-5644 be well-mannered .

( I do n't remember a 30-day , but rather a 21-day . Anyways , it 's gone now . ) The period length is a minimum , not a maximum . You can keep a guy on the 15-day for as long as you want , IF he 's still certified as injured . The player must be periodically re-evaluated to determine if he 's still injured ( thus you can not park a player on the DL who maybe is out of options and you do not wish to expose to waivers ) . If you get someone qualified for the 60-day that reduces the frequency of re-evaluations . There is no longer , I believe , any limit to the number of players you can place on the DL .

And , yes , it 's pretty easy to argue that Smith , . Yount , Evans , Winfield , etc . are in the top 1 % . Dave Kingman on the other hand , was a liability throughout most of his career . Of course , Garvey *hasn't* gotten a lot of HOF press , so I do n't know what you mean . As for Ryan , is his W-L better than Morris ' ? That 's what a lot of voters tend to look at .

From : Clinton-HQ @ Campaign92.Org ( Clinton/Gore '92 ) Subject : CLINTON : Press Briefing by George Stephanopoulos 4.14.93 Organization : MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab Lines : 996 NNTP-Posting-Host : life.ai.mit.edu THE WHITE HOUSE Office of the Press Secretary _____________________________________________________________________ For Immediate Release April 14 , 1993 PRESS BRIEFING BY GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS The Briefing Room 12:40 P.M. EDT MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I guess I 'm just prepared to take questions today . Q George , Bob Dole says that the Clinton administration 's policy on Bosnia is a failure and that he wants the United States to take the lead in lifting the arms embargo so that the Bosnian Muslims can defend themselves . MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : As you know , President Clinton has said that that suggestion is under active consideration . Obviously , this is a tragic situation in Bosnia . And if the Bosnian Serbs do n't come to the negotiating table in a constructive way , we 'll look seriously at pressing for lifting the arms embargo . In the meantime , we 're going to continue to press for a tough sanctions resolution in the U.N. We 're going to continue to work on the Serbs to come to the negotiating table . But the prospect of an arms embargo is something the President certainly will consider if the Serbs do n't come to the table . Q How much longer are you going to give them to come to the table , George ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : We 're working on that right now . Q It 's been a long time . Q On February 19th , the President mentioned the value added tax in Ohio . And when he was asked about it later by reporters , he said -- quote -- `` That is a radical change in the tax system of the United States . It 's something I think we may have to look at in the years ahead . '' Questioned again about it later he says , `` It is not something that is now under consideration . If we start considering it , I 'll tell you . '' It was n't a trial balloon or anything , he said . I was just discussing the tax response to a question . Donna Shalala , quoted in USA Today this morning -- quote - - `` Certainly we 're looking at a VAT . '' What 's gone on ? Q The same with Alice Rivlin this morning . MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : The health care task force is reviewing a number of options . They have n't made any decisions yet . And as I have said from this podium time and time again , we 're not going to comment on decisions that have n't been made . Q But you have also said from this podium time and time again -- Q Wait a minute . Whoa , Nelly . Whoa . Q that that was not under consideration . Q Yes . Clinton says , `` It is not something that is now under consideration . '' Is that no longer true ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I believe the working group , as Ms. Shalala says , has looked at this prospect , but no decisions have been made of any kind . Q Well , I know . But he said he 'd tell us about it if it was ever under consideration . I take it that now he is and he did n't tell us about it or -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Did he say if it was under consideration or if it was something to be proposed ? Q `` If we start considering I 'll tell you . '' MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : If it 's something to be proposed ? Q `` If we start considering it , I 'll tell you . '' That 's a direct quote . MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : The task force has looked at a number of different options . They have not made any decisions yet . The President has not made any decisions yet . This is -- one of the proposals under consideration by the task force was to go out and cast as wide a net as possible for different ideas on how to reform the health care system . They have cast a very wide net . They have looked at hundreds of different proposals -- probably thousands of different proposals . But the President has not made any decisions . Q Well , is the President aware of their consideration of this option ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I do n't know if he 's been briefed on any preliminary conclusions or anything like that from the task force on this specific proposal of any kind . I do n't know that that 's gotten to his level . He started yesterday to go through with the task force a very wide range of decisions and I do n't believe that that 's been presented to him , no . Q Well , he 's not relying on the USA Today to tell him what his task force is considering in the way of taxes . MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : No , he 's going through it in a very deliberate fashion . There are a number of decisions that have to be made . I do n't know that this proposal has reached that decision- making point . Q If this is still under consideration , that 's a change , at least from what we 've been told by Dee Dee , I think about three weeks ago or so . She said , that is not an option , talking about the -- had a big argument with somebody over this , so I remember it specifically -- and said it not once , but twice . Is that not the case ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Again , I do n't know if this has been presented to the President as something that is being looked at at some level in the task force . Q It was ruled it out , though . I mean , unlike other options that you 've kept in the mix , this one specifically was ruled out . MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Again , this is something that is being looked at , but no decision has been made of any kind . I mean , it does n't -- it 's not necessarily material until you get to the decision-making phase . The working groups are looking at hundreds of different options . Q If it was ruled out before and it 's not ruled out now , then something has changed , George . Yes , no ? Q When a guy says in February -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Well , the working groups are looking at the widest possible range of options . Q So something 's changed . They were n't looking at it before ; they 're looking at it now . MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Well , I do n't know if the working groups have gotten to that point yet . They are casting a very wide net . Q How was it possible that you and Dee Dee were able to sell -- definitively rule it out as an option previously and now are saying that , in fact , it is being considered ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Again , the working groups are looking at a wide range of options . They have not -- Q Do you deny that you and Dee Dee ruled it -- flatly ruled it out on several occasions in the past month ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I do n't deny that -- I mean , those are the President 's words . Those are very clear . Q Subsequent to the President 's words , do you deny that within the last month you and Dee Dee have both publicly ruled it out ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I do n't know about the timing . I think what we did was refer back to the President 's words and say they stand . Q So do n't they stand any longer ? Q March 25th , Clinton said for the next four to five years it was ruled out . MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Well , those words -- the President did say that in February . The working groups are on a separate track , and as I said , I do n't believe -- Q Separate from the President ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I do n't believe this has been presented to the President . Q Are they considering something that the President -- Q Has ruled out ? Q has ruled out ? I mean , will the President consider a VAT tax ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Again , the working groups have not presented this to the President . They have looked at a wide range of options . I suppose that if an argument is made , he will clearly listen to it . That does not mean he has decided to do it . Q Can we put this another way ? In his answer in Ohio , he looked at the VAT in terms of restructuring the whole tax system . Under those -- that was the circumstance that he said it might be considered at some future point . Is that no longer the case , or is that the only way that he can see a VAT emerging ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I guess I 'm not sure exactly what you 're asking . Q He talked about the VAT in the context of a restructured tax system , not as a specific way to finance health care , for example . Q Or anything else . Q Or anything else . Q It was always in the context of substituting for other taxes at a time of a dramatic overhaul of the whole tax system . MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Right . Q Has that change , too ? Q Is that still his view ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I have n't spoken about those specific comments . I think -- I can just go back to it -- are the working groups -- have they examined the possibility of a VAT ? Yes , they have . Q Certainly we 're looking at a VAT , she said . MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : They have examined the possibility of a VAT . Has it been presented to the President ? Has he made a decision ? No , he has not . Q What kind of a deal do you have when you 've got the President 's appointed task force , obviously not oblivious to his ruling something out except in the context of some huge down the line reform , goes ahead on its own and considers a tax which he has specifically ruled out in any context other than much later , and then goes ahead and announces that that 's what they 're looking at ? Is the President concerned about that sort of thing ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I think that the President 's concern is to make sure he gets the best health care proposal possible . He 's concerned with making sure that they have the most thorough process for examining all the possible alternatives , all the different alternatives . If a decision is made to go forward with something like that it 's certainly something the President will explain and justify . But no decision has been made along those lines . Q What does it mean exactly , though , when the President rules something out ? Does it mean it can get back on the table later if a more persuasive argument is made ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : That 's just -- that 's indisputably true . If you -- but , at the same time , he has not ruled it in . He has not made a proposal . Q What makes him open to it now when he was n't open to it before ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : He 's certainly willing to listen to the argument . Q Was he willing to listen to the argument for a short-term tax this year , and he was n't willing to listen to it in Chilicothe ? He 's now open to it -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : The context of his comments was that it was not something -- he wanted to be clear that this is not something he was proposing , not something he was floating . Q Not something he was considering . Those are his words -- `` It 's not something that 's now under consideration . If we start considering it , I 'll tell you . '' You 're now acknowledging , are you not , that it is under consideration and -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I 'm acknowledging that the task force has studied this proposal . I am also stating that the President has not made a decision on it . Q But the door is open for the President to reconsider including this as part of -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Obviously , the working groups are looking at it . Again , but the President has not made a decision . Q Do you know if they will make a presentation on behalf of the VAT to him ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I do n't know that . I assume that if -- I do n't know what stage they are it in proposing . I do n't know that they 're going to make the conclusion that this is something they should present to him . I know this is something the working groups are looking at . Q Do you understand , George , that none of us are asking these questions in context of a decision that the President has made , only about what the President is considering ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I understand that , and I am acknowledging that the working groups have examined the issue of a VAT . Q And the President will consider it ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I assume that he will consider the argument if it is presented to him . Q Does that mean the President -- that working groups think that when the President says no , he means maybe ? ( Laughter . ) MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I think that means that the working groups are trying to do the most thorough job possible . Q George , can I ask you another question about Bosnia ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Sure . ( Laughter . ) Q No , he wants us to stay on this . Q Let 's do gays in the military . ( Laughter . ) Q No , he got out of that swamp . Q I think we 've gotten the bottom line on that VAT . Reggie Bartholomew , your Special Ambassador in Belgrade , today said that if the Serbs do not accept the agreement that has been worked out -- quote -- `` We will do our part to pursue the lifting of the arms embargo together with our allies . '' That seems to go a bit further than what you 've just said -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Sounds almost exactly what I just said . Q Well , do you accept -- in other words , you accept what Reggie -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Well , the President has said that this is something that 's under consideration . It is something he will consider if the current actions do n't bring the Serbs to the table . Q Is n't there some kind of timetable here ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Yes , there is a timetable . There 's going to be a vote on the U.N. resolution in about 10 days . Q That 's on sanctions , that 's on tightening the sanctions . MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : That 's right , that 's sanctions . And we believe that that will ratchet up the pressure , and we hope that that will bring the Serbs to the table . As you know , Mr. Bartholomew also met with Mr. Churkin of Russia , and they are also working on ways to bring the Serbs to the table . We will continue to pressure them in many different ways and this is one possible option as well . Q The question is whether there 's a timetable for consideration or a vote on a decision on lifting the arms embargo , not the sanctions . MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : The next vote in the U.N. is on sanctions . As far as I know , there are no votes scheduled on lifting the arms embargo . But it is something that we have discussed both internally and with our allies . Q Why did Reggie Bartholomew tell the Serbs that the U.S. would do that ? What was the point of his telling them that ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Well , clearly , I mean , this is something that 's under consideration , and this is something that we take quite seriously if they do not come to the table . They should know the consequences of failing to come to the table . Q Have they been given a deadline ? Q Warren Christopher has been saying the same thing and it has n't seemed to change the Serbs ' behavior in the least . Why should the Serbs take any heed of a threat to lift the arms embargo when so far everything that 's been done has had no effect on the fighting in Bosnia ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I just do n't accept the premise of your question . It has had an effect ; the embargo is having an effect . Q What effect ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : If the Serbians choose not to heed our warnings , then they will face the consequences . Q What effect has it had in Bosnia ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Well , the effect that it has had on the Serbians , it has tightened up -- they are not getting their shipments through . We can brief more fully -- Q In Bosnia , George . In Bosnia what effect has it had ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Well , it 's hard to say if it 's stopped the aggression to date . That is why we 're continuing to press for the Serbians to stop . But we believe that over time we will continue to weaken the Serbs and that will have an effect . I 'm not saying it 's going to happen overnight ; it clearly has n't happened overnight . But we believe that over time the sanctions can weaken the Serbs . If it fails to work and if the Serbs fail to come to the negotiating table , we 'll move forward with the embargo . Q Is n't there a working deadline , George , of the 24th -- the same date as the U.N. -- the scheduled U.N. vote ? Has n't the United States said , along with many of the other NATO allies , that if the Serbs are n't willing to sign on to the peace accord by then , that we 'll seek -- have n't we said that we will seek -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : We 've said continually we 're going to -- Q But on that deadline ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I do n't have a specific date , but we 're going to move forward with the resolution , the U.N. resolution , by around that time . And if that fails to take effect , if that fails to bring the Serbs to the table , we will clearly consider other actions . Q Is n't this awfully incremental ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : We 're taking a step-by-step approach . We 're ratcheting up the pressure and we 're going to continue to do that . Q Is there a possibility , George , that by the time all these incremental steps are taken the Serbs will have achieved their goals and then what 's the purpose ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I think the purpose is to get the Serbs to stop the aggression . We are pursuing that goal on many different fronts . We are pursuing it through the U.N. ; we 're pursuing it through direct talks ; we are pursuing it through tightening the sanctions . And we will consider lifting the arms embargo . We are turning the screws up on the Serbs and we will continue to do that . Q But if the efforts have been unsuccessful in getting the Serbs to stop the aggression how effective will any campaign be to have the Serbs give back what they 've gained ? I mean , once they 're entrenched -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I ca n't speculate on that . We 're going to continue to press for them to come to the table now . We 're going to continue to find ways to stop the aggression . But I ca n't see into the future . Q George , on the stimulus package , House Republicans say they 're going to hold a series of town meetings on Saturday to try and explain the details of your package . They cite polls which show that the more people learn about it , the less they like it . What 's your strategy to counter that ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : The strategy we have is the one we 're going to continue . As you saw , the President today pointed up the very real benefits of the summer jobs program that this package will provide : 700,000 new summer jobs this summer for kids in inner cities and suburbs to do productive work . We are also going to point out the benefits of the highway money , the investments in highways . We 're going to point up the benefits of immunization . We 're going to point up the benefits of Head Start . We are going to say that the Republicans have a choice : they can take action to create jobs or they can perpetuate the gridlock of the last four years . Q Does it concern you , though , that the House now , the House Republicans are after you as well as the Senate ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : The House Republicans voted against it before . They made a mistake then ; they 're making a mistake now . Q George , does it strike anybody in the administration that it 's a bit strong to describe , as the President did this morning , the summer jobs program as -- quote -- `` a reaffirmation of a promise of America '' ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Not at all . I think it 's the promise of America to give kids a chance to reach their full potential . Q Government-funded jobs ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : To give people a chance to work ? Absolutely . That is the promise of America . Q I want to follow up on something I asked yesterday -- where does 700,000 summer jobs , where does that figure come from ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : That is on top of . I did look at it . There are currently 600,000 summer jobs in the pipeline . This will be on top of the 600,000 , so it will be a total of 1.3 million . Q The 700,000 would be created by the stimulus package ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Yes . Q Where does that number come from ? Because we 've been told all along that the stimulus package would create 500,000 new jobs . And according to Panetta , that breaks down to something like 200,000 full-time jobs and 150,000 summer jobs . MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Yes , but the summer -- that 's when you do their full-time equivalence . I mean , 700,000 individuals will receive jobs this summer . When you calculate it for the full-time job effect , you have to do -- I do n't know what the exact formula is . Q Seven hundred thousand part-time jobs -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : -- 150,000 or -- Q One to four because it 's three months . MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Thank you . Q Can I follow up on that ? Did the President misspeak this morning when he said that some of the government money for these summer jobs will pay for private -- for kids to work in the private sector ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Not necessarily . I mean , I think that there will be grants available . That 's one of the ways that you pay for the jobs . At the same time , he 's also issued a challenge to the private sector to hire kids on their own as well . Q Tax dollars , for instance , would pay for kids to work at Time-Warner ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I think the Time-Warner is actually somebody coming forward and actually doing a grant . That 's going to be the bulk of it . There could be isolated instances , though , where there would be grants to businesses . Q Has the President spoken with any Senate Republicans this week ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : No , but there 's been a lot of contact with Senate Republicans in the White House . Q At a lower level . But the President has n't ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : The President has not , no . Q Getting any closer to get the votes ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : We 're continuing to work on it . Q Anybody leaning your way ? Q On Haiti , The New York Times seems to be reporting something of a breakthrough in Aristide 's attitude towards the coup leaders . Can you confirm that there has been this change , and what impact will it have on the process ? And what did Pezzullo have to say yesterday in his report ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Pezzullo did brief the principals . I ca n't confirm what 's actually happening in the talks . I would leave that to the negotiators themselves . But Mr. Caputo has returned to Haiti . We have received a briefing here at the White House from Ambassador Pezzullo . And as we have said time and time again , we believe that assurances of security are important to a final resolution to a broader political settlement . Q George , yesterday you offered some selective breakdowns of how the stimulus would impact some states and cities . Can we get a complete breakdown by state of how these jobs would be impacted ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I think we have it for most states , yes . And I think we can get it out . Q Could you make that generally available ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I believe we can . Q And could you do it by the component of the stimulus ? In other words -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I do n't know if we can do -- I know that we can do it by summer jobs and other jobs . I do n't know how deeply it can be broken down . But clearly , we can break it down into summer jobs and other jobs . Q And can I follow up ? Is this the information that Jeff Eller and the rest of the White House is using in the ads in the states ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I do n't know if they 're ads , but they 're press releases . Q Can you describe what those press releases contain ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : All we 're doing is pointing out the benefits of this package to various states . For instance , I know that today Senator Dole is heading up to Vermont and New Hampshire . And I would point out that the stimulus package , the jobs package creates 1,000 jobs in Vermont . It creates 2,000 jobs in New Hampshire . And the people of those states should remind him that this is important . Q Where are the releases going ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : They go to the states . Q To whom ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : We can get them . It 's no problem . Q Can we get it ? Q Why do n't you put them out here as well ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I think we can . Q This afternoon ? Would that be possible ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I 'll have to check . I do n't know . But as soon as we can . Q Are you focusing these press releases on states where there are moderate or pragmatic Republican senators ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I think we 're trying to get as many as we can . It 's actually quite difficult to pull this together and we 're doing our best . We 're putting them out as we get them . Q Why are you so closely tracking Senator Dole 's schedule ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I was just following it . Q Are press releases going along to states where he 's visiting ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I 'm not sure . I think that probably there are press releases going to Vermont . ( Laughter . ) Q Will there be a man in a chicken suit waiting ? ( Laughter . ) Q George , as the President goes about the business of defending what 's in his stimulus package , he does n't address what seems to be the Republicans ' main point , that you 're funding it with deficit spending rather than `` if it 's so important , why not come up with the funding for it '' seems to be the Republican argument . And how do you answer that ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : What was answer is , we are paying for it over time . And if you look at our budget , we pay for this package over time . We believe right now the economy needs a jump- start for jobs . Q You 're not claiming , are you , that that does n't add to the deficit this year ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I 'm saying we 're paying for it over time . I did n't say that . Q I know that , George . But I mean , from the beginning , the question -- we do have annual budgets and things -- deficit spending will pay for that this year , will it not ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : This year they clearly will . But over time our budget fully pays for this program . Q What you 're saying is that there are savings that would cover this if it were this year in future years ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Absolutely . That 's exactly what I said . Q I know that , but there is going to be outstanding debt , it will add to the national debt from this year -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : No , we 're reducing the deficit by $ 500 billion -- $ 514 billion over the next four years . Q You mean you 're reducing it below what it would have been ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Exactly . Q In fact , you 're adding a very large amount to the national debt over the period of -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : But we 're reducing it far more from what it would have been . That 's true . Q Washington-type reduction . ( Laughter . ) Q You 're getting to be a grumpy old man . Q George , has any decision been made about the White House or the President 's participation in the gay rights march coming up in a week and a half ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : We 're working on the President 's schedule now . I believe he 's going to be at the Senate Democratic retreat in Jamestown that weekend . Q Will he address it by phone ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I do n't know about that . It 's a little far out , but I believe he 's going to be in the Senate retreat . Q So will he have the leaders in a day or two before the speech ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I do n't know . I would expect that at some point he would meet with the leaders of some of these groups . I do n't know the schedule on it , though . Q Will there be an AIDS czar appointed prior to or in conjunction with the event ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I 'm just not sure . Q April 22nd is Earth Day . What is the President going to do to mark that , and is it the case that he is going to sign the biodiversity treaty that day ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I know there 's been some work on the biodiversity treaty . I do n't know about signing it that day , but I would expect he 'll have a statement on Earth Day or right around then . Q Where is the work on the biodiversity treaty ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I 'd have to check with Katie McGinty . I just know that there 's been some work done , but I do n't know exactly what . Q When is Earth Day ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : The 22nd , I think . Q Why is it you know that he is going to have a statement on Earth Day but you do n't know if he 's going to have a statement on the gay rights march ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I said I do n't know if he 's going to meet or when he 's going to meet . Q Do you have a statement on the gay rights march ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I do n't , actually , no . I would n't be surprised if he did , though . Q Do you have some details on the Miyazawa visit ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : It 's a working visit on Friday and the President is looking forward to that in discussing a number of issues including Russian aid and the Japanese stimulus package and the trade issues between the two countries . Q There was some expectations that a second aid package to Russia was going to be unveiled at the G-7 meeting and , if I understand , it has n't happened . Why is that or what 's the status on that ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : The G-7 meeting is still going on and , as you know , Secretaries Bentsen and Christopher have talked about the outlines of a possible package . But we 're going to continue to consult with Congress and our G-7 allies on that . Q ? We will not then make any kind of announcement during the two-day meeting ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : The meeting 's not over yet . Q Is that when you 're going to make one ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I 'm not ruling out the possibility . Q the President 's going to announce it tomorrow . Q Bentsen said that . Q Yes , Bentsen said it would be tomorrow . Q So did Christopher . MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I 'd have to look at that , but I believe it is more likely that the announcement will come out of Tokyo . Q George , has there been further consideration here about going to -- sending the President out to Los Angeles ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I do n't know that there 's -- it 's not something we 've ruled out . We do n't have a date set for it . Q George , you all have a position or do you support Immigration 's plan to settle 4,000 Iraqi prisoners in the United States ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : It 's the first I 've heard of it . Q George , there was a report today about the -- Q Fortunately . ( Laughter . ) Q about the pace of appointments and says that President Clinton is behind President Bush in the number of positions that people have been nominated for . Are you going to speed up the pace of nominations or where do you stand with it ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : We filled 814 of the President 's appointments . And it 's broken down -- we have 384 Schedule C ; 147 noncareer SES ; 213 PAS full-time . I 'm not sure what that means -- ( laughter ) -- 70 PA full-time . And this is about the same -- it 's about the same pace of President Bush . Obviously , as you move along farther , once you -- each level of appointment actually has a multiplier effect and frees up far more appointments . So we expect the process to speed up . But we 're at the pace of Bush . Obviously we 'd like to get these done as quickly as possible . I would point out that the FBI background checks and the background check is far more comprehensive and it takes more time than our predecessors , and that is part of the holdup . But we 're working on it . Q Is that because of Nannygate ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I think that 's an awful big part of it , yes . Q In the story this morning , you were at approximately the same pace as Bush in making appointments , but way behind in winning confirmations . MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : That 's where the background checks comes into play . That 's the problem . Q That 's the background checks problem ? Because I mean , you have a Democratic Senate -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : No , that 's not the -- you make the appointments , and then it takes quite a bit of time to fill out all the forms and have the background checks done . That 's exactly where the problem is . Q What 's the President doing this afternoon , and what 's on the plan for tomorrow ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : He 's got some meetings -- just office meetings this afternoon for the most part , on a variety of issues that -- probably a half-dozen different issues . And then he 'll be -- tomorrow we 'll have an event , probably again focused on the stimulus and jobs package out of here at the White House . And Friday is the Miyazawa meeting . Q Will you be releasing his tax return tomorrow , George ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Either tomorrow or Friday . Q Is there going to be a pre-briefing regarding the Japanese Prime Minister 's visit tomorrow ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I do n't know about tomorrow , but we 'll probably get something done , as we usually do , for these visits . Q Was Reverend Jackson here this morning and do you know what that was about ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : He was here . He met with a group of us here at the White House , including Mack McLarty . Q Who ? Q Reverend Jackson . MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Reverend Jackson . Mack McLarty , me , Gene Sperling , Bruce Reed , Jeff Watson , Mark Gearan . Q Talking about Haiti ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : We talked about general urban policy . He is about to go to Los Angeles . He was just back from Mississippi , where we had a good victory last night ; and he 's going on to Los Angeles . Q Did he request the meeting ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Actually , no . He 's in continual contact with the President . He had written a letter on a variety of issues , and so we asked him to come in and talk about it . Q George , Dole is having a fundraiser for Jeffords tonight in Vermont . Have you guys been in contact with Jeffords at all on this ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I think there 's been some contact , sure . Q Can you tell us about the contacts ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I 'm not sure -- Q Do you know who contacted him or what was said ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I know that Howard Paster talked to him and they just has a general talk about the package . Q And did he express his support for it now , or is he -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I ca n't divulge the details of the conversation , but there have been conversations . Q The L.A. Times is reporting that abortion -- elective abortions is likely to be included in the basic health care package . Is this something the President is considering ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Again -- Q Along with the VAT ? ( Laughter . ) MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : It 's certainly something that 's been looked at , but no decisions have been made . Q What was the question ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : The L.A. Times story on whether abortions will be covered by the President 's health plan . Q Did the President in his meeting -- did you in your meeting with Reverend Jackson ask his advice , solicit his advice about what kind of stance the White House should take in the wake of the verdict in L.A. ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Well , we certainly talked about the situation in Los Angeles and the long-term prospects for economic development and other issues . Q For instance , did you discuss whether it would be helpful for the President to go there or not ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Well , we discussed a wide range of issues related to Los Angeles . That was certainly one of them . Q Letting you perhaps go out on the way you came in , I need to go back to Bosnia just for a second and ask -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Oh , good . Q your reaction to Margaret Thatcher 's comments that you 're just sitting by and watching a massacre . MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Well , we 've been pushing very hard on a number of fronts for more aggressive action . We will continue to do that . Q Can you tell us if you 've made any progress in your talks on the stimulus package getting a compromise ? I mean , we do n't have any feel except talks are ongoing . Have you talked to like 20 people or -- MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I do n't know the numbers . We 've talked to several people and we 've had wide-ranging sessions . Q Anyone leaning your way ? MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : I ca n't get into that . We 're just going to keep working through Tuesday . THE PRESS : Thank you . END 1:10 P.M. EDT # 56-04/14

From : betz @ gozer.idbsu.edu ( Andrew Betz ) Subject : Randy Weaver trial update : Day 1 . Nntp-Posting-Host : gozer Organization : SigSauer Fan Club Lines : 49 Here is a copy of my first update on the Randy Weaver trial . After a large response ( about 15 email messages ) , I 've decided that there is sufficient interest here on t.p.g . to warrant posting . *** file follows *** Hi Folks ; As perhaps the only Boise resident on the list , I guess it kind of falls on me to keep people updated about the Randy Weaver/Kevin Harris trial . Yesterday marked the seating of the jury . Apparently no other legal activities occurred . The jury was selected and things start today . More interesting is what happenned outside . About a dozen Weaver supporters showed up to stage a protest outside the courthouse . One woman carried a sign that read , `` Who stands trial for the murder of Vicki and ( son 's name - I forget ) Weaver ? '' On the evening news she said , `` I am here protesting because I believe in freedom of speech and freedom of religion . I thought we all did . '' Nice sound bite ( grin ) ! The news reporter also interviewed some guy named `` Tim '' who refused to give his last name . Not to prejudge the guy , but he looked like a neo-nazi . He also said he expected many neo-nazis to show up throughout the trial . `` Tim '' had been handing out leaflets in support of Weaver and Harris and the news had footage of a Boise cop telling him to move along or he 'd arrest . I do n't know the finer points of this one . Perhaps there 's a law against political activity within X feet of a courthouse or something ( what happenned to the First Amendment ? ! ? ) . Most ominous of all was that the local reporter filmed an agent of the Gestapo ... err ... ATF with a minicam FILMING THE PROTESTORS ! Welcome to the world of Big Brother . Anyhow , Gerry Spence came out and asked the protestors to leave because he did n't think it would help Weaver 's case any . He said he was confident that , once the evidence came out , that Weaver would be aquitted . More stuff as it comes available . Drew

If you could find the specs this might just work for you ... I believe that the `` A-D converters '' found on a joystick port are really timers that tick off how long it takes an R-C circuit ( the R being your paddle ) to charge up to something like 1/2 Vcc . For games this works pretty well , but you certainly would n't want to try to take lab measurements off something as non-linear as that . Hmm ... I suppose you could linearize it in software , but the real problem is that the precision of your measurement is no longer constant ( higher voltages would be more precise ) . On the other hand , I could be wrong and perhaps the game card designers splurged for the extra $ .50 to make a cheap constant current source out of an op amp . But I would n't expect that ... -- -Joel Kolstad

Firstly , what do you exactly mean by `` fundamentalist '' ? I will for the time being assume that what you mean is that your friend believes that the bible is God 's word to mankind ?

Secondly , why he may be very persuasive is because from his point of view , he has been on `` both sides of the fence '' . This I mean that before he turned `` fundamentalist '' , you two are agreeable because both of you see things from the same side . If suddenly , as if a new world of reality has suddenly opened up to him , it is like the discovery of let 's say a new continent , or a new planet . To him , he's got to tell you because he has seen something much more wonderful than where he was , and what he thinks is much better than where you are now . You have got to realise that from his point of view , he means well to you , eventhough he may end up offending you . To him , it is worth that risk . Nevertheless , it is really up to him to respect where you stand and listen to you as well . At this moment , it may be difficult because he is either very excited or feel it is too urgent to keep quiet about , however , he may not realise that he 's really putting you off . [ ... ] > the Bible that it is so . ' So my question is , how can I convince him > that this is a subject better left undiscussed , so we can preserve > what is ( in all areas other than religious beliefs ) a great > friendship ? How do I convince him that I am 'beyond saving ' so he > wo n't try ? Thanks for any advice . So far , I 've only been trying to explain things from his side . However , I do understand how you feel too , because I was n't a Christian for a good part of my life as well . I was quite turned off by Christians or '' fundamentalists '' who were really all out and enthusiastic about their faith . They really scared me , to tell you the truth . Unfortunately , '' religious belief '' is a very personal thing , just as your agnosticism is also a very personal thing to you . Since the Christian belief is inevitably at odds with anything non-Christian ( religious or otherwise ) , it will be a touchy matter . Like all friendships , it will take both sides to do their part to make it work . In this matter , maybe you can do your part by telling him nicely that you are not able to dig what he's trying to convince you about , that it 's beyond you or not your concern '' for now '' . Do n't tell him it 's nonsense , because to him it is reality - and that would be a real insult . He 'll also have to be careful not to insult where you stand too . Like I said before , I wish I could give your friend some advice too . I 'll admit that I did similarly to some of my friends when I became a Christian . In some ways , I wish I could have done things a little differently . However , it was difficult then because I was so excited and just blabbered away about what I 've found ! To me , it was too good not to know . To some , I was crazy , and I did n't really care most of the time what they thought . You will probably think he 's crazy too - but God is very real to him , as real as you are to him . Keep that in mind . And he thinks he can convince you because since God is so real to him , he does n't see why God ca n't be real to you too . I do n't know how helpful this is to you . But all the best anyhow - this is quite a challenge for you to face . By the way , personal conviction : nobody is `` beyond saving '' except the one we call the devil and his hosts .

I do n't mind Stewart calling a penalty in the last 5 min . of the game , but AT LEAST BE FAIR ABOUT IT . The Nords were caught with their hand in the cookie jar more than once .

The winning goal should n't have gone in . Do n't get me wrong , I 'm not blaming the loss on Stewart .

The only downside - your case wo n't close , but for a homebrew system , that may not be a problem . Do n't know about performance , though .

Bill , you are kidding yourself here . Firstly , motorcycles do not steer themselves - only the rider can do that . Secondly , it is the adhesion of the tyre on the road , the suspension geometry and the ground clearance of the motorcycle which dictate how quickly you can swerve to avoid obstacles , and not the knowledge of physics between the rider 's ears . Are you seriously suggesting that countersteering knowledge enables you to corner faster or more competentlY than you could manage otherwise ? ? > Mike , I 'm extremely gratified for you that you have such a natural > affinity and prowess for motorcycling that formal training was a total > waste of time for you ( assuming your total `` training '' has n't come from > simply from reading rec.motorcycles ) . However , 90 % + of the motorcyclists > I 've discussed formal rider education with have regarded the experience > as overwhelmingly positive . This regardless of the amount of experience > they brought into the course ( ranging from 10 minutes to 10+ years ) . Formal training in this country ( as far as I am aware ) does not include countersteering theory . I found out about countersteering about six years ago , from a physics lecturer who was also a motorcyclist . I did n't believe him at first when he said I steered my bike to the right to make it turn left , but I went out and analysed closely what I was doing , and realized he was right ! It 's an interesting bit of knowledge , and I 've had a lot of fun since then telling others about it , who were at first as sceptical as I was . But that 's all it is - an interesting bit of knowledge , and to claim that it is essential for all bikers to know it , or that you can corner faster or better as a result , is absurd . Formal training is in my view absolutely essential if you 're going to be able to ride a bike properly and safely . But by including countersteering theory in newbie courses we are confusing people unnecessarily , right at the time when there are *far* more important matters for them to learn . And that was my original point . Mike

Actually , I find Limbaugh 's oratory less than sizzling and his debating skills sometimes lacking , even though his conclusions are often correct . I would suggest that a bankrupt leftist ideology that hopes to use concentrated political power and a loaded gun to force everyone to do the `` right '' things ( where `` right '' is defined by the elitist academics who lead the movement ) is showing an acute case of `` myopic social perspective '' , not to mention arrogance and utter stupidity . Limbaugh is certainly far from perfect , but his opponents in the established body politic and the media are the ones arguing for Federal control of virtually all aspects of the lives of the Citizenry , and for the elimination of local control over Affairs Public . Perhaps Limbaugh has a following because The People are tired of being treated like errant children by a self-important group of arrogant controlling myopic people who have no understanding of how life operates outside of the `` oughta-be 's '' inside their own hopelessly closed minds . > The last point is glaringly documented by passages in the opening > pages of both books .

Hmmm , `` Congress shall pass no law regarding an establishment of religion , nor prohibiting the free exercise thereof . '' Liberal translation : `` the federal government ( as long as it is run by Liberals ) may force local school districts to include certain iconic content in Christmas displays , while prohibiting others .

For > example : This should be great fun , since it is the Liberal movement in America that is pushing the hardest for centralized fascist control of The People and business ( government/business 'partnership ' indeed ) , and Mr. Limbaugh is the populist nemesis of that movement .

'' ( pages 266 , 21 , 299 and 273 , respectively . ) You neglect to mention that Mr. Limbaugh ( have you ever listened to his show , BTW ? ) continuously encourages his audience to think for themselves rather than blindly following any media icon , himself included . You yourself mention that he makes no bones about his show being strictly about his own opinions . He also adopts a rather satirical approach , and presumes his audience to be intelligent enough to distinguish satire from seriousness ( and he says as much ) . This is in contrast to the average mass-media show , in which the audience is treated as society 's intellectual lowest common denominator . I am sure that Adolf Hitler was a master of satire ; I am sure he was just kidding when he said that the Jews were the cause of Germany 's problems and needed to be exterminated . > On Religion as the Basis of a Nation > Hitler : `` In this world human culture and civilization are > inseperably bound up with the existence of the Aryan .

'' ( Page 581 . ) This is not religion , it is clearly a perverse worship of race . Since Christ was a Jew , it seems quite unlikely that Hitler 's characterization of the Aryan as `` the highest image of the Lord '' fits with Christian doctrine . > Limbaugh : `` America was founded as a Judeo-Christian country ... > But our intellectual and political elites are often either hostile or > ambivalent toward religion ...

'' ( pages 274-5 . ) Private religious schools have a vastly better record of success than publicly funded schools . American history is indeed primarily Judeo- Christian . I suppose that Mr. Limbaugh pointing out facts is equivalent to Adolf Hitler worshiping the Aryan race . I think you might be reaching just a wee bit here . > On Popular Culture as a Reason for Social Collapse > Hitler : `` The fight against the poisoning of the soul has to set in ... > One has only to look at the menus of our movie houses , vaudevilles and > theatres ; and one can hardly deny that this is not the right kind of food ... > Theatre , art , literature , movies , the press , billposters and window displays > must be cleaned of the symptoms of a rotting world and put into the > service of a moral idea of State and culture . '' ( pages 346 and 348 . ) Definite suggestion that the government should control the entertainment industry here . > Limbaugh : `` Today , Hollywood is in trouble . The reason [ is ] that > Hollywood has forgotten who its audience is ... They make fun of people > who believe in God . They ridicule the traditional family , heterosexuality > and monagamy . They disparage American heroes . '' ( page 254 . ) Just a guess here , but I do n't think that Mr. Limbaugh would advocate government control of Hollywood . You should perhaps call his radio show to confirm this . I believe this is more a criticism of Hollywood and the depraved moral values it espouses , not an advocation of government control of Hollywood . 90 's Liberals , on the other hand , want to have complete government control of our school systems , so that the government can teach The People at an early age the `` right '' way to view religion and morality . I believe Mr. Limbaugh is against this , as his satirical use of the `` young heads full of mush '' hyperbole indicates . > On the News Meida > Hitler : `` The activity of the so-called liberal press was the work of > gravediggers for the German people and the German Reich .

'' ( pages 270 and 268 . ) Indication here that `` Elements of the Media '' ( since career is a self-selected categorization , perhaps an inferred 'larger percentage than represented in the populace at large ' ) has a leftist bias . Does n't sound too unreasonable . No insinuation that CNN should not report in an objective fashion , only that for reporters to say that they do not have any personal bias in the situation is disingenuous to megalomaniacal . You may disagree , and it may well be exagerrated , but it is not an unreasonable opinion ; and Mr. Limbaugh goes well out of his way to make sure that his audience knows that these are his opinions , unlike most other reporting that purports to achieve perfect objectivity but in actuality will in some degree or other , in a statistical sense , reflect the biases of the reporters . Who is being disingenuous here , Mr. Shaw or Mr. Limbaugh ? Again , you should ask Mr. Limbaugh himself , but I expect that he would oppose government control of the media . > * * * > To continue these comparative excerpts is certainly possible , but > ultimately too depressing to take in one reading . It is indeed depressing to see such myopia and tiresome Liberal arrogance . Liberals love to play games with paradigms as a way of discrediting people who disagree with them . Why do n't you challenge conservative ideology on an intellectual level rather than engaging in ludicrous comparisons ? Perhaps the underpinnings of your ideology are intellectual only in that they exist in your mind , not the real world . > After putting these books down , there is one undeniable fact that > haunts me .

Perhaps there are a few among the intellectually challenged who percieve Rush Limbaugh as a hate-monger , but in my experience he has been spreading laughter at the ludicrous self-importance of the Left , not hatred . As to Mr. Bush , you may be correct about his fascist economic leanings . Mr. Reagan , on the other hand , did his best to reverse the fascist trend of government involvement in business . Mr. Clinton is increasing fascism in America through `` business/government partnership '' and increased levels of taxation . Perhaps you should not have skipped your vocabulary classes in grade school . > And if Limbaugh is not as repellant a Hitler , it is only because the > radical right utilizes Limbaugh as its own gateway opiate . One can only > wonder what the ultimate drug is they plan to hook America on . Hmmm . Seems to me that Limbaugh is not in any way comparable to Hitler because he has not murdered six million Jews and many , many others out of racism . I come from a mixed-race family , so I am quite well attuned to racism ; I do n't hear any coming from Rush Limbaugh . The only place I hear racism coming from these days and being taken seriously is from the Liberal Left . The Liberal Left is the movement I see trying to get America hooked on the opiates of Socialized Medicine , Socialized Transportation , Socialized Education , etc . The Left already has America hopelessly addicted to that Liberal drug , the Social Security Chain Letter . It is quite clear to me that while the Hitler analogy does not really apply to either Rush Limbaugh or William Jefferson Clinton , if one of the two is closer than the other it is clearly the Fascist Clinton . > The Madison Edge can be reached at PO Box 845 , Madison , WI 53701- > 0845 ; ( 608 ) 255-4460 . > > -- - 30 -- - This is the same address as `` Idiots Anonymous '' , is n't it ?

That 's because truth may be absolute , but it may not be obvious . Like so many things , the truth is always subject to misinterpretation . I strongly suspect that we are reaching an impasse here , which is why I deign from commenting much further . > > Sure . The Bible preaches absolute truths .

Maybe it is n't at all crystal clear to *me* that > their fundamental principles are either fundamental *or* principles . Now hold it . I never said that Christians can not be arrogant . Indeed , as many other Christians on SRC have stressed before , this is a trap that Christians must always be wary about . However , this does not mean that if you believe in the absolutes established by the Bible , you are necessarily being arrogant . A Christian can believe that the Word of God is absolute , but he or she should not expect this to be immediately evident to everyone . > So , I think that your position is : > The Bible is absolute truth , but as we are prone to error in our > interpretation , we can not reliably determine if we have figured out > what that truth is . > Did I get that right ? Not quite . You say that according to my stance , we can not *reliably* determine what is true . That is not what I said . I say that as fallible human beings , we can not discern the truth with 100 % certainty . The distinction is subtle yet important . When a scientist performs an experiment , he can claim that his results are reliable , without claiming that absolutely no mistake whatsoever could have been made . In other words , he can admit that he could be mistaken , without sacrificing his convictions . Nobody can establish what absolute truth is with 100 % certainty . Throughout the centuries , philosophers have argued about what we can know with complete certainty and what we can not . Descartes made a step in the right direction when he uttered , `` Cogito , ergo sum , '' yet we have not advanced much beyond that . Do you believe that other people aside from you exist ? Do you believe that the computer terminal you are using exists ? If so , can you be absolutely certain about that ? Are you sure it is not some grand illusion ? Of course , you have no such assurance . This does not mean , however , that for all practical purposes , you can be certain that they exist . So it is with Christianity . The most mature Christians I know have deep convictions about absolute morality , yet they acknowledge that there is a non-zero probability that they are wrong . This does not , however , mean that they should ( or do ) abandon these absolutes . > What 's the point of spending all this time claiming and defending > absolute truth , when we can never know what those truths are , and we > can never ( or at least should n't ) act upon them ?

Those who do n't want to discuss its merits and drawbacks are not forced to do so . However I would make anybody who incites others to harm me or harass in a personal manner , legally responsible for their deeds . I can not accept and will not accept threats to my personal integrity and I urge anybody who opposes terror to refrain from direct or indriect threats . PS : My proposal has nothing to do with Nazi eugenics . It has to do with the search for peace which would enable justice . I do n't consider that justice is done , when non-Jews who fled or were expelled in 1948/1967 are not permitted to return to their homeland . This can at best be called pragmatism , a nice word for legitimizing the rule of the strong . It can never be called justice . And peace without justice will never be peace . It is my conviction that the situation in which a state , through the law , attempts to discourage mixed marriages ( as Israel does ) , is not normal . Such a state resembles more Nazi Germany and South Africa than Western democracies , such as the United States , in which Jews are free to marry whom they wish and do so in the thousands . My proposal may have drawbacks but it is meant to force anybody to anything , just to compensate for a certain time mixed couples for the hardships tehy endure in a society which disapproves of intermarriage.When the day will come and Israel will become a truly civil and decmoractic society , in which the state is not concerned with the religious or ethnic affiliation of its constituency , such a Fund would not be needed any more . I do n't mind if Jews wish to marry Jews and keep their traditions , why not ? But this is not the affairs of a state . Western democracy clearly separates these domains and I am certain that most American Jews enjoy this fact and would not love to live in a state termed Christian State and to have their Green cards stamped with a mark JEW . I would ask those who are genuinely interested in an exchange of views and personal experiencces to refrain from emotional , infantile outbursts which might leed readers to infer that Jews who respect Judaism are uncivilized . Such behaviour is not good for Judaism . Elias

We ran into one of my relatives at the bus station and got to talking . A lot of people had gathered not far away , near the store . Well at first we did n't know what was happening , and then a fellow I know comes up to me , an Azerbaijani guy , and says , `` What are you standing here for ? Go home immediately ! '' I asked , `` What 's going on ? '' He says , '' What 's the matter , ca n't you see , they 've overturned a car and they 're killing Armenians ! '' He helped me catch a cab and we got home safely . We sat at home for two days . During that time a gang of bandits came into our courtyard . But the neighbors would n't let them in the building . There were about 80 of them . They had sticks and pieces of armatures in their hands . They were shouting something , but you could n't understand it . It was n't one voice or two , all of them were shouting in a chorus . They turned toward Building 35 . They went up to the third _floor , and we see that they 're breaking glass and throwing things out the window . After a while they come out the entryway : one has a pair of jeans in his hands , another has a tape recorder , and a third a guitar . They went on toward the auto parts store . We had to save ourselves . After midnight on March 1 we went to hide at School No . 33 , which is in Microdistrict 13 . There were two other Armenian families there with us . There were 13 of us altogether . Out of all of them I had only known Ernest before , he had moved to Sumgait from Kirovabad . The Azerbaijani guard at the school let us in . At first he did n't want to , but there was nowhere else for us to go . We had to plead with him and talk him into it . We were told that on that day , the 1st , there would be an attack on our microdistrict . We went upstairs to a classroom on the second floor . On the city radio station they announced three telephone numbers that could be used to summon assistance or communicate anything important . I called one of them and the First Secretary of the Sumgait City Party Committee answered . I asked him for assistance . I say , `` We 're in School No . 33 , we need to be evacuated . '' Well he says , `` Got it , wait there , I 'm sending out help now . '' I know his voice . The First Secretary had been to our plant , I had spoken with him personally . When I called he said , `` Muslimzade here . '' About two hours after the call we heard shouts near the school . We looked out the window and about 100 to 120 people were outside saying , `` Armenians , come out , we 're here to get you . '' They have clubs , axes , and armature shafts in their hands . The guard sat there with us , and asked , `` Where should I go ? '' I say , `` If your life is of any value to you you 'll go down there and say that the Armenians were here and that they left . '' That 's what he did . He went down there and said , `` The Armenians were here , '' he said , `` I let them out the back door , they went that way . '' And pointed with his hand . And with shouts and noise the mob set off in the direction he had pointed . So the assistance we had been promised did come . They sent us help , all right ! Instead of sending real soldiers he had sent his own . I am positive that Muslimzade did that . No one had seen us entering the school , no one knew that we were there . In any case , we stayed at the school until seven in the morning , and no soldiers of any sort came to our aid . In the morning we went to my relative 's in Microdistrict 1 , and the soldiers took us to the SK club from there . The club was jammed with people , and there were lots of people ahead of us -- there was no space available . One small boy , about three months old , died right in my arms . There was n't a single doctor , nothing . The boy was uninjured , there were no wounds or bruises on him . He was just very ill . They gave him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation , they did everything they could under the circumstances , but were unable to save him . And his mother and father , a young Armenian couple , were right there , on the floor ... I searched for a spot for us in the SK , we have a small child of our own , I wanted to find a room or something to put my family in . I went up to the third floor , there were a lot of soldiers up there , bandaged , with canes , limping , with their heads broken open . They were a terrible sight . Young guys , all of them . There were a lot of bandaged Armenians , too . Everyone had been beaten , everyone was crying , wailing , and calling for help . I think that the City Party Committee ignored us completely . True , there was a snack bar : a sausage was 30 kopeks or 40 kopeks , a package of cookies that cost 26 kopeks was being sold for 50 , a bottled soft drink cost a ruble . . . But there was no way to get the things any cheaper . I met my old uncle , Aram Mikhailovich , there . He saw me and tears welled up in his eyes . My whole life he had told me that we were friendly peoples , that we worked together , he always had Azerbaijanis over at his house . And now he saw me and there was nothing he could say , he just cried . You can understand his feelings , of course .

The discussion is not about whether there were tanks used in sixties riots ; instead , it is about whether those tanks fired their main guns in one of those riots . You claim they did . That claim is ludicrous . Awesley replied : I repeated what I had been told , under what context I had heard it , supporting the claim that tanks were indeed used in Detroit in 67 . The issue has never been whether tanks were used in Detroit in 1967 . It has been whether they fired their main guns . You did not merely claim that tanks were used -- you claimed that they fired their main guns to suppress sniper fire and that they were `` quite '' effective at this . You continue to back away from this claim and defend something else that nobody is disputing . Awesley went on : I spent a few minutes in a library today -- found their computer was down and they do n't have a card catalog . Anyway , it took about 10 minutes to find this in _Nightmare in Detroit , A Rebellion and It's Victims_ by Sauter and Hines , on page 133 , telling of the death of Tonia Blanding , age 4 . `` When the tank was fired upon by snipers it turned in the direction the shots came from . [ ... ] the fifty-caliber machine gun mounted on the tank belched fire into the buildings . After a short round into the front of the buildings , the tank guns spit again , tearing apart huge holes out of the side of the apartment . '' Well , it 's not the main gun . `` Well , it 's not the main gun . '' Gee , that 's only the entire point . Are you now going to admit that you were wrong ? I wrote : will I see any pictures of tanks firing their main guns ? Will I see pictures of buildings damaged by the shells ? Will I read the reports of the tank fire ? I 'll bet you dollar to doughnuts I wo n't . It will take more than second-hand accounts from a few old National Guard sergeants shooting the shit to convince me that tanks shelled American cities in the Sixties . Awesley replied : Well , if you bothered to read them , it would n't take long at all to find reports of tank * fire * -- although not necessarily of the main guns . I will never read of tanks firing their main guns in Detroit in the '67 riots . There is simply no way that such an event could have taken place without it being common knowledge even 26 years later . The American military firing shells from tanks in American cities on blacks would have been *big* news . Awesley goes on : You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers . To fire fragmentary grenades ? I doubt that as well . To fire concussion grenades ? Perhaps . To fire tear gas ? Certainly . But you would be perfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags , would n't you , since it makes your other claim seem more plausible . And on : I don't expect to convince you ; you 'll have to open your mind and eyes and actually do a little research to be convinced one way or the other . Let me know what you find . I already know what you found : nothing . If I claimed that the Marines used F-4s to launch rockets at buildings in Trenton , New Jersey would you believe me ? Would you suspend judgment until you had a chance to research it ? Or would your bullshit filters kick in ? If tanks had fired their main guns in Detroit , people would have been screaming about it for the past two and half decades . I would know about it . Unless you also claim that the National Guard managed to cover it up . If your mind is open enough to believe that , well , good for you . I prefer to live in reality . And here in reality , I find it hard to believe that those tanks even had any shells , much less fired them . -- John L. Scott

From : goltz @ mimi.UU.NET ( James P. Goltz ) Subject : Orion drive in vacuum -- how ? Organization : UUNET Technologies Inc , Falls Church , VA , USA Lines : 31 NNTP-Posting-Host : mimi.uu.net Background : The Orion spacedrive was a theoretical concept . It would be a drive using thermonuclear explosions to drive a spacecraft . The idea was that you 'd detonate devices with somewhere from one to ten megatons yield behind a `` pusher plate '' attached to the main spacecraft . The shock wave from the explosions would transfer momentum to the ship . Now , in an atmosphere I can see this . The energy of the explosion heats the atmosphere , which expands explosively and slams a shock wave into the pusher plate . But in a vacuum , only two things I can see are going to hit the plate : fission/fusion products ( barium , krypton , helium , neutrons , evaporated bomb casing ) and electromagnetic radiation ( gammas mostly , some light/heat from irradiated fission products ) . Would this work ? I ca n't see the EM radiation impelling very much momentum ( especially given the mass of the pusher plate ) , and it seems to me you 're going to get more momentum transfer throwing the bombs out the back of the ship than you get from detonating them once they 're there . I must be missing something . Would someone enlighten me via email ? Thanks . -- -- Jim -- - Jim Goltz AlterNet Engineer goltz @ uunet.uu.net

I would go further , and say that much of the damage to the environment has been caused by the secular worldview , or by the humanist worldview , and especially by the secular humanist worldview . This is not to say that ALL secular humanists are necessarily avid destroyers of the environment , and I am sure that there are many who are concerned about the environment . But at the time of the Renaissance and Ref ormation in Western Europe man became the centre , or the focus of culture ( hence `` humanism '' ) . This consciousness was also secular , in the sense that it was concerned primarily with the present age , r ather than the age to come . Capitalism arose at the same time , and the power of economics became central in philosophy . This does n't mean that economics did not exist before , simply that it began to dominate the conscious cultural values of Western European society and its offshoots . This cultural shift was , in its later stages , accompanied by industrial revolutions and the values that justified them . There was a fundamental cultural shift in the meaning of `` economics '' - from the Christian view of man as the economos , the steward , of creation to the secular idea of man as the slave of economic forces and powers . There were denominational differences among the new worshippers of Mammon . For some the name of the deity was `` the free rein of the market mechanism '' , while for others it was `` the dialectical forces of history '' . But in both the capitalist West and the socialist East the environment was sacrificed on the altar of Mammon . The situation was mitigated in the West because thos e who were concerned about the damage to the environment had more freedom to oppose what was happening and state their case .

Well -- -*I* know of ... . Anyways , cannibalism is much more commmon than those who feel that it is wrong ( and then point out that the fact that western civilisation does n't do it is PROOF positive that we are more advanced ) would have us believe . Cannibalism is often used in funeral ceremonies as a way of keeping the deceased loved one alive . Many other cultures ( including many American Indian cultures ) eat/ate the flesh of slain enemies , often as a way of showing respect for the valor of the departed . Hearts are often favored for this , as it contains the spirit . Have you ever read or seen `` Alive '' , which is the story of the Argentinian boys soccer team that crashed in the Andes and then ate the bodies of those who died in order to survive ?

But do you really believe that this is the reason ? | > Could you provide evidence that this is the case and that it | > serves no other purpose ? A number of points . You are making assumptions about the manner in which the cards are used . True , by law , all residents , citizens , and tourists must carry a form of identification with them . For citizens , the standard ID is the ID card . The purpose this serves on a daily basis , wherein they are presented at public places , is for the purpose of identifying the bearer . This takes place in banks ( cashing checks ) , post offices ( registered mail and such ) , etc ... Quite frankly , it was rare that I ever had to present my ID card for such activities more than once per week . There is no law or requirement that forces people to wave their ID cards in public . Furthermore , none of the services I outlined discriminate against the bearer in any manner by having access to this information . The only case that I can think of in which the Le'um field might be taken into account is during interaction with the police , based upon the scenario . In general though , arab citizens are clearly recognizable , as are non-arabs . Your argument therefore becomes moot unless you can provide an example of how this field is being used to discriminate against them officially . | > In the answer to my second questions , concerning the fact that | > Israel has no fixed borders , you state that Israel 's borders were | > 'shaped and reshaped by both war and peace ' .

I take issue with your assertions . I think that Arab countries do know that they have nothing to fear from `` Israeli expansionism '' . Militarily , Israel is not capable of holding onto large tracts of land under occupation to a hostile , armed , and insurgent population for a sustained period of time . As is , the intifada is heavily taxing the Israeli economy . Proof of this can be seen in the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon . Israeli troops pulled back from the Awali , and later from the Litani , in order to control the minimal strip needed to keep towns out of range of Katyusha missile fire . Public opinion in Israel has turned towards settling the intifada via territorial concessions . The Israel public is sufferring from battle fatigue of sorts and the gov't is aware of it . With regards to borders , let me state the following . I may not agree with the manner in which negotiations are being held , however the crux of the matter is that everyone either makes or refrains from stating a starting position . The arab parties have called for total withdrawal and a return to pre-48 borders . If Israel were to state large borders , the negotiations might never get under way . If Israel were to state smaller borders , then the arab countries might try and force even smaller borders during the negotiations . I think that leaving the matter to be settled by negotiations and peace treaties is infinitely more realistic and sensible . | > Your answer to my third question is typical of a Stalinist public | > official . I do n't think your answer is honest . You refer me to | > Vanunu 's revelations about Israel 's nuclear arsenal without | > evaluating the truthfullness of his revelations . Now if he said | > the truth , then why should he been punished , and if he lied , why | > should he be punished ? I would appreciate more honesty . Your statement is typical of the simple minded naivety of a `` center for policy research '' . Whether or not all of Vanunu 's revelations were true has no bearing on the fact that some were . For disclosing `` state secrets '' after having signed contracts and forms with the understanding that said secrets are not to be made public , one should be punished . As to which were and which were n't , I am under no moral obligation to disclose that - quite the reverse in fact . He was taken to court , tried , and found guilty . You may take issue with a number of things but clearly you have no understanding of the concept of `` Secrets of state '' , something which every democratic govt has . | > Somebody provided an answer to the fourth question , concerning | > 'hidden prisoners ' in Israeli prisons .

I noticed that he was documenting the fact that such prisoners could exist more than he documented the fact that they do exist . The CLU noted , which you evidently did not pay attention to , that they know of no such reports or cases . I am sorry to tell you but in a country of 4 mill , as tightly knit as Israel , even if the matter of the arrest was not made public , within a relatively short time frame , most people would know about it . My own feelings are that the matter of the arrest should be made public unless a court order is issued allowing a delay of X hours . This would be granted only if a judge could be convinced that an announcement would cause irreparable harm to the ongoing investigation . | > You imply that my questions show bias and are formulated in such a | > way to 'cast aspersions upon Israel ' .

This is a sign of weakness , not of strength . Well , I am sorry to say that your questions are slanted . Such questions are often termed `` tabloid journalism '' and are not disturbing because they avoid any attempt at objectivity . Such questions were often used during the McCarthy era as a basis for the witch-hunts that took place then . To use your own example , these questions might have been lifted from the format used by Stalinist prosecutors that were looking for small bits of evidence that they could distort and portray as a larger and dirtier picture . My answers were not any more `` hysterical '' than the questions themselves . The problem is not that the q 's were provocative , it was that they were selective in their fact seeking . You fall into the same category of those who seek `` yes '' `` no '' answers when the real answer is `` of sorts '' . I suspect that as long as the answers to these questions is not an unequivocal NO , you would remain unsatified and choose to interprete them as you see fit . A sign of strength is the ability to look You remind me of those mistaken environmentalists who once advocated culling wolves because of the cruelty to deer , only to find that they had broken the food chain and wreaked havoc upon the very environment they sought to protect .

I walked by , and they were showing real-time video capture using a ( Radious or SuperMac ? ) card to digitize and make right on the spot quicktime movies . I think the quicktime they were using was the old one ( 1.5 ) . They digitized a guy talking there in 160x2xx something . It played back quite nicely and in real time . The guy then expanded the window ( resized ) to 25x by 3xx ( 320 in y I think ) and the frame rate decreased enough to notice that it was n't 30fps ( or about 30fps ) anymore . It dropped to like 15 fps . Then he increased it just a bit more , and it dropped to 10 < - > 12 fps . Then I asked him what Mac he was using ... He was using a Quadra ( do n't know what model , 900 ? ) to do it , and he was telling the guys there that the Quicktime could play back at the same speed even on an LCII . Well , I spoiled his claim so to say , since a 68040 Quadra Mac was having a little bit of trouble . And this was n't even from the hardisk ! This was from memory ! Could it be that you saw either a newer version of quicktime , or some hardware assisted Centris , or another software product running the animation ( like supposedly MacroMind 's Accelerator ? ) ? Do n't misunderstand me , I just want to clarify this . But for the sake of the posting about a computer doing it or not , I can claim 320x200 ( a tad more with overscan ) being done in 256,000+ colors in my computer ( not from the hardisk ) at 30fps with Scala MM210 . But I agree , if we consider MPEG stuff , I think a multimedia consumer low-priced box has a lot of market ...

Oh yeah , Israel was really ready to `` expand its borders '' on the holiest day of the year ( Yom Kippur ) when the Arabs attacked in 1973 . Oh wait , you chose to omit that war ... perhaps because it 100 % supports the exact OPPOSITE to the point you are trying to make ? I do n't think that it's because it was the war that hit Israel the hardest . Also , in 1967 it was Egypt , not Israel who kicked out the UN force . In 1948 it was the Arabs who refused to accept the existance of Israel BASED ON THE BORDERS SET BY THE UNITED NATIONS . In 1956 , Egypt closed off the Red Sea to Israeli shipping , a clear antagonistic act . And in 1982 the attack was a response to years of constant shelling by terrorist organizations from the Golan Heights . Children were being murdered all the time by terrorists and Israel finally retaliated . Nowhere do I see a war that Israel started so that the borders could be expanded .

Also remember that every dollar spent keeping one spacecraft in safe mode ( probably a spin-stabilized sun-pointing orientation ) is a dollar not spent on mission analysis for a newer spacecraft . In order to turn the spacecraft back on , you either need to insure that the Ops guys will be available , or you need to retrain a new team . Having said that , there are some spacecraft that do what you have proposed . Many of the operational satellites Goddard flies ( like the Tiros NOAA series ) require more than one satellite in orbit for an operational set . Extras which get replaced on-orbit are powered into a `` standby '' mode for use in an emergency . In that case , however , the same ops team is still required to fly the operational birds ; so the standby maintenance is relatively cheap . Finally , Pat 's explanation ( some spacecraft require continuous maintenance to stay under control ) is also right on the mark . I suggested a spin- stabilized control mode because it would require little power or maintenance , but it still might require some momentum dumping from time to time . In the end , it *is* a political decision ( since the difference is money ) , but there is some technical rationale behind the decision . David W. @ GSFC

The government provides free health care to all U.S. > residents . And there are no out-of-pocket costs . Wrong . In better EC countries that use pure ( but public ) health insurance ( like we use in Canada ) rather than self-enclosed HMO-like socialized medicine , 30 % of our costs comes from private supplementary insurance and/or copayments . France Magazine 's Summer 1992 edition has a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance coverage , including a sample chart of copayment percentages . For 1-30 days , you 're covered for 80 % of the public hospital rate , 100 % afterward . With extra private insurance , you can get into a private hospital and be covered for any differences beyond the public hospital rate . The public insurance covers 100 % beyond 30 days , or the same cash amount for a private hospital and the difference is paid out-of-pocket or according to your supplementary private insurance . Over 2/3rds of French have some form of extra private insurance . So , 30 % of health costs in Europe are out of private funds and not gleaned from other taxes . The GDP figures are combined public and private expenditures for total outlay using the same methods that yield the 13-14 % figure for the U.S. That the French had deductibles and copayments in their insurance fund is to their credit ... I am in the minority for advocating such back in Canada ( to make the Canadian insurance look more like real health insurance -- which actually it is ) . The new Reform Party , a breakoff of traditionalists from the Conservatives with a mildly `` libertarian '' faction , hold our public health insurance as an untouchable but that just a few people have to be reminded that it 's not free ( the average Canadian/European is more fiscally naive than their American counterparts on issues like these ) . I 'm one of the few people who favour copayments ( forget about leftists , even our conservatives attack me for it on the Canadian newsgroups ) to make it look more like real insurance , 'cos the 100 % insurance payment is hidden ( unlike in France ) and if you did n't know it , you 'd believe it actually is socialized medicine ( American conservatives/libertarians and Canadian leftists are the only ones who seriously call it that ) . Canadians are n't worried about the Americans , who spend 14 % ; we 're worried about the French and Germans who spend 7 % to our 9 % ... so the insurance is looking at things that should n't be paid for out of general funds like physicals for insurance policies , sick notes , electrolysis , etc . The reason that the Canadian health insurance has n't spiralled out of control despite being open and universal is that unlike Americans , there is no urge to spend all of your benefits ' worth , and more if you can ... we 're a different culture . > Like the play or pay model , managed competition leaves in place two > elements of the current health care system that reformers most often > criticize : the private , for-profit insurance industry ; and the > employer-based system of coverage .

'' ) . Sure , HMO/NHS controls costs because you have managers strangling doctors with budget strings . In Canada , we use the public health insurance approach as in France and Germany , with all private doctors and both private and public hospitals . It is all pure insurance without HMO 's . The divisions are different , with the Germans using a couple hundred interlinked '' sickness funds '' over a century old while Canada divides by their provinces ( who run the insurance fund and set local fees with the doctors monopoly ; federal funds cover the fees disbursed . ) With such an open-ended system , it 's no surprise that Canada is # 2 to the U.S. in costs ; all-insurance is the most expensive way to go . The French and Germans use the same approach but have larger populations in more compact geography to improve scales of economy . gld -- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Je me souviens ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Gary L.

Decibels are all *ratios . * The question that remains in any ratio is the reference unit used . Sometimes , this will be a reference power , such as 1 milliwatt ( given a certain circuit impedance which should also be included in the fine print or known , like 50 ohms in an RF circuit of that impedance ) , leading to an accepted notation of dBm . Maybe it might be dBV , disregarding the impedance of the circuit and power developed , using 1 volt as reference *amplitude* ( rather than reference power ) . Or , it might have an arbitrary or omitted reference that is not included in the notation , leading to just plain dB . So . look at it this way -- 'dB ' has an implied reference while notation such as 'dBm ' has an explicit reference . For power : dB = 10*log ( P ( measured ) /P ( reference ) ) For amplitude dB = 20*log ( A ( measured ) /A ( reference ) ) ' B ' is for bel , which is a standard term for a log ratio to the base 10 , named after Alexander Graham Bell . A 'deci ' Bel is 1/10 of a bel . It has nothing to do with the Bell Telephone company except for the common founder 's name . The small 'd'/large ' B ' is per SI notation convention . I do n't know anyone that 's been crucified for messing it up . Common references for audio are : 0 dBm = 1 milliwatt across 600 ohms 0 dBV = 1 volt 0 VU ( a zero on the VU meter ) = +4 dBm ( pro gear line level ) 0 VU = -10dBV ( consumer gear line level ) Often times , a power amp VU meter will be aligned using the rated power of the amp as the 0 dB point . It is all done to whatever reference is reasonable for the application or moment . Note that in a circuit with a given ( and maybe unknown ) linear impedance , if the amplitude goes up so many decibels , the power will also increase the same amount . This proof can be done with the above two identities and ohm 's law . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Dave Medin Phone : ( 205 ) 730-3169 ( w ) SSD -- Networking ( 205 ) 837-1174 ( h ) Intergraph Corp.

Well , my question still has n't been answered : if Spanky was bad enough to release this year , why did he get so much playing time last year ? Yes , I know he was part of a platoon , and that 's why he got more playing time than Slaught , but that does n't answer the question .

Now , I do not condone myself bombing villages , any kind of villages . But you claim these are villages with civilians , and Iraelis claim they are camps filled with terrorists . You claim that israelis shell the villages with the 'hope ' of finding a terrorist or so . If they kill one , fine , if not , too bad , civilians die , right ? I am not so sure . As somebody wrote , Saddam Hussein had no problems using civilians in disgusting manner . And he also claimed 'civilians murdered ' . Let me ask you , is n't there at least a slight chance that you ( not only , and the question is very general , no insult ) are doing a similar type of propaganda in respect to civilians in southern Lebanon ? Now , a lot people who post here consider 'Israeli soil ' kind of Mediteranean sea . How do you define Israeli soil ? From what you say , if you do not clearly recognize the state of Israel , you condone killing israelis anywhere . > Dorin , are you aware that the IDF sent helicopters and gun-boats up the > coast of Lebanon the other day and rocketted a Palestinian refugee north of > Beirut . Perhaps I should ask YOU `` what qualifies a person for murder ? `` : I do not know what was the pupose of the action you describe .

If you ask me those questions , I will have no problem answering ( not with a question , as you did ) : No , NOBODY is qualified candidate for murder , nothing justifies murder . I have the feeling that you may be able yourself to make similar statements , maybe after eliminating all Israelis , jews , ? Am I wrong ? Now tell me , did you also condone Saddam 's scuds on israeli 'soldiers ' in , let's say , Tel Aviv ? From what I understand , a lot of palestineans cheered . What does it show ?

Apart from the storage and search requirements , because the evidence is inadmissible : wiretaps require a warrant . And as soon as one such case comes to light , all previous cases are likely to be discovered , and thrown out . There was an article in the NY Times a few months ago about how many convictions in the state might be invalidated because they relied on pen registers -- and the Court of Appeals ruled that pen registers were equivalent to wiretaps , and hence required warrants under New York law .

From : doyle @ cs.umass.edu ( Jim Doyle ) Subject : UMass Big East hockey underway Organization : CS Dept. , Umass-Amherst Lines : 39 NNTP-Posting-Host : gaia.cs.umass.edu Summary : UMass hires Head Coach for first season since 1979 Keywords : UMass Minutemen Mallen X-Newsreader : TIN [ version 1.1 PL9 ] The mission to revive hockey at UMass is now underway . At the 4 PM Saturday afternoon press conference held at the new Mullins Center Arena - former Boston College Asst . Coach Joe Mallen was awarded the 4 year , $ 85,000/year contract as Head Coach for the UMass Minutemen . Mallen was the third viable pick for the position , right behind Jeff Jackson ( Lake Superior ) and second behind Shawn Walsh ( UMaine ) . Previous offers for the position were rumored to have been offered to the asst . coaches of Brown , RPI and the head coach of the AHL Springfield Indians . UMass hockey was disbanded in 1979 due to financial constraints that had undermined the team 's position over a period of years . In late November of last year , the $ 52 million Mullins Sports Center was opened following its one year construction deadline . The Minutemen are slated to play an independent Div II/Div III schedule this upcoming winter before officially entering Hockey East for the Winter 1994 season . Mallen has yet to comment on player recruitment strategies or potential team candidates for the Minutemen - it is expected that he will leverage off his inside contacts within New England , the Bay State and Europe to draw on competitive , top ice players for the University . UMass has slated 18 hockey scholarships for the upcoming Fall semester ; expect to hear more from me as I hear more from my sources . ... .

I agree with Shai , there are many references to Israeli plans on the Litani river but I have yet to find hard evidence . I had mentioned before that there is a report commissioned by the UN to study the Litani river , it is still in draft form . The Israeli gov't also commissioned a study on the river that was done by Dr. Ben Wolfe . The Litani starts in the Bekaa valley in Lebanon , flows Southward , then West across South Lebanon and discharges into the Mediterranean near the city of Tyre . There are other rivers such as the Hasbani and the Wazzani that start in Lebanese territory than join the Jordan river . The most mentioned plan was one that would divert water from the Litani into these , then the water would flow naturally into the Lac De Houle . BUT there is no evidence of any diversion structure ( which would need to be at least 3 km long ) . The area is mountainous , inaccessible and occupied by Israel so I have not seen any independent reports of the existence of any diversion structure there . Another often mentioned diversion is through deep wells . It is also rumored that Israe has 600 m wells tapping into deep aquifers and drawing water on the Israeli side of the border . If such wells are indeed under use they would be costly to operate ( high energy costs ) and the Lebanese and Israeli gov't should agree on the distribution of water from shared aquifers as part of an overall peace plan and the bilateral negociations on `` regional issues '' . The fact that we have been at war all this time has led to the current state of affairs where withdrawals from such aquifers is completely unregulated .

Why would n't they have `` gone out in the proverbial blaze of glory '' and `` come out shooting '' with an attitude of `` let 's take as many of those dogs as possible with us '' ? Instead , they seemed to have preferred death to whatever they thought was in store for them at the government 's hands . It 's totally immaterial whether they were all crazy , all fanatics , all followers of the antichrist , haters of the government , practicers of weird lifestyles , or whatever ... they must have felt that they were being pressured into renouncing their beliefs , however how strange or lunatic those beliefs might appear to `` you and me '' . There is much precedent for such devotion to cause .

So , > there should be some way for them to get access to those keys > -quickly- , right ? Like , they could have a copy of the database , and > worry about a warrant later ... I perhaps should have been clearer and more concise in my post , but that's what I get from posting at 1 am ... The central point I made is that local/state police agencies attempting to play by the rules and get warrants , legit escrowed keys , etc. , may find themselves at the mercy of bureaucratic inertia and agency infighting at the federal level . I disagree that this would assist civil liberties by hobbling the cowboy cops . It would be a strong incentive , as Vesselin points out , for more police agencies to `` go rogue '' and try to get keys through more efficient ( but less Constitutional ) means . Notice what the release said : Q : Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation encrypted using the device . What would they have to do to decipher the message ? A : They would have to obtain legal authorization , normally a ^^^^^^^^^^ court order , to do the wiretap in the first place . ^^^^^^^^^^^ The clear implication is that there are `` legal '' authorizations other than a court order . Just how leaky are these ? ( And who knows what 's in those 7 pages that authorized the NSA ? ) . There may well arise a black market of sorts _within_ police agencies , in which keys are traded . Furthermore , the police will be in an excellent position to carry out this kind of thing without being caught . They already have a communication infrastructure with secure portions . There are a few laws that I know of , that limit citizens ' rights to access police communications ( or use the information they get ) . It may be very difficult to prove police misuse -- the fact that you have such evidence may itself be evidence that YOU have broken some other law . Throw in private detectives , who have even fewer policy/constitutional restrictions . Also consider mercenaries who 've `` retired '' from intelligence agencies . William Gibson must be loving it . Great story material . Do n't think it 'll happen ? Well , consider e.g . the Michigan State Police , generally a very professional organization , which for years kept `` Red Files '' on thousands of suspected commies , knowing full well it was not consititutional . The standards of evidence were just about zero : people were in the file because they happened to park near a place where , say , a US-China People 's Friendship rally was happening -- the police went around writing down license plate numbers . If you happened to be visiting a friend who lived near the meeting place , well , the state police wound up filing you as a subversive . ( They were eventually found out and a court ruled against carrying on any more such nonsense . I believe thay may have had to destroy the tapes as well . ) Even with well-meaning cops ( and I 'm sure there are many ) , there will be strong pressure to bend the constitutional safeguards . We do n't need to assume corrupt or unbalanced officers -- it will all be in the interest of enforcing sensible laws , saving lives , and protecting property . Compromises will be made by well-meaning officers , facing what ( to them ) will be a moral dilemma . Clipper will make criminals out of cops .

Then create an edge dictionary that allows you to find all of the faces sharing a given edge ( where an edge is two integers representing the two shared vertices ) . Pick an arbitrary face and mark it COUNTER_CLOCKWISE . Using the edge dictionary , orient all surrounding faces based on the orientation of this face .

Using that point , calculate a volume measurement , taking into account the face's orientation . If the volume turns out to be positive , assume the faces are oriented correctly . If it is negative , reverse their orientations ( mark them CLOCKWISE ) . If any faces are still UNKNOWN after this , choose another face and go through the algorithm again . At the end , faces marked CLOCKWISE must have their indices reversed before facet normals are found .

Hmm , here are a couple : 1 ) If the algorithm becomes known , it will be easy to produce pin-compatible non-crippled chips that provide -real- encryption and privacy , because their keys are only in their users ' hands . 2 ) Since SkipJack is a symmetric key cypher , it needs some way to agree on a session key . The released information says that any protocol may be used ( e.g. , DH ) . From a theoretical point of view , this is probably true . However , from a practical point of view , those chips must have some kind of key exchange protocol built-in . What if it is good old RSA ? This will mean that the producer will have to pay lots of bucks to PKP . By keeping the details secret this can be avoided ...

From : dufault @ lftfld.enet.dec.com ( MD ) Subject : seizures ( infantile spasms ) Keywords : seizures epilepsy Reply-To : dufault @ lftfld.enet.dec.com ( MD ) Organization : Digital Equipment Corporation Lines : 32 The reason I 'm posting this article to this newsgroup is to : 1. gather any information about this disorder from anyone who might have recently been *e*ffected by it ( from being associated with it or actually having this disorder ) and 2. help me find out where I can access any medical literature associated with seizures over the internet . Recently , I had a baby boy born with seizures which occured 12-15 hours after birth . He was immediately transferred to a major hospital in Boston and has since been undergoing extensive drug treatment for his condition . This has been a major learning experience for me and my wife not only in learning the medical problems that faced our son but also in dealing with hospitals , procedures ... etc . I do n't want to go into a lot of detail , but his condition was termed quite severe at first then slowly he began to grow and put on weight as a normal baby would . He was put on the standard anti-convulsion drugs and that did not seem to help out . His MRI , EKG , cat-scans are all normal , but the EEG 's show alot of seizure activity . After many metabolic tests , body structure tests , and infection/virus tests the doctors still do not know quite what type of siezures he is having ( although they do have alot of evidence that it is now pointing to infantile spasms ) . This is where we stand right now ... . If anyone knows of any database or newsgroup or as I mentioned up above , any information relating to this disorder I would sure appreciate hearing from you . I am not trying to play doctor here , but only trying to gather information about it . As I know now , these particular types of disorders are still not really well understood by the medical community , and so I'm going to see now ... .if somehow the internet can at least give me alittle insight . Thanks .

My argument is that the sole purpose of the death penalty is to kill people . That is it 's primary ( and I would argue only ) purpose . To continue to kill people by a practice that has almost no utility , especially when you know you will be killing innocents , is unconscionable . At the very least , the existence of the prison system and our transportation system are based on their merits to society , not their detriments . We are willing to accept a few lost innocent lives because there is an overwhelming benefit to the continued existence of these systems . One has to stretch the evidence and the arguments to make the same claim for capital punishment . Just in case I was n't clear again : We maintain a capital punsihment system that kills innocent people and provides us with no net positive gain . Why ? Were you to pin me in a corner and ask , I would have to respond that I do n't belief the state should have the right to take life at all .

From : eder @ hsvaic.boeing.com ( Dani Eder ) Subject : Re : Guns for Space Keywords : Sopa Gun , Space Launcer Organization : Boeing AI Center , Huntsville , AL Lines : 22 In reference to the limits of acceleration with guns launching solid rockets as payloads . Thiokol provided me with samples and data on a reinforcement to solid motor grains for high accelerations . Solid motor propellants usually have a substantial percentage of aluminum in the mix . For example , the Space Shuttle SRBs are 16 percent Aluminum . The technique is to use a 'foamed aluminum ' structure . The structure looks like the inverse of a set of bubbles ( an I suspect some bubbling process is used to form it ) . In other words , if you made a bunch of bubbles in molten aluminum , then froze it , this is what you get . It forms a strong network of effectively aluminum wires in all directions . The remaining solid fuel mix is infiltrated into the voids , and you get aluminum-reinforced solid propellant . The foamed-aluminum makes up about 6 percent of the total propellant , so there is still aluminum particles in the bulk grain . The major improvement is the higher resistance to grain cracking , which is the principal failure mode for solid propellant .

My poor old physics intuition will be very surprised if these tiny masses , sitting very close to Jupiter , play any role whatsoever in the problem . Or , to put it more technically , the extra `` volume '' they add to the phase space of possible capture trajectories is negligible . Jupiter is 2E27 kg , while the Galilean satellites are around 1E23 . Also , as I said , the few references that I 've looked at do not mention outgassing or breakup as important processes . The important thing is a Jupiter-Sun-comet `` reverse slingshot '' that leads to a weakly Jupiter-bound orbit for the comet ( at least a temporary one ) .

Apparently land-based > beacons tranmit GPS correction information to your GPS > receiver ( with differential option installed ) . > How does this system work ? What frequency is used for > the land-based beacons ? > Thanks in advance , > Charlie Thompson > . Here 's a rough sketch of how the system works . A reference station with a very exactly known position computes the errors in the incoming GPS signals . These errors are due to several factors including atmospheric distortion , SA ( Selective Availability ) time dithering , etc . The reference unit contains complex computational equipment to `` back out '' the errors in its position ( since it knows where it is already ) . It then transmits these corrections on a broadcast which is available to any number of relatively local receivers . If the receivers are nearby ( < 300km ) and are using the same satellites as the reference unit , the errors should be very similar for the reference unit and the receiver unit . Thus , the receiver unit may apply the corrections calculated by the reference unit . The US Coast Guard is currently ( as far as I know ) installing a series of coastline transmitters for differential GPS . These stations will use existing radio towers . I believe the frequency is to be approximately 305 kHz . There are many other private corporations offering DGPS signals on different frequencies . For example , PinPoint ( ( 310 ) -618-7076 ) offers correction signals and receiver units using an FM broadcast system which has stations all across the US . The correction codes are usually transmitted using the RTCM 104 format . Advertised accuracies espouse 1 to 5 meter errors . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - John P.

There 's quite a difference between Hollywood 's `` Old West '' and the real one . Yes , there were drunks , saloons , mining camps , and thugs . However , as McGrath showed , the thugs preyed almost exclusively on one another . McGrath claims that this was due to the fact that no one much cared if someone who insisted on getting into a fight got his way , even if he lost , while they really did care when thugs preyed on others . > citizens should be able to own weapons , but we see no sense in some > types . We have n't figured out that those distinctions do n't actually work . Machine guns have been strictly regulated since 1934 .

Everyone , Since some people quickly solved the problem of determining a sphere from 4 points , I suddenly recalled a problem which is how to find the ellipse from its offset . For example , given 5 points on the offset , can you find the original ellipse analytically ? I spent two months solving this problem by using analytical method last year , but I failed . Under the pressure , I had to use other method - nonlinear programming technique to deal with this problem approximately . Any ideas will be greatly appreciated . Please post here , let the others share our interests . Yeh USC

Organization : AI Programs , University of Georgia , Athens Lines : 39 To recapitulate a bit : - The essence of marriage is two people 's commitment to each other . - If two people claim to be married `` in their hearts '' but are not willing to have the marriage recognized by church and state , that's prima facie evidence that the commitment is n't really there . - There are obvious situations in which Christian marriage is possible without a civil or church wedding : if you 're stranded on a desert island , or if your state forbids the marriage for an unjust reason ( e.g. , laws against interracial marriage ) . - The legal concept of `` common-law marriage '' is meant to ensure that the state will recognize marriages that did not start out with the usual ceremony and record-keeping . - Pastorally , I 'm concerned that people should not use `` being married in God 's eyes '' as an excuse for living together without a formal wedding . One has a duty to have one 's marriage properly recorded and witnessed . - But there are also people who have been through a wedding ceremony without making a genuine commitment , and therefore are not married in God 's eyes .

My current setup is a 386SX-25 ( AMD ) with 387SX-25 ( ITT - I think ) and 9 Mbytes of 70ns SIMMS , and ( 120+100 ) Mbyte IDE . Basically I have two choices 1 ) Get a 386DX-40 + 387DX-40 or 2 ) Get some sort of 486 . Unfortunately I live in the UK where computer prices are far too high . The first option works out at about \pounds 200 . 486 m/boards start at this price for a SX-25 . I have a couple of questions . 1 ) How much of an improvement in speed should I notice if I get a 386DX+copro . Remember I 'm using a 32 bit OS , and alot of Floating Point operations . 2 ) How much faster would a 486DX-33 be than the 386DX-40+copro ? Should I get an upgradeable m/board with a 386DX-40 and wait for AMD/Pentium price pressure to reduce the costs of the 486 ? Any experiences will be most helpful ... Kenny . PS . Example prices : 386DX-40+copro M/board ~ $ 270 486DX33 M/board ~ $ 580 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Kenneth MacDonald E-mail kenny @ castle.ed.ac.uk Dept . of Geology & Geophysics University of Edinburgh Scotland -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -

Perhaps they were `` strong in the faith ? '' -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - [ No , I do n't believe that Paul can overrule God . However Paul was writing for a largely Gentile audience . The Law was regarded by Jews at the time ( and now ) as binding on Jews , but not on Gentiles . There are rules that were binding on all human beings ( the so-called Noachic laws ) , but they are quite minimal . The issue that the Church had to face after Jesus ' death was what to do about Gentiles who wanted to follow Christ . The decision not to impose the Law on them did n't say that the Law was abolished . It simply acknowledged that fact that it did n't apply to Gentiles . Thus there is no contradiction with Mat 5 . As far as I can tell , both Paul and other Jewish Christians did continue to participate in Jewish worship on the Sabbath . Thus they continued to obey the Law . The issue was ( and is ) with Gentile Christians , who are not covered by the Law ( or at least not by the ceremonial aspects of it ) . Jesus dealt mostly with Jews . I think we can reasonably assume that Mat 5 was directed to a Jewish audience . He did interact with Gentiles a few times ( e.g . the centurion whose slave was healed and a couple of others ) . The terms used to describe the centurion ( see Luke 7 ) suggest that he was a `` God-fearer '' , i.e . a Gentile who followed God , but had not adopted the whole Jewish Law . He was commended by Jewish elders as a worthy person , and Jesus accepted him as such . This seems to me to indicate that Jesus accepted the prevailing view that Gentiles need not accept the Law . However there 's more involved if you want to compare Jesus and Paul on the Law . In order to get a full picture of the role of the Law , we have to come to grips with Paul 's apparent rejection of the Law , and how that relates to Jesus ' commendation of the Law . At least as I read Paul , he says that the Law serves a purpose that has been in a certain sense superceded . Again , this issue is n't one of the abolition of the Law . In the middle of his discussion , Paul notes that he might be understood this way , and assures us that that 's not what he intends to say . Rather , he sees the Law as primarily being present to convict people of their sinfulness . But ultimately it 's an impossible standard , and one that has been superceded by Christ . Paul 's comments are not the world 's clearest here , and not everyone agrees with my reading . But the interesting thing to notice is that even this radical position does not entail an abolition of the Law . It still remains as an uncompromising standard , from which not an iota or dot may be removed . For its purpose of convicting of sin , it's important that it not be relaxed . However for Christians , it 's not the end -- ultimately we live in faith , not Law . While the theoretical categories they use are rather different , in the end I think Jesus and Paul come to a rather similar conclusion . The quoted passage from Mat 5 should be taken in the context of the rest of the Sermon on the Mount , where Jesus shows us how he interprets the Law . The `` not an iota or dot '' would suggest a rather literal reading , but in fact that 's not Jesus ' approach . Jesus ' interpretations emphasize the intent of the Law , and stay away from the ceremonial details . Indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitude towards the Sabbath and kosher laws . Some scholars claim that Mat 5:17-20 needs to be taken in the context of 1st Cent . Jewish discussions . Jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving a tenth of even the most minor herbs , but neglecting the things that really matter : justice , mercy and faith , and caring about how cups and plates are cleaned , but not about the fact that inside the people who use them are full of extortion and rapacity . ( Mat 23:23-25 ) This , and the discussion later in Mat 5 , suggest that Jesus has a very specific view of the Law in mind , and that when he talks about maintaining the Law in its full strength , he is thinking of these aspects of it . Paul 's conclusion is similar . While he talks about the Law being superceded , all of the specific examples he gives involve the '' ceremonial law '' , such as circumcision and the Sabbath . He is quite concerned about maintaining moral standards . The net result of this is that when Paul talks about the Law being superceded , and Jesus talks about the Law being maintained , I believe they are talking about different aspects of the Law . Paul is embroiled in arguments about circumcision . As is natural in letters responding to specific situations , he 's looking at the aspect of the Law that is currently causing trouble : the Law as specifically Jewish ceremonies . He certainly does not intend to abolish divine standards of conduct . On the other hand , when Jesus commends the Law , he seems to be talking the Law in its broadest implications for morals and human relationships , and deemphasizing those aspects that were later to give Paul so much trouble . It 's unfortunate that people use the same terms in different ways , but we should be familiar with that from current conflicts . Look at the way terms like `` family values '' take on special meaning from the current context . Imagine some poor historian of the future trying to figure out why `` family values '' should be used as a code word for opposition to homosexuality in one specific period in the U.S . I think Law had taken on a similar role in the arguments Paul was involved in . Paul was clearly not rejecting all of the Jewish values that go along with the term `` Law '' , any more than people who concerned about the `` family values '' movement are really opposed to family values . -- clh ]

Christianity is an infectious cult .

'' For all of you `` found jeezus '' , how many of you were `` on the brink ? '' but i digress ... The other reason christianity flourishes is its infectious nature . A best friend of mine breifly entered a christian group and within months , they set ministry guidelines for him which basicaly said this -- > Priority # 1 Spread the Word . We are _just_ animals .

Christians inject themselves with jeezus and live with that high . It pities me how many millions of lives have been lost in religious wars , of which Christianity has had no small part . When Christians see a `` non-believer '' , they say that person is blind to the truth , but they can not realize that it is _they_ who live with this mask of fakeness each day . Jesus was just prophet # 37696 who happened to have a large influence because at that time the Romans were ( circa 69ad ) dispersing the Jewish population and communities needed some sort of cohesive element to keep them strong in that time of dire need .

The danger in philosophizing about science is that theory and generalization can end up being far removed from the actual day-to-day of the grunt at the bench . Yes , its great to be involved in a process were I can walk into the lab after a heavy night of dreaming and just do something for the hell of it ( as long as my advisor does n't catch me - which is easy enough to do ) , but stamping out such behavior seems to be the purpose in life of grant review committees and the peer review process in general . In today 's world that 's what determines what science is : what gets funded . And a damn good thing to . Flights of fantasy just do n't have much chance of producing anything , at least not in biomedical research . The surest way for a graduate student to ruin their life is to work in a lab where the boss is more concerned with fleshing out his/her fantasies than with having the student work on a project that actually has a good chance of producing some results . MD 's seem to be particularly prone to this aberrant behavior . > ( Simple example : Warren Jelinek noticed an extremely heavy band on a DNA > electrophoresis gel of human ALU fragments .

If the gospels are the least bit accurate , then there can be little doubt that Jesus belived hell was a reality . As a teacher , what would be the wise and loving thing to do if people in your audience were headed there ? To warn them ! It would , however , be rather cruel and/or sadistic to believe that such a place exists and then remain quiet about it . The only scenario I can envision in which dimished respect would be justified is if Jesus knew there was no such place as hell , and spoke about it anyway , just to scare people .

I was raised as a Unitarian and have spent the better part of my life as an agnostic , but recently I have developed the firm conviction that the Christian message is correct and I have accepted Jesus into my life . I am happy , but I realize I am very ignorant about much of the Bible and quite possibly about what Christians should hold as true . This I am trying to rectify ( by reading the Bible of course ) , but it would be helpful to also read a good interpretation/commentary on the Bible or other relevant aspects of the Christian faith . One of my questions I would like to ask is - Can anyone recommend a good reading list of theological works intended for a lay person ? I have another question I would like to ask . I am not yet affiliated with any one congregation . Aside from matters of taste , what criteria should one use in choosing a church ? I do n't really know the difference between the various Protestant denominations . Thanks for reading my post . Sincerely , Steve Hoskins [ Aside from a commentary , you might also want to consider an introduction . These are books intended for use in undergraduate Bible courses . They give historical background , discussion of literary styles , etc . And generally they have good bibligraphies for further reading . I typically recommend Kee , Froehlich and Young 's NT introduction . There are also some good one-volume commentaries . They often have background articles that are helpful . Probably the best recommendation these days would be Harper 's Bible Commentary . ( I think there may be a couple of books with this title . This is a fairly recent one , like about 1990 , done in cooperation with the Society for Biblical Criticism . ) If you are committed to inerrancy , you will probably prefer something more conservative . I do n't read a lot of conservative books , but a commentary I looked at by Donald Guthrie looked rather good . He has a NT Introduction , and he 's also editor of Eerdman 's Bible Commentary . -- clh ]

I disagree . The system is not too slow , it was simply designed to handle less than it has demanded that it handle . As somebody in Washington put it ( whose name I forget ) , `` Congress has become everybody 's city council . '' Congress is more than capable of quick action , and has more than enough power and time on its hands , if it confined itself to what its original jurisidiction was and allowed more local autonomy . It is not a case of the system of government they created failing , but that it is operating under a set of conditions they specifically wanted to avoid . Namely , a concentration of power . It would seem then that the proper thing to do is not to reduce the power of either House in some attempt to grease the wheels . All you 'll get then is a system which moves quicker to do stupid things . It would make more sense to make more decisions at a local level . > | > On what basis do you suggest that the Senate was supposed to be > | > some sort of rubber-stamp for the House ?

I fail to see where any restrictions , implied or otherwise , were placed on the veto . It could just as easily have been read as a means to put a check on democratically popular but unwise ( in the executive's opinion ) policies . There is no limit in the Constitution to the President 's veto power regarding what a bill is for . Previous Presidents have used the veto for any number of reasons , most usually having something to do with their agenda . I am really curious how you single Bush out as *the* President who abused vetos . > the Senate is not meant to be exactly a rubber stamp body , it is meant as > a check on unrestrained legislation . That is the extra measure built into > the constitution in favour of the status quo , 60 % of the representatives > of the states is not a reasonable restriction . Why is it not a reasonable restriction ? Because 51 Senators is the magic holy number upon which Laws must be based ? If 41 Senators feel safe enough with their state constituencies to stand up and fillibuster is n't that *enough* to indicate there 's a sufficient question as to whether a law is a good idea or not to re-evaluate it ? Why one earth *should* 51 % be sufficient to enact a law which covers 250 million people in very , very diverse places and living in radically different conditions ? Why *shouldn't* a super-majority be required ? Any system in which the simple majority is given absolute power to ignore the minority then the minority *will* be ignored . I do not see this as a positive thing . And for all that I 'm sure the Republicans are looking for pork as much as the Democrats , they 've got some legitimate objections to the legislation in question . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- David Veal Univ . of Tenn.

We are neither in x-Soviet Union , nor in some similar ultra-nationalist fascist dictatorship , that employs the dictates of Hitler to quell domestic unrest . Also , feel free to distribute all responses to your nearest ASALA/SDPA/ARF terrorists , the Armenian pseudo-scholars , or to those affiliated with the Armenian criminal organizations .

Each time a member of the one family kills a member of the other , the other family thinks that it is justified in killing a that member of the first family . Now , let 's suppose that this sequence has occurred an infinite number of times . Or , if you don't like dealing with infinities , suppose that one member of the family goes back into time and essentially begins the whole thing . That is , there is a never-ending loop of slayings based on some non-existent travesty . How do you resolve this ? Well , they are all murders . Now , I suppose that this is n't totally applicable to your `` problem , '' but it still is possible to reduce an uninduced system . And , in any case , the nested `` murderer '' in the definition of murder can not be infintely recursive , given the finite existence of humanity . And , a murder can not be committed without a killing involved . So , the first person to intentionally cause someone to get killed is necessarily a murderer . Is this enough of an induction to solve the apparently unreducable definition ? See , in a totally objective system where all the information is available , such a nested definition is n't really a problem . keith

My impression -- it 's not an area I 've played with much -- is that the much-beloved NE567 is basically obsolete . If you want to detect a 1kHz tone , set a switched-capacitor filter chip to that frequency , feed your input to it , and see if anything comes out the other end .

There have been times in the spiritual # and intellectual evolution of the modern human when these physical # descriptions of Heaven , Hell , and Satan were taken quite literally # and that *worked* for the time .

But what else can you do ? This is why I asked the above . How would you then know God exists as a spirit or being rather than just being metaphorical ? I mean , it 's okay to say `` well , Satan is just metaphorical , '' but then you have to justify this belief AND justify that God is not some metaphor for something else . I say this because there are many , many instances of Satan described as a being ( such as the tormentor in the Old Testament book of Job , or the temptor in the New Testament Gospels ) . In the same way , God too is described as a being ( or spirit . ) How am I to know one is metaphorical and not the other . Further , belief in God is n't a bar to evil . Let's consider the case of Satanists : even if Satan were metaphorical , the Satanist would have to believe in God to justify this belief . Again , we have a case where someone does believe in God , but by religious standards , they are `` evil . '' If Bobby does see this , let him address this question also .

From : Wales.Larrison @ ofa123.fidonet.org Subject : Space Advertising ( 2 of 2 ) X-Sender : newtout 0.08 Feb 23 1993 Lines : 82 Two developments have brought these type of activities back to the forefront in 1993 . First , in February , the Russians deployed a 20-m reflector from a Progress vehicle after it had departed from the Mir Space Station . While this `` Banner '' reflector was blank , NPO Energia was very active in reporting that future Banner reflectors will be available to advertisers , who could use a space- based video of their logo or ad printed on the Banner in a TV commercial , as filmed from the Mir . The second development , has been that Space Marketing Inc , the same company responsible for merchandising space on the Conestoga booster and COMET spacecraft , is now pushing the `` Environmental Billboard '' . As laid out by SMI Chief Engineer Dr Ron Humble of the University of Colorado Space Laboratory and Preston Carter of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory , the `` Environmental Billboard '' is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to 804x1609 meters . Advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area , deployed by the inflatable 'frame ' . To help sell the concept , the spacecraft responsible for maintaining the billboard on orbit will carry `` ozone reading sensors '' to `` continuously monitor the condition of the Earth's delicate protective ozone layer , '' according to Mike Lawson , head of SMI . Furthermore , the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum exposure of 30 days it will be released to re-enter the Earth's atmosphere . According to IMI , `` as the biodegradable material burns , it will release ozone-building components that will literally replenish the ozone layer . '' The remaining spacecraft will monitor the atmosphere for another year before it , too , re-enters and burns up and `` adds to the ozone supply . '' This would not be a cheap advertisement , costing at least several millions of dollars ( exact costs were not available ) . But SMI estimates that market exposure would be 3-5X that of the people who watched the SuperBowl , where a 30-second advertising 'unit ' cost $ 600,000 . Since SMI is located in Atlanta , Georgia , it is being promoted as being available in time for the opening of the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta . But back to Brian 's questions : > And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN > news blip ? How serious is this project ? Is this just in the `` wild > idea '' stage or does it have real funding ? See above . As for serious -- if they can get $ 15-20 M or so ( my estimate of $ 5-10 for development costs and a flight unit , plus $ 10-15 M for a launch ) , then it 's probably real . They are claiming to tailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times for optimum advertising impact so they probably ca n't piggy back upon someone else 's planned launch and will have to buy a dedicated launch . That 's a $ 10-15 M cost they need to raise , right there . And there will probably be some legal challenges to this as well . Note there is one potential legal challenge to SMI on the use of launch vehicle advertising already . While I do n't think the legal challenges would win out ( and yes , I am an amateur astronomer , and no , I do n't really like the idea of this additional light pollution , but I know of no prohibition of it ... ) , the legal challenges and court fights would probably remove any positive aspects of the advertising . I can imagine several ways to make the advertisers look like louts for doing this -- which would change positive market exposure to negative market exposure , and negate the space advertising advantage . ( Would you spend $ 15 M to look like an idiot ? ) ( And light pollution might not be too bad -- if it 's in a low enough orbit , and it relies upon reflected light only , it would only be visible for a short time just after local dusk and before dawn . For maximum market exposure , you want to have it visible just after dusk -- minimizing impact on astronomy , since that 's the time of worse seeing due to day/night thermal turbulence . It might still be a problem , but perhaps there are ways to mitigate this ... ) As for having real funding -- none that I can identify . There were about 60 expressions of interest made on the Conestoga advertising opportunity , but that included curious folks and was for only a $ 500,000 commitment . I have n't heard of any serious funding for this , but I 'm sure they are shopping the venture around looking for some money in order to flesh out the concept some more . But I am confident there are no firm or paying customers at this time . And if anybody wants to cross-post this to sci.astro , please be my guest . I do n't have posting privileges to that area ( or at least I do n't THINK I do ... ) . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Wales Larrison Space Technology Investor -- - Maximus 2.01wb

The users key K which can be derived from RSA , Diffy-Hellman , etc . is used to encrypt plaintext M and is then used to form a `` three part message '' . This three part message consists of E [ M ; K ] , K encrypted with some other key , and the chip serial number . This three part message is then encrypted by still another key . My question is : What is a message ? For example , say we are dealing with an encrypted digitized voice application . The speech waveform is sampled and digitized and then some number of samples are grouped into a 64 bit block . This block is then encrypted and transmitted over a non-secure communications link . Where is the three part message ? Is something appended to each 64 bit block ? Is a header sent at the beginning of the session ? If the header is sent at the beginning of the session , how do they insure the equipment manufacturer using the chip does just that ? Can just anyone manufacture products using the chip ? Is a facility clearance required to manufacture ? Any ideas ?

It would seem more logical to say that since the heterosexual group of men is larger then the chances of promiscuity larger as well . In my opinion , orientation has nothing to do with it . Men are men and they all like sex . I am a gay male . I have had sex three times in my life , all with the same man . Before that , I was a virgin . So ... whose promiscuous ? Just because someone is gay does n't mean they have no morals . Just because someone is heterosexual does n't mean they do . Look at the world ... .

Very possibly , but if it 's still going to be backwards compatible with the ISA bus , it 's going to be the same tripe that the current EISA implementation really is .

I do n't see why people expect Boston to finish sixth . The bottom four teams last year were essentially tied . Boston , in seventh place , had 73 wins . The Yankees and Indians , tied for fourth place , had 76 wins . Now I should think it is obvious that the Red Sox improved more than the Indians or Tigers . Basically , the Red Sox are stronger this year at 1B , DH , SS , LF , and RF . They have healthier starting pitchers ( so far , at least ) and better relievers . I see no reason why they should n't win ~85 games . Meanwhile , the Indians are in shambles and the Tigers *still* have no pitching . They will win some 20-3 blowouts , but they will lose an awful lot of 7-5 games too . *MAYBE* the Sox will play poorly , win 78 games , and finish fifth . But I think third or fourth place is more likely . Cheers , -Valentine

Actually detecting a BREAK is done by watching for a `` character '' containing all zero bits with the framing error resulting from its receipt . This means that the line stayed in the zero bit state even past the stop bit time slot , which basically indicates a BREAK . There is no special way to detect BREAK that I have found other than this -- there 's no magic signal generated by UARTs , etc .

From the description of ad here , it sounds like they 're talking about '' High Power Rocketry '' , an outgrowth of model rocketry . This hobby uses non-metallic structural compoments and commerically manufactured engines ranging in impulse classification from G to P. The hobby has been flourishing from early 1980s and is becoming increasing popular . Technically this is not consider amateur rocketry . Any rocket with a liftoff weight greater than 3.3 pounds OR using a total impulse of G or greater , REQUIRES an FAA waiver to launch . Typically , a group of people get an FAA waiver for specified period of time ( ie week , weekend , etc . ) at a designated site and time , and all of the launches are then covered under this `` blanket waiver '' . There is also a `` High Power Safety Code '' which designates more specific rules such as launch field size , etc . Finally , in order to purchase any of the larger ( Class B ) rocket motors you need to certified through either the National Association of Rocketry or Tripoli Rocketry Association . Certification procedures require a demonstarted handling and `` safe '' flight at a total impulse level . For more information , watch rec.models.rockets newsgroup . R.

If this is grounded firmly in Islam , as you claim , then you have just exposed Islam as the grounds for terrorism , plain and simple . Whether you like it or not , whether Rushdie acted like a total jerk or not , there is no acceptable civilized basis for putting someone in fear of their life for words . It simply does not matter whether his underlying motive was to find the worst possible way he could to insult Muslims and their beliefs , got that ? You do not threaten the life of someone for words - when you do , you quite simply admit the backruptcy of your position . If you support threatening the life of someone for words , you are not yet civilized . This is exactly where I , and many of the people I know , have to depart from respecting the religions of others . When those beliefs allow and encourage ( by interpretation ) the killing of non-physical opposition . You , or I or anyone , are more than privledged to believe that someone , whether it be Rushdie or Bush or Hussien or whover , is beyond the pale of civilized society and you can condemn his/her soul , refuse to allow any members of your association to interact with him/her , _peacably_ demonstrate to try to convince others to disassociate themselves from the `` miscreants '' , or whatever , short of physical force .

Dear Tim : You say that you were a `` catholic , '' but if you do not believe in the Christian God ( I suppose that means the God of the Bible ) and publicly state this , you are in all probability not a Roman Catholic . `` Public heretics , even those who err in good faith ( material heretics ) , do not belong to the body of the Church '' ( Fundamentals of Catholic Dogma , 1960 , Ludwig Ott , p. 311 ) . All is not lost , however , as you still might belong spiritually to the Church by your desire to belong to it . As you said , only God can judge the condition of a man 's soul . About judgment , on the other hand , St. Paul 1 Cor 5:12 ) urges Christians to judge their fellow Christians . Following the Apostle 's teaching , I judge that you should reconsider returning to the Christian fold and embrace the God of Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob . He is the God who lives . Concerning what you were told about non-believers when you were a catholic , that is true . As I have posted before , Vatican II ( Lumen Gentium , II , n. 16 ) teaches : `` Those who , through no fault of their own , do not know the Gospel of Christ or His Chruch , but who nevertheless seek God with a sincere heart , and moved by grace , try in their actions to do His will as they know it through the dictates of their conscience - those too may achieve eternal salvation . '' Responding to your solicitation for opinions on the thinking processes of God , the best I can do is refer you to Scripture . Scripture is one of the best sources for learning what can be known about God .

Outbreaks of a chronic-mono-like entity were originally called EBS ( or some variant thereof ) because most of the people with this disease had elevated levels of antibodies to the EBV virus . But not all of them did , which prompted an official renaming of the disease to Chronic Fatigue Syndrome ( this renaming took place in the Annals of Internal Medicine , Jan. 1988 , I believe ) . Now it 's also called Chronic Fatigue and Immune Dysfunction Syndrome ( CFIDS ) , since it seems clear that some sort of immune disregulation is causing the probs . Astonishly , there are still docs who tell people with massively swollen glands , recurrent fevers and nightsweats , etc. , that there's nothing wrong with them . This is not the same thing as saying that the syndrome may have a ( at least partly ) psychological cause . The disagreement among people whose thoughts are worth considering centers on just what the cause is . No one knows , but theories include : psychological stress , some sort of virus ( a retrovirus , say most -- maybe one of the newly discovered herpes viruses ) , environmental toxins , bacteria ( and , yes , candida ) , genes , ( and/ ) or some combo of these . There 's no outright cure at the moment , but different docs try different things , some of which seem to help . Massive amounts of info on the condition are available these days . Post your Q to alt.med.cfs , and you will be flooded w/facts . Note : There are lots of far better understood ( and better treatable ) diseases that look like CFIDS . Make sure these get ruled-out by a good doc .

'' Are you saying that the Indians who became Christians did so because the US Army marched them into church at gunpoint ? This will be news to the Indians of the Great Lakes and upper Mississippi basin -- of the Southwest -- of Mexico and South America -- who converted even before there was such a thing as the US .

In the Jewish tradition you are incredibly wrong ! They originate in the Torah and with Jewish ancestors , specifically the Patriarch Abraham ( z '' l ) . That knowledge was sent East to India and China when Abraham gave `` gifts '' ( the commentators to Jewish scripture say this was the knowledge of the occult arts ) to all the rest of his children when he sent them away to the East . This assured that Isaac only , who remained with Abraham , would inherit his most important spiritual gifts , what eventually became Judaism . So you see , other religions can have very parochial views too .

From : Thyagi @ cup.portal.com ( Thyagi Morgoth NagaSiva ) Subject : ZOROASTRIANISM - SAN JOSE - ( Merc News Article ) Organization : The Portal System ( TM ) Distribution : world Lines : 169 ZOROASTRIANISM SAN JOSE , CA , USA Monday April 5 , 1993 San Jose Mercury News , Page 1 [ Reproduced without permission ] _3,700-year tradition still glows - 'Assimilation in U.S. threatens ancient Zoroastrian religion ' _ By Jeanne Huber , Mercury News Staff Writer HIGH ON A HILLSIDE above San Jose , flames leap up 24 hours a day from a gleaming brass urn in a temple - one of only four in the United States - dedicated to one of the world 's most ancient religions . With the flames go the prayers of about 1,200 Bay Area Zoroastrians that their faith will survive this land . `` There is a fear - a real fear , too , '' said Silloo Tarapore of Lafayette . `` We have one generation to do it or to die . '' Many immigrant groups struggle to maintain an identity in a strange land . But for Zoroastrians , it is an especially poignant concern . Their religion has been around for perhaps 3,700 years , a heritage so deep it scarcely seems comprehensible in a state where `` historical sites '' are sometimes less than 100 years old . It was the religion of the great Persian Empire under kings Cyrus and Darius . And tradition says that when Christ was born about 500 years later , he was honored by a visit from three Zoroastrian priests , the Magi . Scholars say many key beliefs of Christians , Jews and Muslims can be traced to the teachings of Zoroaster , the Zoroastrian prophet . Yet , with only about 150,000 Zoroastrians in the entire world , they are a miniscule minority in every country in which they live . Survival as a people is very much on their minds . Ironically , local Zoroastrians fear that the almost unlimited tolerance of the United States may do what hundreds of years of persecution followed by nearly 1,000 years of benign religious segregation could not do : cause their young people to stop thinking of themselves as Zoroastrians . Zoroastrians do not believe theirs is the only right religion , and they actually shun the notion of trying to win converts . So if their children become totally assimilated , they say , it 's their children - rather than the world at large - who will be the losers . `` It 's important to have an identity , '' said Maneck Bhujwaia of San Jose , a leader among Zoroastrians who came here from India . `` It 's important for everybody - Irish , Scottish , Americans . It gives meaning to life . You do n't have to depend on the majority community to give you respect . You can fall back on your own identity . '' For Zoroastrians , there 's much to be proud of . Their prophet , Zoroaster , seeking to make sense of a culture in which animal sacrifice to multiple gods was common , preached that there was only one god , a good one . Zoroastrians call their god Ahura Mazda , which translates as Lord of Wisdom and Light . _Good vs. evil_ Zoroaster saw life as a constant struggle between good and evil , with the good eventually winning . Men and women could join in the battle for good , he said , and he warned that they would inevitably suffer consequences such as shame and sorrow if they did wrong . He preached honesty , charity , kindness to animals , respect for the environment , hard work , equality of men and women - basic virtues preached by prophets of many religions . But Zoroaster was perhaps unusual in that he told his followers not to follow him blindly . He demanded they think for themselves . In fact , Joseph Campbell , the famous scholar of the history and meaning of myths , traced the Western emphasis on individual thought to the Zoroastrians . Zoroastrians have many words for thought . Their motto , leaded into a stained glass window over the sacred fire at the temple on the slopes of Mount Hamilton , is `` Good thoughts , good words , good deeds . '' So it 's not surprising that Zoroastrians value education highly . In India , where a contingent of Zoroastrians arrived in the ninth century to escape persecution by Muslims in Iran , Zoroastrians claim 100 percent literacy ; the overall statistic in India is just 60 percent . About half of the Bay Area Zoroastrian community came here from India and Pakistan , mostly to study at universities . The other half fled from Iran after the 1979 revolution made that a fundamentalist Islamic state where others had no rights . Local Zoroastrians point with pride to ways their emphasis on `` good deeds '' has improved life in every country they inhabit . In San Jose , the recent restoration of the Hotel Sainte Clarie came about because Manou Mobedshahi , a San Francisco-based hotelier , passed the boarded-up downtown landmark on his way to and from the temple . At the temple's dedication , the chief guest of honor was the mother of Zubin Mehta , the Zoroastrian conductor of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra . The temple exists because of another good deed : the decision by an Iranian emigre , the late Arbab Rustom Guiv , to buy land for six temples in North America . Besides the 10-acre site off Crothers Road on Mount Hamilton , he paid for land in Los Angeles , Chicago , New York , Toronto , and Vancouver . Until his gifts , there were no Zoroastrian temples on this continent . Local Zoroastrians raised money to build the actual temple , and the property already had a large house that they have converted to a community center . The temple , dedicated a year ago on the birthday of the prophet Zoroaster , is a simple structure with gleaming white walls , vaulted ceilings and oak floors , partially covered with huge Oriental carpets . Its central feature is the fire , set in the middle of a partly-glassed- in area at the center of the building . Although Zoroastrians are sometimes called `` fire worshippers , '' they actually consider fire just a symbol of God . `` It helps us concentrate , just like Christians use the cross and Muslims use the Holy Book , '' Bhujwala said . The biggest celebration of the years occurs in early spring . For all Iranians , including Zoroastrians , the New Year begins on the first day of the season because of its symbolism as the start of new life . With Zoroaster 's birthday just six days later , the combination of religious and secular holidays creates something on par with what most of the United States celebrates between Christmas and Jan. 1 . For this year 's celebration of the prophet 's birthday , about 500 people came to worship and revel . `` The good things in life are not forbidden , '' Esfandiar Anoushiravani , a leader of the Iranian members , had said beforehand , and what followed proved him right . Inside the temple , worshipers filled every chair and sat or stood around the edges of the room as about a half-dozen priests chanted thanksgiving prayers around a table laden with braziers of smoking sandalwood , glasses of milk and water , and a tray heaped with dried fruit and nuts . Kids crowded around , grabbing handfuls of the treats . `` People eat the fruit , '' Tarapore said . `` It 's a way to participate in the ceremony . '' _Santa Claus , sort of_ The gathering even had a Santa Claus , Iranian style . With flowing white hair and a bag of gifts for the children , this Amownaroz wore green symbolic of spring ) and red . He was ushed in by a sort of spring clown , Hajefyrouz , who danced and played a tambourine . The Zoroastrians from India were charmed . `` This is all new for us , too , '' one told a visitor who asked what was going on . A visitor , John A. Sabanovich of Folsom , said he became intrigued with the religion years ago while on business trips to Iran . Zoroastrians have no procedure for accepting converts - a result , some say , of their centuries of persecution in Iran followed by their promise to the Hindu king who allowed them into India that they would not interfere with his people 's religion . But that does not stop Sabavich from joining in the celebrations at the San Jose temple whenever he can . `` When I first heard about this religion , '' he said , `` I thought , my God , this is what a religion should be . They think for themselves and do good . `` People who do n't have a tradition , something to lean on , what 's the difference with the lower animals ?

I am told ( by the person who I care a lot about and who I am worried is going to start putting his health and money into homeopathy without really knowing what he is getting into and who is the reason I posted in the first place about homeopathy ) that in Britain homeopathy is available on the National Health Service and that there are about 6000 GPs who use homeopathic practices . True ? False ? What ? Have there been any important and documented investigations into homeopathic principles ? I was reading a book on homeopathy over the weekend . I turned to the section on the principles behind homeopathic medicine , and two paragraphs informed me that homeopaths do n't feel obliged to provide any sort of explanation . The author stated this with pride , as though it were some sort of virtue ! Why am I sceptical about homeopathy ? Is it because I am a narrow-minded bigot , or is it because homeopathy really looks more like witch-doctory than anything else ? Daniele .

From : ez005997 @ othello.ucdavis.edu ( Oppy ) Subject : Info . on Genoa 8500 vlb card or other low-end vlb ? Originator : ez005997 @ othello.ucdavis.edu Organization : University of California , Davis Distribution : usa Lines : 16 I am looking for an inexpensive vlb card , and have yet to run across any real reviews of them . One of the cards the local stores are pushing is the Genoa 8500 for $ 125-140 . Apparently it uses a Cirrus Logic acc . chip , but I do n't know which one ( GD5426 ? ) . One of the shops I 've spoken with claims the card out-performs the Diamond Stealth 24 vl and the Orchid Fahrenheit 1280 plus vl cards ( S3 86C805 based ) , but that ca n't be true if it is using the GD5426 . I like the price of the Genoa 8500 , but if it lags in performance behind the S3 cards , I 'll pay the extra $ 50 for one of them . Any info . on low end vlb cards would be appreciated . If I get replies via email , I 'll post summary info . if anyone else is interested . Thanks in advance , Brian Oppy ( bjoppy @ ucdavis.edu )

He himself said why in John 12:23-32 . It > is n't a mystery to anyone and there certainly is no need for > a persuasive argument . Read Jesus 's own reply to your > question . John 12:24-26 : `` Most assuredly , I say to you , unless a grain of wheat falls onto the ground and dies , it remains alone ; but if it dies , it produces much grain . `` He who loves his life will lose it , and he who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life . `` If anyone serves Me , let him follow Me ; and where I am , there My servant will be also . If anyone serves Me , him My Father will honor . '' Why would I want an eternal life if I hate this one ? If we were created by a deity , why would that deity not wish us to enjoy what he has given us ? Why would I want to live forever ? The challenge in my life is that I will die , and that I must give my life the meaning I wish it to have before that happens . My time is here and will someday pass ; I will be content to live on in the memories of my friends , and once they too are dead , then I will no longer have any reason to exist . In short : even if your deity *does* exist , that does n't automatically mean that I would worship it . I am content to live my own life , and fend for myself , so when I die , I can be proud of the fact that no matter where I end up , it will be because of *my* actions and *my* choices . If your god decides to toss me into a flaming pit for this , then so be it . I would much rather just cease to exist . But if your god wants my respect and my obedience , then it had better earn these ; and if it does , then they will be very strong and true . > Jesus gives more reasons in John 16:7 . But one obvious reason > why Jesus died , ( and as with everything else , it has nothing do with > his punishment ) was that he could rise to life again -- so that > we would `` stop doubting and believe '' ( John 21:27 ) . The fact > that Jesus rose from the dead is my hope that I too will rise > from the dead . It is an obvious point . Do not overlook it . > Without this obvious point , I would have no hope > and my faith would be vanity . Jesus was n't the only one who rose from the dead -- I think it was Osiris who did the same , as well as a few characters from Greek or Norse legend , if memory serves . But still : WHY would I want to rise from the dead ? Why do *you* want to ? > Why did Jesus suffer in his death ? Again , ask Jesus . Jesus > says why in John 15:18-25 . That 's no mystery either . `` The > world hates him without reason . '' It is a direct proclamation > of how far we humans botch things up and thus , how much we > need a Saviour . If your god wants to win my devotion , then it knows what it can do -- provide some way for me to believe without having to resort to blind faith that could be applied equally well to any religion . > And why ca n't you , Brian K. , accept this ? How can you ? `` The > world can not accept him because it neither sees him nor knows > him . '' ( John 14:17 ) . That 's precisely it . I neither see nor know Zeus either , nor Odin . Shall I offer them the same devotion I offer Jesus ? > The animosity and the lack of knowledge > that comes out in your twistings of Robert 's daily verses is > very convincing testimony of the truth of John 14:17 and 16:25 . You 've got to understand my point-of-view : I see Christians spouting Bible verse all the time as if it were some sort of magic spell that will level all opposition . Truth is , it 's not . Robert has never demonstrated that he actually understands what the verses imply ; he just rattles them off day by day . Some brazenly fly in the face of common sense and reality , and I point these out where I can . But even more than that , even when Christians *do* try to explain the verses in their own words , they do so from a Christian point of view , which is that every human being would want to be a Christian if only he or she understood the Christian message properly , and then all strife and suffering on the earth would end . Here 's the problem with that : substitute `` Moslem '' or `` Buddhist '' or `` Satanist '' instead of '' Christian '' , and it means the same thing . Christanity is a very nice belief set around a very nice book . But if you want to make me believe that it has any bearing on the REAL WORLD , you 've got some convincing to do . > I pray and hope that I do blurt out such animosity and lack of > knowledge . I am not perfect either . But regardless of that , I thank > God that Jesus revealed himself to me , without whom I 'd also be > bumbling about blindly though arrogantly slandering the very > Person who created me and who loves me . And in my opinion , you 're bumbling about blindly making up entities where there are n't any , and depriving yourself of a true understanding and enjoyment of your life . As long as you keep your beliefs to yourself , I 'll keep my beliefs to myself -- but as soon as you start waving them around , expect me to toss in my opinions , too . -- _/_/_/ Brian Kendig Je ne suis fait comme aucun /_/_/ bskendig @ netcom.com de ceux que j'ai vus ; j'ose croire _/_/ n'etre fait comme aucun de ceux qui existent . / The meaning of life Si je ne vaux pas mieux , au moins je suis autre . / is that it ends . -- Rousseau

Given this comparatively tiny number of wiretaps , and the associated difficulty and cost involved ( judges , technicians , etc ) I expect that law enforcement reserves the use of wiretaps for the most valuable cases . Since the `` value '' of an arrest can vary over an enormous range ( eg . jaywalking - > mass murder ) I think your $ 5 million estimate may be too low by a couple of orders of magnitude .

I find this method much better myself , too , although I do really hate it when the bolt finally comes loose and the wrench and my hand both come crashing into my face . After coming to , which is about 15 minutes later , I change my clothes ( because by this time all the oil has drained *on* me ) , and ice my entire face and suck down about 20 Tylenol to ease the pain . Later in the day I then proceed with refilling the engine oil . It 's just crazy how I try and change the oil on my cars in one weekend -- -I go through about 3 bottles of Tylenol and 2 bags of ice .
