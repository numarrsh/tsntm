But apart from that little | > conundrum ... This is a difficult problem for which there is no obviously good solution . One approach is simply to try and move political opinion and hope a new more libertarian consensus lasts for a while . Another approach is to try and amend the constitution . The original constitution restrained the U.S. government from economic intervention for 100 to 150 years , depending on just how one wants to count it . The First Amendment , though weakened in many ways , still restrains government ( particularly state and local ) , even though on many particular issues the majority is in favor of censorship . I think libertarians would be happy with another 100 years of restraint via an amendment or two ( not that I think that 's likely to happen ) . Not necessarily Mr. Hendricks , but other posters seem to see this as a problem with libertarianism , that it can not be stable . That might be true , but it is not an objection to libertarianism per se . If a libertarian political consensus forms for a decade or two and then falls apart again , we would just be back where we are now . This is unlike the case for socialism where a socialist consensus that held for a while and then fell apart would not leave us where we are now , but instead with lots of bureaucracy that would be hard to get rid of , if not tyranny as the end condition of a strong socialist consensus . -- Ervan Darnell ervan @ cs.rice.edu

I know > that romans talks about how we are saved by our faith not our deeds , yet > hebrews and james say that faith without deeds is useless , saying ' You fools , > do you still think that just believing is enough ? ' Actually I do n't think there is any conflict if we really understand what these passages say . First , what is faith ? If you study the meaning of the Greek and Hebrew words so translated I think you will come to the conclusion that the word means a *lot* more than mere belief . Faith means both trust and action . If you do not put your belief into action it simply can not qualify as faith . I think this is what James means when he says that `` faith without works is dead '' and , `` I will show you my faith by my works . '' Remember James was writing to `` the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad . '' This probably means he was writing to those who would hear the gospel much later and would n't understand the meaning of the original Greek . ( Indeed I suspect James was writing to us , today , among others he intended to reach . ) Paul , on the other hand wrote mostly to the people of the Roman empire who generally understood the meaning of the Greek . Another key to why there is no conflict is to look at Paul's statements in their context . I think you will find that when Paul contrasts faith and works it is in the context of comparing the gospel with the Law , meaning the Law of Moses . This was the great burden of Paul 's life . As the apostle to the Gentiles he would go convert a bunch of people , then the `` Judizers '' would come along and try to convince them that they also had to obey the Law of Moses ( cf Acts chapter 15 ) . In this context Paul condemns the idea of being saved by the works of the Law , saying that we are saved by the blood of Jesus and our faith in him . I believe that a better translation for today would be that we are saved by *faithfulness* . I think '' faithfulness '' today has a meaning closer to what the original writers intended . > Now if someone is fully believing but there life is totally lead by themselves > and not by God , according to Romans that person is still saved by there faith . I think you misunderstand Romans . What Paul is really saying is that God prefers a faithful Gentile who does not `` keep kosher '' to a kosher Jew who fails to stay faithful in the more important matters of following the Lord and having charity toward his fellows . > But then there is the bit which says that God preferes someone who is cold to > him ( i.e . does n't know him - condemned ) so a lukewarm Christian someone who > knows and believes in God but does n't make any attempt to live by the bible . In the sense of faith described above , you can not have real faith and be lukewarm . If you know God but are lukewarm ( unfaithful ) , you are worse off than the person who never heard of Him . Remember , Jesus in the parable of the pearl of great price ( Mat 13:45-46 ) and again in the one on the treasure hidden in the field ( Mat 13:44 ) indicates that the price of the Kingdom of God is *all* we have . [ I agree with you in general , including the fact that `` pistis '' has some of the force of `` faithful '' . However if you take that too far , you can end up with something that Paul definitely would not have intended . Being faithful means following God in all things . To say that we are saved by being faithful is very close to saying that we are saved by commiting no sins . I assume that 's not what you meant . I have almost given up on finding a specific verbal formula that completely captures this . However I think Paul is describing what I'd call a basic orientation , including aspects such as trust and commitment . Jesus speaks of it as rebirth , which implies a basic change . We may still do things that are sinful , and may fail to show the new life in Christ in many situations where we should . But in any Christian there had better be the basic change in orientation that Jesus calls being born again . -- clh ]

The comment about contact lenses not being an option for any remaining correction after RK and possibly after PRK is interresting . Why is this ? Does anyone know for sure whether this applies to PRK as well ? Also , why is it possible to get a correction in PRK with involvement of only about 5 % of the corneal depth , while RK is done to a depth of up to 95 % ? Why such a difference ? I thought the proceedures were simmilar with the exception of a laser being the cutting tool in PRK . I must not be understanding all of the differences . In the FAQ , the vision was considered less clear after the surgery than with glasses alone . If this is completly attributable to the intentional slight undercorrection , then it can be compensated for when necessary with glasses ( or contacts , if they CAN be worn afterall ! ) . It is important to know if that is not the case , however , and some other consequence of the surgery would often interfere with clear vision .

Some involve modifying the physical media , and some involve encryption schemes , & c. All of the ones that have existed over the course of computing have been successful for a time . I recall , however , near monthly releases of new ways to `` crack '' the copy protection scheme of the latest releases . The fact is , none of them are completely secure , or anywhere near it . Some are more or less difficult to crack , and some have already been cracked . I guess what I am saying is that your question is difficult , if not impossible , to answer . What exactly do you want to know ? Do you need a good one for a project you are working on ? How secure must it be ? Are you trying to crack one that someone else has used ? I can probably make suggestions , assuming the activity is strictly legal . ( In general , it is a BAD idea , legally , to tamper with copy protection . It can also lead to corruption of files which you necessarily do not have back ups of ( being as they are copy protected , ) which can be devestating . ) Do you have absolutely no ideas for practical applications , and are merely curious ? Please clear up those questions , and I 'll try to help as much as I can . Incidentally , the `` Uh oh ... '' at the top is indicative of the dread anyone who has watched their friends hacking equipment be carted off feels when they are asked how to hack . The area you are broaching is wrought with dangers , many of which include breaking the law , or at least addressing it ( from one side or the other . ) Matt

How can you justify such discrimination , if this is true ? > Is the mere fact of a person leaving area of combat to seek refuge > somewhere else a reason for stripping him of his right to live in > his homeland ? You are conveniently ommitting the fact that the Arab governments told the Arab citizens of Israel to leave Israel , join with the Arab armies so that after what they felt like an assured victory occured , these Arabs could return to their former homes , reclaim them as well as anything else they wanted that belonged to Jews . When the Arabs lost , Israel was left with a bunch of people who has just tried to kill them who now wanted back into the country as citizens . What would you have done ? Let them in so they could kill Jews ? Israel sees those Arabs who stayed as citizens because they were loyal to Israel during the war and did n't leave . Of course some Arabs could have left to avoid the fighting but distinguishing between the two is impossible . Therefore a decision was made based on secuturity of the country . > 8 .

No kibbutz that I have ever visited has any `` employees '' unless they had to hire some people for the restaurants , hotels etc if there were n't enough people ON the kibbutz to do them . In such cases , they are paid properly .

But Israel has always been ruled by a > secular majority . Your answer is not satisfactory . This just shows how ignorant you are of Israeli politics . Although the major parties in Israel are n't religious ( however not totally secular ) , due to the format of the government ( coalition ) the religious parties have always had a lot of pull since they were needed to form a majority coalition . In fact , from what I heard the present government is the least influenced by the religious parties in the existance of Israel . Israel CAN NOT be called a secular state . For instace , Haifa is the only city in the country ( except for maybe some Arab cities ) where buses run on the Jewish Sabbath . There are many other examples of religion in Israel . Marriages in Israel are NOT contolled by the state , but by Rabbis and Priests . Obviously your disbelief of this fact sheds some light of your ignorance of the country you claim to know so much about .

From : davewood @ bruno.cs.colorado.edu ( David Rex Wood ) Subject : Calling a library which creates widgets ( multiple times ) Nntp-Posting-Host : bruno.cs.colorado.edu Organization : University of Colorado , Boulder Lines : 91 A few days ago I posted a question about trying to call a function which set up an X app multiple times . It was pointed out that XtAppInitialize ( ) should never be called more than once . This helped . However , I am still having some problems . Below is a new little test program that more closely models my real program . In the actual program , I am writing a library , callable from any other program . This means that the first time the lib function is called , it must initialize things , and after that , it should just use the old stuff ( still around because of static variables ) . In the demo below , main ( ) represents the main program calling my library and doit ( ) represents the interface to the library function . # include < X11/Xlib.h > # include < Xm/Xm.h > # include < Xm/PushB.h > # include < stdio.h > # include < stdlib.h > void bla ( XtAppContext app , Widget top ) { Widget topone = top ; // in real prog , these are member vars XtAppContext theapp = app ; // of a class int junk = 0 ; Display *dis = XtOpenDisplay ( theapp , NULL , NULL , NULL , NULL , 0 , & junk , NULL ) ; Widget box = XtVaCreateManagedWidget ( `` blaaa '' , xmPushButtonWidgetClass , topone , XmNheight , 50 , XmNwidth , 50 , NULL ) ; XtRealizeWidget ( topone ) ; for ( int i=0 ; i < =25 ; i++ ) // real prog returns when `` Exit '' button clicked { XEvent event ; XtAppNextEvent ( theapp , & event ) ; XtDispatchEvent ( & event ) ; } XtDestroyWidget ( box ) ; XtCloseDisplay ( dis ) ; } // SetItUp - should be called once only void SetItUp ( XtAppContext *app , Widget *top ) { int junk = 0 ; ( *top ) =XtAppInitialize ( app , `` test '' , NULL , 0 , & junk , NULL , NULL , NULL , 0 ) ; } // doit - some library function callable from the outside void doit ( ) { static XtAppContext app ; // use these every time called static Widget top ; static int setup = 0 ; if ( ! setup ) { SetItUp ( & app , & top ) ; setup = 1 ; } bla ( app , top ) ; } // main - program which links to my library main ( ) { for ( int i=0 ; i < =20 ; i++ ) { doit ( ) ; printf ( `` sleeping ... \n '' ) ; //widget still on screen at this point sleep ( 5 ) ; } } The problem is that the widget does not go away until the new one is created .

From : bharper @ cimlinc.uucp ( Brett Harper ) Subject : GUI Application Frameworks for Windows ? ? Organization : CIMLINC , Inc. - Engineering Lines : 63 Hello , I 'm investigating the purchase of an Object Oriented Application Framework . I have come across a few that look good : Zapp 1.1 from Inmark Zinc 3.5 from Zinc software C++/Views from Liant Win++ from Blaise Some considerations I 'm using : Being new to Windows programming ( I 'm from the UNIX/X world ) , the quality and intuitivness of the abstraction that these class libraries provide is very important . However , since I 'm not adverse to learning the internals of Windows programming , the new programming methodology should be closely aligned with the native one . I do n't believe arbitrary levels of abstraction , just for the sake of changing the API , are valuable . Since we will be developing for the 32bit Windows NT system the memory management issues and issues particular to the Windows 3.1 API are less important . We will probably buy another C++ class library ( something like Tools.h++ or Booch components from Rational ) to handle data structures and other miscellaneous stuff ( allocators etc ... ) . So those features are not that important for this toolkit to have . The two that I have narrowed it down to are ZApp and Zinc , they seem to be the two toolkits that have received the most attention from the media . I was wondering if anyone had any first-hand experience with any of these toolkits ( especially ZApp and Zinc ) . A couple of observations about these toolkits that seem particularly noteworthy are : ZApp -- -- Seems to have the most extensive coverage of Windows functionality and also includes some other miscellaneous useful classes . Has new fancy 3D-style controls available , and support for custom controls . Has a Windows NT version ( Essential ) Redirectable graphics display/output architecture ( useful for printing ) Sizer class for automatically managing control layout after resize . Seems to be the newcomer , this could be an advantage in designing a better system . Zinc -- -- Has a platform independent resource strategy . ( Not too important for me right now ) Comes with a interface builder tool Has a Windows NT version ( Essential ) Seems to have been around longer ( more mature ) , but grew up out of a DOS version . Had a better demo : - ) Both have source code availability options Both are lacking OLE support Neither seem to have any particular support for multimedia type stuff Any thoughts anyone has on this would be much appreciated , Thanks , Brett Harper brett.harper @ cimlinc.com

I would just add to Phil 's very infomative discussion the following caveat : the fifth amendment applies ONLY in crinial cases . ( `` ... nor shall any person . . . be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself ... '' ) . Thus if the father sued for custody of the children , the case would be civil and the defendant mother would not have fifth amendment protection . Oddly enough , her refusal to give information in a civil case can lead to criminal contempt charges ( thus landing her in jail . ) The interesting part of all this is that in a murder trial , the woman CAN plead the fifth as to the location of the child -- this is routine . A `` computer crime '' prosecution thus would seem to be fertile ground for this kind of defense , where a suit by a party injured by `` hackers '' would not . If I am accused , for example , of sending encrypted kiddie porn over the nets the fifth should protect my key . If I am accused of sending copyrighted material , however , it proabably will not ( copyright infringement not being a `` crime '' in the technical sense . ) The REALLY tricky question is , say I do both ( naughty boy that I am ) can the government use the information gained in the civil trial ( ie . my key ) to gain access to my files for use in the criminal prosecution .

'' It | > states the 7th day ( Saturday ) is the Sabbath while most Christian religions | > keep ( or atleast go to church ) on Sunday . What 's up ? | | This is a frequently asked question . Every time it arises , it causes | months of debate . So let me see if I can answer you directly . | Basically it 's because the Law was given to Moses as part of a | specific covenanent with the Jews . Most of us are n't Jews , so we | are n't part of that covenant . There was an argument early in | Christian history about whether the Mosaic laws should apply to | Gentiles who became Christians . You can see the account of this | debate in Acts 15 . The main question there was circumcision , but | keeping the Sabbath would be part of it as well . The apostles | concluded that we need not become Jews in order to become Christians , | and therefore that rules such as circumcision did not apply to us . 1 . The law was known to man before it was revealed on Mount Sinai . Rom 4:15 notes that `` where no law is , there is no transgression . '' Not only did sin exist before Sinai ( Eden ) , but the Sabbath was kept before it was revealed on Sinai ( Ex 16 ) . 2 . The problem with the first covenant was not the law , but the promise which undergirded it . God wanted to perform his will in the lives of the people , but in their ignorance after 400 years of slavery , they promised '' what ever He says to do we will do . '' That is why the new covenant is based on `` better promises '' ( Heb . 8:6 ) . Rather than do away with the law God promised to `` put my laws in their minds and write them on their hearts '' ( Heb . 8:10 ) . 3 . Including the Sabbath in the Acts 15 is selective inclusion . The Sabbath was more important to the Jews than circumcision . If any attempt had been made to do away with the Sabbath the reaction would have been even more strident than is recorded in Acts 15 . Do not confuse the weekly Sabbath of the Decalogue with the ceremonial sabbaths which could occur at any time of the week and were part of the law ( ceremonial ) which was *added* because of transgression ( of the moral law ) ( Gal 3:19 ) . 4 . Israel stands for God 's people of all time . That is why God *grafted* the Gentiles in . Roma 9:4 says that the adoption , the glory , the covenants , the giving of the law , the service of God and the promises belong to Israelites . In explanation Paul makes it clear that being born into Israel is not enough `` For they are not all Israel , which are of Israel '' v 6 . Then in Gal 3:19 he says `` if ye be Christ 's , then are ye Abraham 's seed , and heirs according to the promise . '' All Christians are Abraham 's seed , Jews , Israelites . Not physically , for that is not the criterion , but spiritually . We are joint heirs with Jesus based on the promise God made to all his people the Israelites . | | While Christians agree that the OT Laws do not all apply to us , | because some of them are part of a specific covenanent with the Jews , | we also expect to see some similarity between the things God expected | from the Jews and the things he expects from us . After all , it 's the | same God . However there are several ways of dealing with this . | | These days the most common approach is to separate the OT commandments | into `` moral '' and `` ceremonial '' . Ceremonial commandments apply only to | the Jews . They are part of the specific Mosaic covenant . These are | thinsg like the kosher laws and circumcision . Moral laws apply to | everyone . Most of the 10 commands are part of the moral law , except | for the commandment about the Sabbath . I believe most people who take | this approach would say that the specific requirement to worship on | the Sabbath is part of the ceremonial law , but a general obligation to | worship regularly is part of the general moral law . Thus Christians | are free to choose the specific time we worship . People would probably agree but they are wrong . How can the Sabbath commandment be ceremonial when it is part of a law which predates the ceremonial laws ? You are not free to choose your time of worship . Even if you were why do you follow a day of worship which has its origins in pagan sun worship . Would you rather give up a day which God blessed , sanctified , and hallowed in exchange for one which all church leaders agree has not biblical foundation ( see Sabbath Admissions in soc.religion.christian.bible-study ) . | | A more radical approach ( which is generally connected with John Calvin | and the Reformed tradition ) says that the Law as a whole is no longer | binding . Instead , we are entirely under grace , and our behavior | should be guided solely by love . Portions of the OT Law are still | useful as guidance . But they are not properly speaking legally | binding on us . In practice most people who take this position do not | believe it is safe to leave Christians without moral guidannce . While | we may no longer be under Law , as sinners , it 's not safe for us to go | into situations with no principles to guide us . We 're too good at | self-justification for that to be safe . Thus Christians do have moral | guidance , from things like Jesus ' teachings , Paul 's advice , etc . | These may not be precisely a Law , but they serve much the same | function as , and have largely the same content as , the `` moral law '' in | the previous analysis . While Calvin would deny that we have a fixed | legal responsibility to worship on any specific day , he would say that | given human weakness , the discipline of regular worship is important . | I do not care what Calvin or any theologian says . My guide is what God says . If being not under the law means we do not have to keep the law , why is it that the only section of the law we have trouble with is the Sabbath commandment , which is the only one God thought was important enough to say *REMEMBER* ? If you study the word deeply you will note that the message is that we are no longer under the condemnation of the law but freed by the grace of God . If a cop pulls me over for speeding , then in court I ask for mercy and the judge does not throw the book at me but gives me grace , do I walk out of the court saying `` I can now go on speeding , for I am now under grace ? '' Being under grace I now drive within the speed limit . Paul adds to it in Rom . 3:31 `` Di we then make void the law through faith ? God forbid : yea , we establish the law . '' `` Wherefore the law is holy , and the commandment holy , and just , and good '' ( Rom . 7:12 ) . | In both analyses , the specific day is not an issue . As a matter of | tradition , we worship on Sunday as a memorial of Christ's | resurrection . There 's some debate about what Acts shows about early | Christian worship . The most common analysis is that is shows Jewish | Christians continuing to go to Jewish services on the Sabbath , but | that specifically Christian service were not necessarily held then . | Act 20:7 shows worship on the first day ( Sunday ) , and I Cor 16:2 also | implies gatherings on that day . | | There are a few groups that continue to believe Christians have to | worship on the Sabbath ( Saturday ) . The best-known are the Seventh-Day | Adventists and Jehovah 's Witnesses . They argue that Act 20:7 is not a | regular worship service , but a special meeting to see Paul off , and | that I Cor 16:2 does n't explicitly say it 's a regular worship service . Do you prefer implication to fact ? A careful study of the Acts 20 shows that the meeting was on Saturday night and that on Sunday morning Paul did not go to a worship service , but set off on a long journey by foot to Assos . In ICor 16 there is no way you can equate `` lay by him in store '' with `` go to a worship service . '' | | It 's clear that this issue was a contested one in Paul 's time . See | Rom 14:5 . Paul 's advice is that we should be very careful about | judging each other on issues like this . One person sees a specific | day as mandated by God , while another does not . He who observes that | specific day does it in honor of the Lord . He who believes his | worship is free of such restrictions also does it in honor of the | Lord . ( Those who believe that the Sabbath is still mandated argue | that Paul is not referring to Sabbath worship here . Note however Col | 2:16 , which says something similar but briefer . It explicitly | mentions Sabbath . ) Wrong . These are the sabbath days of the ceremonial law , not the Sabbath day of the moral law . | | There are some differences among Christians about use of the word | `` Sabbath '' . Originally the term referred to the 7th Day , the Jewish | day of worship . Many Christians now use it to refer to Sunday , the | day of Christian worship . They do this largely so that they can apply | the 4th ( or whatever -- there are a couple of different numbering | schemes ) commandment to it . Reformed tradition does not do this . It | distinguishes between the Sabbath -- which is the observance mandated | for Jews , and the Lord 's Day -- which is the free Christian worship . | ( The only reference I can find to this in the NT is Rev 1:10 . ) There | are also differences about laws regarding this day . Many Christians | support `` blue laws '' , both in secular law and church law , setting aside | that day and causing people to spend it in worship . The more radical | anti-legal approach sees such regulations as a return to the Jewish | Sabbath , which is not appropriate to the free Christian worship of the | Lord 's Day . | Why would you prefer to twist and turn , relying on different arguments which conflict with each other , rather than obey a simple request from a God who loved you enough to die for you . Jesus died because the law could not be changed . Why bother to die in order to meet the demands of a broken law if all you need to do is change the law . Penalties for law breaking means the law is immutable . That is why it is no sin not to follow the demands of the ceremonial laws . It will always be a sin to make false gods , to violate God 's name , to break the Sabbath , to steal , to kill , etc . Except it you disagree . But then your opinion has no weight when placed next to the word of God . Darius [ It 's not clear how much more needs to be said other than the FAQ . I think Paul 's comments on esteeming one day over another ( Rom 14 ) is probably all that needs to be said . I accept that Darius is doing what he does in honor of the Lord . I just wish he might equally accept that those who `` esteem all days alike '' are similarly doing their best to honor the Lord . However I 'd like to be clear that I do not think there 's unambiguous proof that regular Christian worship was on the first day . As I indicated , there are responses on both of the passages cited . The difficulty with both of these passages is that they are actually about something else . They both look like they are talking about nnregular Christian meetings , but neither explicitly says `` and they gathered every Sunday for worship '' . We get various pieces of information , but nothing aimed at answering this question . Act 2:26 describes Christians as participating both in Jewish temple worship and in Christian communion services in homes . Obviously the temple worship is on the Sabbath . Acts 13:44 is an example of Christians participating in them . Unfortunately it does n't tell us what day Christians met in their houses . Acts 20:7 , despite Darius' confusion , is described by Acts as occuring on Sunday . ( I see no reason to impose modern definitions of when days start , when the Biblical text is clear about what was meant . ) The wording implies to me that this was a normal meeting . It does n't say they gathered to see Paul off , but that when they were gathered for breaking bread , Paul talked about his upcoming travel . But that 's just not explicit enough to be really convincing . Similarly with 1 Cor 16:2 . It says that on the first day they should set aside money for Paul's collection . Now if you want to believe that they gathered specially to do this , or that they did it in their homes , I ca n't disprove it , but the obvious time for a congregation to take an offering would be when they normally gather for worship , and if they were expected to do it in their homes there would be no reason to mention a specific day . So I think the most obvious reading of this is that `` on the first day of every week '' simply means every time they gather for worship . I think the reason we have only implications and not clear statements is that the NT authors assumed that their readers knew when Christian worship was . -- clh ]

That was the bronze medal game in the SM-liiga which Tichonov 's team Porin Assat ( the Aces of town Pori : ) lost . Vasili , the son of Victor Tichonov ( the famous Soviet coach ) , said that for a long time the Sharks have been persuading him to take the assistant coach post . But he wants to be the head coach where ever he goes . He definitely wo n't be coaching Assat anymore ( after three ? seasons ) . I do n't know why . Vasili is a good coach I believe . Assat was a good team , produced many players to our national team . Assat was n't a skilled team ( IMHO ) but they had the fighting spirit . After all , they butchered Jokerit in the playoffs and gave hard time to TPS , the champs . But Assat wasn't consistent , only when they were in the right mood they could beat any team in the SM-liiga . I am not 100 % sure about the deal with the Sharks . As I said , he wants to be the head coach . But he and the Sharks are going to negotiate and decide during the WC . I doubt that he will be the head coach but maybe they 'll do some compromise . Could somebody post more information about Vasili ? I know he was coaching in the former Soviet league ; teams , results ? His character as a coach ?

There 's documentation on how to use the shared memory extension in the X11R5 distribution . Actually , I just finished writing a motif animation program ... ( take-lots-of-image-data-and-display-it-pretty-darn-fast ) . When using on-server pixmaps or shared memory , I had to insert a delay loop to keep it from going too quickly : ) . Testing both methods side by side , they were just about equal . The advantage of SHM is that your X server does n't grow to ridiculous sizes ; but pixmaps can work over a network and *are* removed if your application dies ( one tends to use ipcrm manually quite a bit when debugging SHM apps ) . Shared memory also has the problem that some operating systems ( e.g . Ultrix ) seem to allow only a small number of segments ( ~6 ) to be attached to a process at once ; consequently , a redraw becomes XShmAttach ( ) ; XShmPutImage ( ) ; XShmDetach ( ) ; on Dec systems . And Dec 's 24 bit displays ( like the ones I tend to use most often ) do n't seem to support the extension ( maybe someone compiled them wrong ? ) , and using pixmaps causes the X server to crash ( failed mallocs ) , so one *has* to use the local unix domain socket ( which really is n't that bad ; one copies the info three times per redraw instead of one ) . In short : allowing all three forms of display , within the program is a Good Thing ( minus SHM if running over a network ) , and let the user pick whatever feels fastest .

From : Center for Policy Research < cpr @ igc.apc.org > Subject : Gaza and separation from Israel Nf-ID : # N : cdp:1483500357:000:3740 Nf-From : cdp.UUCP ! cpr Apr 24 07:06:00 1993 Lines : 73 From : Center for Policy Research < cpr > Subject : Gaza and separation from Israel Gaza and the idea of separation The Israeli Left 's inability to cope with the challenges it is presented with by reality becomes obvious at those moments when the reality does not line up with the expectations of the left . We were able to see this clearly during the Gulf War . Because of the Palestinian 's popular solidarity with Iraq , Yossi Sarid - currently Minister of the Environment - made his infamous statement : `` You look for me ! `` , i.e. , I'am not making any more efforts to speak with you . From Yossi Sarid 's point of view , Palestinian reality during the Gulf War was not the lengthy curfew or the danger of hunger it brought with it , but whether or not the Palestinians accepted what was acceptable to the party . Similarly MERETZ , MK Deddi Tzuker , recently faced with criticism from residents of the West Bank town of Beit Sahour over his government 's and his party 's lack of action for human rights and peace , responded by asking those present at the discussion whether they would rather have a Likud government . From the Leftists' perspective this is the best government because it is THEIR government , regardless of what it does . These members of the Israeli Left have already decided how the future of the Occupied Territories will look , and they want to dictate to the Palestinians how to get there . An essential step towards this future is their participation in Yitzhak Rabin's government , and from their point of view the expulsions were a marginal byproduct of this `` government of peace '' , which need not disturb the routine course of events . Likewise the `` Rabinic '' policies in Gaza - the blowing up of houses with anti-tank rockets and the significant increases in the number of persons injured in the suppression of demonstrations - need not disturb it . But the fact that reality is not as they would have it forces itself upon them when a mob in Gaza falls upon a settler who has lost his way , when a settler is stabbed by his Palestinian workers , or when a Palestinian knifes people in the streets of Tel Aviv . Then all hell breaks loose and the Israeli Left has nothing to propose except separation : Let 's cut ourselves off from the Palestinians , let 's build a fence so high that they wo n't be able to harm us - this is the cry of the Israeli Left . Let us erect a fence between us and the reality whith is the occupation . Meron Benvenisti writes about this in Ha'aretz ( 4-3-93 ) : `` ... The liberal Left . which does not differentiate between physical separation and 'the future of the territories ' , must come to understand that the regime of magnetic cards , exclusion of Arab workers , closure , and curfew are instruments of enforcement designed for the suppression of a population in revolt , and that their ideological support for separation only provides 'humanitarian ' arguments for the legitimization of the < status quo > . Enforced separation is carried out only to meet the need of the ruling community , but it is only the ruled population which bears its burden . [ ... .. ] . `` Whoover thinks that 'out of Gaza first ' is a liberal , humanitarian idea had best contemplate the question of whether this position is also moral . It is very easy to shake off responsibility for this concentration of human suffering , and to thus also disregard responsibility for it 's creation . It is very easy to erect a fence between Jewish and Arab neighborhoods in Jerusalem , when this fence has a gate - the keys to which are at the disposal of one hand - which opens to allow the Jews to pursue all their interests , but is barred to the Arabs ...

From : martinh @ cac.washington.EDU ( Martin Hunt ) Subject : Announcing tcpview : A Motif-based TCP/IP protocol analyzer Organization : UW Networks and Distributed Computing Lines : 89 Keywords : protocol analyzer TCP/IP To : xannounce @ expo.lcs.mit.edu Tcpview is the result of several problems we had at UW . We have several Network General Sniffers which are heavily used to help debug problems on several hundred subnets . These are good tools , but they are 1 ) heavy , 2 ) hard to find when you need one , 3 ) limited in their software expandibility , 4 ) difficult to use to upload data for analysis , 5 ) can not be remotely operated , and 6 ) can not resolve names with DNS , requiring much manual manipulation of the name table . We also sometimes use tcpdump , but we found it 1 ) too difficult for most people , 2 ) did not have enough information for many protocols , 3 ) could not be used interactively , 4 ) could not handle TCP streams and 5 ) could not read Sniffer files . However , tcpdump did do a reasonable job of decoding a large number of protocols , and could be easily modified . Tcpview is an attempt to resolve these problems by adding a Motif interface to tcpdump and expanding its features . Tcpview has been tested on a DECstation 5000 and Sun 4 under Ultrix 4.2 and SunOS 4.1 respectively . It should work on the same systems as tcpdump . It compiles with cc and gcc on the DEC and Sun . To build tcpview you will need Motif 1.1 or better . The following files are available for anonymous ftp from ftp.cac.washington.edu in /pub/networking tcpview-1.0.tar.Z tcpview and tcpdump source code tcpview-1.0.sun.tar.Z Sun4 binaries tcpview-1.0.dec.tar.Z DEC Mips Ultrix 4.2 binaries What tcpview adds to tcpdump : - easier interface - enhanced protocol decoding - hex display of frame - capture based on time , number of frames , or user interrupt - can show ethernet addresses with manufacturer 's name - ethernet address host table - can easily follow a stream , highlighting out-of-order frames - can send TCP data to an external file or filter for additional processing . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - CHANGES TO TCPDUMP 2.2.1 New features : Now reads and writes Network General Sniffer files .

Let 's say you even trust the escrow houses -- one is > the ACLU and the other is the EFF . ( And I 'm not entirely joking about > those two names ) The problem with `` Let 's assume '' reasoning is that , taken to the extreme ( and you 're close ) , you arrive at `` Let 's assume this is perfectly OK. '' The assumptions you make are big ones . If the system is really secure , then why does the government have to keep the algorithm secret ? There are plenty of encryption algorithms that do n't depend upon nondisclosure to be secure , so why in the world use one that does ? There are reasons , of course , but I certainly ca n't think of any honest ones . Next , you assume we can `` trust '' the escrow houses . But the last time I checked , EVERY SINGLE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT has experienced unauthorized disclosure , corruption , and even fabrication , of supposedly secure data . The govt is saying `` Yeah , but NOW we 're serious , so you can trust us . '' Bullcrypt . And finally , although you did n't state it explicitly , you implicitly assume that the warrant mechanism in this country is safe and reasonable . The case in Ventura County of a man shot and killed by officers serving a deliberately fraudulant warrant tells me that the govt has a long ways to go on this score . Remember that all this is to catch the drug dealers , right ? As others have pointed out , the current proposal will , if deployed , render truly secure encryption much more expensive and inconvenient than Uncle Sam 's brand . Who will be able to afford , and be sufficiently motivated , to purchase this expensive , inconvenient higher protection ? Somebody with lots of extra cash ...

Are they the same > or part of them are the same ? How about Torah ? Are the first five books > of OT as the same as Torah ? ? ? ? ? Yes , yes , and yes . Jewish history as recorded in the Old Testament and as shown by archaeology are the same . Kings , revivals , Temples , and all . The Torah , as far as I know , is the five books of Moses . Then come the Prophets ( all the Prophets , plus Joshua , Judges , 1 & 2 Samuel , 1 & 2 Kings ) and the Writings ( Psalms , Proverbs , Lamentations , Ruth , Esther , Ezra , Nehemiah , Ecclesiates , Song of Songs , 1 & 2 Chronicles , Job ) . And the veracity of Isaiah , which you quoted to your Moslem friend is quite well known . A complete manuscript exists that dates back to past 200 BC , and is kept in a Museum in Israel . It was found among the Dead Sea Scrolls , which greatly enhanced our knowledge of the veracity of the Old Testament , as they date back to around the time of Christ , whereas before , the oldest complete manuscript in Hebrew was from around 900 AD . Your Moslem friend is sorely mistaken , but understandably so . If Jesus was crucified , and atoned for our sins , he must have been God , for only the death of God could atone for the sins of all humanity . And as Isaiah predicts , the messiah will be called `` the mighty God . '' And if he was God , then he must have rose , for as St. Paul wrote , it was not possible that death could hold him . And if Jesus rose from the dead , your Moslem friend would have little reason to be a Moslem . Which is why he denies the authenticity of the Old Testament . Andy Byler

For example - how often are crimes of violence not `` hate crimes '' ? The question is then who are you hating ? If its another gang member , then its better than if the person you hate is of a differnt color ? Also , is it realistic to declare that crimes of hate are worse than crimes of gross negligence ?

After all , the bomb was a single act . First , I heard today that there is a good chance that the U.S. instead of New York is going after the bombers . This means no capital punishment . Secondly , double jepardy does help keep the government from going after you for first one murder , then the next , etc . A `` sovereign '' has essentially one chance with a single fact pattern ( such as the World Trade Center bombing ) . That is why the bombers will in all probability be tried for all the deaths , as well as the property damages , as well as conspiracy , at once . Of course , as we discovered in the Rodney King case , there are two '' sovereigns '' , neither of which can try you twice for the same crime . Bruce E. Hayden ( 303 ) 758-8400 bhayden @ csn.org

This morning about 6:00 , the feds punched holes in the compound walls by using a tank . They then started using non-lethal tear gas . Shortly after noon , 2 cult members were seen setting fire to the compound . So far , about 20-30 people have been seen outside the compound . The fate of the other 60 or 70 people is unknown , neither is the fate of the 17 children that were inside . The compound did burn to the ground . Koresh , who at times has claimed to be the Messiah , but then backed off and only claimed to be a prophet , had promised several times to come out peacefully if his demands were met . First , he demanded that his message be broadcast on the radio , which it was , but he did n't come out . He claimed to be waiting for a message from God . Finally , he said that God told him that he needed to decipher the mystery of the 7 seals in Revelation , and when he was finished , he 'd come out . He finished the first one , but did n't do any more work that anyone knows of since then . The federal agents did warn him that if they did n't come out , they would be subjected to tear gas . I think it 's really sad that so many people put their faith in a mere man , even if he did claim to be the son of God , and/or a prophet . I think it underscores the importance of putting you faith only in things that are eternal and knowing for yourself what the Scriptures say and what they mean , instead of relying on others to do it for you , even if those others are learned and mean well .

Excuse me ? `` We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work of extermination . Our troops surrounded village after village . Little resistance was offered . Our artillery knocked the huts into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable and inhabitants fled from them into fields , bullets and bayonets completed the work . Some of the Tartars escaped of course . They found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border into Turkey . The rest were killed . And so it is that the whole length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of Tartar villages . They are quiet now , those villages , except for howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the scattered bones of the dead . '' Ohanus Appressian `` Men Are Like That '' p. 202 . A genocide is a deliberate and organized massacre of people in an attempt to exterminate a race . This is the worst crime in history . It happened to the Turks in eastern Anatolia and the Armenian dictatorship . 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were killed in the worst ways imaginable . It is sickening to think that the human race is capable of such actions , but there is no denying the fact that the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Muslims happened . People of Turkiye deeply sympathize with those whose relatives were killed in the Turkish genocide . I understand their anger that there are those who still deny that the Turkish genocide indeed took place , despite the fact that the genocide of 2.5 million Turks has been well documented over the past six decades . We can not reverse the events of the past , but we can and we must strive to keep the memory of this tragedy alive on this side of the Atlantic , so as to help prevent a recurrence of the extermination of a people because of their religion or their race . Source : Bristol Papers , General Correspondence : Container # 32 - Bristol to Bradley Letter of September 14 , 1920 . `` I have it from absolute first-hand information that the Armenians in the Caucasus attacked Tartar ( Turkish ) villages that are utterly defenseless and bombarded these villages with artillery and they murder the inhabitants , pillage the village and often burn the village . '' > Lets get somethings straight . Why not ? > 1 . Armenians are no angels , but they were subject to Turkish genocide . And the Germans were subject to Jewish Genocide ? Are you for real ? Tell me 'Halsall ' , were you high on `` ASALA/SDPA/ARF '' forgeries and fabrications when you wrote that ? Where is your non-existent list of scholars . Here is mine : During the First World War and the ensuing years - 1914-1920 , the Armenian Dictatorship through a premeditated and systematic genocide , tried to complete its centuries-old policy of annihilation against the Turks and Kurds by savagely murdering 2.5 million Muslims and deporting the rest from their 1,000 year homeland . The attempt at genocide is justly regarded as the first instance of Genocide in the 20th Century acted upon an entire people .

Now wait , there is more . Mark Alan Epstein , 'The Ottoman Jewish Communities and their Role in the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries , ' Klaus Schwarz Werlag , Freiburg ( 1980 ) . page 19 : < < During the fifteenth century , when the Ottomans were struggling to reestablish themselves in the Balkans , there was considerable turmoil among the Jewish communities in Central and Western Europe . Even if the difficulties of the darker centuries immediately preceding the fourteenth are minimized , it is easy to understand the attraction which Ottoman life , particularly when compared to life in Europe , held for the Jews . There is no way to tell how many Jews left Christendom for the realm of the rising Muslim Ottomans , but with each account of persecution in or expulsion from Christian countries it is recorded that some Jews fled to Ottoman territory . The regularity of these reports suggests that the Ottomans were considered reasonably tolerant protectors and that there was a regular trickle of Jewish families moving southward and eastward from Western and Central Europe . ( ... ) It is evident that the effects of plague , late crusades , and the general intolerance and persecution of Jews in Christian Europe resulted in the redirection of the whole focus of Jewish life which , for more than two centuries , was to be oriented toward Muslim East. > > page 21 : < < In the second quarter of the fifteenth century the foremost official in the Edirne Jewish community was Rabbi Yitzhak Sarfati the Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi of the city . He was the most important rabbi in the city and the author of an important letter which tells us something of the situation of the Edirne Jewry in the fifteenth century . Sarfati himself was from Christian Europe and supposedly wrote this letter at the behest of two recent arrivals from there , who , upon seeing the prosperity and freedom of the Ottoman Jews , prevailed upon him to write their European coreligionists apprising them of the situation and urging them to migrate . This remarkable letter advised its recipients not only of the pleasant conditions in the Ottoman domains , but described as well the ease of travel to Palestine and the holy places , an attraction to those who would make a pilgrimage or choose to be buried there. > > ( * ) page 41 : < < ... the impression gained from the Hebrew sources is that the Jews were firmly aware of the community of interests which existed between them and the Ottomans , especially in comparison to relations with the Christians of Europe . Confirmation of the commonality of interests between Muslims and Jews is also indicated by the fact that European Christians perceived the Jews as allies of Islam and were well aware of Muslim-Jewish cooperation . Certainly the activity of important Jewish financiers and politicians representing the Ottoman government abroad did not pass unnoticed . European sources are the basis for much of our knowledge of their careers . In addition it appears that Christian pirates plundered `` Turks and Jews , '' their sworn enemies , and that Europeans considered the Jews to be agents who regularly reported to the Ottomans . There are well-known examples of overt Jewish support for the Ottomans in the struggle against European powers . The two best known instances of Jewish support for the campaigning Ottomans are the frequently cited instances of the Jewish contributions to the conquests of Buda , in the early sixteenth century , and of Rhodes . We also have reports of sympathy for the Ottomans during the siege of Chios . An unpublished Ottoman document shows dramatically the mutual interests which existed in some Greek towns ... > > page 43 : < < It is clear that throughout the sixteenth century it was a generally accepted fact that the interests of Jews and Muslims coincided frequently , and all parties involved , Jews , Muslims , and Christians , were aware of the situation. > > page 46 : < < ... it seems that the relations between Greeks and Jews were not particularly cordial . The two groups had little in common , few common interests , and perceived no common philosophical or religious tradition which could serve as the basis for cooperation , rather than enmity . If there was any identifiable bond of good will which existed between religious communities in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries , it was that between Muslims and Jews , neither of whom had much in common with the Orthodox. > > page 46 : < < The general impression of Muslim-Jewish relations in the Ottoman context during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries is one of community of interests . From the earliest times the Ottomans seem to have welcomed Jews to their territory and to have found in the communities already existing in places which they conquered a cooperative element . The Jewish response to this tolerance was a steady flow of Jews from Christian countries to Ottoman domains. > > page 151 : < < From the period before 1453 we have only a few indications that the Ottoman-Jewish relationship was well on the course of amity which would characterize it for years afterward , but the liberality of the Ottomans , in contrast to the intolerance of the Byzantines , and the protection and the security which the Ottomans offered , in comparison to conditions elsewhere , leave little doupt that even then both the Ottomans and the Jews recognized their mutual interests ... > > page 161 : < < It is impossible to say how fundamental the Jews were in the success of the Ottomans in rebuilding Istanbul or in Ottoman mercantile success in the sixteenth century . That they played an important role in both can not be doupted . It is also unclear whether they were important enough to say that the Ottomans would not have experienced their great success without the Jews and that no other group could have been found to serve the Ottomans as well as did the Jews . It is , however , unmistakably clear that there are few parallels in world history to this remarkable partnership between Jews and the non-Jewish society in which they lived . We must conclude that the Ottomans could probably not achieved their success without a group performing certain tasks for them as well as the Jews did . Certainly for the Jews of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the Ottoman Empire was a most remarkable and salubrious home. > > ( * ) A version of Rabbi Sarfati 's [ Tzarfati ] letter is given by Prof.Shaw : page 32 : < < Your cries and sobs reached us . We have been told of all the troubles and persecutions which you have to suffer in the German lands ... .I hear the lamentation of my brethren ... The barbarous and cruel nation ruthlessly oppresses the faithful children of the chosen people ... The priests and prelates of Rome have risen . They wish to root out the memory of Jacob and erase the name of Israel . They always devise new persecutions . They wish to bring you to the stake ... Listen my brethren , to the counsel I will give you . I too was born in Germany and studied Torah with the German rabbis . I was driven out of my native country and came to the Turkish land , which is blessed by God and filled with all good things . Here I found rest and happiness ; Turkey can also become for you the land of peace ... If you who live in Germany knew even a tenth of what God has blessed us with in this land , you would not consider any difficulties ; you would set out to come to us ... Here in the land of the Turks we have nothing to complain of . We possess great fortunes ; much gold and silver in our hands . We are not oppressed with heavy taxes , and our commerce is free and unhindered . Rich are the fruits of the earth . Everything is cheap , and every one of us lives in peace and freedom . Here the Jew is not compelled to wear a yellow hat as a badge of shame , as is the case in Germany , where even wealth and great fortune are a curse for a Jew because he therewith arouses jealousy among the Christians and they devise all kinds of slander against him to rob him of his gold . Arise my brethren , gird up your loins , collect your forces , and come to us . Here you will be free of your enemies , here you will find rest ... > > [ 13 ] [ 13 ] Israel Zinberg , A History Of Jewish Literature . vol.V .

This , at least , has already been determined : The Blue Cross medical coverage for all federal employees is a good model for a future national system . To get emergency medical care , anyone so insured must always carry their Blue Cross card . Before entering a hospital , you must notify Blue Cross , or they will refuse to pay your bills . In an emergency , where you must be treated before notifying them , you must inform them within 24 hours or ( if you are unable to do so for medical reasons ) the hospital must . Failing to do so within 24 hours means they will not cover the hospitalization . In you need your card to notify them ( and without the card , the hospital certainly would n't know they had to . ) Therefore , you are required to carry the card at all times , or do without emergency medical coverage .

Right on , Jon ! Who cares who or whose , as long as it works for the individual . But do n't try to impose those beliefs on us or our children . I would add the well-funded group tries also to purge science , to deny children access to great wonders and skills . And how about the kids born to creationists ? What a burden with which to begin adult life . It must be a cruel awakening for those who finally see the light , provided it is possible to escape from the depths of this type of ignorance .

This is logically bankrupt -- > where is the proof of this nonexistence ? It 's a joke . This is one of my favorite fallacious points against atheism , i.e . the belief that you ca n't deny anything that you ca n't prove does n't exist . This is easily nailed by showing that an infinite number of beings are conceivable but not observed to exist , does this mean that we would have to believe in all of them ? According to the above poster , we must believe in objects or beings that have n't been proved not to exist so why stop at God ? ( there could be a huge number of beings identical to Ronald Reagan except for trivial differences , say one is missing a finger , one has blond hair , ... and they all live on other planets so we ca n't see them ) The reason no one but atheists bring this up is that none of these christians have a vested interest in these unknown beings with the exception of God . > Fine , but why do these people shoot themselves in the foot and mock the idea of > a God ? Here again is a classic atheist fallacy . How did they shoot themselves in the foot ? > Radical Muslims , the Crusades , the Inquisition are common examples that > atheists like to bring up as marks against religion . How weak ! Only fools can > take that drivel seriously . How about the grand-daddy of all human atrocities , > the Stalinist movement ? > Twenty eight MILLION people _killed_ under this leadership , which > proudly featured atheism . There is a big difference here , Stalin did n't say that he stood for a particular moral position ( i.e . against murder and terrorism , etc . ) and then did the opposite ( like the religious movements ) , he was at least an honest killer . ( This is NOT a support of Stalin but an attack on this viewpoint ) . Saying that atheism supports murder and violence just because one man was a tyrant and an atheist is just bad logic , look at all the russians that helped Stalin that were n't atheists - do n't they contradict your point ? Besides your point assumes that his atheism was relevant to his murdering people , this is just the common assumption that atheists ca n't value life as much as theists ( which you did n't support ) . > Agnostics are not as funny because they are more reasonable . Yet > they do in some sense seem funny because they believe that the existence of God > is unknowable . This in itself is every bit the assumption that atheism is , > though it 's less arrogant and pompous . Ah , and here 's another point you did n't get out of the FAQ . An atheist does n't have to hold the positive view that god does n't exist , he/she may just have the non-existence of the positive belief . Here 's the example : Strong atheism - `` I believe god does not exist '' a positive belief Weak atheism - `` I do n't believe in a god '' a negative belief these are NOT the same , some one that has never thought of the idea of god in their whole life is technically an atheist , but not the kind that you are calling unreasonable . Or let 's look at it this way ( in sets ) suppose that a given person has a huge set of ideas that I will represent as capital letters and these people then either believe that these ideas exist as real objects or not . So if S = santa , then E ( S ) = no is the person not believing in santa but still having the idea of santa . But notice that even E ( S ) = no is itself another idea ! This means you have lots of cases : christian : ( A , E ( A ) =yes , B , E ( B ) =no , . . . G , E ( G ) =yes ... ... ) where G = god atheist ( strong ) : ( A , E ( A ) . . . . .G , E ( G ) =no ) atheist ( weak ) : ( A , ... ..E ) i.e . no G at all in the set agnostic : ( A , ... ... .G , E ( G ) = indeterminate , E ' , ... . ) > Why are people so afraid to say `` undecided '' ?

It 's not blasphemous . > It 's not political . In fact it is too often taken to mean unsophisticated . Nietzsche once said that a man would rather will nonexistence than not will at all but the darwinist way to put this is that humanity always prefers no or yes to a maybe because indecision is not a useful survival trait , evolution has drilled it in us to take positions , even false ones . > Bake Timmons , III M.S .

I would expect this kind of behavior from the Evangelical Born-Again Gospel-Thumping In-Your-Face We're- The-Only-True-Christian Protestants , but I have always thought that Catholics behaved better than this . Friend Dennis , I urge you to follow the example of your fellow Catholics , of who I count many dozens as my friends , and practice your faith through good example and decent living and respect for the common humanity of others . Please do not stoop to the level of the E B-A G-T I-Y-F W-T-O-T-C Protestants , who think that the best way to witness is to be strident , intrusive , loud , insulting and overbearingly self-righteous . The imagery in the Song of Solomon is a little bit dated ( get it ? Middle East - date palms - oh , never mind ) but apparently acceptable , on a steaminess level , to be accepted as part of the canon . From this fact I derive that erotica itself is not incompatible with Catholic doctrine . Is there such a thing as Catholic erotica ? Not necessarily a love story between people of that faith , but a love story that is not exploitative , does not seek redemption through penis size , pays proper respect to the dignity of each partner , and is still erotic enough to have a place on a.s.s . I would submit that the _Darknites_ series of stories qualify , also most of the _Journal Entries_ , and _Rings I and II_ . I would guess that your aim is to cut down on the pornography and increase the erotica . I actually agree with you that nearly all of the `` I 've got an enormous dick , and I shot my wad all over her face '' stories are crap .

Covington I do recall Watt making a comment to this effect , though it was quite a few years back and I ca n't cite the specifics . I also recall that Cecil Andrus , who was Secretary of the Interior during the Carter Administration , responded to Watt 's comments by pointing out the stewardship role that God gave to man , as recorded in Genesis . Which makes me wonder : who are the true conservatives ? It seems to me that a *conservative* should want to *conserve* things of value for long-term societal benefit . This form of *conservation* should logically extend to the physical environment in which people live , as well as the moral environment in which they relate to one another and to God . IMHO , Watt 's stewardship status is not enhanced by the fact that he served on the board of directors for Jim Bakker 's organization , during a time in which Bakker committed criminal acts which eventually landed Bakker in federal prison .

Basics of public-key cryptography . The RSA version , its security , speed of factoring . Other approaches . X-Last-Updated : 1993/04/16 Archive-name : cryptography-faq/part06 Last-modified : 1993/4/15 FAQ for sci.crypt , part 6 : Public-Key Cryptography This is the sixth of ten parts of the sci.crypt FAQ . The parts are mostly independent , but you should read the first part before the rest . We do n't have the time to send out missing parts by mail , so do n't ask . Notes such as `` [ KAH67 ] '' refer to the reference list in the last part . The sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu as /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part [ xx ] . The Cryptography FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt , sci.answers , and news.answers every 21 days . Contents : * What is public-key cryptography ? * What 's RSA ? * Is RSA secure ? * How fast can people factor numbers ? * What about other public-key cryptosystems ? * What is public-key cryptography ? In a classic cryptosystem , we have encryption functions E_K and decryption functions D_K such that D_K ( E_K ( P ) ) = P for any plaintext P. In a public-key cryptosystem , E_K can be easily computed from some `` public key '' X which in turn is computed from K. X is published , so that anyone can encrypt messages . If D_K can not be easily computed from X , then only the person who generated K can decrypt messages . That 's the essence of public-key cryptography , published by Diffie and Hellman in 1976 . In a classic cryptosystem , if you want your friends to be able to send secret messages to you , you have to make sure nobody other than them sees the key K. In a public-key cryptosystem , you just publish X , and you do n't have to worry about spies . This is only the beginning of public-key cryptography . There is an extensive literature on security models for public-key cryptography , applications of public-key cryptography , other applications of the mathematical technology behind public-key cryptography , and so on . * What 's RSA ? RSA is a public-key cryptosystem defined by Rivest , Shamir , and Adleman . For full details , there is a FAQ available by ftp at RSA.COM . Here 's a small example . Plaintexts are positive integers up to 2^ { 512 } . Keys are quadruples ( p , q , e , d ) , with p a 256-bit prime number , q a 258-bit prime number , and d and e large numbers with ( de - 1 ) divisible by ( p-1 ) ( q-1 ) . We define E_K ( P ) = P^e mod pq , D_K ( C ) = C^d mod pq . Now E_K is easily computed from the pair ( pq , e ) -- -but , as far as anyone knows , there is no easy way to compute D_K from the pair ( pq , e ) . So whoever generates K can publish ( pq , e ) . Anyone can send a secret message to him ; he is the only one who can read the messages . * Is RSA secure ? Nobody knows . An obvious attack on RSA is to factor pq into p and q . See below for comments on how fast state-of-the-art factorization algorithms run . Unfortunately nobody has the slightest idea how to prove that factorization -- -or any realistic problem at all , for that matter -- -is inherently slow . It is easy to formalize what we mean by `` RSA is/is n't strong '' ; but , as Hendrik W. Lenstra , Jr. , says , `` Exact definitions appear to be necessary only when one wishes to prove that algorithms with certain properties do _not_ exist , and theoretical computer science is notoriously lacking in such negative results . '' * How fast can people factor numbers ? It depends on the size of the numbers . In October 1992 Arjen Lenstra and Dan Bernstein factored 2^523 - 1 into primes , using about three weeks of MasPar time . ( The MasPar is a 16384-processor SIMD machine ; each processor can add about 200000 integers per second . ) The algorithm there is called the `` number field sieve '' ; it is quite a bit faster for special numbers like 2^523 - 1 than for general numbers n , but it takes time only about exp ( O ( log^ { 1/3 } n log^ { 2/3 } log n ) ) in any case . An older and more popular method for smaller numbers is the `` multiple polynomial quadratic sieve '' , which takes time exp ( O ( log^ { 1/2 } n log^ { 1/2 } log n ) ) -- -faster than the number field sieve for small n , but slower for large n. The breakeven point is somewhere between 100 and 150 digits , depending on the implementations . Factorization is a fast-moving field -- -the state of the art just a few years ago was nowhere near as good as it is now . If no new methods are developed , then 2048-bit RSA keys will always be safe from factorization , but one ca n't predict the future . ( Before the number field sieve was found , many people conjectured that the quadratic sieve was asymptotically as fast as any factoring method could be . ) * What about other public-key cryptosystems ? We 've talked about RSA because it 's well known and easy to describe . But there are lots of other public-key systems around , many of which are faster than RSA or depend on problems more widely believed to be difficult . This has been just a brief introduction ; if you really want to learn about the many facets of public-key cryptography , consult the books and journal articles listed in part 10 .

DS > I must have missed the article on the Spagthorpe Viking . Was DS > that the one with the little illuminated Dragon 's Head on the front DS > fender , a style later copied by Indian , and the round side covers ? No . Not at all . The Viking was a trick little unit made way back when ( forties ? fifties ? ) when Spag was trying to make a go of it in racing . The first iteration ( the Springer ) was a boxer twin , very similar to Max Friz 's famous design , but with an overhead `` point cam '' ( see below for more on the valvetrain ) . The problem was that the thing had no ground clearance whatsoever . The solution was to curve the cylinder bores , so that the ground clearance was substantially increased : == @ == < -Springer motor ( front ) Viking motor ( front ) - > \= @ =/ This is roughly the idea , except that the bores were gradually curved around a radius , as the pistons were loath to make a sharp-angled turn in the middle of their stroke . The engine also had curved connecting rods to accomodate the stroke . The engine stuck out so far because of its revolutionary ( and still unique ) overhead cam system . Through the use of clever valve timing and and extrordinarily trick valve linkage , only a single cam lobe was required to drive both overhead valves . Just as revolutionary was the hydraulic valve actuation , which used a pressurized stream of oil to power the `` waterwheel '' which kept the lobe spinning over . One side effect that required some rather brutal engineering fixes was that until the engine 's oil pressure came up to normal , the engine 's valve timing would be more or less random , resulting in some impressive start-up valve damage . The solution was a little hand crank that pressurized the cases before you started the beast , remarkably similar to the system used in new Porsches to pressurize the oil system before the car is started ( the cage , however , uses an electric oil pump . Wimps ) . Despite this fix , the engine had a nasty propensity for explosively firing its valves into the pistons when a cylinder would temporarily lose a bit of oil pressure in a corner . The solution was to run even higher oil pressures and change the gaskets and seals regularly . This was feasible because it was a racing engine . With just a single overhead lobe , and no pushrod/shaft/chain towers because of the hydraulic system , the head of the engine came to an almost perfect point : /\ / ( ) \ < -lobe / XX \ < -complex linkage ( not shown due to valvestems - > / \ / \ complexity ) | | | | | |===| | =0= < -- -piston | Note that the tip was not truly vertical ( it was at about a 70 degree angle to the ground , and this drawing does n't show the curvature because there was none in the head itself . The bore curve would start about where the cylinder bore disappears in this diagram The effect of the pointy heads on top of a pair of gently ( pundits of the day even said sensuously ) curved cylinders was much like a pair of finned Viking horns poking out from beneath the gas tank . Thus , the name . The Vik was a moderately successful racer , lightning fast when it worked , but plagued by problems relating to its revolutionary technology . Eventually , it was dumped when Spag finally realized that racing was not where the Spagthorpe name would be made . The machines were raced for another year or two by privateers , and their fate ( approximately six Vikings were made , plus one or possibly two Springers . Confusing the issue is one old Spag staffer who swears up and down that this machine was tooled for production , and that as many as twenty or thirty machines may have come off the line . However , no modern record of a production Viking has survived , and most motorcycle historians discount this story .

The Bible is far from universally accepted . The Bible is NOT a proof of god ; it is only a proof that some people have thought that there was a god . ( Or does it prove even that ? They might have been writing it as series of fiction short-stories . As in the case of Dionetics . ) Assuming the writers believed it , the only thing it could possibly prove is that they believed it .

In other words , it does n't generally come back to the xtian god , it comes back to whether there is any god . And , in much of oriental philosophic history , it generally does n't pop up as the idea of a god so much as the question of what natural forces are and which ones are out there . From a world-wide view , human nature just makes us wonder how the universe came to be and/or what force ( s ) are currently in control . A natural tendancy to believe in `` God '' only exists in religious wishful thinking . > I said all this to make the point that Christianity is eminently > reasonable , that Divine justice is just and human nature is much > different than what atheists think it is . Whether you agree or not Xtianity is no more reasonable than most other religions , and it 's reasonableness certainly does n't merit eminence . Divine justice ... well , it only seems just to those who already believe in the divinity . First , not all atheists believe the same things about human nature . Second , whether most atheists are correct or not , YOU certainly are not correct on human nature . You are , at the least , basing your views on a completely eurocentric approach .

To draw an analogy , Norway is involved in the EEC . The USA in involved in NATO . The EEC requires certain changes in your laws . NATO requires no such changes in USA law . These laws affect citizens , and hence Norway is saying Europe is more important than , say , Norwegians having motorcycles that make over 100bhp . In the USA , we 'd likely tell the EEC to get stuffed since the EEC has no business , in our eyes , in telling us how much horsepower we can safely ride .

IMHO this whole discussion named `` Motif looks like MS-Windogs '' is totally stupid . The only thing remotely influenced here can be the Motif Window Manager , that features an arrangement of buttons and menus somewhat similiar to this of the MS-W windowmanaging agent , however its name is . But MWM is only a SMALL part of Motif , in fact , MWM and Motif can work without each other , and if one does n't like MWMs outfit for some reason , he switches to another windowmanager . All this does n't influence Motif , which is a toolkit of widgets to write applications , and this toolkit is IMHO uncomparable to MS-W , because it is much more wellorganized and features alot of goodies more than the MS-W interface . You can not say `` A Porsche looks like a VW Käfer '' ONLY because they have the wheel and the gear at the same position . Motif and MS-W are complete different worlds , only one element of the Motif world has some gear and wheel at the same position as MS-W. -- +-o-+ -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- +-o-+ | o | \\\- Brain Inside -/// | o | | o | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ | o | | o | Andre ' Beck ( ABPSoft ) mehl : Andre_Beck @ IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de | o | +-o-+ -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- +-o-+

I 'm using sliders in my XView apps , usually with editable numeric field . But I seem to have no control over the length of this field . In some apps it appears long enough to keep several characters , in some - it can not keep even the maximum value set by PANEL_MAX_VALUE ! As I understand , PANEL_VALUE_DISPLAY_LENGTH , which controls number of characters to be displayed in text items , doesn't work in the case of slider , despite the fact that < panel.h > contains the following bit : /* Panel_multiline_text_item , Panel_numeric_text_item , * Panel_slider_item and Panel_text_item attributes */ PANEL_NOTIFY_LEVEL = PANEL_ATTR ( ATTR_ENUM , 152 ) , PANEL_VALUE_DISPLAY_LENGTH = PANEL_ATTR ( ATTR_INT , 182 ) , which gives a hint that this attribute can be used for sliders . But 1 ) setting this attribute gives nothing , and 2 ) xv_get'ting this attribute gives warning : Bad attribute , and returns value 0 . Strange thing is that DEC 's port of XView gives plenty of space in a text fields , but not Sun 's Xview ...

Berkeley Lines : 53 Distribution : world NNTP-Posting-Host : gammow.berkeley.edu Here is the MacWeek article describing the DUO ram situation . ( w/o permission . I hope that is ok ) Jose Bad RAM brings some Duos down . ( random access memory boards for Apple Macintosh PowerBook Duos ) MacWEEK v7 , n7 ( Feb 15 , 1993 ) :132 . COPYRIGHT Coastal Associates Publishing L.P. 1993 By Raines Cohen Austin , Texas - Some third-party memory-expansion cards for PowerBook Duos depart from Apple specs in ways that could cause crashes , data loss and other problems . Technology Works Inc. , a RAM and network vendor based here , last week issued a warning about three problems it said it had found in Duo RAM products from some competing vendors , which it declined to identify . Other vendors and an Apple spokeswoman confirmed that the problems exist . > Self-refresh . The Duos require a kind of dynamic RAM called selfrefreshing , which can recharge itself while the system sleeps . But Technology Works said some vendors have sold Duo cards with nonselfrefreshing DRAM , which can cause the system to lose data or fail to wake from sleep . Most leading memory manufacturers include the letter V in the part number stamped on their self-refreshing chips ; nonself-refreshing chips instead have an L , according to TechWorks . The chip label , however , may not tell the whole story . Newer Technology of Wichita , Kan. , said it uses nonself-refreshing chips but adds its own circuitry to keep them refreshed while the Duo sleeps . > Speed . Some RAM-card vendors have put 80-nanosecond DRAM on Duo cards rather than the 70-nanosecond type the 230 requires , Technology Works said . However , some chips labeled as 80- or 85-nanosecond are certified by the manufacturer to run at a higher speed . Kingston Technology Corp. of Fountain Valley , Calif. , said it offers Duo RAM cards with 80-nanosecond chips , but only for the Duo 210 , which is compatible with the slower chips . > Space . Technology Works charged and Apple officials confirmed that some third-party cards are too large to fit properly , forcing the corner of the Duo keyboard up and preventing the system from starting up normally when in a Duo Dock . Lifetime Memory Products Inc. of Huntington Beach , Calif. , said it originally shipped cards with this problem but has since offered all customers free upgrades to cards that fit .

I suspect you have very limited experience -- US freeways vary dramatically , particularly between states . I can name a number of interstate highways in various parts of the country where 130 would be very optimistic in any car . I 'm not sure what you call `` quite severe '' in terms of road deviations but I suspect every single bridge junction on I84 through CT would be considered so . They 're hard to take at 85mph . That 's not the only interstate I 've seen with such deviations , but it 's one I drive frequently . Texas is pretty much an edge-case -- you ca n't assume that everywhere has roads in such good condition , such flat terrain , and such wide-open spaces . It just ai n't so . jim frost jimf @ centerline.com

From : chrstie @ ccu.umanitoba.ca ( William John M. Christie ) Subject : Re : Joystick suggestions ? Nntp-Posting-Host : varley.cc.umanitoba.ca Organization : University of Manitoba , Winnipeg , Canada Lines : 31 It depends on what you 'd like your joystick for . I 've seen Gravis joysticks at Radio Shack . They seemed flimsy and did n't fit well in my hand . I have heard on c.s.i.p.games that they do n't last well ( less than a year ) on flightsims . One redeeming feature does seem to be the ability to adjust the tension of the stick . I recently purchased a CH Flightstick . There are n't any suction cups and no tension adjusters but otherwise it seems to be an excellent joystick . I 'm currently using it for the Wing Commander series and Red Baron . Works quite well . The large base does not require a steadying hand and so leaves it free . The buttons provide good tactile response ( you can hear and feel them well ) . There are other models made by CH that can go up or down in features . For price comparison Gravis analogue joysticks sell for ~ $ 35.00 here compared to the $ 45.00 I paid for a CH Flightstick . I think the extra $ 10.00 is worth it just in feel . Best thing to do is to ask a salesperson to let you try them out or at least feel it before you buy . Just another note , analogue joysticks are best for flightsims or something that needs sensitive touch . If you 're only playing games such as Castle Wolfenstein or some other game that only uses digital input ( ie . only up , down , left , etc . instead of 'how much right ' ) you might want to look into a Gravis gamepad . They look like a Nintendo control pad but I do n't know much beyond that . -- Will Christie | AATCHOO ! | PHILOSOPHY : the principles and University of Manitoba | Uh-oh ... | science of thought and reality Winnipeg , MB , Canada | I 'm leaking | PHILOSOPHER : someone who thinks chrstie @ ccu.UManitoba.CA | brain lubricant . | they 're useful to society

From : gt4356c @ prism.gatech.EDU ( James Dean Barwick ) Subject : Re : Permanaent Swap File with DOS 6.0 dbldisk Distribution : git Organization : Georgia Institute of Technology Lines : 58 In comp.os.ms-windows.misc you write : > While reading through the DOS 6.0 book , it states that the Windows permanaent swap file will not work correctly when placed on a compressed drive . To make things compatable , > I removed my Permanent swap file before starting the upgrade . However , when all the dust settled , and I go into windows , it says that the temporary swap file is right where it always was , in the Windows directory . My question is : How come the temporary swap files works OK with a compressed drive , and the permanent one does n't ? you might want to look in windows FAQ for this one , but here is my best explanation . But I ca n't guarantee that I 'm not way off base ... The permenant swap file is read/written to by windows by talking directly to the hard disk controller card . The controller card must use the protocal set up by western digital ( or something like that ) . Windows creates a file called spart.par in your windows directory that points to that file . It then uses the physical information about your disk to index to information in that file . compressed disks are actually `` logical '' disks . These disks have different characteristics than the actual physical disk . Furthermore , the information on the compressed disks must be uncompressed before it is used . ( i.e it must go through the decompression program that traps disk reads at the operating system level or the BIOS level ) . Because of this `` inbetween '' program , windows can not use direct methods to read from the `` logical '' disk . a permenant swap file is only there to `` reserve '' an area of the disk that windows can use and to block that space from DOS . Windows would theoretically not even have to access the file from DOS to use that disk space . ( I don't know if it does or does n't ... but it checks for it somewhere everytime you boot windows . ) a temporary swap file is just a normal DOS file that is accessed by windows via DOS and the BIOS . If a disk compression program or other TSR is loaded the file access must go through DOS ... TSR 'S ( disk compression ) ... and BIOS in order to be access . ( i.e . NEVER USE A TEMPORARY SWAP FILE ... NEVER ) more on permenent swap files ... i 'm sure everyone who has an uncompressed part of their compressed hard disk has seen the message `` you have selected a swap file greater than the suggested size ... windows will only use the size suggested ... do you wa n't to create this swap file anyway '' or something like that . well , a friend of mine ( ROBERT ) called microsoft and asked them what and why . what they said is that windows checks the amount of free disk space and divides that number by 2 . Then it checks for the largest contiguous block of free disk space . Windows then suggests the smaller of the two numbers . They also said that under absolutely no circumstances ... NONE ! ... will windows uses a swap file larger than the suggested size . Well ... that 's what he said ! I call bull @ # $ # . If this is true why does windows report the memory is available to me if it 's not going to use it ? any takers ? James ( if this does n't get to the net , will someone post it for me ? thanks )

I refer you to the bonobos , a species of primate as closeley related to humans as chimpanzees ( that is , very closely ) . They have sex all the time , homosexual as well as heterosexual . When the group finds food , they have sex . Before the go to sleep at night , they have sex . After they escape from or fight off prdators , they have sex . Sex serves a very important social function above and beyond reproduction in this species . A species closely related to humans . There is some indication that sex performs a social function in humans , as well , but even if not , this shows that such a function is not *impossible* .

The Clinton administration nor any other government agency has any legitimate role whatsoever in regulating cryptography .

I am outraged that my tax money is being used to develop technology to restrict my freedoms far beyond reasonable measures .

The administration does not seem to understand that they are merely a subservient instrument to implement the will of the public , and hence anyone involved in this proposal in this respect is wholly negligent and remiss in performing their lawful duty . > While encryption > technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the > unauthorized release of personal information , it also can be used > by terrorists , drug dealers , and other criminals . It seems to me that U.S . Diplomatic communications should be tappable by the U.N. whenever any countries produce a warrant to the U.N . In fact , I think we should stop paying the NSA billions of dollars a year to produce unbreakable codes for this reason . These actions violate the sovereignity of international law . ( I hope Mr. Clinton is shrewd enough to recognize my sarcasm and satire here . But if he is n't , it 's a modest and reasonable proposal , so he should find merit with it nevertheless . ) Cryptography is neutral technology . If everybody has strong cryptography ( including policemen , bureacrats , businessmen , housewives , thugs and hoodlums ) , we have a sustainable equilibrium . Anything less is an unworkable anti-egaltarian arrangement , intrinsically antithetical to American freedoms , and guaranteed to collapse under its own weight of inherent impracticality . We do n't need to compromise on issues of freedom . > For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our > private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the > tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of > protecting Americans .

It is not possible for the Federal Government to `` act quickly '' or develop `` consistent , comprehensive policies '' PERIOD . And even if by some grandiose miracle such a thing were possible , it would only be an efficient way to deprive American citizens of fundamental and inalienable rights . The administration has to be committed to leaving private industries alone , esp . on this issue . The government has no legitimate role in regulating the content of communications . Law enforcement agencies must be prepared to forfeit their surveillance bludgeon ; they are soon and inevitably to be disarmed of it . > Q : If the Administration were unable to find a technological > solution like the one proposed , would the Administration be > willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more > powerful encryption devices ? No such laws can be constitutionally sound , and this is equivalent to a veiled threat , which I do n't appreciate . This kind of extortion tends to agitate me and others into radicalism . I will trade threats for threats , and violation for violation . > The Administration is not saying , `` since encryption > threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement , > we will prohibit it outright '' ( as some countries have > effectively done ) ; If the administration did say this , it would find itself impeached for reckless and outrageous disregard of essential , established , entrenched , and explicit constitutional privacy guarantees . The administration would have no legal standing whatsoever ; such an action would be egregiously illegal and criminal , and wholly untolerated and disregarded by vast segments of the population . > nor is the U.S. saying that `` every > American , as a matter of right , is entitled to an > unbreakable commercial encryption product . '' The U.S. , comprised of a vast majority of people fanatically committed to preserving their privacy in the face of an increasingly totalitarian government , is saying just that . Take your chips and give them to NSA employees as Christmas bonuses . We can run any algorithm on our computers we damn well please , and we will make any chips we please , and we will send any bit pattern over our data highways we please . And if you try to stop us , you will be gradually or abruptly dissolved into nothingness . [ privacy vs. law enforcement ] > There is a > false `` tension '' created in the assessment that this issue is > an `` either-or '' proposition . This is an outright Dingaling Denning lie . The two aims of privacy and surveillance are intrinsically and fundamentally incompatible , and you have to work for the NSA to think otherwise . Americans are about to discover ways , through the use of technology , to preserve their inalienable but forgotten freedoms that have slowly been eroded away by an increasingly distant and unresponsive and *unrepresentative* government . -- ld231782 @ longs.LANCE.ColoState.EDU

Subject : Black Screen of Death , Windows , Novell From : psweeney @ miavx1.acs.muohio.edu Organization : Miami University Academic Computer Service '' Lines : 23 Hi there , We are running a 120 node Token ring with Windows 3.1 and Novell 3.11 . Every once in a while , we run into `` The Black Screen of Death '' , a phrase coined by Robert X. Cringely in a recent InfoWorld column . Basically , sometimes when you quit Windows , the screen goes black and you get a nice little flashing cursor in the top left corner of your screen . Also , sometimes when you exit to DOS , the same effect occurs . Cringely hints that Microsoft and/or Novell has a patch for Windows' virtual interrupt controller that may solve this . Neither company seems to know what I am talking about when I call them . Has anyone else noticed this phenomenon ? Is there a fix for it ? Any response is welcome .

I have several friends at the Moscow Aviation Institute who have asked me to post this announcement . ( I have done some editing , but the contents is unchanged from the original announcement . ) For those of you not familiar with the Moscow Aviation Institute , it is the leading Russian school of higher education dedicated to the training of aircraft and spacecraft designers . It specializes in airframe design , powerplant design , control systems , and power systems . Virtually all of the major former Soviet airframe designers ( Tupolev , Su , Iluchine , Migoyan , etc . ) were schooled at MAI . I had the opportunity to tour the two museums that are maintained at MAI . The aircraft include Mig23 , Su 27 , Yak 38 , the cockpit of an F-111 ( ! ) , among others . It was a fascinating and eye opening experience , expecially given the fact that the museum was , until a year or so ago , closed to virtually everyone . I also had the opportunity to see some of the experiments being conducted with plasma drive engines for future space craft use .

I assume p is the semi-major axis and e the eccentricity . The peri- helion and aphelion are then given by p ( 1-e ) and p ( 1+e ) , i.e. , about 2.90 and 3.95 AU respectively . For Jupiter , they are 4.95 and 5.45 AU . If 1977 was after the temporary capture , this means that the comet ended up in an orbit that comes no closer than 1 AU to Jupiter 's -- which I take to be a rough indication of how far from Jupiter it could get under Jupiter 's influence . > Also , perihelions of Gehrels3 were : > > April 1973 83 jupiter radii > August 1970 ~3 jupiter radii Where 1 Jupiter radius = 71,000 km = 44,000 mi = 0.0005 AU .

The church is to last for all time . However , there are those who use the church to bolster themselves . This is evident in many letters . For instance , Paul talks about the '' super-apostles '' to the Corinthians ( 2 Corinthians 11-12 ) , he mentions how people will be led away by miracles , signs , and wonders ( 2 Thessalonians 2:9-12 ) , he tells Timothy that it is clear that some will abandon the faith and teach lies ( 1 Timothy 4:1-3 ) and that some will search for teachers to suit what they want to hear ( 2 Timothy 4:3-4 ) . Such passages go throughout the letters and Jesus does warn about them ( Matthew 24:4-14 ) . But look at the promise in this last part . Verse 14 : `` And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations , and then the end will come . '' Even today , there are false teachings . I can name two which I am well familiar with : the non-need of baptism and the `` praying of Jesus into your life for salvation '' . Both are taught . Both are DEAD wrong . They have been taken out of context from some verses , interpreted from others , and just plain made up . The ONLY way Jesus taught is given in Luke 9:23-26 and Luke 14:25-33 . He then commands baptism in Matthew 28:18-20 . The church Jesus founded , though , is alive and well .

If this were so , knife attacks in cities where guns were widely used in homicide would be expected to show a low fatality rate , and knife attacks in cities where guns were not so widely used ( like Vancouver ) would show a higher fatality rate . But the Nat ' l Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence Task Force analyzed the data and found this not to be the case . It appeared to them that as the number of knife attacks increased in relation to the number of firearms attacks ( which presumably happened where guns were less available to assailants ) , the proportion of FATAL knife attacks did NOT increase relative to the proportion of gun attacks . In fact , the reverse was true . What was found was that most homicides did not show a determination on the part of the assailant to kill . Fatalities caused by knife tended to show a single-mindedness on the part of the assailant to do grave physical injury : multiple stabs wounds , wounds concentrated about the head neck and chest , etc . Most gun homicides did not show this pattern . Rather , more fatal attacks were committed during a moment of rage and not the focused intent to kill the victim .

England has essentially legalized drugs , : so there are no drug gangs battling for turf , etc. , there . If you drop out the : drug related killings here , the USA would look a whole lot more peaceful . There are a lot of factors which make a difference . Actually , I 'm not fond of making ANY kind of social parallels between Europeans and Americans . There are more cultural , beahvioral and economic differences between us than similarities . I just sort of found myself backed into that corner over the last couple of weeks . I do n't think we could ever attain the low levels of European violent crime here in the US , whether we banned guns or required every law-abiding citizen to carry a loaded Uzi . On the other hand , we can draw lessons from neighbors who are more culturally similar , namely the Canadians . In fact , an exhaustive , seven-year study has already been done of the respective crime rates of Vancouver , British Columbia and Seattle , Washington ... cities with roughly the same population , urban economy , geography and crime but with decidedly different approaches to gun control . In Seattle , handguns may be purchased legally for self-defense . After a 30-day waiting period , a permit can be obtained to carry a concealed weapon . The recreational use of handguns is minimally restricted . In Vancouver , self-defense is not considered a valid or legal reason to purchase a handgun . Concealed weapons are not permitted . Recreational uses of handguns ( target shooting , collecting ) are regulated by the province . Purchase of a handgun requires a restricted-weapons permit . A permit to carry may be obtained in order to transport the weapon to licensed shooting clubs . Handguns transported by vehicle must be stored in the trunk in a locked box . In short , gun control but not unreasonably so . Both cities aggressively enforce their gun laws . Convictions for gun-related offenses carry similar penalties . The researchers studied all cases of robbery , assault ( simple and aggravated ) , burglary and homicides occurring in Seattle and Vancouver from 1/1/80 to 12/31/86 . In defining the cases , they used the same standard : the FBI 's Unified Crime Report . Results : during the seven-year study the annual rate of robbery in Seattle was found to be only slightly higher than that in Vancouver ( 1.09 / 1.11 ) . Burglaries occurred at nearly identical rates ( .99 ) . 18,925 assaults were recorded in Seattle versus 12,034 in Vancouver . The risk of being a victim of a simple assault in Seattle was found to be only slightly higher than Vancouver ( 1.18 / 1.15 ) and the risk of aggravated assault was also slightly higher ( 1.16 / 1.12 ) . However , when aggravated assaults were subdivided by weapon and the mechanism of assault , a clear pattern emerged . Although both cities reported nearly identical rates of aggravated assault involving knives and other dangerous weapons , firearms were far more likely to be used in Seattle . In fact , 7.7 times as often . Over the seven-year study , 388 homicides occurred in Seattle ( 11.3 per 100,000 ) vs. 204 homicides in Vancouver ( 6.9 per 100,000 ) . After adjustment for differences in age and sex among the populations , the relative risk of being a victim of homicide in Seattle , as compared to Vancouver , was found to be 1.63 . When homicides were subdivided by the mechanism of death , the rate of homicide by knives and other weapons ( excluding firearms ) in Seattle was found to be almost identical to that in Vancouver . Virtually ALL of the increased risk of death in Seattle was due to a more than fivefold higher rate of homicide by firearms . Handguns accounted for roughly 85 % of homicides involving firearms . Handguns were 4.8 times more likely to be used in homicides in Seattle than in Vancouver . The authors of the report also investigated `` legally justifiable '' homicides ( self-defense ) . Only 32 such homicides occurred during the seven-year study , 11 of which were committed by police . Only 21 cases of civilians acting in self-defense occurrred : 17 in Seattle and 4 in Vancouver . Only 13 involved firearms . After excluding these cases , there was virtually no impact on these earlier findings . -- -- -- - This is , I feel , a very fair report . One might even make the argument that it is biased against Canada as a whole because Vancouver reports annual rates of homicide two to three times that of Ottawa , Calgary and Toronto while Seattle reports annual homicide rates only half to two-thirds that of NYC , Chicago , Los Angeles and Houston . Critics of handgun control always argue that limited legal access to handguns will have little effect on the rates of homicide because persons intent on killing others will only try harder to acquire a gun or will kill by other means . This report shows differently . If the rate of homicide in a community were influenced more by the strength of intent than by the availability of weapons , we could expect the rate of homicides by weapons other than guns to be higher in Vancouver than in Seattle . However , during the study interval , Vancouver 's rate of homicide by weapons other than guns was not significantly higher than that in Seattle , suggesting that few would-be assailants switched to homicide by other methods . As well , ready access to handguns for self-defense by law-abiding citizens was not endorsed in this report . Although Seattle did experience a higher rate of firearm death for self-defense , these cases accounted for less than 4 % of the homicides in both cities during the course of the study period . And , as was reported , Seattle apparently did n't enjoy relief from any crime category over Vancouver because citizens may legally arm themselves for self-defense .

Keywords : science errors Turpin Organization : University of Hawaii ( Mathematics Dept ) Expires : Mon , 10 May 1993 10:00:00 GMT Lines : 80 Avoiding mistakes is certainly highly desirable . However it is also widely acknowledged that perfectionism is inimicable to creativity . And in ordinary life , perfectionism carried beyond a certain point is indicative of a psychological disorder . In the extreme case , a perfectionist becomes so paralyzed by all the possible mistakes he might make that he is unable to even leave the house . In science , we want to discover as much truth about the world as possible and we also want to have as much certainty as possible about these discoveries . Usually there is some trade-off between these two desiderata -- - the search for scope and the search for certainty . If 18th century mathematicians had demanded total rigor from Newton and Leibniz then there would probably be no calculus today , because neither of the two could explain calculus in a way that really made sense , since they lacked the concept of a limit . And in fact , because of the lack of a rigorous foundation , they made a number of errors in their use of calculus . It was only a hundred years later that Weistrass was able to give a solid grounding for the ideas of Newton and Leibniz . Nonetheless , what Newton and Leibniz did was undoubtedly science and mathematics gained a great deal more from the application of their important ideas than it lost through the mistakes they made .

These are not the rules according to many who post to sci.med and sci.psychology . According to these posters `` If it 's not supported by carefully designed controlled studies then it 's not science . '' Taken to the extreme , I believe that the attitude that empirical studies are everything and ideas are nothing results in a complete stultification of science . For one thing , an insistence on an elaborate and expensive methodology results in a sort of scientific trade-unionism , where those outside the establishment and lacking institutional or corporate support have no chance to obtain a hearing . ( I do n't in the least believe that this is the intention of the arbiters of scientific methodology . Nonetheless , it is one of the results . ) And although institutional science has certainly produced many wonderful results , I think it is a foolish arrogance for scientists to believe that no one outside the establishment -- - and using less than perfect empirical methodology -- - will ever come with anything worthwhile . Furthermore , the big bucks approach to science promotes what I think is one of the most significant errors in science : choosing to investigate questions because they can be readily handled by the currently fashionable methodology ( or because one can readily get institutional or corporate sponsorship for them ) instead of directing attention to those questions which seem to have fundamental significance . For instance , certain questions can not be easily investigated with statistical methods because the relevant factors are not quantitative . ( One could argue that this is the case for almost all questions in many areas of psychology . In my opinion , a perusal of many of the papers resulting from the attempt by psychologists to force these questions into a statistical framework gives the lie to Russell Turpin's assertion that current scientific methods `` avoid all known errors . '' ) I think that asking the wrong question is probably the most fundamental error in science . ( Ignoring potentially valuable ideas is one of the others . ) And I think that scientific journals are full of all too many studies done with impeccable empirical methods but which are worthless because the wrong question was asked in the first place . -- In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists , psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects . lady @ uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu lady @ uhunix.bitnet

Stop ! Hold it ! You have a few problems here . Official history says that the first accusations of homosexuality in the SA came from OUTSIDE of the Nazi party , long BEFORE the Nazis ever came to power . So this objection is a red herring , even if established history is wrong on this point . Moreover , none of the histories I 've read ever made mention of Hitler or anyone else ever using homosexuality as a pretext for purging Roehm . A point I saw reiterated was that Hitler and the party covered up these accusations . If you are going to accuse official history of being a fabrication , you should at least get your facts right . The pretext for purging Roehm was that he was planning to use the SA in a coup against Hitler . Nowhere is there mention of using allegations of homosexuality as a pretext for the purge , nor as a justification afterwards ( it is possible that the histories I 've read have not mentioned this , but I doubt it - would it be in Hitler 's best interest to admit to the world that his former right hand man was a homosexual ? ) . Anyway , as I said before , it is always possible that I have missed references to the Nazis making use of charges of homosexuality against the SA after the night of the long knives - but this does not prove that they were false . Even the Nazis could tell the truth when it was to their advantage . In any case , this does not deal with accusations of homosexuality in the SA during the 1920 's . > Since the accusers thereafter controlled the records , > anything bearing on the subject -- true or not -- has to be considered > tainted evidence . Ah , yes . I forgot this was being posted to alt.conspiracy . I can smell the paranoia from here . Since the Nazis never officially charged Roehm with homosexuality ( at least , not according to what I 've read ) , I 'd like to know what tainted `` evidence '' you are talking about . Since the accusations were made by persons outside of the Nazi party , long before it came to power , and those accusations were common knowledge to journalists and others in Germany in the 1920 's and 30 's , just how would it be possible for the Nazis to go back in time and plant `` tainted '' evidence ? How exactly does one doctor newspapers which were circulated around the world , without the discrepancies being obvious ? What actual incidences of Nazi doctoring evidence on this matter do you know about ? And what about the testimony of people who were involved in these matters , some of whom were not Nazis ? And what is the point of making a false accusation of homosexuality if you do not publicize it ? Since the point here seems to be to discredit established history , then the burden of proof falls on the revisionist . The revisionists had better do their homework before making accusations . Otherwise they simply look like conspiracy nuts . > The available data suggest that Roehm and his crowd , > the SA -- Sturmabteilung , `` Storm Troopers '' -- left the world a better > place when they departed , This is just about the *only* thing we agree on . I suspect that the notion that there might have been bad people - Roehm and his SA buddies - who were homosexuals must disturb some people . The feeling seems to be that if a nasty individual is accused of homosexuality , that this must be an attempt to bash homosexuals . This fear - often justified - is what lies behind this distrust of official history , or so it seems to me . But this is not a good justification for trashing accepted accounts of this subject . If you really think that historians are so incompetent , why do n't you write them and ask where they got their sources on this subject , if you ca n't tell from their footnotes ? I 'm a graduate student in history . Writing to professors and tracking down sources is old hat . But my time is limited and this is not my specialty - and neither you nor anyone else have said anything that would cast one shred of doubt on existing evidence . I 'm not going to waste my time trying to debunk someone 's paranoia . Do the research yourself . > but concrete particulars are still no more than > more or less shrewd guesses . > -- Diccon Frankborn Given that you already consider all evidence `` tainted '' , what on earth would constitute concrete particulars ? And since when have concrete particulars been considered `` shrewd guesses '' ? I suggest that those who do not trust popular historians ( Irving et al ) - historians writing for a popular audience do not , as a rule , provide copious footnotes - should try instead reading academic historians , who usually provide footnotes to all their sources in immmense detail . This is the place to start looking . Assuming that one really wants to know the truth . I 'll bet the folks on alt.pagan are tired of this subject already .

To one brought up , as most Americans have been , in the Gladstonian and foreign-missionary tradition , the condition of the Jews in Turkey is almost a mathematical demonstration that religious differences have had an influence in the tragedy of Turkey only as they were combined with aspirations for a political separation which every nation in the world would have treated as treasonable .

E. von Grunebaum Center for Near Eastern Studies . Editor : How did you come to write these two books on Turkey and European and Turkish Jews ? Shaw : Basically , I 'm an Ottoman historian , but I 'm also Jewish . I 've spent twenty-five years studying Ottoman history , and as time went along , whenever I found materials on the Ottoman Jews , I collected them . But I never did anything with them until a couple of years ago , when I suddenly realized that 1992 was the 500th anniversary of the Jews being expelled from Spain and coming to Turkey . Then the Sephardic Temple down on Wilshire Avenue invited me to give a series of three lectures on Ottoman Jewry . These lectures were greatly appreciated , and I became motivated to undertake further research to develop a book , The Jews of the Ottoman Empire and the Turkish ) Republic . This book is quite different from the works of most Jewish historians , who tend to look at the Jews in any country more from the viewpoint of the Jews and the Jewish community , and rely mainly on Jewish sources . I view my subject as an Ottoman historian , and I approach the Jews of the Ottoman Empire largely from the point of view of Ottoman society , using largely Ottoman sources . After I finished this book and sent it to the press , I came across additional documents relating to Turkish Jews during World War II . In the completed book , I had said that Turkey had done a good deal to rescue the Jews during World War II , but I did not actually have many details . Then I found a batch of documents in the Foreign Ministry archive relating to actions taken by Turkish diplomats to help the Jews before and during the Holocaust . It was too late to add this new information to the book in press , so I decided to write a second book . I conducted further research , mainly in the archives of the Foreign Ministry in Ankara and the Turkish Embassy and Consulate in Paris . The result was the second book , Turkey and the Holocaust , which details how Turkey helped rescue Jews from the Nazis . - How exactly did they do this ? The story takes place over a number of years . The book presents the material in three parts , first of which deals with the period before the Holocaust . When the Nazis came to power in Germany in 1933 , they immediately started dismissing Jews and anti-Nazi Germans from universities , hospitals , scientific institutes , and the like . Turkey at that moment was just beginning the process of reforming its universities , and it saw in these Jews , who were being fired from their positions in Germany , a good source of new talent to help modernize the Turkish universities . Within three months after the Nazis started dismissing these Jews , Turkey arranged to take many of them in . They were brought to Turkey and were given appointments as professors in the Turkish universities , as heads of scientific institutes , and as medical personnel in hospitals . About 300 to 500 major Jewish professors came to Turkey in the 1930s . Ernst Reuter , a German political scientist , spent the war years teaching political science in Turkey . After World War II , he was mayor of Berlin during the Berlin Airlift . Fritz Neimark , a major German Jewish economist , came to Turkey and helped establish a modern school of economics in Istanbul . A man named Reichenbach , who was rescued from the Nazis by Turkey and spent the war years in Turkey , eventually came to UCLA , where he became a professor of philosophy . Other German Jewish emigres engaged in cultural activities in Turkey . One such was Karl Ebert , who had been a leading theatrical producer in Berlin until he was expelled by the Nazis . He went to Turkey , where he organized the Turkish National Theater and the Turkish National Opera Company in Ankara , with the help of Paul Hindemuth . So the first section of the book covers this first phase , when Jews were being persecuted in Germany and rescued by Turkey . Oddly enough , the German emigres , when they were in Turkey , did not seem to think too badly of Germany . They regarded themselves more as Germans than Jews , and they did not join in the anti-Nazi activities of the local Turkish Jewish community . I even found letters from the Nazi representatives to Turkey praising these German Jewish refugees for their work in promoting the idea of German culture . Even though these people had been persecuted by the Nazis and rescued by the Turks , they shared the Nazis ' feelings of Aryan racial superiority over the Turks . The second part of the book deals with the Holocaust , which began in 1940 when the Nazis occupied France . In Europe at that time , and especially in France , there were about 20,000 Turkish Jews . They had migrated to Europe for various reasons from about the turn of the century onward . Most of them had settled in Europe during the Turkish war for independence after World War I , when Greece was threatening to overrun Turkey . The Greeks had persecuted the Jews throughout the nineteenth century , and the Jews feared what might happen to them if the Greeks took over in Turkey . Many Jews fled to France during the 1920s and 1930s . Many also abandoned their Turkish citizenship and became French citizens . Suddenly the Nazis invaded France in 1940 and started introducing all sorts of anti-Jewish laws . The Turkish Jews soon found that it was not worth very much to be a French Jew , but that it was worth a lot to be a Turkish Jew . - How so ? Turkey remained neutral through most of World War II . It retained its embassies and consulates in all the Nazi-occupied countries until it finally entered the war on the side of the Allies at the end of 1944 . During the war , therefore , Turkey was in a position to defend its citizens against anti-Jewish measures , and the actions that Turkish diplomats took form the second chapter of the book . Turkish diplomats who were stationed in France in particular intervened to protect Jews of Turkish citizenship from the Nazis . For those Turkish Jews who had retained their Turkish citizenship , there was generally no problem . If they were arrested and sent to a concentration camp , the Turkish diplomats would communicate with the commanders of the camp and other officials and say in effect : `` These people are Turkish citizens . You ca n't do this to them . '' And the Turkish Jews would be released . If their businesses were confiscated , the Turkish diplomats would protest and the businesses would be restored . The Nazis in general wanted to keep the friendship of Turkey . They hoped to be able to use Turkey as a gateway for an invasion of the Middle East , and they also wanted to obtain chromium and manganese from Turkey . In order to keep Turkish friendship , they usually accepted these interventions on behalf of Turkish Jews . The Turkish diplomats sometimes went to the concentration camps to secure the release of Turkish Jews . At times they even boarded trains hauling Turkish Jews to Auschwitz for extermination and succeeded in getting them off the train . Most of the foreign Jews were sent to a concentration camp at a place called Drancy in Paris , and that 's where most of the intercession by Turkish consuls took place . The greater problem came with the Turkish Jews who had abandoned their Turkish citizenship and had become French citizens . The consuls could n't declare that these people were Turkish citizens because they were not . My book includes photographs of Jews lining up in front of the Turkish consulate , either to get passports to return to Turkey or to get a restoration of their Turkish citizenship . This was a bureaucratic matter , so processing the application would take some time . In the meantime it was a real emergency , because the Nazis would arrest Jews on the streets for almost nothing . The Nazis would even arrest them if they had radios or telephones in their apartments , because radios and telephones were forbidden to Jews . To take care of these former Turkish Jews , the Turkish diplomats invented a document called gayri muntazem vatandash , or `` irregular fellow citizen . '' The document said in effect `` This person is a former Turkish citizen who has applied for the restoration of his Turkish citizenship . In the meantime we would appreciate it if you would treat him as if he were a Turkish citizen . '' The diplomats wrote the document in Turkish and put their seals on it . Since the Nazis could not read Turkish , on the whole they accepted these papers as certificates of citizenship . By this means , the Turkish diplomats were able to rescue many Jews who had relinquished their Turkish citizenship . Actually the Nazis were of two minds about the Turkish defense of Jews . On the one hand the Nazi Foreign Ministry , which wanted to retain the friendship of Turkey , was in favor of accepting these interventions . On the other hand , Himmler and Eichmann wanted all Jews exterminated . At times Himmler and Eichmann were able to prevail and some of the Turkish Jews were sent off to Auschwitz before the Turkish consuls could do anything . - Do you have statistics on how many Turkish Jews were rescued ? There were about 20,000 Turkish Jews in Europe before world War II , about 10,000 of whom were living in France . Most of the information in this section of the book relates to the situation in France . I have published the letters that the Turkish consuls sent to the Nazi officials and the letters that came back in reply . Generally the Nazis said that if the Turkish consul would present documents certifying that arrested individuals are Turkish citizens , and promise to send them out of France , the Nazis would release them from the concentration camp . The Turkish consuls also organized special trains to take Turkish Jews from Nazi-occupied territory back to Turkey . These trains ran regularly in 1943 and 1944 . The Nazis gave the Turkish Jews visas so they could pass out of Nazi territory , but the trains were often held up by the Nazi-influenced governments of Eastern Europe - Croatia , Serbia , and Bulgaria - because these governments really did n't want the Jews to escape . As a result of the Turkish consuls ' efforts , about 3,000 to 4,000 of the Turkish Jews in France were saved . Another 3,000 were sent off to Auschwitz , where most of them died . The remaining 3,000 either escaped across the border into Spain or fled to the area of southern France occupied by the Italians , who treated Jews much better than the Nazis did . At the end of 1943 , however , Italy fell out of the war , and that was the end for those Jews as well . Incidentally , the Turkish diplomats in Nazi-occupied Greece also worked to rescue Jews in that country . - The second part of your book then deals with Turkish diplomats acting to rescue Jews of Turkish citizenship or Turkish origin from Nazi persecution . Yes , and there is an aside I might add here : In their interventions on behalf of Turkish Jews , the Turks cited their treaty with Germany which stated that Turkish citizens in German territory would be treated the same as German citizens in Turkey . On that basis the Turks maintained that the Nazis could not discriminate against Turkish citizens who are Jews . The Nazis claimed ( and the Vichy government agreed ) that they were not discriminating because they were treating all Jews equally . Turkey protested , saying , `` You are dividing our citizens according to religion , but the Turkish constitution requires that all citizens be treated equally , regardless of religion . Therefore , you can not single out Turkish Jews . '' American consuls in Paris , by contrast , accepted the Nazi argument and told American Jews who were being persecuted by the Nazis that they could n't do anything about it , because the American Jews were being treated the same as other Jews . The third part of the book takes place in Turkey , which was the principal center during the Holocaust for activities aimed at the rescue of Eastern European Jews . The kwish Agency , an organization established by Jews in Palestine to help resettle Jews to Palestine , set up an office in Istanbul in 1940 under the leadership of Chaim Barlas . Other Jewish organizations in Palestine , especially the kibbutzes , also sent representatives to Istanbul to set up headquarters . These groups first tried to contact Jews in Eastern Europe to find out what was happening . Today we know about the Holocaust , but at that time people did n't know what was going on . They didn't imagine the Nazis could do the things they were doing . And so the first step was to get information , and the Turkish government let them use the Turkish mails to send letters to their relatives and friends in Eastern Europe . The Jewish organizations found out what was happening when they received replies . Later on when the Nazis began to intercept such letters , the Jews received assistance also from the Vatican nuncio , Angelo Roncali , who served as the Vatican representative in Istanbul from 1935 to 1944 and later became Pope John XXIII . As the Vatican representative during the war , he used the facilities of the Catholic Church to supplement what the Turkish government was doing to assist Jewish agencies in contacting Jews in Eastern Europe . With the cooperation of the Turkish government , these agencies then sent hard currency , food , clothing , and even railroad and steamship tickets to Jews in Czechoslovakia , Bulgaria , Romania , and Hungary . They were n't able to help much in Poland because by then the Nazis had wiped out almost all the Polish Jews . Whenever possible the rescue agencies arranged for the Jews to get out of Eastern Europe either by train through the so called Orient Express route to Istanbul , or by boat through the Black Sea to Istanbul . Turkey was not eager for all these refugees to remain within its borders during the war , because it was being blockaded and was suffering terrible shortages of food and clothing . The government , therefore , facilitated the movement of the non-Turkish Jewish refugees from Turkey to Palestine , either by the Taurus Express Railroad through the mountains to Syria and Palestine , or by small boats across the eastern Mediterranean from southern Turkey to Palestine . These efforts were bitterly opposed not only by the Nazis , but also by the British , who did not want any more Jewish immigration to Palestine because they feared it would hurt their relations with the Arabs . The British constantly pressured the Turkish government to stop this traffic and send those Jews back . In a few cases the Turkish government , yielding to British pressure , did send the boats back . For example , in one incident , the steamship Struma , with some 700 Jewish refugees from Romania , was sent back by the Turkish government as a result of the intervention of the British ambassador . When that ship was sunk by a Soviet submarine , all were lost except one person . Nevertheless , all told , the Turkish government allowed no fewer than 100,000 Eastern European Jews to pass through Turkish territory and move on to Palestine during the Second World War . The Turkish authorities also provided these refugees with facilities and money , and gave them permission to send money and food out of the country . - Many of these Jews who passed through Turkey may still be living in Israel . Yes , and their children . But let 's return for a moment to the first group , the Turkish Jews who came from Europe . They did not go on to Palestine ; they stayed in Turkey . It was the non-Turkish , Eastern European Jews who passed through Turkey en route to Palestine . Their story is very interesting . - And you have rescued it from obscurity . Many studies have been made of the Holocaust , but most of them do not focus on the Eastern European or Middle Eastern Jews . Most of the scholarship has centered on the Western European Jews , of whom 6 million were massacred by the Nazis . My study deals with a much smaller number of people . I have tried to round out the picture , and I hope my book will persuade other scholars to undertake further investigations in the history of Eastern Jews . When it comes to numbers , the German Jews were also relatively small in number . Most of the millions slain were Polish Jews . The rescue of 100,000 Eastern European Jews may not seem so significant compared with the total of 6 million who were murdered , but it meant a lot to those who were saved . About three-fourths of the book consists of documents - translations of many documents . They are included because the story is not well known . Not only are people in the West unaware of the courageous actions of the Turkish diplomats ; even the people of Turkey did not know the story . I felt that they would not fully understand this remarkable achievement unless they could see the documents . - What languages are used in the documents ? Most of them are in Turkish or French ; some are in Hebrew . There is a great deal of material in Hebrew about the organization of the boats going to Palestine , the passengers , and so on , but I did not go into those details extensively . I describe mostly what Turkey did , so most of my documents are in Turkish or French . A few documents are in English . The Jewish groups in Istanbul did not necessarily cooperate with one another to rescue Jews ; in fact , they often fought with one another . They took turns trying to get the Turkish government to deport rival groups . For example , some of the kibbutz groups felt that the Jewish Agency was run by Western European Jews who were interested only in helping Western European Jews . Finally , in 1944 , President Roosevelt sent a personal representative , Ira Hirschman , who had been an executive of Bloomingdale 's department store in New York City , and Hirschman managed to reconcile their differences . The documents related to his mission are in English . I also obtained many documents from Serge Klarsfeld , a Holocaust historian in France , who mainly worked on the French Jews . ( His father was killed by the Nazis . ) He gave me materials he had gathered in the German archives on the Turkish Jews , so I didn't personally consult the German archives . I believe that much more can be learned from the German archives , and I hope someone someday will make the effort . - This new book fits in well with your teaching , does n't it ? Right . I 'm giving a course on the history of the Jews of the Ottoman Empire . I first gave the course two years ago . In addition to research , writing , and teaching , I 've been actively involved in the commemoration of the 500th anniversary of the coming of the Jews to the Ottoman Empire . Among other things , I helped organize a large international conference on the subject which was held in Istanbul in 1992 . - Now that your books are finished and the conference has taken place , what do you plan to do next ? I 'm working on two new books . One is a history of the Turkish War for Independence , which took place after World War I , during the years 1918 to 1923 . The Turks warded off the efforts of the victorious European powers to occupy Turkey and end its independence . The second book is a study of Sultan Abdul Hamid II , the last major sultan , who ruled from 1876 to 1909 . He was an important modernizer in his own way , although he also suppressed all sorts of political movements . Stanford J. Shaw received a B.A . in History and an M.A . in British History . He then shifted to Near Eastern History , earning a second M.A . and a Ph.D. at Princeton . As a doctoral candidate at Princeton , he spent two years abroad , studying at the School of Oriental and African Studies , University of London ; the University of Cairo , the American University at Cairo , and the University of Istanbul . He taught at Harvard before coming to UCLA in 1966 . His postdoctoral research has been supported by the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation , the American Research Institute in Turkey , the Social Science Research Council , the National Endowment for the Humanities , the Fulbright Program , and ISOP . He has received honorary degrees from Harvard University and Bosporus University , Bebek , Istanbul , Turkey , and medals of honor for lifetime contributions to the fields of Islamic and Turkish studies from the Center for Research in Islamic History , Art , and Culture in Istanbul and from the American Friends of Turkey in Washington , D.C . In addition to undertaking many professional service activities and public lectures in both the United States and Turkey , Shaw has also produced eight books and one edited volume . His History of the Ottoman Empire and Modem Turkey ( 2 vols . ) has been published in many editions ( six editions or reprints from 1977-1991 ) , and translated into Turkish ( 1983 , 1991 ) and French ( 1984 ) . His book The Jews of the Ottoman Empire and the Turkish Republic ( MacMillan , London , and New York University Press , 1992 ) will be published in Turkish translation by the Turkish Historical Society , Istanbul . His Turkey and the Holocaust : Turkey 's Role in Rescuing Turkish and European Jewry from Nazi Persecution , 1933-1945 will be published by Macmillan Publishers , London , and New York University Press in 1993 . A pamphlet summarizing the book was published in Ankara , Turkey , in 1992 . Serdar Argic 'We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the Turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination .

I am sick and tired of this 'DRIVING THE JEWS INTO THE SEA ' sentance attributed to Islamic movements and the PLO ; it simply ca n't be proven as part of their plan ! ( Pro Israeli activists repeat it like parrots without checking its authenticity since it was coined by Bnai Brith ) What Hamas and Islamic Jihad believe in , as far as I can get from the Arab media , is an Islamic state that protects the rights of all its inhabitants under Koranic Law . This would be a reversal of the 1948 situation in which the Jews in Palestine took control of the land and its ( mostly Muslim ) inhabitants . However , whoever committed crimes against humanity ( torture , blowing up their homes , murders , ... ) must be treated and tried as a war criminal . The political thought of these movements shows that a freedom of choice will be given to the Jews in living under the new law or leaving to the destintion of their choice . As for the PLO , I am at a loss to explain what is going inside Arafat 's mind . Although their political thinking seems far fetched with Israel acting as a true super-power in the region , the Islamic movements are using the same weapon the Jews used to establish their state : Religion . Ahmed . Forget the syntax , Ahmed , and focus on the semnatics . The fact is that the PLO does not recognize Israel 's right to exist . This is perfectly obvious from the PLO covenant ( Cairo , 1968 ) . The covenant calls for the destruction of the `` Zionist entity '' . As far as I know the Israel-destruction clauses still exist in the document which specifies the purpose for the existence of the PLO . If you would like , I can post the relevant caluses . Now the Hamas ideal is far more radical , it seems . I know it has been posted here several times , and while I do not have a copy of it , I am sure that someone does and he ( or she , of course ) would be more than happy to repost it . Regardless of phrasing , groups like Hamas , and the Hezbollah , and even the newly moderate and politically-correct PLO , have at the very heart of their ideologies the need for the destrcution of Israel . It just seems to me that Mr. Davidsson 's suggestion that Jews support people envolved in these organizations is not a particularly appealing one to many Jews . Harry .

Israeli morality pales in the face of charming events like the string of PLO-run skyjackings in the mid 80 's ( remember those TWA jokes ? ) , and not to forget the Achille Lauro and however many airline bombings they have committed , not to mention bombings on the streets of Israel ( It 's gotten to a point where children are told not to go near any bags or containers whose origins they do n't know , because they could be bombs ) , or last weeks Katyusha rocket attack on Northern Israel by Fatah , those wonderful `` mainstream moderates '' with whom Israel is attempting to negotiate . Let 's not forget the fact that more Palestinians are killed by Palestinians than by Israelis . Ahh yes , those charming humanitarian death squads . I 've actually seen a videotape of an interrogation ( DSee the documentary _Deadly Currents_ -- very neutral and balanced -- seriously ) -- It was rather inquisition-esque . essentially , to prove his loyalty to `` the cause '' of whichever group it was that was interogating him , he had to turn in someone else , or else face death in one of the many fun-filled ways that the death- squads love so much -- beatings , dismemberment , acid , pouring melted plastic on the face of the 'guilty party , ' and of course beheading , always my favorite . Did you catch the photos in the Washington Post a while back the execution of a `` collaborator ? '' 3 photos : 1 ) one Palestinian leading another at gunpoint . 2 ) The `` collaborator '' on his knees , the gun pointed at his temple . 3 ) The executioner standing on the corpse of the `` collaborator shouting about how this is what happens to collaborators . Wonderful justice system , and lots of regard for Human rights . Remember Black September ? Ok , so they just tried to take over Jordan , big deal .

The University cops here ( who are > are state cops ) are armed better than the Chicago police . It seems most > state cops are . Define `` armed better '' . Go shoot a revolver and a semi-auto like the Colt .45 . Does one fires faster than the other ? Nope . Aside from which faster rate of fire is usually not desirable . Sure it makes the other guys duck for cover , but just *YOU* trying hitting anything with a Thompson in hose-mode . This is why the military is limiting it 's M-16 now to 3-round burst-fire . Simple semi-auto would be better , but the troops like to be able to rock and roll even if it is wasteful of ammo ( something often in short supply when the enemy is plentiful ) . A revolver is equally capable as a semi-auto in the same caliber . - A revolver also has the advantage that if it misfires you just pull the trigger again . - A double-action revolver ( almost all of them ) can be hand-cocked first , but will fire merely by pulling the trigger . - A misfire in a revolver merely means you must pull the trigger again to rotate to the next round . - A revolver can be carried with the 6th chamber empty and under the hammer for maximum safety , but still can be drawn and fired with an easy motion , even one handed . - Speedloaders for a revolver allow reloads almost as fast as magazines on semi-autos . Can be faster depending on users . - A misfire in a semi-auto will require you to clear a jammed shell first , time spent which can be fatal . And a vital second or so is often lost as you realize `` hey , it 's jammed ! '' before starting to do anything about clearing it . - Most semi-autos must have the slide worked to chamber the first round and cock the hammer . Some police carry their semi-autos with the chamber loaded and hammer cocked , but a safety engaged . I do not consider this safe however . You must trade-off safety to get the same speed of employment as a revolver . - There are some double-action semi-autos out there , but the complexity of operation of many of them requires more training . Some police departments switched to Glocks , and then started quietly switching many officers back to the old revolvers . Too many were having accidents , partly due to the poor training they received . Not that Glocks require rocket scientists , but some cops are baffled by something as complex as the timer on a VCR . Anyone who goes anyone saying that the criminals obviously outgun the police do n't know nothing about firearms . Turn off COPS and Hunter and pay attention . I do not seek here to say `` semi-autos are junk '' merely that assuming they are better for all jobs is stupid . A cop with a revolver on his hip and a shotgun in the rack is more than equipped for anything short of a riot . Gun control is hitting what you aim at . If you whip out a wonder-nine and fire real fast you may find you do n't hit anything . Good controlled fire from a revolver is more likely to get you a hit . I own a 9mm Beretta myself but consider it inferior as a carry weapon to something like the Ruger Security Six revolver . If I have n't hit what I 'm aiming at in the first 5 shots , something is quite seriously wrong somewheres . While I might like having the backup capacity of those extra shots in certain cases , overwhelmingly the # of shots fired in criminal encounters is less than 5 . What do crooks overwhelmingly use in crime ? Why the same nice simple .38 revolvers that the police often use . Well actually some police prefer the much heftier .357 Magnum , but anyway ... .. ObPlea : Do n't flame me , I prefer semi-autos for most things .

That does n't worry me at all ; they 're not going to cheat at something they can get caught at . And key size is one of the things that can be verified externally . Feed lots of random key/input pairs into the chip , then try flipping random key bits , and see what happens to the output . We already know what *should* happen -- about half the output bits should vary , on average , from a 1-bit key change or input change . If they were out to build a weak cryptosystem , it might be the case that some of the bits are much less powerful than others , in the sense that they only enter into the encryption very late in the game . By contrast , DES was designed to use each key bit as early as possible ; the 50 % output change rate appears as early as round 5 . Again , though , I do n't think NSA is going to cheat that crudely ; they 're likely to get caught . Remember that they 've promised to let a committee of outside experts see the cryptosystem design . If you assume something DES-like , a biased subkey generation schedule will stick out like a sore thumb . The committee can and should run lots of tests , and retain the output . This can be verified later against the chip . And yes , the civilian community has at least some secure storage facilities that I do n't think even NSA can get into without it being noticed , until Fort Meade gets its transporter working again . ( Oops -- I do n't think I was supposed to talk about that ... ) The committee members can even retain secure copies of the code -- in two halves , which you have to XOR together to recover the program ... Seriously , there are , I think , problems with this whole scheme . But the people who invented it are n't stupid , and they 've been in the crypto game and the smoke-and-mirrors game far longer than most of us . They 're not going to lie in ways that can be detected easily , since their credibility is the *only* thing they can use to sell this system . If they 've lied about the civilian committee , no one will believe them about the absence of other back doors . If they 've lied about the key size , no one will believe that they have n't copied the programming disk with the U keys . If they 've lied about obvious aspects of the strength of the cryptosystem , no one will believe the escrow agencies are n't in cahoots with them . That is n't to say that they are n't lying about all those other things anyway . And I 'm certainly not claiming that NSA ca n't build a cryptosystem with a back door that the committee ca n't find -- look how long it took for folks to believe that the S-boxes were n't sabotaged . It 's entirely possible that the committee will release an ambiguous report , for just such reasons . But that 's a subtle point ( i.e. , one you ca n't explain to a Senator ... ) . > Anyway , its looking like the > keys and escrow arrangements are smoke and mirrors to cover the way the NSA > can regenerate the key from the transmitted serial number . I do n't like the unit key generation process any better than you do . However -- S1 and S2 are supposed to be under control of the same escrow agents . If they ca n't be trusted to keep the seed values secure , they ca n't be trusted to keep the half-keys secure . I still do n't know if or when S1 and S2 change . I thought I had seen something about them being constant , but I just reread Denning 's technical information post , and it does n't say anything , one way or the other . -- Steve Bellovin

Elevated levels of Glu and Asp in the blood are able to bypass the Blood-brain barrier through the circumventricular organs ( or CVO ) , in particular the adeno and neurohypophysis ( pituitary gland ) areas . The arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus , and the median eminence regions are particularly effected . CVO areas are not subject to the blood-brain barrier . These areas control the release of gonadotropin , which controls the release and flux of steroids governing development , especially sexual development . Changes in adult rats , which are less sensitive to Glu than humans , have been observed : after ingesting Glu , on a chronic basis , cycles of several steroids are disrupted . Blood levels of somatostatin are significantly reduced , and cyclic release of steroids becomes flattened . Hope this helps . -- Dianne Murray : wcsbeau @ ccs.carleton.ca

It is very possible to connect another internal hard disk in any macintosh if you can find the space to put it . I have a IIsi that came with a Quantum 80 meg drive . When I ran into space problems , I slapped in another 40 meg quantum that I had sitting on a shelf . Here is what I did . First off , I was concerned about space . Since both drives are Quantum quarter height drives , I finally decided that the logical place for them was stacked one upon the other . Fine , they fit snugly . ( I have not had a problem with heat yet , and these drives have been running together for over two months . The next problem was connecting the drive . If you have a spare internal hard disk power cable as I did , then half of your troubles are over . just splice in the extra cable so that you get one square motherboard connector and two hard disk power connectors . If you do n't have a spare cable , you will have to buy the wires and connectors which can be found in any good electronics store for about $ 10 . I would suggest properly soldering/heatshrinking the connections to reduce the possibility of shorts or bad connections . Next , you need a ribbon cable connection . Again , I had a spare hard disk ribbon cable , and I wanted to be careful in case this did n't word so what I did was purchase a crimp on 50 pin cable connector that gave me another male connector in the middle of my spare cable . The part cost $ 10 again , and is easily attached with any good wood vice . The theory behind using a crimp on connector is that if this does n't work , my original cable is not damaged , and I can go back to the original setup . Having done all that , I could n't be bothered to check the dev notes for power consumption so I plugged it in and it works like a charm to this day . In a mac II , everything should work the same . Be careful with the ID 's of the drive , and ensure that the terminating resistors on both drives are intact . I did not try this without the terminating resistors but it seemed logical that if I am splitting the SCSI chain , that the signal should be terminated at all the ends . Let me know if you have any more questions . Peter Hansen Bell Northern Research pgmoffc @ BNR.ca

From : halsall @ murray.fordham.edu ( Paul Halsall ) Subject : Catholic Liturgy Reply-To : halsall @ murray.fordham.edu Organization : J . Random Misconfigured Site Lines : 60 The problems with Catholic liturgy are likely to continue for some time . The problem is , in a nutshell , this : the Liturgy is a symbolic action - in other words Catholics do [ or should ] believe that the _signs_ during the mass - Water , Blessings , Vestments , Altar , Relics , etc - are real . That is the sprinkling of water bestows real , almost tangible , holiness , the Vestments are a real indication of real sacred time . The point of a _symbol_ is that it is understood by all to be connected to an underlying REAL referent . This kind of thinking precludes analysis ; holy water is not holy because of anything , it simply IS holy . But , modern westerners find it extremely difficult , especially if well- educated , to think of the mass as a symbol . We are more likely to see it as a _sign_ , ie an action that represents grace , but which could be replaced with other signs . In concrete terms , this means the mass has become a commercial for God 's grace rather than the real thing . You can mess around with a commercial in a way you wouldn't dare with the real thing [ ask Coca-Cola Co. ! ] . These attitudes have been encouraged by Liturgy workshops , etc . which instead of focusing on _how_ to do do liturgy , have focused on how to create a meaning in liturgy . You can only create signs , symbols have to come from God [ or the heart , or somewhere deeper than analysis . The most dramatic example of this shift in understanding has been in the treatment of the sacred species [ the consecrated host and wine ] . Now , with pita bread etc , it is common to come away from the altar with hands covered in particles . If the Host is a sign of Grace , this isnt and issue ; but Catholics in the past would have been distraught at this real desacration of the real symbol of Jesus ' body . Modern Catholic liturgy is caught in this epistemological shift . We try to perfrom the old rites , but then we have some liturgomaniac priest get up and 'explain ' what we are doing - so we stop doing it and start pretending to do it . This is not a soul filling experience . It does n't help BTW that we have got stuck witha huge amount of two and three chord ersatz-folk music [ again a result of mis-analysis : complicated tunes are in fact easier to remember than simple ones - this was the genius of Wesley and the 19C Anglican hymn writers ] . Taize ' is only slightly better . What are we to do ? Well I suggest rejecting the parish system if it does n't work for you . Search out a Church where the liturgy is well prepared not well-explained . They exist in every city . This is not BTW a matter of particular style : the music might be old or new . It is the attitude of the church that counts . Also , note that a conservative liturgy - harking back to pre-Vatican II days , does not necessarily mean the Church will be socially conservative . In NYC I can recommend : Corpus Christi - W 12st St. Corpus Christi - W 12st St. - very conservative liturgy , St. Joseph 's , Greenwich Village . - Modern , `` clean '' , largely gay Oratorian Church , Brooklyn - Very beautiful Avoid , anywhere , anytime a church with electric candles .

Hamas figures significantly in the Middle East equation . In December , Israel deported more than 400 Palestinians to Lebanon in response to Hamas 's kidnapping and execution of an Israeli soldier . A longer version appears in the May issue of Harper 's Magazine , which obtained and translated the tape . ) My name is Yasir Hammad al-Hassan Ali . I live in Nuseirat [ a refugee camp in the Gaza Strip ] . I was born in 1964 . I finished high school , then attended Gaza Polytechnic . Later , I went to work for Islamic University in Gaza as a clerk . I 'm married and I have two daughters . The Qassam Battalions are the only group in Palestine explicitly dedicated to jihad [ holy war ] . Our primary concern is Palestinians who collaborate with the enemy . Many young men and women have fallen prey to the cunning traps laid by the [ Israeli ] Security Services . Since our enemies are trying to obliterate our nation , cooperation with them is clearly a terrible crime . Our most important objective must be to put an end to the plague of collaboration . To do so , we abduct collaborators , intimidate and interrogate them in order to uncover other collaborators and expose the methods that the enemy uses to lure Palestinians into collaboration in the first place . In addition to that , naturally , we confront the problem of collaborators by executing them . We do n't execute every collaborator . After all , about 70 percent of them are innocent victims , tricked or black-mailed into their misdeeds . The decision whether to execute a collaborator is based on the seriousness of his crimes . If , like many collaborators , he has been recruited as an agent of the Israeli Border Guard then it is imperative that he be executed at once . He 's as dangerous as an Israeli soldier , so we treat him like an Israeli soldier . There 's another group of collaborators who perform an even more loathsome role -- the ones who help the enemy trap young men and women in blackmail schemes that force them to become collaborators . I regard the `` isqat '' [ the process by which a Palestinians is blackmailed into collaboration ] of single person as greater crime than the killing of a demonstrator . If someone is guilty of causing repeated cases of isqat , than it is our religious duty to execute him . A third group of collaborators is responsible for the distribution of narcotics . They work on direct orders from the Security Services to distribute drugs as widely as possible . Their victims become addicted and soon find it unbearable to quit and impossible to afford more . They collaborate in order to get the drugs they crave . The dealers must also be executed . In the battalions , we have developed a very careful method of uncovering collaborators , We ca n't afford to abduct an innocent person , because once we seize a person his reputation is tarnished forever . We will abduct and interrogate a collaborator only after evidence of his guilt has been established -- never before . If after interrogation the collaborator is found guilty beyond any doubt , then he is executed . In many cases , we do n't have to make our evidence against collaborators public , because everyone knows that they 're guilty . But when the public is n't aware that a certain individual is a collaborator , and we accuse him , people are bound to ask for evidence . Many people will proclaim his innocence , so there must be irrefutable proof before he is executed . This proof is usually obtained in the form of a confession . At first , every collaborator denies his crimes . So we start off by showing the collaborator the testimony against him . We tell him that he still has a chance to serve his people , even in the last moment of his life , by confessing and giving us the information we need . We say that we know his repentance in sincere and that he has been a victim . That kind of talk is convincing . Most of them confess after that . Others hold out ; in those cases , we apply pressure , both psychological and physical . Then the holdouts confess as well . Only one collaborator has ever been executed without an interrogation . In that case , the collaborator had been seen working for the Border Guard since before the intifada , and he himself confessed his involvement to a friend , who disclosed the information to us . In addition , three members of his network of collaborators told us that he had caused their isqat . With this much evidence , there was no need to interrogate him . But we are very careful to avoid wrongful executions . In every case , our principal is the same : the accused should be interrogated until he himself confesses his crimes . A few weeks ago , we sat down and complied a list of collaborators to decide whether there were any who could be executed without interrogation . An although we had hundreds of names , still , because of our fear of God and of hell , we could not mark any of these men , except for the one I just mentioned , for execution . When we execute a collaborator in public , we use a gun . But after we abduct and interrogate a collaborator , we ca n't shoot him -- to do so might give away our locations . That 's why collaborators are strangled . Sometimes we ask the collaborator , `` What do you think ? How should we execute you ? '' One collaborator told us , '' Strangle me . '' He hated the sight of blood . -- -- - Naftaly Stramer | Intergraph Electronics Internet : nstramer @ dazixco.ingr.com | 6101 Lookout Road , Suite A Voice : ( 303 ) 581-2370 FAX : ( 303 ) 581-9972 | Boulder , CO 80301 '' Quality is everybody 's job , and it 's everybody 's job to watch all that they can .

My argument is mainly a proposal of what I think is a plausible argument against extra-marital sex -- one which I personally believe has some truth . My main purpose for posting it here is to show that a _plausible_ argument can be made against extra-marital sex . At this stage I am not saying that this particular viewpoint is proven or anything like that , just that it is plausible . To try to convince you all of this particular point of view , I would probably have to do a lot of work researching what has been done in this field , etc. , in order to gather further evidence , which I simply do not have time to do now . Also note that I said that I think extra-marital sex is `` a prime cause '' ( in my opinion ) of the generally greater levels of psychological problems , especially depression , in Western societies . I am not saying it is `` the prime cause '' or `` the only cause '' , just `` a prime cause '' -- i.e . one of the significant contributions to this trend . I think when you say you think my view is simplistic , you have forgotten this -- I admit that there are probably other factors , but I do think that extra-marital sex ( and , IMO , subsequent destabilization of the family ) is a significant factor in the rise in psychological problems like depression in Western society this century .

Pardon me Tim , but I do not see how it can be possible for the IDF to fail to detect the presence of those responsible for planting the bomb which killed the three IDF troops and then later know the exact number and whereabouts of all of them .

First , I believe that my statement applies to both sides . Having said that , I think it is neccessary to separate what is legitimately negotiable and what is not . For example , no country has the right to abuse one 's human rights . Deciding whether there will be one or two states in Palestine is a legitimate question .

With a strong Lebanese government ( free from Syrian and Israeli interference ) I believe that the border could be adequately patrolled . The Palestinian heavy weapons have been siezed in past years and I do not see as significant a threat as once existed . Please , Tim , do n't fall into the trap of treating Lebanese and Palestinians as all part of the same group . There are too many who think all Arabs or all Muslims are the same . Too many times I have seen people support the bombing of Palestinian camps in `` retaliation '' for an IDF death at the hands of the Lebanese Resistance or the shelling of Lebanese villages in `` retaliation '' for a Palestinian attack . | > Tim

Not necessarily . I 've been thinking about this , and if this chip/scheme is to provide any real security , there must be some sort of key exchange , either using a public-key encryption scheme , or using a key exchange scheme like Diffie-Hellman . If there 's an out-of-band transmission of a shared session key , then what protects that band from eavesdropping ? If the phone company or some other online central authority generates a session key and sends it to both users , then what 's the point of going to the trouble of having some complicated key-depositories ? Just ask the phone company for a copy of the session key for each call . Now , it 's probably not practical for each user to keep an online copy of every public key used by anyone anywhere , right ? So , probably , there will be some way of getting these keys verified . This might be a digitally- signed ( by the chip manufacturer ) copy of the public key in this unit , stored by this unit . It might also be an online directory with access to everyone 's public keys . ( This would introduce another weakness to the security of the scheme , of course . ) Presumably , if you do n't use your designated key , you ca n't get a verified connection to other standard chips . It might be useful to have a modified chip , which would allow you to use either the original public/private key pair , or some other key pair and verification scheme . Unfortunately , this would not allow you to call most people and establish secure communications ... . -- John Kelsey > I hope somebody starts doing this soon after the first > ones are released ...

We have no way of knowing because we can not separate Morris ' contribu- tion from the rest of the team 's . There is only one way of determin- ing `` best '' in baseball . And that is by looking at the scoreboard at the end of the game . Each game determines which *team* is the best that day . At the end of the season , the team that was the best the most often is the best in the division . The playoffs determine the best of the best . But the point is that the only decision making pro- cess used to determine the `` best '' is the score of the game and it re- lates to the *teams* . Not the individual players . There is no method inherent in baseball of comparing individual performances . And that is how it should be , because , after all , baseball is a team game . To say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab- solutely that player A 's team would have played better with player B in their lineup . Sheer speculation . Impossible to ascertain . If you want to select a group of statistics and claim that Clemens has done better with those statistics as a criteria , then fine . But you have to be able to prove that those statistics measure the individual 's contribution to winning the WS - because that is the only measure of `` best '' that has any meaning in the context of base- ball . So until you can prove that Clemens contributes to a WS cham- pionship more than Morris your evaluation of Clemens is totally sub- jective and is mere opinion . I have yet to see that any of you can predict a WS winner with any greater accuracy than Jeanne Dixon . > The fact is that Morris did n't `` win '' any ballgames , Toronto did , in > spite of Morris ' `` contribution '' . This has been explained to you Exactly . The Jays won with Morris pitching . And Boston wins with Clemens pitching . I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens . I am saying that individual comparisons between players are totally meaningless and that anyone claiming that Clemens is better based on his ERA has missed the point of what baseball is all about . > many , many times and you are either too stupid or too stubborn to grasp it . You do n't have to be rude . > You are completely consumed by the post hoc , ergo propter hoc fallacy . For you to say that means that you have either missed the entire point of my argument , or you yourself have committed a fallacy - Ignoratio Elenchi . I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens because he has more rings ( although I have , tongue in cheek , claimed that in the past ) . I am saying that it is impossible to isolate an individual 's performance from that of his team 's for the purpose of comparing that individual 's performance with another individual 's per- formance . The stats are a nice hobby and that 's about it . There is no new knowledge being produced . So when a poster claims that Morris is better than Clemens because he has more rings , the poster is no more nor less incorrect than the rest of you baying hounds . -- cordially , as always , maynard @ ramsey.cs.laurentian.ca `` So many morons ... rm ... and so little time .

From : oecjtb @ oec4.orbital.dialix.oz.au ( John Bongiovanni ) Subject : SUMMARY : Borland/Microsoft Database C Libraries Organization : Orbital Engine Company Lines : 384 Well , I 'm amazed at how successful this exercise was . I received 20 responses and 4 requests for summary . Thanks to everyone who made it possible . On my own I was able to find out about Codebase , Accsys , and Q+E . Codebase and Accsys are C libraries without SQL . Q+E is a Windows application that can be communicated through Windows DDE calls , where you send a SQL string and receive the results . Most people wrote to tell me about the Paradox Engine from Borland . Other products mentioned were : Microsoft 's ODBC , Accsys , Quadbase , Codebase , RBASE , and Q+E . Only ODBC , Quadbase , RBASE , and Q+E have SQL . For myself , I decided on Codebase , mostly because it has an ANSI C portability version that runs under DOS , UNIX , etc , and includes the source code , and portability is important in my application . It works with DBASE , FoxPro , or Clipper files . However , I feel that Microsoft 's ODBC looks very promising . It 's mostly a formalisation of building and submitting SQL queries , and formatting query results . As the responses say , it 's available via ftp , except it 's effectively unusuable without two manuals : the `` ODBC Programmer 's Reference '' and the `` ODBC SDK Guide '' . Moreover , ODBC does n't actually interpret SQL and liase with databases , that 's up to drivers that should be provided by database manufacturers . Also , it 's Windows only ( it 's actually an extension to the Windows SDK ) . Nevertheless , it 's a start at a SQL interface standard , and should make life interesting in the future . Here 's my original post , followed by the responses , separated by a line of asterisks ( * ) . > Does anyone know if Borland or Microsoft have libraries for accessing > their respective databases ( Paradox , FoxPro ) from within C programs ? > I 'd really like to be able to build a SQL query string and pass it > to a function which returns the query results in some format .

From : sommerfeld @ apollo.hp.com ( Bill Sommerfeld ) Subject : A little political philosophy worth reading . Lines : 66 Nntp-Posting-Host : snarfblatt.ch.apollo.hp.com Organization : Hewlett Packard Read this through once or twice . Then replace `` prince '' with '' government '' or `` president '' , as appropriate , and read it again . [ From Chapter XX of _The Prince_ , by N. Macchiavelli , as translated by Daniel Donno . ] In order to keep their lands secure , some princes have disarmed their subjects ; others have prompted division within the cities they have subjugated . Some have nurtured animosities against themselves ; others have sought to win the approval of those they initially distrusted . Some have erected fortresses ; others have destroyed them . Now , although it is impossible to set down definite judgements on all of these measures without considering the particular circumstances of the states where they may be employed , I shall nevertheless discuss them in such broad terms as the subject itself will allow . To begin with , there has never been a case of a new prince disarming his subjects . Indeed , whenever he found them disarmed , he proceeded to arm them . For by arming your subjects , you make their arms your own . Those among them who are suspicious become loyal , while those who are already loyal remain so , and from subjects they are transformed into partisans . Though you can not arm them all , nonetheless you increase your safety among those you leave unarmed by extending privileges to those you arm . Your different treatment of the two categories will make the latter feel obligated to you , while the former will consider it proper thoat those who assume added duties and dangers should receive advantages . When you disarm your subjects , however , you offend them , by showing that , either from cowardliness or from lack of faith , you distrust them ; and either conclusion will induce them to hate you . Moreover , since it is impossible for you to remain unarmed , you would have to resort to mercenaries , whose limitations have already been discussed . Even if such troops were good , however , they could never be good enough to defend you from powerful enemies , and doubtful subjects . Therefore , as I have said , a new prince in a newly acquired state has always taken measures to arm his subjects , and history is full of examples proving that this is so . But when a prince takes posession of a new state which he annexes as an addition to his original domain , then he must disarm all the subjects of the new state except those who helped him to acquire it ; and these , as time and occasion permit , he must seek to render soft and weak . He must arrange matters in such a way that the arms of the entire state will be in the hands of soldiers who are native to his original domain . ... And since the subject demands it , I will not fail to remind any prince who has acquired a new state by the aid of its inhabitants that he soundly consider what induced them to assist him ; if the reason is not natural affection for him , but rather dissatisfaction with the former government , he will find it extremely difficult to keep them friendly , for it will be impossible to please them . If he will carefully think the matter through in the light of examples drawn from ancient and modern affairs , he will understand why it is much easier to win the favor of those who were happy with their former government , and hence were his enemies , than to keep the favor of those who , out of dissatisfaction with the former rule , helped him to replace it .

Subject : After-Market Cruise Controls : Specific Questions From : MikeW @ Canc.byu.edu ( M.D . ( Mike ) Wieda ) Organization : BYU Nntp-Posting-Host : 128.187.203.40 Lines : 82 Howdy , I 'm a little new to this newsgroup , but I would like to tap some of the knowledge and expertise available here . The Subject : After-market cruise controls The Background : I recently broke my ankle in a road-bicycling accident ( 4 places , five screws , yuk ! : - ( ) . In two weeks I will be returning to Texas ( my home ) from my school ( BYU ) in Provo , Utah . As you can imagine , trying to drive nearly 1300 miles with a broken right ankle is n't just the epitome of a good time . My car does not have a cruise control , so I would have to do all the pedalling ( ha ha ) with my messed-up ankle . My question : What is the general opinion of after-market cruise control units ? I realize that a cheap CC ( cruise control ) from , say , Pep Boys , is n't going to be as good as a factory or professionally installed unit ( if there is such a thing ) . And I uderstand that I probably ca n't expect much in the way of accuracy , looks and that sort of thing ; But anything 's got ta be better than trying to drive with a hosed ankle . I have a 1984 Jeep Cherokee , 4 speed , standard , 4*4 , 2.5L engine with kettering ( sp ? ) ignition ( y'know , distributor cap , rotor , that set-up -- not electronic . Maybe you could 've guessed it being an '84 , but I 'm just trying to give information as completly as I can ) . I found a CC unit for 80 bucks . It seems to use the vehicles vacuum system instead of an electric servor/motor . Is this good or bad ? If I did buy this CC , which vacuum hose should I tap ? It has two speed sensors : One magnetic , and one that gets a signal from the negative side of the distributor , kinda like a tach pick-up , or so I understand . I can use either one . Which is best ? The manual says ( I read it in the store today ) that the magnetic/axle set-up is more accurate , but harder to install . Is there really a big difference ? It has a sensor for the brake pedal , just like other CCs , but does NOT have a sensor for the clutch pedal . So if I was n't paying real close attention I might push the clutch in while the cruise is trying to get the speed up . Which would wind the engine up kinda high until I got my wits about me and turned the thing off . I 'm pretty coordinated , so this does n't bother me , if it were for my girlfriends car , *then* it would bother me , but I 'm ok with it . The installation also calls for an attachment to a steady-on brake signal and a switched-on brake signal . I think I can get a switched brake signal from the correct side of the brake light blade fuse . Am I right ? But I'm not sure where to get the steady-on brake signal , or , for that matter , what exactly it is ? Any ideas as to what the manufaturer wants and where to get it ? I think I can figure the other things out . Like how to hook-up the negative side tach-type sensing gizmo and the cabin control unit , and the ground and all that miscellaneous business . But I need a little help with : 1 . Is it worth the money and safety risk ( if any ) for such a device ? 2 . Is there any particularly good after-market CC ? 3 . Are `` professionally '' installed CCs signifacantly better and worth the cabbage ? 4 . If the unit I saw ( sorry , no manufacturer or model number , just that it is at Pep Boy and its $ 80 ) is sufficient for my simple needs , how do I get the thing installed properly ( specifically , the questions above ) ? My father and I built a `` Veep '' ( Volkswagen powered Jeep CJ-2A ) when I was in high school , so I consider myself fairly good with tools , electronics , and cars . So the installation does n't scare me . I just want to be certain that I get the thing installed correctly as my Cherokee is just a wee bit more complicated than my Veep . : - ) I appreciate your time in reading my post , and I would appreciate any expertise or opinion anybody has on the subject . If you would like to share some of your wisdom , please email as I do n't get over this group very often ( but I check my mail all the time ) . Again , thanks for any help anyone may have .

What I have seen from the March Beta is that it does n't yet come with the stuff which exploits multi-user features . I remember somebody from MS stating that it does n't allow two users share one GUI . My interpretation of this was that one user per console but all the networking and RPC based stuff you want . I believe ftp and rlogin deamons for NT systems will come from third party . Somebody already has a Beta version of an unsecure ftpd on the net . There is no reason why one can not write a posix based shell like csh on Unix for remote logins . In general I liked NT when I checked it out . It slow compared to Win3.1 ( just like any other real OS ) . The beta version , although being slow , botts up much faster than my SUN workstation . Windows subsystems also start up a lot faster than X windows . I believe Bill Gates was right when he stated that NT was not for everybody . After playing around with it for a while I was convinced . If I owned a busines using a `` business computer '' from IBM or some other established vendor , I would consider moving to NT platform because it would provide a much cheaper solution ( If you are running SQL servers etc. ) . It provides the robustness such an application requires . On the other hand if you like your DOS games , more or less forget about NT . You can always boot to DOS but in general that defeats the purpose of using NT . Most of NT 's features are visible in a networked environment and in such an environment you ca n't reboot your machine at will . For personal use , I would rather wait for the Win32 based Windows release ( whatever you name it ) than jump to NT bandwagon . I expect most applications will keep on using Win16 until Win32 becomes widely available . -- Sadun Anik , U of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Center for Reliable and High-performance Computing e-mail : anik @ crhc.uiuc.edu

An option in the menu contained in the Xterm runs a Fortran subroutine that creats a Tektronics-mode Xterm for displaying some graphics . Typing a < RET > while the Tektronics-mode Xterm ( future reference to this will be `` Tek-term '' ) is active makes the Xterm read future keystrokes but does not shift input focus to the Xterm ( I 'm basing that statement on the fact that the border of the Tek-term stays the highlighted color and that the Tek-term stays on top of Xterm . If what I 'm describing is n't input focus , let me know . ) The xterm can be brought to the top by clicking the mouse button on it . Subsequent selections from the Xterm of the menu item that displays graphics highlihts the border and displays the updated graphics , but does not move the Tek-term to the top . If the Tek-term has been iconized to conserve screen space , it stays an icon . The desired behavior : one of two options - 1 . Whichever of the windows that is active is always on top of the inactive one . 2 . Whenever the Tek-term is inactivated , it should revert to a icon but when it is activated it should become a window on a higher level than the Xterm . What I think I need : a means of specifying that a Xterm or Tek-term will be at the highest level and a way to iconify/expand a Xterm and Tek-term . These commands , would , I 'd guess , need to be in the Fortran or in the command that starts up the Xterm and Tek-term . Other information : All this is taking place on a VT-1300 ( a DEC dumb X-windows terminal ) connected to a VAX running VMS and Motif . Thanks for your time .

The total team salary is $ 7,781,500 , averaging slightly over $ 300K a player .

Theory of one-way hash functions , distinctions of terms . MD4 and MD5 . Snefru . X-Last-Updated : 1993/04/16 Archive-name : cryptography-faq/part07 Last-modified : 1993/4/15 FAQ for sci.crypt , part 7 : Digital Signatures and Hash Functions This is the seventh of ten parts of the sci.crypt FAQ . The parts are mostly independent , but you should read the first part before the rest . We do n't have the time to send out missing parts by mail , so do n't ask . Notes such as `` [ KAH67 ] '' refer to the reference list in the last part . The sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu as /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part [ xx ] . The Cryptography FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt , sci.answers , and news.answers every 21 days . Contents : * What is a one-way hash function ? * What is the difference between public , private , secret , shared , etc. ? * What are MD4 and MD5 ? * What is Snefru ? * What is a one-way hash function ? A typical one-way hash function takes a variable-length message and produces a fixed-length hash . Given the hash it is computationally impossible to find a message with that hash ; in fact one can't determine any usable information about a message with that hash , not even a single bit . For some one-way hash functions it 's also computationally impossible to determine two messages which produce the same hash . A one-way hash function can be private or public , just like an encryption function . Here 's one application of a public one-way hash function , like MD5 or Snefru . Most public-key signature systems are relatively slow . To sign a long message may take longer than the user is willing to wait . Solution : Compute the one-way hash of the message , and sign the hash , which is short . Now anyone who wants to verify the signature can do the same thing . Another name for one-way hash function is message digest function . * What is the difference between public , private , secret , shared , etc. ? There is a horrendous mishmash of terminology in the literature for a very small set of concepts . When an algorithm depends on a key which is n't published , we call it a private algorithm ; otherwise we call it a public algorithm . We have encryption functions E and decryption functions D , so that D ( E ( M ) ) = M for any message M. We also have hashing functions H and verification functions V , such that V ( M , X ) = 1 if and only if X = H ( M ) . A public-key cryptosystem has public encryption and private decryption . Checksums , such as the application mentioned in the previous question , have public hashing and public verification . Digital signature functions have private hashing and public verification : only one person can produce the hash for a message , but everyone can verify that the hash is correct . Obviously , when an algorithm depends on a private key , it 's meant to be unusable by anyone who does n't have the key . There 's no real difference between a `` shared '' key and a private key : a shared key is n't published , so it 's private . If you encrypt data for a friend rather than `` for your eyes only '' , are you suddenly doing `` shared-key encryption '' rather than private-key encryption ? No . * What are MD4 and MD5 ? MD4 and MD5 are message digest functions developed by Ron Rivest . Definitions appear in RFC 1320 and RFC 1321 ( see part 10 ) . Code is available from [ FTPMD ] . Note that a transcription error was found in the original MD5 draft RFC . The corrected algorithm should be called MD5a , though some people refer to it as MD5 . * What is Snefru ? Snefru is a family of message digest functions developed by Ralph Merkle . Snefru-8 is an 8-round function , the newest in the family . Definitions appear in Merkle 's paper [ ME91a ] . Code is available from [ FTPSF ] .

Ok , so your a HAM . Well , tune in 10.7Mhz or 455Khz . These numbers sound like some you have herd before ? Thats right , you guessed it , they are common IF numbers . Every Super-Het receiver has a local oscillator ( s ) which generates an IF . This is what your detector detector is detecting ( the local oscillator ) . Some of these have two or more local oscillator which generate more ways to receiver you . If you want to receiver something at say 10.525Ghz you must generate a local oscillator signal of 10.525Ghz - 10.7Mhz = your local osc frequency . This 10.7Mhz IF is then fed into a normal AGC ckt . The detector is keyed uppon the AGC voltage ( your mileage may vary ) . Since the AGC is a negative feed back device , a positive voltage sets off a ... I think you get the picture .

I also reviewed a new Nanao , the F550iW , which has just been released . Last year for the May '92 issue of Windows , I reviewed several monitors , including the Nanao T560i . There 's no question that the Nanao monitors are the best available this year , just as they were last year . The difference between my ranking of the best in Windows and the ranking in Windows Sources is due mainly to a difference in the testing criteria and the scoring . I used different tests than they did , and I scored differently . There 's nothing wrong with the Mitsubishi , and it scored very highly in my tests , but it was a few points shy of perfect . Incidentally , one of the things everyone should do when they 're reading reviews of any product , whether it 's monitors or mice , is to read the criteria and methodology carefully . Unless you know how the product testing was done , and on what the scores are based , you ca n't possibly know what they really mean . Just seeing that I rank a monitor differently from Windows Sources is meaningless without knowing how we did the ranking . Likewise , it 's impossible to tell whether a monitor will meet your needs unless you know how we did the testing . After all , some of what we do may not apply to you . Likewise , some of what we do may apply more closely in one review than in another . You ca n't always tell anything from reading the 300 or so words of commentary we write if you do n't also understand the scoring . Wayne Rash

Basically the Glock is great but I have heard/read that it is a lot harder to learn proper handling because of the type of safety that it has . I was looking at a Glock .40S & W and the S & W 4006 a couple of weeks ago and the safties on the guns were very different . The saftey on the 4006 seemed a lot more `` safe '' ( for lack of a better word ) than the one on the Glock . Of course this could also be a bad thing if you were to pull the gun on somebody . You would spend more time fiddling around turning the safety off . Personally I like the Glocks because they are very light and I think they look really cool ( guess that 's why they use them in so many movies ) but I would n't get one as my first semi-auto because of the safety . I would prefer more training with a `` traditional '' semi-auto ( ala Colt .45 ) but of course that 's just my opinion . Jason

Source : 'The Times , ' 3 March 1992 MASSACRE UNCOVERED ... . By ANATOL LIEVEN , More than sixty bodies , including those of women and children , have been spotted on hillsides in Nagorno-Karabakh , confirming claims that Armenian troops massacred Azeri refugees . Hundreds are missing . Scattered amid the withered grass and bushes along a small valley and across the hillside beyond are the bodies of last Wednesday 's massacre by Armenian forces of Azerbaijani refugees . From that hill can be seen both the Armenian-controlled town of Askeran and the outskirts of the Azerbaijani military headquarters of Agdam . Those who died very nearly made it to the safety of their own lines . We landed at this spot by helicopter yesterday afternoon as the last troops of the Commonwealth of Independent states began pulling out . They left unhindered by the warring factions as General Boris Gromov , who oversaw the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan , flew to Stepanakert to ease their departure . A local truce was enforced to allow the Azerbaijaines to collect their dead and any refugees still hiding in the hills and forest . All the same , two attack helicopters circled continuously the nearby Armenian positions . In all , 31 bodies could be counted at the scene . At least another 31 have been taken into Agdam over the past five days . These figures do not include civilians reported killed when the Armenians stormed the Azerbaijani town of Khodjaly on Tuesday night . The figures also do not include other as yet undiscovered bodies Zahid Jabarov , a survivor of the massacre , said he saw up to 200 people shot down at the point we visited , and refugees who came by different routes have also told of being shot at repeatedly and of leaving a trail of bodies along their path . Around the bodies we saw were scattered possessions , clothing and personnel documents . The bodies themselves have been preserved by the bitter cold which killed others as they hid in the hills and forest after the massacre . All are the bodies of ordinary people , dressed in the poor , ugly clothing of workers . Of the 31 we saw , only one policeman and two apparent national volunteers were wearing uniform . All the rest were civilians , including eight women and three small children . TWO GROUPS , APPARENTLY FAMILIES , HAD FALLEN TOGETHER , THE CHILDREN CRADLED IN THE WOMEN 'S ARMS . SEVERAL OF THEM , INCLUDING ONE SMALL GIRL , HAD TERRIBLE HEAD INJURIES : ONLY HER FACE WAS LEFT . SURVIVORS HAVE TOLD HOW THEY SAW ARMENIANS SHOOTING THEM POINT BLANK AS THEY LAY ON THE GROUND .

From : hall @ vice.ico.tek.com ( Hal F Lillywhite ) Subject : Re : Ancient Books Organization : Tektronix Inc. , Beaverton , Or . Lines : 106 { I sent in something on this before but I believe it got lost in the weekend accident the moderator described . This is an improved version anyway so no loss the first time . HL } The standard work on detecting forgeries of ancient documents is probably the writing of Friedrich Blass , `` Hermeneutrik und Kritik , '' _Einleitende und Hilfsdisziplinen_ , vol 1 of _Handbuch der Klassischen Altertums- wissenshaft_ ( Noerdlingen : Beck , 1886 ) . Portions of this are described in Nibley , _The Prophetic Book op Mormon_ , pp 219-242 ( SLC : Deseret Book , 1989 ) . ( If you want to attempt reading this be forewarned . Nibley describes Blass as a typical German scholar who claims little knowledge of his subject , then proceeds to exhaust both the subject and the reader . ) Nibley 's extract from Blass 's work is in the form of `` rules for forgers . '' It makes interesting reading . I confess that I have not read Blass 's work , only Nibley 's extract thereof . My German falls far short of what would be required and as far as I know there is no English translation available . However , I believe the techniques he describes are known widely enough that any competent classical scholar could examine a purportedly ancient document and at least determine if it is consistent with what one would expect of a genuine document of that time frame . We will not be able to prove who wrote it but at least we should be able to determine with reasonable confidence if it is from that time and culture or is a later forgery . Actually there are 2 types of purportedly ancient documents : 1 . Alleged actual holographs or early copies thereof . For example the Dead Sea Scrolls . These can be tested by various scientific means to determine the age of the paper , inks , and objects found with them . This can provide a pretty clear dating of the actual physical objects . 2 . Documents claiming to be copies of ancient works although the copy itself may be much more recent . For example we might find a document which monks in a monastary claim is a copy of something from centuries ago ( perhaps even having been through several generations of copists ) . This is more of a problem but can still be tested ( although the test is not likely to be simple ) . We can not expect a test of the age of the physical objects to tell us much so we must confine our testing to the text itself . It is important to remember that none of these tests can tell us if the document is really what it claims to be . They can only date the document and identify its culture of origin . For example I 've heard of a letter supposed to have been written by Jesus himself to a king in what is now Iraq . If this document were to actually turn up scholars could date the paper and ink ( assuming they have the holograph ) . They could check the language , content and writing style to see if they are consistent with what would be expected of a Palestinian Jew of that time . However even if all test results were positive there is no way to determine if Jesus himself actually wrote it . We would know what time and culture it came from but ( barring a known sample of Jesus handwriting or other clues for comparison ) scholarship must stop there . There is seldom any way to determine who the actual author was . As I say , I 'm no expert on Blas 's work . I do remember some of the tests which can be applied to alleged copies of ancient works . Specifically we might ask : 1 . Is the document internally consistent ? Does it contradict itself ? If the work it is short it would be relatively easy to maintain internal consistency , even if it is a forgery . The longer the forgery the more difficult it is to maintain consistency . For this reason most successful forgers stick to short documents . 2 . Is it consistent with the history and geography of the time ? Again a short , non-specific work might not be testable but if the writing is of any significant length no latter-day forger would be able to escape detection . Here we look for the minor , inconspicuous things which someone from that culture would get right without even thinking about it but which a later forger would find too numerous and trivial to check . The devil is in the details . 3 . What about the literary style of the work , figures of speech etc . Any ancient writer would almost certainly speak in ways that seem strange to us . Are there any such odd phrases in this book ? If so do they fit in with the culture ? Of course there are complications if the document has been translated , or possibly even if somebody just updated language when he copied it . A few cases of language not from the culture claimed may be allowed in recent copies . They cause problems and reduce certainty to be sure but do n't necessarily prove forgery . These tests can be quite effective ( given enough material to work with ) but they are not easy . They require the skills of the historian , the linguist , the anthropologist etc . The questions to ask are , `` Is every aspect of this document consistent with what we know about the culture of claimed origin ? '' If there are things which do n't fit how significant are they ? Are problem areas due to our lack of knowledge , later changes by copists or are they really significant ? There will often be some ambiguity since we never know everything about the culture . The end result of any such testing is occasionally certain ( particularly in the case of holographs or other ancient copies ) . However often it may just be a probability or an indication that the document ( or maybe parts of it ) is probably authentic ( or sometimes maybe other parts are later additions ) . This is often unsettling to a generation raised on TV where all problems are solved in 30 to 60 minutes with time out for commercials . It is , however , the real world and what scholarship has to offer .

There are several different speeds of SMD , and I think that the Fuji drive you have is rated at about 24 Mb/sec ( thats megabits ) . There used to be several companies that made couplers for the PC ( Interphase in Texas being one ) , but I think that the market pretty much has dried up .

From : schmidt @ auvax1.adelphi.edu Subject : Grounding power wiring , was Re : a question about 120VAC outlet wiring Lines : 163 Nntp-Posting-Host : auvax1 Organization : Adelphi University , Garden City NY There has been quite a bit of discussion about house wiring and grounding practices here . A few points need to be clarified : The Equipment GROUNDING conductor , Green , green with a yellow stripe , bare , or the metal sheath or pipe of SOME wiring methods , is used as a safety ground , to carry fault currents back to the circuit breaker panel , and to limit the voltage on the metal case of utilization equipment or other metal objects . It should never ( except for a few exceptions to be discussed later ) carry the normal operating current of a connected load . Some equipment has filters in the power supply which may cause some slight current flow through the grounding conductor . Much communications or audio equipment is sensitive to noise or slight voltages on the grounding conductor , and may require special wiring of the grounding conductors to provide reliable operation ( `` orange '' outlets are often used for this , with insulated grounding conductors wired back to the panel box , and in many cases back to the service . Anyone installing such a system should read both the section on grounding in the National Electric Code and publications on installing quiet isolated ground systems . The code requires the insulated grounding conductors ( green wires ) to run with the current carrying conductors back to the panel box , and , if required , back all the way to the service entrance , where it is bonded to the service ground ( water pipe or rod ) Many of these systems are installed illegally or unsafely , where they do not provide a safe ground or a quiet ground or either . The GROUNDED conductor of a circuit , often called the NEUTRAL , which is referred to in the code as the `` identified '' conductor and is supposed to be white or natural grey . This conductor is supposed to be connected to ground in most electrical systems at a single point , generally at the service entrance panel . This connection is through the Main Bonding Jumper . ( In many household service panels , the main bonding jumper is actually a bonding screw which attaches the neutral busbar to the case of the panel ) The Grounded conductor ( neutral ) is generally a current carrying conductor . In the case of a 120 volt circuit it is one of the two conductors completing the circuit from the panel to the load device . Since the grounded conductor ( neutral ) is only connected to the grounding conductor ( bare or green ) at the service entrance , if the load is any distance from the service and draws any significant current , there will be a small but measurable voltage between the grounded and grounding conductors at the load , under normal operating conditions . If you should ( incorrectly ) connect the grounded ( neutral ) conductor to the grounding conductor at the load , some of the neutral current will flow instead through the grounding conductor . Since there will now be current flowing through the grounding conductor , it will also no longer be quite at ground potential at the load end . If the load equipment has a metal case , which is connected to the grounding conductor through the `` U '' ground plug , the metal case is now also no longer quite at ground potential . The difference ( under normal , non short-circuit conditions ) may be only a few tenths of a volt , but it could also be a volt or two . This normally does not present a shock hazard . HOWEVER , if you let the metal case of the grounded equipment come into contact with an independently grounded object such as a water or gas pipe , a radiator , a metal air conditioning duct or such , part of the neutral current will try to flow through this aalternate ground path . If the contact is not solid , you will get a significant arc ( a low voltage , but possibly moderate current arc ) Under the wrong conditions , this arcing could start a fire . It is possible in some cases that the sneak ground current could also flow through a wire of inadequate size , causing it to overheat . With the incorrect non single-point grounding of the neutral , if there is a short circuit from hot to neutral , the high short circuit current which may flow will cause a much higher voltage on the grounding conductor , which increases the possibility for shock or fire . Also if you incorrectly multiply connect the neutral and ground , the voltage on the ground system is seen as noise bu computer or audio equipment , often causing malfunction . I have spent some hours tracking down such shorts in technical facilities where they were inducing severe hum into equipment . The Neutral is usually bonded to the ground at the distribution transformer as well as at the service entrance of each dwelling . This is done primarily for lightning protection , so that induced lightning currents have a short path back to ground , and also to assure that the currents drawn by shorts to grounded objects like pipes draw enough current to trip circuit breakers or blow fuses quickly . The bad side of this is that not all the neutral current from the dwelling goes through the neutral wire back to the transformer . Some of it flows through the grounding electrode ( water pipe , etc . ) this may cause corrosion in the pipes and possibly in things like underground fuel oil tanks , and it may also cause measurable AC magnetic fields due to the large loop between the `` hot '' conductors in the service and the neutral current in the water pipe and ground . There are those who feel these fields may be unhealthy . ( do n't flame ME on this , I 'm just telling you where the field comes from , not it 's health effect , as far as I 'm concerned , the jury is still out on this . ) Note that the bonding jumper is only installed at the main panel , NOT at any sub distribution panels . This is one reason why it is illegal to run service entrance cable with the sheath used as a neutral to a sub panel , you must have a seperate insulated conductor for the neutral . The sheath can be used in this application only as the groundING conductor . If the neutral is bonded to the grounding conductor in the sub panel , say by forgetting to remove the bonding screw , all the grounding conductors of the loads on that panel will be above ground , with the possible problems listed above . The code makes exceptions for ranges and dryers , as well as feeds from one building to another . In the cases of the range and dryer , the neutral may be used as the equipment ground under certain conditions , instead of a seperate wire . Every time the code is revised , these exceptions come up for review . These exceptions were , in fact the first required safety grounds , in the days before U ground outlets and such . The appliance manufacturers do n't want to have to redesign their ranges and driers , and the contractors do n't want to have to run four wire cable ( with four fairly heavy , expensive wires ) in place of three wire to the appliances . No question it would be safer with seperate neutrals to the stove , but the neutral current is low for most burner settings ( since most current is in the 220 volt `` hots '' except at some low settings , the wires are large gauge , and there are few reported cases of injury or damage . So far , the exceptions have survived . In the case of feeds between buildings , it 's primarily for lightning protection . People doing wiring should be aware what is and what is n't a legal grounding conductor . Obviously , the bare wire in `` romex '' 'with ground ' is . Anywhere there is a green wire installed , such as in a portable cord , that is a good grounding conductor . The sheath of BX clamped in BX connectors in metal boxes is a legal grounding conductor ( in the US ) . ( BX has an aluminum band run under the steel sheath to lower the resistance of the sheath . You can just cut this aluminum band off at the ends , you do n't have to bond it to anything , it does its job by touching every turn of the BX sheath . ) Conduit or EMT ( thinwall tubing ) is generally a legal grounding conductor , but may require a bonding locknut where it enters a box or panel , particularly for larger pipes . `` Greenfield '' ( looks like big BX , but you pull your own wires in the empty sheath after you run it ) is NOT a legal grounding conductor , as it does n't have the aluminum band to bond it , and the spiral steel has too much resistance and inductance . You have to run a seperate green grounding conductor inside the greenfield . `` Wiremold '' is also not a legal grounding conductor , as the paint on the boxes often prevents good contact , and the `` feed '' to the wiremold extension is often from a box in the wall that may not be well connected to the first wiremold box . I have personally discovered cases where the entire run of wiremold and the cases of everything plugged into all the outlets on the run were `` hot '' with 120 volts ( Why do I get a shock every time I touch my computer and the radiator here in the office ? ) because there was no ground wire in the wiremold and one of the outlets had shorted to the edge of the wiremold box . You must run a ground wire back in the wiremold from the outlets at least to the first box in the original wiring ( conduit , BX , etc . ) where you can `` bond '' the wire to the box with a screw , bnding clip , or whatever . On another issue , while you should ground the green wire/lug on GCFI outlets when ever there is a place to ground them , it is legal in the NEC to use them without a ground if no ground is available . It is better to have the protection of the Ground fault interrupter than no protection if you don't install it . The interrupter does n't depend on the ground to trip . It is desirable to connect the ground if available , because if the ground is connected , the interrupter will trip as soon as a faulty device is plugged in , whereas without the ground , it will not trip until someone or something provides a ground path . For those questioning the legal use of ungrounded GCFI 's , read in the NEC , 210-7 ( d ) exception . ( This is the 1990 code , my '93 code is in the city , but I know the rule has n't changed . It might be renumbered though . ) We have only touched the surface concerning grounding ; - } , there is much more to this subject , but most of you have fallen asleep by now .

The secondary current will be .6 A ( 600 mA ) . What kind of transformer should I use ( ferrite ? ) Can I buy one ? If so , I need a partnumber and supplier If I can not buy one , how do I go about winding one myself ? What core do I use , how big must it be in order not to saturate , what thickness copper wire , how many turns , etc. ? I know little about analog electronics , so I hope some kind soul here will help me out . Pointers to relevant databooks will also be highly appreciated . Thanks , Mark de Rooi rooi @ tpd.tno.nl

From : nextug @ ac.dal.ca Subject : Powerbook 140-180 Batteries Organization : Dalhousie University , Halifax , Nova Scotia , Canada Lines : 15 A quick query for Powerbook gurus : Tom Spearman , in a post on alternative Powerbook battery options mentioned that there exist 3 versions of their Powerbook 140-180 batteries : a 2.5 amp hour one ( M5545/A ) , a 2.8 amp hour one , ( M5545/B ) and a 2.9 amp hour one ( M5545/C ) . Anyone out there know how to determine which of these a battery is ? I looked at my battery and there is no obvious exterior indication . I contacted Tom Spearman who had gleaned the information from MacUser and he did n't know either . Anyone out there know the answer ? Thanks ! Christopher Majka nextug @ ac.dal.ca BTW , if you can reply via EMail I would be grateful . I don't often read this newsgroup . I will post a summary of answers .

Since they are n't fixed in position on their stainless steel pins , you might try sliding them into a slightly different position . On my PowerBook 100 , I can slide them almost completely out of contact with the trackball . In fact , one of the notes from sumex on fixing the trackball advocates sliding the roller so that its _edge_ contacts the ball , not the center cylindrical area . I 've done this with my PB100 , and it does seem to improve the feel , but needs to be adjusted from time to time . I just popped open one of our office 's PB170s , and while there is n't as much latitude for movement , one could still adjust the roller slightly . If your PB140 is the same it might help . I would suspect the most likely culprit to be a slippery blue roller . If you can take it out , clean it with a mild soapy solution , or isopropyl alcohol . Also , be sure the ball is grease-free . If you drop the ball in minus the retaining ring , roll the ball and see if it is actually causing the axle to spin . If all this still does n't solve it , then maybe a new one is in order . : - ( It could be an electrical connection , in which case replacement would be necessary . But my experience with both mice and trackballs has been that dirt has been the normal problem , not an electrical malfunction . Hope this helps , Murray -- Murray M.

From : mcelwre @ cnsvax.uwec.edu Subject : NATURAL ANTI-cancer/AIDS Remedies Organization : University of Wisconsin Eau Claire Lines : 224 The biggest reason why the cost of medical care is so EXTREMELY high and increasing is that NATURAL methods of treatment and even diagnosis are still being SYSTEMATICALLY IGNORED and SUPPRESSED by the MONEY-GRUBBING and POWER- MONGERING `` medical '' establishment . Some examples of very low cost NATURAL ANTI-cancer Remedies are listed in the following article : NATURAL ANTI-CANCER REMEDIES A 3RD OPINION ( Some of these Remedies also work against AIDS . ) DISCLAIMER : This list was compiled from unorthodox sources that have shown themselves to be reliable . The compiler of this list is NOT a doctor of any kind , but is exercising his First Amendment Constitutional RIGHT of FREE SPEECH on the subjects of his choice . ( MOST of these Remedies can be found in ANY Grocery Store . MOST of the rest of them can be found in ANY Health Food Store . What is important is HOW they are used , and what else is EXCLUDED DURING their use . ) ( 1 ) THE 7-DAY FAST . 1st day : Eat as much fresh fruit as you want , one kind at a time , preferably grapes . 2nd day : Eat all the vegetables you want , at least half raw , including GARLIC ; also , whole kernel corn to help scrape clean the intestinal linings . 3rd day : Drink all the fresh fruit and vegetable juice you want . Preferably start with 16 to 32 ounces of prune juice WITH PULP , followed by a gallon of pure ( NOT from concentrate ) apple juice , then grape juice . ( Stay close to your home bathroom . ) 4th day : Eat all the UN-salted nuts ( NO peanuts ) and dried fruit you want , preferably raisins and almonds ( ALMONDS CONTAIN LAETRILE. ) . 5th day : ONE GALLON OF LEMONADE . Squeeze the juice from two lemons into a gallon of water ( preferably distilled ) , and add 2 to 4 tablespoons of locally-made honey , ( NO sugar ) . Drink one glass per hour . [ EVERYone , including healthy people , should do this one day every week , preceded by a large glass of prune juice WITH PULP . ] 6th day : Same as 5th day . 7th day : Same as 6th day . All 7 days , eat ONLY the foods listed above for each day , along with your usual vitamin and mineral supplements , plus as much DISTILLED WATER as you want . ( 2 ) THE GRAPE DIET . Eat 2 to 3 ounces of fresh grapes every 2 hours , 8 AM to 8 PM , every day for six days . Eat NOTHING else during the six days , but drink as much DISTILLED WATER as you want . ( 3 ) APPLE CIDER VINEGAR . Mix a teaspoon of pure apple cider vinegar ( NOT apple cider `` flavored '' vinegar . Regular vinegar is HARMFUL . ) in a glass of water ( preferably distilled ) and drink all of it . Do this 3 or 4 times per day , for 3 weeks ; then stop for a week . Repeat if desired . Do this along with a normal healthy diet of natural foods . This remedy is especially effective against those types of cancer that resemble a FUNGUS , as well as against other kinds of fungus infections . ( 4 ) THE SEA-SALT & SODA BATH . [ Please keep an OPEN MIND . ] Fill a bathtub with moderately warm water so the level comes up almost to the overflow drain when you get in . Immerse yourself in it for a minute , and then completely dissolve in the bath water 1 pound of SUN-evaporated SEA-salt ( regular salt wo n't work . ) and 1 pound of fresh baking-soda . Soak in this bath for 10 to 20 minutes , while exercising your fingers , toes , and limbs , turning sideways and onto your stomach , dunking your head , sitting up and laying back down , chomping your teeth together , etc.. Among other things , the SEA-salt & Soda Bath neutralizes the accumulated effects of X-rays , etc. , as described in the book `` Born To Be Magnetic , Vol . 2 '' , by Frances Nixon , 1973 . PRECAUTIONS : Only the ONE person using each bath should prepare it and drain it . For at least 30 minutes after taking the bath , stay away from , and even out of sight of , other people . ( Your greatly expanded Aura energy-field during that time could disrupt other people 's fields . ) Two hours after the bath , eat at least 8 ounces of yogurt containing ACTIVE Yogurt Cultures . ( The bath may kill FRIENDLY bacteria also . ) Better yet , take a 2-Billion-bacteria `` Acidophilus '' capsule , which is also an EXCELLENT DAILY REMEDY AGAINST THE EFFECTS OF `` A.I.D.S . '' ( because it kills all kinds of harmful bacteria in the digestive tract , taking a big load off the remaining immune system ) . [ Because this external bath can kill IN-ternal bacteria , it may also be a CURE for `` Lyme disease '' . ] Do NOT take this bath within a few hundred miles of a thunder storm , within 3 days of a full moon , nor during `` Major '' or `` Minor Periods '' as listed in the `` Solunar Tables '' published bimonthly in `` Field & Stream '' Magazine , ( because of the measurable disruptive ambient environmental energy-fields present at those times ) . Do NOT take this bath more than four times per year . ( 5 ) MISCELLANEOUS NATURAL ANTI-CANCER REMEDIES : For skin cancer , apply STABILIZED Aloe Vera Jel to the affected skin twice daily , and take 2 to 4 tablespoons per day of STABILIZED Aloe Vera Juice internally , for about 2 months . D.M.S.O . ( Dimethyl Sulfoxide ) causes cancer cells to perform NORMAL cell functions . ALMONDS ( UN-blanched , UN-roasted ) CONTAIN LAETRILE . To help prevent cancer , eat several almonds every day . To help cure cancer , eat several OUNCES of almonds per day . [ NEVER take large concentrated doses of Laetrile orally . IT WILL KILL YOU ! Take it INTRAVENOUSLY ONLY . ( Cancer cells contain a certain enzyme which converts Laetrile into cyanide , which then kills the cell . This enzyme is ALSO present in the digestive system . ) ] ANTI-OXIDANTS are FREE-RADICAL SCAVENGERS , and include Vitamin E , Selenium ( 200 mcg . per day is safe for most people . ) , Chromium ( up to 100 mcg . per day ) , Vitamin A ( 25,000 IU per day is safe for most people . ) , Superoxide Dismutase ( up to 4,000,000 Units per day ) , Vitamin C ( up to 3000 mg. per day ) , and BHT ( Butylated Hydroxy- toluene ) , [ 1 to 4 capsules of BHT every night at bedtime will also MAKE ONE IMMUNE AGAINST HERPES ( BOTH types ) , suppress herpes symptoms if one already has herpes , prevent spreading herpes to other people , but will not cure herpes . BHT MIGHT ALSO DO THESE THINGS AGAINST `` A.I.D.S . `` , which is really a form of cancer similar to leukemia . ] ( See the book `` Life Extension '' , by Durk Pearson and Sandy Shaw . ) HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE . Dilute twelve ( 12 ) drops of 3 % hydrogen-peroxide in a glass of pure water ( preferably DISTILLED ) and drink it . Do this once or twice per day , hours before or after eating or drinking anything else . Apply 3 % hydrogen-peroxide directly to skin cancers several times per day . Use hydrogen-peroxide ONLY if you are taking a good daily dose of some of the various anti-oxidants described above . VITAMIN & MINERAL SUPPLEMENTS are more effective , and much less expensive , when COMBINED together in MEGA doses into SINGLE tablets made from NATURAL sources . Cancer cells can NOT live in a strong ( 100,000 Maxwell ) NORTH MAGNETIC FIELD , especially if it is pulsating on and off . [ A strong south magnetic field is an aphrodisiac . ] In my opinion , ALL types of ionizing- radiation treatments for cancer should be REPLACED with daily 30-minute doses of pulsating 100,000-Maxwell NORTH magnetic fields . Properly made and operated RADIONICS/PSIONICS MACHINES can both diagnose and cure all forms of cancer , as well as most other medical problems . Some Radionics/Psionics Machines can even take cross-sectional X-ray-like photos of cancer tumors , etc. , with-OUT X-rays ! INTERFERON tablets . TAHEEBO TEA , ( Lapacho ) . HOMEOPATHY can cure cancer , and many other medical problems ( even drug addiction ! ) . 50 mg. per day of CHELATED ZINC can help prevent or cure prostate trouble . This list is NOT exhaustive . The above NATURAL Remedies can CURE both diagnosed AND UN- DIAGNOSED cancers , as well as PREVENT them , and also prevent and cure many other medical problems including heart- diseases . They are NOT too simple and inexpensive to work effectively . Besides acting on a person biologically and chemically , these remedies , especially The 7-Day Fast and The Grape Diet , send a strong message to one 's subconscious mind , PROGRAMMING it to CURE the cancer . In my opinion , if a person finds out that s/he has cancer , then s/he should promptly try at least the first 4 remedies described above , in sequence ( starting with The 7-Day Fast ) , BEFORE resorting to the UN-natural and expensive mutilations and agonies [ POISON , BURN , and MUTILATE ! ] of orthodox cancer treatment [ organi $ ed-CRIME ! ] .

It was for the purpose of establishing a state , not an exclusive state . If the state was to be exclusive , it would not have 400 000 arab citizens . And no , I do not consider the purchase of land a hostile action . When someone wants to buy land , and someone else is willing to sell it , at a mutually agreeable price , then that is commerce .

Try again , you tell me what its is n't , but you fail to establish what it is . Also , Jews did have history in Israel for over a thousand years .

Helsingius ? * * * IDENTITY ======== _____ < 1.1 > What is ` identity ' on the internet ? Generally , today people 's ` identity ' on the internet is primarily determined by their email address in the sense that this is their most unchanging 'face ' in the electronic realm . This is your login name qualified by the complete address domain information , for example `` ld231782 @ longs.lance.colostate.edu '' . People see this address when receiving mail or reading USENET posts from you and in other situations where programs record usage . Some obsolete forms of addresses ( such as BITNET ) still persist . In email messages , additional information on the path that a message takes is prepended to the message received by the recipient . This information identifies the chain of hosts involved in the transmission and is a very accurate trace of its origination . This type of identify-and-forward protocol is also used in the USENET protocol to a lesser extent . Forging these fields requires corrupted mailing software at sites involved in the forwarding and is very uncommon . Not so uncommon is forging the chain at the origination point , so that all initial sites in the list are faked at the time the message is created . Tracing these messages can be difficult or impossible when the initial faked fields are names of real machines and represent real transfer routes . _____ < 1.2 > Why is identity ( un ) important on the internet ? The concept of identity is closely intertwined with communication , privacy , and security , which in turn are all critical aspects of computer networks . For example , the convenience of communication afforded by email would be impossible without conventions for identification . But there are many potential abuses of identity possible that can have very severe consequences , with massive computer networks at the forefront of the issue , which can potentially either exacerbate or solve these problems . Verifying that an identity is correct is called ` authentication ' , and one classic example of the problems associated with it is H.G.Well 's `` War of the Worlds '' radio broadcast that fooled segments of the population into thinking that an alien invasion was in progress . Hoaxes of this order are not uncommon on Usenet and forged identities makes them more insidious . People and their reputations can be assaulted by forgery . However , the fluidity of identity on the internet is for some one of its most attractive features . Identity is just as useful as it is harmful . A professor might carefully explain a topic until he finds he is talking to an undergraduate . A person of a particular occupation may be able to converse with others who might normally shun him . Some prejudices are erased , but , on the other hand , many prejudices are useful ! A scientist might argue he can better evaluate the findings of a paper as a reviewer if he knows more about the authors . Likewise , he may be more likely to reject it based on unfair or irrelevant criteria . On the other side of the connection , the author may find identities of reviewers useful in exerting pressure for acceptance . Identity is especially crucial in establishing and regulating ` credit ' ( not necessarily financial ) and ` ownership ' and ` usage ' . Many functions in society demand reliable and accurate techniques for identification . Heavy reliance will be placed on digital authentication as global economies become increasingly electronic . Many government functions and services are based on identification , and law enforcement frequently hinges on it . Hence , employees of many government organizations push toward stronger identification structures . But when does identification invade privacy ? The growth of the internet is provoking social forces of massive proportions . Decisions made now on issues of identity will affect many future users , especially as the network becomes increasingly global , universal , widespread , and entrenched ; and the positive or adverse affects of these actions , intended and inadvertent , will literally be magnified exponentially . _____ < 1.3 > How does my email address ( not ) identify me and my background ? Your email address may contain information that influences people's perceptions of your background . The address may ` identify ' you as from a department at a particular university , an employee at a company , or a government worker . It may contain your last name , initials , or cryptic identification codes independent of both . In the US some are based on parts of social security numbers . Others are in the form 'u2338 ' where the number is incremented in the order that new users are added to the system . Standard internet addresses also can contain information on your broad geographical location or nationhood . However , none of this information is guaranteed to be correct or be there at all . The fields in the domain qualification of the username are based on rather arbitrary organization , such as ( mostly invisible ) network cabling distributions . The only point to make is that early fields in the address are more specific ( such as specific computer names or local networks ) and the later ones the most general ( such as continental domains ) . Typically the first field is the name of the computer receiving mail . Gleaning information from the email address alone is sometimes an inspired art or an inconsistent and futile exercise . ( For more information , see the FAQs on email addresses and known geographical distributions below . ) However , UNIX utilities exist to aid in the quest ( see the question on this ) . Common Suffixes -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - .us United States .uk United Kingdom .ca Canada .fi Finland .au Australia .edu university or college .com commercial organization .org 'other ' ( e.g . nonprofit organization ) .gov government .mil military site _____ < 1.4 > How can I find out more about somebody with a given email address ? One simple way is to send email to that address , asking . Another way is to send mail to the postmaster at that address ( i.e . postmaster @ address ) , although the postmaster 's job is more to help find user ID 's of particular people given their real name and solve mail routing problems . The sysadmin ( i.e . ` root @ address ' ) may also be able to supply information . Users with related email address may have information . However , all of these methods rely on the time and patience of others so use them minimally . One of the most basic tools for determining identity over the internet is the UNIX utility 'finger ' . The basic syntax is : finger user @ here.there.everywhere This utility uses communication protocols to query the computer named in the address for information on the user named . The response is generated completely by the receiving computer and may be in any format . Possible responses are as follows : - A message ` unknown host ' meaning some aspect of the address is incorrect , two lines with no information and ' ? ? ? ' . - A message 'In real life : ? ? ? ' in which case the receiving computer could not find any kind of a match on the username . The finger utility may return this response in other situations . - A listing of information associated with multiple users . Some computers will search only for matching user IDs , others will attempt to find the username you specified as a substring of all actual full names of users kept in a local database . At some sites 'finger ' can be used to get a list of all users on the system with a ` finger @ address ' . In general this is often considered weak security , however , because ` attackers ' know valid user ID 's to ` crack ' passwords . More information on the fields returned by ` finger ' is given below . More information on ` finger ' and locating people 's email addresses is given in the email FAQ ( such as the WHOIS lookup utility ) . Just as you can use these means to find out about others , they can use them to find out about you . You can ` finger ' yourself to find out what is publicly reported by your UNIX system about you . Be careful when modifying ` finger ' data ; virtually anyone with internet access worldwide can query this information . In one amazing case , the New York Times writer J. Markoff uncovered the identity of R. Morris , author of the Internet Worm , through the use of an anonymous tip and 'finger ' . See the book Cyberspace by K. Hafner and J. Markoff . _____ < 1.5 > Why is identification ( un ) stable on the internet ? Generally , identity is an amorphous and almost nonexistent concept on the Internet for a variety of reasons . One is the inherent fluidity of ` cyberspace ' where people emerge and submerge frequently , and absences are not readily noted in the ` community ' . Most people remember faces and voices , the primary means of casual identification in the 'real world ' . The arbitary and cryptic sequences of letters and digits comprising most email addresses are not particularly noticeable or memorable and far from a unique identification of an individual , who may use multiple accounts on multiple machines anywhere in the world . Currently internet users do not really have any great assurances that the messages in email and USENET are from who they appear to be . A person 's mailing address is far from an identification of an individual . - Anyone with access to the account , e.g . they know the password , either legitimately or otherwise , can send mail with that address in the From : line . - Email addresses for an individual tend to change frequently as they switch jobs or make moves inside their organizations . - As part of current mailing protocol standards , forging the From : line in mail messages is a fairly trivial operation for many hackers . The status and path information prepended to messages by intermediate hosts is generally unforgeable . In general , while possible , forgeries are fairly rare on most newsgroups and in email . Besides these pathological cases abve there are many basic problems with today 's internet protocols affecting identification on the internet : - Internet mail standards , described in RFC-822 , are still evolving rapidly and not entirely orderly . For example , standards for mail address ` munging ' or ` parsing ' tend to vary slightly between sites and frequently mean the difference between finding addresses and bouncing mail . - Domain names and computer names are frequently changed at sites , and there are delays in the propagation of this data . - Addresses can not be resolved when certain critical computers crash , such as the receiving computer or other computers involved in resolving names into addresses called ` nameservers ' . - A whole slew of problems is associated with ` nameservers ' ; if they are not updated they will not find name addresses , and even the operation of what constitutes ` updating ' has different interpretations at different sites . The current internet mailing and addressing protocols are slightly anachronistic in that they were created when the network was somewhat obscure and not widespread , with only a fraction of the traffic it now sees . Today a large proportion of internet traffic is email , comprising millions of messages . _____ < 1.6 > What is the future of identification on the internet ? Some new technologies and standards are introducing facial images and voice messages into mail and these will improve the sense of community that comes from the familiarity of identification . However , they are not currently widespread , require large amounts of data transfer , standardized software , and make some compromises in privacy . Promising new cryptographic techniques may make 'digital signatures' and 'digital authentication ' common ( see below ) . Also , the trend in USENET standards is toward greater authentication of posted information . On the other hand , advances in ensuring anonymity ( such as remailers ) are forthcoming . See below . PRIVACY ======= _____ < 2.1 > What is ` privacy ' on the internet ? Generally , while ` privacy ' has multiple connotations in society and perhaps even more on the internet , in cyberspace most take it to mean that you have exclusive use and access to your account and the data stored on and and directed to it ( such as email ) , and you do not encounter arbitrary restrictions or searches . In other words , others may obtain data associated with your account , but not without your permission . These ideas are probably both fairly limiting and liberal in their scope in what most internet users consider their private domains . Some users do n't expect or want any privacy , some expect and demand it . _____ < 2.2 > Why is privacy ( un ) important on the internet ? This is a somewhat debatable and inflammatory topic , arousing passionate opinions . On the internet , some take privacy for granted and are rudely surprised to find it tenuous or nonexistent . Most governments have rules that protect privacy ( such as the illegal search and seizure clause of the U.S. constitution , adopted by others ) but have many that are antithetical to it ( such as laws prohibiting secret communications or allowing wiretapping ) . These rules generally carry over to the internet with few specific rules governing it . However , the legal repercussions of the global internet are still largely unknown and untested ( i.e . no strong legal precedents and court cases ) . The fact that internet traffic frequently passes past international boundaries , and is not centrally managed , significantly complicates and strongly discourages its regulation . _____ < 2.3 > How ( in ) secure are internet networks ? - ` Theoretically ' people at any site in the chain of sites with access to hardware and network media that transmits data over the Internet could potentially monitor or archive it . However , the sheer volume and general 'noise ' inherent to this data makes these scenarios highly improbable , even by government agencies with supposedly vast funding and resources . - Technologies exist to ` tap ' magnetic fields given off by electrical wires without detection . Less obscurely , any machine with a network connection is a potential station for traffic detection , but this scenario requires knowledge and access to very low-level hardware ( the network card ) to pursue , if even possible . - A company Network General Inc. is one of many that manufactures and markets sophisticated network monitoring tools that can 'filter ' and read packets by arbitrary criteria for troubleshooting purposes , but the cost of this type of device is prohibitive for casual use . Known instances of the above types of security breaches at a major scale ( such as at network hubs ) are very rare . The greatest risks tend to emerge locally . Note that all these approaches are almost completely defused with the use of cryptography . _____ < 2.4 > How ( in ) secure is my account ? By default , not very . There are a multitude of factors that may reinforce or compromise aspects of your privacy on the internet . First , your account must be secure from other users . The universal system is to use a password , but if it is ` weak ' ( i.e . easy to guess ) this security is significantly diminished . Somewhat surprisingly and frighteningly to some , certain users of the system , particularly the administrator , generally have unlimited access regardless of passwords , and may grant that access to others . This means that they may read any file in your account without detection . Furthermore , not universally known , most UNIX systems keep fairly extensive accounting records of when and where you logged in , what commands you execute , and when they are executed ( in fact , login information is usually public ) . Most features of this ` auditing ' or ` process accounting ' information are enabled by default after the initial installation and the system administrator may customize it to strengthen or weaken it to satisfy performance or privacy aims . This information is frequently consulted for troubleshooting purposes and may otherwise be ignored . This data tracks unsuccessful login attempts and other 'suspicious ' activities on the system . A traditional part of the UNIX system that tracks user commands is easily circumvented by the user with the use of symbolic links ( described in 'man ln ' ) . UNIX implementations vary widely particularly in tracking features and new sophisticated mechanisms are introduced by companies regularly . Typically system adminstrators augment the basic UNIX functionality with public-domain programs and locally-developed tools for monitoring , and use them only to isolate ` suspicious' activity as it arises ( e.g . remote accesses to the 'passwd ' file , incorrect login attempts , remote connection attempts , etc. ) . Generally , you should expect little privacy on your account for various reasons : - Potentially , every keystroke you type could be intercepted by someone else . - System administrators make extensive backups that are completely invisible to users which may record the states of an account over many weeks . - Erased files can , under many operating systems , be undeleted . - Most automated services keep logs of use for troubleshooting or otherwise ; for example FTP sites usually log the commands and record the domain originations of users , including anonymous ones . - Some software exacerbates these problems . See the section on `` X Windows ( in ) security '' . Indepedent of malevolent administrators are fellow users , a much more commonly harmful threat . There are multiple ways to help ensure that your account will not be accessed by others , and compromises can often be traced to failures in these guidelines : - Choose a secure password . Change it periodically . - Make sure to logout always . - Do not leave a machine unattended for long . - Make sure no one watches you when you type your password . - Avoid password references in email . - Be conservative in the use of the .rhost file . - Use utilities like ` xlock ' to protect a station , but be considerate . Be wary of situations where you think you should supply your password . There are only several basic situations where UNIX prompts you for a password : when you are logging in to a system or changing your password . Situations can arise in which prompts for passwords are forged by other users , especially in cases where you are talking to them ( such as Internet Relay Chat ) . Also , be aware that forged login screens are one method to illegitimately obtain passwords . ( Thanks to Jim Mattson < mattson @ cs.ucsd.edu > for contributions here . ) _____ < 2.5 > How ( in ) secure are my files and directories ? The most important privacy considerations are related to file rights , and many lapses can be traced to their misunderstood nature or haphazard maintenance . Be aware of the rights associated with your files and directories in UNIX . If the ` x ' ( ` execute ' ) right on your parent directory is off for users , groups , and other , these users can not gain information on anything in your directories . Anything less may allow others to read , change , or even delete files in your home directory . The rights on a directory supersede the rights associated with files in that directory . For a directory , ' x ' means that access to the files ( or subdirectories ) in the directory is possible -- if you know their names . To list the contents of the directory , however , requires the ' r ' right . By default most accounts are accessable only to the owner , but the initial configuration varies between sites based on administrator preference . The default file mode specifies the initial rights associated with newly created files , and can be set in the shell with ` umask ' . The details of rights implementations tend to vary between versions of UNIX . Consult man pages on ` chmod ' and ` ls ' . Examples -- -- -- -- traver.lance % ls -ld ~ drwx -- -- -- 15 ld231782 1536 Jan 31 21:22 /users/ld231782/ Here is a listing of the rights associated with a user 's home directory , denoted by ` ~ ' . The columns at the left identify what rights are available . The first column identifies the entry as a directory , and the next three columns mean that read , write , and execute rights , respectively , are permitted for that user . For directories , the ` x ' right means that contents ( file and subdirectory names ) within that directory can be listed . The subsequent columns indicate that no other users have any rights to anything in the directory tree originating at that point . They ca n't even ` see ' any lower files or subdirectories ; the hierarchy is completely invisible to them . traver.lance % ls -l msg -rw-r -- r -- 1 ld231782 35661 Jan 29 23:13 msg traver.lance % chmod u=rw , g= , o= msg traver.lance % ls -l msg -rw -- -- -- - 1 ld231782 35661 Jan 29 23:13 msg Here the modes on the file ` msg ' were changed to take away rights from ` group ' and ` other ' . Note that ` ls -l < file > ' requires both the ' r ' right to get the list of files and subdirectories , and the ' x ' right to access the files and subdirectories in order to get their size , etc . For example , suppose the directory ` foo ' has rights dr -- r -- r -- , the following is possible : ls foo These commands would fail independent of file rights : ls -l foo ls -l foo/file cat foo/file cd foo If the directory ` foo ' has rights d -- x -- x -- x , the following are possible if it is known beforehand that ` foo ' contains an ' r' readable file named ` file ' : ls -l foo/file cat foo/file cd foo The following commands fail : ls foo ls -l foo ( Thanks to Uwe Waldmann < uwe @ mpi-sb.mpg.de > for contributions here . ) _____ < 2.6 > How ( in ) secure is X Windows ? X Windows is the primary software developed by the MIT Athena project which is funded by U.S. government grants to develop applications to harness the power of networks in enhancing computational tasks , particularly the human-computer interface . The software implements a client-server interface to a computer via graphical windows . In this case the ` client ' is the application requesting or utilizing graphical resources ( such as windows or a mouse ) and the ` server ' is the machine that provides them . In many situations the client is an application program running on the same machine as the server . The great utility of X Windows comes from its complete dissociation of the client and server so that windows may be ` broadcast ' to a server at a remote location from the client . Unfortunately this dynamic power also introduces many deep , intricate , and complicated security considerations . The primary security and privacy issue associated with X Windows is that much more sensitive data may be sent over a network , and over wider regions , than in the case where the human is situated near the host computer . Currently there is no encryption of data such as screen updates and keystrokes in X Windows . Due to either intentional design decisions or unintentional design flaws , early versions of the X Window system are extremely insecure . Anyone with an account on the server machine can disrupt that display or read it electronically based on access to the device unix:0.0 by any regular user . There are no protections from this type of access in these versions . The problem arises because the security is completely based on machine addresses rather than users , such that any user at a ` trusted ' machine is himself trusted . Quoting from X documentation ( man Xsecurity ) : > Any client on a host in the host access control list is allowed > access to the X server . This system can work reasonably well in > an environment where everyone trusts everyone , or when only a > single person can log into a given machine ... This system does not > work well when multiple people can log in to a single machine and > mutual trust does not exist . With the access control list , the ` xhost ' command may prevent some naive attempts ( i.e . those other than the direct-access unix:0.0 evasion ) ; the syntax as typed on the host machine is `` xhost + [ name ] '' where [ name ] is the domain name or internet address of an authorized client machine . By default clients running nonlocal to the host are disabled . Public domain programs to disrupt a display momentarily ( such as 'flip ' or slowly mirror the screen image , or cause pixels to 'melt ' down to the bottom ) have been circulating on the internet among hackers for several years and played as pranks on unsuspecting or inexperienced users . Much more serious security breaches are conceivable from similar mechanisms exploiting this inherent weaknesses . ( The minimal , easily-bypassed ` trusted' security mode of ` xhost ' has been jokingly referred to as `` X Hanging Open , Security Terrible. '' ) . New versions of the X Window system ( X11R5 and higher ) by default make server access as secure as the file system using a .Xauthority file and 'magic cookies ' . Remote machines must have a code in the .Xauthority file in the home directory that matches the code allowed by the server . Many older programs and even new vendor-supplied code does not support or is incompatible with ` magic cookies ' . The basic magic cookie mechanism is vulnerable to monitoring techniques described earlier because no encryption of keys occurs in transmission . X11R5 also includes other sophisticated encryption mechanisms . Try ` man Xsecurity ' to find out what is supported at your site . Even though improved security mechanisms have been available in X Windows since ~1990 , local sites often update this software infrequently because installation is extremely complex . ( Thanks to Marc Vanheyningen < mvanheyn @ whale.cs.indiana.edu > , Jim Mattson < mattson @ cs.ucsd.edu > , and Bill Marshall < marshall @ cs.iastate.edu > for contributions here . ) _____ < 2.7 > How ( in ) secure is my email ? By default , not very . The characters that you are reading are almost certainly encoded in ASCII , the American Standard Code for Information Interchange that maps alphabetic and symbolic characters onto numeric codes and vice versa . Virtually every computer system uses this code , and if not , has ways of converting to and from it . When you write a mail message , by default it is being sent in ASCII , and since the standard is virtually universal , there is no intrinsic privacy . Despite milleniums worth of accumulated cryptographic knowledge , cryptographic technologies are only recently being established that afford high priority to privacy as a primary criteria in computer and network design . Some potential pitfalls in privacy are as follows : - The most serious threats are instances of immature or unscrupulous system operators reading private mail in the ` spool files ' at a local site ( i.e . at the source or destination of the message ) , such as a university . - System administrators may also release files to law enforcement agencies , but conventions and protocols for warrants involving computer searches have still not been strongly established and tested legally . - Note that bounced messages go to postmasters at a given site in their entirety . This means that if you address mail with an incorrect address it has a good chance of being seen by a human other than the recipient . - Typically new user accounts are always set up such that the local mail directory is private , but this is not guaranteed and can be overridden . - Finally , be aware that some mailing lists ( email addresses of everyone on a list ) are actually publicly accessable via mail routing software mechanisms . This ` feature ' can be disabled . Most potential compromises in email privacy can be thoroughly avoided with the use of strong end-to-end cryptography , which has its own set of caveats ( for example , unscrupulous administrators may still be a threat if the encryption site is shared or nonlocal ) . See the sections on `` email privacy '' and `` email policies . '' _____ < 2.8 > How am I ( not ) liable for my email and postings ? As punishment or whatever , your system administrator can revoke certain ` privileges ' such as emailing , USENET posting or reading certain groups , file transferring , remote communications , or generally any subset of capabilities available from your account . This all is completely at the discretion of the local administrator and under the procedures followed at a particular site , which in many cases are haphazard and crisis-oriented . Currently there are virtually no widespread , uniform guidelines or procedures for restricting use to any internet services , and local administrators are free to make arbitrary decisions on access . Today punitive measures are regularly applied in various situations . In the typical scenario complaint ( s ) reach a system adminstrator regarding abuses by a user , usually but not necessarily preceded by complaints to the user in email , regarding that person's objectionable email or postings . ` abusive ' posters to USENET are usually first given admonitions from their system administrators as urged by others on the ` net ' . ( The debate persists endlessly on many newsgroups whether this is also used as a questionable means of attacking or silencing ` harmless crackpots ' or censoring unpopular opinions . ) System administrators at remote sites regularly cooperate to 'squelch ' severe cases of abuse . In general , however , by tradition Usenet readers are remarkably tolerant of diverse views and uses of the system , but a colorful vocabularly of slang helps describe their alternatives when this patience is sapped : the options wielded by the individual user are to simply advance to the next message ( referred to as `` hitting the ` n ' key '' ) , or to ` plonk' annoying posters ( according to the Hacker 's Dictionary , the sound a jerk makes at the end of a fall to the bottom of a kill file ) . In cases where punitive actions are applied , generally system administrators are least likely to restrict email . USENET postings are much more commonly restricted , either to individual users or entire groups ( such as a university campus ) . Restrictions are most commonly associated with the following ` abuses ' : - harassing or threatening notes , ` email terrorism' - illegal uses , e.g . piracy or propagation of copyrighted material - ` ad hominem ' attacks , i.e . insulting the reputation of the poster instead of citing the content of the message - intentional or extreme vulgarity and offensiveness - inappropriate postings , esp . binary files in regular groups ` mail-bombing ' : inundating mail boxes with numerous or massive files Major problems originate from lack of distinctions in private and official email or postings . Most users have internet access via accounts at businesses or universities and their activities on the internet can be construed as representative of their parent organizations . Many people put disclaimers in their ` signatures ' in an attempt dissociate their identity and activities from parent organizations as a precaution . A recent visible political case involves the privacy of electronic mail written by White House staff members of the Bush administration . Following are some guidelines : - Acquaint yourself with your company or university policy . - If possible , avoid use of your company email address for private communication . - Use a disclaimer . - Keep a low profile ( avoid ` flamewars ' or simply do n't post ) . - Avoid posting information that could be construed to be proprietary or ` internal ' . The following references are available from ftp.eff.com ( see also the section on `` internet use policies '' ) : /pub/academic/banned.1991 /pub/academic/banned.1992 -- - Computer material that was banned/challenged in academia in 1991 and 1992 including USENET hierarchies . /pub/academic/cases -- - This is an on-line collection of information about specific computers and academic freedom cases . File README is a detailed description of the items in the directory . /pub/academic/faq/netnews.liability -- - Notes on university liability for Usenet . _____ < 2.9 > How do I provide more/less information to others on my identity ? The public information of your identity and account is mostly available though the UNIX utility ` finger ' described above . - You have control over most of this information with the utility ` chfn ' , the specifics vary between sites ( on some systems use ` passwd -f ' ) . - You can provide unlimited information in the .plan file which is copied directly to the destination during the fingering . - A technique that works at some sites allows you to find out who is 'finger'ing you and even to vary the .plan file sent to them . - Your signature is determined by the environment variable SIGNATURE - USENET signatures are conventionally stored in the .signature file in your home directory . Providing less information on your online identity is more difficult and involved . One approach is to ask your system adminstrator to change or delete information about you ( such as your full name ) . You may be able to obtain access on a public account or one from someone unrelated to you personally . You may be able to remotely login ( via modem or otherwise ) to computers that you are not physically near . These are tactics for hiding or masking your online activities but nothing is foolproof . Consult man pages on the 'chmod ' command and the default file mode . Generally , files on a shared system have good safeguards within the user pool but very little protection is possible from corrupt system administrators . To mask your identity in email or on USENET you can use different accounts . More untraceable are new ` anonymous posting ' and remailing services that are very recently being established . See below . ______ < 2.10 > Who is my sysadmin ? What does s/he know about me ? The requirements and screening for getting a system administration job ( and thereby access to all information on a system ) vary widely between sites and are sometimes frighteningly lax , especially at universities . Many UNIX systems at universities are largely managed by undergraduates with a background in computing and often ` hacking ' . In general , commercial and industrial sites are more strict on qualifications and background , and government sites are extremely strict . The system adminstrator ( root user ) can monitor what commands you used and at what times . S/he may have a record ( backups ) of files on your account over a few weeks . S/he can monitor when you send email or post USENET messages , and potentially read either . S/he may have access to records indicating what hosts you are using , both locally and elsewhere . Administrators sometimes employ specialized programs to track ` strange ' or ` unusual ' activity , which can potentially be misused . ______ < 2.11 > Why is privacy ( un ) stable on the internet ? For the numerous reasons listed above , privacy should not be an expectation with current use of the internet . Furthermore , large parts of the internet are funded by the U.S. NSF ( National Science Foundation ) which places certain restrictions on its use ( such as prohibiting commercial use ) . Some high-level officials in this and other government agencies may be opposed to emerging techniques to guarantee privacy ( such as encryption and anonymous services ) . Historically the major threats to privacy on the internet have been local . Perhaps the most common example of this are the widespread occurrences of university administrators refusing to carry some portion of USENET newsgroups labelled as ` pornographic ' . The ` alternative ' hierarchy in the USENET system , which has virtually no restrictions on propagation and new group creation , is frequently targeted ( although this material may appear anywhere ) . From the global point of view traffic is generally completely unimpeded on the internet and only the most egregious offenders are pursued . For example , verbatim transcriptions of copyrighted material ( such as newspaper or magazine articles ) are posted to USENET with regularity without major consequences ( some email complaints may ensue ) . More astonishing to some is that currently significant portions of USENET traffic , and less so internet traffic , is comprised of sexually-explicit digitized images almost entirely originating from copyrighted material ( newsgroups such as ` alt.sex ' regularly have the highest traffic ) . ______ < 2.12 > What is the future of privacy on the internet ? Some argue that the internet currently has an adequate or appropriate level of privacy . Others will argue that as a prototype for future global networks it has woefully inadequate safeguards . The internet is growing to become a completely global , international superhighway for data , and this traffic will inevitably entail data such as voice messages , postal mail , and many other items of extremely personal nature . Computer items that many people consider completely private ( such as their local hard drives ) will literally be inches from global network connections . Also , sensitive industrial and business information is exchanged over networks currently and this volume may conceivably merge with the internet . Most would agree that , for these basic but sensitive uses of the internet , no significant mechanisms are currently in place to ensure much privacy . New standards are calling for uniform introduction of ` privacy enhanced mail ' ( PEM ) which uses encryption technologies to ensure privacy , so that privacy protection is automatic , and may significantly improve safeguards . The same technology that can be extremely destructive to privacy ( such as with surreptitious surveilance ) can be overwhelmingly effective in protecting it ( e.g . with encryption ) . Some government agencies are opposed to unlimited privacy in general , and believe that it should lawfully be forfeited in cases of criminal conduct ( e.g . court-authorized wiretapping ) . However , powerful new technologies to protect privacy on computers are becoming increasingly popular , provoking some to say that `` the cat is out of the bag '' and the `` genie ca n't be put back in the bottle '' . In less idiomatic terms , they believe that the spread of strong cryptography is already underway will be socially and technically unstoppable . To date , no feasible system that guarantees both secure communication and government oversight has been proposed ( the two goals are largely incompatible ) . Proposals for `` registration '' of secret keys ( by D. Denning on sci.crypt , for example ) have been met with hot controversy at best and ridicule and derision at worst , mainly because of concerns for the right to privacy and objections of inherent feasibility . Electronic privacy issues , and particularly the proper roles of networks and the internet , will foreseeably become highly visible and explosive over the next few years . ANONYMITY ========= _____ < 3.1 > What is ` anonymity ' on the internet ? Simply stated , anonymity is the absence of identity , the ultimate in privacy . However , there are several variations on this simple theme . A person may wish to be consistently identified by a certain pseudonym or ` handle ' and establish a reputation under it in some area , providing pseudo-anonymity . A person may wish to be completely untraceable for a single one-way message ( a sort of ` hit-and-run ' ) . Or , a person may wish to be openly anonymous but carry on a conversation with others ( with either known or anonymous identities ) via an ` anonymous return address ' . A user may wish to appear as a ` regular user ' but actually be untraceable . Sometimes a user wishes to hide who he is sending mail to ( in addition to the message itself ) . The anonymous item itself may be directed at individuals or groups . A user may wish to access some service and hide all signs of the association . All of these uses are feasible on the internet but are currently tricky to carry out in practice , because of all the tracking mechanisms inherent to operating systems and network protocols . Officials of the NSF and other government agencies may be opposed to any of these uses because of the potential for abuse . Nevertheless , the inherent facelessness of large networks will always guarantee a certain element of anonymity . _____ < 3.2 > Why is ` anonymity ' ( un ) important on the internet ? Anonymity is another powerful tool that can be beneficial or problematic depending on its use . Arguably absence of identification is important as the presence of it . It may be the case that many strong benefits from electronic anonymity will be discovered that were unforeseen and unpredicted , because true anonymity has been historically very difficult to establish . One can use anonymity to make personal statements to a colleague that would sabotage a relationship if stated openly ( such as employer/employee scenarios ) . One can use it to pass information and evade any threat of direct retribution . For example , ` whistleblowers ' reporting on government abuses ( economic , social , or political ) can bring issues to light without fear of stigma or retaliation . Sensitive , personal , potentially damaging information is often posted to some USENET groups , a risky situation where anonymity allows conversations to be carried on completely independent of the identities of the participants . Some police departments run phone services that allow anonymous reporting of crimes ; such uses would be straightforward on the network . Unfortunately , extortion and harassment become more insidious with assurances of anonymity . _____ < 3.3 > How can anonymity be protected on the internet ? The chief means , as alluded to above , are masking identities in email and posting . However , anonymous accounts ( public accounts as accessable and anonymous as e.g . public telephones ) may be effective as well , but this use is generally not officially supported and even discouraged by some system adminstrators and NSF guidelines . The nonuniformity in the requirements of obtaining accounts at different sites and institutions makes anonymous accounts generally difficult to obtain to the public at large . Many communications protocols are inherently detrimental to anonymity . Virtually every protocol in existence currently contains information on both sender and receiver in every packet . New communications protocols will likely develop that guarantee much higher degrees of secure anonymous communication . _____ < 3.4 > What is ` anonymous mail ' ? One approach to ` anonymizing ' mail has been to set up an ` anonymous server ' that , when activated by email to its address , responds by allocating and supplying an ` anonymous ID ' that is unique to the person requesting it ( based on his email address ) . This will vary for the same person for different machine address email originations . To send anonymous mail , the user sends email directed to the server containing the final destination . The server ` anonymizes ' the message by stripping of identification information and forwards the message , which appears to originate from the anonymous server only from the corresponding anonymous user id . This is the ` interactive ' use of anonymity or pseudonymity mentioned above . Another more ` fringe ' approach is to run a ` cypherpunk ' remailer from a regular user account ( no root system privileges are required ) . These are currently being pioneered by Eric Hughes and Hal Finney < hal @ alumni.caltech.edu > . The operator runs a process on a machine that anonymizes mail sent to him with certain characteristics that distinguish it from his regular incoming mail ( typically fields in the header ) . One has been implemented as a PERL script running on UNIX . Several of these are in existence currently but sites and software currently are highly unstable ; they may be in operation outside of system administrator knowledge . The remailers do n't generally support anonymous return addresses . Mail that is incorrectly addressed is received by the operator . Generally the user of the remailer has to disavow any responsibility for the messages forwarded through his system , although actually may be held liable regardless . These approaches have several serious disadvantages and weaknesses : - The anonymous server approach requires maintaining a mapping of anonymous ID 's to real addresses that must be maintained indefinitely . One alternative is to allow ` deallocation ' of aliases at the request of the user , but this has not been implemented yet . - Although an unlikely scenario , traffic to any of these sites could conceivably be monitored from the ` outside ' , necessitating the use of cryptography for basic protection , . - Local administrators can shut them down either out of caprice or under pressure from local , network , or government agencies . - Unscrupulous providers of the services can monitor the traffic that goes through them . - Most remailers currently keep logs that may be inspected . - The cypherpunk approach tends to be highly unstable because these operators are basically network users who do not own the equipment and are accountable to their own system administrators , who may be unaware of the use and unsympathetic to the philosophy of anonymity when the operation is discovered , regarding it as illicit use . - In all cases , a high degree of trust is placed in the anonymous server operator by the user . Currently the most direct route to anonymity involves using SMTP protocols to submit a message directly to a server with arbitrary field information . This practice , not uncommon to hackers , and the approach used by remailers , is generally viewed with hostility by most system administrators . Information in the header routing data and logs of network port connection information may be retained that can be used to track the originating site . In practice , this is generally infeasible and rarely carried out . Some administrators on the network will contact local administrators to request a message be tracked and its writer admonished or punished more severely ( such as revoking the account ) , all of this actually happening occasionally but infrequently . See the sections `` known anonymous mail and posting sites '' and `` responsibilities associated with anonymity '' . _____ < 3.5 > What is ` anonymous posting ' ? Anonymous servers have been established as well for anonymous Usenet posting with all the associated caveats above ( monitored traffic , capricious or risky local circumstances , logging ) . Make sure to test the system at least once by e.g . anonymous posting to misc.test ( however some operators do n't recommend this because many sites ` autorespond ' to test messages , possibly causing the anonymous server to allocate anonymous IDs for those machines ) . See the `` responsibilties associated with anonymous posting '' before proceeding . Another direct route involves using NNTP protocols to submit a message directly to a newserver with arbitrary field information . This practice , not uncommon to hackers , is also generally viewed with hostility by most system administrators , and similar consequences can ensue . See the sections `` known anonymous mail and posting sites '' and `` responsibilities associated with anonymity '' . _____ < 3.6 > Why is anonymity ( un ) stable on the internet ? As noted , many factors compromise the anonymity currently available to the general internet community , and these services should be used with great caution . To summarize , the technology is in its infancy and current approaches are unrefined , unreliable , and not completely trustworthy . No standards have been established and troubling situations of loss of anonymity and bugs in the software are prevalent . Here are some encountered and potential bugs : - One anonymous remailer reallocated already allocated anonymous return addresses . - Others passed signature information embedded in messages unaltered . - Address resolution problems resulting in anonymized mail bounced to a remailer are common . - Forgeries to the anonymous server itself are a problem , possibly allowing unauthorized users to potentially glean anon ID - email address mappings in the alias file . This can be remedied with the use of passwords . - Infinite mail loops are possible with chaining remailers . Source code is being distributed , tested , and refined for these systems , but standards are progressing slowly and weakly . The field is not likely to improve considerably without official endorsement and action by network agencies . The whole idea is essentially still in its infancy and viewed with suspicion and distrust by many on the internet , seen as illegitimate or favorable to criminality . The major objection to anonymity over regular internet use is the perceived lack of accountability to system operators , i.e . invulnerability to account restrictions resulting from outside complaints . System adminstrators at some sites have threatened to filter anonymous news postings generated by the prominent servers from their redistribution flows . This may only have the effect of encouraging server operators to create less characteristically detectable headers . Probably the least problematic approach , and the most traditional to Usenet , is for individual users to deal with anonymous mail however they prefer , e.g . ignoring it or filtering it with kill files . _____ < 3.7 > What is the future of anonymity on the internet ? New anonymous protocols effectively serve to significantly increase safeguards of anonymity . For example , the same mechanism that routes email over multiple hosts , thereby threatening its privacy , can also be used to guarantee it . In a scheme called ` chaining ' an anonymous message is passed through multiple anonymous servers before reaching a destination . In this way generally multiple links of the chain have to be ` broken ' for security to be compromised . Re-encryption at each link makes this scenario even more unlikely . Even more significantly the anonymous remailers could be spread over the internet globally so that local weaknesses ( such as corrupt governments or legal wiretapping within a nation ) would be more unlikely to sacrifice overall security by message tracing . However , remailers run by corrupt operators are possible . The future of anonymous services on the internet is , at this time , highly uncertain and fraught with peril . While specific groups seem to benefit significantly from anonymous posting capabilities , many feel that unlimited newsgroup scope for anonymous posting is a disruptive and dangerous idea and detracts from discussions in ` serious ' groups . The introduction of unlimited group anonymity may have fundamental repercussions on Usenet conventions and distribution mechanisms such as moderated and ` alt ' groups have had in the past . For example , as part of new group creation , the charter may specify whether ` anonymous ' posting is ( un ) welcome . Nevertheless , the widespread introduction and use of anonymity may be inevitable . Based on traffic statistics , anonymous services are in huge demand . Pervasive and readily available anonymity could carry significant and unforeseen social consequences . However , if its use is continued to be generally regarded as subversive it may be confined to the underground . The ramifications of widespread introduction of anonymity to Usenet are still largely unknown . It is unclear whether it will provoke signficant amounts of new traffic or , instead of expansion , cause a shift where a greater portion of existing traffic is anonymized . Conceivably the services could play a role in influencing future mainstream social acceptance of Usenet . * * * This is Part 1 of the Privacy & Anonymity FAQ , obtained via anonymous FTP to pit-manager @ mit.edu : /pub/usenet/news.answers/net-privacy/ or newsgroups news.answers , sci.answers , alt.answers every 21 days .

While I ca n't think of any Corvettes with side mounted backup lights , I know that Saab started using them about 15 years ago . My 1975 Saab 99 did n't have them , but a friend 's 1978 Saab 99 certainly did . In addition to the confentional tail-light mounted backup lights , they had another set integrated into the front turn signal assembly . For those of you who do n't remember , Saabs of that vintage had an enormous multicoloured plastic growth , about the size of a _National Geographic_ magazine , sticking out of the front fender , which incorporated amber `` parking lights '' , amber side marker lights/reflectors , white `` cornering lamps '' ( like American luxury cars ) aimed towards the side of the road when you have your turn indicators on , and white `` backup lights '' aimed towards the back of the car when you have selected reverse gear . The glossy brochure showed how these front mounted backup lights were useful for illuminating hazards ( pot holes , kid's toys , etc ) that would be run over by the front of the car if you had the wheels turned while backing up .

The story is this : I bought a car out of state , and I 'm trying to get the safety inspection in Pennsylvania . The problem is that the car has aftermarket tint on all windows except the windshield . The tint is rather weak , and you can clearly see the inside of the car through the tint . The inspection garage said that they wo n't pass it unless I get a waiver from the state police . So I went to the state police - the officer told me that aftermarket tint is illegal , and I can get a waiver only for a pre-84 car or for a medical reason . I asked him to show me the section of the vehicle code that says it 's illegal . He showed it to me and the paraghaph said that you ca n't have tint , if you ca n't see the inside of the car because of the tint . When I told him that you can in fact see the inside very well , he shut the book and said `` It 's just illegal , and in fact we can have someone give you a ticket for it right now . '' Well , wo n't argue with that ... Since the vehicle code says it 's OK as long as you can see through the tint , I 'd like to keep it ( I 'll re-read the vehicle code in the library ) . I 'd also like to get some sort of paper from the police that says it 's OK , so I can get the inspection , and so that I won't get in trouble for the tint later on . I also would n't mind registering a complaint against that officer - he really pissed me off . So does anyone have any experience getting that sort of a paper from the police , especially in Pennsylvania ? Does anyone have any experience registering a complaint against an officer ? I called the station later on today , but they basically said there is no place where I could register a complaint against an officer ... And if I do decide to keep the tint and get a ticket anyway , how much of a chance do I stand to succesfully appeal the ticket in court ? Any comments about it will be welcome ! Michal

Hence , any apparent > similarity in handling characteristics may , or may *not* be analagous > in its underlying physics to that behind motorcycle handling > characteristics . OK , as one last attempt , I 'll take a different tack . We all seem to be in agreement that there are two explanations for why one can use the handlebars to lean a moving motorcycle . The question is , is one of the effect dominant , and which one is it ? The idea would be to design an experiment which would seaprate the two characteristics , and see which effect produces a similar result to the one with which those of us who have bikes are familiar . Let 's look at the one that , so far , has sparked no controversy on its own , gyroscopic precession . To examine this alone , we would have to get rid of the contact patch effect , by not allowing the contact patches to transmit any force . The wheels and steering mechanism would have to remain , and be attached to a vehicle with about the same weight as a bike , through suspension ( so that the wheels transmit forces to the bike the same way ) similar to a bikes . An experiment would be to ride a bike along a dry road to get moving and to get the wheels spinning , then change surfaces to something that wo n't transmit forces through the contact patches , and try a steering manoeuvre to see if the bike leans . It probably would , since some of us know how easy it is to fall down on ice , but we would n't get a good idea of how well or what it feels like because , without the contact patches , we ca n't turn . Maybe there 's a better way . Besides , even ice does n't get rid of the contact patch forces altogether , so we 'd have to find a really frictionless surface . You 'd have to try it again with the wheels locked to really know if it was the rotation that did it . Looking at the contact-patch effect only , however , is fairly simple . Now we have to find a vehicle that gets the about the same magnitude and direction of cantact patch forces as a motorcycle , and transmits them about the same way to the vehicle , but without rotating wheels . How it gets the contact patch forces is irrelevant , we 're just looking for something that has contact patches that can go straight and not sideways , and skis or skates would do fine . I do n't know of any snow-ski or skate bikes , but up here we have the Suzuki Wetbike that is arranged like a motorcycle but has fat water skis where there should be wheels . I think the propellor is in front of the rear ski , or something like that , but we could try it at a coast to get rid of most of its effect . Now I admit that this is second hand info ( although I 'd love to try one of these ) , but the review in the local cycle rag and a guy in a bike shop that sells them both say that this machine handles very much like a motorcycle , in that you countersteer it to turn . So we have contact patches that transmit similar forces to a bike 's , a similar suspension arrangement , and no gyroscopes , but we do have countersteering . Conclusion : you do n't need gyroscopes to countersteer vehicles that have motorcycle-like contact patch arrangements . We still do n't know what real effect the gyroscopes have when they 're there , but from my observations of how handlebar angle , force , etc . relate to steering in general , I 'm willing to bet that they 're not the dominant factor in countersteering . If you do n't like this conclusion , then do n't accept it , but my motorcycle's behaviour is consistent with it . If someone can prove otherwise , go ahead .

I seem to recall Ratelle and Middleton making a pretty good centre - right wing combination , and the Bruins also got Brad Park in the deal ( and they also lost Vadnais and somebody else ) . After the trade , the Bruins were in two finals and one semi-final , all of which , of course , they lost to Montreal ( which should please you to no end ) . I doubt , however , keeping Esposito would have made a difference in those series , as he did not for the Rangers in '79 ( or any of his years in Boston , for that matter ) .

Maybe they 're just UNLUCKY . If a rapist pulls a woman into an alley in Boston , chances are almost certain that she wo n't be counted as one of those self-defenders because our local constabulary didn't consider it important that she be allowed to arm herself . Even though the shotgun she owns at home makes her show up in the `` gun owner '' column . > In either case , this means the 'average > threat level ' in this country is rather low . Ironic words for somebody who lives in Florida . The `` average threat level '' in Florida has been REDUCED by a liberal CCW policy . It 's well known that your local thugs like to target tourists precisely because they are less likely to be carrying than your natives . Come on up to Boston , or NYC , or Washington DC , and see how much diddlysquat the '' average threat level in the country '' means to a resident there . > I think you have weapons on the brain .

Sometimes it just lands your good neighbors on the dance card for the next wave of drive-bys . Someone here once told a story about LA gangs moving into Phoenix . I 've misplaced the original text , but the story started with one resident calling the cops on a gang member . Sure enough , a few nights later , there was a drive-by performed at the resident 's house . Except that this time , unlike in LA , the entire street came out and returned fire , putting an end to the car 's occupants . The gang packed up and left . Of course , in LA , or in a place like Florida after the hurricane , your first problem is to FIND an officer to step up to and tell anything . > In short , the alternative to firepower is gangs ... or at > least a benificent manifestation of that social cooperative . > Replace lead with flesh ... the flesh makes a better > conversationalist too and you can invite it over for a > block party .

Pure emotion , like the abortion issue . Too many people fit that category , that is true . Some of us like to believe that they are uninterested in the facts behind the case for gun ownership because they 've been conditioned to believe that there ARE N'T any . You seem content to underestimate the electorate ; I 'm willing to try to raise their consciousness . > Argue away ... you ca n't win . I think we can . HCI was founded in what , 1980 ? In the mid-80 's , they ran a `` One Million Strong ! '' campaign for two years before reaching this goal . My understanding is that they `` reached '' it by the stratagem of including wide classes of people other than dues-paying members . ( I ca n't speak authoritatively on this -- maybe somebody else has details . ) Then they started running a `` Two Million Strong ! '' campaign for a while -- but they let it slip into unannounced obscurity when it became clear that they simply were never going to reach that level of membership . In 1964 , just after the commencement of the Dodd Hearings -- the starting point of the modern gun-control movement , the NRA had a mere 625,000 members . By 1968 , barely after the first murmurs of future registration , it had about a million . Today , it has over three million members , making it the third largest membership organization in the country ( next to AARP and AAA ) . And its membership is GROWING FASTER than at any previous time . ( Historical figures from Kukla 's `` Gun Control , '' pp . 61 and 420 . ) As you say , many of the people in the middle of this debate are bemused by their T-bones and MTV . That leaves hard-core gun-owners against hard-core gun banners . I know a number of ex-HCI members who have recently become NRA members .

Done . But did it change the fact that during the period of 1914 to 1920 , the Armenian Government ordered , incited , assisted and participated in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people because of race , religion and national origin ? By the way , you still have n't corrected yourself . During World War II Armenians were carried away with the German might and cringing and fawning over the Nazis . In that zeal , the Armenian publication in Germany , Hairenik , carried statements as follows : [ 1 ] '' Sometimes it is difficult to eradicate these poisonous elements ( the Jews ) when they have struck deep root like a chronic disease , and when it becomes necessary for a people ( the Nazis ) to eradicate them in an uncommon method , these attempts are regarded as revolutionary . During the surgical operation , the flow of blood is a natural thing . '' Now for a brief view of the Armenian genocide of the Muslims and Jews - extracts from a letter dated December 11 , 1983 , published in the San Francisco Chronicle , as an answer to a letter that had been published in the same journal under the signature of one B. Amarian . `` ... We have first hand information and evidence of Armenian atrocities against our people ( Jews ) ... Members of our family witnessed the murder of 148 members of our family near Erzurum , Turkey , by Armenian neighbors , bent on destroying anything and anybody remotely Jewish and/or Muslim . Armenians should look to their own history and see the havoc they and their ancestors perpetrated upon their neighbors ... Armenians were in league with Hitler in the last war , on his premise to grant them self government if , in return , the Armenians would help exterminate Jews ... Armenians were also hearty proponents of the anti-Semitic acts in league with the Russian Communists . Mr. Amarian ! I do n't need your bias . '' Signed Elihu Ben Levi , Vacaville , California .

There are no other alternatives . And if we accept one or the other of those two premises , then again there are two alternatives , either creation was random , or was according to some plan . If it was random , I am unable to accept that the complex nature of our world with interrelated interdependent organisms and creatures could exist as they do . Therefore I am left with creation under the control of an intelligence capable of devising such a scheme . I call that intelligence God .

While I agree with most of Jon says ( I deleted those parts , of course ) , I have serious reservations about this advice . Maintaining a ` just friends ' level of relationship is much easier said than done . People usually end up getting hurt . This is especially likely to happen when they start off with feelings of attraction . When people feel attracted those feelings can cloud their judgement . I 've had the experience of going quickly from believing that I should n't date non-Christians to believing that dating this man would be okay to believing that premarital sex is fine when people really love each other . When the relationship ended my beliefs immediately returned to their original state . This is an especially extreme case because I was young and away from home and fellowship . I do n't think it would work exactly this way for most people . However , it 's important not to underestimate the power of feelings of attraction . Jayne Kulikauskas/ jayne @ mmalt.guild.org

It has a double-barreled message : 1 ) The new Jew must learn to do physical labor , i.e . working the land ; 2 ) The land in this country must pass into Jewish hands , i.e . to the same new Jew who has `` learned '' to work it . Both aspects of the two-pronged concept of `` Hebrew labor '' have racist connotations . On the one hand , the diaspora Jew 's lack of training in physical labor is a myth shared by Zionists and antisemites . On the other hand , its meaning in practice has been the displacement of the Arab farmer from the source of his livelihood . The occupation and the cheap Palestinian labor which streamed from the occupied territories to the factories , orchards , and hot-houses of Israel relegated the myth of `` Hebrew labor '' to the history books and nostalgic memories of the Zionist Movement . It has blossomed forth anew , however , as the government 's answer to problems caused by the closure of the territories . Today too this concept has two functions : 1 ) to give a progressive look to the closing of the Palestinian population . Or in the words of Environment Minister Yossi Sarid , `` I have no tears for those who get rich off of cheap labor '' . 2 ) to furnish an answer to the unemployed Israeli who complains of being obliged to work for wages that are lower than the unemployment insurance he receives . The Israeli government is considering plans to import labor from the far- East to replace native people , Palestinians , who work in their own country , thus creating conflicting interests between two ethnical communities and ruling over them .

[ Hint for Sun OS users : use /usr/5bin/echo instead of /bin/echo or Csh 's built-in echo . Otherwise you 'll have to embed literal ESC and BEL characters in the string instead of using convenient octal sequences . ] If you want your titlebar updated continously , say to show your current directory , hostname , or somesuch , then you'll have to see if you can coerce your shell into spitting out the appropriate escape sequences when it prompts for commands .

The Dimona Nuclear Plant XIII . The Negev as a Military Base XIV . The Negev in the Year 2000 Just after the creation of the State of Israel , the phrase `` the Jewish pioneers will make the desert bloom '' was trumpeted throughout the Western world . After the Six Day War in 1967 , David Ben-Gurion declared in a letter to Charles de Gaulle : `` It 's by our pioneering creation that we have transformed a poor and arid land into a fertile land , created built-up areas , towns and villages in abandoned desert areas '' . Contrary to Ben-Gurion 's assertion , it must be affirmed that during the 26 years of the British mandate over Palestine and for centuries previous , a productive human presence was to be found in all parts of the Negev desert - in the very arid hills and valleys of the southern Negev as well as in the more fertile north . These were the Bedouin Arabs . The real desertification of the Negev , mainly in the southern part , occurred after Israel 's dispossession of the Bedouin's cultivated lands and pastures . Nowadays , the majority of the 12,800 square-kilometer Negev , which represents 62 percent of the State of Israel ( pre-1967 borders ) , has been desertified beyond recognition . The main new occupiers of the formerly Bedouin Negev are the Israeli army ; the Nature Reserves Authority , whose chief role is to prevent Bedouin from roaming their former pasture lands ; and vast industrial zones , including nuclear reactors and dumping grounds for chemical , nuclear and other wastes . Israeli Jews in the Negev today cultivate less than half the surface area cultivated by the Bedouin before 1948 , and there is no Jewish pastoral activity . I . Agricultural and pastoral activities of the Negev Bedouin before and after 1948 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- In 1942 , according to British mandatory statistics , the Beersheba sub-district ( which corresponds more or less to Israel 's Negev , or Southern , district ) had 52,000 inhabitants , almost all Bedouin Arabs , who held 11,500 camels , 6,000 cows and oxen , 42,000 sheep and 22,000 goats . The majority of the Bedouin lived a more or less sedentary life in the north , where precipitation ranged between 200 and 350 mm per year . In 1944 they cultivated about 200,000 hectares of the Beersheba district - i.e . 16 percent of its total area and *more than double the area cultivated by the Negev 's Jewish settlers after 40 years of `` making the desert bloom '' * The Bedouin had a very low crop yield - 350 to 400 kilograms of barley per hectare during rainy years - and their farming techniques were primitive , but production was based solely on animal and human labor . It must also be underscored that animal production , although low , was based entirely on pasturing . Production increased considerably during the rainy years and diminished significantly during drought years . All Bedouin pasture animals - goats , camels and sheep - had the ability to gain weight quickly over the relatively rainy winters and to withstand many waterless days during the hot summers . These animals were the result of a centuries-old process of natural selection in harsh local conditions . After the creation of the State of Israel , 80 percent of the Negev Bedouin were expelled to the Sinai or to Southern Jordan . The 10,000 who were allowed to remain were confined to a territory of 40,000 hectares in a region were annual mean precipiation was 150 mm - a quantity low enough to ensure a crop failure two years out of three . The rare water wells in the south and central Negev , spring of life in the desert , were cemented to prevent Bedouin shepherds from roaming . A few Bedouin shepherds were allowed to stay in the central Negev . But after 1982 , when the Sinai was returned to Egypt , these Bedouin were also eliminated . At the same time , strong pressure was applied on the Bedouin to abandon cultivation of their fields in order that the land could be transferred to the army . No reliable statistics exist concerning the amount of land held today by Negev Bedouin . It is a known fact that a large part of the 40,000 hectares they cultivated in the 1950s has been seized by the Israeli authorities . Indeed , most of the Bedouin are now confined to seven `` development towns '' , or *sowetos* , established for them .

It seems likely to me that that a large subset of encrypted communications would be archived to tape so they could be read if sometime in the future probable cause arises and a warrant is obtained . I can even imagine this being found legal and constitutional , since nothing is actually listened to until a valid warrant is issued and the keys are obtained . Imagine archiving all pay-phone conversations , so if someone turns out to be a drug dealer , you can listen to all their past drug deals . And archive calls to/from suspected Mafia members , potential terrorists , radicals , etc . Imagine the convenience for the police of being able to get a warrant now and listening to all the calls the World Trade Center bombers made in the past year . Since archiving would be such a powerful tool and so easy to do , why would n't it happen ? Ken Shirriff shirriff @ sprite.Berkeley.EDU

To the degree that relativism is a more accurate decription of the truth than is objectivism , it provides more power and ability to control events . Assuming , for the moment , that morals _are_ relative , then two relativists can recognize that neither has a lock on the absolute truth and they can proceed to negotiate a workable compromise that produces the desired results . Assuming that there is an absolute morality , two disagreeing objectivists can either be both wrong or just one of them right ; there is no room for compromise . Once you beleive in absolute morals , you must accept that you are amoral or that everyone who disagrees with you is amoral .

If the first , you have to remember that intel CISC ( like the > pentium ) are a always a generation away from the best riscs ... also Riscs > cpu are more costly because they are not sold in the same quantities ( not > even on the same order ) ... but I remember reading about 3 years ( maybe 2 ) > about a T800 ( ? ) from hypercube that did a 100 mips , was superscallar AND > reordered its instruction itself so I 'm not 100 % sure , but I think the T800 was a 25MHz transputer ? so ya tie a gazillion of them together to get 100mips . ( The newest is the T9000 which kicks anyone 's butt : ) ... have n't seen them used much though ) . Anyway , to respond , I think the Pentium ( CISC ) is better than the more advanced RISC ( e.g. , like the alpha , etc . the 66MHz Pentium has approximately the same `` performance '' as the superduper 133MHz Alpha - here , performance is the weird Specint92 that everyone refers to ? - this is what I *heard* - the Alpha still kicks in the P5 's butt in fp - again , this is what I *heard* ) . and in the computing world , if you sell lots of chips ( like intel ) , and make it faster ( like intel ) , you are the winner ( like intel ) , even though you have a sucky architecture from over 10 years ago ( like intel :0 ) . If you can make a `` CISC '' chip ( superscalar , superduperpipelined , superfast ) with the ideas behind the `` RISC '' ideology , you got a CISC chip . And then I admit I ca n't see the advantages of RISC over CISC ... If the latest technology is a generation behind , then it sucks ( relatively speaking ) . Now I may sound like I like intel , but I 'll have to say that the P5 is some real kick butt pile of Si and SiO2 ... But I hope that Motorola really catches up with the 68K line ... or I 'm gon na start crying ... brian -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Brian `` Hojo '' Lee | `` Hey , excuse me miss , could I have a .GIF of you ?

In Manchester , CT a few years ago , a small company wanted to run a game system galled `` LaserGames , '' similar in many aspects to Photon ( tm ) . Three lawyers and about a hundred citizens found an ancient law in Manchester 's books which clearly from context was designed to prohibit travelling carnivals by enumerating the features of a carnival which they felt at the time made the prohibition obvious . Among these things was `` shooting galleries , '' which is what the lawyers for the opposition to LaserGames wanted to harp upon . The judge took the two words from this law , completely out of context , and ruled that LaserGames could not operate in Manchester . Keep in mind that most travelling carnivals use projectile weapons in their shooting galleries , and not light beams . Clearly from context , LaserGames got shafted , but if the two words are applied , their denial of operating permission was justified . If I had the text of the law I 'd post it , but I 'm afraid I don't remember it all well enough to even try .

Some thoughts : Has any work been done on encapsulating encrypted data inside `` non-encrypted '' data files ? Many file formats can be written with `` gaps '' in them to hide other data . New file formats could be designed to have alternate data hidden by dispersing it amongst the `` legitimate '' data . The hidden data would only show up with the right key ( s ) , and a file with hidden data would be indistinguishable from one without . So , only the correct key ( s ) would reveal the presence of an `` illegal '' document . If I devise a custom file compression algorithm and only I and a friend have the uncompressor , and otherwise the file appears to be total gigerish , do I have the right to transmit the file ? Will we have to `` escrow '' all our data file formats ? Are gangs required to escrow their hand signals , colors and catch phrases ? I think that it 's important to evaluate the content of electronic speach by replacing the media with pen and paper or verbal speach and then re-ask the question .

Lines : 82 UPI Washington DC , Update Desk 4/15/93 For the past several months the Clinton administration has been stymied by mixed signals coming from the economy . While most leading indicators has shown an apparent improvement in the economy , there has been no corresponding improvement in the area of jobs creation . The unemployment figures seem stalled at the 7 % mark . last month , in an effort to understand this problem , President Clinton appointed a blue ribbon panel to try to resolve the apparent conflicting economic signals . This panel was chaired by Vice President Gore . Today the panel released their results , providing a shocking conclusion . `` It 's the guns '' Vice President Gore said . Apparently NRA members , and other `` gun-nuts '' are purchasing firearms at in record numbers , pulling the economy out of the recession . `` Their buying them five times faster than ever before , and stockpiling left and right '' , the Vice President said . However , since many domestic firearm and ammunition manufacturers have been experiencing hard times during the past few years , including several declarations of bankruptcy by many leading American gun makers , they have not rushed to increase hiring to meet the new demand . `` We want to see if this run will continue before hiring more people '' , said the President of Colt industries . `` As long as Clinton is in office , we suspect it will '' , he added . In response to this new information , President Clinton announced a new Gun Control measure to be introduced into Congress this session . It 's called the `` Ban-One-A-Month '' Gun Control Bill . Under the terms of this law , every make and model of all firearms will be written on individual index cards . The cards will all be put in a big hat and the President will draw one card every month . Sixty days later that gun will be banned from any further manufacture/importation or sale in this country , except to the politically connected and to members of the National Police Force . The President said , `` This law will benefit America two ways . When the Gun-Of-The-Month is announced every thirty days , the gun-nuts will run out and buy thousands of them , boosting the economy even more . In addition , over the long run , we will get all of these icky-evil guns off of the street . '' He also announce the appointment of Sarah Brady to oversee this program , citing her `` Honesty , and unbiased view on the subject of gun control '' . Senators Metzenbaum , DeConcini , Feinstein , and Boxer have proposed an amendment to the Bill which would add additional index cards containing caliber designations for all know ammunitions . `` Their stockpiling , stockpiling , stockpiling '' screamed Metzenbaum during a press conference at the national Headquarters of Handgun Control Inc . Senators Simon , Metzenbaum , and Moyenhan also introduced an amendment that would make all guns illegal to possess once the last card has been drawn from the hat . Senator Simon was quoted as saying , `` First we'll fuck em , then we 'll kick em out of bed in the morning '' , during a press conference he held in the second floor Mens Restroom of the Senate building . He of course was referring to the fact that he would allow the people to purchase the guns to help the economy , but would require the BATF to seize all of the guns in America sometime in the year 2008 , after all of the cards have been drawn . The head of the BATF responded by saying , `` We will have to see if this thing in Waco is over by then . We may be too busy to seize all those guns '' . US House Representatives Pat Schroeder and David Skaggs of Colorado declared this proposed law as being `` reasonable gun control which won't affect anybodys Constitutional right to own sporting guns '' . - end article - For the humor impaired : - ) : - ) : - ) : - ) : - ) : - ) : - ) : - ) : - ) Bill Vojak vojak @ icebucket.stortek.com NRA , ILA , Colorado Firearms Coalition -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- The CBS Nightly Propaganda With Dan Rather .

Take a second look at `` non-toxic , non-flammable '' : MACE ( sold tothe public ) is supposedly nontoxic . Whatthey do not tell you is that if you get mace directly on the linings of the lungs ( such as a direct snort to the face ) above certain quantities , it reacts similarly to a mustard gas inhalation . I know : my father and grandfather were exposed to poison gas in WWI and WWII ; Dad went through the side effects of any WEAPON , including those '' non-toxic '' aerosols . WHat the label ACTUALLY means is : : usually , it wont kill you it may give you permanent CSS asthsma but that 's better than blowing a hole in your head ... ALL aerosols are flammable IF YOU HAVE ENOUGH OXYGEN AND HIT IT WITH THE RIGHT IGNITER . SOme of the most non-flammable substances known will BOOM or SEARFLAME if you hit it with the right combo . Let 's take one : a trash can fire . Makes black smoke ; already burned right ? Ca n't go boom , right ? Wrong . Suck that smoke ( made up of paper that has carbonized , or burned about 35 % of the fuel in it ) into an air conditioning return , mix with about 5:1 air , and light a match . 200 feet of conduit is about the same , when filled with that smoke mixture , as oh , say 200 pounds TNT THAT is why the fire codes say NO OPEN CEILING TILES IN BUILDINGS . Because 3-5 stories of a building have blown OUT by `` nonflammable _smoke_ '' So : Take a little `` nonflammable aerosol '' Mix with gasoline or kerosene fumes NO electricity , remeber ? A bit of heating on the WACO plains ? Boil water to drink since the water was cut off ? liberally mix and allow to settle for 1-4 hours Fumes vent down into the bus underground , and the Davidians move the children UPSTAIRS to a saferoom ( they had one , armor plated , remember ? ) to BREATH , because kids get sick and die from tear gas . and along comes a tracer , a spark , what have you : everyone burns to death .

However , some states ( such as Illinois ) are not tabluated because they > refuse to comply with this sexist definition ! > -- > The worms crawl in > The worms crawl out > The worms post to the net from your account Insofar as several `` liberal '' jurisdictions are concerned , the essential elements of rape are gender neutral . Nonetheless , I decided to provide a number of references to support my original argument . Black 's Law Dictionary ( every law student/lawyer 's friend ) defines rape as : Unlawful sexual intercourse with a female without her consent . The unlawful knowledge of a woman by a man forcibly and against her will . The Model Penal Code ( the statute proposed by the National Conference of Commissioners of Uniform State Laws or other organization for adoption by state legislatures ) defines rape as : A male who has sexual intercourse with a female not his wife is guilty of rape if he ( a ) compels her to submit by force or by threat of imminent death ... .

In response to Email requests , I have assembled this list of large-integer arithmetic packages of which I have heard . Most of these are C function libraries , available in source form . For your convenience , I have placed copies of some of these on ripem.msu.edu ( 35.8.1.178 ) . They are available for anonymous FTP in the directory `` pub/bignum '' . However , what I have may not be the most current version in all cases . Here they are , in no particular order : mp Multiple Precision package that comes with some Unixes Multiple precision package accessed via -lmp flag on your compiler . Provides + , - , * , / , gcd , exponentiation , sqrt . Comes with SunOS , NeXT Mach , BBN Mach 1000 , and probably a few others . See `` man mp '' . Object code only , of course . PARI Henri Cohen , et al. , Universite Bordeaux I , Paris , FRANCE Multiple precision desk calculator and library routines . Contains optimized assembly code for Motorola 68020 , semi-optimized code for SPARC , and apparently rather slow generic C version . Does both integers and reals . Does vectors and matrices as well as scalars . Contains a number of advanced functions , some of which I've never heard of . ( `` Weber 's function '' ? ) Has a factorization function , primality test , & other related stuff . Plenty of TEX documentation . Public domain , but you ca n't distribute modified versions . Available via anonymous FTP from math.ucla.edu . There seem to be Mac- and NeXT-specific versions there in addition to : Filename : pari-1.35a.tar.Z Arithmetic in Global Fields ( Arith ) Kevin R. Coombes , David R. Grant Package of routines for arbitrary precision integers or polynomials over finite fields . Includes basic + , - , * , / and a few others like gcd . Source code in C. Distributed under the terms of the GNU public license . Includes man pages and TEX documentation . Filename : arith.tar.Z Arbitrary Precision Math Library Lloyd Zusman Los Gatos , CA C package which supports basic + , - , * , / . Provides for radix points ( i.e. , non-integers ) . Not as polished as the others here . Posted to comp.sources.misc in October 1988 . Filename : apml.tar.Z BigNum J. Vuillemin , INRIA , FRANCE , and others . Distributed by Digital Equipment Paris Research Lab ( DECPRL ) A `` portable and efficient arbitrary-precision integer '' package . C code , with generic C `` kernel '' , plus assembly `` kernels '' for MC680x0 , Intel i960 , MIPS , NS32032 , Pyramid , and of course VAX . This is probably one of the better-known packages of this type . Implements + , - , * , / , mod , plus logical operations OR , AND , XOR . Both signed and unsigned arithmetic available . Available via email from librarian @ decprl.dec.com . You will receive 5 shell archives . Give your postal address and you will also receive printed documentation from France . Package includes TEX documentation . Publicly available for non-commercial use . I removed this from my archive when I heard a rumor that PRL does n't like others to distribute it . However , BIGNUM *is* distributed as part of ecpp ( see below ) . Lenstra 's package Arjen Lenstra Bellcore Portable unsigned integer package written entirely in C. Includes + , - , * , / , exponentiation , mod , primality testing , sqrt , random number generator , and a few others . The package was uncommented and undocumented ; I have tried to add enough comments to get by . This is the only of these packages that I have actually used . It works well and is very portable . I have n't done any benchmarks against the others , but the code looks clever & Lenstra is an accomplished number theorist . Unlike the other packages here , this one requires you to allocate storage statically -- only a problem if your numbers are really huge . Arjen has placed the code in the public domain . Filename : lenstra.tar.Z lenstra_3.1 Arjen Lenstra , Bellcore An improved version of Arjen 's package above . This one does signed arithmetic and dynamic allocation ( which can be turned off as an option ) . Has a few new routines , too . `` lenstra_3.1 '' contains minor bugfixes to the previously-available `` lenstra_2 '' and `` lenstra_3 '' . Filename : lenstra_3.1.c bmp ( Brent 's Multiple Precision ? ) R. P. Brent 1981 vintage FORTRAN code to do extended precision floating & fixed point arithmetic . Includes most of the mathematical functions you 'd find in a FORTRAN run-time library . This code is an ACM algorithm , number 524 . To obtain , send a mail message to netlib @ ornl.gov containing the line `` send mp.f from bmp '' or better yet , perhaps just start with `` help '' . SPX Kannan Alagappan & Joseph Tardo , DEC This is a huge prototype public key authentication system based on RSA . I mention it here because those who have heard of SPX have probably correctly guessed that it contains a large integer package and I want to inform you that the large integer package it contains is indeed DEC 's BigNum from France . You can get a beta test copy of SPX from crl.dec.com ( 192.58.206.2 ) . Use it only for testing , as it `` may '' expire on a certain date . ( I do n't know whether this has expired yet . ) amp ( Antti 's Multiple Precision ? ) Antti Louko alo @ kampi.hut.fi Multiple precision integer package in C. Includes + , - , * , / , % , pow , mod , 1/x mod y , random , sqrt , gcd . Available for non-commercial use . The package includes `` share-secret '' , a public key system based on the Diffie-Hellman algorithm .

In the May issue of C't Magazine was an article about upgrading 040 models of apple . They simply change crystals and add a fan . Hammerhead : Centris 610 was able to work with 25 MHz ( cooler prefered ) and for 1000 DM you get an 68040 ( 33MHz ) which works with the appropriate crystal at full speed . ( extra cooling required ) Centris 650 like Quadra 700 with extra cooling 33MHz works on most machines and for real power enthusiasts they used a Quadra 950 at 40 MHz wow !

Many pagans are involved in environmentalism -- this is only natural , since respect for the earth is a fundamental tenet of all pagan denominations . This does n't mean that environmentalism is wrong , any more than supporting peace in the Middle East is wrong because Jews and Muslims also work for it . Nonetheless , paganism is certainly on the rise , and we as Christians should address this and look at what draws people from paganism to Christianity . Like it or not , pagan religions are addressing needs that Christianity should be , and is n't . I believe that paganism has hit upon some major truths that Christianity has forgotten . This does n't mean that paganism is right , but it does mean that we have something to learn from the pagan movement . First , paganism respects the feminine . Christianity has a long history of oppressing women , and many ( if not most ) male Christians are still unable to live in a non-sexist manner . The idea that God is sexless , or that Christ could have been a women and still accomplished his mission , is met with a great deal of resistance . This insistance on a male-dominated theology ( and the male-dominated society that goes with it ) drives away many young women who have had to put up with sexist attitudes in their churches . Second , paganism respects the physical world . This is an idea with great ramifications . One of these is environmentalism -- respect for our surroundings and our world . Another is integration of sexuality . Christianity has a long tradition of calling ALL sexual feeelings sinful and urging people to suppress and deny their sexuality . This is too much -- sex is clearly a part of human experience and attempting to remove it is simply not a feasible option . Christianity has only begun to develop a workable sexual ethic , and paganism is an attractive option . I 'm not advocating that Christian doctrines ( no sex before marriage , etc . ) should be changed -- just that Christians work toward a more moderate ethic of sexuality . Denial of sexuality places as much emphasis on sex as unmoderated sexuality , and neither one does much to bring us closer to God .

You should have tried one of the soc.culture groups in the Middle East or South Asia area ( they are a little more open than the Islam channel ) . I think someone defined atheists as polytheists cuz they say we think the world created itself ( or something like that ) so each particle is a God which created the other Gods .

I think Orthodox practice varies from place to place , from parish to parish and from jurisdiction to jurisdiction . In some parishes here in South Africa the only ones who receive communion are infants ( i.e . children under 7 ) . In our parish it is expected that one will have been to Vespers and confessional prayers the evening before , and that one will have been fasting .

Organization : The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Lines : 30 Distribution : world NNTP-Posting-Host : sirius.cs.unc.edu Well , although this may be an uncommon occurrence ( or not ) I had a `` bad '' experience with TechWorks . This past summer I upgraded ( increased ) the memory in a powerbook and a ci . When I called to place the order for the PB RAM , I was told by the sales person that they would give me a $ 50 rebate if I would return the original RAM ( which was also TechWorks RAM . ) I followed the instructions for returning the old RAM , expecting to see a credit on my VISA within a few weeks . Well , months went by , and no credit . After many calls ( almost none of which were ever returned - arghhh ) I finally found someone who told me `` Why we never received your old chips . '' I then explained I the procedure that I had followed to return them , to which the person replied `` You mean you sent them US Mail ? '' ( which I had , per the original sales person 's instructions . ) I was told that they their loss of US mail shipments is not uncommon ( come on ) and that I should have sent the stuff via FedEx , etc . I reasoned that I had done exactly what I had been told to , but they would not budge , the people I spoke with were absolutely no help . I sent letters , copies of the original receipts , attempted to trace the package through the US mail , made *many* more phone calls to TechWorks , all to no avail ( I would n't give-up because I was so disgusted . ) Sales/support people , supervisors , there was nothing I could do to pursuade them to `` make it right . '' I finally ( in total disgust ) wrote a letter to my credit card company , asking them to investigate the problem . Three weeks later , the credit miraculously appeared on my statement . I have not ( in recent memory ) been so disgusted with the service that I received from a company . In all fairness , they had no way of knowing that was not trying to rip them off , but I went to *such* great lengths to prove to them that this really happened . Oh well , c'est la vie . I will never buy another product from them again . ( There - had to get that off my chest ! )

Sounds like it would have a *huge* drag area , not a lot of mass , and be in a fairly low orbit . 2 ) Just what orbital parameters are we talking about here ? What real impact are we talking about , really ? How many optical astronomers are *really* going to be impacted ? 3 ) Which is more important ; adding a few extra days of 'seeing ' for ( very few ) optical astronomers or getting the data the sensors are supposed to return along with the data for large inflatables ( and the potential there for an inflatable space station ) ? The choice would seem to be one or the other , since the advertising is being used to help fund this thing . 4 ) If your answer to 3 ) above was `` the astronomers '' , then feel free to come up with some other way to fund the ( to my mind ) more important research data that would be gained by this WITHOUT SPENDING ANY MORE OF MY MONEY TO DO IT .

The best fitting sphere will have - center ( a , b , c ) = ( p1/2 , p2/2 , p3/2 ) - radius R = sqrt ( p4 + a.a + b.b + c.c ) . So , at last , will this solve you sphere estination problem , at least for the most situations I think ? . Quick van Rijt , rytg7 @ fel.tno.nl

One not-so-quick question to throw out there for you guys ... For our class project , we need to design and build a power supply to the following specs : Voltatge : adjustable from 1-12V Current : *limited* at 1A Voltage must stay within 2 % of designated value for I from 0-1A AC ripple less than 5 mV ( rms ) Of course , we ca n't just use an adjustable voltage , current-limiting regulator chip ; ^ ) Our problem is with the current limiting ( i.e . we 've found stuff to do the rest of the parts of the circuit ) . What the supply must do , if presented with a load which would draw more than 1A , given the supply voltage , is reduce the voltage so that the current will equal one amp . Thus , if we were to short the thing with the ammeter , we should read one amp . If we measure the current through a 1 ohm resistor at 12V , we should read one amp ( and the output voltage , by necessity , must be 1V . The only basic idea we have seen for the current limiter involves a circuit which will pull current off of the base of the output power transistor , and therefore reduce the output . So , does anybody have any ideas we could work from ? Thanks in advance .

Actually , jon , that is quite true . Christian people have caused '' objective morality '' to look very `` relative . '' After all , that was the point of the original question in this thread , i.e . can we toss out Christianity because it is so obviously inconsistent with its own principles ? If you will bear with me , I will attempt to explain this apparent inconsistency from at least one Christian 's viewpoint : If God exists and is the creator of mankind as the Bible claims , then He has a pretty well-defined concept of what makes people tick physically , emotionally , etc . GOD has an `` objective '' morality for us . That is to say , He has no trouble understanding what is good for ( or detrimental to ) the creature He created . Galatians 2:10 -- For we [ mankind ] are His workmanship , created in Christ Jesus for good works [ a morality ] , which God prepared beforehand [ a well-defined design ] , that we might walk in them . However , contrary to what many people assume ( including the Pharasees of the Bible , ) God 's morality can not be completely codified in a list of rules and regulations . To some extent , every activity of a person 's life creates a new situation to which morality must be applied . There never could be enough volumes to codify God's '' objective '' morality for us . Throughout history , mankind has tried to reduce morality to a list of rules ( objectivity , if you please . ) In the Old Testament , we have both principles and specific rules . By the time of Jesus , most of the principles were obscured by the emphasis men had placed on the rules . Volumes of additional rules had been made to try to codify the application of the principles . We [ mankind ] were n't comfortable with the `` subjectivity '' of principles . For reference see Matthew 5 where Jesus explains the difference between the Law and the principles of the Law . For example , in verses 21-22 : `` You have heard that the ancients were told , 'You shall not commit murder ' ... and 'Whoever commits murder shall be liable to the court . ' But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother shall be liable to the court ... '' The `` objective morality '' of God gets blurred by our inept interpretation of it . We [ Christians ] have made our biggest errors when we have allowed any one person or group of people decide EXACTLY what God intended for us . If we [ Christians ] would stay committed to seeking God 's will instead of trying to prove we already had it all figured out , we might do a better job of allowing others to find God's '' objective morality '' for themselves .

You can find the salient difference in any number of 5th amendment related Supreme Court opinions . The Court limits 5th amendment protections to what they call `` testimonial '' evidence , as opposed to physical evidence . The whole question would hinge on whether a crypto key would be considered `` testimonial '' evidence . I suppose arguments could be made either way , though obviously I would hope it would be considered testimonial . Phil

From : kubovich @ iastate.edu ( Mark W Kubovich ) Subject : Common-mode noise and small signals Keywords : noise common mode Organization : Iowa State University , Ames IA Lines : 20 I have never worked with really small signals before and have a few questions about low level noise . I have noticed that the waveform synthesizer that I am using ( Analogic 2020 ) has some relatively large common mode noise on it . I am using this synthesizer to 'null ' out another transient waveform and am amplifying the difference ( ~200uV ) several hundred times . The 2020 has about 1-3 mVp-p of common mode noise and this tends to make my measurements hard to repeat . ( The noise is not quite in sync with line frequency , and on a spectrum analyzer , the main component is about 64Hz ) . How can I get rid of the noise ? When I look at the spectrum using an HP 3582A ( audio range analyzer ) , the noise goes away the minute I switch to 'isolation ' on the input . I am guessing the anlayzer has a diff amp on the input since it will read accurately down to DC . Also , if I use a differential amplifier ( IA ) to solve the problem , how important is it to use one of these 'shield drivers ' ( an amp connected to the shield in sort of a feedback loop to remove trouble caused by different cable capacitances ) ? If anyone can suggest a good IC IA for use with transient signals with content from 1KHz to about 300KHz , I would appreciate it .

I think it 's safe to say that anything that 's not at 0 degrees Kelvin will have its own `` energy signature '' -- the interesting questions are what kind of energy , and what it signifies . I 'd check places like Edmund Scientific ( are they still in business ? ) -- or I wonder if you can find ex-Soviet Union equipment for sale somewhere in the relcom . * hierarchy . Some expansion on Kirlian photography : From the credulous side : [ Stanway , Andrew , _Alternative Medicine : A Guide To Natural Therapies_ , ISBN 0-14-008561-0 , New York : Viking Penguin , 1986 , p211 , p188 . A not-overly critical but still useful overview of 32 alternative health therapies . ] ... the Russian engineer Semyon Kirlian and his wife Valentina during the 1950s . Using alternating currents of high frequency to 'illuminate' their subjects , they photographed them . They found that if an object was a good conductor ( such as a metal ) the picture showed only its surface , while the pictures of poor conductors showed the inner structure of the object even if it were optically opaque . They found too that these high frequency pictures could distinguish between dead and living objects . Dead ones had a constant outline whilst living ones were subject to changes . The object 's life activity was also visible in highly variable colour patterns . High frequency photography has now been practised for twenty years in the Soviet Union but only a few people in the West have taken it up seriously . Professor Douglas Dean in New York and Professor Philips at Washington University in St Louis have produced Kirlian photographs and others have been produced in Brazil , Austria and Germany . Using Kirlian photography it is possible to show an aura around people's fingers , notably around those of healers who are concentrating on healing someone . Normally , blue and white rays emanate from the fingers but , when a subject becomes angry or excited , the aura turns red and spotty . The Soviets are now using Kirlian photography to diagnose diseases which can not be diagnosed by any other method . They argue that in most illnesses there is a preclinical stage during which the person is n't actually ill but is about to be . They claim to be able to foretell a disease by photographing its preclinical phase . But the most exciting phenomenon illustrated by Kirlian photography is the phantom effect . During high frequency photography of a leaf from which a part had been cut , the photograph gave a complete picture of the leaf with the removed part showing up faintly . This is extremely important because it backs up the experiences of psychics who can 'see' the legs of amputees as if they were still there . The important thing about the Kirlian phantoms though is that the electromagnetic pattern ca n't possibly represent a secondary phenomenon -- or the field would vanish when the piece of leaf or leg vanished . The energy grid contained in a living object must therefore be far more significant than the actual object itself . [ ... ] Kirlian photography has shown how water mentally 'charged ' by a healer has a much richer energy field around it than ordinary water ... From the incredulous side : [ MacRobert , Alan , `` Reality shopping ; a consumer 's guide to new age hokum . `` , _Whole Earth Review_ , Autumn 1986 , vNON4 p4 ( 11 ) . An excellent article providing common-sense guidelines for evaluating paranormal claims , and some of the author 's favorite examples of hokum . ] The crank usually works in isolation from everyone else in his field of study , making grand discoveries in his basement . Many paranormal movements can be traced back to such people -- Kirlian photography , for instance . If you pump high-voltage electricity into anything it will emit glowing sparks , common knowledge to electrical workers and hobbyists for a century . It took a lone basement crank to declare that the sparks represent some sort of spiritual aura . In fact , Kirlian photography was subjected to rigorous testing by physicists John O. Pehek , Harry J. Kyler , and David L. Faust , who reported their findings in the October 15 , 1976 , issue of Science . Their conclusion : The variations observed in Kirlian photographs are due solely to moisture on the surface of the body and not to mysterious `` auras '' or even necessarily to changes in mood or mental state . Nevertheless , television shows , magazines , and books ( many by famous parapsychologists ) continue to promote Kirlian photography as proof of the unknown . -- Peter Kaminski kaminski @ netcom.com

If I understand your problem correctly , you want to have a way to send exposures to your manager widget when your app-specific code draws xlib graphics on the window . It sounds like you might want to send an exposure using XSendEvent and specifying a region . If you know the region you need to send the exposure , generally you have the bounding rectangle of the objects , you can use XCreateRegion to create a region , XUnionRectWithRegion to add the new object polygons to the region , and then either use the region to clip your GC for the redraw or use XRectInRegion to test which of your other objects need to be redrawn . Keeping in mind that the stacking order of overlapping objects affects how they look .

Andrew , How I wish this were true , and how I long for the day in which it will be true . But alas , it is not true of history . The Bible does not have a message -- it has messages . And some of those are messages of repentance and giving , to turn the other cheek , and do unto the least of these . But some of the messages are the complete opposite . Like the isrealites order to wipe out other tribes including women and children down to cattle , and punished severely when they were less than complete about the job . Like jews who are said to have cried out in Matthew , `` His blood be upon our heads and our childrens heads '' A verse quoted in every pogrom from the crusades to the holocaust . Have these been misunderstood ? I think not . They have only been understood too clearly . It is essential that christians grasp firmly the good the bible teaches , the meek carpenter from Nazareth is a potent symbol for how we should be , his teachings we must take to heart , but we can not ignore the other material in the bible which is not to our liking and say those who live by that have misread it . To say that is only to chose a point of interpretation and declare it normative . Such can be done with the same legitmacy by anyone . Instead we must let the text critique the text .

( The one I 'm specifically referrring to is Apocolyptic Beginning , which my roommate downloaded from some ftp site ( sumex ? ) ) All of the symptoms are the same on my rommates 170 ( he ca n't run OOTW because he does n't have color ) . We 're both running system 7.1 Does anyone with Lemmings or the other three games I mentioned above get sound out of both speakers on a Mac II class , Quadra , LC , PowerBook 140 or greater , Centris , SE/30 , etc ... ( stereo ) machine ? I used to have a Mac II , and I sort of rememeber Lemmings playing in stereo on that machine , not just on the left channel . ( I could be mistaken , though . If there were a problem with the Quad 900 's and PB 170 's , I am wondering why the system beeps still play in stereo ? If there is n't a problem with our machines , I wonder why the 4 games above are apparantly written to support only one channel of stereo when they could just use mono sounds so the mono sound would at least come out of both speakers ( like Spectre , etc . do ) ? Quadra 900 's and PowerBook 170 's have the same ROMS ( to my knowledge ) , so maybe this is a ROM problem ?

I am having some interesting problems with my Boca graphics card , which is based on the Cirrus Logic chipset ( I am not sure exactly which one ) . The problem is as follows : If I use any Windows driver at 800x600 except for the 64K-colour driver ( ie 16 colour or 256 colour ) , the image on screen becomes too tall - no amount of resizing on the monitor will make it fit . And if I use Excel with the 64K- colour driver , it hangs as soon as it loads . Anyone out there used this card/experienced anything similar . Please reply by mail , and I will post any solutions here .

Of course I believe in Predestination . It 's a very biblical doctrine as Romans 8.28-30 shows ( among other passages ) . Furthermore , the Church has always taught predestination , from the very beginning . But to say that I believe in Predestination does not mean I do not believe in free will . Men freely choose the course of their life , which is also affected by the grace of God . However , unlike the Calvinists and Jansenists , I hold that grace is resistable , otherwise you end up with the idiocy of denying the universal saving will of God ( 1 Timothy 2.4 ) . For God must give enough grace to all to be saved . But only the elect , who he foreknew , are predestined and receive the grace of final perserverance , which guarantees heaven . This does not mean that those without that grace ca n't be saved , it just means that god foreknew their obstinacy and chose not to give it to them , knowing they would not need it , as they had freely chosen hell . ^^^^^^^^^^^ People who are saved are saved by the grace of God , and not by their own effort , for it was God who disposed them to Himself , and predestined them to become saints . But those who perish in everlasting fire perish because they hardened their heart and chose to perish . Thus , they were deserving of God ; s punishment , as they had rejected their Creator , and sinned against the working of the Holy Spirit . > yes , it is up to God to judge . but he will only mete out that > punishment at the last judgement . Well , I would hold that as God most certainly gives everybody some blessing for what good they have done ( even if it was only a little ) , for those He ca n't bless in the next life , He blesses in this one . And those He will not punish in the next life , will be chastised in this one or in Purgatory for their sins . Every sin incurs some temporal punishment , thus , God will punish it unless satisfaction is made for it ( cf . 2 Samuel 12.13-14 , David 's sin of Adultery and Murder were forgiven , but he was still punished with the death of his child . ) And I need not point out the idea of punishment because of God 's judgement is quite prevelant in the Bible . Sodom and Gommorrah , Moses barred from the Holy Land , the slaughter of the Cannanites , Annias and Saphira , Jerusalem in 70 AD , etc . > if jesus stopped the stoning of an adulterous woman ( perhaps this is not a > good parallel , but i 'm going to go with it anyway ) , why should we not > stop the murder and violation of people who may ( or may not ) be more > innocent ? We should stop the slaughter of the innocent ( cf Proverbs 24.11-12 ) , but does that mean that Christians should support a war in Bosnia with the U.S. or even the U.N. involved ? I do not think so , but I am an isolationist , and disagree with foreign adventures in general . But in the case of Bosnia , I frankly see no excuse for us getting militarily involved , it would not be a `` just war . '' `` Blessed '' after all , `` are the peacemakers '' was what Our Lord said , not the interventionists . Our actions in Bosnia must be for peace , and not for a war which is unrelated to anything to justify it for us . Andy Byler

While your interpretation is a reasonable one , I see no reason to reject the other out of hand . The King Jimmy translation says `` if there is no further mischief .

I know if my wife we expecting and someone cause her to spontaneously abort , we would feel that a life was truly taken , not simply a process halted .

You have to provide not only a colormap but also a border . The default border is CopyFromParent , which is not valid when the window 's depth doesn't match its parent 's . Specify a border-pixmap of the correct depth , or a border-pixel , and the problem should go away . There is another problem : I ca n't find anything to indicate that CopyFromParent makes any sense as the border_width parameter to XCreateWindow . Your Xlib implementation probably defines CopyFromParent as zero , to simplify the conversion to wire format , so you are unwittingly asking for a border width of zero , due to the Xlib implementation not providing stricter type-checking .

I purchased it via some mail order catalog when the 4 year old battery in my Oldsmobile would run down during Summer when I was riding my bike more than driving my car . Knowing I 'd be selling the car in a year or so , I purchased the charger . Believe it or not , the thing worked . The battery held a charge and energetically started the car , many times after 4 or 5 weeks of just sitting . Eventually I had to purchase a new battery anyway because the Winter sun was n't strong enough due to its low angle . I think I paid $ 29 or $ 30 for the charger . There are more powerful , more expensive ones , but I purchased the cheapest one I could find .

The distinction is not trivial . Murder happens to innocent people , not people whose line of work is to kill or be killed . It just so happened that these soldiers , in the line of duty , were killed by the opposition . And resistance is different from terrorism . Certainly the athletes in Munich were victims of terrorists ( though some might call them freedom fighters ) . Their deaths can not be compared to those of soldiers who are killed by resistance fighters . Do n't forget that it was the French Resistance to the Nazi occupying forces which eventually succeeded in driving out the hostile occupiers in WWII .

From : jkatz @ access.digex.com ( Jordan Katz ) Subject : U.S. Space Foundation Speech Organization : Express Access Online Communications , Greenbelt , MD USA Lines : 94 Distribution : usa NNTP-Posting-Host : access.digex.net Speech by Pete Worden Delivered Before the U.S. Space Foundation Conference Colorado Springs , Colorado April 15 , 1993 What a delightful opportunity to cause some trouble . For providing me this forum I would sincerely like to thank the U.S. Space Foundation . My topic today is the Single Stage Rocket Technology rocket or SSRT . By I intend to speak of more . How to lower the cost and make rapid progress . SSRT is to my mind -- and I hope to convince you -- the erupting a new rallying cry for our generation in space -- Faster , Cheaper , and Better . Faster , Cheaper , Better and SSRT represent the passing of a torch from one technical generation to another . It is a new thing to be sure -- but it is also a relearning of old things from past masters . When we rolled out the SSRT baby two weeks ago , so called experts told us it violates the laws of physics -- it made no sense . For example , Dr. Eberhart Rachtin - former president of the Aerospace Corp. , said of SSRT in the L.A. Times that it , '' defies the best principles of launching payloads into space . '' Well Dr. Rachtin -- you 've made us mad ! What are these principles that SSRT defies ? Well I 'll tell you . It violates the principle that you need a giant program office to build space hardware . It violates the '' fact '' that it takes 20 years to build something new . And it violates the truism that you cant do anything significant for less than many billions of dollars . It took some of the last generation 's experts to teach us some new/old lessons . Werhner Von Braun 's first rocket was not a Saturn V. General Schriever 's ICBM 's did n't take ten years to demonstrate . And the X-1 airplane did n't cost $ 1 billion . It took one of the great engineers of the 1950 's to remind us of these truths -- Max Hunter . Max , to remind you , was a senior engineer in the Thor IRBM program , and old faster , better , cheaper success story . Max has been persistent in a vision of a single stage reusable space launch system since the 1960 's . Because he knew it had to be done in affordable steps - Build a little , Test a little . Next he persuaded us to do a technology demonstration . We did n't solicit a bunch of requirements -- they 'd just change every few years anyway . [ not included in the speech -- The ALS/NLS has such ephemeral requirements that it would better known as `` Shape Shifter '' than `` Space Lifter . '' We did n't spend a lot money -- this X-Rocket only cost $ 60 million . When 's the last time we even built a new airplane for that ? And it didn't take a lot of time to build -- McDonnell Douglas completed it in 18 months . Finally , the government program office consisted of one very over-worked Air Force Major -- motivated in part by the threat that he 'd get to ride on it in a strapped-on lawn chair if it ran over cost or schedule . As I described what SSRT is -- and is n't keep in mind its only a first step . There are several more steps -- and steps that can easily fail -- before the U.S. can field an SSTO . But each step should follow the same principles -- a small management team -- a few years technology demonstration -- and a modest budget . Let me show a few details on SSRT and how it might evolve : ( See charts ) I 'm embarrassed when my generation is compared with the last generation -- the giants of the last great space era , the 1950's and 1960 's . They went to the moon - we built a telescope that ca n't see straight . They soft-landed on Mars - the least we could do is soft-land on Earth ! But we do have an answer . We can follow their build a little , test a little philosophy to produce a truly affordable and routine access to space . I know there are nay sayers among you -- those who say SSRT is a stunt . It needs more thermal protection , the engines are wrong , it would be better to land horizontally , etc , etc . I say to you -- we 'll see you at White Sands in June . You bring your view-graphs , and I 'll bring my rocketship . If we do what we say we can do , then you let us do the next step . [ not included in the speech : If we fail -- you still have your program offices , staff summary sheets , requirement analyses , and decade long programs . ] I bet on my generation and Max Hunter 's idea -- Any Takers ?

From : brands @ cwi.nl ( Stefan Brands ) Subject : * REPORT ON PRIVACY-PROTECTING OFF-LINE CASH AVAILABLE * Organization : CWI , Amsterdam Lines : 60 I recently published a new privacy-protecting off-line electronic cash system as a technical report at CWI . Being a PhD-student at David Chaum 's cryptography-group , our group has a long history in research in the field of privacy-protecting cash systems . The report is called CS-R9323.ps.Z , contains 77 pages , and can be retrieved from ftp.cwi.nl ( 192.16.184.180 ) from the directory pub/CWIreports/AA . The postscript-file is suitable for 300dpi laserprinters . ==================================================================== ABSTRACT ( from coverpage ) : We present a new off-line electronic cash system based on a problem , called the representation problem , of which little use has been made in literature thus far . Our system is the first to be based entirely on discrete logarithms . Using the representation problem as a basic concept , some techniques are introduced that enable us to construct protocols for withdrawal and payment that do not use the cut and choose methodology of earlier systems . As a consequence , our cash system is much more efficient in both computation and communication complexity than any such system proposed previously . Another important aspect of our system concerns its provability . Contrary to previously proposed systems , its correctness can be mathematically proven to a very great extent . Specifically , if we make one plausible assumption concerning a single hash-function , the ability to break the system seems to imply that one can break the Diffie-Hellman problem . Our system offers a number of extensions that are hard to achieve in previously known systems . In our opinion the most interesting of these is that the entire cash system ( including all the extensions ) can be incorporated in a setting based on wallets with observers , which has the important advantage that double-spending can be prevented in the first place , rather than detecting the identity of a double-spender after the fact . In particular , it can be incorporated even under the most stringent requirements conceivable about the privacy of the user , which seems to be impossible to do with previously proposed systems . Another benefit of our system is that framing attempts by a bank have negligible probability of success ( independent of computing power ) by a simple mechanism from within the system , which is something that previous solutions lack entirely . Furthermore , the basic cash system can be extended to checks , multi-show cash and divisibility , while retaining its computational efficiency . ==================================================================== Cryptographers are challenged to try to break this system !

You have said something about choices and the scenario gives them . Therefore we have what you define as free will . Imagine the following . I can do good to other beings , but I can not harm them . Easily implemented by making everyone appreciate being the object of good deeds , but do n't make them long for them , so they can not feel the absence of good as evil . But whose case am I arguing ? It is conceivable , so the omnipotent can do it . Or it would not be omnipotent . If you want logically consistent as well , you have to give up the pet idea of an omnipotent first .

Keywords : DES , CBC , CFB , key search Nntp-Posting-Host : anke.imsd.uni-mainz.de Organization : Johannes Gutenberg Universitaet Mainz Lines : 15 The recent discussion in this news group suggests that a key search attack against DES is quite feasible now . But normally DES is applied in CBC or CFB mode where one chooses a random init vector of 8 bytes . Questions : - Makes it sense to handle the init vector as an additional key ? Then we have a 56 + 64 = 120 bit key . - If yes : Is anything known about the security of this key scheme ? Can we break it faster than by exhaustive search through the 120 bit key space ? -- Klaus Pommerening Institut fuer Medizinische Statistik und Dokumentation der Johannes-Gutenberg-Universitaet Obere Zahlbacher Strasse 69 , W-6500 Mainz , Germany

If Brad 's analysis is correct , it may offer an explanation for why the encryption algorithm is being kept secret . This will prevent competitors from coming out with Clipper-compatible phones which lack the government- installed `` back door . '' The strategy Brad describes will only work as long as the only way to get compatible phones is to have ones with the government chips . ( It would be nice , from the point of view of personal privacy , if Brad turns out to be right . As long as people still have the power to provide their own encryption in place of or in addition to the Clipper , privacy is still possible .

Theoretically it 's limited to service personnel , but some studies I 've heard about have suggested that about half the patients there are civilians who not only have connections but are n't `` urgent '' at all . The problem is , in a system where hospitals ' annual budgets are approved by the government , how do you keep political considerations out of medical decisions ? I bet that if you 're an MP or MPP , or good friends with one , you 're put on any hospital 's `` urgent '' care list no matter how minor your problem .

So what happens if the health care systems financially collapse . Bob Rae , the second least popular man in Ontario , warned Ontarians a few years ago that if they did n't stop cross-border shopping in such huge numbers , `` the services they expect from the province just wo n't be there in a few years '' ( Fortunately for them ( and less fortunately for the retailers here in Western New York ) the Canadian dollar went back to a more realistic value ) . He did n't say so , but I knew he meant the OHIP . What would happen if his warning turned out to be the truth ? Would the private insurers take up the slack ? They 'd be under no obligation to . Of course , they could eventually make money again , but if what you say is true , they 'd be loathe to do so ( and out of practice in handling such basic services , too ) . > > > ****************************************************************** > > > > WOULD N'T FREE CARE ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO RUN TO THE DOCTOR FOR EVERY > > ACHE AND PAIN ? > > > > People who get free treatment *do* go to the doctor and hospital about > > a third more often than those who have to pay a share of their medical > > bills . > > > > Still , Canadians -- who pay nothing at the doctor 's -- have a lower > > per-person health bill than we do . > > It is `` free '' in that there are no deductibles nor copayments ( two > things which I advocate to make the Canadian insurance look more like > real health insurance -- which actually it is ) .

Again , I doubt Americans would like giving the insurance companies that much power . I half wonder if the Canadian health insurers did n't go along with the provinces and the federal government years ago because they knew that there was a good chance of the public system going bust in the long run , and then afterwards they could clean up ( Okay , this sort of contradicts what I said higher up . But it 's another possibility ) . They 'd have an added bonus when arguing against government involvement in their industry-as they could then point to its failure instead of just citing theoretical principles .

I bought one for my wife . > *nnnnnnnng* Thank you for playing , I can not agree with this . I believed this and to put it nicely , it was a piece of junk ! I loved this car , I babied it , I pampered it , and after 2 years , it just could n't stay together , I would say that not everyone will have the problems that I had , but know this , it 's not just the car , it is the ability to get the car fixed , which will NOT happen at any chrysler/dodge/take your pick dealer . I do n't care if there are going to reform their dealers/service with the intro of the LH cars , I will believe it when I see it . Case and point , the local dodge dealer . You drive up , just looking , you do n't even get out of your door , when about 10 ( yes 10 ) salesman all eye you like their next meal , and literally pounce on you , and try to get you to make a deal , on everything your eye wanders towards . Service is about 2 times worse than that . I had an alignment problem , but they tried to tell me that the K frame was bent , and about 2000 dollars of work/parts to fix it . Let me tell you the problems I had , and I took care of this car , I put alot of miles on it in the first couple years , but took it to every checkup it needed , and many that should n't have been . 1988 Dodge Shadow ES These were replaced within the 4 years that I owned the car . Engine 4 Alternators Rear Suspension Torsion Bar 2 Water pumps 5 thermostats Hall effect sensor Main computer 4 Batteries These were rebuilt/repaired Radiator Automatic Transmission Power Steering Those are just the things I can remember off the top of my head . For about a year before I sold the car , I said to myself , it 's a good car , I just ca n't find anybody competent enough the fix it . In the end , before I traded it in for a Saturn , the power steering started acting up again . I just stopped putting money into it . I must have put at least $ 5000- $ 7000 worth of repairs over it 's lifetime . I am sorry but Lee Iacocca can bite me . Bullshit , whoever backs em best , is just afraid the stupid things are going to fall apart , and no one will buy them without assurance , why the hell do you think that LH has been nicknamed Last Hope . You can do better , and I know people will disagree with me here , but Japanese , like Honda , or Toyota , or the only american car company that I feel is a quality product , Saturn . I will not touch another chrysler product again , no way . I do n't care how good the LH cars look good , and I will admit they look promising , but not with the support that you get . GM is n't much better , thank god , they do n't control Saturn , like they do their divisions , or it would be just another marketing ploy . Do n't get me wrong , i will be watching my car ( which I do like ) like a hawk for the next 4 years . I am much more hesitant to say it ( or any ) car is really good , until it has proved itself to me . But since someone else pointed out C & D as a source . I will note , because I used to read these magazines , that Car and Driver has never had a good thing to say about most Chrysler products ( Shadow for one ) , always were they moaning about the reguritated K-car , and engine . Whereas Motor Trend always thought they were great cars . No car magazine is really objective . And although there are alot of people who do n't like Consumers Reports , I will use them to reinforce my argument ( I already know about the big stink with the Saturn crash tests , time will tell how good a car they are ) , the shadow/sundance rate much worse than average , in fact none of the chrysler 's rate a better than average , I think the best one is just average . Excluding the diamond star/mitsubishi stuff and the LH 's . You can find bad stuff about the Shadow . Try as I might , when I researched the Saturn , I could not find anything bad about it . There is a great deal of information about this company , just because it is a new american company and it has created quite a stir in the automotive community , for good reason . Much more than the introduction of any new model lines of any established company . I read an article , which had a sub-column , an I think this imprinted on me more than anything else . Some big wig in Toyota said and I quote , `` We are watching them very closely . '' Come on , everybody grow up , the foreign cars , especially the japanese have been kicking our butts , for good reason , the american car companies could not make a good product or support the customer the way they want these days , to set in their ways , which is one of the reasons Saturn was created . They are still struggling because they have n't learned yet . They have the ability , the workers are not inferior , the technology is not out of date , but their attitude is , and they are just finding this out . It 's called competition gentleman/women if you do n't satisfy the demand of the consumer , well your out.. *asbestos suit on* Gaia

Contrary to what others might have thought , I actually did have a SCSI drive once . It was the Seagate 296N and the ST-02 controller . I found that the controller could n't keep up with a 1:1 interleave , so the best I could do with the drive was a 2:1 interleave and a data transfer of about 450 k/sec . I have had that drive/controller coexist with MFM , RLL , and IDE drives because the ST-02 bios will kinda muscle itself in there with no help needed from the computer 's bios . Dos will see many logical drives , much more than 4 ( I 've had up to 10 ) . I 've often wondered how many SCSI drives you could hang off a ST-01/02 .

If it is only used for that purpose , and does not extend to electronic mail or file encryption , then it IS an improvement over the current mass-produced standard civilian technology which , with a few exceptions , is limited to easy-to-break inverters . Note that the big issue for the feds is the continued ability to wiretap . Before we go off the deep end with long discusions about secure crypto for e-mail and files , let 's focus on this . One question that was not asked in the release is whether this proposal is limited to telephony , or if the government intends to expand it . Though I share many of the concerns expressed by some , I find the proposal less threatening than many others , since right now most Americans have no secure telephony , and any jerk with a pair of clip leads and a `` goat '' can eavesdrop . This would also plug up the security hole in cellular and cordless phones . -- -- -- - Reading between the lines , I infer that the system is highly secure without access to the keys . This would meet the needs of U.S. businesses confronted by rich and powerful adversaries , including French and Japanese security services and rich Japanese companies . It allows the NSA to make available some of its better stuff while protecting law enforcement needs . Most legitimate U.S. corporations trust the NSA , and would be delighted to have a high-security system certified by them , even at the price of depositing keys in escrow . I see no difficulty in creating a reliable escrow . Corporations entrust their secrets to attorneys every day of the week , and that system has worked pretty well . From my point of view this is a fair starting point . There are concerns that need to be addressed , including the reliability of the escrows . But in return we get access to high-security crypto . Many have suggested that DES and other systems may be breakable by the NSA and hence others similarly skilled and endowed . There is at least a good possibility ( which should be checked ) that the proposed system is not so breakable . It does n't have to be , nor does it have to have trapdoors , if the government can get the keys pursuant to a legitimate court order . Thus they can protect legitimate communications against economic adversaries , while still being able to eavesdrop on crooks pursuant to a court order . -- -- -- In discussing this , let 's try to avoid the nastiness , personal attacks and noise of some previous threads .

Specifically , it adds audio and video objects to the classes available in InterViews 3.0.1/3.1 , and it does so without changing the source code for the original classes ( though several configuration files for InterViews need to be changed via a patch file ) . Currently , the Xavier audio classes are only supported on SUN workstations with an audio interface , such as the SPARCstation2 . Xavier has been tested in the following environments : SUN : Machine : SPARCserver470 SPARCstation-IPC OS : SUN-OS4.1.1 or later C++ : SUN C++ ver2.1 NEC ( EWS ) : Machine : EWS4800/210,230 OS : EWS-UX/V ( Rel4.0 ) WSOS41 Release5.1 , Release5.2 C++ : C++ Release3.1 It can be obtained via anonymous ftp from interviews.stanford.edu in /pub/contrib/ ( Xavier.large-demo.tar , and Xavier.tar ) We are preparing a mailing-list for information regarding Xavier . If you are interested , please contact xavier @ tsl.cl.nec.co.jp . I will add your e-mail address to our list .

From : bm562 @ cleveland.Freenet.Edu ( Richard L. Trionfo ) Subject : Re : WFAN Organization : Case Western Reserve University , Cleveland , Ohio ( USA ) Lines : 92 NNTP-Posting-Host : hela.ins.cwru.edu I hope that this comes off as a somewhat unbiased assesment of WFAN and WIP ( I go to school in Philadelphia , and I listen to both stations on a consistant basis . ) Now that the fan has Mike Lupica on from 10 to noon , they have a person who can get the big name guests for interviews , and not just of local importance He did have Dave Cheketts and Fred Wilpon on his show , but he had Bob Costas and Magic Johnson on too . Now here are my opinions of the two stations competing talent : Morning show : In my opinion , I think Imus is much better than Bruno , Cataldi , and Morganti , even though I would feel different if Morganti had a better crew of people to work with . To me , WIP tries to copy Imus but make it all sports as a theme . In terms of sports , Imus lacks the blanketing of the airwaves , but he interjects humor and politics into his show . 10 AM to 12 Noon : I think Chuck Cooperstein and Lupica are equal in their abilities to host a radio show , but I think Chuck has the advantage over Lupica in terms of dealing with the caller who is asking about who the local team is going to draft in the sixth round . Lupica and the other hosts on FAN get better interview guests , but I heard the PD of WIP say that they were not interested in interviews with celebrities unless it was a major story . I would consider this even because they are two different styles of host . 12 Noon to 2 PM : At this point , I would have to give a big advantage to Jody McDonald over Len Berman because Lenny has only been on for a couple of weeks . I just think JM has the ability to transcend the `` homer '' mentality of the Philadelphia fan base . This is most evident when the IGGLES ( Philadelphia spelling ) play the Cowboys because JM is a huge Dallas fan . Where else can you have people call up and predict a 93-0 score without the egging of the hosts ( re : WIP morning 'guys ' ) I do agree that JM was great on the FAN weekend overnight and I miss hearing him over the current crop of rotating hosts . I feel that JM is the best sportstalk host on either station by a good margin . If you are in NY and you ca n't get WIP , JM does fill in on the weekends sometimes . 2PM to 4PM : This is the time when JM goes up against Francesa and Russo ( fatso and froot loops ) and I become the most divided in my loyalties . Mike and the dog are very entertaining , but they often go an hour or so without calls or even 10 to 20 minutes without talking about sports . MATD do get great guests and that is the basis for their show , so it is like the 10 to 12 debate . Another plus is the appearances by Mike and Chris on Imus in the Morning , which are often hilarious . 4 PM to 7 PM : MATD go up against Fredericks and Missanelli . I like Mike Missanelli but I just ca n't stomach Steve Fredericks . I know that SF came from Philly originally , but when he was at the FAN , he was a NY homer as much as he is a Philly homer now . I do n't listen to WIP much after 4 PM unless there is a game on that night , but you will see later for the reason . That is why I give the advantage to FAN . 7 PM to Midnight : S & M are on WIP until 8 and then it is the man who makes Eli that calls MATD all the time seem like a novice on charges of racism , G Cobb . This man is so grating on my nerves that if I listen to him for a few minutes I go nuts . ( I know that is biased , but listen to his show ) On FAN , there is usually a game on , Knicks , Rangers , Mets Jets , or St. John 's basketball . If the game is on the west coast , then it is usually Howie Rose . Of course I think dead air would be better than G Cobb on WIP , but WIP does air Sixers and Flyers games during the season . ( If this is the sports station , why did they lose the IGGLES to WYSP ( home of Howard Stern in Phil . ) ) During the summer , it is all talk on WIP . Overall , I would have to give the advantage to WFAN , with the exception of 10 to 12 , and 2 to 4 where it is even , and 12 to 2 where WIP has the advantage .

While that is currently true from their perspective , it is also worthwhile to note that in such cases the populace often does suffer from attempts to control the guerillas .

As I recall , Amal was primarily nationalistically `` Lebanon for the Lebanese '' motivated . I think that the difference between them was also a matter of funding and support . One question does come to mind however , Given that you claim the Hizbollah to be more committed etc ... and that their stated position is : 1 . No peace talks . 2 . No peace talks . . . . . N-1 . No peace talks . N.

Exactly what reasons can you propose that this testimony should be rejected in favour of Begin 's ? > Please , do n't confuse any of you Deir Yassin `` massacre '' stuff > with facts or scholarship .

Organization : Iowa State University , Ames IA Lines : 21 MSG is common in many food we eat , including Chinese ( though some oriental restaurants might put a tad too much in them ) .

This happens to many of my friends and relatives too .

According to Jerry Taylor , Cato 's director of natural resource studies , we are not running out of sources of energy . The world now has almost 10 times the proven oil reserves it had in 1950 and twice the reserves of 1970 . Proven reserves of coal and natural gas have increased just as dramatically . When standards of living , population densities , and industrial structures are controlled for , the United States is no less energy efficient than Japan and more energy efficient than many of the Group of Seven nations . Energy independence provides little protection against domestic oil price shocks because the energy economy is global . Moreover , since the cost of oil represents only about 2 percent of gross national product , even large increases in the price of oil would have little impact on the overall U.S. economy . Market economies are , on average , 2.75 times more energy efficient per $ 1,000 of GNP than are centrally planned economies . Utilities ' subsidized energy-efficiency measurs , known as demand-side management programs , encourage free riders , overuse of competing resource inputs , an competitive inequities . Furthermore , DSM programs do not reduce demand . Taylor concludes that government-mandated energy conservation imposes unnecessary costs on consumers and wastes , not conserves , energy ; that subsidizing energy-conservation technologies will stymie , not advance , gains in energy conservation ; and that central control over the lifeblood of modern society -- energy -- would transfer tremendous power to the state at the expense of the individual . `` Energy Conservation and Efficiency : The Case Against Coercion '' is no . 189 in the Policy Analysis series published by the Cato Institute , an independent public policy research organization in Washington , DC .

To that end , the Institute strives to achieve greater involvement of the intelligent , concerned lay public in questions of policy and the proper role of government . The Institute is named for Cato 's Letters , libertarian pamphlets that were widely read in the American Colonies in the early 18th century and played a major role in laying the philosophical foundation of the American Revolution . Despite the achievement of the nation 's Founders , today virtually no aspect of life is free from government encroachment . A pervasive intolerance for individual rights is shown by government 's arbitrary intrusions into private economic transactions and its disregard for civil liberties . To counter that trend the Cato Institute undertakes an extensive publications program that addresses the complete spectrum of policy issues . Books , monographs , and shorter studies are commissioned to examine the federal budget , Social Security , regulation , military spending , international trade , and myriad other issues . Major policy conferences are held throughout the year , from which papers are published thrice yearly in the Cato Journal . In order to maintain its independence , the Cato Institute accepts no government funding . Contributions are received from foundations , corporations , and individuals , and other revenue is generated from the sale of publications . The Institute is a nonprofit , tax-exempt , educational foundation under Section 501 ( c ) 3 of the Internal Revenue Code . The Cato Institute 224 Second Street S.E . Washington , DC 20003
From : jgealow @ mtl.mit.edu ( Jeffrey C. Gealow ) Subject : Standard Colormaps Organization : MIT Microsystems Technology Laboratories Lines : 49 Distribution : world NNTP-Posting-Host : mtl.mit.edu I 'm working on an X11R5 application and have concerns regarding standard colormaps . The X11R5 documentation says : `` Usually , a window manager creates these colormaps . '' I wonder what window manager the writer had in mind . Neither twm or mwm seem to create standard colormaps . Of course , one can use xstdcmap to create standard colormaps . However , xstdcmap does n't seem to try very hard to avoid conflicts with the default colormap . When I use standard colormaps created by xstdcmap , the rest of my display goes black . So it seems as if use of standard colormaps causes the very problem standard colormaps are intended to avoid . Perhaps if every application used standard colormaps , things would be wonderful . But not many applications seem to use standard colormaps . Finally , the operation of the functions XmuGetColormapAllocation , XmuStandardColormap , and XmuCreateColormap seem inconsistent with the section 14.3 of the X11R5 XLIB documentation . According to the section 14.3 of the X11R5 XLIB documentation ( p. 436 ) : For GrayScale colormaps , only the colormap , red_max , red_mult , and base_pixel members are defined . The other members are ignored . To compute a GrayScale pixel value , use the following expression : ( gray * red_mult + base_pixel ) & 0xFFFFFFFF XmuGetColormapAllocation , defined in mit/lib/Xmu/CmapAlloc.c , is used by XmuLookupStandardColormap , defined in mit/lib/Xmu/LookupCmap.c to select red_max , green_max , and blue_max values for the call to XmuStandardColormap . When the RGB_GRAY_MAP property is specified , XmuGetColormapAllocation sets red_max to 30 % of the total number of cells in the gray scale , sets green_max to 59 % of the total number , and sets blue_max ot 11 % of the total number . Referring to section 14.3 , one would expect XmuGetColormapAllocation to set red_max to the total number of cells in the gray scale . When the RGB_GRAY_MAP property is specified , XmuStandardColormap , defined in mit/lib/Xmu/StdCmap.c , sets red_mult , green_mult , and blue_mult all equal to 1 . Referring to section 14.3 , one would expect green_mult and blue_mult to be ignored . When red_mult , green_mult , and blue_mult all equal 1 , XmuCreateColormap , defined in mit/lib/Xmu/CrCmap.c , constructs a gray map . The sum of red_max , green_max , and blue_max gives the maximum gray value . Referring to section 14.3 , on would expect red_max to give the maximum gray value .

Geez , where have you been , Ryan ? I proposed this theory *months* ago . Let 's take it one step further , even . If , as the surveys show , up to 33 % of all men have *had* a homosexual encounter , then there must be an even *larger* percentage of people who have had homosexual erotic fantasies . But if less than 10 % of the population is gay , what can we say about these people who do n't identify as gay but have demonstrated gay potential . Obviously , a large chunk of these people *chose* ( or , more accurately , were forced to choose by force of religion and social sanction ) to put those feelings aside , to be heterosexual . Obviously , Cramer and Kaldis fall into this category . These people are the ones who are so hung up on `` choice . '' Obviously , since *they chose* , everyone must have , and homosexuals are just flaunting their `` perversion '' by choosing not to go along with what society has dictated . Of course , I 'm that most awful of perverts . I chose , I gleefully admit that I was heterosexual until I met the right man and *chose* to indulge in my homoerotic potential . Take that !

A thirty bit serial number . And , we are told , the unit key U is derived deterministically from this serial number . That means that there are only one billion possible unit keys . To generate the unit key for a serial number N , the 30-bit value N is first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1 . S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1 , producing a 64-bit block R1 : R1 = E [ D [ E [ N1 ; S1 ] ; S2 ] ; S1 ] . Similarly , N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and N3 , and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed : R2 = E [ D [ E [ N2 ; S1 ] ; S2 ] ; S1 ] R3 = E [ D [ E [ N3 ; S1 ] ; S2 ] ; S1 ] . R1 , R2 , and R3 are then concatenated together , giving 192 bits . The first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2 . The rest are discarded . The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2 . U1 and U2 are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow agencies . Hmmm . We must assume that generating the unit key U from the serial number N rather than generating it from a randomly selected U1 and U2 is an intentional way of assuring a `` fail safe '' for the government -- U is completedly determined given S1 , S2 and N. If S1 and S2 do not change they constitute effective `` master keys '' ( along with F ) , the theft of which ( or the possession of which by various authorities ) completely obviates the security of the system . However , more interestingly , we know , for a fact that if S1 and S2 are fixed no matter what the keyspace for U is no more than 2^30 . Why not pick U1 and U2 at random ? Why this interesting restriction of they key space if it NOT to provide an additional back door ? I find it disturbing that at the very best my security is dependant on approximately 30 bytes worth of information that could be written on the back of a napkin . Even if S1 and S2 change periodically , the rationale behind this restriction in the size of the keyspace seems strange if one is assuming that the goal is security -- and makes perfect sense if the goal is an illusion of security . If S1 and S2 do not change , even if they remain secret I wonder if they can somehow be back-derived given enough unit key/serial number pairs . We are assured that this can not happen -- but no one understands how Skipjack works outside of government officials and , soon , foreign intelligence services that gain the information via espionage . Presumably we will eventually have the information as well -- reverse engineering gets more and more advanced every year -- but by the time we know it may be too late . As a sequence of values for U1 , U2 , and U are generated , they are written onto three separate floppy disks . The first disk contains a file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part U1 . The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values . The third disk contains the unit keys U . Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent 2 takes the second disk . The third disk is used to program the chips . After the chips are programmed , all information is discarded from the vault and the agents leave . The laptop may be destroyed for additional assurance that no information is left behind . None of this makes me feel the least bit secure . The silly notion of '' destroying the laptop '' appears to be yet another bizarre distraction . We all know that you ca n't read data from DRAM that has been turned off for more than a few moments . On the other hand , what we do n't know is why there is a need to generate the unit keys from S1 and S2 in the first place other than to weaken the system . We do n't know if the agents in question would resist a million in cash a piece for their information -- its probably worth hundreds of million , so you can make the bribe arbitrarily hard to resist . And to tell you the truth , doing this in a `` vault '' rather than in Joe Random Tempest-shielded Room with a laptop computer seems like melodrama designed to make high-school dropouts from Peoria impressed -- but it does very little for most of the rest of us . The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the room instead of two . The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2 , and the second two ( the escrow agents ) would take the disks back to the escrow agencies . What would this provide ? Lets say the escrow agencies are the ACLU and the NRA and their agents personally take back the disks and are always honest . Who cares ? The NSA must be laughing out loud , because they have the algorithm to regenerate U given N and likely do n't need to steal they keys as they effectively already have them . -- Perry Metzger pmetzger @ shearson.com -- Laissez faire , laissez passer .

Ah , clarification by obfuscation . Actually , the words `` A well regulated Milita , being necessary to the security of a free state '' is a present participle , used as an adjective to modify 'militia ' , which is followed by the main clause of the sentence , the subject being 'the right ' , the verb 'shall ' . It asserts that the right to keep and bear arms is essential for maintaining a milita . The sentence does n't restrict the right , or state or imply possession of the right by anyone or anything other than the people . All it does is make a positive statement regarding a right of the people . The PEOPLE , as in you and me , as in the First , Fourth , Ninth , Tenth , as well as the Second amendment . The existence of this right is assumed - it is not granted by the amendment . There is no stated or implied condition relating the right to bear arms to the necessity of a well-regulated militia to the security of a free state . In other words , the entire sentence says that the right to keep and bear arms is UNCONDITIONAL . > So in effort not to force my views and not `` to destory our Liberties and > Rights , '' I state that nothing I have written , or will write , in > the matter of `` Liberties and Rights '' is the final word .

Anyone who dies for a `` cause '' runs the risk of dying for a lie . As for people being able to tell if he was a liar , well , we 've had grifters and charlatans since the beginning of civilization . If David Copperfield had been the Messiah , I bet he could have found plenty of believers . Jesus was hardly the first to claim to be a faith healer , and he was n't the first to be `` witnessed . '' What sets him apart ? > Niether was he a lunatic . Would more than an entire nation be drawn > to someone who was crazy . Very doubtful , in fact rediculous . For example > anyone who is drawn to David Koresh is obviously a fool , logical people see > this right away . Rubbish . Nations have followed crazies , liars , psychopaths , and megalomaniacs throughout history . Hitler , Tojo , Mussolini , Khomeini , Qadaffi , Stalin , Papa Doc , and Nixon come to mind ... all from this century . Koresh is a non-issue . > Therefore since he was n't a liar or a lunatic , he must have been the > real thing . Take a discrete mathematics or formal logic course .

Just because something is written in the Bible does not mean it is true , and the age of that tome plus the lack of external supporting evidence makes it less credible . So if you do quote from the Bible in the future , try to back up that quote with supporting evidence . Otherwise , you will get flamed mercilessly . > I do n't think most people understand what a Christian is . It > is certainly not what I see a lot in churches .

Am I supposed to take that as a compliment or a put down ? Just wondering . I do this as a service to the entire baseball world on USENET , especially for those in the East Coast who ca n't get final scores for West Coast games in their newspapers or late TV newscasts . This is helpful to fans in other countries who either receive only weekly scores or updates by the week . Also , many have requested for this kind of service previously but it was only available through BBS 's or some pay news services . By the way , mine is free of charge and has no copyright restrictions . > if you want to send updates and scores , set up a private mailing list > and use that . Remember I only post final scores and the updated standings once a day to the rec.sport.baseball newsgroup . Other than that , everything is done through private e-mail . Currently , there are 986 people on my mailing list that branches off into other mailing lists available for many others . And the list grows by an average of 35 people a day . If people on USENET really do n't want to see the postings I do to rec.sport.baseball on a daily basis , please just let me know . If the response is overwhelming against the posts , I wo n't do it anymore . Thanks for your time .

Organization : USGS Center for Spatial Analysis Technologies Lines : 19 NNTP-Posting-Host : mir.gatech.edu Keywords : HRF Our shop uses a package called CADCore - very good - to scan and subsequently vectorize original maps into digital maps . The problem is that once the raster file is loaded into the CADCore package , a header is added to the .HRF file which makes it unreadable by the supplied converter . We would like to be able to ship some of the already-altered raster images for further use on our workstations . So , here are my questions : ( 1 ) What is the Hitachi format ? - I need this format so I can recognize precisely what to strip out . I strongly suspect that it 's a compressed format - if so , then t might not be possible for me to strip out the offending header . ( 2 ) Are there any UNIX packages that read and recognize HRF ?

CA Keywords : Barbarism Nntp-Posting-Host : cad8.gfx.engga.uwo.ca Lines : 11 It is very encouraging that a number of people took so interest in my posting.I recieved a couple of letters too , some has debated the statement that events in Bosnia are unprecedented in the history of the modern world.Those who contest this statement present the figures of the World War II.However we must keep in mind that it was a World War and no country had the POWER to stop it , today is the matter not of the POWER but of the WILL.It seems to be that what we lack is the will . Second point of difference ( which makes it different from the holocast ( sp ? ) ) is that at that time international community didnot have enough muscle to prevent the unfortunate event , today inspite of all the might , the international community is not just standing neutral but has placed an arms embargo which is to the obvious disadvantage of the weeker side and therefore to the advantage of the bully.Hence indirecltly and possibly unintentionally , mankind has sided with the killers.And this , I think is unprecedented in the history of the modern world .

From : weinss @ rs6101.ecs.rpi.edu ( Stephen Andrew Weinstein ) Subject : New Religion Forming -- Sign Up Summary : Read it . Worthwhile . Laughs & serious questions about real religion . Keywords : Eveism , religion , Nntp-Posting-Host : rs6101.ecs.rpi.edu Organization : Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute , Troy NY Lines : 102 Let me begin by saying I think this is the world 's first religion to use the net as its major recruitment medium . Therefore , even if this religion does not take off , its founding members will be very important historically as this method of soliciting membership will eventually become common . The basis of this religion is to apply various aspects of current conventional morality to the characters in Genesis and Exodus but assume that the Bible's accounts of the facts and historical events is correct . For example , Story of Adam and Eve : Adam and Eve are in Garden of Eden naked and ignorant . Have unlimited supply of food provided , but no clothing , jobs , or knowledge . God says not to eat fruit of tree of knowledge . They do anyway , then try to hide in bushes . God finds them and forces them out of Garden . ( There are several different stories on what they were doing while naked in the bushes that might have angered God . ) Traditional Philosophy : 1 . The only reason you need knowledge or a job is to eat . If someone else will provide you with food , then you can be stupid and unemployed and it 's OK . This is why married women usually did n't work until recent decades . 2 . Authority figures , such as God , whoever was behind the Vietnam War , Hitler and slaveowners , are always right and should be blindly followed without question by ordinary people , who ca n't make decisions for themselves . Interpretation of events based on Traditional Philosophy : They were not supposed to eat the fruit . They should have done whatever God told them to . Like small children , they had their needs provided for and were obligated to do whatever their `` Father '' said to . Being forced to leave the Garden and work in order to obtain food was a punishment . Lessons from Traditional Interpretation : 1 . Ignorance is good . Knowledge is bad , but tempting . 2 . Having food provided for you for nothing ( read `` welfare '' ) is ideal . Get- ting a job and feeding yourself with what you earn is punishment . 3 . Public nudity is good . Covering up is bad . 4 . Authority figures are intrinsically right . Normal people are dumb and should do whatever they are told without question . They should not think for themselves . 5 . People in subordinate positions are especially obligated to refrain from learning . For example , it should be illegal for slaves to learn to read . 1990 's philosophy : 1 . People should seek education and employment outside the home , unless named `` Hillary Clinton '' or `` Murphy Brown '' . 2 . People should use common sense . They should not kill other people ( binding of Issac , wars , Holocaust , etc . ) just because they are told to . Interpretation of events based on current philosophy : They were supposed to eat the fruit . God gave wanted them to seek knowledge rather than be handed it on a silver platter . Once they had gained knowledge and ( by seeking it ) showed their ability to make mature decisions for them- selves , they no longer needed to be treated like little children and were REWARDED by being allowed into the `` real world . '' Lessons from new interpretation : 1 . Ignorance is bad . Knowledge is good , but must be sought . 2 . Having food provided for you for nothing ( read `` welfare '' ) is at best a temporary measure . Getting a job and feeding yourself with what you earn is ideal . 3 . Public nudity is bad . Covering up is good . 4 . Authority figures are often wrong . Normal people are intelligent and should consider whether the instructions are really a good idea and `` alter or abolish '' bad governments . They should think for themselves . 5 . People in subordinate decisions are often discouraged from knowledge but should seek it anyway , and all the harder . For example , poor children without good schools should work especially hard in order to make a better life for their children ( and themselves ) . I have tentatively named this new philosophy `` The Church of Eveism '' because Eve 's decision to eat the apple is man [ sic ] kind 's first good decision , instead of its first bad one , as traditionally believed . She is therefore clearly a protagonist . God at first appears evil , for telling people not to seek knowledge but on deeper analysis is also a protagonist . As God rewarded the decision to defy him , and provided the tree in the first place , the intention and desire were clearly to have the knowledge be obtained , but to delay it until it was actively sought . -- -End serious discussion .

I 'd guess that the better team you face in the opening game , the better it is , since the chances of an upset are greater then . Some other reasons why the `` worse '' teams are so tough to beat was presented by Hans `` Virus '' Lindberg ( former coach in Switzerland ) . 1 ) The `` worse '' teams ( referring to France , Switzerland , Austria , Italy etc ) have now usually world class goalies . 2 ) Their defensive play have become much more disciplined , they take much less unnecessary penalties . 3 ) They use four lines which makes it harder to make them `` run out of gas .

Now that Clinton is using that > same list in order to garner support for the bill , are you guys going to > do the honorable thing and say that Clinton is being dishonest . As one of the `` Clintonites '' cited above , I 'll try to clarify since this is not a case of Clinton 's `` dishonesty . '' ( I wo n't necessarily defend him on other issues . ) There were NEVER any specific projects included in the Community Development Block Grant portion of the President 's proposal . Congressional Republicans , in an effort to discredit the stimulus package , selected what they felt were silly sounding projects from a wish-list of POTENTIAL projects prepared by the US Mayors ' Conference before the stimulus package was ever proposed . ( The document in question was designed to pressure the White House to increase the size of the block grant proposal submitted to Congress . It did n't work . ) The $ 2.56 ( ? ) billion proposed in the stimulus package came nowhere close to covering the total estimated cost of the original wish-list . If it were passed , communities would have to select which projects to fund and at what level . In the case of Spokane , Wa. , Tom Foley 's home district , no one ever expected to be able to refurbish a local swimming pool ( one of the Republicans ' examples ) FROM THE FUNDS AVAILABLE IN THE STIMULUS PACKAGE since the estimated cost of doing so exceeded the total amount of block grant funds the city would receive from the stimulus package for ALL projects . The plan , instead , was to use the money on public housing construction and remodeling to cope with a severe housing shortage . ( Yup , there are places where that is true . ) The swimming pool improvements were near the bottom of a long list of priorities prepared by the city . The $ 3 million or so to be received would cover only a few of the most pressing priorities . If the block grants are cut from the stimulus package , it is these projects that will be affected by the lack of funds . And that is why the Clinton administration has been publicizing the issue . A final point . One may or may not like community block grants . It is worth noting , however , that Congressional Republicans ' opposition to them is new . Since the Nixon administration , Republicans have generally supported such grants as an alternative to targeted federal spending , arguing that local governments are far better able to determine spending priorities than `` Washington bureaucrats .

The answer to both questions is yes . All Scripture is true , being inspired by God . The evidence for this claim has been discussed ad nauseum in this group . Similarly , all truth is absolute . Indeed , a non-absolute truth is a contradiction in terms . When is something absolute ? When it is always true . Obviously , if a `` truth '' is not always `` true '' then we have a contradiction in terms . Many people claim that there are no absolutes in the world . Such a statement is terribly self-contradictory . Let me put it to you this way . If there are no absolutes , should n't we conclude that the statement , '' There are no absolutes '' is not absolutely true ? Obviously , we have a contradiction here . This is just one of the reasons why Christians defy the world by claiming that there are indeed absolutes in the universe . > There is hardly consensus , even in evangelical > Christianity ( not to mention the rest of Christianity ) regarding > Biblical interpretation . So ? People sometimes disagree about what is true . This does not negate the fact , however , that there are still absolutes in the universe . Moreover , evangelical Christianity , at least , still professes to believe in certain truths . Man is sinful , man needs salvation , and Jesus is the propitiation for mankind 's sins , to name a few . Any group that does not profess to believe these statements can not be accurately called evangelical . -- Virgilio `` Dean '' Velasco Jr , Department of Electrical Eng ' g and Applied Physics CWRU graduate student , roboticist-in-training and Q wannabee `` Bullwinkle , that man 's intimidating a referee !

From : smb @ research.att.com ( Steven Bellovin ) Subject : Clipper -- some new thoughts Organization : AT & T Bell Laboratories Lines : 55 I 'd *desparately* prefer it if we did n't rehash the same arguments that went on ad infinitum last time . That 's especially true for sci.crypt . For that matter , I 've created alt.privacy.clipper , since the traffic is appearing in *many* different groups right now . I 'm going to focus here on some technical aspects of the plan , hence my followup to sci.crypt . Frankly , if you 're not an absolutist , your feelings may turn on some of these issues . For example -- with an 80-bit key , simply splitting it into two 40-bit pieces is much less acceptable than other schemes , because it means that if just one repository is , shall we say , overly pliable , a would-be eavesdropper would need to recover just 40 more bits of key . I need not point out in this newsgroup that that 's pretty easy to do by exhaustive search . A slightly more complex scheme -- XOR-ing the key with a random number , and then with its complement -- would produce two 80-bit subkeys , neither of which is useful alone . That variant is much more resistant to attack . Clearly , one can get even more sophisticated , to protect the subkeys even more . Other thoughts ... Some people have noted the size and complexity of the databases necessary . But the id strings the phones emit could be their back door key , double-encrypted with the escrow repositories' public keys . For that matter , they could do that only with session keys , and have no back door at all . In that case , the FBI would have to bring every intercept to the repositories to be decrypted . This would answer many of the objections along the lines of `` how do you make sure they stop '' . We can even combine that with a variant of the digital telephony back door -- have the switch do the tap , but with a digitally-signed record of the time , phone number , etc , of the call . That provides proof to the escrow agents that the tap was done in compliance with the terms of the warrant . I can suggest other variations , too . Suppose each Clipper chip had 100 public key pairs . Each would be used ~10 times , after which you 'd need more keying material . ( Not a bad idea in any event . ) This could be used to enforce time limits , or rather , usage limits , on each warrant ; the keys the repository agents would deliver would n't last for very long . I suspect that the cryptographic algorithm itself is secure . Apart from the obvious -- why push a weak algorithm when you 've already got the back door ? -- I think that the government is still genuinely concerned about foreign espionage , especially aimed at commercial targets . This scheme lets the spooks have their cake and eat it , too . ( I 've heard rumors , over the years , that some factions within NSA were unhappy with DES because it was too good . Not that they could n't crack it , but it was much too expensive to do so as easily as they 'd want . ) They 're keeping the details secret so that others do n't build their own implementations without the back door . The cryptographic protocol , though , is another matter . I see no valid reasons for keeping it secret , and -- as I hope I 've shown above -- there are a lot of ways to do things that are n't ( quite ) as bad .

I think this is mostly the fault of the people who write up the literature and price lists being confused themselves . Since there are two possible processor configurations and one of the them does n't have an FPU it does seem to be an option , even though it really is n't . > > I 'm planning to buy the C650 8/230/cd pretty soon , but I 'm now getting > > confused with whether it comes with fpu or not . Well , then allow me to end your confusion . The C650 ONLY come with an LC040 in the base 4/80 configuration . If you are not getting this configuration then you are getting an FPU . > > Why say `` optional '' if it 's built in ? Good question .

My > understanding is that the `` optional fpu '' refers to your option of purchasing > the Centris 650 4/80 without FPU OR one of the other configurations WITH FPU . This is possible , but an option is something that you are supposed to be able to request when you want it . What Apple has done is given the buyer a CHOICE between configurations and not an OPTION . > Apple does not offer an upgrade from the non-FPU system to become an FPU > system . And , it is unclear whether the '040 processor on the non-FPU system > ( a 68LC040 ) can be replaced with a 68RC040 supplied by another vendor . This is not unclear at all . In fact Apple has included in the ROMs of those machines with LC040s code to recognize the presence of the full 040 's FPU and use it . Thereby making the upgrade as easy as switching chips . You pop the LC040 out and pop in a full '040 . > Apple did send a memo out at one point sating that the Centris 610 , which ONLY > comes with a non-FPU 68LC040 processor CAN NOT be upgraded to support an FPU - > the pin configurations of the two chips apparently do not match so you can not > swap one for another ( again , according to Apple 's memo ) . They did ? I think I would double-check this . It has been stated countless times in this newsgroup by two of the Centris hardware designers that the LC040 and the full '040 are pin compatible and that the C610 can be upgraded to a full '040 . -Hades
From : dcb @ wdl1.wdl.loral.com ( David C Blume ) Subject : Can not move data fast enough ! ? Summary : disk - > buffer - > network card Keywords : NuBus , SCSI , disk , throughput Organization : Gokuraku Videos Lines : 43 I want to achieve an overall throughput rate of around 5 megabytes / sec for very large data transfers . ( Around 5 MB . ) I have a Quadra 950 . I have a NuBus network card that can pump data in to mac memory at 8.5 MB/s . ( using block-mode transfers ) I have a high-speed disk array ( no asynchronous PB calls ) that can achieve 6.8 MB/s . Let 's say all transfers go from disk to buffer to network card . It is not enough to first transfer all the data from the disk to buffer , then transfer all the data from the buffer to card . ( 6.8 MB/s then 8.5 MB/s result in an overall 3.8 MB/s . Too slow ! ) So I tried the following scheme : For an n-megabyte transfer , Step 1 : Load the 1st MB from disk to buffer . Step 2 : Asynch send 1st MB out card , Load the 2nd MB from disk to buffer . Step 3 : Asynch send 2nd MB out card , Load the 3rd MB from disk to buffer . ... Step n : Asynch send the n-1 MB out card , Load the nth MB from disk to buffer . Step n+1 : Send the nth MB out card . Even though the code apparently does execute the card transfer asynchronously , and the card does not use the Mac cpu at all , ( It is using the buffer , tho ' ) each of the steps 2 through n take as long as if the two transfers were executed one after another . So there is no improvement in the rate . Why ? Is the mac RAM dual-port ? ( So the NuBus card and the disk driver can both access data at the same time . ) Is the problem that the two devices , card and disk driver , both have to use the same bus to mac RAM ? Is there anything I can do ? -- David + -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -+ | David Blume | `` I get tired thinking of all the things I | | dcb @ wdl1.wdl.loral.com | do n't want to do .

I used to think this way , and not just about X . For example , incorrect English constructs such as `` its raining '' or `` it 's window id '' annoy me . However , there comes a time when popular usage starts to dictate the way things really are in the world . Indeed , the fact that X won out over NeWS was really down to popular opinion ( I know , we all think it 's ( ! ) technically superior as well ! ) . On a related topic , who is to say that `` color '' is more or less correct than `` colour '' - being Irish , and hence using English English as opposed to American English , I always use the latter except , of course , for API terms such as `` XAllocColor '' and `` colormap '' . In a world that uses the term `` Windows '' to refer to Microsoft Windows , perhaps the time has come to accept `` X Windows '' as a valid term for X. I think that this is a more concise and uncluttered term than , say , '' the X Window System '' and , let 's face it , almost everyone uses it . Ultimately , we all need product sales to more than just X-literate people . In this respect , product recognition is important and a short , snappy , descriptive title ( `` X '' is positively obscure ) will help when dealing with the average punter ( it 's sad - I thought I was a software engineer ! ) . Indeed it is unfortunate that X did not become popularly known as Windows and let MS worry about whether it should be called `` Microsoft Windows '' or `` the Microsoft Window System '' or how about just plain `` Microsoft '' ! To summarise ( or should that be `` summarize '' ) the point of this message : I think there are far more pressing issues facing the X community than worrying about subtle distinctions in the naming of the window system ( or should that be `` windowing system '' ) . Whatever gets recognised is fine by me . I agree that one should be careful in interpreting what trade papers say . However , I would be reluctant to come to this conclusion purely on the basis of how they name the X Window System . Gerard O'Driscoll ( gerard.odriscoll @ dps.co.uk ) Du Pont Pixel Systems Ltd .

If we use original intent as the basis for intrepreting the constitution , it is clear that the founding fathers intended that the individual citizen be allowed to bear arms similar to those used by soldiers of the day . For references , I cite : - Federalist papers - `` The Embarassing Second Ammendment '' , Yale Law Review , Prof. Stanford Levinson [ sorry , I do n't have the date handy ] Prof Levinson sought to prove that the 2nd ammendment did not convey an individual right , but concluded that it did , hence the `` embarassing '' in his title . - Report of the Subcomittee on the Consititution , United States Sendate , 97th Congress , Second Session February 1982 . - U.S. vs. Verguido Urguidez ( Supreme court case in recent years ) . Although this case did not pertain to firearms , Justice Rhenquist notes that the term `` the people '' is a term of art conveying individual rights , and specifically cited several used , 2nd ammentment included , in his opinion . - Title 10 , U.S. Code . This states that all males between the ages of 18 & 45 not part of the organized militia , and all female officers of the national guard are part of the unorganized militia . Feel free to cite any scholarly and historical references you have to support your position . I could go on a greater length with my personal proof by assertion , however , such a technique would carry no more or less weight that your dubious proofs by assertion .

I may be wrong , but a loaded Tarus beats a Saturn SL2 . I agree that a fully-loaded SL2 would come close in price to a LOWER-END Ford Taurus . A FULLY-LOADED Taurus , on the other hand , would still be substantially more expensive than even the most glitzy SL2 . A fully loaded SL2 would run somewhere around $ 17,000 , while a fully loaded Taurus LX would be somewhere around the $ 22,000- $ 23,000 range . A base Taurus ( GL I believe ) might start around $ 15,000 . Of course there is the Taurus SHO which can push $ 30,000 if you really try , but this is a totally different car than your mainstream Taurus sedan . Your statement was not entirely faulty , just a little inaccurate . > > I ca n't see Saturn is of better value and that is why I was puzzled > by its pricings .

Source : Edward K. Boghosian , `` Radical Group Hosts Well-Attended Solidarity Meeting , '' The Armenian Reporter , May 1 , 1986 , pp . 1 & 18 . ATHENS , Greece - An array of representatives of Greek political parties , including the ruling PASOK party , and a host of political groups , both Armenian and non-Armenian , joined to voice their solidarity with the Armenian people in their pursuit of their cause and activities of a new Armenian political force were voiced here on Sunday , April 20 during the 2nd International Meeting of Solidarity with the Armenian People . And judging from encouraging messages offered by the representatives of these political groups and organizations , at least here in Greece , the Armenian Cause enjoys abundant support from a wide spectrum of the political world . The International Meeting of Solidarity was sponsored by the Greek branch of the Armenian Popular Movement , a comparatively new political force headed by younger generations of Armenians , who openly profess their support of the armed struggle and of the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia ( ASALA ) . The organization has branches in various European and Middle Eastern countries and the United States although some of these branches appear to have gone through a switch of loyalties because of the split within the ranks of ASALA ... Voicing the support of PASOK , the ruling party in Greece , to the Armenian people , was Mr. Charalambidi Michalis , a member of the Central Committee of the party and the Greek member of the Permanent People 's Tribunal ... Explaining the goals and aspirations of the Armenian Popular Movement was Ara Sarkisian . Significant was the address delivered by Mr. Bassam Abu-Salim , on behalf of the Popular Front for the movement 's continued support of the Armenians ' armed struggle in their pursuit of their cause , pledging that Palestinian operated and run training camps would always be open to Armenian youth who need training for such a struggle . Later , Mr. Abu-Salim , answering a question put to him by this writer , affirmed that his organization had always trained Armenian members of ASALA and that this policy will continue . `` The doors of our camps are always open to Armenian freedom fighters , '' he affirmed . Among the prominent Greek politicians who attended the conference was the son of Prime Minister Papandreou , who himself holds a post in the Greek cabinet ; two members of the Cypriot Parliament who had journeyed to Athens for the specific purpose of attending the international gathering ; representatives of the Christian Democratic party , EDIK Center party , two wings of the Communist party , representatives of an assortment of labor unions and trade associations , a number of mayors of Greek towns and cities ; two Greek members of the European Parliament and other members of the Greek Parliament were also among those who participated in the international conference . Also on hand to follow the deliberations was the ambassador of Bulgaria in Athens . More than significant was the large number of messages received by the organizers , including the following : Palestinian National Revolutionary Movement , Fatah ; Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command ; the Central Committee of the Palestinian National Liberation Movement-Fatah ; the Socialist Progressive Party of Lebanon ; Arab Socialist Labor Party ; the Kurdistan Democratic Union of Iraq ; and numerous other international groups , all noted for their radical stand in the Israeli- Palestinian conflict . SUPPORT FROM ARF-RM Among messages received from Armenian groups was the Armenian Revolutionary Federation-Revolutionary Movement , the group that has claimed the abduction and assassination of key party leaders in Lebanon accused of selling out to foreign interests and powers . The message clearly gave its support to the Armenian Popular Movement pledging that the Revolutionary movement will continue to `` reveal the realities , no matter how bitter or tragic they are , '' to expose the anti-Armenian activities of the leaders of the Dashnag `` Bureau . '' The message was taken as an indication of the link , loose as it may be , that exists between the dissident Dashnag group and the Armenian Popular Movement , open supporters of ASALA and armed struggle . The Armenian Popular Movement has set up its headquarters in a suburb of the Greek capital , known as Neos Kosmos , where there is a large Armenian presence . The headquarters are located in a two-story building , which appears to have turned into a beehive of activity on the part of scores of Armenian youth , who prefer to give their first names only when invited to introduce themselves ...

The issue was not the number of pages the book has..or the year first published.. And you tried to hide the whole point.. the point is that both books have the exactly the same quotes about how moslems are killed , tortured , etc by Armenians..and those quotes given by Serdar Argic exist ! ! It was the issue , wasn't-it ? you were not able to object it ... Does it bother you anyway ? You name all these tortures and murders ( by Armenians ) as a `` crap '' .. People who think like you are among the main reasons why the World still has so many `` craps '' in the 1993 . Any question ?

For a first-time encounter , my *personal* preference would be to deal with a textbook written in my native language . But if you know German and are in Germany , pick up all the reference books you think you can handle . ( I only know these works by reputation , since my German is most rusty , but I 'd look at the following books : Koehler 's lexicon , Mandeldern 's concordance , the Jenni & Westermann theological dictionary of the OT . ) > What 's it like at divinity schools or seminaries in the States ? Is > there a lot of language instruction done ? I really do n't have a basis > for comparison . The amount of language instruction available at US seminaries varies widely , mostly depending on the denominational heritage of the school . Presbyterian and Reformed seminaries probably place a lot more emphasis on the biblical languages than others . ( Of course , any divinity school that has a doctoral program in biblical studies is going to have extensive language resources ! But there are quite a few masters-degree-granting seminaries here at which the attitude seems to be more , `` Well , if you 're *really* interested we 'll give you a semester-long course , but we do n't understand why . . . '' ) The pattern here at the Louisville Presbyterian Seminary is for first-year students to take intensive five-week introductory language courses in each language , followed by semester-long exegesis courses . ( That is : Hebrew in August , OT exegesis in the fall ; Greek in January , NT exegesis in the spring . ) These courses are required for graduation , a third or a half of the students , I 'd say , take advanced biblical work that requires language work .

From : buzz @ bear.com ( Buzz Moschetti ) Subject : Monthly Question about XCopyArea ( ) and Expose Events Reply-To : buzz @ bear.com ( Buzz Moschetti ) Organization : Bear , Stearns & Co. - FAST Lines : 18 ( 2nd posting of the question that just does n't seem to get answered ) Suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped Window that contains Xlib graphics . A button widget , when pressed , will cause a new item to be drawn in the Window . This action clearly should not call XCopyArea ( ) ( or equiv ) directly ; instead , it should register the existence of the new item in a memory structure and let the same expose event handler that handles '' regular '' expose events ( e.g . window manager-driven exposures ) take care of rendering the new image . Using an expose event handler is a `` proper '' way to do this because at the time the handler is called , the Xlib Window is guaranteed to be mapped . The problem , of course , is that no expose event is generated if the window is already visible and mapped . What we need to do is somehow `` tickle '' the Window so that the expose handler is hit with arguments that will enable it to render *just* the part of the window that contains the new item . What is the best way to tickle a window to produce this behavior ?

You 'll have fun looking for the rear-end gears on an SHO -- the Taurus is a front-wheel-drive vehicle ... I went back and checked the article again ; The SHO Wagon is quicker than the SHO automatic , but significantly slower than the REAL SHO . Why anyone would order an SHO with an automatic transmission is beyond me ; if you ca n't handle a stick , you should stick with a regular Taurus and leave the SHO to real drivers . That is not to say that there are n't real drivers who ca n't use the stick ( eg disabled persons ) , but they are n't in any position to use an SHO anyway . I would be willing to bet that if we removed the automatic transmissions from all `` performance-type '' cars ( like the 5.0l Mustangs , Camaros , and the like ) we 'd cut down on the number of accidents each year . Autos are fine for sedate little sedans , but they have no business in performance cars , IMHO . James James P.

Assuming you are presenting it accurately , I do n't see how this argument really leads to any firm conclusion . The material in John ( I 'm not sure exactly what is referred to here , but I 'll take for granted the similarity to the Matt./Luke `` Q '' material ) IS different ; hence , one could have almost any relationship between the two , right up to John getting it straight from Jesus ' mouth . > We are talking date of texts here , not the age of the authors .

Mitchell March 23 , 1993 INTRODUCTION : In order to increase public interest in space-based and lunar operations , a real miniature lunar-like environment is being constructed on which to test tele-operated models . These models are remotely-controlled by individuals located world-wide using their personal computers , for EduTainment purposes . Not only does this provide a test-bed for simple tele-operation and tele-presence activities but it also provides for the sharing of information on methods of operating in space , including , but not limited to , layout of a lunar colony , tele-operating machines for work and play , disseminating educational information , providing contests and awards for creativity and achievement and provides a new way for students worldwide to participate in Twenty-First century remote learning methods . Because of the nature of the LTM1 project , people of all ages , interests and skills can contribute scenery and murals , models and structures , interfacing and electronics , software and graphics . In operation LTM1 is an evolving playground and laboratory that can be used by children , students and professionals worldwide . Using a personal computer at home or a terminal at a participating institution a user is able to tele-operate real models at the LTM1 base for experimental or recreational purposes . Because a real facility exists , ample opportunity is provided for media coverage of the construction of the lunar model , its operation and new features to be added as suggested by the users themselves . This has broad inherent interest for a wide range of groups : - tele-operations and virtual reality research - radio control , model railroad and ham radio operation - astronomy and space planetariums and science centers - art and theater - bbs and online network users - software and game developers - manufacturers and retailers of model rockets , cars and trains - children - the child in all of us LTM1 OVERALL DESIGN : A room 14 feet by 8 feet contains the base lunar layout . The walls are used for murals of distant moon mountains , star fields and a view of the earth . The `` floor '' is the simulated lunar surface . A global call for contributions is hereby made for material for the lunar surface , and for the design and creation of scale models of lunar colony elements , scenery , and machine-lets . The LTM1 initial design has 3 tele-operated machinelets : 1 . An SSTO scale model which will be able to lift off , hover and land ; 2 . A bulldozerlet which will be able to move about in a quarry area ; and 3 . A moon-train which will traverse most of the simulated lunar surface . Each machinelet has a small TV camera utilizing a CCD TV chip mounted on it . A personal computer digitizes the image ( including reducing picture content and doing data-compression to allow for minimal images to be sent to the operator for control purposes ) and also return control signals . The first machinelet to be set up will be the moon-train since model trains with TV cameras built in are almost off-the-shelf items and control electronics for starting and stopping a train are minimal . The user will receive an image once every 1 to 4 seconds depending on the speed of their data link to LTM1 . Next , an SSTO scale model with a CCD TV chip will be suspended from a servo-motor operated wire frame mounted on the ceiling allowing for the SSTO to be controlled by the operator to take off , hover over the entire lunar landscape and land . Finally , some tank models will be modified to be CCD TV chip equipped bulldozerlets . The entire initial LTM1 will allow remote operators worldwide to receive minimal images while actually operating models for landing and takeoff , traveling and doing work . The entire system is based on commercially available items and parts that can be easily obtained except for the interface electronics which is well within the capability of many advanced ham radio operator and computer hardware/software developers . By taking a graphically oriented communications program ( Dmodem ) and adding a tele-operations screen and controls , the necessary user interface can be provided in under 80 man hours . PLAN OF ACTION : The Diaspar Virtual Reality Network has agreed to sponsor this project by providing a host computer network and Internet access to that network . Diaspar is providing the 14 foot by 8 foot facility for actual construction of the lunar model . Diaspar has , in stock , the electronic tanks that can be modified and one CCD TV chip . Diaspar also agrees to provide `` rail stock '' for the lunar train model . Diaspar will make available the Dmodem graphical communications package and modify it for control of the machines-lets . An initial `` ground breaking '' with miniature shovels will be performed for a live photo-session and news conference on April 30 , 1993 . The initial models will be put in place . A time-lapse record will be started for historical purposes . It is not expected that this event will be completely serious or solemn . The lunar colony will be declared open for additional building , operations and experiments . A photographer will be present and the photographs taken will be converted to .gif images for distribution world-wide to major online networks and bbs 's . A press release will be issued calling for contributions of ideas , time , talent , materials and scale models for the simulated lunar colony . A contest for new designs and techniques for working on the moon will then be announced . Universities will be invited to participate , the goal being to find instructors who wish to have class participation in various aspects of the lunar colony model . Field trips to LTM1 can be arranged and at that time the results of the class work will be added to the model . Contributors will then be able to tele-operate any contributed machine-lets once they return to their campus . A monthly LTM1 newsletter will be issued both electronically online and via conventional means to the media . Any major new tele-operated equipment addition will be marked with an invitation to the television news media . Having a large , real model space colony will be a very attractive photo opportunity for the television community . Especially since the `` action '' will be controlled by people all over the world . Science fiction writers will be invited to issue `` challenges '' to engineering and human factors students at universities to build and operate the tele-operated equipment to perform lunar tasks . Using counter-weight and pulley systems , 1/6 gravity may be simulated to some extent to try various traction challenges . The long term goal is creating world-wide interest , education , experimentation and remote operation of a lunar colony . LTM1 has the potential of being a long term global EduTainment method for space activities and may be the generic example of how to teach and explore in many other subject areas not limited to space EduTainment . All of this facilitates the kind of spirit which can lead to a generation of people who are ready for the leap to the stars ! CONCLUSION : EduTainment is the blending of education and entertainment . Anyone who has ever enjoyed seeing miniatures will probably see the potential impact of a globally available layout for recreation , education and experimentation purposes . By creating a tele-operated model lunar colony we not only create world-wide publicity , but also a method of trying new ideas that require real ( not virtual ) skills and open a new method for putting people 's minds in space .

The first HD is'nt terminated > the second will be . > Whats about the power supply . Where can i connect a 3 1/2 '' AMP-Connector > to supply my 3 1/2 '' HD ? It is very possible to connect another internal hard disk in any macintosh if you can find the space to put it . I have a IIsi that came with a Quantum 80 meg drive . When I ran into space problems , I slapped in another 40 meg quantum that I had sitting on a shelf . Here is what I did . First off , I was concerned about space . Since both drives are Quantum quarter height drives , I finally decided that the logical place for them was stacked one upon the other . Fine , they fit snugly . ( I have not had a problem with heat yet , and these drives have been running together for over two months . The next problem was connecting the drive . If you have a spare internal hard disk power cable as I did , then half of your troubles are over . just splice in the extra cable so that you get one square motherboard connector and two hard disk power connectors . If you do n't have a spare cable , you will have to buy the wires and connectors which can be found in any good electronics store for about $ 10 . I would suggest properly soldering/heatshrinking the connections to reduce the possibility of shorts or bad connections . Next , you need a ribbon cable connection . Again , I had a spare hard disk ribbon cable , and I wanted to be careful in case this did n't word so what I did was purchase a crimp on 50 pin cable connector that gave me another male connector in the middle of my spare cable . The part cost $ 10 again , and is easily attached with any good wood vice . The theory behind using a crimp on connector is that if this does n't work , my original cable is not damaged , and I can go back to the original setup . Having done all that , I could n't be bothered to check the dev notes for power consumption so I plugged it in and it works like a charm to this day . In a mac II , everything should work the same . Be careful with the ID 's of the drive , and ensure that the terminating resistors on both drives are intact . I did not try this without the terminating resistors but it seemed logical that if I am splitting the SCSI chain , that the signal should be terminated at all the ends . Let me know if you have any more questions . Peter Hansen Bell Northern Research pgmoffc @ BNR.ca

Andrew Kille writes : > Are you suggesting that God supports genocide ? > Perhaps the Germans were `` punishing '' Jews on God 's behalf ? > > Any God who works that way is indescribably evil , and unworthy of > my worship or faith . The Bible does tell us that governments are ordained by God ( Romans 13 ) . And furthermore , God foreknows everything that would happen . It is just to difficult for humans to graps with our limited minds , the inevitablity of the sucess of God 's plan , and this is especially hard to grasp when we see governemnts doing evil . However , though they are doing evil ( and we should not cooperate with them when they do such ) , it must be understood that what happens is what God wanted so as to lead to the final sucess of His plan to save as many souls from hell as is possible . In short , the slaughter in Bosnia , though deplorable in the eyes of God ( maybe , then again , they might be getting their just deserts now rather than later ; there are plenty of examples of God killing people for their sins - Onan in the Old Testmament for example , and Annias and Spahira in the New ) is what he willed to happen so that His plan might be accomplished . But do n't forget , it is not unbiblical for God to use one nation to execute His just judgement upon another . The Romans were used to fulfill the chorus of `` Let his blood be upon our hands '' of the crowd in Jersualem . And Chaldea was chastised by Babylon , which got Israel , which was inturn gotten by Persia , etc . God does use nations to punish other nations , as the Bible very clearly shows in the Old Testament . Do n't you remember the words of God recorded in Daniel , `` Mene , mene , tekel , peres ? '' Babylon had been weighed in the balance scales of God's justice , found severly wanting , and was thus given over to the Persians as their due punishment for their rebellion . Another exammple is the extirmination of the Cannanites , ordered by God as the task of Israel . The Cannanites had been given their chance , found severly wanting , and the Great Judge , carried out His just sentence accrodingly . I could go on with more examples , but I see little need to do so , as my point is quite clear . Two things need to be remembered at all times . 1 ) It is not up to us to question why God has ordered the world as He has . In His divine Wisdom , He made the world as was best in His eyes , and like Paul says in Romans 9 , the clay is not one to tlak back to the potter . 2 ) The message of Jesus Christ is as follows : `` Repent now , for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand . '' Jesus Christ did not allow any time for dilly-dallying - `` Let the dead bury the dead , come , follow me . '' There is not an infinite amount of time , rather Christ is passing by right now , calling people to follow Him and become fishers of men . He does not say , `` well , alright , you can call me back in a week and see if my Kingdom fits in with your plans . '' He said `` Follow me . '' His message is NOT `` I 'm just a sweety-pie who would never hurt a fly , you 've got all the time in the world , and Divine Judgement , that 's only a fairy tale . '' `` Our great God and Savior '' Jesus Christ ( Titus 2.5 ) is also the just and righteous Judge of the world . And it is not up to the defendants in the trial to be questioning his entirely just sentences of either chastisement or mercy . D. Andrew Byler '' Does not He who ways the heart perceive [ sin ] , and will He not judge men according to their works ? '' - Proverbs 24.12

I have n't seen any speculation about it . But , the Salyut KB ( Design Bureau ) was planning a new LH/LOX second stage for the Proton which would boost payload to LEO from about 21000 to 31500 kg . ( Geostationary goes from 2600 kg . ( Gals launcher version ) to 6000 kg.. This scheme was competing with the Energia-M last year and I have n't heard which won , except now I recently read that the Central Specialized KB was working on the successor to the Soyuz booster which must be the Energia-M . So the early results are Energia-M won , but this is a guess , nothing is very clear in Russia . I 'm sure if Salyut KB gets funds from someone they will continue their development . The Centaur for the Altas is about 3 meters dia . and the Proton is 4 so that 's a good fit for their existing upper stage , the Block-D which sets inside a shround just under 4 meters dia . I do n't know about launch loads , etc.. but since the Centaur survives Titan launches which are probably worse than the Proton ( those Titan SRB 's probably shake things up pretty good ) it seems feasible . EXCEPT , the Centaur is a very fragile thing and may require integration on the pad which is not available now . Protons are assembled and transported horizontially . Does anyone know how much stress in the way of a payload a Centaur could support while bolted to a Proton horizontally and then taken down the rail road track and erected on the pad ? They would also need LOX and LH facilities added to the Proton pads ( unless the new Proton second stage is actually built ) , and of course any Centaur support systems and facilities , no doubt imported from the US at great cost . These systems may viloate US law so there are political problems to solve in addition to the instabilities in the CIS you mention .

If most people } use scissors to cut paper , should n't Consumer 's Reports } test scissors for paper-cutting ability , even though } scissors may have been designed originally to cut cloth ? That 's possibly a good way to judge the use of the Bible in teaching Jewish morality today , but it hardly seems fair to claim that this highly-interpreted version is what was `` enlightened for its times '' . To ( attempt to ) extend the analogy , this is like saying that the original scissor-makers were unusually advanced at paper-cutting for their times , even though they only ever cut cloth , and had never even heard of paper . I 'm not arguing that the Bible is `` disgusting '' , though some of the history depicted in it is , by modern standards . However , history is full of similar abuses , and I do n't think the Biblical accounts are worse than their contemporaries -- or possibly ours . On the other hand , I do n't know of any reason to think the history described in the Bible shows *less* abuse than their contemporaries , or ours .

Not every wild flight of fancy serves ( or can serve ) in the appropriate relation to a hypothesis . It is somewhat interesting that when anyone is challanged to provide an example of this sort the *only* one they come up with is the one about Kekule . Surely , there must be others . But apparently this is regarded as an *extreme* example of a `` non-rational '' process in science whereby a successful hypothesis was proposed . But how non-rational is it ?

From : paj @ uk.co.gec-mrc ( Paul Johnson ) Subject : Peltier Effect Heat Pumps Reply-To : paj @ uk.co.gec-mrc ( Paul Johnson ) Organization : GEC-Marconi Research Centre , Great Baddow , Essex Lines : 45 I was having a look through a couple of components catalogues when I came across a range of Peltier Effect heat pumps intended for cooling components . For those who have not heard of this effect , you put a current through one of these devices , and it pumps heat from one side to the other . Reverse the current and you reverse the effect . I think a temperature difference can give you an EMF as well . Anyway , it struck me that you could make a nice cool/hot box for picnics with one of these , a power regulator , a thermostat and a couple of heat sinks . The biggest device can shift 60W with an efficiency of 80-90 % , which ai n't bad ( although it would flatten my car battery in about half an hour ) . Unfortunately the catalogue did n't list anything more than the basic specs as a heat pump . I imagine that you would get a back-EMF as the temperature gradient across the device increases . If so , presumably its power decreases as the back-EMF increases , until eventually we have a steady state with no current being consumed ( assuming no leakage ) . If so , then the final temperature difference between the two sides could be set by the supply voltage and nothing more ( although that would be a lousy way to control it ) . What I would like to know is : 1 : Are the above guesses correct ? 2 : What is the open-circuit thermal resistance of a typical device ? ( I just want to be sure that my coolbox is not going to get warm too fast when I unplug it ) 3 : How does a Peltier Effect heat pump actually work ? It looks like magic ! 4 : Why do n't they use these things in domestic fridges/freezers ? Thanks in advance , Paul .

Can we perhaps as the question of whether the Constitution might have been written to appeal to the principles , rather than , as you appear to believe , it was written with something else in mind and `` propoganda '' put out by its supporters .

Oh , I have no argument with questioning them . I do n't believe they no longer apply , but that 's because I think most of them were good arguments .

Since the U.S. constitution is the basis for the U.S. political system , most changes in it would require Constitutional change . In this particular case , however the fillibuster is a matter of procedure and tradition .

Phill , we 're discusing the power of legislative houses . While the Prime Minister *is* member of Parliament , he is more analgous ( although badly ) to the U.S. President . Now , please explain to me how the U.S. House of Representatives is `` in principle '' more powerful than the House of Lords ( or the Senate ) but in practice is less . Are you suggesting that the writers of the Constitution *really* intended for them to be more powerful , but gosh darn the thing was ratified before they realized they 'd forgotten to put those extra restrictions on the Senate in ? > | > I disagree .

'' > > One reason for that is that at every level the government is rendered unable > to come to decisions . These decisions are pushed up to the next higher level > instead . Not at all . As any entry level political science course will tell you , people who want laws implemented will always choose the level of government to `` attack '' which presents them with the best chance of getting what they want . With national `` interest groups '' it is simply a very rational thing to do to want the Federal government to enact a law rather than the states . Less people to persuade , and less '' contributions '' to make . Why do those concerned about abortion primarily concentrate at the Federal level ? Simply because if they win that battle all the little state battlefields are won by extension . The same extends to insurance , medicine , and most other questions . Local government has not `` failed '' in that it has n't done what it should , but that it is dominated by local interests . Thus non-local interests who want localities to abide by their rules ca n't get their rules past the local government . Thus , since they 've got more clout , only in the wrong place , they appeal to the next higher level because it can impose its will on the lower . I mean , let 's get real here . Do we *really* need the Congres of the United States deciding that x traffice light should be on thus- and such pattern ? Or that *carjacking* needs to be a federal as opposed to a local crime ? The more people want the more Congress will take power to `` sell '' it to them for their votes . I do n't think the rise of `` special interests '' is coincidence with the increased power of Congress . > | > Congress is more than capable of quick action , and has more than > | > enough power and time on its hands , if it confined itself to what its > | > original jurisidiction was and allowed more local autonomy . > > If they were to start from a social welfare model instead of the current > '' no state subsidy motto '' they would be better placed .

The higher up the governmental ladder the less actual need matters , because political power can be concentrated at higher levels , while people with less cloud only find themselves reduced to in effectiveness . > In order to set up a school project in New York state you have to pay off the > other 49 states with pork - defense contracts , agricultural subsidies etc . > Or to be precise 30 of the states since you need 60 to beat the filibuster . Then why not simply leave New York 's education to New York ? I remain unconcinved that there is any state in the Union which is not capable of educating its own children if that 's what they want to do . And if you leave it to them , you only have to worry about the `` pork '' in that state . And since industries ca n't concentrate their political power and wealth , rather they must divide it among the states to try and get what they want , individual voices have more relative impact . The problem with the fillibuster is not that you must `` buy off '' states , but that the Congress has acquired too much power to sell pork . > | > It is not a case of the system of government they created failing , > | > but that it is operating under a set of conditions they specifically > | > wanted to avoid .

But why on earth should we want to redirect it ? You said yourself that you have to sell pork to get things through Congress . If Congres has less authority to sell pork and retains its authority to enact national legislation within its granted jurisdiction , the pork problem is significantly reduced . > The current blocks on power simply absolve congress of any responsibility > to come to a decision . The current blocks essentially state that inaction is preferable to action , thus it the system is weighted against action . Considering the government the usually the institution with the sole power to enforce its decisions by force , I consider bias against making those decisions a good thing . > Pushing the decisions lower in the pyramid won't > work unless the lower levels are less corrupt . In most cases they are worse , > not better . The difference with the lower pyramid is that a ) they have more legal , legitimate authority in most matters under our Constitution than the federal government , and b ) at those lower levels power is harder to concentrate . And c ) you get the benefit of not imposing new deicisons on everybody at once . You get to see them tried out without a national decision . Congressional action usually treats the entire country as a whole , yet even with similar problems in different areas , different solutions may be called for . And while I often do n't agree with the decisions my local and state reps make , at least I have a better option of going to the city council and shooting my mouth off . I 'd much rather the majority of laws be made by accessible people who hang around and end up having to put up with them rather than somebody far off in Washington with half a million or more constituents . I 'm curious what you base your assumption that lower levels are more corrupt . > | > I fail to see where any restrictions , implied or otherwise , were > | > placed on the veto .

Phill , *you* brought up the Federalist papers . We were arguing the fillibuster and whether or not a minority of Senators should be allowed to hold up a bill . You claimed the Senate was suppose to be a far less powerful House , and I contended there was nothing in the Constitution or other writings which indicated this . Which was when you brought up that we ca n't decide what the founders wanted based on the Federalist papers . You argued against them , I never argued from them . I have primarily referred to the Constitution , which places only very small restrictions on the Senate than for the House . > The > US constitution gives almost no reasoning as to how it should work . The > only part where a reason is given is the right to bear arms ammendment where > the well regulated militia justification is ambiguous . The U.S. Constitution is a nuts-and-bolts document . The Delcaration of Independence was the high-brow reasoning . ( There are a couple of other examples , though , such as the reasoning for the power to tax , and the reasoning for the power to grant permits , both in Article I , Section 8 . ) > That the veto was meant to be an exceptional measure follows from the > fact of the senate .

To a certain extend I do believe the veto has become something it was n't intended . However , I also believe it is inevitable considering the Congress ' own abuse of their power to make bills say whatever they want them to say . Unlike most people I think we should n't be worrying about the veto , which is fine , but of the problem in Congress which almost necessitates its abuse . > | > There is no limit in the Constitution to the President 's veto power > | > regarding what a bill is for .

No , I am completely happy with a system which requires a minority for *action* . Since U.S. history is a history of carving up population groups and implementing piece-meal on minorities , I feel minorities should have sufficent clout to prevent action they feel strongly enough about . And 41 % is hardly a tiny minority . I do n't advocate the minority being capable of initiating actionm but I see no problem with biasing the *federal* system against action . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- David Veal Univ . of Tenn.

Can anybody help me out ? How can you ensure that accelerators work the same independent of case ? What I want is Ctrl+O and Ctrl+o to both be accelerators on one menu entry . In ORA Vol . 6 , in the section on accelerators it says `` For information on how to specify translation tables see Vol . 4 ... '' , this is so you know what to put for the XmNaccelerator resource . If you go to Vol . 4 it says , `` Likewise , if a modifier is specified , there is nothing to prohibit other modifiers from being present as well . For example , the translation : Shift < Key > q : quit ( ) will take effect even if the Ctrl key is held down at the same time as the Shift key ( and the q key ) . This implies to me that setting XmNaccelerator to Ctrl < Key > o should do what I want , but it does n't , it does n't work if the user presses the control key , the shift key , and the o key . Is it possible to supply > 1 accelerator for a menu entry ? Keep in mind when answering this question that when using Motif you ca n't use XtInstallAccelerators ( ) .

The only reason to get an IIvx is if you really need the full-size Nubus slots . Keep in mind that the 610 supports all Apple monitors and has optional Ethernet . This lessens ( but does n't eliminate ) the need for Nubus cards . And unless you 're running FPU-intensive software , the 610 will blow the doors off the LCIII and the IIvx . The LCIII , on the other hand , is sufficient for most people and has a great price . If you have n't guessed , I find halving the bus clock ( the IIvx 32MHz uP vs. 16MHz bus ) a throughly bad thing and I hope Apple never does it again . -- ______________________________________________________________________________ |Joe Finete | |jfinete @ cats.ucsc.edu | -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -

Some said that their heart beat speeded up with flush face . Some > claim their heart `` skipped '' beats once in a while . Both of these symptoms are related - tachycardia . Getting a flushed face is due to the heart pumping the blood faster than a regular pulse . I suspect this is related to an increase in sodium levels in the blood , since note *sodium chloride* monosodium glutamate . Both are sodium compounds . Our bodies require sodium , but like everything else , one can get too much of a good thing . > Some reacted with headache , Again , this could be related to increased blood flow from increased heart rate , from the sodium in the MSG . Distended crainial arteries , essentially . One of many causes of headaches . There is no discrepency her , necessarily . > some stomach ache . Well stomache ache and vomiting tend to be related . Again , not necessarily a discrepency . More likely a related reaction . Vomiting occurs as a response to get rid of a noxious compound an organism has eaten . If a person ca n't digest the stuff ( entirely possible - the list of stuff people are allergic to is quite long ) , and lacks an enzyme to break it down , gastrointestinal distress ( stomach or belly ache ) would be expected . > Some had watery eyes or running nose , These are respiratory reactions , and are now considered to be similar to vomitting . They are a way for the body to dispose of noxious compounds . They are adaptiove responses . Of course , it is possible some other food or environmental compound could be responsible for the symptoms . But it 's important to remember that a lot opf these effets can be additive , synergystic , subtractive , etc , etc . It would be necessary to know exactly what was in a dish , and what else the person was exposed to . Respiratory does sound suspicious BUT resopiration and heart rate are connected . Things in the body are far from simple ... very inetractive place , the vertebrate body . > some > had itchy skin or rashes . People respond in a myriad of ways to the same compound . It depends upon what it is about the compound that `` pisses off '' their body . Pollen , for example , of some plants aggrivates breathing in many people , because , when inhaled , it sets of the immune system , and an histamine attack is launched . The immune system goes overboard , causing the allergic person a lot of misery . And someone with an allergy to some pollens will have trouble with some herb teas that contain pollens ( Chamomile , linden , etc ) . Drinking the substance can perturb that person 's system as much as inhaling it . > More serious accusations include respiration > difficulty See above . And do n't think that heart rate changes , and circulatory problems are not serious . They can be deadly . and brain damage . The area of the brain effected is the neuroendocrine system controlling the release of gonadotropin , the supra-hormone controlling the cyclical release of testosterone and estradiol , as well as somatostatin , and other steroids . Testing for effective dose would be , uh , a wee bit unethical . > Now here is a new one : vomiting . My guess is that MSG becomes the number one > suspect of any problem . In this case . it might be just food poisoning . Absolutely . But it could also be some synergystic mess from eating , say , undetected shrimp or mushrooms ( to which many are allergic ) , plus too much alcohol , and inhaling too much diesel fumes biking home , plus , let 's say , having contracted flu from one 's sig . other 3 days before from drinking out of the same glass . Could be all sorts of things . But it might be the MSG . > if you heard things about MSG , you may think it must be it . If noone else got sick , its likely not food poisoning . Probably stomach flu or an undetected thing the guy 's allergic to . Anyway , the human body 's not a machine ; people vary widely in their responses , and a lot of reactions are due to combinations of things . Dianne Murray wcsbeau @ ccs.carleton.ca

Computation : Define the auxiliary angles p and q by : sin p = sin a sin z cos q = h ( tan u tan p ) , ( 0 < q < 180 degrees ) Conclusion : L = q / 180 ( if q is measured in degrees ) L = q / pi ( if q is measured in radians ) Wait ! But what is h ? The cutoff function h is defined as follows : h ( s ) = s if |s| < 1 = 1 if s > 1 = -1 if s < 1 As an interesting exercise , plot L versus a . The graph will shows how the length of the daylight varies with the time of the year . Experiment with various choices of latitudes and tilt angles .

( Of course , it may be that these extra boxes are so expensive because no one buys them because they are so expensive ... ) NuBus technology is n't a special Apple Proprietry thing ( I have this sneaky feeling that it is licensed from Texas Instruments ? ? ? ) so there is no problem building an expansion box . The difference between NuBus and PDS is that NuBus is a clever interface with lots of neat toys built in to make sure that lots of cards can work together on the same computer . PDS ( processor direct slot ) is just that : here are all the connections to the processor . You can do anything with this and it is as quick as it can be , but there 's no cooperation . You may be able to get double PDS slot adaptors but you try plugging 2 video cards in , and just watch them conflict ! Of course , the extra electronics in a NuBus slot makes it appreciably more expensive , so guess why Apple does n't put it in it 's cheaper machines ?

( At least this was the case in the evangelical churches I grew > up in . ) > > Evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture > to be absolute truth . ( And there are plenty of other examples . ) > Can you reconcile this ? The problem you see here is that some Christians claim things about the Bible which they do n't actually believe or practice . I 've known all sorts of Christians , ranging from the trendiest of liberals to the fire-breathing fundamentalists , and although many on the conservative side of the Christian faith do claim that the Bible is a ( perhaps *the* ) source of absolute truth , I do n't know of anyone who treats it as anything other than a valuable part of a living tradition . While I am not a Roman Catholic , I believe this is close to the official position of the RC church ( perhaps an RC would like to comment ) . The particular practice you refer to will usually be explained in terms of the social context of the time . You would think the fact that the conservatives seem to have to break out the tophat-and-cane and give you some big song-and-dance routine about why this ( other passages as well ) are n't directly applicable today would show them that what they claim about the Bible and what they actually practice are two different things , but mostly it doens't . While this thread is supposed to be about the arrogance of Christians , I would suggest that some of the problem is really hypocrasy , in this case , making claims about the Bible which the claimants do n't actually put into practice . But if we step back from the name-calling and look at what people are attempting to say , we see that they are trying to express very concisely the unique place the Bible holds within the Christian faith . So when people use such words or phrases as `` Word of God '' , `` inerrant '' , `` infallibale '' , `` The Manufacturer 's Handbook '' , `` The only rule of faith and practice in the church today '' to describe the Bible , we should try to hear what they are saying and not just look at the mere words they use . Some of the above descriptions are demostratably false and others are self-contradictory , but in my experience people are generally pretty good at picking out the intention of the speaker even when the speaker 's words are at variance with their intentions . A Biblical example is from the garden of Eden where God asks `` Where are you ? '' and Adam explains that he was naked and afraid and hid himself . If Adam had answered God 's words he would have said something like `` I 'm here in this tree . '' The problem seems to arise when Christians insist that these words are indeed accurate reflections of their beleif . Most people have not made a determined effort to work out their own understanding of the place of the Bible within their own faith and so rely on the phrases and explanations that others use . I hope this helps . -- ___ Bill Rea ( o o ) -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -w -- U -- w -- - | Bill Rea , Computer Services Centre , | E-Mail b.rea @ csc.canterbury.ac.nz | | University of Canterbury , | or cctr114 @ csc.canterbury.ac.nz | | Christchurch , New Zealand | Phone ( 03 ) -642-331 Fax ( 03 ) -642-999 | -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -

Foul ( Any illegal contact with the other player or his stick with your body or stick ) . If you get 5 you are out for the game . 2 . Unsportsmanlike contact . ( An intentional foul ) . This inlcludes all the current flavours of roughing , fighting and boarding . If you get two you are thrown out of the game , and fined . 3 . Technical foul . Bad mouthing the ref , by player or coach . Penalty shot is awarded . Two and you are thrown out of the game . Besides the penalty shot for one technical , if the team gets 5 penalties in a period , the opposing team gets a penalty shot for every additional one , until the end of the period . The victim gets two shots if he/she was in the act of shooting when the foul ocured . This works well for several reasons . First , penalty shots are the most exciting thing in hockey , right ? So , it follows that the more the better . Next , when the player is setting up for a penalty shot , the network can take a commercial . Finally , with only three penalties , the network announcers ( Don Meredith , Dick Vitale , John Madden , Pat Summerall , and Marv Levy , among others ) will be able to tell the viewers what happened before the PA announcer says it . Oh , one other rule . When a goal is scored ( 10-20 times a period ) , the play can not resume until the PA announcer announces it . This way , the network can sneak in a few more commercials . Then , once the PA announcer has told them who scored , the TV announcer can tell you the viewer , and even have a chance of pronouncing his name right . Seriously , though , I actually went to see a NBA basketball game last week , for the first time in my life . I was amazed how boring it was . The play is so slow they actually had fans come out for things like free-throw shooting contests DURING THE PERIOD ! . Of course the 'Laker Girls ' get to do their routines at least 6-8 times during the game , and not just between periods either . There is a whistle every 30 seconds on average , maybe less . The game is 48 minutes , with 2 minutes between quarters 1-2 and 3-4 and a 10 minute halftime , and it still takes over 2 hours . The reason for this has to be TV . There is plenty of room to throw in commercials , and have the announcer jabber while nothing else is happening . On TV , basketball is fairly entertaining , IMHO . But , it is better to watch it on TV than to be there . If this is the road the NHL is following , then it truly is a sad day . Enough for now . dvb

If there are more guns in circulation , if follows that more people will be killed with them 'cause they are available to the person intent on committing a crime _regardless_ of whether they have to do it with a gun , knife , or bare hands . The gun control lobby does n't seem to understand this point . If people are intent on committing a crime , they will do it with whatever means are available to them . aaron arc @ cco.caltech.edu

Either there is some connection between the text , the fact that it exists , and your interpretation of it , or it is purely arbitrary.. Further , the question is why is has one to carry the burden of Biblical texts when one could simply write other books that convey the message better . You might answer that one ca n't becuase some peculiar Biblical information might be lost , but that holds true of every other book , and the question remains why has the Bible still a special place ?

And the argument you have given is a fallacy , while it may not be important in the context you have given to find out if god is corporeal or not , it can be crucial in other questions . Religious believers resolve contradictions with that they choose one of the possibilities given in an arbitrary way , and have the advantage of being able to attribute their decision to some god . One can not resolve questions by the statement do what is good when what is good depends on the question . Benedikt

I think the purpose the original poster was trying to serve is to avoid the SIGNIFICANT amount of disk access that Windows does on startup . It 's like it 's trying to it 's bit in wearing the damn drive out . I estimate it 's only reading a Mb of programs & data , but from the performance the drive gives , it sounds like they are scattered all over the drive ( my drive is however regularily compressed ) .

Subject : Space FAQ 02/15 - Network Resources From : leech @ cs.unc.edu ( Jon Leech ) Expires : 6 May 1993 19:54:26 GMT Organization : University of North Carolina , Chapel Hill Keywords : Frequently Asked Questions Supersedes : < net_730956391 @ cs.unc.edu > NNTP-Posting-Host : mahler.cs.unc.edu Lines : 241 Archive-name : space/net Last-modified : $ Date : 93/04/01 14:39:15 $ NETWORK RESOURCES OVERVIEW You may be reading this document on any one of an amazing variety of computers , so much of the material below may not apply to you . In general , however , systems connected to 'the net ' fall in one of three categories : Internet , Usenet , or BITNET . Electronic mail may be sent between these networks , and other resources available on one of these networks are sometimes accessible from other networks by email sent to special 'servers ' . The space and astronomy discussion groups actually are composed of several mechanisms with ( mostly ) transparent connections between them . One mechanism is the mailing list , in which mail is sent to a central distribution point which relays it to all recipients of the list . In addition to the general lists for space ( called SPACE Digest for Internet users , and SPACE on BITNET ) , there are a number of more specialized mailing lists described below . A second mechanism is Usenet 'netnews ' . This is somewhat like a bulletin board operating on each system which is a part of the net . Netnews separates contributions into hundreds of different categories based on a 'group name ' . The groups dealing most closely with space topics are called 'sci.space.news ' , 'sci.space ' , 'sci.space.shuttle ' , 'sci.astro ' , and 'talk.politics.space ' . Contributors 'post ' submissions ( called 'articles ' in netnews terminology ) on their local machine , which sends it to other nearby machines . Similarly , articles sent from nearby machines are stored locally and may be forwarded to other systems , so that an article is posted locally and eventually reaches all the Usenet sites interested in receiving the news group to which the article was posted . Gateway machines redirect the Usenet sci.space group into Internet and BITNET mailing lists and vice versa ; the other Usenet groups are not accessible as mailing lists . If you can receive netnews , its more flexible interface and access to a wider range of material usually make it the preferred option . MAILING LISTS SPACE Digest is the main Internet list , and is now being run by the International Space University ( in only its second change of management in over a decade ) . Email space-request @ isu.isunet.edu ( message body should be in the format 'subscribe space John Public ' ) to join . Note that the moderated SPACE Magazine list is defunct at present for lack of a moderator . Old copies of SPACE Digest since its inception in 1981 are available by anonymous FTP . Retrieve julius.cs.qub.ac.uk : pub/SpaceDigestArchive/README for further details . Elements is a moderated list for fast distribution of Space Shuttle Keplerian Elements before and during Shuttle flights . NASA two line elements are sent out on the list from Dr. Kelso , JSC , and other sources as they are released . Email to elements-request @ telesoft.com to join . GPS Digest is a moderated list for discussion of the Global Positioning System and other satellite navigation positioning systems . Email to gps-request @ esseye.si.com to join . Space-investors is a list for information relevant to investing in space-related companies . Email Vincent Cate ( vac @ cs.cmu.edu ) to join . Space-tech is a list for more technical discussion of space topics ; discussion has included esoteric propulsion technologies , asteroid capture , starflight , orbital debris removal , etc . Email to space-tech-request @ cs.cmu.edu to join . Archives of old digests and selected excerpts are available by anonymous FTP from gs80.sp.cs.cmu.edu ( 128.2.205.90 ) in /usr/anon/public/space-tech , or by email to space-tech-request if you do n't have FTP access . SEDS-L is a BITNET list for members of Students for the Exploration and Development of Space and other interested parties . Email LISTSERV @ TAMVM1.BITNET with a message saying `` SUBSCRIBE SEDS-L your name '' . Email saying `` INDEX SEDS-L '' to list the archive contents . SEDSNEWS is a BITNET list for news items , press releases , shuttle status reports , and the like . This duplicates material which is also found in Space Digest , sci.space , sci.space.shuttle , and sci.astro . Email LISTSERV @ TAMVM1.BITNET saying `` SUBSCRIBE SEDSNEWS your name '' to join . Email saying `` INDEX SEDSNEWS '' to list the archive contents . Ron Baalke ( baalke @ kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov ) runs a mailing list which carries the contents of the sci.space.news Usenet group . Email him to join the list . As a general note , please mail to the *request* address to get off a mailing list . SPACE Digest , for example , relays many inappropriate 'please remove me from this list ' messages which are sent to the list address rather than the request address . PERIODICALLY UPDATED INFORMATION In addition to this FAQ list , a broad variety of topical information is posted to the net ( unless otherwise noted , in the new group sci.space.news created for this purpose ) . Please remember that the individuals posting this information are performing a service for all net readers , and do n't take up their time with frivolous requests .

Your aggressions thru > Turkey at anytime in the past did not get you any reward and shall > not get you anywhere . Do n't swallow propaganda as truth Sir . British promised to Venizelos ( greek PM ) that mainly greek populated areas of the Ottomans will be given to Greece , _if_ he will agree to drag Greece in the side of the British during the WWI ( because the greek King was proGerman ) . The British succeeded by bombarding Athens ( 1916 ) , killing quite a few , forcing abdication of the King , division of Greece into two separate states ( North-South ) , and finally laying the ground for the most disasterous division between greeks for our century . ( So do n't feel bitter that the '' Allies '' gave any green light because they liked us ... . ) Anyway , the British succeed to establish Venizelos , war starts at a second front against the Germans in the south while they were fighting the war in the East against the Russians , and finally the WWII came in an end . After that the British ( and French ) forgot immediately their promises ( as usually ) . Even though publicly they say that they support the Greek cause , practically they not only do nothing , but instead , using some usual '' reasoning '' and other crap rhetoric as a pretext , they gradually backup Kemal ( who had given now to the British `` water and bread '' that he will dissolve the superethnic Ottoman and contract it into a small ethnic-state ) . The main drive behind this British switch was the plan to keep a Muslim state in the region as buffer against a Russian expansion into warm-water facilities . The `` greek empire '' being an Orthodox Christian state was too prone to become Russian client . Out of this intrigue , the current state of affairs was established on our lands . While Venizelos and Kemal were promoted as true `` Giants '' by the British , since they worked to realize their goals in the region . Under the same plan , currently Greece and Turkey are recipients of big military funds from the US ; both they are functioning as anti-Russian buffers , while simultaneously both remain good clients of State Dept . because otherwise the use of terror of changing `` the balance of power in the Aegean '' will be used . Under the same exact rational you should see the Cyprus problem . Gr PS : I do n't make any anti- ... whatever rhetoric . This is the situation in our region and needs to be said . The previously mentioned powers are not anything special ; they are fucntioning the same way which anyone else functions all throughout history . So I do n't selectively single them out ; just they are relevant to _our_ current afairs .

In the `` sex ed '' portion of the high school `` health '' course I took in 1984 , it was impressed that the only 100 % positive way to *not* get pregnant was to *not* have sex . Other methods of contraception were discussed , in the framework of a chart which showed both the _expected_ failure rate ( theoretical , assumes no mistakes ) and the _actual_ failure rate ( based on research ) . Top of the chart was something like this : Method Expected Actual -- -- -- Failure Rate Failure Rate Abstinence 0 % 0 % And NFP ( Natural Family Planning ) was on the bottom . The teacher even said , `` I 've had some students tell me that they ca n't use anything for birth control because they 're Catholic . Well , if you 're not married and you 're a practicing Catholic , the *top* of the list is your slot , not the *bottom* . Even if you 're not religious , the top of the list is safest .

From : dave @ einstein.andi.org ( David Scheck ) Subject : imake ( X11R4 ) cpp problems on AIX Keywords : imake X11R4 AIX Nntp-Posting-Host : einstein.andi.org Organization : Association of NeXTSTEP Developers International Lines : 28 I am trying to build and use imake ( X11R4 ) on an IBM RS/6000 running AIX V3.2 . I am having the following 2 problems . ( 1 ) Many of my Imakefile 's have contructs like /**/ # This is a makefile at the start of lines to pass Makefile comments thru the C preprocessor and into the Makefile . Most of the C preprocessors that I have used will not treat such a # as appearing at the start of the line . Thus the C preprocessor does not treat the hash symbol as the start of a directive . However the IBM cpp strips the comment and treats the hash symbol as the start of a directive . The cpp fails when it determines that `` This '' is not a known directive . I have temporarily hacked my imake to handle this situation but would like to come up with a better fix . ( 2 ) Several Imakefiles use /**/ as a parameter to a macro when a particular use of the macro does not need a value for the parameter . The AIX cpp gives warnings about these situations but continues to work OK . If you are familiar with these problems and have solutions , I would appreciate information about on your solutions .

Jobs ? What the hell have jobs to do with it ? It 's another touchy-feely program from the new , vapid administration . The fact is , the major claim made for `` universal '' immunization -- that `` all children will be immunized '' -- has absolutely no validity . Several states already have U.I . programs , have had these programs for _years_ . The result : on average , their success rates are no better than the national average .

B2 : Male sex survey : Gay activity low A new natonal study on male sexual behavior , the most thorough examination of American men 's sexual practices published since the Kinsey report more than four decades ago , shows about 2 percent of the men surveyed had engaged in homosexual sex and 1 percent considered themselves exclusively homosexual . The figures on homosexuality in the study released Wednesday by the Alan Guttmacher Institute are significantly lower than the 10 percent figure that has been part of the conventional wisdom since it was published in the Kinsey report . The article also contains numbers on the number of sexual partners . The median number of sexual partners for all men 20-39 was 7.3 . Compared to the table I have already posted from Masters , Johnson , and Kolodny showing male homosexual partners , it is apparent that homosexual men are dramatically more promiscuous than the general male population . It 's a shame that we do n't have a breakdown for straight men vs. gay/bi men -- that would show even more dramatically how much more promiscuous gay/bi men are . -- Clayton E.

From : caronni @ nessie.cs.id.ethz.ch ( Germano Caronni ) Subject : Re : More technical details Organization : Swiss Federal Institute of Technology ( ETH ) , Zurich , CH Lines : 120 Hmm , followup on my own posting ... Well , who cares . First let me try to work out the facts that we get to know about the Clipper-Chip , from what Hellman and Denning were able to tell us : The chip itself is not confined to ( digital ) telephony , but performs general encryption in a symmetric manner . The chip supports CFB OFB ECB ( and whatever the fourth mode of operation for DES is ) , the algorithm consists of 32 rounds of *whatever* , and takes 80-Bit keys . Input data seems to be 64 Bit ? Yes . So if two people want secure communication ( whatever that means when Clipper is involved ) they have first to agree on ONE secret key . ( Or is it one key per direction ? ) They can exchange this key via DH-schemes or however . Somehow the two feed their so won secret key into the Clipper-chip which is now ready to work . The clipper chip carries an unique Serial-Number ( 30 Bit 's ) , and 160 Key-Bits . These 160 key-bits seem to have been gained by encrypting the serial-number with 160 seed-bits . ( The seed-bits seem not to be stored in the chip ) At beginning of communication ( and perhaps at certain invtervals whithin ? ? ) before sending the fist real 64-bit output of the first encryption the Clipper chip put 's out packets ( I guess 3 ) which represent the serial number , and the session key . This might look like X { E [ K ; chipkeyK1+K2 ] , serial number } where X is a transformation of these 3 ? Packets involving a family-key . This family ( sp ? ) -key is equal for ALL chips . ( X might be a simple XOR ? ? ? ) After that , the ( digital ? ) phone-call can be done as usual , every packet being encrypted and decrypted by Clipper . Denning describes how K1 and K2 shall be generated , using a seed of 160 Bit 's . Now , leaving alone politics , which does not concern me as much as you , not being an American Citicien ( tm ) [ : - ) ] , there are some weak points in this scheme , which might be exploited by several parties . As far as I know about the generation of K1 , K2 ; S1 and S2 look like the obvious backdoor . They could be used to generate the chip-keys by knowing the serial-number ( and also the family-key ) of the chip . I really can't imagine why these seeds would be needed otherwise , as true random-sources for the generation of the K1 , K2 can be bought for not to much money . Then , the escrows . Each of them will get 80 bit of a 160-Bit key . Security could ( as little as existant ) be maximized by giving them 160-bits each , which have to be xored together to give the K1 , K2 . Now let 's simply assume the escrows are trustworthy , and ca n't be fooled by criminals or law enforchemnt agencies . ( And there will be no quarrel between escrows and l.e.a which would hinder the l.e.a in doing their duties , and so on and so on ) Once the keys are surrendered , the corresponding chip is compromised forever . Not very clever , IMHO [ : - ) ) ] . How about sending in the encrypted session-keys for each phone-call that the police ( or whoever ) want 's to listen to ? Escrows could then simply decode this session-key and send it back to police . ( And would naturally not do this after the warrant has expired ... ) This would be a better technical solution , but I guess politics will not work that way . Apparently ( as Miss Dennings stated ) the only one performing actually decodes of intercepted messages shall be the FBI . Great . So local guys can not inter- cept ( understand ) your traffic anymore . Does this mean that the FBI monopolizes the right to do legal wiretaps ? ( How is law over there , I have no idea who is allowed to tap , and who not ) This certainly means that watched communi- cations will be routed automatically from the service-providing company to the FBI , if the communicaiton is a watched one . And this means as far as I understand it that the family-key has to be known by each switching- company , and those providing cellular-phone servies etcetc . So the family-key will not be very secret , and thus serial-numbers of calls will be readable by anybody who cares . I _like_ traffic-analysis ! What do you guess , what happens , if you use the chip in ECB mode , and the first few packets of the chip are somehow lost or garbled ? So the session key would not be actually broadcasted over the line ? Hmmm . Should n't be so difficult to do *that* : ^ ) And now a last point , for the other side . After all I have read and heard about Clipper ( not the programming language for dBase , is it ? [ : - ) ] ) it seems to have many advantages , which shold not be overseen ! Now an afterthought to your rights . Please note that I have no idea what I am talking about ! ! !

Check out # 27903 , just some 20 posts before your own . Maybe you missed it amidst the flurry of responses ? Yet again , the use of this newsgroup is hampered by people not restricting their posts to matters they have substantial knowledge of . For cites on MSG , look up almost anything by John W. Olney , a toxicologist who has studied the effects of MSG on the brain and on development . It is undisputed in the literature that MSG is an excitotoxic food additive , and that its major constituent , glutamate is essentially the premierie neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain ( humans included ) . Too much in the diet , and the system gets thrown off . Glutamate and aspartate , also an excitotoxin are necessary in small amounts , and are freely available in many foods , but the amounts added by industry are far above the amounts that would normally be encountered in a ny single food . By eating lots of junk food , packaged soups , and diet soft drinks , it is possible to jack your blood levels so high , that anyone with a sensitivity to these compounds will suffer numerous *real* physi9logical effects . Read Olney 's review paper in Prog . Brain Res , 1988 , and check *his* sources . They are impecable . There is no dispute . -- Dianne Murray wcsbeau @ ccs.carleton.ca

From : banschbach @ vms.ocom.okstate.edu Subject : Candida ( yeast ) Bloom , Fact or Fiction Lines : 187 Nntp-Posting-Host : vms.ocom.okstate.edu Organization : OSU College of Osteopathic Medicine I can not believe the way this thread on candida ( yeast ) has progressed . Steve Dyer and I have been exchanging words over the same topic in Sci . Med . Nutrition when he displayed his typical reserve and attacked a women poster for being treated by a liscenced physician for a disease that did not exist . Calling this physician a quack was reprehensible Steve and I see that you and some of the others are doing it here as well . Let me tell you who the quacks really are , these are the physicans who have no idea how the human body interacts with it 's environment and how that balance can be altered by diet and antibiotics . These are the physicians who dismiss their patients with difficult symptomatology and make them go from doctor to doctor to find relief ( like Elaine in Sci . Med . Nutrition ) and then when they find one that solves their problem , the rest start yelling quack . Could it just be professional jealousy ? I could n't help Elaine or Jon but somebody else did . Could they know more than Me ? No way , they must be a quack . I 've been teaching a human nutrition course for Medical students for over ten years now and guess who the most receptive students are ? Those that were raised on farms and saw first-hand the effect of diet on the health of their farm animals and those students who had made a dramatic diet change prior to entering medical school ( switched to the vegan diet ) . Typically , this is about 1/3 of my class of 90 students . Those not interested in nutrition either tune me out or just stop coming to class . That 's okay because I know that some of what I 'm teaching is going to stick and there will be at least a few `` enlightened '' physicians practicing in the U.S . It 's really too bad that most U.S. medical schools do n't cover nutrition because if they did , candida would not be viewed as a non-disease by so many in the medical profession . In animal husbandry , an animal is reinnoculated with `` good '' bacteria after antibiotics are stopped . Medicine has decided that since humans do not have a ruminant stomach , no such reinnoculation with `` good '' bacteria is needed after coming off a braod spectrum antibiotic . Humans have all kinds of different organisms living in the GI system ( mouth , stomach , small and large intestine ) , sinuses , vagina and on the skin . These are nonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune system is compromised . They are also called nonpathogens because unlike the pathogenic organisms that cause human disease , they do not produce toxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body . But any of these organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up residence within the body . A poor mucus membrane barrier can let this happen and vitamin A is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier . Steve got real upset with Elaine 's doctor because he was using anti-fungals and vitamin A for her GI problems . If Steve really understoood what vitamin A does in the body , he would not ( or at least should not ) be calling Elaine 's doctor a quack . Here is a brief primer on yeast . Yeast infections , as they are commonly called , are not truely caused by yeasts . The most common organism responsible for this type of infection is Candida albicans or Monilia which is actually a yeast-like fungus . An infection caused by this organism is called candidiasis . Candidiasis is a very rare occurance because , like an E. Coli infection , it requires that the host immune system be severly depressed . Candida is frequently found on the skin and all of the mucous membranes of normal healthy people and it rarely becomes a problem unless some predisposing factor is present such as a high blood glucose level ( diabetes ) or an oral course of antibiotics has been used . In diabetics , their secretions contain much higher amounts of glucose . Candida , unlike bacteria , is very limited in it 's food ( fuel ) selection . Without glucose , it can not grow , it just barely survives . If it gets access to a lot of glucose , it blooms and over rides the other organisms living with it in the sinuses , GI tract or vagina . In diabetics , skin lesions can also foster a good bloom site for these little buggers . The bloom is usually just a minor irritant in most people but some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus membrane or skin bloom site . Whether this is an allergic like reaction to the candida or not is n't certain . When the bloom is in the vagina or on the skin , it can be easliy seen and some doctors do then try to `` treat '' it . If it 's internal , only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty nondiscript . Candida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in the sinuses , the GI tract ( mouth , stomach and intestines ) and in the vaginal tract which compete with it for food . The human immune system ususally does not bother itself with these ( nonpathogenic organisms ) unless they broach the mucus membrane `` barrier '' . If they do , an inflammatory response will be set up . Most Americans are not getting enough vitamin A from their diets . About 30 % of all American 's die with less Vitamin A than they were born with ( U.S. autopsy studies ) . While this low level of vitamin A does not cause pathology ( blindness ) it does impair the mucus membrane barrier system . This would then be a predisposing factor for a strong inflammatory response after a candida bloom . While diabetics can suffer from a candida `` bloom '' the most common cause of this type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which knock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main competition for candida as far as food is concerned . While drugs are available to handle candida , many patients find that their doctor will not use them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection . The toxicity of the anti-fungal drugs does warrant some caution . But if the GI or sinus inflammation is suspected to be candida ( and recent use of a broad spectrum antibiotic is the smoking gun ) , then anti-fungal use should be approrpriate just as the anti-fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring vaginal yeast infections , in spite of what Mr. Steve Dyer says . But even in patients being given the anti-fungals , the irritation caused by the excessive candida bloom in the sinus , GI tract or the vagina tends to return after drug treatment is discontinued unless the underlying cause of the problem is addressed ( lack of a `` good '' bacterial flora in the body and/or poor mucus membrane barrier ) . Lactobacillus acidophilus is the most effective therapy for candida overgrowth . From it 's name , it is an acid loving organism and it sets up an acidic condition were it grows . Candida can not grow very well in an acidic environment . In the vagina , L. acidophilius is the predominate bacteria ( unless you are hit with broad spectrum antibiotics ) . In the GI system , the ano-rectal region seems to be a particularly good reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very favorable environment around the rectum for transfer ( through moisture and humidity ) of candida to the vaginal tract . One of the most effctive ways to minimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear . If the bloom occurs in the anal area , the burning , swelling , pain and even blood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids . If the bloom manages to move further up the GI tract , very diffuse symptomatology occurs ( abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool ) . This positive stool for occult blood is what sent Elaine to her family doctor in the first place . After extensive testing , he told her that there was nothing wrong but her gut still hurt . On to another doctor , and so on . Richard Kaplan has told me throiugh e-mail that he considers occult blood tests in stool specimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of false positives ( candida blooms guys ? ) . If my gut hurt me on a constant basis , I would want it fixed . Yes it 's nice to know that I do n't have colon cancer but what then is causing my distress ? When I finally find a doctor who treats me and gets me 90 % better , Steve Dyer calls him a quack . Candida prefers a slightly alkaline environment while bacteria tend to prefer a slightly acidic environment . The vagina becomes alkaline during a woman 's period and this is often when candida blooms in the vagina . Vinegar and water douches are the best way of dealing with vaginal problems . Many women have also gotten relief from the introduction of Lactobacillus directly into the vaginal tract ( I would want to be sure of the purity of the product before trying this ) . My wife had this vagina problem after going on birth control pills and searched for over a year until she found a gynocologist who solved the problem rather than just writting scripts for anti-fungal creams . This was a woman gynocologist who had had the same problem ( recurring vaginal yeast infections ) . This M.D . did some digging and came up with an acetic acid and L. Acidophilis douche which she used in your office to keep it sterile . After three treatments , sex returned to our marraige . I have often wondered what an M.D . with chronic GI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his patients is a non-existent syndrome . The nonpathogenic bacteria L. acidophilus is an acid producing bacteria which is the most common bacteria found in the vaginal tract of healthy women . If taken orally , it can also become a major bacteria in the gut . Through aresol sprays , it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranes . But before this innoculation occurs , the mucus membrane barrier system needs to be strengthened . This is accomplished by vitamin A , vitamin C and some of the B-complex vitamins . Diet surveys repeatedly show that Americans are not getting enough B6 and folate . These are probably the segement of the population that will have the greatest problem with this non-existent disorder ( candida blooms after antibiotic therapy ) . Some of the above material was obtained from `` Natural Healing '' by Mark Bricklin , Published by Rodale press , as well as notes from my human nutrition course . I will be posting a discussion of vitamin A sometime in the future , along with reference citings to point out the extremely important role that vitamin A plays in the mucus membrane defense system in the body and why vitamin A should be effective in dealing with candida blooms . Another effective dietary treatment is to restrict carbohydrate intake during the treatment phase , this is especially important if the GI system is involved . If candida can not get glucose , it 's not going to out grow the bacteria and you then give bacteria , which can use amino acids and fatty acids for energy , a chance to take over and keep the candida in check once carbohydrate is returned to the gut . If Steve and some of the other nay-sayers want to jump all over this post , fine . I jumped all over Steve in Sci . Med . Nutrition because he verbably accosted a poster who was seeking advice about her doctor 's use of vitamin A and anti-fungals for a candida bloom in her gut . People seeking advice from newsnet should not be treated this way . Those of us giving of our time and knowledge can slug it out to our heart 's content . If you saved your venom for me Steve and left the helpless posters who are timidly seeking help alone , I would n't have a problem with your behavior . Martin Banschbach , Ph.D .

The article starts with `` A leader of the NASA team in charge of redesigning the planned space station said yesterday the job is tough and may be impossible . '' O'Connor is quoted saying whether it is possible to cut costs that much and still provide for meaningful research `` is a real question for me . '' O'Connor said `` everything is fair game , '' including '' dropping or curtailing existing contracts with the aerospace industry , chopping management of the space station program at some NASA facilities around the country , working closely with the Russian space station Mir , and using unmanned Titan rockets to supplement the manned space shuttle fleet . '' O'Connor says his team has reviewed 30 design options so far , and they are sorting the serious candidates into three categories based on cost . The Post says O'Connor described the design derived from the current SSF as a high cost option ( I believe Kathy Sawyer , the Post writer , got confused here . I listened in on part of O'Connor 's briefing to the press on Monday , and in one part of the briefing O'Connor talked about how the White House wants three options , sorted by cost [ low , medium , and high ] . In another part of the briefing , he discussed the three teams he has formed to look at three options [ SSF derivative @ LaRC , modular buildup with Bus-1 @ MSFC , and Single Launch Core [ `` wingless Orbiter '' ] @ JSC . Later , in response to a reporters question , I thought I heard O'Connor say the option based on a SSF redesign was a `` moderate '' cost option , in between low & high cost options . Not the `` high cost '' option as Sawyer wrote ) . The article goes on to describe the other two options as `` one features modules that could gradually be fitted together in orbit , similar to the Russian Mir . The other is a core facility that could be deposited in orbit in a single launch , like Skylab . That option would use existing hardware from the space shuttle - the fuselage , for example , in its basic structure . '' The last sentence in the article contradicts the title & the first paragraph . The sentence reads `` He [ O'Connor ] said a streamlined version of the planned space station Freedom is still possible within the administration 's budget guidelines . ''

From : mauaf @ csv.warwick.ac.uk ( Mr P D Simmons ) Subject : Why religion and which religion ? Organization : Computing Services , University of Warwick , UK Lines : 46 My family has never been particularly religious - singing Christmas carols is about the limit for them . Thus I 've never really believed in God and heaven , although I do n't actually believe that they do n't exist either - I 'm sort of undecided , probably like a lot of people I guess . Lately I 've been thinking about it all a lot more , and I wondered how religious people can be so convinced that there is a God . I feel as though I want to believe , but I 'm not used to believing things without proof - just as I ca n't believe that there definitely is n't a God , so I can't definitely believe that there is . I wondered if most of you were brought up by religious families and never believed any different . Can anyone help me to understand how your belief and faith in God can be so strong . Another question that frequently crosses my mind is which religion is correct ? ? How do you choose a religion , and how do you know that the Christian God exists and the Gods of other religions do n't ? ? How do you feel about people who follow other religions ? ? How about atheists ? ? And people like me - agnostics I suppose . Do you respect their religion , and accept their beliefs as just as valid as your own ? ? Is n't there contradiction between the religions ? ? How can your religion be more valid than any others ? ? Do you have less respect for someone if they 're not religious , or if they follow a different religion than you would if they were Christian ? ? Also , how much of the scriptures are correct ? ? Are all events in the bible really supposed to have happened , or are they just supposed to be stories with morals showing a true Christian how to behave ? ? I generally follow most of the Christian ideas , which I suppose are fairly universal throughout all religions - not killing , stealing , etc , and 'Loving my neighbour ' for want of a better expression . The only part I find hard is the actual belief in God . Finally , what is God 's attitude to people like me , who do n't quite believe in Him , but are generally fairly 'good ' people . Surely not believing does n't make me a worse person ? ? If not , I find myself wondering why I so strongly want to really believe , and to find a religion . Sorry if I waffled on a bit - I was just writing ideas as they came into my head . I 'm sure I probably repeated myself a bit too .

[ I have no wish to go into the Cyprus quarrel , but I suspect what I 've said is not only accurate but also palatable to all parties involved ] BM ] Yes indeed Turkey has the military prowess to intervene , what she wishes BM ] she had , however , is the diplomatic power to stop the hostilities and bring BM ] the parties to the negotiating table . That 's hard to do when Armenians BM ] are attacking Azeri towns . henrik ] So , let me understand in plain WORDS what you are saying ; Turkey henrik ] wants a PEACEFUL END to this CONFLICT . NOT ! ! So what do you think we want ? War , death and destruction ? henrik ] I will believe it when I see it . No , if you allow yourself to believe it you just might see it . henrik ] Now , as far as attacking , what do you do when you see a GUN pointing henrik ] to your HEAD ? Do you sit there and WATCH or DEFEND yoursef ( fat chance ) ? This kind of childish rhetoric does n't help anthing . henrik ] Do you remember what Azeris did to the Armenians in BAKU ? All the henrik ] BARBERIAN ACTS especially against MOTHERS and their CHILDREN . I mean henrik ] BURNING people ALIVE ! Now , some Azeri will come out and give a description of similar stuff perpetrated by Armenians . One should re-hash stuff like this often to keep the hatred alive , right ? BM ] Armenian leaders are lacking the statesmanship to recognize the BM ] futility of armed conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that BM ] leads to stability is much better than a military faits accomplis that 's BM ] going to cause incessant skirmishes . henrik ] Armenians in KARABAKH want PEACE and their own republic . They are henrik ] NOT asking much . They simply want to get back what was TAKEN AWAY henrik ] from them and GIVEN to AZERIS by STALIN . Well they obviously are n't getting anywhere with their current methods of asking ( not very peaceful I 'd say ) . BM ] Think of 10 or 20 years down the line -- both of the newly independent BM ] countries need to develop economically and neither one is going to wipe BM ] the other out . These people will be neighbors , would it not be better BM ] to keep the bad blood between them minimal ? henrik ] Do n't get me WRONG . I also want PEACEFUL solution to the henrik ] conflict . But until Azeris realize that , the Armenians in henrik ] KARABAKH will defend themselves against aggresion . I do n't know if you want a solution or just want to exchange slogans . Peace is n't what 's happening right now , furthermore what 's happening right now is n't condusive to peace . You can spend days and nights raving about how 'right ' the Armenian position is and I 'm sure there 'll be others who 'd be happy to talk to you by arguing the other side . If entrenched positions lead to war , and if people want peace than they should sit down and talk about a compromise . Armenia isn't strong enough to exercise the 'we think we 're right , and we have the bombs , so we 'll do whatever we want , so there ... ' style of foreign relations . Yes you can type Stalin in caps , and give one sided atrocity stories etc . but for peace you need to be willing to talk to the other side . You personally can choose not to do that of course , this being just USENET . The people in power should n't be so childish . BM ] If you belong to the Armenian diaspora , keep in mind that what strikes BM ] your fancy on the map is costing the local Armenians dearly in terms of BM ] their blood and future . henrik ] Again , you are taking different TURNS . Armenia HAS no intension henrik ] to GRAB any LAND from Azerbaijan . The Armenians in KARABAKH henrik ] are simply defending themselves UNTIL a solution is SET . Azeri 's would disagree with you on this , and the maps I 've seen support what they 'd be saying . It does n't seem likely that a solution will be reached in this manner . BM ] It 's easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize BM ] craziness to have your feelings about Turks tickled . The Armenians BM ] in Armenia and N-K will be there , with the same people you seem to hate BM ] as their neighbors , for maybe 3000 years more . The sooner there 's peace in BM ] the region the better it is for them and everyone else . I 'd push for BM ] compromise if I were you instead of hitting the caps-lock and spreading BM ] inflammatory half-truths . henrik ] It is NOT up to me to decide the PEACE initiative . I am absolutely henrik ] for it . It did n't look it when I read your posting . It would seem to me that if you can spew mis-information about a boogey-man , you can also talk about how one might avoid the nastiness . Fair ? henrik ] But , in the meantime , if you do not take care of yourself , henrik ] you will be WIPED out . Such as the case in the era of 1915-20 of henrik ] The Armenian Massacres . You do n't realize I can say the same thing about 'The Turkish Massacres . ' Yes , boys and girls , let 's always talk about how bad and nasty things were . Let 's do that so we 're overwhelmed by anger , and let 's do that so our kids will also be hateful . Sounds crazy does n't it ? Do n't do it then . BM

I am using X11R4 and Motif 1.1 currently , although I will also be working with Open Look in the future . What I need to do is under certain circumstances prevent the user from switching from one window of the application to another window . Let 's say , for example , that Window A is on top of Window B in the window hierarchy . Normally , if the user clicks the mouse in Window B it will be brought to the top of the window hierarchy and placed on top of Window A . Under certain circumstances if the user clicks the mouse in Window B I need to beep and prevent Window B from being raised on top of Window A . From the research and testing I 've done so far , it appears that this window ordering is handled by the window manager , in this case Motif . I have n't found any way to override this default processing through standard X Window functions . I can tell when this switching occurs through focus change and mapping notify events , but I ca n't find any way to tell Motif not to make the switch . The temporary solution I 've currently come up with is very kludgy but it partially works . When I detect such a window switch in those cases when the switch is not allowed , I manually force the formerly top window back on top with an XRaiseWindow call and beep with the XBell function . This provides the necessary functionality but looks ugly when the windows switch places twice . Does anyone know how I can tell Motif ( or preferably *any* window manager ) when I do n't want the window order switch to actually take place ? Respond either by e-mail or posting to this newsgroup . Cheers ... .

The `` whole Russian strategy '' is not specific to Detroit or to Devellano , who was GM before Murray . What the previous GM also did was to trade away several players who have gone on to do well with other teams , most notably ( in my memory ) Murray Craven , who had a few very good years with Philly after leaving here . Also , it 's not the volume of trades that will necessarily improve a team , but the quality of them . Trading Adam Oates for Bernie Federko was just plain stupid , even if Federko used to be a great player at one time . Most of Murray 's trades have worked significantly to the Wings ' advantage , with those that did n't being soured mainly by injury to the players involved ( such as Troy Crowder , who suffered back problems from which he never really recovered ) . Put Scotty Bowman , Pat Burns , or any of the other better coaches in the league behind the bench of this Detroit team , and they could beat anybody . -- Randy

From : seth @ cbnewsh.cb.att.com ( peter.r.clark..jr ) Subject : FLYERS notes 4/16 Organization : AT & T Keywords : FLYERS/Sabres summary , misc stuff Lines : 283 The FLYERS blew a 3-0 lead over the Buffalo Sabres in the second period , but Kevin Dineen 's 7th career hat trick powered them to their 7th consecutive win , 7-4 over the Sabres who have now lost 7 in a row . Alexander Mogilny led the comeback scoring his 75th and 76th goals of the season which tied the game at 3 in the 2nd period and 4 in the 3rd . Tommy Soderstrom stopped 41 of 45 shots on goal to improve his own record to 20-17-6 as he was tested by Mogilny and LaFontaine all night . Roster move : Andre Faust was once again recalled from Hershey , Shawn Cronin was a healthy scratch . Lines : Eklund-Lindros-Recchi Beranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen Lomakin-Butsayev-Conroy Faust-Acton-Brown Galley-Bowen Yushkevich-Hawgood Carkner-McGill Tommy Soderstrom Game Summary : Say , if anybody from Buffalo is reading this , where did you people get that woman who sang the anthems ? We had to turn down the volume ! The FLYERS defense started out the game showing everybody why the FLYERS have been shutting teams out lately by holding the Sabres to only 8 shots in the first period . They then showed everybody why they will be playing golf Sunday when they gave up 37 shots in the last two periods . Maybe Tommy told them that he was getting bored back there ... Mark Recchi opened the scoring so fast that if you blinked you missed it . After Buffalo won the faceoff and dumped , Tommy wrapped the puck around the boards to Eric 1/2 way up on his left . Eric dropped it to Galley , and he sent it ahead to Recchi steaming out of the zone . Mark skated into the center circle , passed the puck to himself through the legs of Richard Smehlik , skated around him and in on Fuhr . Smehlik was pulling at him all the way through the zone with his stick , Recchi drifted right , drifted back left , and slid the puck back to the right past Fuhr for a 1-0 FLYERS lead at 0:18 . It was so beautiful Eric and Garry should turn down their assists : - ) . The FLYERS kept the pressure on Fuhr for a while after that , but he was strong and kept the FLYERS from doing further damage . The game then became a defensive struggle for a while . The Sabres got the first chance on the power play when Terry Carkner took a boarding minor at 10:26 for crunching Dale Hawerchuk into the boards in the FLYERS zone . LaFontaine got the only scoring chance , and not a terribly good one , as the FLYERS smothered the Sabres power play . Mogilny got a post after it was over . The 25th consecutive penalty kill for the FLYERS . Keith Carney took a holding penalty at 13:31 for taking down Mark Recchi to give the FLYERS a power play . The best penalty killing team in the league did n't allow the FLYERS a shot on goal , although the FLYERS did create a good scoring chance for Lindros who partially fanned on his shot . Towards the end of the period the play started going end to end , but everybody kept missing the net . Greg Hawgood took an interference penalty at 18:19 to give the Sabres another power play , but they could n't get anything going and the fans expressed their displeasure , particularly when they iced the puck . Shots were 8-6 Buffalo after the FLYERS had led 6-2 at one point . Mike Emrick interviewed FLYERS president Jay Snider between periods . Jay was disappointed to not make the playoffs , but not discouraged . This was considered a rebuilding year after *The Trade* and he seemed very happy with the way the season went . When asked if he agonized over *The Trade* he said that it was Russ Farwell 's trade and not his , that it only was an issue for him and Ed Snider as far as the money . But yes , there was some agonizing , and they 'd do it all over again . When asked how the coaching situation would be handled for next year he said that it 's Russ ' call , and Russ will evaluate things at the end of the season . He feels that they 're 3 years away from a shot at the Cup . He expects to get into the playoffs next year , have a shot at a division title the following year , and a shot at the finals the year after that . This based on the current level of play and anticipated improvements over the summer . He 's very happy with the re-alignment ( he called it `` outstanding '' ) . Happy with the current expansion , feels that the talent pool is big enough with the unflux of Europeans , but feels that they must make sure existing franchises are stable . Seemed to like the idea of playing in the Olympics ( booo ) but said that there was a definite split among owners and that this certainly would only happen in four years if there was a consensus . The Sabres gave the FLYERS their second power play of the game when Brad May took a tripping penalty at 0:51 of the second . The FLYERS had a little trouble getting started , but eventually did . Hawgood took a pass as he was moving throug the neutral zone and handed the puck to Eklund just outside the Sabres blue line along the right boards . Eklund carried into the zone nad passed across to Dineen who tried a one timer from between the blue line and the top of the left circle . He half fanned on it , and sent the puck trickling through the slot . Fuhr did n't know where it was , though , and Hawgood won the race to it and flipped it into essentially an open net at 2:15 . Then Mogilny on a breakaway . He slipped through two FLYERS at the blue line and went in on Soderstrom . He went with the backhander , but Soderstrom was all over it . The FLYERS then took some bad discipline type penalties that really hurt them . Viacheslav Butsayev took a double minor for roughing and high sticking when Barnaby got under his skin and drew one minor , then according to Gary Dornhoefer took a dive to get the other ( there was no video ) at 4:22 . The Sabres coudln't get started . Ryan McGill poked at the puck just after a Sabre carried into the FLYERS zone , and after a bunch of people poked at it Dineen emerged with it and headed the other way . It started out a 1 on 1 , but Brind'Amour hustled ahead to make it a 2 on 1 and back off the defenseman . Dineen let it rip from the top of the right circle to make it 3-0 FLYERS at 5:40 . That was all for Fuhr , John Muckler sent in Dominik Hasek to take over . But the Sabres still had lots of power play time . Again they took some time to just get into the FLYERS zone , and when they finally did the FLYERS were all over them . Boos began to ring through the building . But they finally got through Soderstrom on an ugly goal . Smehlik took a shot from the top of the zone that missed and kicked out to Hawerchuk in the slot . Hawerchuk tried a backhander as he skated towards the goal line to the right as Galley dove down to block it . Mistake # 1 , he should have let Soderstrom handle the backhander and worried about A ) the rebound or B ) Barnaby who was camped behind the goal line right next to the net . Well , the rebound dropped right next to Soderstrom , and mistake # 2 , Galley just laid there and watched Barnaby get THREE hacks at the puck before he finally pushed it through the goalie . He did n't even swing his stick out to try and knock the puck away . With the goal , at 7:48 , two streaks end for the FLYERS . 150:28 of shutout hockey , and 27 straight penalty kills . Lindros put them right back on the power play at 8:36 with a high sticking minor , I think it was Barnaby again . This time the Sabres were able to get set up quickly , but could n't get too much quality on goal . The Sabres continued to keep the puck in the FLYERS end for a while after the power play ended . Things evetually settled down , but then the other very bad penalty . McGill allowed Barnaby to get under his skin and slashed his stick just before a faceoff . The gloves were dropped , and McGill started pounding the crap out of him . But during the fight , he gave Barnaby a head butt with his helmet , and that meant a match penalty . 2 for slashing , 5 fighting and 5 for the major , 7 minutes of power play time for the Sabres at 14:15 , Barnaby only got 5 . The FLYERS were keeping them at bay for a while , but there was only so long they could do that . After a couple of good Sabre chances , Audette handed to Ledyard at the point , and Ledyard sent a drive that was knocked down by Soderstrom . LaFontaine whacked at the bouncing puck from the left side of the net , and knocked it over to Randy Wood at the right . Soderstrom had moved over to play LaFontaine , and since Yushkevich and Carkner were waving at the puck instead of picking up men , Wood just slid it into the empty net at 17:34 to close the FLYERS lead to 3-2 . LaFontaine was actually trying to put it on net , but half fanned on it and got a break . The FLYERS then got some shorthanded pressure in the Sabres zone , but Hasek was strong . Finally it was Keith Carney passing ahead to Hawerchuk into the neutral zone , and Hawerchuk sent a good backhand pass to Mogilny at the FLYERS blue line . Another mini-breakaway for Mogilny , he elected to shoot from the left circle , and he threaded the needle to get it just inside the far post at 18:56 for his 75th of the season . Ironically , the youth hockey tip between the 1st and second period was Tommy Soderstrom talking about cutting off angles ... That was all in the 2nd , shots were 19-7 Sabres . Into the 3rd period , and Pelle EKlund blew a golden opportunity to get the FLYERS the lead back . A 2 on 1 , Acton with the puck , he dropped to Eklund in the slot , and Eklund held the puck as he slid through the left circle until he had almost no angle at all to shoot from . When he finally did shoot , he hit the far post . That was still during the carryover power play time . Than an incredible almost goal . Randy Wood skated around Recchi and Hawgood untouched into Soderstrom . Soderstrom goes down , Wood pokes the puck under Soderstrom , and a black object hits the back of the net . Red light comes on , horn sounds , crowd cheers . But up to the video replay booth , for some strange reason , and in the meantime Emrick and Dornhoefer try to figure out what they could be reviewing . Well , it turns out that it was the taped up stick blade that went into the net , not the puck . Emrick mentions that one of the criteria for scoring a goal is that the puck must go into the net ... Dave Hannan then took out Recchi and got a holding minor at 2:35 . The FLYERS could not get anything going at all . They finally got set up 1/2 way through , but were kept on the perimeter . As time ran out , Beranek stripped the puck from a Sabre in the offensive zone along the right boards and passed it across to Eklund at the top of the left circle . Eklund saw Dineen heading at the net just inside the right circle and passed through to him . Dineen fumbled the pass , but twice directed it at Hasek , and Eklund swooped in and chipped the bouncing puck over the goalie for his 11th at 4:42 . 4-3 FLYERS . But the Sabres came right back . LaFontaine picked up the puck in his offensive left corner and slid it to Bob Erry behind the FLYERS net . Erry started to skate out , but then just dropped the puck back to nobody behind the net . Mogilny flew in , skated around , and stuffed it through Soderstrom 's 5 hole for his 76th at 5:24 to tie the game at 4 . Then Hawerchuk took a retaliatory roughing penalty at 5:55 . The FLYERS set up in the Sabres zone , and stayed there . Off a faceoff high in the Sabres zone in the middle . While Brind'Amour wrestled for the puck , Dineen snuck through the line and wristed a perfect shot low to Hasek 's glove side at 6:44 . Play started to go back and forth until Hawgood took a roughing penalty at 8:19 . The FLYERS dumped the puck into the Sabres zone . Brind'Amour and Ledyard went after it , and Rod got the puck . He backed away from the right boards , skated to the right faceoff dot , and passed between his legs to Dineen crashing through the slot all by himself . Dineen waited patiently and lifted it over the blocker of Hasek for a 6-4 FLYERS lead at 8:39 . 3rd hat trick of the season for Dineen , 7th of his career , 2nd shorthanded goal of the game for him 35th of the season . Then Carney took a tripping penalty at 9:02 to kill the rest of the Sabres power play . Not much action on the 4 on 4 , and the Sabres got most of the chances on the FLYERS resulting power play . Play went end to end for quite a while after that and both goalies had to make some big saves . The Sabres were n't able to pull Hasek as time was running out as the FLYERS would n't allow any consistant possession for the Sabres . Finally as time was running out Ken Sutton misplayed the puck in his own left corner and Brind'Amour stripped it away from him . He pulled away and found Dineen on the other side of the left circle , and Dineen found Acton at the right of Hasek . He slid the puck between two Sabres defenders , and Acton chipped it back to the far side of Hasek for his 8th of the season at 19:48 on his 35th birthday . That was all the scoring , shots were 18-13 Buffalo , and the ice was showered with plastic drinking mugs handed out before the game . So another strong game from Tommy Soderstrom who had n't been tested much in his last couple of starts . Kevin Dineen has a career high 6 point night ( unless he had a better night earlier in the season , but I do n't think so ) . The FLYERS longest winning streak in 3 years , 30 goals for only 11 against with three shutouts . Eric Lindros is 8th in league with 33 even strength goals despite missing 23 games with injury . 4 points out of 4th , clinched 5th place since the Rangers lose the tie breaker . A couple misc notes : Forget the Mike Keenan rumors , there will be a press conference tommorrow to announce that he will be head coach of the New York Rangers next year . In the last notes I mentioned that Garry Galley won the Barry Ashbee Award , but I failed to mention that the award is for the best defenseman . The Times of Trenton has reported that `` a preeminent specialist from Oklahoma '' has looked over Tommy Soderstrom 's medical record and determined that no further tests are necessary in the near future . Same paper had a blurb about Bill Dineen being asked about whether or not he expected to be back next year . His response was that he wants to come back , he feels he did a good job this year , but that he would cheerfully accept a role scouting if Farwell did n't want him back .

Well , first you work out how much cold gas you need , then make the tanks big enough . Our sounding rocket payload , with telemetry , guidance , etc . etc . and a telescope cluster , weighs around 1100 pounds . It uses freon jets for steering and a pulse-width-modulated controller for alignment ( ie during our eight minutes in space , the jets are pretty much continuously firing on a ~10 % duty cycle or so ... ) . The jets also need to kill residual angular momentum from the spin stabilization , and flip the payload around to look at the Sun . We have two freon tanks , each holding ~5 liters of freon ( I 'm speaking only from memory of the last flight ) . The ground crew at WSMR choose how much freon to use based on some black-magic algorithm . They have extra tank modules that just bolt into the payload stack . This should give you an idea of the order of magnitude for cold gas quantity . If you really need to know , send me email and I 'll try to get you in touch with our ground crew people .

It is the same price as the stealth card . Plus it is also based on S3 928 chip the newest and fastest chip from s3 . Everyone , if you are looking for a card , SEE THE APRIL ISSUE OF PC MAGAZINE FOR THEIR REVIEW . They noted this person 's problem with dos . The stealth card is not a very good dos performer . The Actix card is rated the best in this chip class ( non local bus ) . It got glowing reports from the magazine ( was a best buy ) and I called them directly and they just updated their windows drivers last week ! They have a bulletin board to get the latest drivers . Though somone posted that this bbs was at 2400 . AT any rate , the Actix graphics engine ultra outperforms all the other cards in the 928 class ( based on the winmark results ) . If you are looking for the all around best dos/windows performance check out the actix card . Their 1-800 number is 927-5557 . P.S . The article in pc magazine noted that if you are a regular dos user ( ie : games ) then you should also check out the 801 chip from s3 . It apparently scores just as well and in many cases slightly better in dos than the 928 chip ( ie : stealth and actix cards . ) They have `` comparable '' windows performance and are cheaper to buy .

From : romdas @ uclink.berkeley.edu ( Ella I Baff ) Subject : GETTING AIDS FROM ACUPUNCTURE NEEDLES Organization : University of California , Berkeley Lines : 44 Distribution : world NNTP-Posting-Host : uclink.berkeley.edu someone wrote in expressing concern about getting AIDS from acupuncture needles ... .. Unless your friend is sharing fluids with their acupuncturist who themselves has AIDS..it is unlikely ( not impossible ) they will get AIDS from acupuncture needles . Generally , even if accidently inoculated , the normal immune response should be enough to effectively handle the minimal contaminant involved with acupuncture needle insertion . Most acupuncturists use disposable needles ... use once and throw away . They do this because you are not the only one concerned about transmission of diseases via this route ... so it 's good business to advertise `` disposable needlesused here . '' These needles tend to be of a lower quality however , being poorly manufactured and too `` sharp '' in my opinion . They tend to snag bloodvessels on insertion compared to higher quality needles . If I choose to use acupuncture for a given complaint , that patient will get their own set of new needles which are sterilized between treatments . The risk here for hepatitis , HIV , etc . transmission is that I could mistakenly use an infected persons needles accidently on the wrong patient ... but clear labelling and paying attention all but eliminates this risk . Better quality needles tend to `` slide '' past vessels and nerves avoiding unpleasant painful snags..and hematomas ... so I use them . Acupuncture needles come in many lengths and thicknesses ... but they are all solid when compared to their injection-style cousins . In China , herbal solutionsand western pharmaceuticals are occasionally injected into meridian points purported to have TCM physiologic effects and so require the same hollow needles used for injecting fluid medicine . This means ... thinkingtiny ... that a samll amount of tissue , the diameter of the needle bore , will be injected into the body as it would be in a typical `` shot . '' when the skin is puntured . On the other hand when the solid acupuncture needle is inserted , the skin tends to `` squeeze '' the needle from the tip to the level of insertion such that any 'cooties ' that have n't been schmeared away with alcohol before insertion , tend to remain on the surface of the skin minimizing invasion from the exterior . Of course in TCM ... the body 's exterior is protected by the Wei ( Protective ) Qi..so infection is unlikely ... .or in other words ... there is a normal inflammatory and immune response that accompanies tissue damage incurred at the puncture site . While I 'm fairly certain your friend will not have a transferable disease transmitted to them via acupuncture needle insertion , I would like to know for what complaint they have consulted the acupuncturist ... not to know if it would be harmful.. but to know if it would be helpful .

This is > not true for the Spectral Innovations boards , for example . To boorishly reply to myself , I found I did have the Instrutech information already . The specs ( to use the term loosely ) are as follows : A/D : 16 bit converter , with 14 bit accuracy to 100 kHz , 12 bit accuracy to 200 kHz . No specs for S/N , monotonicity , linearity . There are 8 multiplexed inputs sharing the single A/D , so that all inputs are not samples at the same time , and in the above conversion specs the all-channel sample rate must be used . Thus , for two channels , you only have 14 unknown quality bits at 50 kHz per channel . This is poorer quality than the national Instruments , at the same sample rate . D/A : 16 bit converter . No specs for S/N , monotonicity , linearity . Each of the 4 output channels has its own converter . The price for the external converter box ( the ITC-16 ) , the NuBus interface board ( the MAC-23 ) , plus C driver software and Igor XOP 's is $ 2695 . Rather steep .

The point is that any eugenic solution to the Jewish Problem as Elias has proposed smacks of pure Nazism . The fact that Elias ' proposal cast the entire `` problem '' as one of the abnormal presence of Israeli society in the Middle East , and that he buried a slam against U.S. aid to Israel in the midst of his `` even-handed '' solution of the Jewish Question , made it obvious what he had in mind : disolving the Jewish polity . That *is* a Nazi doctrine : rectification of the `` abnormal presence '' of the Jewish people within a larger body politic . Whether your `` solution '' involves gas , monetary incentives to the poor Jews to marry out , or as Feisal Husseini has said , `` disolve the Zionist entity by forcing it to engage the normal surrounding Arab culture , '' you are engaged in a Nazi project . Just as obvious is your statement : `` I will not comment on the value or lack of value of Elias 's proposal . '' Still striking the glancing blow , right Brendan ?

I 've typed it in verbatim , for you folks to chew over . Many of the topics recently discussed on sci.space are covered in this . Gibbons Outlines Space Station Redesign Guidance Dr. John H. Gibbons , Director , Office of Science and Technology Policy , outlined to the members-designate of the Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space Station on April 3 , three budget options as guidance to the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of the space station . A low option of $ 5 billion , a mid-range option of $ 7 billion and a high option of $ 9 billion will be considered by the committee . Each option would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscal year 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for development , operations , utilization , Shuttle integration , facilities , research operations support , transition cost and also must include adequate program reserves to insure program implementation within the available funds . Over the next 5 years , $ 4 billion is reserved within the NASA budget for the President 's new technology investment . As a result , station options above $ 7 billion must be accompanied by offsetting reductions in the rest of the NASA budget . For example , a space station option of $ 9 billion would require $ 2 billion in offsets from the NASA budget over the next 5 years . Gibbons presented the information at an organizational session of the advisory committee . Generally , the members-designate focused upon administrative topics and used the session to get acquainted . They also received a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process the Station Redesign Team is following to develop options for the advisory committee to consider . Gibbons also announced that the United States and its international partners -- the Europeans , Japanese , and Canadians -- have decided , after consultation , to give '' full consideration '' to use of Russian assets in the course of the space station redesign process . To that end , the Russians will be asked to participate in the redesign effort on an as-needed consulting basis , so that the redesign team can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR and the possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and systems . The U.S. and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise of the Russian participants in assessing Russian systems and technology . The overall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducing station costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilities . Careful integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in achieving that goal . Gibbons reiterated that , `` President Clinton is committed to the redesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve the science , the technology and the jobs that the space station program represents . However , he also is committed to a space station that is well managed and one that does not consume the national resources which should be used to invest in the future of this industry and this nation . '' NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin said the Russian participation will be accomplished through the East- West Space Science Center at the University of Maryland under the leadership of Roald Sagdeev .

I donot know why there are israeli voices against negotiations . However , i would guess that is because they refuse giving back a land for those who have the right for it . As for the Arabian and Palestinean voices that are against the current negotiations and the so-called peace process , they are not against peace per se , but rather for their well-founded predictions that Israel would NOT give an inch of the West bank ( and most probably the same for Golan Heights ) back to the Arabs . An 18 months of `` negotiations '' in Madrid , and Washington proved these predictions . Now many will jump on me saying why are you blaming israelis for no-result negotiations . I would say why would the Arabs stall the negotiations , what do they have to loose ? Arabs feel that the current `` negotiations '' is ONLY for legitimizing the current status-quo and for opening the doors of the Arab markets for israeli trade and '' oranges '' . That is simply unacceptable and would be revoked . Just an opinion . Hasan

Hi Janet , Sounds exactly like mine . Same circumstance , same onset symptoms , same cafergot uselessness , same duration . In fact , of all the people I know who have migraines , none have been so similar . There is such a wide variation between people with respect to what causes their headaches , that I generally do n't bother sharing what I 've learned about mine , but since ours seem to be alike , here are my observations . I do n't think it 's heat , per se ( I 've had more in winter than summer ) . Dehydration could conceivably figure , though . Try tanking up before playing rather than after . Being in shape does n't seem to help me much , either . I 've identified four factors that do make a difference ( listed in descending order of importance ) : 1 ) Heavy exercise 2 ) Sleep deprivation 3 ) Fasting ( e.g. , skipped breakfast ) 4 ) Physical trauma ( e.g. , head bonk ) Heavy exercise has preceded all of my post-adolescent migraines , but I do n't get migraines after every heavy exercise session . One or more of the other factors *must* be present ( usually # 2 ) . Since I discovered this , I 've been nearly migraine-free -- relapsing only once every two or three years when I get cocky ( `` It 's been so long , maybe I just do n't get them anymore '' ) and stop being careful .

I do n't understand the assumption that because something is found to be carcinogenic that `` it would not be legal in the U.S. '' . I think that naturally occuring substances ( excluding `` controlled '' substances ) are pretty much unregulated in terms of their use as food , food additives or other `` consumption '' . It 's only when the chemists concoct ( sp ? ) an ingredient that it falls under FDA regulations . Otherwise , if they really looked closely they would find a reason to ban almost everything . How in the world do you suppose it 's legal to `` consume '' tobacco products ( which probably SHOULD be banned ) ? Dave Allen Space Science & Engr . Ctr . UW-Madison

Wishful thinking mostly . It 's more likely that the Moon will never be the site of major commercial activity . As far as we know it has no materials we ca n't get cheaper right here on Earth or from asteroids and comets , aside from the semi-mythic He3 that *might* be useful in low grade fusion reactors . Exploring it would satisfy a curiosity itch , and it 's position in the gravity well of Earth coupled with it 's heat sink capacity could offer some military utility for `` high ground '' military weapons systems , but it holds very minute commercial value . If space travel becomes cheap enough , it might become a tourist attraction as Mt . Everest and the Antarctic have become , but that 's a very minor activity in the global scope of things . Luna has an inconvienent gravity field . It 's likely too low to prevent calcium loss , muscle atrophy , and long term genetic drift . Yet it's too high to do micro-G manufacturing . Space based colonies and factories that can be spun to any convienent value of G look much better . Luna has a modest vacuum and raw solar exposure two weeks a month , but orbital sites can have better vacuums and continous solar exposure . Luna offers a source of light element rocks that can serve as raw materials , heatsink , and shielding . The asteroids and comets offer sources of both light and heavy elements , and volatile compounds , and many are in less steep gravity wells so that less delta-v is required to reach them . We do n't use 2/3rds of the Earth now , the seafloors , and we virtually ignore Antarctica , a whole continent . That 's because we do n't have to deal with those conditions in order to make a buck . Luna is a much more expensive place to visit , or to live and work . I think we 'll use the easier places first . That pushes Lunar development back at least a few centuries , if not much longer . Luna 's main short term value would be as a place for a farside radio astronomy observatory , shielded from the noisy Earth . Or as the site of a laser , particle beam , or linear accelerator weapons system for defending Earth , or bombarding it as the case may be . The first is unlikely because of the high cost for such a basic science instrument . The second is just as unlikely because conventional nukes are good enough , and the military would really rather see the Earth safe for conventional warfare again . There 's little glory in watching from a bunker as machines fight each other over continental ranges . Little ultimate profit either .

On 19.3.93 my wife went to her General Practitioner ( Doctor ) . He mentioned an article from a medical journal that is of great interest to us . He had read it in the previous three months but has been unable to find it again . The article was about Whiplash Injury/Cervical Pain . It mentions the use of a MRI ( Magnetic Resonance Imagery ) machine as a diagnostic tool and the work of a neurosurgeon who relived cervical pain . This article is most likely in an Australian medical journal . I very much want to obtain the name of the article , journal and author because the case matches my wife . We would very much appreciate anyone 's help in this matter via email preferably . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Gavin Anderson email : GAnderson @ cmutual.com.au Analyst/Programmer . phone : +61-3-607-6299 Colonial Mutual Life Aust .

Frankly , the Saturn way of doing business and service was a *very* big plus . I had n't bought a new car since I bought my Honda 4WD back in '85 , and I was unbelieveably offended by most salespeople I met . Saturn was indeed very different . I made three different visits to the dealer where I bought my car , and was never pressured . Saturn also had the best after-sales support , and the fixed pricing made it *very* easy for me to decide exactly what I wanted to buy . Another big selling point was running into my mechanic at the dealer . He 's been fixing imports for 20 years ... and bought a Saturn , based on what he 's seen and heard from his customers . Saturn also has a good extended warranty program ; $ 675 for 6 year/60K miles , fully refunded if you do n't use it . That works out to an actual cost of $ 170 or so , based on the 6 year treasury rates . Using savings account rates it 's more like $ 120 . In the first three years it also buys you free rental during any warranty work , without counting against the refund . -- mike

Neck-reining steers a horse by holding the reins together in one hand , and pulling against the horse 's neck in the direction you wish to go . When training a plow-steering horse to neck-rein , one technique is to cross the reins under his necks .

Distribution : na Lines : 37 The stragegy of the government is interesting . The real fear comes from them doing more than this . This is a voluntary program , and thus harder for us to object to on the surface . Their strategy is a business one rather than legal one . They are pushing to get a standard in place , a secret standard , and if they get it as a standard then they will drive competitors out of the market . It will be legal to sell better , untapable encryption that does n't have registered keys , but it will be difficult , and thus not a plan for most phone companies . You see , with clipper chip phones you 'll be able to talk to any cellular company , or other phones or ports because they will follow the standard . AT & T has already announced a clipper chip encryption product . The government has marketed hard to get major vendors to use these chips . If they get enough market share , they will rule . And thus there will be very little market for systems that ca n't be tapped by the police . The public is n't that concerned about it now , after all . They freely do calls that anybody with an old TV can listen to today ! They wo n't pay big extra bucks for proprietary phones that secure them only from the police . Well , some people will buy these phones , but they will only work with other proprietary phones , so the market will be small and the phones expensive . Unless they are made in numbers large enough to sell them cheap , only the Mob will buy them . And this means that the FBI will want to track the customer lists of better encryption phones , because `` the only reason a person would want one is to evade the police .

'' -- Keith Keller , 1993 You obviously do n't understand how TV scheduling works . ESPN had prior contracts to baseball to show Monday night games and had contracted all the other bs shows well in advance . The NHL TV deal was very late in the scheduling process ( you normally have to do this one-plus year out . The NHL package was finished two weeks before the season started ) . ESPN has shown tremendous commitment to the NHL by squeezing in extra telecasts when it could ( like the last Minnesota game ) and putting Stanley Cup games as backup to their baseball telecasts ( which by favorable circumstances they could pull off last night ) . But the bottom line is that ESPN can not break contracts at will . They must honor the previous deals they made . $ $ $ $ _does_ have something to do with it , especially if you risk a $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ lawsuit for breach of contract with baseball . So relax .

There 's another point to be made . Those who have been inside burning houses know that if they want to stay alive , it 's better to run out from the building . We had one case where an FBI agent *had to drag out a women* from the burning house , she run back in when she saw the forces arriving .

This suggestion is n't as far-fetched as it sounds . Years ago in another time and place , I used to do oil changes in boats powered by automotive engines . In many cases , there was no way to get any sort of a tray under the oil pan because it was boxed in by the bottom of the hull and various floation chambers on each side . And if you *did* get something there , you'd spill all the oil out of it for sure trying to get it back out again . So we used a small pump powered by an electric drill to suck the oil out the dipstick hole . There was a long/thin hose on the inlet side designed to fit down the dipstick tube , and another , thicker/shorter hose on the outlet side that you put into any convenient container . I 'm sure these gadgets are still available from marine hardware suppliers if you want one . Mart L.

I am also of the opinion that salvation is by faith alone , based on Ephesians 2 and Romans 3:21-31 . I also conclude that James 2 , when read in context , is teaching bullet ( 2 ) above . When James speaks of justification , I would claim that he is not speaking of God declaring the believing sinner innocent in His sight ( Paul 's use of the word ) . Instead he is speaking of the sinner 's profession of faith being '' justified '' or `` proven '' by the display of good works . Also according to James 2 , the abscence of such works is evidence for a `` dead '' or '' useless '' faith which fails to save . James 2 is not a problem for the doctrine of salvation by faith if it is teaching ( 2 ) . Works would have their place , not as merit toward salvation , but as evidence of true faith .

From : halsall @ murray.fordham.edu ( Paul Halsall ) Subject : Weirdness of Early Christians Reply-To : halsall @ murray.fordham.edu Organization : J . Random Misconfigured Site Lines : 76 I am a good Catholic boy . A convert no less , attracted by the rational tradition [ Aquinas et al ] and the emotional authenticity [ in comp . with the faddishness of Anglicanism ] to Roman Catholicism . I never had much time for the pope - or any other heirarchs - but I did , and do , believe in the sacremental system . I always felt quite happy to look down my nose at those such as John Emery [ a few posts back ] who had to engage in circuitous textual arguments to prove their faith , entirely oblivious to the fact that a dozen other faiths can do the same [ with miracles too ] , and that since their arguments depend on the belief in the Bible as God 's sole revelation , it was not very good logic to argue that the Bible proved God . No , I was happy to accept the CHURCH as God's revelation . It was the Church after all that existed before the Bible , the Church that choose [ under grace of course ] the canon of scripture . Protestant ludicrosity , I thought , was shown by Protestants breathtaking acceptance of Luther 's right to reject a dozen or so books he disliked . But recently I read Peter Brown 's _Body and Society_ . It is very well researched , and well written . But is raises some very upsetting questions . The early Christians were weird - even more so than today's carzy fundies . They had odd views on sex , odder views on the body , totally ludicrous views about demons , and distinctly uncharitable views about other human beings . now the question is this : were the first Christians just as weird , but we 've got used to them , or did the pristine `` Fall of the Church '' happen within one generation . It certainly did'nt have to wait until the Triumph of the Church under Constantine . If so , wha does this say about God 's promise to always support the Church . It 's no use throwing the usual Protestant pieties about the Church not being an organization at me . It 's a community or it is nothing , and it was the early communities that were weird . The institional church was a model of sanity by comparison . I would be interested in serious Catholic and Orthodox responses to this entirely serious issue . I 'm not sure it is an issue for Protestants with their `` soul alone with Jesus '' approach , but for we who see the '' ecclesia '' as a `` koinoia '' over time and space , the weird early Christians are a problem . [ This is an exaggeration of the Protestant view . Many Protestants have a strong appreciation for the role of the Church . `` The soul alone with God '' is certainly important for Protestants , but it 's by no means the whole story . I have read the sort of history you talk about . As you point out , Protestants do n't have quite the same problem you do , because we believe that the church had a Fall at some point . However Protestant mythology typically places the Fall around the time of Constantine ( or more likely , regard it as happening in a sort of cumulative fashion , starting from Constantine but getting worse as the Pope accumulated power during the medieval period . ) The consequences of having it earlier are somewhat worrisome even to us . Most Protestants accept the theological results of the early ecumenical councils , including such items as the Trinity and Incarnation . Indeed in the works of Reformers such as Luther and Calvin , you 'll find Church Fathers such as Augustine quoted all the time . I think you 'll find many Protestants resistant to the idea that the Early Church as a whole was '' wierd '' . ( There is an additional problem for Protestants that I don't much want to talk about in this context , since it 's been looked at recently -- that 's the question of whether one can really think of Augustine and other Fathers as being proto-Protestants . Their views on Mary , the authority of the Pope , etc , are not entirely congenial to Protestant thought . ) One thing that somewhat worries me is a question of methodology . There are certainly plenty of wierd people in the early church . What concerns me is that they may be overrepresented in what we see . We see every Christian who courted martyrdom . But I think there 's good reason to believe that most ordinary Christians were more prudent than that . We see the heroic virgins . But I think there 's good reason to think that many Christians were happily married . I ca n't help suspecting that the early church had the same range of wierdos and sane people that we do now . I think there 's also a certain level of '' revisionism '' active in history at the moment . I do n't mean that they 're manufacturing things out of whole cloth . But do n't you think there might be a tendency to emphasize the novel ? -- clh ]

It was apparently made with a hand held camcorder ( the quality was terrible , and the camera was really jumpy ) . The documentary ( sic ) told the tales of all of the children who died in the `` war '' against the Jews as martyrs . It was a regular sob story . One `` victimized youth '' was recounting on how all he `` really '' wants to do is to get an education and that the big bad Jews wo n't let him go to high school . He admittedly spent 4 years in prison ( age 13 to 17 ) for murdering a Jewish woman but claims that it was `` for the cause . '' I have seen this kind of garbage before . I have a lot of sympathy for the Palestinian cause ( as do many Jews ) , but I think that even many Arabs would be ashamed to call this a documentary ! The most suprising part is that the only credits shown at the end was an address for the makers of the film named JEWISH COMM . ON THE MIDDLE EAST . Anybody heard of them ? They make Peace Now look like right-wingers . Gedaliah Friedenberg -=-Department of Mechanical Engineering -=-Department of Metallurgy , Mechanics and Materials Science -=-Michigan State University

Although I certainly agree with the basic sentiment that snideness is unloving and ineffective , I 'm a little disturbed by the formulation that ill temper is not a Christian trait . It seems like a false argument to say that anyone who displays trait X must not be a Christian . Could well be a sinning Christian , but a Christian nonetheless . Anger is human , and Christians are human : Christians get angry and defensive and react badly just like everyone else . It 's not perfect righteousness but the effort of seeking righteousness that marks a dedicated Christian . And one of the greatest gifts of faith to me is that of seeking and accepting forgiveness for my failures . Expecting flawless behavior from self or others isn't Christianity : it 's perfectionism .

( was Re : My Gun is like my American Express Card ) Organization : Boeing Commercial Airplane Group Lines : 96 / iftccu : talk.politics.guns / mikey @ ccwf.cc.utexas.edu ( Strider ) / 8:51 pm Apr 12 , 1993 / > I think most of us would rather be held up with a knife than with a gun , > but HOW THE HELL ARE YOU GOING TO MANAGE THAT ? You still have n't offered I 've been watching this knife verses gun bit for a while now , ( even contributed a few comments ) but this stuff `` I 'd rather face a knife than a gun '' has GOT to come from ignorance ! I used to think pretty much the same thing , then I got 'educated . ' People do not as a rule understand how deadly knives can be , or how quickly you can be killed with one . Most people do n't understand that it takes less than an inch of penetration in some areas to cause quick ( within a minute or so ) death . The death rates from handguns and knives are within a few percentage points of each other . Many people not realizing how deadly knives are 'try their luck ' and thus more get injured by knives . A gun is deadly only in a single direction and it 's only advantage is that it is a remote control weapon . A contact weapon such as a knife controls a spherical area 7 to 10 feet in diameter . Most people have never seen knife wounds , aside from slicing a finger by accident . From 21 feet or so , a knife is very nearly an even match for a holstered gun in experienced hands , even if the knife wielder has only moderate skill . From inside 10 feet or so , a knife is a match for a DRAWN gun . A knife is utterly silent , it never jams and never runs out of ammunition . It is limited only by the speed , dexterity skill and ability of it 's wielder . Criminals in general are young , fast and strong . It 's interesting to note that the patterned slashing attacks used by many martial artists remarkably resemble the wild uncontrolled slashing attacks of novices . I 've talked to several well trained martial artists . They have unanimously agreed that if they ever go up against a knife they simply plan on being cut , hopefully not as bad as the attacker . Practicing with firearms requires facilities and equipment . Practicing with knives requires only a small area and something to simulate a knife , say a popsicle stick or tooth brush . Criminals practice their knife attacks in prison . If you have not trained against knives with a firearm and do not realize these facts the first inkling you will have that something is wrong is the knife ripping through your throat , or in the case of an experienced attacker , parts of your body falling off onto the ground . A 60 year old man with arthritis can close that 7 yard distance and gut you in about one and a half seconds . Dennis Tueller with a broken leg in a walking cast managed it in two . I 've seen people close that distance and strike in 1 second . I 'm old , over weight and slow . I can do it in 1.3 seconds . I 've seen morgue footage of people killed with edged weapons that you would not believe . ( How about a single stab wound to the chest with a TABLE FORK ! In this case the attacker used the HANDLE , not the pointed end . ) Add to this the 'fact ' that hand gun 'stopping ' power is largely a myth . Except in the case of a central nervous system shot , or a round that destroys the skeletal structure , it takes anywhere from 3 to twelve seconds for a bullet wound to 'take effect . ' This is true of even heart shots . There is the case of the police woman in L.A. , the first recorded survivor of a .357 shot to the heart . That lady not only killed her attacker , but chased him down to do it ! All four of her shots , fired after SHE had been shot , struck the perp . Atta girl ! The bullet entered her on a downward angle , went through the apex of her heart , down through the diaphragm , clipped her liver and destroyed her spleen . It then exited her back leaving a tennis ball sized hole . She died about six times on the operating table , but was out of the hospital in 15 days and was back on full duty in eight months ! She was off duty at the time and not wearing her vest . She was on her way home so happened to have her gun . No , she does n't think civilians should have the same rights . Sigh . The moral of the story is that even if you DO manage to shoot a knife attacker , you 'd better be planning on doing some dodging . A good alternative is to shoot for and break the pelvis . People can often walk ( a little ) on broken legs but a broken pelvis will nearly always anchor them . Many firearms schools recommend pelvis shots against contact weapons . The target is as large as the traditional 'center of mass ' and is more reliable to STOP somebody with a contact weapon , assuming a caliber powerful enough to 'do the job . ' Hot .38 's on up will usually do this . Remember folks , the idea is n't to 'take em with you ' but for you to live and them to fail , whatever the consequences for them . This the reason 'killing them ' is n't our goal , or in many cases even good enough to keep us alive . I do n't want to face a violent attack of any sort . Knowing what I now know , I ca n't rightly say I 'd rather face a knife than an gun . It would have to depend on the attacker , and if I could pick and choose , I WOULD N'T BE THERE . This is really the bottom line . Criminals do not fear the law . Criminals do not fear the weapon . They fear the citizen behind the weapon that has shown the resolution and determination to do whatever it takes . Rick .
