But Deborah says ( Judges 5:24 ) : > Blessed among women shall be Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite , > Blessed above all women in the tents . It can doubtless be taken that Jael 's slaying of Sisera was a type of Mary 's victory over sin . But even if we take Deborah 's words as applying prophetically or symbolically to Mary , they must still be applicable literally to Jael . We may well take them to mean that God used her as a part of His plan for the deliverance of His people , and that she has this in common with Mary . But we have no reason to suppose that they mean that she was sinless , and thus no reason to take the like expression applied to Mary as proof that she was sinless . Yours , James Kiefer

From : torsina @ enuxhb.eas.asu.edu ( Who ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ) Subject : Islam = Satanic ? ? ? Organization : Arizona State University Lines : 80 Dear fellow Christians , I had a dinner last night with a bible study group which I am in . We had a discussion about the difference between Christianity and Islam . And I was shocked to hear that our bible study teacher said that Mohammad was indeed a prophet but of Satan . I said , `` What ? ? '' I did not believe that , because I have some moslem friends who are so kind and nice , even sometimes I feel I wish I could be like them ( in my point of view , they do n't sin as much as I do ) . How come if they were under Satan , they could have such personalities . To tell you the truth , I do n't know much about Islam . But I know that they believe in God , they believe in the day of judgement . Now I 'm asking you what your opinions about Islam and its teaching . IMPORTANT : I do not want to discuss whether they are saved or not . I do not want to discuss about politic related to Islam . P.S : I post this in bit.listserv.christia , soc.religion.christian , and bit.listserv.catholic . In Christ , our Lord , Smile ... ... ... Jesus loves you ... ... . Tabut Torsina TORSINA @ ENUXHB.EAS.ASU.EDU [ Let me start by saying that this is not the right newsgroup for a discussion of Islam , since there 's a group for that . But I suspect the point your teacher was making was not specifically about Islam . Indeed it 's going to be impossible to see what he was getting at within your groundrules , since the question of whether non-Christians are saved is at the heart of it . The classic Christian view , which I think most people believed until the last century or so , was that Christianity ( and of course Judaism ) was the only religion founded by God , and that all other religions worshipped false gods , and came from Satan . This is more or less a corollary of another traditional view that no one but Christians ( and possibly Jews ) will be saved . This need not mean that there 's no truth in any other religion , nor that all of their members are intentionally Satanic . After all , in order to be an effective snare , Satanic alternatives would have to be attractive . Thus they might contain all kinds of truth , wisdom and spiritual insights . They would be missing only one thing -- knowledge of salvation through Christ . If this is the background of your teacher 's remarks -- and I suspect it is -- that means that a discussion of Islam is not necessarily relevant . The point is not that there 's anything intrinsically wrong with it . It may teach a fine code of behavior , and its practitioners may all be wonderful people . But if salvation requires being a follower of Christ , it could still be a Satanic invention . This is a reasonable deduction from the classic Protestant position . Christianity says that salvation is n't a matter of being kind and nice . Those are good things , and we should encourage them . But no one is able to do them enough to be saved . Salvation requires Christ . ( Please forgive me for doing this in Protestant terms . There 's a Catholic equivalent to this that has similar implications , but in different terms . ) A religion may be quite attractive in all visible ways . But if it does n't have Christ , it 's like a diet that consists of food that looks wonderful , tastes great , but is missing some essential food element so that you end up dying . Let me be clear that I am not specifically advocating this position . What I 'm trying to do is ( as usual ) to clarify issues . Indeed it is now relatively uncommon for Christians to believe that all other religions are Satanic . Most Christians regard such beliefs as an unfortunate vestige of the past . This is part of a general move within Christianity in the last century or so to a non-judgemental God . Christians now find it hard to believe that God would allow anybody other than a really rotten person to end up in hell , and they find it hard to envision that real malignant spiritual forces are at work in the world doing things like creating superficially attractive alternatives to Christianity . Whether there is actually a sound basis for the shift is a decision that people need to make for themselves . -- clh ]

I 've heard that quite a bit recently , ... . My question is whether that statement is consistent with Christianity . I would think not . Hate begets more hate , never love . ... . In the summary of the law , Christ commands us to love God and to love our neighbors . He does n't say anything about hate . In fact , if anything , he commands us to save our criticisms for ourselves . ... . - Scott I too dislike the phrase `` Hate the sin , love the sinner '' . Maybe the definite article is also part of the problem , since it seems to give us license to fixate on our brother 's peculiar pecadillo which we have managed to escape by a common grace of heredity , economic situation , or culture . Our outrage at evil is too often just a cheap shot . That said , I do n't think Scott has adequately explored the flip side of this coin , namely the love of righteousness . In the Beatitudes , Jesus blessed those who hungered and thirsted for righteousness . In the New Testament , it is never enough just to behave well , one should always actively desire and work for the cause of good . In that sense , it should be impossible to remain dispassionate about evil and its victims , even when these are its accomplices as well . Maybe `` mourn sin , love sinners '' catches the idea slightly better than '' hate '' , but only slightly , since grief usually implies a passive powerless position . A balanced Christian response needs grief , love , and carefully measured , constructive anger . Jesus has all three . The European pietists during WWII whose response to Nazi atrocities was devoid of anger do not fare well as role models , however much love or grief they exemplified . My sister is an actress in New York and a Christian . A few years back , Jack , her long-time professional friend and benefactor , died of AIDS , impoverished by medical bills , estranged from his family , and abandoned by most of his surviving friends . Only my sister and brother-in-law were there with him at the very end . In her grief over Jack 's death , my sister found quite a few targets for anger : callous bureaucracies , the rigid self-protective moralism of Jack 's family , the inertia in Christians ' response to AIDS , and , yes , even Jack 's own lapse in morality that eventually cost him his life . Jack himself shared that last anger . Brought up with strong Christian values , he was contrite over his brief dalliance with promiscuous sex long before his AIDS appeared . ( I imply no moral judgement here about Jack's innate sexual orientation , n.b . ) Maybe the hardest job is making our anger constructive . Van Kelly vek @ research.att.com

At the time of the shooting , no rocks were being thrown at all . The squad was slowly proceeding up a knoll , away from the body of students . Some students were taunting them , and photographs of the incident show at most one or two students who were following and taunting . The series of photographs show the squad slowly proceeding up the hill , while occasionally their NCO , .45 in hand turned back to look at where they came from . All at once , as if on command , the entire squad turned and fired their M1 Garands , firing 30.06 rounds into the crowd ( the NCO can be shown with this 45 at full recoil ) . At least two of the students shot had nothing to do with the taunters ... they were only passing through , and were not participants in the confrontation . There is some dispute whether the Guard was even legally on Campus ... apparently they had not been invited onto the state school by the president , who had conveniently flown the coop , so as not to be around . The governor of Ohio , James Rhodes , had just embarked on a senate campaign , and wanted it to be known that he was tough on peaceniks , so had ordered the guard in . The matter was quickly covered up . Some years later , wounded survivors launched a civil lawsuit against those responsible ... a settlement was made , and under the terms , the plaintiffs could not discuss much , and guilty individuals were not identified ( in fact , those shooters in the squad have been identified ) . It was a tragic incident , but it was not provoked by the students , or apparently by General DelCorso or any of his command . From studying the incident & the photos , IMO it looks like it was an independent action by a small squad of soldiers .

You may want to put Hubble back in the payload bay for a reboost , and you do n't want to clip off the panels each time . For the Gamma-Ray Observatory , one of the design requirements was that there be no stored-energy mecahnisms ( springs , explosive squibs , gas shocks , etc . ) used for deployment . This was partially so that everything could be reeled back in to put it back in the payload bay , and partially for safety considerations . ( I 've heard that the wings on a cruise missile would cut you in half if you were standing in their swath when they opened . ) Back when the shuttle would be going up every other day with a cost to orbit of $ 3.95 per pound : - ) , everybody designed things for easy servicing . -- David M.

How do you ( Mormons ) reconcile > the idea of eternal marriage with Christ 's statement that in the ressurection > people will neither marry nor be given in marriage ( Luke , chapt . 20 ) ? Well , here is something I wrote some time ago in response to a similar question . I hope it helps : [ Begin repeat of previous post ] As for the scripture mentioned I agree that it does seem to be a problem , not only for eternal marriage but marriage in general . Luke 's version has Jesus saying that the children of this world marry and are given in marriage but not those who will attain the kingdom of heaven . It almost sounds like marriage disqualifies one for salvation . ( Matthew and Mark both omit this statement . ) I think the accounts are not as clear as they might be . Let 's have a look at the incident and see if we can come up with some reasonable ideas of what it means . The scriptures involved are Mat 22:23-30 , Mark 12:18-25 , and Luke 20:27-36 . What happened was that the Sadducees , who did not believe in the resurrection , thought they could trap Jesus . They made reference to the `` Leverite '' marriage which required the brother of a man who died without children to take the widow to wife and raise up children . The children would be considered children of the deceased , just as though the woman 's first husband had fathered them . It seems obvious from this that the woman was still considered in a way to be the wife of her first husband . However , the Sadducees concocted a scene in which 6 brothers of the deceased each in his turn failed to father children by the widow . They seem to imply that the Leverite marriage was equal to the first for they ask , `` Whose wife shall she be in the resurrection ? '' At this point it seems obvious that if she is anybody 's wife , it is the first husband . After all , had she borne children they would have been credited to him regardless of which brother was the biological father . It is possible Jesus was refering to this when he says , `` Ye do err , not knowing the scriptures or the power of God . '' ( Mat 22:29 , compare Mark 12:24 , phrase not in Luke 's account ) . Anyway , the Sadducees ask , `` Whose wife will she be in the resurrection , seeing that all 7 had her ? '' Jesus answer is that , '' In the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage ... '' ( Mat 22:30 ) `` When they rise from the dead they neither marry ... '' ( Mark 12:25 ) `` They which are accounted worthy to obtain that world neither marry ... '' ( Luke 20:35 ) All 3 accounts go on to say , `` but are as the angels in heaven '' or the equivalent . I find this last not very helpful since the Bible does not define angels nor give any idea what their life is like . ( Some ministers claim that they are sexless , different that humans etc . but I can find no Biblical support for this . ) I think what Jesus is saying here ( and it is clearest in Matthew's and Mark 's accounts ) is that marriages will not be performed in the resurrection . This goes along with our belief that if a person is to marry at all it must be done on this earth . However , we do believe that a marriage performed by the authority of God can be binding in eternity . In fact , the first marriage appears to have been performed by God himself before death entered the world ( in the Garden of Eden ) . What therefore God hath joined together , let not man put asunder . ( Mat 19:6 ) Jesus also told Peter and the other apostles that whatsoever they should bind on earth should be bound in heaven ( Mat 16:19 , 18:18 ) . I believe that this also refers to marriages performed by the proper authority .

That does n't include the cradle that would have been in the cargo bay when it was deployed . Spacelab-J on STS-47 was 21,861 lbs ( according to the press-kit ) . As someone else pointed out if they had been unable to deploy it for some reason that would have had to land with it still in the cargo bay and this was a planned for contingency . This is not a problem for the shuttle , though it would eliminate KSC as a landing site , they still have to go to Edwards when landing with something like Spacelab in the cargo bay . -- GaryM -- Gary Morris Internet : garym @ alsys.com TeleUSE Development UUCP : uunet ! alsys.com ! garym Alsys Group ( TeleSoft ) Phone : +1 619-457-2700 x128 San Diego , CA , USA Fax : +1 619-452-1334

Are the boards at all intelligent ? ( I.e. , run by microcontrollers ? ) The easiest thing would be to have another line that says that one of the boards is talking to the PC . When this line was true , the other boards could all hold off and not send their data . This is n't a perfect solution , though , since you have to worry a little about making sure two boards don't decide to talk at the _exact same time_ . Other than that , I think you will need to hook up each board to `` something '' that speaks RS-232 . This actually is n't as hard ( or as expensive ! ) as it used to be , though . Assuming the boards talk relatively slowly ( 9600 BPS or slower ) , the PICs can coordinate things between themselves to multiplex the data . ( This is really just forbicly adding the suggestion in the first paragraph to your system . And it assumes that each board does n't talk more than 1/8th of the time , of for very long , since a PIC is n't going to be able to buffer more than , maybe 20-some bytes ! ) You might want to check into the prices of multi-serial card for your PC , though . I recently bought a Boca Research 2x4 card ( 2 parallel ports , 4 RS-232 ports ) for a very reasonable $ 85 . -- -Joel Kolstad

Since Christians Michael > citing the Bible in such a context should be presumed to have Michael > at least READ the story , it amounts to slander -- a charge Michael > that homosexuality == rape -- to use that against us . and Michael > It is just Michael > as wrong ( though slightly less incendiary , so it 's a Michael > secondary argument from the 'phobic contingent ) to equate Michael > homosexuality with such behavior as to equate it with the Michael > rape of God 's messengers . Let 's review the Sodom and Gomorrah story briefly . It states clearly that the visitors were angels . But `` all the men from every part of the city of Sodom -- both young and old -- surrounded the house . They called to Lot , ` Where are the *men* who came to you tonight ? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them . ' `` For the rest of the story the angels are referred to by the men of Sodom and by Lot as *men* . Furthermore we know from Gen 18:20,21 that the Lord had already found Sodom guilty of grievous sin -- before the angels visited the city . It is clear that the grievous sin of Sodom and Gomorrah involved homosexual sex . It appears that the men had become so inflamed in their lust that they had group orgies in the public square -- which simply indicates the extremity of their depravity . It does not show that lesser degrees of homosexuality are not sinful , as Michael would have us believe . Ultimately our understanding of God 's will for sexuality comes from the creation story -- not solely on the story of Sodom and Gomorrah . He created us male and female , and instituted marriage as a relationship between one male and one female , `` Therefore a man will leave his father and mother , and be united with his wife , and they will become one flesh . '' This marriage relationship is the only sexual relationship which God blesses and sanctions . He regulates and protects the marriage of man and woman , and even uses it as a picture of the relationship between himself and his church . But we find not one word of blessing or regulation for a sexual relationship between two men , or between two women . Everything else that we find in the Bible about sexuality derives from or expresses God 's will in instituting and blessing marriage . Thus the Levitical code , which was given only to the Jews , forbade incest , homosexuality , bestiality ; the Ten Commandments forbade adultery and the coveting of our neighbor 's wife ; other commandments forbade rape . The men of Sodom and Gomorrah were regarded as sexually immoral and perverse ( Jude 7 ) because they abandoned and/or polluted the marriage relationship . Thus also Paul regarded homosexuality as ` unnatural ' , Romans 1:26,27 -- not because this was simply Paul 's opinion , but because it was contrary to God 's purpose in creating us male and female . Michael > Christians , no doubt very sincere ones , keep showing up here Michael > and in every corner of USENET and the world , and ALL they Michael > ever do is spout these same old verses ( which they obviously Michael > have never thought about , maybe never even read ) , in TOTAL Michael > ignorance of the issues raised , slandering us with the vilest Michael > charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can Michael > manage to conjure up , tossing out red herrings with ( they Michael > suppose ) great emotional force to cause readers to dismiss Michael > our witness without even taking the trouble to find out what Michael > it is .

Pink noise has constant power per geometric frequency increment ( octave , 1/3 octave , etc ) . Thus the 10kHz-20kHz octave has the same amount of noise power as the 10Hz-20Hz octave . White noise has constant power per arithmetic frequency increment ( Hz , kHz , etc ) . Thus the 10kHz-10.1kHz band has the same amount of noise power as the 10Hz-110Hz band ( both bands are 100Hz wide ) . Pink noise can be made by passing white noise thru a -3db/octave filter ( usually approximated by a network of several RC pairs ) . Note : you ca n't get -3db/octave by using half a -6db/octave network : - ( Pink noise is commonly used in audio power response measurements .

True , MS products do not boast features that MS invented , but how many products out there by other vendors out there are truely innovative in their continuing development ? I think what makes MS special to the public is thier innovative pricing . It is true the XWindows/MAC/NEXT all have some feature ( s ) in thier GUI that are better than MS . But people like me ca n't afford them . It is true that Apple has lower their pricing on the low end models.. but they are just that ... low end . System 7 is a better operating system , but the machines they operate on just are too expensive for my tastes ... A UNIX platform is powerful enuf , but tell the common user to set up .Xdefault ( i am still confused on what some of them things do ) and they either puke or faint . If u think about it , low prices aint innovative if u come down to it . But for the product it offers and on the lower cost ( and powerful hardware that it runs on as compare to macs ) ... .MS is kinda innovative.. Oh yea , I guess the fact that the support products and applications they have garnered for MSWindows does make them kinda innovative too.. > Dixon D.

Lines : 51 Nntp-Posting-Host : ssc.sas.upenn.edu My 85 Caprice Classic with 120K+ miles has finally reached the threshold of total number of mechanical problems that I am forced to post : ) . Anyone out there who might be able to give me some pointers on one or more of the below , please e-mail or post ! 1 . When making turns , especially when accelerating , there is usually a loud `` thunk '' from the rear of of the car . Sounds like it could be the differential . What could cause this ? Is the differential going bad ? I recently had the differential fluid changed , and it DID have tiny metal bits in it . ( And no , the sound is NOT something rolling around in the trunk ! ) 2 . On starting the car , I get blue ( oil ) smoke from the exhaust for 5-10 seconds . Exhaust valves going bad ? Worn rings ? Anyone know whether the valves on the 4.3 TBI engine can be lapped ? 3 . Brakes . More pedal travel than I feel comfortable with , but master cylinder is full and fluid is relatively clear . Pedal does NOT slowly sink to the floor when held down . Pedal does not feel spongey , but I suppose that bleeding the brakes might help -- could anything else cause this ? 4 . Tranny . Tranny problems seem to be slowly getting worse -- takes almost 2 seconds to downshift from 3rd to 2nd on heavy throttle application , and more recently , it is reluctant to shift from 2nd to 3rd . Fluid ( checked with car running with tranny put through all the gears and then back to park , as per Haynes manual ) is red and clear , and is on full mark . 5 . My springs all around are just about shot -- I have 4 new shocks on , but car still skips out on bumps in turns at moderate to high speed . How hard are they to change ? Can they be reconditioned ? I 'd be interested in hearing from any GM full-size RWD owners out there with stories to tell and/or advice . Here in Philly , these cars are apparently stolen ( ! ) quite often and converted into taxis . Apparently the cab conversion shops will get a junk title for the car or switch VINs with a car about to be junked . About 60 % of Philly cabs are Caprice 's , with most of the rest being Crown Vic 's with a few old New Yorkers and Impalas ( & Broughams ) . -- Andrew White awhite @ mcneil.sas.upenn.edu

If you already own all the `` clone '' equipment then there are lots of such programs ( see a current copy of Unix World Magazine ) . *BUT* your performance WILL suck lemons running an Xserver on a clone . ( From experience ) . You would be much better off with an Xterminal if this is a new install . The performance will be at least four times better . In addition it would be MUCH easier to install and use . On top of that they will cost about the same ( price a clone with 4MB RAM , ethernet card , very high performance graphics card , GOOD monitor , server software , TCP/IP for clone software , mouse , keyboard , etc , etc , etc ... . you spend a whole lot of $ $ $ $ ) . I can get 15 '' Tektronix XP11 terminals for under $ 900 , and the performance is over 80000 Xstones ... .. -- / -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- \ | Mark A.

Is there an independent source for this assertion , or is it all from the Christian Bible ? Is there any record at all of anything he built ? A table , a house , some stairs ( Norm Abrams says the real test of a carpenter 's skill is building stairs with hand tools ) . Did he leave any plans behind for , say kitchen counters and cabinets ? Did he build his own cross ? If so , did he use pressure-treated lumber ? Got ta use that pressure-treated anywhere that wood meets concrete , but it holds up better anyway for mose outdoor applications . I keep seeing these bumper-stickers that say `` My boss is a Jewish Carpenter , '' but they 're always on the back of Ford Escorts , and a real carpenter 's apprentice would probably drive a pickup , so I 'm out for verification that he really was a carpenter .

As an atheist , I do not believe there is a god , nor do I believe that there ever was one . So , those commandments have no meaning to me . Also , there are a lot of ideas that have no meaning to me : The idea of a chosen people , the idea of a given right to the land of Israel , the idea of keeping kosher , the idea of opposing intermarriage , the idea of having a Torah that was inspired by god , etc . By being an atheist , I can not support the idea of the Jewish Nation as defined by a religious principle or based on a religious identity . For me , religion is just another piece in what constitutes the cultural identity of the Jewish people . I believe that as a people with a cultural identity they constitute a Nation and have the same right as any other people in the world to have their own State . The same right as the Armenians have , as the Palestinians have , as the French have , and as anybody else have .

From : neese @ cerritos.edu Subject : Hell Distribution : world Organization : Cerritos College , Norwalk CA Lines : 110 In the King James Version of the Bible there are three differents words translated into the word `` hell '' . These Greek words have totally different meanings . The words are Hades , Tartaros , and Gehenna . In bibical usage , the Greek word Hades is used only 11 times in the New Testament , and is roughly the equivalent to the Old Testament word Sheol ... meaning the grave or pit ( compare Acts 2:27 with Psalms 16:10 ) . Hades may be likened to a hole in the ground . ( In the Bible it has nothing to do with fire ! ) Most modern bibical translators admit that the use in the English word hell to translate Hades and Sheol are an unfortunate and misleading practice . Why ? Because when seeing the word `` hell '' many readers impute to it the traditional connotation of an ever-burning inferno , when this was never remotely intended in the Greek language or in Old English ! In its true bibical usage Hades does indeed refer to the state or abode of the dead , but not in the sense of spirits walking around in some sort of '' shadowy realm . '' Hades is simply the abode we call the grave . All dead go to this hell . The second `` hell '' of the Bible , Tartaros , is mentioned only once in scripture , 2 Pet.2:4 ; `` For if God spared not the angels that sinned , but cast them down to hell ( TARTAROS ) , and delivered them into chains of darkness to be reserved unto judgment ... '' Following their rebellion to unseat God from His throne ( Isa.14:12-14 ; Rev.12:4 ) , the archangel Lucifer ( now Satan ) and a third of the created angels ( now demons ) were ejected from heaven ( Luke 10:18 ) . They were cast down to Tartaros , a place or condition of restraint that God has imposed on the mutinous angels as they await ultimate judgment ( Jude 6 ; 1 Cor.6:3 ) . Tartaros , then , is a `` hell '' that applies only to evil , rebellious angels or demons ( It is interesting that the ancient Greeks used this word to describe the place in which Zeus confined the rebellious Titans ) . Nowhere in the Bible is there any mention of men being put into this particular `` hell '' . The the third word that is translated as `` hell '' in the Bible is Gehenna . It comes from the Hebrew GAI HINNOM , meaning `` valley of Hinniom . '' Hinnom is a deep , narrow ravine located to the south and southwest of Jerusalem . In Old Testament times it was a place of abominable pagan rites , including infant sacrifice ( It was there that the apostate kings Ahaz and Manasseh made their children `` pass through the fire '' to the god Molech . The rites were specifically celebrated in Tophet , the `` place of abhorrence , '' one of the chief groves in the valley ) . King Josiah of ancient Judah finally put an end to these abominations . He defiled the valley , rendering it ceremonially unclean ( 2 Kings 23:10 ) . Later the valley became the cesspool and city dump of Jerusalem ; a repository for sewage , refuse and animal carcasses . The bodies of dispised criminals were also burned there along with the rubbish . Fires burned continuously , feeding by a constant supply of garbage and refuse . Aceldama , the `` field of blood '' , purchased with the money Judas received for the betrayal of Christ ( Matt.27:8 ) was also in part of the valley of Hinnom . So what does this valley called Gehenna have to do with hell ? In Rev.19:20 : the Satan inspired political dictator and a miracle-working religious figure , the False Prophet , working with him will resist the re-establishment of the government of God by Jesus Christ at His Second Coming . Their fate is revealed by the apostle John : `` And the beast was taken , and with him the false prophet ... These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone . '' Where will this temporary lake of fire ( this `` hell '' ) be ? The prophet Isaiah wrote of this lake of fire prepared for the Beast : `` For Tophet ( in the valley of Hinnom ) is ordained of old , yea for the king it is prepared , he hath made it deep and large , the pile thereof is fire and wood , the breath of the Lord , like a stream of brimstone , doth kindle it '' ( Isa.30:33 ) . One thousand years later , Satan himself will be cast into this rekindled fiery lake where the Beast and False Prophet were cast ! ( Rev.20:10 ) . But what of the wicked who have died over the millennia ? Does the Bible say that they are now suffering fiery punishment for their sins in a lake of fire ? In the sequence of Rev.20 the incorrigibly wicked are resurrected to be thrown into the lake of fire after Satan is cast there ! ( Rev.20:15 ) . What will become of these wicked ? Will they writhe in flames for eternity ? The wicked will be burned up from the intense heat of the coming Gehenna fire on the earth . They wil be consumed , annihilated , destroyed ! This punishment will be everlasting ( permanent and final ) . The Bible calls it the '' second death '' ( Rev.20:14 ; 21:8 ) , from which there is no possibility of a further resurrection . The Bible does teach eternal punishment , but not eternal punishing . The prophet Malachi provides a graphic description . `` For , behold , the day cometh that shall burn as an oven , and all the proud , yea , and all that do wickedly , shall be stubble , and the day that cometh shall burn them up ... '' ( 4:1 ) . To the righteous , God says that the wicked shall be `` ashes under the soles of your feet ... '' ( Mal.4:3 ) . Gehenna was a place of destruction and death , not a place of living torture ! Jesus was talking to Jews who understood all about this Gehenna or valley of Hinnom . Utter destruction by fire was complete . Nothing was left , but ashes ! Every text in the Bible translated from this Greek word Gehenna means complete destruction , not living torture ( not eternal life in torment ) ! The Bible says , in Romans 6:23 , `` The wages of sin is death '' , not eternal life in torture . The punishment revealed in the Bible is Death ... the cessation of life . Eternal life is the GIFT OF GOD !

While he is entitled to # believe what his own moral sense tells him , the rest of society is # entitled to pass laws spelling out punishments for behavior that is # offensive to the majority . Why ? Your last statement . Why ? By which authority ? # Most criminals do not see their behavior as moral . The may realize that # it is immoral and not care . They are thus not following their own moral # system but being immoral . For someone to lay claim to an alternative # moral system , he must be sincere in his belief in it and it must be # internally consistent . Why ? Your last statement . Why are these things necessary ? And believe me , a belief in terrorism can be both sincere and frighteningly consistent . # Some sociopaths lack an innate moral sense and # thus may be incapable of behaving morally . While someone like Hitler # may have believed that his actions were moral , we may judge him immoral # by our standards . Holding that morality is subjective does not mean # that we must excuse the murderer . Trouble is , this would sound just fine coming from someone like Hitler , too . ( I do *not* mean any comparison or offence , David . ) Try substituting the social minority of your choice for 'sociopath ' , 'Hitler ' , and 'murderer ' . No logical difference . Someone like you , vs. someone like Hitler . Zero sum . -- Frank O'Dwyer ' I 'm not hatching That' odwyer @ sse.ie from `` Hens '' , by Evelyn Conlon

If it is possible for God to miraculously make a person free of original sin , and free of committing sin their whole life , then what is the purpose of the Incarnation of Jesus ? Why can't God just repeat the miracle done for Mary to make all the rest of us sinless , without the need for repentance and salvation and all that ? I do n't particularly object to the idea of the assumption , or the perpetual virginity ( both of which I regard as Catholic dogma about which I will agree to disagree with my Catholic brothers and sisters in Christ ) , and I even believe in the virgin birth of Jesus , but this concept of Mary 's sinlessness seems to me to be at odds with the rest of Christian doctrine as I understand it . == Seanna Watson Bell-Northern Research , | Pray that at the end of living , ( seanna @ bnr.ca ) Ottawa , Ontario , Canada | Of philosophies and creeds , | God will find his people busy Opinion , what opinions ?

My problem is this . My system only had a IDE cable : for one drive , so I had to buy cable with two drive connectors : on it , and consequently have to switch cables . The problem is , : the new hard drive 's manual refers to matching pin 1 on the cable : with both pin 1 on the drive itself and pin 1 on the IDE card . But : for the life of me I can not figure out how to tell which way to plug : in the cable to align these . Most IDE drives that I have dealt with have had pin 2 labeled on the printed circuit board ( this is sufficient to determine which side is which ) . If your IDE drive does not have a label , then you can look for a polarization notch in the receptacle ( the connector on the drive with the pins ) . If the receptacle is center polarized , that is it has one rectangular notch about 4 mm wide positioned in the center of one side , then you can identify pin 1 as follows : look into the pins with the notch at the top , pin 1 is at the top right . On all drives I have seen this is toward the power connector . As for which pin is pin 1 on the controller , well you can use the same criteria but look hard for the labelling of any pin . Once you know which end pin 1 & 2 are on or pins 39 & 40 ( the oposite end ) , then you are all set . All you need to do is keep the pin 1 end connected to the pin 1 end . You do n't even have to look at the cable itself . Just trace the pin 1 side of the cable through . Usually the pin 1 of the cable is identified by a different color ( red usually ) . But beware - many cable makers are not very careful about this - I have seen cables with pin 40 being the one marked red . Of course with non-polarized connectors this does n't matter - you can plug the cable in either way and YOU decide which side is pin 1. : Secondly , the cable has like a connector at two ends and one between them . : I figure one end goes in the controler and then the other two go into : the drives . Does it matter which I plug into the `` master '' drive : and which into the `` Slave '' ? any help appreciated . thanks ... It does n't matter what gets plugged where . But it does matter how the drives are jumpered . There will be ( amongst other options ) two jumpers that you should be concerned with on BOTH drives . One jumper will select whether the drive is the slave or the master . If it is the master , then a second jumper selects whether or not a slave is present . You will have to consult the docuementation that came with you drives . If you do not have docuementation , then just call the manufacturers hotline number or fax number if they have one . This kind of information is routinely needed by people just like yourself . They will fax you complete info about the jumpers . If you don't have convenient access to a fax machine , then you can usually get voice help . Or post the specific question to this group . ( I probably wo n't be able to help you ) .

True enough , Mary received a blessing beyond any granted in all the history of humanity by being privileged to be the mother of the Savior . It says nothing about Mary needing to be a `` blessed person '' _first_ in order that she might thereby be worthy to bear the Son of God . Again , I think the problem is that as humans we ca n't comprehend how the sinless Incarnation could spring from sinful human flesh and God 's Spirit . Rather than simply accept the gracious miracle of God , we must needs try to dope out a mechanism or rationale as to how this could be . Mary 's own words , '' ... my spirit rejoices in God _my Savior_ , for he has regarded the low estate of his handmaiden , ... '' sound like the words of a human aware of her own humanity , in need of a Savior , similar to what David proclaimed in his psalms ... not the words of a holy being with no further need for God 's grace . I really apologize for harping on this , I do n't suppose it 's important . It 's just that I see Mary and Joseph and the Baby reduced to placid , serene figurines I feel we lose the wonder in the fact that God chose to come down to you and I , to be born of people like you and I , to share our existence and redeem us from it 's fallenness by his holy Incarnation . -- paul marxhausen ... . ... ... . ... ... ... ... . ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... . .. . . . . . university of nebraska - lincoln . . . .. . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . grace . . . . . . . . . . . . happens .

Because the Gun loonies were firing on vehicles with 50mm amunition that has a range of 3000 meters . Next question . The problem is of course the laws that allow a bunch of raving nutters to collect a huge stack of arms in the first place . The sequence of events meant that there really was no option but to attempt some sort of breakthrough via an intervention . If the FBI had had the stomach for it they could have mounted a commando type raid and attempted to save the children by shooting all the adults . It really was a no win situation . Koresh had plenty of opportunity to give up and stand trial for the murder of the 4 ATF officers . Instead he ordered the murder of the children . In order to reject the word of the FBI and BATF it is neccessary to beleive the words of a man who has just murdered 17 children and ordered the suicide/murder of his other 80 followers . According to the account given the BATF attempted to serve a warrant upon Koresh at the ranch and were met by gunfire in a deliberate attempt to murder them . The Koresh/gun supporter claim that the BATF started shooting simply does not stand up . If the AFT had gone there to start shooting they would have gone with heavier grade weaponry than standard issue handguns . For all practical purposes they were unarmed , the B-D followers had automatic weapons . The B-D seige could not be allowed to go on indefinitely . The B-D were quite capable of commiting mass suicide and murdering the children at any time . A commando assault was the only other likely action that could have achieved that objective , that would have been very risky , orders of magintude harder than Antebbe or the Iranian Embassy Seige . Airplanes and Embassies are not designed for defense against attack ranch apocalypse was . 6 terrorists are far easier to disloge without casualties than 80 . Allowing the siege to go on was not an option either , besides the serious risk that Koresh would proclaim armageddon at any moment there was the question of the difficulties of keeping the emmergency team on standby over a prolonged period . The longer the siege went on the more mentally prepared Koresh and his followers would be for a prolonged siege . Rather than go in prematurely the mistake was probably to go in too soon . Can you think of a better way of getting the children out ? A 100 % certain way ? The people who do not want gun control must obviously discount the entire government story . This is simply rationalisation . It is not enough for them to simply dismiss the government as incompetent . That would require them to come up with a solution themselves . Instead they have to come up with a government conspiracy theory whereby the government decided to set out to murder 80 people just to set up some sort of scare to alow them to get gun control legislation through . This conspiracy theory assumes that the BATF deliberately got 4 of its agents killed and that the FBI etc actually enjoy sitting out in the middle of Texas being shot at by religious nutters . Still the conspiracy theory is comforting , it allows them to pretend that WACO proves nothing except about how incompetent the government is in resolving a hostage crisis . No govt in the world has ever faced a comparable situation , quite probably there was no manner in which it could be peacefully resolved . The blame does not rest on the FBI , it rests on the fact that Koresh was allowed to get so far , in particular the person who tipped the B-D off in advance has the murder of 4 ATF agents and 17 children on his or her conscience . There are a large number of people in the US who predict the end of society preach salvation through armed security . The fact is that these are the very people who pose the threat to society in the first place . The next WACO may not be religious nutters but a political movement . A splinter group of the Klu Klux Klan taking over a schoolhouse in a black area for example and holding several hundred children hostage . The only possible solution to such situations that can work is to prevent them arising . No other government in the world has faced such a situation . this is because no other government has so carelessly allowed high power weaponry to become avaliable to any little Hitler or would be Messiah to set themselves up as dictator in their own little empire .

Methods to automatically passwd Authorization from one machine to another . This also includes the problem of notifing the remote host of the current DISPLAY that is being used . 1/ Use rsh/rexec/on ...

My vampire program also uses a variation , however I wrap it as part of the remote command sequence ( EG : xauth add $ auth ) Included in this method is the use of ` xrlogin ' and ` xrsh ' to do this job for you . These programs usally ( the newer ones that is ) allow you to pass a secified list of ENVIRONMENT variables which includes the ` DISPLAY ' and/or a copy of the authorization code required . The ` xon ' program available ( if enabled ) on sun machines will also pass environment variables , as well as the current directory . You will however be required to store the Authority in such a variable for passing . Unless you are also have shared home directories . WARNING : Environment variables and command line arguments are visible in ` ps ' listing with the appropiate flags . As such passing authorization information in environment variables or as arguments is not recomended . The recommended method as given in the manual ( shown above ) is safe from the view of other users . 2/ Wrap it as part of the TERM environment variable . This method uses the fact that most remote command executors do pass the TERM environment variable to the remote host . It is then a matter of an appropiate script in your remote .login file to extract the information from the TERM environment variable and set up things appropiatly . A version of the xrlogin script is available on the network which does this . Basically you change the TERM environment variable before the actual call to rlogin is performed , to include your DISPLAY and your authorization .

Many thanks to those who responded to my question . Unfortunately I have had no luck in actually getting such a font , and a lot of people interested in geting one , and so I have decided to create my own truetype font fitting that description . This font is based on that used in the 1904 issue of Dineen 's dictionary and is typical of that found in Irish books from the early part of the century . This may take me some time to do ( in my limited spare time ) but I 'll make it available to anyone who is interested , when it is ready . The responses I received are summerised below : Kevin Donnelly ( caoimhin @ smo.ac.uk ) mentioned that Michael Everson ( everson @ irlearn.ucd.ie ) had developed some Clo/ Gaelach fonts for the Macintosh and may be able to advise me . I contacted Michael and he told me that he has three fonts available for the Macintosh , and that he will eventually port them to the PC , but that he will be charging IR 100 ( about $ 160 ) for each one . pbryant @ ukelele.GCR.COM mentioned that he uses two font that have a 'nice Irish/Gaelic look to them ' . These are `` Durrow '' and `` American Uncial-Normal '' . I do n't know where you can get these but I don't think that they have the effects I am looking for . Finally , rhiannon @ netcom.com ( Rhia ) mentioned that the `` Meath '' font included in the Casady & Greene Fluent Laser Fonts 2 package is very much like what I was describing . I faxed Casady & Greene for info but got no reply . So that 's it . I 'll post these newsgroups when I make my font available . Colum Twomey .

For one , you have never given a set of morals people agree upon . Unlike a football . Further , you conveniently ignore here that there are many who would not agree on tghe morality of something . The analogy does not hold . One can expect sufficiently many people to agree on its being a football , while YOU have to give the evidence that only vanishing number disagrees with a set of morals YOU have to give . Further , the above is evidence , not proof . Proof would evolve out of testing your theory of absolute morals against competing theories . The above is one of the arguments you reiterate while you never answer the objections . Evidence that you are a preacher . Benedikt

Watch the videotape carefully , the CNN coverage was fairly decisive . The first fire starts in the Tower , this is three storeys high and there is a flag to the right of it on the picture . The second fire starts in another tower which is similar to the first only two storeys high . The flag is on the left in the camera picture that shows this fire starting . Thus the camera pictures cleraly show the fire starting at two separate locations . The FBI report a third . I was not able to verify it from the videotape however someone else identified a fire shown to be starting behind the small tower in the second ( flag on left ) camera angle . The flames coming out of the building are yellow/orange . This is the normal colour for carbon compounds burning . The flames were those of a solid or confined liquid burning , not of a gas exploding . The explosion that occurs mid way along the building is certainly not an explosive though . The cloud itself is on fire . This would seem to be most likely to be some sort of fuel oil store exploding rather than the explosion of a magazine . | > Funny , how considering there was to be a great cache of explosives | > ammunition , etc in the compound , I did not see any series of explosions . Depends entirely on how they were distributed . You would not be able to identify ammunition rounds going off from video camera coverage from a mile away . If and when the FBI release pictures from cmeras on the armoured vehicles ( which presumably exist ) it might be possible to get a clearer picture . If anyone expects to see explosions hollywood style aka Rambo movies then remember that in real life cars do not burst into flames when going over cliffs . Just about the most you could expect would be to see the grenades going off . Since the building was designed to be blast proof to some extent it would be difficult to distinguish the grenades going off from the collapse of the building due to the fire . | > And , oops , the automatic weapons were probably burnt up in the fire | > with the other witnesses .

Your mindset is such that you are simply unable to accept as true anything that might suggest that a group of heavily armed weapons fanatics might indeed be in the wrong . The gun lobby ca n't accept that the B-D set light to the place because that would mean that Koreh had murdered 17 children , that would mean that their taking his account of the murder of 4 BATF agents would be even less credible than it was to start with .

I had gotten an advertisement for it and put it aside with my list of ' I Wants . ' After installing the software , it did n't load . No part of the software would load even though the install went seemingly well . I called Deltapoint with the problem and after asking me twenty million different questions about my system.. concluded that I had one of the systems that the software was 'incompatible with ' . Of course they 're willing to give me my $ $ $ back.. What a waste of time and energy . The folks on their support line , although nice , are extremely ignorant regarding the workings of Windows 3.1 . After my experience with the installation of the SB 16 , I learned some of the function of windows dll files . Before sending back Desktop Animator , decided to do some fooling around with the different versions of .dll files I had . I had 2 versions of cpalette.dll one dated 8/92 and > 100K the other dated 1/93 and smaller ( the 1/93 smaller version was the one supplied with Desktop Animator ) . I moved the bigger , older version of cpalette.dll to a directory outside my path . ( For some reason , I had the older Cpalette.dll in my Windows directory and the newer cpallette in my windows\system directory . ) When I did this , the animator 's editor loaded.. and so did 2 other of the applications in the package.. the main application still did n't load . Does anyone have any ideas as to why this would occur or any further suggestions for trouble-shooting ? ____ / \__ Darla |\ / @ \ \ \_______| \ . : | > Portal : darla @ shell.portal.com \ # # | | \__/ darla @ cup.portal.com | # # # # \__/ \ AOL : kuby2u @ aol.com / / # # \| darlaiam @ aol.com / /__________\ \ WIX : darla |GENIE : KUBY L_JJ \__JJ

HD ) on a SCSI-2 Controller > or > are we talking about a SCSI-1 Controller that had a chip upgrade > using the same chip that is on a SCSI-2 controller board . we are talking about a SCSI-1 device ( e.g . HD ) on a SCSI-2 Controller . Here is a rewrite of my Mac & Info sheet SCSI section : SCSI : only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM . Allows the use of any device : hard drive , printer , scanner , Nubus card expansion { Mac Plus only } , some monitors , and CD-ROM . Normal { asynchronous } SCSI is 5 Mhz ; fast { synchronous } SCSI is 10 Mhz . Difference between these modes is mainly in the software drivers . Main problem : there are a lot of external devices which are internal terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port { A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and end . Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM } . SCSI-1 : 8-bit ; 7 devices per SCSI controller . asynchronous { ~1.5MB/s ave } and synchronous { 5MB/s max } transfers . 8-bit SCSI-2 is often mistaken for a fast version of SCSI-1 { see SCSI-2 for details } . SCSI-2 : fully SCSI-1 compliant . SCSI-2 mode - 10 devices per SCSI controller . 8-bit SCSI-2 is implimented as a very fast SCSI-1 since it can run using SCSI-1 hardware and software drivers which limits it to 7 devices , which results in it sometimes being mistakenly consitered part of SCSI-1 . 16-bit and 32-bit SCSI-2 require different ports , electronics , and SCSI software drivers from SCSI-1 { Which makes them more expensive than other SCSI interfaces } . 32-bit SCSI seems to run only in synchronous mode , hence term 'wide and fast SCSI ' Transfer speeds are 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst { 8-bit } , 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst { 16-bit } , and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst { 32-bit } . 8-bit SCSI-2 is the BIGGEST headache due to the fact that it is the ONLY SCSI-2 that I know of that can pump SCSI-2 speeds through SCSI-1 devices and software controlers . Its MAIN implimentation is on the Mac though you do see adds for SCSI-2 at 10MB/s maximum throughput for PCs . Since 8-bit SCSI-2 does NOT NEED all the hardware { including electonics } and software of 16-bit and 32-bit SCSI-2 it is the CHEEPEST of the SCSI-2 interfaces . Just pop out the SCSI-1 electornics and pop in 8-bit SCSI-2 electronics . Some people consider 16-bit where SCSI-2 REALLY starts { I USED to be one of them } but 4-6MB/s average though put with a theoretical burst of 10MB/s is NOT SCSI-1 but is 8-bit SCSI-2 . Rule of thumb : if it is SCSIn and OVER 5MB/s then it is SOME type of SCSI-2 . 8-bit SCSI CAN use part of SCSI-1 electronics which further reduces its cost compared to 16 and 32-bit SCSI-2 .

Because I have no past experience in a god actually having an effect on my life and because I have never seen evidence for any god beyond what can be explained without the neccessity of a god or which is more convincing than the many fictional works I have read ( And other reasons ) , I do not believe in any god ( s ) . From what I have seen , some people reconcile this lack of evidence by using faith . It is faith in that sense ( the only way I _currently_ understand the word '' faith '' ) that I find intellectually dishonest . > > The ambiguity of religious beliefs , an unwillingness to take > > Pascal 's Wager , > > I 've heard this frequently - what exactly is Pascal 's wager ? Pascal 's wager goes something like this : Premise # 1 : Either there is or there is n't a God . Premise # 2 : If God exists , He wants us to believe and will damn us for not believing . Premise # 3 : If God does not exist , then belief in God does n't matter because death is death , anyway . Conclusion : Belief in God is superior to non-belief because non-belief damns us to eternal punishment if we are wrong , while belief in God only wastes a little time in life if we are wrong . Sound pretty straightforward and is logically sound . The problem is , Premise # 1 presupposes 1:1 odds between belief and non-belief . This is flat out wrong , because of the sheer number of religions out there and the fact that , for the most part , the religions are mutually exclusive . I have heard theists referred to as `` 99 % atheists '' because they believe in their god ( or gods ) to be the _one_ god ( or set of gods ) . The consequence of this is `` what if I pick the wrong god ? '' Suddenly , the odds do n't look so good because picking the wrong god or wrong doctrines of a god still leaves you with the possibility of being wrong and being damned to another god 's version of hell . > > Do I sound `` broken '' to you ? > > I do n't know . You point out that your mother 's treatment upset you , > and see inconsistencies in various religions . I 'm not sure if that > constitutes broken-ness or not . It certainly consititutes > disillusionment . I do n't see how `` disillusionment '' enters into it . You see , I presented my mother 's treatment of me to show the cause of my questioning my atheism , a questioning which continues to this day . I had already been an atheist for five years before having any contact with my mother 's version of Christianity . If anything , I had become somewhat disillusioned with atheism ( uh , oh , I thought , What if there *is* a God ? ) . Yes , in a way , I have also become disillusioned by many religions , simply because I had thought at one time that they had all the answers , if I only found the right one . I 'm still looking , but each time I look in a different place , I become a little stronger in my attitude ( belief , if you will , no faith , though , it 's based on the evidence of past experience ) that I 'll never find a religion which has all the answers . Sorta like looking for Easter eggs . The more time it takes you to find the next one , the more convinced you become that you may already have found all the eggs you 're going to find . Someone else mentioned that critisism is n't going to make me think any more highly of Christians .

In particular I 'm interested to know if any > stigma is attached to the children as opposed to the parents . All children are born pure , i.e. , without sin . However , most saints would view a pregnancy outside of marriage as an occasion of mourning . ( Some church members would be much more judgmental , but that is *their* problem . ) In situations where welfare assistance is provided through our Church , bishops usually require that the family be making some effort to live the Gospel standards and provide for themselves . However , there are occasions when assistance is provided because of the children in the home . As a former bishop of mine said , `` Children are always worthy before God . '' > I 'm especially > keen to learn if there is or is not any prohibition in the Mormon faith on > bastards entering heaven or having their names entered in the big genealogical > book the Mormons keep in Salt Lake City . I am not sure what you mean by the term `` bastards '' in this context . Latter-Day Saints believe that through the temple ordinances the family unit may be preserved in eternity . If you use genealogical material or software produced by the Church , you may notice a section for `` temple ordinances . '' Within that section there should be a spot for signifying `` BIC '' which stands for `` born in the covenant . '' The children born to couple sealed ( married ) within the temple are `` born in the covenant '' and are eligible to be part of that eternal family unit .

I ca n't say if this principle of adoption was revealed at the same time as the sealing ordinances , but it has been accepted for the ~15 years I have been in the Church . I would tend to discount any admonitions from the Church authorities against having children out of wedlock because even though there are provisions within the Lord 's plan to recover what we have done wrong the Church does not want to give anyone the impression we can sin and repent at our leisure .

From : crphilli @ hound.dazixca.ingr.com ( Ron Phillips ) Subject : Waco Questions Nntp-Posting-Host : hound Reply-To : crphilli @ hound.dazixca.ingr.com Organization : `` Intergraph Electronics , Mountain View , CA '' Distribution : usa Lines : 137 Folks , It 's time to start building some precise questions to send to our federal elected officials and to investigative reporters in our local TV , radio and newprint media . Ideally , these questions could be asked at any investigation into the BATF 's and FBI 's participation at the WACO fiasco in hopes of being resolved and , hopefully , wake up the local news media that they are not getting the entire truth from the BATF and FBI . My list is up to 13 that are really nagging at my gut . The list will probably grow . 1 . What were the contents of the original warrant , now sealed , that the BATF obtained ? 2 . It is reasonable to believe that illegal firearms and/or ammunition could not be flushed down the toilet . Therefore , a `` no-knock '' raid could be ruled out . Prior to the initial assault on the complex , did a single BATF agent and accompanying witness ( without a contingent of assault and news media personnel ) attempt to knock on the door of the Branch Davidian 's complex and serve the warrant in a manner prescribed by law ? 3 . On the day of the initial assault on the complex , BATF agents were aware that several small children were inside the buildings . In the ensueing gun battle , BATF agents fired into a building known to contain children , killing at least one two-year old child . Knowing children were present , why did n't the BATF have an alternate plan and immediately retreat from the area close to the complex and implement the alternate plan rather than opening fire and jeopardizing the lives of the children in the building ? 4 . The FBI spokesman states that paper evidence indicates that David Koresh and members of the Branch Davidians possessed over $ 200,000 in firearms and ammunition . Did David Koresh and the members of the Branch Davidians have a valid Federal Firearms License , were they actively participating in the legal business of selling/buying firearms and ammunition , and were any of the weapons they had illegally possessed ? Does this paper evidence consist only of weapons purchased or does it include legally dispossessed weapons . 5 . After the original assault on the compound tragically failed , a BATF spokeswoman stated `` We were outgunned ! '' . Yet , TV newscasts of video tape filmed at the time of the incident show BATF agents armed with MP-5 and AR-15/M16 rifles . Although unclear on the video tape because of obstruction from full view by agent's bodies , they also may have had AK-47 and SKS rifles . What type ( s ) of firearms did the BATF agents have immediate access to at the scene of the original assault on the complex ? 6 . Since there is no evidence to confirm anyone was inside the complex involuntarily , why did the FBI treat it as a `` hostage '' situation ? 7 . Along the same lines , why did the FBI use `` psychological warfare '' techniques , including sensory overload , sleep deprivation , and other disruptive techniques that would test the sanity of any normal person rather than using techniques aimed at placing the complex occupants into a calmer frame of mind ? 8 . Reports indicate several of the children inside the complex were accompanied by their mothers . Since it is reasonable to expect these mothers would have their children taken away from them if they came out , why did the FBI expect the mothers to just walk out and surrender themselves to the authorities ? 9 . Agents at the scene claim to have seen members of the Branch Davidians setting fire to the complex . Branch Davidian members who survived the inferno claim the fire was started when an armored vehicle punched through the wall and knocked over a lantern which was setting on a table . Video tape of the incident does show an armored vehicle punching a hole in the wall and the fire erupted almost immediately from the same general location . Was the source of the fire the same room where the armored vehicle penetrated ? 10 . FBI spokesmen are voicing the opinion that the David Koresh and the members of the Branch Davidians committed mass suicide . Yet , bodies are being discovered throughout the house and other areas within the building complex . This seems to be counter to any known mass suicides through history . What evidence does the FBI have that a mass suicide pact existed ? 11 . FBI Director Sessions stated that the massive fireball shown on the video tape was caused by the Branch Davidian 's ammunition and/or powder cache exploding . Yet , the fireball seems to be more characteristic of the type created when compressed gas or other highly volatile fuel source explodes . Was any evidence found which would indicate the Branch Davidians had an ammunition and/or powder cache which exploded to create this fireball ? If so , and if David Koresh and members of the Branch Davidians were engaged in the legal business of selling/buying firearms , was the amount determined to be excessively greater than one would expect for someone engaged in such a legal business ? 12 . It is rumored that one FBI agent was extremely upset about critical news media coverage and intentionally used an armored vehicle to crush a reporter 's car which had been left at the compound . Is there any factual basis to this rumor and , if so , what charges will be brought against the FBI agent who performed the act ? 13 . FBI Director Sessions states that , during the final assault on the complex , `` over 80 shots were fired at the vehicles . '' On the video tape of the incident , you can hear the drone of the armored vehicles engines . Yet , there is no sound of the sharp reports that one would expect to hear if shots were fired . Also , there are no indications of smoke and/or muzzle flashes appearing from the windows , buildings or other structures in the video . Surely , these should be evident if the Branch Davidians had fired on the armored vehicles . Finally , the video tape does not show any indication of paint splatter , sparks or other characteristic spray of material which should be apparent if the Branch Davidians had fired upon the vehicles . Do any of the armored vehicles which were brought in to pump tear gas into the compound show evidence of fresh damage due to being hit by shots from high-power rifles ? 14 . CS gas is considered to be a chemical warfare agent . The United States has signed international treaties which prevent the use of CS gas in warfare . If the United States could not morally use CS gas against Saddam Hussein and his troops , why is it morally acceptable to use the same agent against citizens of our own land ? 15 . On April 21 , FBI spokesmen state that at least 3 bodies discovered in the complex had bullet wounds to the head indicating they had been murdered or had committed suicide . On April 22 , the county coroner claims he knows nothing about any bodies found with bullet wounds to the head . Were any of the victims bodies found within the burned out complex have bullet wounds to the head ? -- ************************************************************** * Ron Phillips crphilli @ hound.dazixca.ingr.com * * Senior Customer Engineer * * Intergraph Electronics * * 381 East Evelyn Avenue VOICE : ( 415 ) 691-6473 * * Mountain View , CA 94041 FAX : ( 415 ) 691-0350 * **************************************************************

Now you expect that turks living in Greece should be treated like So , the Greek educational system is also in a shambles . History shows that within the last 170 years , Greeks played that game twice : They used Istanbul Patriarch Grigorios in 1822 to instigate the Morea rebellion that resulted in the massacres of the Muslim people . Again , the Orthodox Patriarch Constantine V invited the Russian Czar Nicholas II to invade the Ottoman Empire 'in the name of Jesus , ' and save his flock from Ottoman rule . Source : `` The 'Past ' in Medieval and Modern Greek Culture , '' in Speros Vryonis , ed. , 'Byzantina kai Metabyzantina , ' Vol I ( Malibu , Calif. , 1978 ) . p. 161 . In the words of Professor Skiotis , `` With savage jubilance , [ the Greeks ] sang the words 'Let no Turk remain in the Morea , nor in the whole world . ' The Greeks were determined to achieve to 'Romaiko ' in the only way they knew how : through a war of religious extermination . '' Let me further improve this one for you . After the Ottoman Empire lost World War I , the British landed in 1919 a 200,000 Greek army in Izmir to exterminate the people of Turkiye . Are you suffering from a severe case of amnesia ? The tired and defeated Turks rose up , formed a National Force under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal , and on August 30 , 1922 they annihilated the bulk of the Greek Army . Now wait , there is more . < < The Greek War of Independence brought disaster to the Jewish communities in the Peloponnesos , where the revolution erupted in 1821 . The Jews , because of their close association with the Ottoman administration , were massacred along with the Turks . The Jewish communities of Mistras , Tripolis , and Kalamata were decimated ; the few survivors moved north to settle in Chalkis and Volos , still under Ottoman rule . Patras lost its ancient Jewish community , which was refounded only in 1905. > > Nikos Stavroulakis 'Athens-Auschwitz ' , page ix . Source : Professor Stanford J.

This was the age of nationalism among the Christian subjects of the Sultan , starting with the Greek Revolution early in the nineteenth century , which , based on the Megali Idea , or Great Idea , sought to add to Greek kingdom Istanbul and large portions of Anatolia , union of which with Greece was felt to be the 'dream and hope of all ' . The success of the Greek national movement , provided more in fact by the intervention of the Great Powers than by the efforts of the Greeks themselves , stimulated similar uprisings among the other subjects in Southeastern Europe who had long been oppressed , not so much by the Ottomans but , rather , by the Greek religious hierarchy which dominated the Orthodox millet , leading first to pressure for religious independence , granted to the Bulgarian Orthodox Exarchate in 1870 , to the Serbian Church in 1879 , and to the Rumanian Church in 1885 , with subsequent aspirations for , and achievement of , political independence following ... > > page 188 : < < ... They [ new nationalist leaders ] were greatly assisted in their campaigns against the Ottomans both by the diplomatic and consular representatives of the major Powers of Europe and also by Christian missionaries , who emphasized feelings of Christian superiority and hatred for Muslims and Jews which fortified the religious as well as ethnic bases of their pursuit of independence . Christian nationalism , based as much on religious as on ethnic identity , soon resurrected the medieval bigotries which had devastated both Jews and Muslims and consequently had driven them together in the past . Vicious anti-Muslim and anti-Semitic movements developed , involving large-scale persecutions and massacres carried out by invading armies , by the independent states that resulted , also by Christian subjects who remained within the Empire , particularly because of Jewish and Muslim support for Ottoman integrity in fear of their fate in the emergent nationalist states of Southeastern Europe . The results were explosive and damaging . The invading armies of Russia and Austria as well as the revolting nationalists and , later , successfully established independent Christian states , committed systematic genocide against Jews and Muslims throughout the nineteenth century , despite Great Power admonitions to the contrary in the treaties of Paris ( 1858 ) and Berlin ( 1878 ) , ... > > page 188 : < < ... As the peoples of Southeastern Europe achieved their independence , their Muslim and Jewish minorities were systematically persecuted and massacred , and those who survived were driven beyond the ever-shrinking boundaries of the retreating Ottoman Empire in a kind of slaughter which had not been seen since the dispersal of the Jews from Palestine centuries earlier . This sort of genocide had begun as long before as the late sixteenth century , with the Rumanian Principalities taking the lead , as united Rumania did subsequently during the later years of the nineteenth century . In 1579 the ruler of Moldavia , Peter the Lame , banished its Jews because of their competition with its Christian merchants . When Prince Micheal the Brave revolted against the Ottomans in the Rumanian principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia in 1593 , he ordered the massacre of all the Jews as well as Turks in Bucharest. > > page 189 : < < The slaughter continued well into the nineteenth century . When the Greeks revolted against Ottoman rule many Greek volunteers coming from Russia and the Principalities to join in the effort slaughtered and plundered the Jewish communities along their paths as they went through Moldavia and Wallachia toward Greece. > > page 190 ( second paragraph ) : < < When Venice occupied the island of Chios in 1694 , its Jewish population was either massacred or deported and all Jewish communal and personal property was stolen by the native Greek population , leaving those Jews who returned in utter poverty and reduced to begging , no longer able to compete with the Greeks in trade or commerce. > > page 190 ( third paragraph ) : < < Jews living in Greece and the Rumanian principalities suffered terribly because of their support for Ottoman rule . When the Greek nationalist movement Philike Etairia started its uprising in Wallachia and Moldavia during the spring of 1821 , hundreds of Jews and Muslims were killed by the Greeks who lived there as well as by native Wallachs [ 14 ] . During the height of the Greek revolution , five thousand Jews were massacred in Morea along with most of the Muslim population , numbering about twenty thousand in all [ 15 ] . In Tripolizza alone 1,200 Jews were massacred along with uncounted Turks [ 16 ] . Reverend John Hartley , after describing the carnage , concluded 'Thus did Jewish blood , mingled with Turkish , flow down the streets of captured city . The sons of Isaac and the sons of Ishmael , on this as well as on every occasion during the Greek Revolution , met with common fate . Their corpses were cast out of the city , and , like the ancient sovereign of Judah , they received no burial superior to that of an ass . ' [ 17 ] Jewish communities on the islands of Sparta , Patras , Corinthos , Mistra , and Argos were wiped out by bands of Greek rebels along with those of Thebes , Vrachori , Attica and Epirus [ 18 ] . The surviving Jews fled to the island of Corfu , where Jews who had fled from Italy , and the Iberian Peninsula had lived in peace and prosperity under the Venetian rule since the twelfth century , though divided into rival Greek and Italian communities . It was not long , however , before it too fell victim to the Greek Revolution , leading to savage repression and massacres of Jews , forcing the surviving members of the two communities to come together for self-defense for the first time . Throughout the years of Greek revolution , Greek nationalists went from town to town on the mainland and from island to island in the Agean , exterminating all the Jews and Muslims they could find , many along the roads as they desperately fled to safety in what was left of the Ottoman Empire . Contemporary accounts relate that the Greeks left the murdered Jews and Muslims lying exposed so their bodies could be torn apart by the buzzards [ 19 ] . Most of the Jews who survived these massacres fled across the Agean in small boats to Izmir , thus starting its rise as one of the leading centers of Ottoman Jewish life during the nineteenth century . Only in Northern Greece , particularly in the areas of Janina and Salonica , were the Jews and the Turks able to successfully resist the Greek assaults , thus saving their populations from massacre as well [ 20 ] . During the remainder of the 19th century , particularly during the Greek-Turkish war in 1897 , those Jews who remained in Greece in the areas of Athens , Chalkis , Larissa , Corfu and Crete suffered severe persecution and massacre , forcing thousands more to emigrate into Ottoman territory , particularly to Salonica and Izmir [ 21 ] . > > page 193 ( last paragraph ) : < < The inclusion in the Treaty of Berlin of stipulations providing protection for the Jewish and Muslim minorities in Southeastern Europe stimulated more popular anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim hysteria in all the countries involved , with blood-libel accusations once again being used as pretexts for attacking and ravaging Jewish quarters as well as for new tactics for boycotting Jewish shopkeepers , merchants and professionals , a movement which was quickly adapted by the Christian millets in the major cities of the Ottoman Empire . Because the Bulgarians , Rumanians and Greeks correctly regarded the Jews as supporters of the Turks , both Jews and Turks were expelled from these countries in equally atrocious and brutal manners . Their property was plundered and their homes and shops taken over without compensation , while the survivors fled in desperation to Edirne and Istanbul . While official statements subsequently were issued granting equal rights to Jews , little was done in fact and they continued to be persecuted regularly well into the twentieth century. > > page 194 ( last paragraph ) : < < Things were not much better elsewhere in Southeastern Europe or the Greek islands of the Agean and the eastern Mediterranean . In 1891 the Jews on Corfu were subjected to severe persecution by local Greeks due to the revival of the old ritual murder accusations [ 26 ] . Many of those who survived found refuge in Ottoman territory with the help of a popular subscription drive carried out in Istanbul under leadership of the Banque Camondo . In 1881 and 1884 , and again in 1892 and 1903 , thousands of Jews came to Ottoman territory as a result of pogroms in Russia which went on between 1881 and 1921 with only slight periods of respite . In 1899 Jewish families arrived in Istanbul in flight from persecution in Vidin , in independent Bulgaria . The conquest of Ottoman Thrace and Macedonia by Greek and Bulgarian forces during the Balkan Wars ( 1912-13 ) , including Salonica , Corlu , and Edirne , was followed by general attacks on Jews , their synagogues , homes and shops , in both countries [ 27 ] , resulting in a renewed exodus toward Istanbul and beyond . Two reports from Salonica graphically described the situation caused by the invading armies : 'All the self-interested justifications of the newspapers of Europe , all the lies which they have used to cover up the truth , can never destroy the impression of the terrible anguish which has marked the entry of the Greeks in Salonica . A week of terror and horror one can never easily forget . The Hellenes now cruelly feel today all the damage that the explosion of hatred by the ( Greek ) population has done to their cause . The mob has shown itself odious and the government weak ... The incompetence of the Greek administration and the horrors inflicted by the soldiers has put them in a terrible situation . The consuls guaranteed the absolute safety of the Muslims , but sixty of them were massacred in a single night ... .

From : techie @ cellar.org ( William A Bacon ) Subject : The earth also pollutes ... ... Organization : The Cellar BBS and public access system Lines : 72 FURY OF MOTHER NATURE Man 's contribution to environmental `` pollution '' are paltry compared to those of nature . In her exceptional book TRASHING THE PLANET , former Atomic Energy Commision Chairman Dr. Dixie Lee Ray notes based on the available data , `` all of the air polluting materials produced by man since the beginning of the industrial revolution do not begin to equal the quantities of toxic materials , aerosols , and particulates spewed into the air from just three volcanoes : Krakatoa in Indonesia in 1883 , Mount Katmai in Alaska in 1912 , and Hekla in Iceland in 1947 . '' To which could be added Mount St. Helens in Washington State in 1980 ( which pumped out 910,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide alone ) . El Chicon in Mexico in 1982 ( which sent more than 100 million tons of sulfur gases into the stratosphere ) , and Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines ( which in 1991 hurled upwards of 30 million tons of material into the stratosphere ) . LOS NINOS Many environmentalists attributed the 1988 drought in the U.S. to global warming , but researchers with the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder Colorado reported that the freakish weather was actually due to a natural phenomenon , the interaction of El Nino and El Nina , two massive currents in the tropical Pacific . El Nino is a huge strip of warm water that periodically appears off the coast of South America and disrupts the world 's weather patterns . Now and then , it alternates with El Nina , a mass of cold water that comes from the ocean depths along the equator and drifts for thousands of miles . CHICAGO TRIBUNE 'S Peter Gorner summarized the phenomenon : `` Cold water along the equator clashed with warmer than normal water southeast of Hawaii . The result was both the U.S. drought and the devastating floods that swamped Bangladesh ... ... Nina 's cooler water disrupted tropical weather patterns and distorted the path of the Jet Stream across North America . Then the Jet Stream shoved rain-producing weather systems away from the interior of the U.S. resulting in drought . '' TERMITE TERROR Sundry animals and insects also contribute their share to environmental '' degradation . TIME for April 20,1992 noted that in `` the Netherlands ... manure from pigs poses a major ecological threat , defiling water supplies with excessive nitrites and acidifying local soils . Sheep have permanently scarred the landscape in Spain and Portugal , while in India ... bovines [ cows ] are ravenous wraiths whose constant quest for food drives them to ravage standing forrests . '' The February 1983 issue of SCIENCE DIGEST reported that `` an international team of researchers has discovered that termites generate more than twice the Carbon Dioxide that fuel burning does . '' According to a study reported in SCIENCE for November 5 , 1982 , the `` estimated gross amount of Carbon Dioxide produced [ by termites ] was more than twice the net global input from fossil fuel combustion . '' In addition , `` Termites are a potentially important source of atmospheric methane : they could account for a large fraction of global emmisions . '' The wood-eating pests have a bacteria that enables them too digest carbon so efficiently that some 90 pe is converted too Carbon Dioxide , methane , and other gases they belch into the atmosphere . Ants are another natural source of `` pollution . '' In 1987 , an atmospheric chemist with Bell Laboratories , and zoologists from Cornell University , reported that ants of the subfamily FORMICINAE make and store huge quantities of the formic acid that contributes most of the acidity of rain that falls in remote areas and is found in atmosphere gas and precepitation around the globe . It is abundant , for instance , in the fog and mists that hang over the rain forests of Central Africa . According to the July 6 , 1987 INSIGHT magazine , the `` ants release the acid when defending themselves and communicating with each other and upon dying . Since 30 percent of the world ant population belongs to this subfamily , there is significant concern about the acid the ants release , '' an amount estimated at `` 600,000 metric tons annually . '' which is equal to the combined formic acid contributions of automobiles , refuse combustion and vegetation . '' Clearly , man has a long way to go to match nature as a `` despoiler '' of the environment . By Robert W. Lee . -- -- -- techie @ cellar.org ( William A Bacon ) The Cellar BBS - ( 215 ) 539-3043

From : tauren @ rigel.cs.pdx.edu ( Tauren N Mills ) Subject : Thoughts and questions Article-I.D . : pdxgate.7325 Lines : 35 I just joined this group recently and really do not know much about cryptography , but a couple things came to mind while reading through the posts . 1 . Is the Clipper chip going to be exported ? If not , how will people communicate with other countries ? Will they have to do that in un-crypt-mode . Will other encryption techniques be legal ( assuming the government cracks down on using others ) when going overseas , but not within the states ? 2 . I 've read about authentication systems that use an electronic security card that looks like a calculator to create an encrypted PIN based on the time/date . The host system has the algorithm built into it as well so that it can authenticate a user . Is there some form of encryption technology that would create keys that are only valid at a certain instant in time ? The systems would then allow a `` window '' of time around this instant where the key would work . I realize that this technique would increase the amount of information needing to be stored because you would need entire algorithms rather than just keys . But for smaller scale things it might work . Could some similar method be used to make the two 80-bit keys that are issued to police/FBI/etc to tap a phone only usable for one-week ( for instance ) . If further surveilance was needed , they would have to go back to the escrow service to get another key . This would make it useless for local police to database keys they have used . I assume this is not possible because the receiving phone would need to be able to decypher the message . But any thoughts on the subject ?

From : wcl @ risc.sps.mot.com ( Wayne Long ) Subject : Observation : Floppy copy works under PGM MGR , but not DOS shell . Organization : Motorola ( Austin , TX ) Lines : 51 NNTP-Posting-Host : ome.sps.mot.com Has anyone observed this ? If I copy a large , say 800K+ file ( a large PKZIP file for instance ) to my floppy drive ( 3.5 '' ) under MS Windows 3.1 via either Program Manager or a DOS Shell , the file copied under the DOS shell has errors whereas the file copied from within Program Manager does not . The corruption is detected by executing `` pkunzip -t b : \file.zip '' after both copies . The file copied via the DOS shell always shows corruption . Now here 's the kicker : I have many windows open while doing this ; both DOS and WINDOWs apps . Supposedly all WINDOWs ' apps share the same time slice , whereas the DOS apps get their own equal time slice ( unless overriden ) . So , as an example , I have 5 WINDOWs ' apps open , 2 multitasking DOS sessions running , and one execution-execlusive DOS shell iconized ( inactive ) . Under this scenario , CPU time is divided into two major slices : one for all the Windows apps and one slice for the running DOS app . When copying under Windows PGM MGR , I 'll assume the other Windows and DOS tasks are essentially inactive . Thus PGM MGR gets , say , 80 % of the Windows slice and 95 % of the execution-background DOS shell 's slices . Thus it gets ( .8 ) ( .95 ) ^2 = .72 or 72 % of the total available CPU time . When copying in a DOS shell , I activate the execute-exclusive mode DOS shell ( no other DOS background tasks allowed ) , full screen , under the Windows task manager . The CPU time available to this shell would be 80 % of the Windows slice ( assumming inactive Windows applications ) and 100 % of the DOS slice : ( 1.0 ) ( .8 ) = .8 or 80 % of the total available CPU time . So why do I get copy errors under DOS if it has the greater amount of CPU time ? Is program manager working in a pre-emptive mode during the floppy copy ? It must be !

'' Sean O'Casey in _The White Plague_ by Frank Herbert . Hmmm ... that 's not quite right . The Performa 600 is Real Darn Close to the IIvx ( but a better buy IMO ) . I also do n't think they are so much a 'low-cost business solution ' , but a low-cost _home_ solution . Why else bundle at ease ( among other things ) ? Hardly a business application . What do you mean by 'no `` retail price '' ' . Quite the contrary , I think . The price is darn near the same all across the country . That ( again , IMO ) was one of the selling points of the performas -- ie : no haggling required . Kinda like the Saturn ( car ) of the computer set . One price , medium performance , ready to go . When I shopped for my Performa ( 600CD ) , the difference between Sears ( *sigh ) , Montgomery Wards , Silo ( *sigh ) , Circuit City ( *sigh* ) and Bizmart ( *sigh* ) could n't have been $ 100.00 . Why I chose one over the other was based solely on availability and a friendly salesman who went the extra mile ( when did you last hear that about someone who sells Apples ? ) . Admittedly , except for Montgomery Wards ( and I suspect I was just lucky ) all of the salesfolk I spoke to did n't know didly about the computers , peecee or mac . But then , neither did any of the Apple dealers I spoke with ... If you would 've told me a year ago that I would buy a Macintosh from Montgomery Wards I woulda laughed for a long , long time . Go figure . I 'm *real* happy with my Performa . Oh , and I bought the Apple Performa Plus monitor ( vs. buying 3rd party ) . Happy with that decision as well .

Lines : 42 Extract from the color README file for Anthony 's Icon Library . For Network discussion ... Color Coordination ... I tried to start a discussion in ` comp.windows.x ' at the start of the year about some sort of ` standard color table ' that icons should follow ( say 16 to 32 colors including 5 colors for a small grey scale ) . but no one responded at all . The problem is that if the colors for icons are just used willy-nilly you will soon find that the workstations color table , devotes itself solely the window manager , icons and other ` adminstrative tasks ' instead of applications that actually require the colors for proper working . `` Color needful applications '' such as : Picture and graphic displayers , Animation , Real Time video , Raytracers , etc ... . The following is a suggested color table for icons , and general use . Icons , Window Managers , and general applications , should follow this table or something like it , UNLESS the application is `` color needful '' . * for each primary color ( red , green , blue ) three colors EG : values 0 , 128 and 255 . This results in 3 ^ 3 colors ( 27 ) representing most of the standard colors for use in icons . * two extra shades of grey EG : vales ( black ) 0 , 64 , 128 , 196 and 255 ( white , red , ... ) * 3 other colors -- probably of some primary color to provide shading a and 3-D look to buttons and titlebars in the window manager .

From : richw @ mks.com ( Rich Wales ) Subject : Re : Mormons and eternal marriage ( was Re : Mormon Temples ) Reply-To : richw @ mks.com ( Rich Wales ) Organization : Mortice Kern Systems Inc. , Waterloo , Ontario , CANADA Lines : 40 David Hammerslag asked : How do you ( Mormons ) reconcile the idea of eternal marriage with Christ 's statement that in the resurrection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage ( Luke , chapt . 20 ) ? Several explanations for this seeming contradiction have been proposed , but most LDS scholars whose opinions I have studied take more or less one of the following three positions : ( 1 ) Jesus was talking to a group of people ( Sadducees ) who were trying to trip Him up with what they felt was a silly hypothetical situa- tion that ridiculed the concept of a resurrection ( something they did n't believe in ) . These people -- and those associated with them ( `` Now there were with us seven brethren '' , Matt . 22:25 ) -- would not be receptive to such higher blessings as eternal marriage . Hence , the people in the story would likely not be married in the eterni- ties ; but that does n't mean other , more faithful people could not have this blessing . ( 2 ) Jesus was making a distinction between the state or condition of =being= married , and the process of =becoming= married . The latter activity ( marrying and giving in marriage ) will not take place in the eternities , because all eternal marriages will be taken care of before then . ( 3 ) The account as we have it ( in all three of the synoptic Gospels ) is missing something that would make its real meaning clearer . Note that we ( LDS ) do not believe in Biblical inerrancy , so we do not in general feel obliged to reconcile each and every Bible text with modern revelation through Joseph Smith and other latter-day proph- ets . Nor are we particularly upset that the account in question was not significantly revised in the `` Joseph Smith Translation '' or `` Inspired Version '' of the Bible , since we do not believe this work was completed or that failure to revise a passage in the JST con- stitutes divine approval of that passage as it stands in the KJV . -- Rich Wales < richw @ mks.com > // Mortice Kern Systems Inc.

From : lioness @ maple.circa.ufl.edu Subject : Kubota vs. E & S Freedome Organization : Center for Instructional and Research Computing Activities Lines : 70 Reply-To : LIONESS @ ufcc.ufl.edu NNTP-Posting-Host : maple.circa.ufl.edu More people have been asking for information on the Kubota graphics workstations , so here is some more info on the Kenai/Denali vs. the E & S Freedom . Here is the text of a Denali vs. E & S Freedom done by D.H. Brown Associates . -- -- -- Denali bears a strong resemblance to Evans and Sutherlands Freedom graphics subsystem in several aspects of its high-level design . Both products use a parallel array of 29050 processors for geometric computations . Both have a pixel router to connect this front end to a second array of pixel processors . As a result , Denali and Freedome overlap significantly in performance and functionality . Both design teams also appear to have similar philosophies with respect to modularity , scalability , and market penetration . There remain , however , several important differences between the KPC and E & S products . Evans and Sutherland designed Freedom as a high-end developer 's dream system with plenty of performance potential and flexibility . In its favor , Freedom has configurations from two to sixteen floating point units , a border range that starts and ends at a higher price and performance levels than Denali . All Freedom systems include a large , fixed number of pixel processors that support a broader variety of color blending functions . The Freedom design treats its entire image memory as general-purpose memory , allowing developers to allocate it on a flexible basis to a number of special-purpose applications . Finally , E & S provided Freedom with very flexible otput and video integration features for multimedia and simulation applications . Note that KPC is working an auxiliary board for NTSC and PAL output that will not require an external video encoder . E & S programmable output features , however , will remain much more flexible . The KPC design team , in contrast , made Denali more of an end-user 's system . Entry version have better performance range and flexibility than low-end Freedom configurations , and come in at more realistic mainstream price points . Denali does not need as many 29050 modules as Freedome because it uses a deeper scan-conversion pipeline to support each one , resulting in better cost/performance characteristics . Although both products provide strong support for 3D , imaging , and volume rendering , KPC recognized that not all users will want an even mix of these capabilities . Denali's configuration flexibility allows customers in effect to purchase geometric and pixel processing capabilities separately , and to upgrade them separately as needed . Both companies have implemented hardware texture mapping at workstation price levels as a way to attack SGI 's more expensive VGXT and RealityEngine systems -- the only other products to provide this capability . KPC supports point sampling and bilinear interpolation of textures in hardware , but provides only software support for the higher qualtiy tri-linear interpolated mipmapping method . On balance , however , Denali provideds bettern overall texturing capabilities than E & S for most applications . Aside from being much more affordable , KPC solutions deliver more parallelism for texture processing and more off-screen memory for general graphics data storage . By implementing texture mapping on its transformation modules , E & S foces customers to move very quickly to higher price levels to obtain better texturing performance . Kubota avoids this problem by linking texturing to its Frame Buffer Modules , providing a lower-cost , more scalable solution . Hope this helps , Brian PS This was reprinted without permission .

It does n't wash. Recall that law enforcement gets a court order to tap a suspect 's phone calls . They do what they do now -- figure out which lines to tap . They then record the stuff . If it 's Clipper , they read the law enforcement block , extract the serial number , and get the keys using the court order . No new difficulties ( such as using someone else 's phone instrument or phone line ) are introduced that would n't have existed absent clipper . If the crooks were going to use a pay phone ( say ) , they could have done so without clipper . If the government figures out they 're so doing , they listen in , and if it 's a clipper conversation they get the serial number and then the keys . If the crooks use an innocent person 's clipper phone on the tapped line there 's no problem . The Feds do n't care whose phone instrument is used , just that the conversation is by the suspect on the tapped line . They get the serial number , get the keys , and they are in business . No clipper chip to person association is ever needed . David -- David Sternlight Great care has been taken to ensure the accuracy of our information , errors and omissions excepted .

Let me tell you a story then ... One evening not long in this country a man , a parolee , a convicted KNOWN violent crimminal lead police on high speed chase after breaking another law . He decided that police had no right to do their jobs and enforce the law and assualted two of while attempting to resist arrest . When police use metal sticks to force him into submission we heard all the reason why certain people in this country have and excuse when they refuse to obey the law , how this was a perfect example of police oppression , how all the police had to do was behave a certain way and all would have been finei , how nothing the victim did could have possibly warranted the response - some blows with a few sticks - he got from the authorities . Funny , how when it 's Bloodbath Billy or his hitwench calling the shots , a group of people who were bothering no one , were not know to have broken any law , who asked only that they be left alone to practice their religion as they fit , how it is now that the government is justified in assualting those people with 100 heavily armed commandos simply because the gun grabbers in DC thought these people had more guns thay they thought they should have . Now when it 's the Clinton administration that has the blood of dozens on its hand AAAALL of a sudden it 's the people who refused to have their civil rights violated , it 's their fault , those evil fanatics provoked it ... How is it in the mind of the liberal Democrat-Clinton supporter that a crimminal puke , scum bag , piece of garbage like Rodney King could not have possibly provoked the beating he got , but this bunch of wierdos could cause a fifty one day stand off that ended with the burning deaths of all of them and their children , all by themselves with no help from the the police . And to here people say they deserved what they got , to hear Clinton say the blame rest solely with Koresch , what a cowardly piece of work that man has shown , again , himself to be . WE 'RE blaming the right people . It is you and others that defend ANY of the actions of the BATF , FBI or Justice Department in this matter , that with each word prove again and again the depth of the hypocrisy , the double standard that people like the Clintons would hold certain Americans to . While at the same time allowing others to do as they please with only excuses to offer their victims . It 's all to clear these days , from the comments of the `` president '' and the rationalizations of his supporters in these groups , that in a liberal Democratic vision of America only a certain select few people can expect to have civil rights enforced , and this administration intends to enforce laws , apply the Constitution and obey the laws only when it suits them to do so . The Rooster WARNING ! By order of Heir Clinton and for your own personal safety : Remember to maintain membership in ONLY BATF approved religious organizations . BATF approved religious services . .

I do n't see many people using slip-on's > but they are heavily advertised and half as expensive . > > Thanks ! > Dave > Cost is lower than OEM replacements and they weigh less . Also , in most instances you do not have to rejet the carburetors to get a little more performance . I replaced my OEM canister with an Ontario systems slip on . The mid-range performance is better but I also notice a slight stumble at 2-3K rpm . After talking to Kaz Yoshima , the developer and manufacturer of the slip on , he thinks I might need larger pilot , idle , jets . Was not suppose to but maybe where I live makes a difference . Altitude , barometric pressure ... Anyway , besides that minor glitch , I like the slip on performance and the sound , which is louder than stock , but not loud enough to annoy folks . The Ontario slip on use some sort of sound baffling technique to reduce the sound at full throttle . Just remember , every bike is a tuned system . When you change the intake or exhaust characteristics beyond the allowable delta of the manufacturer , you may have to change other areas to compensate . Like a complete change of the exhaust system , header and muffler , changes the exhaust characteristic to the point which re-jetting is required to compensate for the new engine breathing/pumping profile . Talk with the folks who make the slip on you intend to use and ask them if they have used it on your particular bike . Check with people who have the system also to see what they think about there slip on . Also , as a last data point , in Sport Rider 's first issue , did a review on a group of header and exhaust systems for the CBR600F2 . They also included , as a side bar , the Ontario slip on , the Dyno showed an increase from stock of 5bhp at the rear wheel , 85 verses 91 . Buyer beware , of outrageous claimed increases in horse power ! It may have been true in the past , but not today !

Both Vancouver and Detroit did the same thing last year : They both won their division , they had close to the same number of points , they both went down 3-1 in the first round of the playoffs before finally escaping in 7 games , and they both got knocked out in the second round by teams they should have been able to beat , with less talent . ( Specifically , if I remember correctly , third place teams ) . How does this make Vancouver more improved ?

What I meant , if it was not clear , was the intersection set of liberal and libertarian philosophies of `` natural rights '' and how the government ( and Constitutional interpretation in particular ) fits into that philosophy . This philosophy engages in the very serious practical error of endowing the nine lawyers on the Supreme Court with an almost totalitarian authority , completely outside of the consent or consensus of The People . This is why Supreme Court nominations are such amazing political fist-fights these days , because He who Controls the Court Rules the Country . The people on the Court may well be trying to do the best job they can , but they are at best a benevolent oligarch , even if you approve of every Supreme Court decision ever . Eventually , an oligarch will arise that will decimate that which you hold dear . Try Supreme Court cases by Jury , and the problem would be mitigated a great deal . Those who would create broad , non-enumerated government powers at any level ( as in European Parlamentary Democracies and the current de-facto standard in the U.S. ) have essentially engaged in the same fundamental mistake , except that it is some different body that has the totalitarian , virtually unchecked ( except by plurality election , death , or retirement ) , government power . > And *why* should your community be allowed to stop my activities > when I 'm not picking your pocket or defrauding you ? Just because > you do n't like it ? Because you find it morally repugnant ? This is like asking why the wind blows , unless you can prove that the fact of your engaging in certain activities has absolutely no effect whatsoever on any other human being who has not consented to your engagement in those activities . Very few human activities indeed fit into this category . Even for those few that do , who would you empower to make the judgement of what is and is not a fully autonomous activity ? Who defines `` picking my pocket '' and `` defrauding '' ? Are economic assets a person 's only assets , or are peace of mind , stability , confidence in a child 's emotional environment , security , and many other things not also a part of a person's assets ? What gives you the right to create a moral environment that a parent strongly objects to ? What gives you the right to create an environment of social unrest and instability ? If you say that what you do does not have those effects , by what authority do you say that ? Who is empowered to make these value judgements ? > How > would *you* feel if I got a gang together and found xtianity > ( or insert your favorite cause here ) morally repugnant and > passed laws to outlaw its free exercise ? ( all at a local > level , since that seems to be A-OK with you ) > If the Federal Constitution explicitly prohibited you from doing so , the federal government would prevent you from doing so . If it did not , and you could muster enough local support to pass an amendment to the local Constitution ( by , say , a 3/4 majority ) empowering the local government to do so , then I would have to vote with my feet and move to a neighborhood more friendly to my own system of values . This is not an ideal situation , but it is far better than the mess we are mired in right now . > > As to the `` gang of pitchfork and torch wielding friends '' , there are very > > few restrictive local laws that I personally would advocate or vote for , > > since I am of the view that exercising government power over your neighbors > > should be done with extreme care and only when absolutely necessary .

The debate is not whether you or a > communitity would or would not vote away my rights ; it is > the propriety of whether that should even be an *option* . When you define `` rights '' very broadly , there is no practical choice about whether people will or will not infringe upon your rights since these '' rights '' overlap . Even when rights are defined very narrowly , the government has been empowered to prevent others from infringing on your rights . The fundamental question is , by whose authority is that power created . If you support the current situation with a `` natural rights '' Supreme Court ( rather than an `` original understanding '' Supreme Court or , even better , Supreme Court by Jury ) , you are consenting to having nine lawyers in Washington , D.C. create those powers out of the air . In my `` Fractal Federalism '' scenario , it is a broad consensus of The People ( i.e . the amendment process ) that creates those powers . > > Certainly not the only cause , Mike , but people in a local neighborhood > > should have a voice in what goes on in that neighborhood .

If you create a community where public masturbation is permitted in the cause of `` personal autonomy '' , have you done anything different ?

The Koresh Incident appears to be a horrendous abuse of government power , power possibly illegitimately obtained through a means I would abolish . The constitutionality of `` no-knock '' warrants seems very dubious to me , not to mention the mere existence of BATF and the government 's propensity to ignore the word `` infringe '' in the Second Amendment . This power is upheld by the same body , with its incredible concentration of power in the hands of nine people , that has upheld much so-called `` Civil Rights '' ( read- affirmative action ) legislation despite the Fourteenth Amendment . > > > > Who said anything about the public till ?

There are quacks who do n't treat and quacks who treat . One 's that refuse to diagnose and ones that diagnose improperly . There are lucky quacks and unlucky quacks . Smart quacks and dumb ones . There are people ahead of their time , with unprobable or unproven theories and rationals . There are ill-reasoned , absurd , theorists . Sometimes it 's hard to tell who 's who . Reading a book of ancient jokes it seems that doctors called other doctors quacks in Babylon . Arguments abound when there are n't any firm answers . Plenty of illnesses are n't , or ca n't , be diagnosed or treated . But I think it 's better to argue against the theory , as was originally done with postings on candida a month or so ago . Stating the facts usually works better than simply asserting an opinion about someone 's competency . And you ca n't convince everybody . Sometimes a correct diagnosis takes years for people : they do n't run into a doctor who recognizes the disease , they have n't developed something recognizable yet , or they have something that no one is going to recognize , because it has n't been described yet . Sometimes they get a cure , sometimes the illness wears out , sometimes they stumble on an improper diagnosis with the right treatment , sometimes they find it 's incurable . There is no profit in a patient accepting a hopeless attitude about an illness . Unless it 's a rock solid diagnosis of terminal disease it 's is more like ly that a person will find a cure if they keep looking . -Jackie-

I did n't notice that . Apologies to those who were confused . The substance makes little sense unless one reads the prior messages . However , I do n't wish to enter into this discussion here , as it will be yet another rehearsal of a long-tired set of arguments . Suffice it to say that I disagree both with the interpretation of `` well-regulated '' in the Second Amendment offered by gun lovers , and what I think to be their distortion of the same phrase in the associated Federalist papers . My Webster and my reading of the language convinces me that the word meant both under control , and disciplined , and not 'of good marksmanship ' . I think the latter a special interest pleading . No one has yet shown a contemporateous reference in which `` well regulated '' unambiguously meant 'of good marksmanship ' , and not under control/disciplined , etc .

It 's not scriptural , but comes from the patristic age , I think : something about `` amare errantem , interficere errorem '' , which sounds more like `` love the errant , slay the error '' .

( 1 ) You have no evidence that David Koresh or his followers were '' packing '' that heavy weaponry with any intent to use for other that recreational and self-defense purposes . ( 2 ) Your statement that `` the public also has rights '' is correct only is parsed as `` the individuals who comprise the public also have rights .

( 3 ) Since the `` rights of the public '' of which you spoke are in fact only rights of individuals , the statement that the rights of the public should be placed above the rights of the individual has no meaning . ( 4 ) You have artificially created an illusionary conflict of individuals ' rights when you speak of `` my right to rape your daughter .

Non-toxic tear gas ? ! ? Do you know what tear gas is ? I do : once upon a time I happened to be in a room when someone threw a tear-gas grenade in ( that was supposed to be a joke : ) . The sensation was incredible : I felt my eyes and nostrils were being torn apart . I remember us - a bunch of young men in our early 20 's - running out like a herd of wild animals , knocking down the door and jumping out of the windows ( thank G-d we were on the first floor ) . I ca n't imagine this kind of stuff being used against children . For them , the worst effect might not be the physical effects so much as the psychological effect of being incapacitated without fully understanding the cause . Many years ago , I was accidentally exposed to a tiny dose of tear gas . ( It was in Athens , on the street leading to the American Embassy ; there 'd been a march that had been broken up with tear-gas ; I must have stumbled into a remaining patch of gas the next day . ) Aside from the tears , feeling sick to my stomach , etc. , the really horrible psychological effect was that of suddenly falling to pieces and not knowing why it had happened -- -I was horrified and wondered what disease or other health problem I had . ( I did n't find out about the march and the tear-gas till hours later . ) I can imagine how horribly disorienting this might be to very young children : suddenly crying uncontrollably and feeling sick , weak , and out of control of your body -- -and not knowing the cause . `` This gives us a chance to try the Gas of Peace .

Though I don't > mean to imply that all atheists are angry or hostile , > it does seem to be one motivation for giving up > faith . Thus , some atheism might result from > broken-ness . I 'd like to field this one , if I may . Although I am a believer in and follower of Christ , my experiences with religion have n't been all that positive . In fact , there was one point in my life when , for about three days , I simply _couldn't_ believe in the existence of God . Anyway , when I look back upon the troubles I 've had , they seem to fall into two categories -- impulses to unbelief that resulted from logical contradictions , and impulses to unbelief that resulted from frustration with God . The first category does n't occur to me much anymore , as I have worked through most of the arguments for the non-existence of God . But way back when , these would cause me some problems , and I would have to struggle with my faith to continue to believe . I can see where others less stubborn than I ( and I do mean stubborn . Stubborness has often been the only thing standing between me an atheism from time to time ) would fail . The second category arises out of some long-term personal difficulties and the struggle to live my life as God would have me live it WITHOUT living my life as others would tell me how God would have me live it . A good example of this is my struggle with the more radical Christians I meet . I am not , nor have I ever been , `` on fire for Chirst , '' and I do n't think I ever want to be . Nevertheless , I am not `` lukewarm '' about my faith , so I do n't really fit in with the mainstream either . Quite naturally , I feel a lot of anxiety about my dislocation within Christian society , and it can lead to a lot of internal tension , when I want to do what I _know_ is right , but when another part of me believes that what I want to do is wrong because all the other Christians think so to . Quite naturally , this tension has a destructive effect on my relationship with God , and during all of this internal strife , there 's atheism sitting there like the promised land -- no rules , no responsibilities , no need to live up to anyone 's expectations but my own . Complete freedom . Of course , it 's all an illusion , but nevertheless , it 's a very appealing illusion , especially when the so-called `` people of God '' are behaving like total twits . I can easily understand why someone would go that route , and would be hostile to ever coming back . IMHO , many of the former-Christians-turned-atheists-who-are-now-actively- hostile-to-Christianity are so because their experience with Christ and God was n't a very peaceful one , but one of mind-control and `` shut-up-and-do-what- you're-told-because-we-know-what's-best-for-you-because-it's-God's-will-and- you're-to-young-to-know-what-God's-will-is-yet '' courtesy of some of Christ's more overzealous followers . A final reason why people become atheists is because Christians do not have a very good reputation right now . One of the things that attracted people to Christianity in the ancient days was the love that Christians obviously had for one another and the world around them . Unlike the rest of the world , Christian communities actively cared for their poor , and the Christian rich did not trod on the backs of their poorer brothers , but bent down to help them . Christians were known for living exemplary lives , even if they were thought to be traitors to the state because they would n't sacrifice to the emporer . Nowadays , courtesy of the media and some Christian leaders who lost Christ on their way to power , people see Christians as sexually-repressed hippocritical busibodies who want to remake society into a facist version of their own moral view . There are a lot more reasons why people become atheists , but I do n't have time to go into them right now . Tom Ault

The fact is , it is unlikely that someone reading anything here is going to go into a successful bike-stealing business because they read anything in rec.motorcycles . So please tell us what you are talking about . We can't even protect against an assault , or discuss methods , if you do n't come out with it . See , I have heard the ones about the pipes , and the liquid nitrogen , and the cordless Dremel tools , and a bunch of other ones . The most plausable method ( I am not a bike thief , so I really do n't know for certain ) is just to put a rod through each wheel , and use four guys to just lift the bike into a truck . This works because most people do n't lock their bikes TO anything . Since that method is so childishly easy , I figure a nice , visible chain or cable locking the bike to something is likely to make a lazy thief go on to the next bike .

If we do n't know what you are talking about , we ca n't very well guard against it , can we ? For my money ( literally ) I rely on a combination of a motion-detector alarm with pager when I 'm out of earshot of the bike in a questionable area , C & C insurance , and I try to park in obvious , visible areas with lots of people about . ( See , if someone just plays with the bike without intention of stealing it , at least some eyes are on it , and if they get too rambunctious , they 'll set off the alarm . ) That 's for a nice bike . For a ratbike , the trick is to always keep its actual value well below blue-book , so that it looks so crappy nobody would WANT to steal it , and even if they were stupid enough to , you would make a profit on the deal . : - ) Seriously , if I ( for instance ) need to go on a business trip for a week , and ( sadly ) have to leave the bikes sitting , they both get a shitty-looking , but useable cover , locked on , and both bikes locked to each other and a curb bumper in the parking lot under the light . I usually rig the cable locks I use ( aircraft cable ) so that if anyone pulls on either bike or the cable joining them , the Concours alarm goes off . And I have a friend come buy every day to have a look and make sure they 're still there . The only thing I have ever had stolen was a $ 60 cover , and that was over winter storage , with the battery out of the bike ( and thus no alarm ) . Oh , put your own eyelets into the cover for the locks to pass through , and place them so that they have to absolutely destroy the cover to get it off . That 's the best that I can think of . Most of the locks I see people put on bikes look , well , not too mechanically sound . I like ABUS , since I have personally removed Master locks from lockers with my boot .

IMHO this are going from bad to worse . 3-in-1 , 1-in-3 was bad enough . I do not like a God who prays to Himself . I refuse to believe Jesus prayed to Himself -- let 's get real , if the scriptures say He prayed to the Father , then the Father IS someone different than the Son . I have no problems with multiple Gods . To me , the whole context of the scriptures says : Be perfect , even as your Father Who is in Heaven ; that we can be co-heirs with Christ ; that we will be like Him . Co-heirs share all things equally -- including knowledge , power , dominion etc . When I am like Him ( Christ ) , I will be the same as HE is -- and He is a God . If God can not do this , the His is not all powerful -- and He is NOT God . If He will not , He is a Liar -- and He is NOT God . But if He does , He is the greatest of all the Gods . [ I do n't know of anyone who says that Jesus prayed to himself . The whole point of the Trinity is that there 's enough of a distinction within God that relationship is possible . This implies some sort of communication . I assume that in their `` native '' form , the Father and Son are directly enough connected that prayer in our sense isn't involved . But Jesus is the incarnation of the Son , i.e . the Logos made flesh . When he 's in a human form , his human actions are limited to human capabilities . So communication with the Father takes the form of prayer . I do n't see that there 's anything problematical about that . It seems to be implicit in the whole idea of incarnation . -- clh ]

The significant change this time , and the justification for the hike in the major version number , is : o undo has been implemented . By default only the last change can be undone , but a resource is provided to allow the user to specify how many , including unlimited , levels of undo information should be kept . Also , undo of undo is supported . There is no truth in the rumour that the next version will be EmaXe 19 : - ) -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- For those who have not encountered aXe before here is a summary of what it is all about : aXe is a simple to use text editor for X that represents a significant improvement over xedit . Also built around the Athena Text Widget it features , amongst other things , o multiple windows o multiple buffers o default menu interface o optional button interface , with choice and layout of buttons under user control o minibuffer for expert use and access to external filters o provision for defining a keyboard macro o geometry specification and resizing in terms of characters o file selection via a browser o knowledge of line numbers o parenthesis matching o regular expression searching o restricted or unlimited undo o ability to change font o easy entry of control codes o xterm-like keymap feature o easy runtime setting of selected preferences ( resources ) o both brief and comprehensive on-line help o server mode with cooperating client programs o optional extension language using Tcl o optional Xaw3d widget set compatability o collection of reusable widgets that embody the functionality of aXe I have personally built and run core aXe , i.e . without the Tcl and Xaw3d options , on the following systems : Sun SPARC SunOS 4.1.x MIT X11R5 Sun SPARC SunOS 5.1 MIT X11R5 Encore Multimax UMAX 4.3 MIT X11R5 DEC 5000/120 ULTRIX 4.2 MIT X11R5 HP 9000/710 HP-UX 8.07 MIT X11R5 MAC IIci AU/X 3.0 MIT X11R5 but not all have been subject to the same level of testing . I have only tested the Tcl and Xaw3d options on the first . A number of ' # ifdef SYSV'-isms that have been fed back to me have been incorporated into the code and a possible scandir replacement is provided for those systems that do not have one . Although aXe will probably build under R4 run-time problems have been encountered in the past . I have not bothered to try this version under R4 , and have not put any effort into solving previously known problems . Therefore , if you are at R4 you very much take pot luck . If it does n't work the only alternative is to try the last release , 2.1.1 , of version 2 which should still be around . It does n't have as many features and uses the Widget Creation Library ( Wcl ) . Not only that , it requires an old version of Wcl , 1.06 or 1.05 . Version 3 of aXe was nearing completion when version 2 of Wcl came out so aXe 2 never got converted to make use of it . aXe is available by anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu ( 18.24.0.12 ) and arjuna.ncl.ac.uk ( 128.240.150.1 ) initially , and probably in due course from several other ftp sites .

From : marc @ tanda.isis.org ( Marc Thibault ) Subject : A Trojan Horse on the Clipper Reply-To : marc @ tanda.isis.org Distribution : world Organization : Thibault & Friends Lines : 39 Gentlefolk , It seems to me that the `` Step 1 '' of taking a warrant to the telco to get a wiretap is so much stinky red herring ( don't you love animal metaphors ) . With each phone broadcasting the serial number of its chip ( `` E ( N ; F ) '' is not syntactically different than `` N '' ) , all they have to do is aim a reciever in the general direction of today 's target and use the serial number to identify the session they want , and get the chip number of the other end of the conversation . Even without the key , this is great for traffic analysis . I can think of several ways to learn the right serial number .

First , and I repeat it , I never said that the idea of Jews having the right to have a State is racist . Zionism , as a movement , is more than just that idea . I think that Zionism in the way it defines who is a Jew , for example , is racist-like . In the same way I believe that Irish have a right to nationalism but I do not support the bombing and killing of the IRA , I believe that Jews have a right to nationalism but I do not support Zionism as it is right now . > > > Here 's where you 're wrong .

Which makes an interesting point . People living in a Jewish State have shown that Jewish culture includes in it Jewish religion but they are not the same . So , the Jewish people living in the Jewish State have shown us that there are some problems in a State where 80 % of the people is secular but Judaism is define according to religious standards , or where marriage is a religious stage , or where the Law of Return defines a Jew according to a religious standard . Did those Israelis who do not believe in god and will never do become non-Jews ? Why should they still define then a Jew based on what is a religious definition ? > > Maybe , I would consider hypocrisy to support Zionism and disregard the > > right to self-determination of the Palestinian people and their struggle to > > reach it . > > If you 'd wanted to say that in the first place , you should have said it > then .

Yes , but the extra encryption could be applied *before* the message is encrypted by the Clipper , so that the wrapper would be fine , the phone 's serial number and the session key would be in the law-enforcement field , etc. , but the message would n't be readable even if the particular Clipper 's key were obtained from the escrow agents .

Viola did n't play for Toronto > last year . Morris did . > The problem with your nihilistic approach , Roger , is that it takes all the sense out of the game . By your line of reasoning , if a guy hits into a double play with one out and the bases loaded , there 's no point in saying that that was a bad thing to do ( if his team won anyway ) or speculating on what might have happened if things had gone otherwise , so the double play is merely an event that happened in the course of a game that was eventually won or lost for unknown reasons . After all , any speculation involves constructing a fantasy about what would have happened but did n't . Roger , do you ever worry that the next pencil you drop will fall to the ceiling instead ? Or are you willing to consider empirical evidence ? Teams go to the post-season when they win more games than anybody else in their division . If they do n't make the post-season , they do n't win the Series . Will you agree that winning a division is a useful intermediate goal in ring-collecting ? If so , you must agree that winning games is a useful intermediate goal towards winning the division , and our disagreements come when we consider how to win games . In your viewpoint as expressed , winning games happens for reasons that can not be analyzed . While many of us are thinking things like `` Base- runners are good , outs are bad , and therefore walks are better than double plays with the bases loaded '' , you are thinking things like '' It 's a team game , so perhaps the double play will cause some mysterious team dynamics that will cause the team to win today '' . The result is that it becomes impossible to say *anything* about individual players . Perhaps Atlanta would have won the Series with me playing left field . After all , perhaps in some way my knowledge and personality would have helped the team more than my complete lack of skill would have hurt it . Therefore , I could be an extremely valuable player . Did Dave Winfield have anything to do with the Jays ' victory ? Probably , but how do you know ? If you replace him with Andres Galarraga , perhaps the Jays would have won , perhaps they would have lost , perhaps they would have defected to Alpha Centauri ( bearing in mind that the flying saucers would not have landed in mid-season had Winfield been DHing for Toronto ) . Was Babe Ruth a good player ? He played on some WS-winning teams , but did he have anything to do with their success ? It is generally accepted that Ernie Banks was a good baseball player , and Jarvis Brown and Dan Schatzeder were n't . It seems to me that anybody who would deny this needs to provide the proof . Now , we have observed things about baseball over the years , both empirically and by looking at the rulebook . It is necessary to score more runs than one 's opponent to win the game , so it would seem important to score runs and to prevent one 's opponent from scoring . Runs are scored while a team is batting , and an inning ends after the third out , so it would seem that making outs is bad while hitting home runs is good . Players have tendencies to hit or pitch at certain levels , and these are usually somewhat consistent from year to year . We do use these statistics to predict winners , and so do you . To make some flat predictions : Barry Bonds will have a higher OBP+SLG than Gene Larkin this year . The Braves will finish ahead of the Rockies in the standings . The Tigers will score more runs than the Royals , but will also give up more . I would be astonished if any of these turned out to be false , and , I suspect , so would you . As a matter of fact , I am pretty sure I can predict all the division winners this year , given 3-4 guesses per division , and this is certainly better than random chance ( and almost statistically significant ) . If you will admit that the Rockies and Mariners are unlikely to meet in the World Series , you must admit that there is some sort of way to measure likelihoods , however fuzzy . > > It is impossible for all other things to be equal so your fantasy is totally > meaningless . > So how about `` real life '' ?

This idea , that the Reformers somehow were the first to bring the Bible to the people in their own language , is a myth . Many vernacular translations of the Bible existed long before the Reformation .

Duh , gee , then we must be talking Christian mythology now . I was hoping to discuss something with a reasonable , logical person , but all you seem to have for your side is a repetition of the same boring mythology I 've seen a thousand times before .

Why ? Says who ? Why can mon & pop have FOA , but IBM be forced , and force is the correct word here , to have REO ? As purchase of IBM is voluntary , then there are very well defined procedures on how IBM chooses to do some things and chooses to do other things .

If the landlord and the tenant ca n't agree , then they both can cease from using each other 's property . Suddenly , by arm waving , by magic , a landlord does not have FOA . And on what basis does the FOA of the landlord `` disappear '' ? It seems that vague terms like `` no contact with tenants '' suffice . Well , I think FOA is one our most important rightts ( in the top 2-3 ) , and by golly , if the State is going to make it suffer , I sure would like to see the heinous crime that justifies the removal of this right . I do n't think `` no contact '' with the tenats is even a crime , much less something that should cause severe interference with important rights . > I suspect that the majority of the people in this country > agree with my position on these extreme cases , particularly > if they are presented in this manner .

I assume that when you say `` publicly owned '' , you are talking about those quasi-State companys that do NOT have shareholders . The companies on the Fortune 500 , for example , are all privately owned . They can give you a list of all of their owners . They have no `` anonymous '' , unknown to them , owners . > By the way , the above analysis is based on the assumption > that the right to freedom of association and the right to an > equal opportunity are both fundamental human rights of equal > importance .

FOA can be derived by any two rational people , on a basis that neither has evil , malicious , or murderous intent towards the others . In short , agreement is mutual , or not at all . Your REO on the other hand , lives only by accepting coercion , the gun , into the situation . And that is self-destructive of the whole argument , because it is based only on might makes right . Sort of like saying , `` nobody has a right to live '' , whereupon I whip out a gun and shoot you dead -- end of argument . -- There are actually people that STILL believe Love Canal was some kind of environmental disaster .

You know , you have a point here , but do n't stop with African Americans ... When I was in high school in the early 1980s , on various occasions I had knives pulled on me , had friends who were stabbed , and I was beaten up repeatedly by those that could n't accept me as different . And don't let the teachers off the hook either . On many many occasions , there were teachers that either resented me or were too scared out of their wits by the bullies to even stop the people who attacked me and they would just watch quietly ... All of this was in a nice white middle class high school . In fact , we were so nice and white that we made sure that the one black kid in my class was unable to go to the prom with his white girlfriend ... This is n't a race thing , it 's the way public schools seem to be run ... I 'd hate to be in high school right now ...

You can live on the diet but you need to up your calories . Where before you had a pat of butter now you need a medium apple ( probably microwave cooked ) . Smaller meals but more of them . Not terrific amounts of meat , it's hard to digest anyway . For comfort and to make the carbohydrate meal `` last '' longer eat pasta or rice which give their calories up slowly rather than bread or corn . Maybe smaller meals as you may be getting less room in the stomach area . Is the baby still coming up . Is it starting to push or rub under your ribs ? How tight are your clothes . You should n't be wearing any clothing that compresses your middle . Be sure not to `` suck in '' your stomach when sitting , again it will put pressure on the digestive tract . Try laying on your sides , back , and stay in reclining positions for the many hours you are being inactive . Easier on your legs ( circulation ) as well . You might try letting the baby '' turn '' or at least not be forced under the ribs during the last months . When you are shortwaisted it 's easy for that baby to end up right under the diaphram , especially if you have tight abdominal muscles . If I had my second one to do over again I think I 'd have tried to loosen up since he did n't turn sideways until late and the relief was enormous . Maybe this doctor does have a thing about weight gain in pregnancy or maybe she just nags all her patients this way . Especially if she 's young . But this gallbladder/whatever problem that might be coming up is something to be avoided if possible . Nausea , etc . can vary from person to person and with each pregnancy . My first pregnancy was miserable . During the second I had very little trouble . Some articles have said that women with nausea had a statistically better chance of carrying their baby .

Pronto . Until as such time as Korea decides > that it wants to abide by the rules of free and fair trade > with the USA and Japan . Now , now , before we get too carried away here ... . Keep in mind that owning any car in Korea is a luxury that only the ruling class can afford . Every government agency worth its salt finds some reason to levy a tax on car ownership ; last I heard , there were seven different fees to pay to own a car . I believe this is the sort of petty bureaucratic inefficiency that new President Kim Young Sam wants to eradicate . Basically , I think the rules came into place as bureaucrats from plebian backgrounds wanted to wreak revenge on the ruling class . In exchange , zaibatsu 's like Hyundai screwed over smaller companies , perpetuating a vicious cycle . I have faith that Korean people can potentially build cars as well as anyone else , but for now Hyundai cars seem to reflect the tensions within society , of screwy components that wo n't work together . Stubborn like a mule , the car either wo n't go forward or wo n't stop at all .

She suffered from asthma at that age and she and her family were living in a prison cell of some sort . She had to ask the 'Lady ' several times in her apparitions about what her name was since her confessor priest asked her to do so . For several instances , the priest did not get an answer since Bernadette did not receive any . One time , after several apparitions passed , The Lady finally said , `` I am the Immaculate Conception '' . So , Bernadette , was so happy and repeated these words over and over in her mind so as not to forget it before she told the priest who was asking . So , when she told the priest , the priest was shocked and asked Bernadette , `` Do you know what you are talking about ? '' . Bernadette did not know what exactly it meant but she was just too happy to have the answer for the priest . The priest continued with , `` How did you remember this if you do not know ? '' . Bernadette answered honestly that she had to repeat it over and over in her mind while on her way to the priest ... The priest knew about the dogma being four years old then . But Bernadette did not know and yet she had the answer which the priest finally observed and took as proof of an authentic personal revelation of Our Lady to Bernadette . ( Note : This Lady of Lourdes shrine has a spring of water which our lady requested Bernadette to dig up herself with her bare hands in front of pilgrims . At the start little water flowed but after several years there is more water flowing . ) -Marida `` ... spreading God 's words through actions ... '' -Mother Teresa

From : woody @ praxis.co.uk ( Paul Woodman ) Subject : HELP : FDHD failure in IIcx Organization : Praxis , Bath , U.K. Lines : 60 REPOST - DUE TO NET PROBLEMS Hi , I have problems with the FDHD on a IICX that EKG reports is ROM revision 376 . I had reports that this Mac was having trouble formatting disks and by the time I got to it , the FDHD just would not respond although all other functions were fine . I checked the voltages on the DB19 external drive connector and pin 6 showed no volts with 7 and 8 giving 25volts unloaded . The power supply is an Astec and I sent it away for repair . With the power supply reinstalled , I now get the following error : With the internal FDHD connected , the Mac boots fine but on completion of boot cycle an alert displays `` The disk is unreadable - do you want to eject it ? '' . For every combination of response , the alert reappears within approx 2 seconds and this error is continuous . The FDHD does spin but there is no head seeking and the FDHD is incapable of ejecting the disk . This error sequence occurs regardless of whether there is a floppy in the drive or not . Pin 6 on the DB19 external connector shows 1.2V , pins 7 and 8 show 10.75V . With the internal FDHD disconnected , the Mac boots fine and works great ( MacEKG reports no errors ) . The DB19 external connector now shows no voltage on pin 6 but pins 7 and 8 show 10.75V . Now , the internal FDHD may be fubar , but I have an apple 800K external drive that gives exactly the same symptoms as the internal drive when connected to either the external DB19 or the internal connector at J16 ( after suitable surgery to the external drive ) . The voltages at J16 ( with the internal FDHD disconnected ) are as follows : PIN Volts PIN Volts 1 - 2 5 3 - 4 5 5 - 6 5 7 - 8 - 9 - 10 5 11 - 12 - 13 10.75 14 5 15 10.75 16 5 17 10.75 18 - 19 10.75 20 5 This machine has a SWIM which I do n't think EKG tests .

It 's not nonsense . When people read what you write , they have to try to associate a meaning to those words . Dictionaries give the meanings of words , do n't they ? Now , I assume that you 'd like to have the words you use mean what you 'd like them to . But the fact is , you 're using very different meanings than are in the dictionary , or you would like the reader to assign them new meanings , which they never had . > It seems that you can not answer to the ideas given by others without insulting > others .

I ca n't imagine that it would be cheaper to build an 8 MB SIMM using 1 Mb DRAMs as the 4 Mb parts reached ( and exceeded ) bit for bit price parity with the 1 Mb parts some time ago . It 's probably possible to build a single-bank 8 MB SIMM using 4 Mb parts - this could cause problems in a Q800 .

Good . Very narrow . Very , very narrow . If you 'll recall , I was the nut that advocated the possibility of tactical nukes being militia weapons in certain situations . How can you possibly define what is a weapon and what is n't is only the start of this . > > and also on if you intend the law to be reflective of > > modern practice five months or five centuries down the road . > I would hope so . Let 's define a nuclear weapon as an explosive weapon > whose majority of energy comes from fission and/or fusion of atomic > nuclei . And you 've just described any civilian reactor because your definition fails to note what energy is being considered . Reactors blow with a steam explosion , but the majority of energy still comes from fission or fusion because that is what heated the coolant . See what a can of worms this is ? Last I heard , Ft. Calhoun station just north of Omaha , Nebraska was n't considered a weapon . Given the sodium-cooled breeder designs on the blocks now , I can easily envision reactors being household appliances in under twenty years . With the PRISM design , there is *no* operator input needed on the reactor itself , and it is not unreasonable to assume the secondary side can be made equally as automatic in the future . So your definition is flawed in a few respects already . > Let 's define a biological weapon as live organisms or viruses > in such state , quantity , and with such a vector that they could cause > death or serious disease [ further defined ] to a significant number of > people if released in a city , similarly populated area , resevoir , or > cropland . Typhoid Mary would likely fit this bill if she sneezed . If you do n't mind extrapolation , any HIV-positive person also fits this bill if they interact with others in a way that stands any chance of spreading the virus . Finally , that manure pile I mention below fits this definition , as does , say , releasing a pet rattlesnake to the wild . > Nerve gas and mustard gas are well defined . Other poisonous > gasses should be individually banned only if it can be shown that there > is no use not related to weaponry . Licenses should be available for > research purposes on such chemicals . And I can show where any such gas has other uses . For example , perhaps we would like to rid the hay field of gophers . Calcium Carbide is a rock that dissolves in water to produce aceteylne gas . It can be used for welding , in miners lamps , for gassing gophers , or for making carbide bombs and doing some illicit fishing . Toss some in a toilet and leave a lighted cigarette on the seat and you 'll see that it can also be a weapon , just like any other flammable substance . So , now my miners lamps wo n't work , I ca n't do any welding , and I still have those pesky gophers . > I am not a lawyer , but these ideas could certainly be a basis for > definitions . The basis for , but I 'm sure you see that the problem is not in writing a law , it is in writing a law that can not be abused and extended beyond the point where it does any good . > > I 'll give > > you a little hint : see that manure pile in the farmer 's field down the > > road ?

Care to draw a thinner line this time ? > It is not defined as a weapon of mass destruction . Many things are > banned for other reasons . It meets all the criterion of a weapon . It is an instrument that can be used for fighting , even though that is not its intended purpose , and despite there being better weapons around . Given that the aquifers supply a significant part of the country with drinking water , mass destruction is rather a given . It 's not that certain weapons are n't something I 'd rather not see a lot of people having . The problem is that it is nearly impossible to write a law such that it can not be abused upon some pretext or another . The looser your definition , the more ripe for abuse that law is . Furthermore , if you get specific then the old standby is to insert a clause allowing the list of banned things to be added to , generally without going through the hassles of another vote and public reading of the law . Again , ripe for abuse . < Dan Sorenson , DoD # 1066 z1dan @ exnet.iastate.edu viking @ iastate.edu > < ISU only censors what I read , not what I say .

If you have a tape you should note that there are two towers at either end of the building , a big one and a little one . What appears to be merely a long shot of the big tower with the tank in front is in fact the little tower . You can tell beacuse the flag in the foreground switches sides from the right of the picture to the left .

I do n't know the first thing about yeast infections but I am a scientist . No scientist would take your statement -- - `` no convincing empirical evidence to support the existence of systemic yeast syndrome '' -- - to tell you anything except an absence of data on the question . Noring has pointed out the catch-22 that if the `` crazy '' theory were true , you probably couldn't find any direct evidence of it -- - that you could n't observe those yeastie beasties with present methods even if they were there . Noring and the fellow from Oklahoma ( sorry , forgot your name ) have also suggested one set of anecdotal evidence in favor based on their personal experiences -- - namely , that when people with certain conditions are given anti-fungals , many of them appear to get better . So , if you have any evidence *against* the hypothesis -- - for example , controlled double-blind studies showing that the anti-fungals do n't do any better than sugar water -- - then let 's hear it . If you do n't , then what we have is anecdotal and uncontrolled evidence on one side , and abject disbelief on the other . In which case , please , there is no point in yelling back and forth at each other any longer since neither side has any convincing evidence either positive or negative . And I understand that your abject disbelief is based on the existence of people who may get famous or make money applying the diagnosis to everything in sight , making wild claims with no evidence , and always refusing to do controlled studies . But that has absolutely no bearing on the apparently sincere experiences of the people on the net observing anti-fungals working on themselves and other people in certain specific cases . There are also quacks who sell oral superoxide dismutase , in spite of the fact that it's completely broken down in the guts , but this does n't change the genuine scientific knowledge about the role of superoxide dismutase in fighting oxidative damage . Same thing . Just cause there are candida quacks , that does n't establish evidence against the candida hypothesis . If there 's some other reason ( besides the quacks ) , if only anecdotal , to think it could be true , then that is what has to be considered , that is what the net people have been talking about . But again , there is no point in arguing about it . There is anecdotal evidence , and there is no convincing evidence , and there are also some candida quacks out there , I hope everyone can agree on all of that . Thus , it appears to me the main question now is whether the proponents can marshall enough anecdotal evidence in a convincing and documented enough manner to make a good case for carrying out a good controlled double-blind study of antifungals ( or else , forget convincing anybody else to carry out the test , just carry it out themselves ! ) -- - and also , whether they can adequately define the patient population or symptoms on which such a study should be carried out to provide a fair test of the hypothesis .

Well , you can just about set your watch by Honda releasing new models every 4 years and an upgrade half way through the cars life . The local acura dealership tells me that the new Integra will be out very soon , i.e . May/June . Its hard to find specific details as the Integra has been deleted from most of the rest of the world - I have seen them in Canada and Australia as well as the U.S. but it was discontinued after the first generation in Europe .

Here 's the story : ( 1 ) The IIsi * can not * supply a VGA output . However ... ( 2 ) Some VGA-type monitors can adequately deal with the video signal the Mac uses to drive the Apple 13 or 14 inch `` high resolution color display '' -- -i.e. , Apple 's own 640x480 mode . So , if you wish to hook one of these monitors up to your IIsi , you need ( a ) an adapter that converts from the Mac DB-15 connector to the VGA-style high density DB-15 connector , *but* tells the Mac to use it 's own 640x480 mode , not the VGA 640x480 mode , and ( b ) a VGA monitor that can deal with the higher bandwidth of the Mac 640x480 mode over the VGA 640x480 mode ( which as I stated in ( 1 ) above , the IIsi can not produce ) . As far as ( a ) above is concerned , contact James Engineering , Inc. 6329 Fairmount Ave. El Cerrito , CA 94530 510-525-7350 FAX : 510-525-5740 They can probably get you the right adapter . Remember : you do *not* want the run-of-the-mill Mac-to-VGA adapter , because it will try to have your IIsi produce the VGA mode , which it can not ( the computer will just fail to produce any video signal at all ) . Instead , you want an adapter that connects between the Mac-style and VGA-style connectors , but tells the Mac to use the Apple 640x480 mode . Sorry for the poor terminology available for describing this distinction . As far as ( b ) is concerned , make sure to get a monitor that can deal with a horizontal bandwidth of 35 KHz and a vertical retrace rate of 67 Hz . These are the spec 's of Apple 's 640x480 mode . For comparison , the VGA-standard 640x480 mode uses a 31.5 KHz horizontal bandwidth and a 60 Hz . vertical retrace rate . The monitor will probably need to have auto-synch'ing capability , as the Apple mode you 'll be using is n't one of the set of standard modes in the PC compatible world .

From : mcelwre @ cnsvax.uwec.edu Subject : `` The Universe of MOTION '' ( book review ) Organization : University of Wisconsin Eau Claire Lines : 141 ( Book Review ) : `` THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION '' , by Dewey B. Larson , 1984 , North Pacific Publishers , Portland , Oregon , 456 pages , indexed , hardcover . `` THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION '' contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL astrophysical mysteries . This book is Volume III of a revised and enlarged edition of `` THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE '' , 1959 . Volume I is `` NOTHING BUT MOTION '' ( 1979 ) , and Volume II is `` THE BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER '' ( 1988 ) . Most books and journal articles on the subject of astrophysics are bristling with integrals , partial differentials , and other FANCY MATHEMATICS . In this book , by contrast , mathematics is conspicuous by its absence , except for some relatively simple formulas imbedded in the text . Larson emphasizes CONCEPTS and declares that mathematical agreement with a theory does NOT guarantee its conceptual validity . Dewey B. Larson was a retired engineer with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Engineering Science from Oregon State University . He developed the Theory described in his books while trying to find a way to MATHEMATICALLY CALCULATE the properties of chemical compounds based ONLY on the elements they contain . `` THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION '' describes the astrophysical portions of Larson 's CONSISTENT , INTEGRATED , COMPREHENSIVE , GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe , a kind of `` grand unified field theory '' that orthodox physicists and astro-physicists CLAIM to be looking for . It is built on two postulates about the physical and mathematical nature of space and time : ( 1 ) The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE component , MOTION , existing in THREE dimensions , in DISCRETE units , and with two RECIPROCAL aspects , SPACE and TIME . ( 2 ) The physical universe conforms to the relations of ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics , its primary magnitudes are ABSOLUTE , and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN . From these two postulates , Larson was able to build a COMPLETE theoretical universe , from photons and subatomic particles to the giant elliptical galaxies , by combining the concept of INWARD AND OUTWARD SCALAR MOTIONS with translational , vibrational , rotational , and rotational- vibrational motions . At each step in the development , he was able to match parts of his theoretical universe with corresponding parts in the real physical universe , including EVEN THINGS NOT YET DISCOVERED . For example , in his 1959 book , he first predicted the existence of EXPLODING GALAXIES , several years BEFORE astronomers started finding them . They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of his comprehensive Theory . And when quasars were discovered , he had a related explanation ready for those also . As a result of his theory , which he called `` THE RECIPROCAL SYSTEM '' , Larson TOTALLY REJECTED many of the sacred doctrines of orthodox physicists and astrophysicists , including black holes , neutron stars , degenerate matter , quantum wave mechanics ( as applied to atomic structure ) , `` nuclear '' physics , general relativity , relativistic mass increases , relativistic Doppler shifts , nuclear fusion in stars , and the big bang , all of which he considered to be nothing more than MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES . He was very critical of the AD HOC assumptions , uncertainty principles , solutions in principle , `` no other way '' declarations , etc. , used to maintain them . `` THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION '' is divided into 31 chapters . It begins with a description of how galaxies are built from the gravitational attraction between globular star clusters , which are formed from intergalactic gas and dust clouds that accumulate from the decay products of cosmic rays coming in from the ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe . ( Galaxy formation from the MYTHICAL `` big bang '' is a big mystery to orthodox astronomers . ) He then goes on to describe life cycles of stars and how binary and multiple star systems and solar systems result from Type I supernova explosions of SINGLE stars . Several chapters are devoted to quasars which , according to Larson , are densely-packed clusters of stars that have been ejected from the central bulges of exploding galaxies and are actually traveling FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT ( although most of that speed is AWAY FROM US IN TIME ) . Astronomers and astrophysicists who run up against observations that contradict their theories would find Larson 's explanations quite valuable if considered with an OPEN MIND . For example , they used to believe that GAMMA RAY BURSTS originated from pulsars , which exist primarily in the plane or central bulge of our galaxy . But the new gamma ray telescope in earth orbit observed that the bursts come from ALL DIRECTIONS UNIFORMLY and do NOT correspond with any visible objects , ( except for a few cases of directional coincidence ) . Larson 's explanation is that the gamma ray bursts originate from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe , which Larson calls the `` cosmic sector '' . Because the anti-matter universe exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATION to our material universe , with the speed of light as the BOUNDARY between them , and has THREE dimensions of time and ONLY ONE dimension of space , the bursts can pop into our material universe ANYWHERE seemingly at random . Larson heavily quotes or paraphrases statements from books , journal articles , and leading physicists and astronomers . In this book , 351 of them are superscripted with numbers identifying entries in the reference list at the end of the book . For example , a quote from the book `` Astronomy : The Cosmic Journey '' , by William K. Hartmann , says , `` Our hopes of understanding all stars would brighten if we could explain exactly how binary and multiple stars form ... . Unfortunately we can not . '' Larson 's book contains LOGICAL CONSISTENT EXPLANATIONS of such mysteries that are WORTHY OF SERIOUS CONSIDERATION by ALL physicists , astronomers , and astrophysicists . For more information , answers to your questions , etc. , please consult my CITED SOURCES ( Larson 's BOOKS ) . UN-altered REPRODUCTION and DISSEMINATION of this IMPORTANT Book Review is ENCOURAGED .

I know your Bible provides wonderful stories of the things he said and did , but I simply do not believe that he still exists as an entity that has any bearing on this universe or the lives in it , and I similarly do not believe that the god that you worship exists or has ever existed . Period . I view religion in general and Christianity in specific as a 'cultural virus ' that has been passed down from generation to generation because people are often too afraid to think for themselves and claim responsibility for their own fate , so they brainwash themselves and their children into believing the popular myths , and it goes on from there . And eventually Christianity becomes a given -- if so many other people believe in it , it must be right , no ? I do n't believe in any `` life after death '' . I believe that when I die , I die , so therefore it 's up to me to try to bring meaning and purpose to my life in the meantime . I do n't believe that it 's a good thing to humble myself and view pride as a sin -- pride , in moderation , is a constructive thing . I see nothing at all wrong with homosexuality and nothing inferior about women , and my priests lost a lot of my trust when they patronizingly tried to explain the 'faults ' of these opinions to me . I do n't believe in 'loving everyone ' , especially people I 've never met ; while I try to show respect to everyone , my love and admiration is something not easily earned , and I do not feel guilty about denying my respect and consideration to someone who has abused it . If you want me to take your religion the least bit seriously , stop trying to show me how the Bible `` makes sense '' . Start trying to show me that this Jesus person is somehow still influencing anyone 's life here on Earth . -- _/_/_/ Brian Kendig Je ne suis fait comme aucun /_/_/ bskendig @ netcom.com de ceux que j'ai vus ; j'ose croire _/_/ n'etre fait comme aucun de ceux qui existent . / The meaning of life Si je ne vaux pas mieux , au moins je suis autre . / is that it ends . -- Rousseau

I ca n't see the need for a single ( big ? expensive ? heavy ? ) `` mothership '' except for Voyager style flyby missions . A few years ago , I did some calculations on a '' Grand Tour '' space probe launched by a Saturn V in 1975-76 . At the time , I felt that the idea of a big `` mother ship '' had some merit - the Voyagers had to be rather small , lightweight craft due to the limitations imposed by using weak Titan III/Centaur launchers . The concept I examined ( and Michael 's ? ) had a lot in common with the British Interplanetary Society 's Daedalus project for sending a probe to Barnard 's Star - i.e . a large `` bus '' spacecraft carrying several smaller probes to be dispatched when the ship arrives at its destination . The Saturn V supposedly would have been able to launch a 10-ton payload towards Jupiter and beyond . The `` bus '' could have included far more powerful cameras/telescopes/scientific equipment and a heavier/more powerful power source than the Voyagers as there would be no limitations on weight anymore . Extremely important as the Voyagers had to perform most of their measurements within a couple of weeks before and after planetary encounter , and usually at a relatively great distance . -- - The smaller probes carried aboard might have been based on the `` real '' Voyagers , and an even smaller version like the one scheduled for launch towards Pluto in the early 21st century , and would have been released at various points during the mission . The advantages are obvious : the bus would have carried out the same basic Jupiter-Saturn-Uranus-Neptune mission than Voyager 2 did , but in addition two `` sub-probes '' could have been relased at Saturn , examining that planet 's south polar regions before moving on to Pluto . This would have enabled NASA to map both hemispheres of Pluto/Charon by 1986 ... and several other probes could have examined parts of the Jupiter/Saturn/Uranus/Neptune systems that were n't examined in great detail by the Voyagers due to trajectory-related factors . A small `` swarm '' of camera-equipped miniature space probes released a month before encounter would have been too costly for a small Voyager-type mission but entirely feasible if launched from a heavy , well-equipped spacecraft . And would we have learned a lot more about the outer planets ! The reason why the Grand Tour was cancelled was lack of money , of course .

Friedman The Village Voice , May 11 , 1993 , Vol . XXXVIII No . 19 | How The Anti-Defamation League Turned the Notion | | of Human Rights on Its Head , Spying on Progress- | | ives and Funneling Information to Law Enforcement | Roy Bullock wanted to be a spy since he was a teenager in Indiana and read `` I Led Three Lives , '' Herbert Philbrick 's Cold War saga of penetrating the Communist Party for the FBI . Philbrick had become an American folk hero in the 1950s for building dossiers on unsuspecting colleagues . It was a time when Hollywood produced more than 30 films portraying the informer as the quintessential American patriot . In Boston , where Philbrick led three lives as an FBI informant , Communist Party member , and private citizen , the mayor even proclaimed a Herbert Philbrick Day and presented the spy with a plaque . For Bullock , a shy young man who was coming to terms with his homosexuality in the straight-arrow '50s , the life of a double agent was the perfect way to hide his lifestyle while fighting the Communist menace . `` I was fascinated with Herbert Philbrick , '' Bullock recently told federal investigators , `` and so I thought I would try to infiltrate the Communist Part . In 1957 , I went to the Sixth World Youth and Student Festival in Moscow with the American delegation . I gave them [ the FBI a full report on it when I returned , along with some photos I took of some Soviet military vehicles . '' Bullock was hooked . For the next two years , he worked as an unpaid informant for the FBI . But he found his true calling when he became a paid spy for the Anti-Defamation League in 1960 . Now his activities are at the center of the biggest domestic spy scandal in recent American history -- a scandal that may end with the ADL 's criminal indictment in San Francisco . Over a 30-year period , he compiled computer files for the ADL on 9876 individuals and more than 950 groups of all political stripes , including the NAACP , the Rainbow Coalition , ACLU , the American Indian Movement , the Center for Investigative Reporting , Pacifica , ACT UP , Palestinian and Arab groups , Sandinista solidarity groups , Americans for Peace Now , and anti-apartheid organizations . Bullock , who even spied on the recently slain South African nationalist Chris Hani when he visited the Bay Area in April 1991 , sold many of his ADL files on anti-apartheid activists to South African intelligence . Meanwhile , between 1985 and 1993 , the ADL paid him nearly $ 170,000 , using a prominent Beverly Hills attorney as a conduit in order to conceal its financial relationship with Bullock . Last month , police raided ADL offices in Los Angeles and San Francisco , as well as Bullock 's home , confiscating computer files and boxes of documents . According to court records , Bullock 's files contained the driver 's license and vehicle registration information , in addition to criminal histories on individuals -- much of which was allegedly stolen from the FBI and police computers . Bullock , 58 , told the FBI that copies of virtually everything in his computer data base had been given to the San Francisco ADL office . `` Based on the evidence , '' says Inspector Ron Roth , in a police affidavit , `` I believe that Roy Bullock and ADL had numerous peace officers supplying them with confidential criminal and DMV information . '' What 's more , the San Francisco D.A . is investigating Bullock for tapping phones , accessing answering machines , and assuming false identities to infiltrate organizations . Documents seized from Bullock 's home also contained evidence of his forays into Bay Area trash cans : He had the names and phone numbers of employees at the Christic Institute in San Francisco , as well as telephone message slips to staff members ( including names and phone numbers of callers ) , office correspondence listing the names and return addresses of the senders , and inter-office memos . He also had receipts from Christic Institute 's bank accounts at Wells Fargo and Eureka Federal Savings , as well as itemized canceled checks with the names of the payees , the dates , and amounts . Bullock even knew the balance in the Christic Institute 's checking account . Investigations by the FBI and police in San Francisco have revealed that the ADL has shared at least some of its spy gathering material with Israeli government officials . What 's more , Israel apparently used tips from the ADL to detain Palestinian Americans who travelled there . * * * The ADL was established in New York City in 1913 to defend Jews , and later other minority groups , from discrimination . It led the fight against racist and fascist groups like the Ku Klux Klan and the American Nazi Party , and in the 1960s championed the civil rights movement . But there was also a darker side . In the late 1940s , the ADL spied on leftists and Communists , and shared investigative files with the House Committee on Un-American Activities and the FBI . The ADL swung sharply to the right during the Reagan administration , becoming a bastion of neoconservatism . To Irwin Suall , a repentant Trotskyite who heads the ADL 's powerful Fact Finding Department , the real danger to Jews is posed not by the right -- but by a coalition of leftists , blacks , and Arabs , who in his view threaten the fabric of democracy in America , as well as the state of Israel . In the tradition of his ideological soulmate William Casey , Suall directed the ADL 's vast network of informants , who were given code names like `` Scumbag , '' '' Ironside , '' and -- for a spy reportedly posing as a priest in Atlanta -- `` Flipper . '' For years , journalists and liberal members of the Jewish community knew the ADL spied on right-wing hate groups . As long as the targets were anti-Semitic organizations like the Liberty Lobby and Lyndon Larouche , no one seemed to be particularly troubled . But the Bullock case reveals that the ADL also spied on groups that have a nonviolent , and progressive orientation . This apparent massive violation of civil liberties may end with the ADL 's criminal indictment in San Francisco , where the investigation began . The human rights group faces possible criminal prosecution on as many as 48 felony counts , including an indictment for gaining illegal access to police computers . Says one source close to the West Coast investigation , `` It is 99 per cent certain that the ADL will be indicted . '' In the wake of the San Francisco investigation , police probes of ADL spying are spreading to other parts of the country . `` We have received numerous complaints about ADL [ spying ] , '' says Sam Adams , a spokesperson for the mayor 's office in Portland , Oregon . On April 16 , the Harlem-based Black United Fund of New York , and African American self-help group that Bullock allegedly spied on , wrote District Attorney Robert Morgenthau , requesting `` an immediate investigation '' of the ADL . `` The ADL 's actions cause great concern , as it is a direct and flagrant violation -- at minimum -- of our civil rights ... .We call upon you to join with the District Attorney of San Francisco to ... bring and end to this latest form of McCarthyism . '' Gerald McKelvey , a spokesperson for Morgenthau 's office , says , `` We have no evidence before us that warrants any sort of investigation . '' McKelvey adds that Morgenthau offered to assist the FBI and the San Francisco D.A . 's office on their pending investigation . `` They have not , so far , asked for our assistance . '' The ADL acknowledges sharing information on violence-prone groups with law enforcement officials . It also admits to maintaining extensive files on a wide variety of organizations , but says , in a two-page press release , `` The vast majority of ADL 's files are composed of news clips , magazine articles , books , journals , and other documents ... . '' '' ADL has made it clear that it does not and will not countenance violations of the law on the part of anyone connected with the agency , and the process by which the League gathers information is presently under review to insure that no laws are being violated . '' That 's what the ADL says for public consumption . But morale is so low that its employees complain of sleepless nights and crying fits . And even as other Jewish groups circle the wagons around the ADL in a show of solidarity , many do so holding their noses . More than a few Jewish officials privately say the ADL has to decide whether it is a human rights group or a secret police agency . `` The ADL is regarded both inside the Jewish community and outside the Jewish community as the definitive source of information on anti- Semitism and extremist groups , '' says Daniel Levitas , the former executive director of the Center for Democratic Renewal , an Atlanta- based group that monitors anti-Semitism , racism , and hate groups . `` One of the things this scandal has done is that it has completely tainted the ADL 's credibility and reputation with regard to its objectivity . This scandal is going to be a devastating blow to the Jewish community at large because people regard the ADL as synonymous with American Jewry . '' * * * Bullock 's talents as a snoop and his extreme conservatism meshed well with the ADL 's Cold War worldview . In 1960 , he moved to Southern California where he became an ADL spy for $ 75.00 a week . Bullock almost always used his real name when snooping , although he once called himself Elmer Fink when corresponding with supporters of Alabama governor George Wallace . Bullock provided the ADL 's office in Los Angeles with written reports , which were transmitted to Fact Finding Department head Irwin Suall , according to court records . Under Suall 's stewardship , Fact Finding Department had become the ADL 's heart and soul . Located at ADL national headquarters across from the United Nations , the department had assembled a vast library on `` hate groups , '' culling material from publications , speeches , and informants reports . Bullock was more than adept at leading a double life . Not long after moving to California , he ingratiated himself with a woman in the John Birch Society who helped him gain access to the group 's Boston office . There , he found a file the right-wingers were keeping on the ADL . The discovery gave rise to speculation in the ADL New York office that they had somehow been penetrated by the Birchers . Bullock focused almost exclusively on right-wing extremist groups until the early 1970s when ADL L.A. head Milton Sinn was replaced by Harvey Schechter , who encouraged him to target the left as well . A few years later , Bullock moved to the Castro District in San Francisco where he posed as an art dealer . And ADL fact finder who had infiltrated the local Arab community had just been exposed . When the ensuing scandal died down , Bullock was ordered by the ADL to penetrate the Arabs . The ADL was especially concerned about the American-Arab Anti- Discrimination Committee , founded by the former South Dakota senator James Abourezk to combat Arab-bashing . In a page out of the CIA's dirty tricks handbook on penetration and destabilization , Bullock joined the ADC , and then recruited Nazis into the group , apparently trying to discredit it , according to published reports . In 1987 , the ADL sent Bullock to attend the National Association of Arab Americans annual congress in Washington . According to court documents , Bullock was told to find the source of the group 's funds . Bullock was unable to `` follow the money . '' But he did such a good job at ingratiating himself that he was appointed to head a NAAA delegation that visited Congress member Nancy Pelosi . It 's not surprising that the ADL penetrated Arab organizations . But only acute paranoia explains their interest in groups like ACT UP . As far as Bullock was concerned , gay groups in San Francisco were heavily infiltrated by what he called `` gay left revolutionaries , '' prompting him to write about their activities for the ADL . Bullock soon expanded his horizons , moving into the shadowy realm of foreign espionage after Richard Hirschhaut , the head of ADL 's San Francisco office , introduced him to Thomas Gerard in 1986 . Gerard was then a detective with the San Francisco Police Department's Intelligence Unit . Gerard had worked as a demolitions expert for the CIA in El Salvador in the early 1980s , where he apparently had more than a passing interest in right-wing death squads . ( Police searching Gerard 's briefcase found extensive CIA literature about torture and interrogation , photos of blindfolded and chained men , as well as passports made out to Gerard in 10 different names , including Thomas Clouseau . From a remote jungle island redoubt in the Philippines where he fled last November , Gerard told the Los Angeles Times that he will blow the lid off the CIA 's involvement with Latin American death squads if he is indicted in the ADL spy case . ) After their very first encounter in the ADL office , Gerard and Bullock had lunch at McDonald 's , `` I liked Tom right off , '' Bullock later told a San Francisco police investigator whose report of the interrogation was obtained by the _Voice_ . `` Tom is a very charming , roguish character , with a great deal of integrity . Let me say here , I consider Tom Gerard one of the finest policemen I 've ever worked with , absolutely . Honest , capable , intelligent and 100 percent American . '' Before long , Bullock was providing Gerard with confidential ADL reports on various groups and individuals . In turn , Gerard gave Bullock classified police intelligence files on local Arab Americans , skinheads , and others . Bullock told the FBI that Gerard 's material ended up in his ADL reports . `` I would say 99 percent of the data that I got was name , address , and sometimes physical description . Criminal history , very rarely , '' Bullock told investigators . Gerard also gave Bullock a chart that outlined a vast network of Bay Area Arab American businessmen and organizations that allegedly has ties to Middle East terror groups , as well as surveillance photos of Arab Americans receiving weapons training overseas . Bullock claims that U.S. Customs in New York gave Gerard the photos . `` It was understood that Bullock would be very careful with what he did with the information Gerard gave him , and that Bullock would not release it except to the ADL or other law enforcement officers , '' says an FBI report . There was nothing unusual about Bullock 's cozy relationship with law enforcement . By the mid-1980s , the ADL was swapping files with hundreds of `` official friends , '' the organization 's euphemism for U.S. law enforcement and intelligence sources . The ADL 's relationship with the FBI 's counterterrorism office was so close that ADL 's reports on Arab American group 's covert ties to Middle East terrorists were `` must reading . '' It 's no accident that police found a 1986 classified FBI report entitled `` Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine ( PFLP ) -- New York Area '' while searching the ADL 's San Francisco office . In 1987 , ADL spooks investigated seven Palestinians and a Kenyan studying in California universities on student visas . When the ADL discovered they were disseminating PFLP literature , it informed the FBI , which in turn took the case to the Immigration and Naturalization Service . After the INS ordered the students deported as subversives , ADL regional director David Lehrer gloated in the _Los Angeles Times_ about his office 's cooperation with law enforcement , although he's backpedaling now . The `` Los Angeles 8 '' deportation is still under appeal . * * * While the ADL worked quietly with America 's top cops , it enjoyed similar ties with Israel 's spy agencies -- a charge that ADL leaders vehemently deny . But as early as July 7 , 1961 , ADL director Benjamin Epstein wrote to B'nai B'rith executive secretary Saul Joftes , requesting $ 25,000 for his investigators . `` Our information , '' he boasted to Joftes , `` in addition to being essential for our own operations , has been of great value and service to both the United States Department and the Israeli Government . All data have been made available to both countries with full knowledge to each that we are the source . '' In 1987 , the ADL came under FBI scrutiny in the wake of the Pollard spy scandal . While assigned to the Navy 's Anti-Terrorist Alert Center , where he had access to the most closely guarded U.S. secrets , Jonathan Pollard stole thousands of pages of classified documents for Israel , which , according to federal prosecutors , `` could fill a room the size of a large closet ... ten feet by six feet by six feet . '' Pollard 's handler was Avi Sella , an Israeli air force colonel whose wife worked for the New York ADL as a lawyer . Pollard later wrote to friends that a prominent ADL leader was deeply involved in the Israeli spy operation . While there is no proof that anyone connected with the ADL was involved with Pollard , there is evidence that the ADL freely passes information to Israeli intelligence . In March 1993 , the FBI interrogated David Gurvitz , an ADL fact finder in Los Angeles until 1992 when he was fired by Suall for illegally obtaining police information to use against a rival at the Simon Wiesenthal Center . The FBI pointedly asked Gurvitz if he had ever transmitted information to Israel . Gurvitz admitted that in 1992 he had learned from a law enforcement contact that Michael Elias , allegedly a member of a radical PLO faction , was scheduled to travel from San Francisco International Airport en route to Haifa . Gurvitz phoned the deputy Israeli consul general in L.A. with the information . `` Later the same day , '' according to a 15-page FBI interview of Gurvitz obtained by the _Voice_ , `` Gurvitz was called back by another man , who said he was from the Israeli Consulate , and who asked Gurvitz to repeat the information about Elias . Gurvitz did not get this man 's name , but their conversation was in Hebrew so Gurvitz felt confident the man was actually an Israeli Consulate official . '' Among the 12,000 names of private citizens that police found in ADL files in San Francisco was Mohammed Jarad , a 36-year-old Chicago resident who was arrested in Israel on January 25 , for allegedly distributing hundreds of thousands of dollars to Hamas , the large Islamic fundamentalist movement in the Occupied Territories . The Chicago ADL office runs at least three undercover informants who work with `` official friends '' in local law enforcement , according to documents released by the San Francisco D.A . and sources close to the ADL . Given these facts , Arab American groups surmise that the ADL has passed information on Jarad to Israeli intelligence . One technique used by the ADL to monitor the large Arab American community in the Midwest was to scan the local Arab press for funeral notices . According to sources familiar with the practice , ADL investigators in unmarked vans videotaped the Palestinian funerals , which sometimes turned into PLO rallies . Palestinians have been detained at Ben-Gurion Airport simply on the basis of having been filmed attending a funeral in Chicago , according to Suhail Miari , the executive director of the United Holy Land Fund , whose cousin was an Arab member of Israel 's Knesset . Shortly after Jarad was arrested , the Israeli government announced that Hamas was being run from America with money and operational instructions relayed by courier or fax . Israel 's charges were played up on the front page of _The New York Times_ . According to well- placed sources , Yehudit Barsky , an ADL fact finder in New York , worked closely with Israeli officials on this campaign of vilification , introducing `` friendly '' reporters to `` official friends '' in Chicago law enforcement . Barsky , who is fluent in Arabic , prepared an ADL report about how Hamas is funded in America . She identified the Dallas-based Islamic association for Palestine in North America as the front organization for Hamas in the U.S.A. `` Its infrastructure functions as an interlocking network of organizations , small businesses , and individual activists , '' says the February 1993 ADL report , which outlines the organization 's development , its activities on U.S. college campuses , and its `` metamorphosis '' during the Gulf War . It also traces Hamas fundraising through a plethora of alleged front- groups from Plainfield , Indiana , to Culver City , California . It is doubtful that Barsky could have compiled such sophisticated data without the help of `` official friends '' and ADL spies . Barsky refused to comment . But she used to talk to Greg Slabodkin as many as three times a week when he was an opposition researcher for AIPAC , whose spy operation was disclosed last summer in the _Voice_ . `` The level of cooperation was very close , '' Slabodkin said during a recent phone conservation from Israel where he is in graduate school . `` If we felt our files were lacking , we contacted the ADL . '' When Sha'wan Jabarin , a 30-year-old Palestinian human rights worker in the Occupied Territories won a $ 25,000 Reebok Human Rights Award in 1990 , Slabodkin recalls that Barsky faxed AIPAC the man 's entire police file , which she had obtained from the Israeli embassy . Jabarin had been arrested numerous times in Israel , and once confessed to being a member of the PLO after having been severely tortured . Jabarin , who received a short jail term , became an Amnesty International Prisoner of Conscience . Of course , to AIPAC and the ADL , Jabarin was a terrorist . Slabodkin , who was ordered to keep tabs on him when he was in the U.S. to receive his award , called a representative of Al Haq , the Palestinian human rights group that employed Jabarin , to obtain his itinerary . AIPAC even opened a file on musician Jackson Browne , who presented Jabarin with the Reebok award . While the ADL may be able to rationalize its close monitoring of Arabs , and even left-wing gay revolutionaries , it has a far harder time explaining its obsession with spying on anti-apartheid activists . David Gurvitz told the FBI that when he started working as a fact finder for the ADL in L.A. in March 1989 , ADL files already bulged with information about the Israel-South African connection and anti- apartheid groups . `` Gurvitz confirmed that the ADL did routinely collect information on persons engaged in anti-apartheid activities in the United States , '' says the FBI report . While Gurvitz said there were files in the L.A. ADL office dating to the 1930s , he estimated the oldest material on anti-apartheid activities dates back to the late 1970s , paralleling Begin 's rise to power in Israel and a deepening of ties between the Jewish state and South Africa . `` In about August , 1992 , '' says the report of the FBI 's March 3 , 1993 , interview with Gurvitz , `` an anti-apartheid demonstration was held at the South African Consulate in Los Angeles . Participating in the demonstration were the Los Angeles Student Coalition and the Socialist Workers Party . Gurvitz went to two demonstration planning sessions , and a subsequent demonstration . He wrote a report for the ADL on each of the planning sessions and on the demonstration . Copies of the reports were disseminated to Bullock , among others , in care of the San Francisco ADL office . '' In 1986 Bullock learned that the consul general of the South African Consulate in Los Angeles would be speaking in Las Vegas at a meeting organized by Willis Carto , the head of the anti-Semitic Liberty Lobby . `` Suspecting that the Consul General did not know who Willis Carto is , '' says the FBI report , `` Bullock suggested to Gerard that they might want to warn the South Africans . Gerard agreed and informed the Consul General , who canceled his appearance . '' A few months later , Gerard phoned Bullock and told him a South African intelligence officer wanted to meet them . During a rendezvous in a hotel near Fisherman 's Wharf , the South African said he was interested in acquiring information on American anti-apartheid activists . The South African , who called himself Mr. Humphries , also asked for information about groups that were advocating divestments . `` Gerard , who was present throughout the meeting , '' says the FBI report , `` told Humphries that he [ Gerard ] had been employed by the CIA ... .Humphries offered to pay Bullock $ 150.00 per month in exchange for information . Bullock noted that much of the information Humphries said he wanted was already in the possession of Bullock and the ADL . '' Between 1987 and 1991 , Bullock sold information to South African intelligence , receiving steady raises , which he split evenly with Gerard . `` Bullock said it was his impression , though Gerard never explicitly told him so , ( and Bullock never asked ) that Gerard may have been telling the CIA about his and Bullock 's contacts with the South Africans , '' says the FBI report . `` Gerard had said he knew the CIA 'resident agent ' in San Francisco ... .Once , after Gerard dropped Bullock off at Bullock 's residence following a meeting with Louie [ who replaced Humphries as their handler ] , Gerard said he was going to go to the San Francisco CIA office . '' Al the while , Gerard may have been `` tasking '' Bullock for the CIA . `` Bullock recalled that once , after he had met Gerard , Bullock went to Chicago , Illinois to conduct an investigation on behalf of the ADL , '' says the FBI report . `` The target of the investigation was a group called the Palestine Human Rights Campaign . Bullock learned that a woman [ name deleted ] was transporting money between the PLO or the PFLP , and the United States . Bullock told this to Gerard . Gerard later told Bullock that Gerard 's 'guy at the CIA ' would like to know more . Gerard asked Bullock if Bullock would go back to Chicago to gather more information on the Palestine Human Rights Campaign . Bullock , however , never did go back . '' Gerard also seems to have had a close relationship with Mossad , which may have started in 1991 when he went on an ADL junket to Israel . The ADL frequently sponsors trips for American law enforcement officials to Israel , where they are wined and dined and meet their counterparts in various intelligence agencies . According to an affidavit by San Francisco police inspector Roth , the `` all-expense paid trip [ to Israel ] was more or less a thank-you gift and a liaison gesture by the ADL to continue the close relationships it has with specific law enforcement officers from the United States . '' Gerard may have liked what he saw in Israel . A short time after travelling there , he went to Addis Ababa where he helped with Mossad's rescue of Ethiopian Jews . As Gerard 's relationship with South Africa deepened , he talked more openly about his exploits in the CIA . `` Bullock recalled Gerard mentioning that he had been in Algeria on CIA business , and that Gerard discussed the PLO and 'safehouses , ' '' says the FBI report , `` To this Louie once responded that Israeli intelligence had determined that the PLO and the African National Congress were cooperating . Gerard also spoke of having travelled with the CIA to Afghanistan ... . Louie also [ told Gerard and Bullock ] about his adventures inside South Africa as an intelligence officer . Both Gerard and Louie traded 'war stories ' and regaled each other and Bullock with tales of 'narrow scrapes . ' '' Although there is still much mystery about what triggered law enforcement 's investigation of the ADL , it was probably the theft of a classified FBI report on the Nation of Islam from the FBI 's San Francisco office . Police armed with search warrants recovered the report in the ADL San Francisco office . Gurvitz says he had sent a copy of it to Mira Boland , the director of the ADL 's fact finding division in Washington , D.C. Boland was preparing an op-ed piece for _The Washington Times_ , in which she argued that the Nation of Islam should not receive federal funds for the reconstruction of L.A. because the group is anti-Semitic and violence-prone . ( Boland , who had arranged the ADL police junket to Israel attended by Gerard , testified in a 1990 criminal trial in Roanoke , Virginia , that she had worked for the CIA for 14 months and later was a subcontractor for the Defense Department before joining the ADL . During the trial , Boland admitted to sharing information with a CIA official at an invitation- only ADL conference . ) After he was questioned by the FBI last fall , Gerard fled to the Philippines , which has no extradition treaty with America . Gerard is believed to have supplied information from police computers not only to the ADL , but to Israel and South Africa as well . The _San Francisco Examiner_ reported that Gerard may be charged with violating federal espionage laws . Although Bullock worked for the ADL for 30 years , and Irwin Suall praised him in a July 1992 memo as `` our number one investigator , '' the ADL now argues that he was a rogue agent . In its own defense , the ADL also asserts that its fact finders operate no differently than journalists . After all , ask ADL officials , do n't journalists keep files ? But the difference between the practice of journalism and the ADL's method of gathering information could n't be more striking . Journalists place information in the public domain where they are held accountable for falsehoods , distortions , and libel . And for the most part , journalists do n't share their investigative files with foreign and domestic police agencies . The ADL has no such inhibition . Because many of its files are not open to public scrutiny , false information collected by ideologically biased researchers can not be corrected . Once a proud human rights group , the ADL has become the Jewish thought police . `` The ADL says it 's a human rights group not just for Jews but for everyone , '' says Chip Berlet , a highly respected researcher at the Massachusetts-based Political Research Associates , which monitors right-wing extremist groups . `` That 's fine but it ca n't do that and spy on Palestinians . It 's blatantly unethical and frankly immoral . '' `` My argument to people is that the ADL wears four hats . Each of the hats independently is appropriate . It is a broad-based human rights group that looks at the broad issues of prejudice and discrimination . It is a group that defends Jews against defamation . Entirely noble . Nothing wrong with that hat . It is a group , whose leaders , at least , consistently defend the actions of Israel against its critics , which again is entirely appropriate . And it is a group that maintains an information-sharing arrangement with law enforcement . Again , there is nothing wrong for a group to do that . '' `` But you ca n't do all four . It is impossible to do all four and not violate the bounds of ethics . There 's a built-in conflict of interest if you wear all four hats . '' ADL national director Abraham Foxman apparently sees no such conflict . In a September 1 , 1992 , letter to the _Voice_ , Foxman complained : `` ADL has a proud 80-year record of fighting bigotry and promoting civil rights and constitutional freedoms . Any imputation of an effort or motive on our part to smear or stifle the free speech of anyone is false and baseless '' '' Throughout his pieces [ on AIPAC 's spying ] , Friedman describes the dissemination of information as if it were slander , and the existence of files as a token of McCarthyite inclination . The depiction is misleading in several ways . Virtually every journalist , academic , politician and organization keeps files on subjects they deem relevant ; tracing the logic of Friedman 's reckless charges , the Library of Congress is tantamount to the KGB . Moreover , disseminating the public record of a public figure is neither defamation nor McCarthyism . '' But many believe the ADL is increasingly in the defamation business . Ask Jesse Jackson , James Abourezk , or the leaders of the New Jewish Agenda -- all past targets of ADL smears . ( At the same time , the ADL exonerated the fascist World Anti-Communist League , which assisted Ronald Reagan 's covert war against Nicaragua , a policy endorsed by ADL leaders . ) In the early 1980s , researchers Russ Bellant and Berlet asked to meet fact finding head Irwin Suall , to discuss their work on anti-Semite Lyndon LaRouche . `` Our view then of Irwin Suall was that he was this really terrific investigator , '' says Berlet . `` So we introduce ourselves , say what we are up to and Suall leans back in his chair and basically runs down a dossier on each of us : about what our political activities are , who we work with , what organizations we belong to . Obviously , he was just trying to blow us away and he succeeds admirably . We were just sitting there with our mouths open feeling very uncomfortable . '' `` And then he leans forward and says , 'The right-wing is n't the problem . The left-wing is the problem . The Soviet Union is the biggest problem in the world for Jews . It 's the American left that is the biggest threat to American Jews . You 're on the wrong track . You 're part of the problem . ' We were stunned . I was virtually in tears . This is not how I perceived myself . We basically stumbled out of there in a daze . '' -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Letters ( response to Friedman 's article ) The Village Voice , May 18 , 1993 , Vol . XXXVIII No . 20 A LEAGUE OF HIS OWN Robert I. Friedman 's assault on the Anti-Defamation League [ The Anti- Defamation League Is Spying On You . '' May 11 ] demonstrates that he has an axe to grind and his own prejudiced and biased agenda to promote . It also demonstrates that concern for accurate reporting is far down on his list . The story is replete with inaccuracies , innuendos , and outright falsehoods , and conveys a picture of ADL so divorced from reality as to be farcical . Friedman is even wrong on such basic , easily determined facts as where ADL was founded ( Chicago , not New York ) and the building in which ADL 'S San Francisco office is located ( not the Jewish Community Federation building pictured ) . ADL has done the work of fighting haters for 80 years , without '' spying '' on organizations or individuals and with profound respect for the law . Our mission is to monitor and expose those who are anti- Jewish , racist , anti-democratic , and violence-prone , and we monitor them primarily by reading publications and attending public meetings . Through the years , we have published scores of reports on anti- Semitism emanating from both the left and the right . In fact , although Friedman 's bias leads him to assume the contrary , ADL's primary concern is still the far right . Because extremist organizations are highly secretive , sometimes ADL can learn of their activities only by using undercover sources . Friedman 's hyperbole notwithstanding , these sources function in a manner directly analogous to investigative journalists . Some have performed great service to the American people -- for example , by uncovering the existence of right-wing extremist paramilitary training camps -- with no recognition and at considerable personal risk . The information ADL obtains is placed in the public domain , and through the years ADL has established a reputation for accurate reporting . Friedman 's article , by contrast , contains so much misinformation that it would take an article equally as long to set the record straight . A few examples : He states that an `` ADL leader was deeply involved in the [ Jonathan Pollard ] Israeli spy operation , '' and that Pollard's handler 's wife `` worked for the New York ADL as a lawyer . '' Not true . Friedman also states : `` ADL investigators in unmarked vans videotaped Palestinian funerals . '' Not true . Elsewhere , he asserts that ADL was obsessed `` with spying on anti-apartheid activists . '' Again , not true . We could go on and on -- and , of course , Friedman does not reveal *his* sources . The distortion games Friedman plays when he mentions numbers further reveal his lack of objectivity . When it comes to how much ADL paid Roy Bullock a week -- as an independent contractor , not an employee ( an important distinction Friedman also fails to make ) -- he includes the zeros ( $ 75.00 , $ 150.00 ) , inviting the reader to see a large number . By contrast , when he observes that ADL paid Bullock `` nearly $ 170,000 '' between 1985 and 1993 , he chooses not to point out that amounts to little more than $ 20,000 a year -- hardly an excessive sum . What is accurate about Friedman 's story is Chip Berlet 's description of ADL 's four hats . Yes , ADL looks at broad issues of prejudice and discrimination . Yes , ADL defends Israel against critics . And yes , ADL maintains an information-sharing relationship with law enforcement regarding extremist activities and hate crimes . We see no conflict in these four activities , and we believe most _Voice_ readers won't either . ABRAHAM FOXMAN National Director Anti-Defamation League Manhattan -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- ROBERT I. FRIEDMAN REPLIES : For the ADL to compare itself to investigative journalists is absurd . Journalists do n't spy on Arabs and anti-apartheid activists and then freely pass their files to South African and Israeli intelligence . But according to police the confessions of two paid ADL investigators , buttressed by 700 pages of court documents and interviews , the ADL does . Indeed , the ADL spies on groups that are neither anti-Semitic nor violent . Police confiscated ADL files on hundreds of mainstream groups ranging from ACT UP to Peace Now . Respected intellectuals and Middle East scholars who disagree with the ADL 's political views have ended up on ADL blacklists , their reputations smeared . `` Private organizations have no business paying operatives inside police departments or having spies , '' says an April 17 editorial in the _St . Louis Post-Dispatch_ , condemning ADL spying . On April 10 , police armed with search warrants raided ADL offices in San Francisco and L.A. after concluding that `` ADL employees were apparently less than truthful '' in voluntarily turning over documents during an earlier search , according to San Francisco police inspector Ron Roth 's sworn affidavit . Roth also asserts that Bullock was a `` paid employee for the ADL . '' If so , by failing to pay taxes on $ 170,000 of income paid to Bullock , the ADL could face a total of 48 felony counts , according to court papers . The ADL may also face felony charges for illegally obtaining confidential information from police computers . As for errors : The ADL was founded in Chicago , and moved to New York in 1947 . But it was an original tenant in the San Francisco building shown in the _Voice_ photo , moving out a few months ago . I never wrote that an `` ADL leader was deeply involved in the [ Pollard ] Israeli spy operation . '' I reported that Pollard himself made the charge . And in court papers , Pollard 's own lawyer said that the wife of Pollard 's handler worked for the ADL . If I have a bias , it is on the side of the First and Fourth Amendments .

I have attempted to gather as many case histories as possible to find some estimate of success and risk . The number of replies probably shows how rare this modification is but give the impression that success rates may be higher than the previous 80 % estimate . 24 of 24 machines were able to run at 25 mhz when no add on boards were present . This is not a scientific survey but it is the best we have to work with . Thanks to all who contributed to this poll . Issues : Speed ) 25 mhz to 27.5 mhz appears to be the norm for machines without add on cards . All reported machines were able to use 25 mhz as long as no add on cards were present . Several Apple Nubus cards were in use . No machine with the Nubus adapter was able to go faster than 25 mhz . One was n't even able to achieve 25 mhz with the Nubus adapter in place At speeds of 32 and 33 mhz , the startup sound is distorted and hi density floppy disk problems have been reported . Note : Unless specifically listed below , machines were not tested with a higher speed clock to failure . Hence , the 25 mhz operational machines may well work at higher speeds . Damage ) One user reported pulling out the plating of one pad . This was repaired and the machine is operational . One other reported pulling the pin out of the original clock oscillator during desoldering .

The differential arrival time techinique requires interplanetary baselines to get good positions . The differential arrival at the eight detectors differ by 10 's of nanoseconds . This is smaller than BATSE 's microsecond timing capabilities . BATSE , Ulysses , and Mars Obsverver are used for this technique . Each BATSE detector does not have a full sky field of view . The sensitivity of each detector decreases with increasing angle of incidence . The burst position on the sky is determined by comparing the count rates in different detectors . Pat

Carpenter ) writes : > > > I 'm wondering if it 's possible to use radio waves to measure the > > distance between a transmitter ( s ) and receiver ? > > Yes . It 's called RADAR . Well , actually not quite . Both Radar and Radio-Altimeters measure distances by measuring the time required to transmit a signal , then receive its reflection from a target . Radar generally uses pulses , while Radio Altimeters use either pulses or a modulated continuous-wave transmission . In the case of the latter , highly accurate distance measurement can be made . As an example , the original Bendix ALA-52 Radio Altimeter was accurate to 1/8 foot at 2500 feet altitude . Note , however that this is a different method of measuring than the poster originally asked about . The problem with gaining accurate measurements between a transmitter and a seperate receiver is that you need a highly accurate time base which starts at the receiver at the exact instant the transmitter triggers . This can not be wire connected , since radio waves will actually travel faster in free-space ( air , in this case ) than wire ( the difference is called the velocity factor of the cable ) . So you need to resort to a common timebase that is automatically corrected for distance , etc . Something like a PLL connected to a GPS receiver should do the trick , triggering both the transmitter and receiver simultaneously . Sound expensive ? Not too bad , but plan on spending a few bucks in both equipment and effort . Why not go to a different method ? Surveyors use a laser-light system where again the reflection time is measured . Why not try this ? ( Sounds like something a P.E . should know about anyway ; - ) . > > Seems to me that you should be able to measure the signal strength > > and determine distance . This would be for short distances ( 2000 ft ) , > > and I would need to have accuracy of 6 inches , or so . This is actually highly inaccurate , since the power output of a transmitter varies from unit to unit , there are variances in the antenna and transmission line , and the receiver may also vary , both from unit to unit , and the same unit over time . You would need to continuously calibrate the entire system . With the radio altimeter this is also done , but since everything is located at one place , it is much easier to do . Note especially that the time base for the R.A. receiver and transmitter is one unit also ... > Depends on the environment : in a static environent such as a waveguide yes , in > a dynamic environment ( with objects moving about ) the multipath kills this > concept . Nope . FM capture effect says that the strongest signal wins . That is , unless the two interfering signals are seperated by more than 3 db in signal strength . This is the one problem that makes altimeters inaccurate at very low altitudes . Signals bouncing off runways tend to be VERY strong ... > > What frequencies would be best for this ? Or does matter ? As high as possible to eliminate outside influence , and also to enhance attenuation of multipath signals . Radio Altimeters typically use frequencies around 4 GHz .

Just curious . > the last arab country was syria . but not all of them > migrated due to the jewish state economical and > securital dilemma ! I have no idea what this guy means but the Syrian Jews are not allowed to leave Syria because Assad welshed on his promise and is not letting them go . Israel has nothing to do with it . As for the other Arab countries there are still small communities left in some Arab countries . Morocco has the largest group I think comprising perhaps just over a thousand ( but I have lost the exact figure . Maybe someone will be so kind as to post it ) . There are communities left in Yemen ( which went to the polls yesterday in what might appear to be a free-ish election ) , Algeria ( this is a tiny group , a couple of leftist intellectuals I think ) , of course Syria and Lebannon . The circumstances of the departure of the Jews from various Arab countries is controversial in some cases - like Iraq - and I do not want to get into a dispute about it . Egypt expelled most of its community outright . Most of the French North African Jews left rather than face Independence . I think that Moroccans might have been encouraged by some AntiSemitic acts but I am not sure . Someone else around here will know for sure . There are claims that Israeli intellegence officers spread rumours around Algeria that the Jews would not be welcome but this is probably just propaganda . It would take a very stupid person not to realise the benefits of a move to France ( as most did ) or to Israel . Yemeni Jews were airlifted to Israel . Those left were rumoured to have another airlift last year but I heard nothing about it so I guess it was just a rumour . Any I left out except Iraq ?

Two things to watch for : In Germany ( and I think the same holds for Sweden ) only some of the connections can handle tone dialing , so make sure the phone can be set to pulse dialing . In Sweden , the ' 0 ' is the first digit and all other digits are pushed `` down '' by one position ; this makes dialing ( and in the process converting numbers ) an interesting task . Otherwise , it is technically no problem to connect a foreign phone to either the German or Swedish phone system . OTOH neither you nor I would ever try that , as it is of course illegal . As the phone uses DTMF dialing , which by some magic all telecom operators seems to have agreed on , this is a complete non-issue . I do n't think there are any switches in Sweden that ca n't handle DTMF dialing . Most switches are now digital and thoses that are n't have been retrofitted with `` magic fingers '' that converts from DTMF to pulse dialing .

We have reached the point in our society when there are certain crimes that are so heinous that to merely be accused with them one is automaticly considered guilty and deemed not to have any natural rights much less civil rights . Among these are drug abuse , sexual perversion , and political incorrectness . Today Billary accused Koresh of having SEX with infants . He had been accused of a number of differing crimes ( inconsistantly ) over the last two months , but this is the first time I have heard that one . I had heard child abuse but this is somewhat stronger . It is fairly obvious that Koresh was hiding behind the children ; and ironicly considering his apocalyptic dread , believed enough in the American People's inherent goodness to believe he was protected . It is truly amazing that all these people who 60 days ago had never heard of the Branch Davidian now believe that he was suicidal , crazy , a child abuser and a immenant danger to others based solely on what the Government spokespersons had said . Remember that these people have an awful lot to loose if it is found that they have screwed up . But they do n't have as much to lose as David Koresh and his followers lost .

Big deal . If you are a legitimate law enforcement agent and have a legitimate wiretap order , you just listen in on the line for 10 minutes , get the serial number , and then take the order and go to the escrow agencies . If you notice the criminal is now using a different phone instrument , take your still-valid wiretap order to the escrow agency with the new serial number . ( This provides opportunities for abuse by law enforcement , but thats not what we are discussing right now . ) I oppose Clipper , but the mechanics here are simple and easy to understand .

I will wimp out and admit that I never liked the metaphor of Jesus `` paying '' for our sins in the sense that many Christians accept as literal . The point is that God understands the suffering we go through , not just intellectually like when we watch the Somalians on TV , but _really_ understands , He can `` feel '' our pain . This fact is manifested by Jesus ' life . We can argue that someone in history might have suffered more than Jesus , we can think of more horrible torture than crucifixion , we can think of cases of betrayal and fruitless effort leading to worse despair , but the main point is that Jesus is in the trenches with us , He is in everyone , whatever I do to the least of humanity I do to Him , and whatever I do for the least of humanity I do for Him . Now , to reconcile this with the existence of hell is beyond my capabilities , but that was n't my goal . > I 'd be surprised to see the moderator let this one through , Thankfully our moderator is surprising . > but I seriously want a reasonable explanation for this .

From : simon @ giaeb.cc.monash.edu.au Subject : Virtues of Purity , Modesty and innocence Organization : Monash University , Melb. , Australia . Lines : 154 Heres a nice story to help explain the virtues of purity , innocence and modesty , and their importance . The Most Beautiful Virtues This story is an excerpt taken from The Basket of Flowers by Johann Christoph von Schmid In a certain little market town , over a hundred years ago , there lived an upright and intelligent man named Jacob Rede . He was married to a most virtuous young woman and they lived happily in a humble home which was in the midst of a large , beautiful val- ley . After living many , happy years together , Jacob 's wife died , leaving him alone with only one friend ... his daughter Mary . Even as a child Mary was uncommonly pretty ; but as she grew in years , her piety , her innocence , her modesty and her unfeigned kindne ss towards all she came in contact with , gave to her beauty a rare and peculiar charm . Her face was lighted up with a look of such indescribable goodness , that it seemed almost as though one looked upon an angel . Mary 's greatest delight was the beautiful garden and her favour- ite flowers were the violet , the lily and the rose . Jacob loved to point to them as emblems of the virtues most becoming to her gender . When she once , early in March brought the first violet to him and joyfully called upon him to admire it , he said : Let the modest violet , my dear Mary , be to you an image of humil- ity and of the benevolence that does good in secret . It clothes itself in the tender colours of modesty ; it prefers to bloom in retired grots ; it fills the air with its fragrance while remain- ing hidden beneath the leaves . May you also , my dear Mary , be like the retiring violet , avoiding vain display , not seeking to attract the public eye , but preferring ever to do good in quietude and peace . One morning when the roses and lilies were in full bloom and the garden appeared in its richest array , Jacob said to his daughter , as he pointed out a beautiful lily , which was beaming in the morning sun : Let the lily my dear child , be to you the emblem of purity . Look how beautiful , how pure and fair it is ! The whi- test linen is as nothing compared with the purity of its petals : they are like the snow . Happy the maiden whose heart is as pure and as free from stain . But the purest of all colours is also the hardest -5- to preserve pure . Easily is the petal of the lily soiled ; touch it but carelessly or roughly and a stain is left behind . In the same way , a word or a thought may stain the purity of innocence ! Then pointing to a rose he said : Let the rose my dear Mary , be to you an emblem of modesty . More beautiful than the colour of the rose is the blush that rises to the cheek of a modest girl . It is a sign that she is still pure of heart and innocent in thought . Happy is the maiden whom the suggestion of a thought that is indelicate , will cause to blush , as she is thus put on her guard against the approach of danger . The cheeks which readily blush will remain for a long time with their roseate hue , while those which fail to blush at the least indelicacy of thought will soon become pale and wan , and go before their time to the grave . '' Among the many fruit trees that adorned the garden there was one that was prized above all the others . It was an apple tree , not much larger than a rose bush , and stood by itself in the middle of the garden . Mary 's father had planted it the day that she was born and every year it bore a number of beautiful apples . Once it blossomed earlier than usual and with unusual luxuriance . The tree was one mass of blossom . Mary was so delighted with it that she went every morning as soon as she was dressed to look at it . Once , when it was in full bloom , she called to her father and said : Look father , how beautiful ! Was there ever such a lovely mingling of red and white ? The whole tree looks like one huge bunch of flowers ! The next morning she hastened into the garden to feast her eyes once more upon the tree . But what was her grief to see that the frost had nipped it and destroyed all its flowers . They were all become brown and yellow and when the sun came forth in its strength they withered and fell to the ground . Mary wept bitter tears at the sight . Then said the father : Thus , does sinful pleasure destroy the bloom of youth . Oh my child , never cease to remember how dreadful it is to be seduced from the path of right ! Behold in the example of the apple tree an image of what would happen if you were to wander from the way - if the hopes your conduct hitherto has raised in my heart should vanish , not merely for a day or year , but for life . Ah , then how much more bitter would be the tears which I would shed over your lapse from virtue than those which now course down your cheeks ! Life would have no joys for me : with tears in my eyes I should -6- go down sorrowfully to my grave . As he spoke , the tears stood in his eyes ; Mary was deeply moved , and the words he uttered made so profound an impression upon her mind that she never forgot them . Under the eyes of a father so loving and wise , and amid the flowers of her garden , Mary grew daily in stature and intelli- gence - blooming as a rose , pure as a lily and retiring as a violet , and as full of promise as a tree laden with blossom . Happy was the old man at all times to behold how plenteously the fruits of his garden rewarded his diligent toil ; but with how much more happiness and content did he mark the gracious effect produced upon the heart and mind of his beloved daughter by his pious teaching and example . Jacob plucked several roses and lilies , tied them together in a bunch and gave them to Mary with the words : The lily and the rose , sister flowers as they are , belong the one to the other ; both incomparable in their beauty , they are ren- dered still more lovely by being together . In the same way my dear child are innocence and modesty twin sisters of virtue and can not be separated The greatest and most powerful guardian of purity is the thought of the presence of God -- Internet : simon @ giaeb.cc.monash.edu.au Viva Cristo Rey ! !

Zoroaster is far older than Daniel . If anything , one could claim that , in a sense , Daniel is a descendant of Zoroaster ; as Daniel , though being Hebrew , has assimilated into Zoroastrianism and has successfully introduced the religion into the Tanakh of Judaism . [ However , the majority of the book is in Hellenistic Aramaic ( not Babylonian Aramaic ) and only has Kethuvim or Writing status . ] Ref : Encyclopedia of Religion , Mircea Eliade : DANIEL , or , in Hebrew , Daniyye ' l ; hero of the biblical book that bears his name . Daniel is presented as a Jew in the Babylonian exile who achieved notoriety in the royal court for his dream interpretations and cryptography and for his salvation from death in a lion 's pit . He also appears in the last chapters of the book as the revealer of divine mysteries and of the timetables of Israel's restoration to national-religious autonomy . As a practitioner of oneiromancy in the court , described in Daniel 1-6 ( written in the third person ) , Daniel per- forms his interpretations alone , while as a visionary-apocalyptist , in Daniel 7-12 ( written in the first person ) , he is in need of an angel to help him decode his visions and mysteries of the future . It is likely that the name Daniel is pseudonymous , a deliberate allusion to a wise and righteous man known from Ugaritic legend and earlier biblical tradition . ( Ez . 14:4,28:3 ) . The authorship of the book is complicated not only by the diverse narrative voices and content but by its language : Daniel 1:1-2:4a and 8-12 are written in Hebrew , whereas Daniel 2:4b-7:28 is in Aramaic . The language division parallels the subject division ( Daniel 1-6 concerns legends and dream interpretations ; 7-12 concerns apocalyptic visions and interpretations of older prophecies ) . The overall chronological scheme as well as internal thematic balances ( Daniel 2-7 is chiliastically related ) suggest an attempt at redactional unity . After the prefatory tale emphasizing the life in court and the loyalty of Daniel and some youths to their ancestral religion , a chronological ordering is discernable : a sequence from King Nebuchadrezzar to Darius is reported ( Dn . 7-12 ) . Much of this royal dating and even some of the tales are problematic : for example , Daniel 4 speaks of Nebuchadrezzar 's transformation into a beast , a story that is reported in the Qumran scrolls of Nabonidus ; Belshazzar is portrayed as the last king of Babylon , although he was never king ; and Darius is called a Mede who conquered Babylon and is placed before Cyrus II of Persia , although no such Darius is known ( the Medes followed the Persians , and Darius is the name of several Persian kings ) . Presumably the episodes of Daniel 2-6 , depicting a series of monarchical reversals , episodes of ritual observances , and reports of miraculous deliverances were collected in the Seleucid period ( late fourth to mid-second century BCE ) in order to reinvigorate waning Jewish hopes in divine providence and encourage steadfast faith . The visions of Daniel 7-12 , reporting events from the reign of Belshazzar to that of Cyrus II ( but actually predicting the overthrow of Seleucid rule in Palestine ) , were collected and published during the reign of Antiochus IV prior to the Maccabean Revolt , for it was then ( beginning in 168 BCE ) that the Jews were put to the test concerning their allegiance to Judaism and their ancestral traditions , and many refused to desecrate the statues of Moses and endured a martyr 's death for their resolute trust in divine dominion . All of the visions of Daniel dramatize this dominion in different ways : for example , via images of the enthronement of a God of judgment , with a `` son of man '' invested with rule ( this figure was interpreted by Jews as Michael the archangel and by Christians as Christ ) , in chapter 7 ; via zodiacal images of cosmic beasts with bizarre manifestations , as in chapter 8 ; or via complex reinterpretations of ancient prophecies , especially those of Jeremiah 25:9-11 , as found in Daniel 9-12 . The imagery of the four beasts in chapter 7 ( paralleled by the image of four metals in chapter 2 ) , representing four kingdoms to be overthrown by a fifth monarchy of divine origin , is one of the enduring images of the book ; it sur- vived as a prototype of Jewish and Christian historical and apocalyptic schemes to the end of the Middle Ages . The role and power of this imagery in the fifteenth and sixteenth century work of the exegete Isaac Abravanel , the scientist Isaac Newton , and the philosopher Jean Bodin and among the Fifth Monarchy Men of seventeenth century England , for example , is abiding testimony to the use of this ancient topos in organizing the chiliastic imagination of diverse thinkers and groups . The schema is still used to this day by various groups predicting the apocalyptic advent . The encouragement in the face of religious persecution that is found and propagandized in Daniel 11-12 contains a remarkable reinterpretation of Isaiah 52:13-53:12 , regarding the suffering servant of God not as all Israel but as the select faithful . Neither the opening stories about Daniel and the youths nor the final martyrological allusions advocate violence or revolt ; they rather advocate a stance of piety , civil disobedience , and trustful resignation . Victory for the faithful is in the hands of the archangel Michael , and the martyrs will be resurrected and granted astral immortality . Persumably the circles behind the book were not the same as the Maccabean fighters and may reflect some proto-Pharisaic group of hasidim , or pietists . The themes of resistance to oppression , freedom of worship , preservation of monotheistic integrity , the overthrow of historical dominions , and the acknowledgement of the God of heaven recur throughout the book and have served as a token of trust for the faithful in their darkest hour . ZARATHUSHTRA , founder of the religion know as Zoroastrianism or Mazdaism ( from Mazda or Ahura Mazda , the name of the god prophesied by Zarathushtra . ) The etymology and history of Zarathushtra , the Avestan and oldest form of the name , as uncertain , both in various Iranian languages and in related forms else- where . There may have been an Old Persian form , Zara-ushtra , from which the Greek form , Zoroastres , may be derived , and there may have existed an Old Iranian form , Zarat-ushtra , to which may be linked the Middle Iranian Zrdrwsht , several Middle Persian forms ( such as Zrtwsht ) , and the New Persian Zardusht . We can state with certainty only that the second half of the name , ushtra , means `` camel . '' The form Zoroaster , derived from the Greek Zoroastres , was used traditionally in European culture until the eighteenth century , when Zarathustra , closer to the original ( and as found in Nietzsche ) , came into common use after the rediscovery of the Avesta , the collection of sacred books of Zoroastrianism , and the resulting studies in Iranian philology . [ See Avesta . ] Notwithstanding the great and continued popularity of Zarathushtra , even in Western culture , the sources available to us are few , extremely fragmented , and heterogeneous . Our principle sources are the five Gathas ( `` songs '' ) , attributed to Zarathushtra himself and included in the Yasna section of the Avesta : Gatha Ahunavaiti ( Yasna 28-34 ) , Gatha Ushtavaiti ( Yasna 43-46 ) , Gatha Spentamainyu ( Yasna 47-50 ) , Gatha Vokukhshathra ( Yasna 51 ) , and Gatha Vashishtoishti ( Yasna 53 ) , the last of which was probably written after the prophet 's death . Other sources of considerable , albeit varying , importance are the Younger Avesta and the remaining Zoroastrian religious literature , in particular the Pahlavi texts of the ninth and tenth centures CE . Although the Achaemenid inscriptions ( sixth to fourth centures BCE ) never mention Zarathushtra , he is mentioned by some Greek sources of the time ( not , however , by Herodotus , who seems unaware of him ) . The Avesta does not provide any direct or explicit data concerning the true chronological history of Zarathushtra . But the text is useful in an indirect way , as it clearly implies that the environment in which Zoroastrianism arose was not that of Iran under the Medes or the Persians . The Greek sources , on the other hand , do provide some information concerning the time of Zarathushtra , although from a historical point of view they are unreliable . Some place him six thousand years before the Trojan War ( Xanthus of Lydia , Eudoxus of Cnidus , Hermippus , Hermodorus , Aristotle , Plutarch , Diogenes Laertius , and Pliny ) . The account by Xanthus of Lydia , however , has also been interpreted by some to mean six hundred , rather than six thousand , years before the expedition of Xerxes against Greece . This interpretation is favored by Diogenes Laertius , who makes reference to Xanthus , but although a few scholars ( A. S. Shabazi , Helmut Humbach ) have recently attempted to rehabilitate it under various pretexts , it is generally rejected . Although the historical value of the Greek sources is negligible , they are nonetheless important in that they show that the millenarian doctrine of history of the cosmos had already been developed in Iran by the Achaemenid period , as the above account would seem to demonstrate . They also show that by this time Zarathushtra was already seen as an almost mythical figure , one from an extremely distant past . All of this leads to the conclusion that the prophet could not have belonged to a historical period contemporary with , or even close to , that of the Achaemenids . Later Zoroastrian sources , the Pahlavi texts , do provide an absolute chrono- logy for Zarathushtra , one that was also accepted by some Arab authors . Accord- ing to these sources , Zarathushtra lived 300 or 258 years before Alexander . Again , scholars are divided on the validity of the chronology ; some view it as historically reliable while others believe that it is devoid of historical justification . The most convincing arguments , however , seem to support the latter position . The figure of 258 years is accurate only on the surface because it represents , in fact , the more general one of 300 , which was employed by Sasanid propagandists to locate Zarathushtra 's lifetime roughly around the beginning of Iranian domination . For a number of reasons connected with complex problems inherent in the Iranian chronology , there was also a desire on the part of the Sasanid propagandists to avoid any millenarian threat . In this context , Zarathushtra , whom tradition places early in the ninth millennium after the beginning of the cosmos , converted Vishtaspa at the age of forty-two , and Vishtaspa 's conversion was viewed by some as the beginning of the millennium ( thus explaining the double date of 300 and 258 years before Alexander ) . Given the unreliability of the few available sources , we are forced to reconstruct an absolute chronology on the basis of other elements , principally on the contention that Zarathushtra must have lived a few centuries before Cyrus the Great , Cambyses , and Darius , as there is no mention in the Avesta of the great political achievements that took place in western Iran in the middle of the first millennium BCE . Nor is there any mention of the history of that period , which was to lead Iran to a position of such predominance . At the same time , for a number of reasons , going back much further in history would not be justified . Consequently , the traditionally accepted theory of placing Zara- thushtra around the beginning of the first millennium BCE appears to be the most legitimate . As to Zarathushtra 's land of origin , many scholars agree , on the basis of valid arguments , that he must have come from eastern Iran . Some have held that he was a Mede , largely because of a late Iranian tradition linking Zarathushtra with Azerbaijan , but also because of linguistic reasons , based on the language of the Avesta . This hypothesis , however , should be discarded , as we can suppose , both on historical and linguistic grounds , that Zarathushtra came from the east , even though we do not know precisely from which region . There is a considerable variety of opinion on this particular matter , including the improbable view that he came from Chorasmia , or present-day Khorezm , or from a wider Chorasmian region , reaching as far as the oases of Merv and Herat . Most likely , however , Zarathushtra 's land of origin is somewhere in the vast area stretching from the Hindu Kush mountain range to the more southern regions of Bactria and Arachosia ( modern Qandahar ) , as well as Drangiana ( the area of lake Helmand ) . It would thus be located in what is now Afghanistan or in the border regions of Iran . Zarathushtra himself tells us that he belonged to the priestly caste ( Yasna 33.6 ) . He was a zaotar ( cf . Sanskrit hotr ) , that is , a priest belonging to a specific group connected with a school that produced very elaborate and learned religious poetry . Even in the so-called Younger Avesta he is described as an athravan ( Yashts 13.94 ) , a more general term encompassing the entire priestly caste . To enter it he had undergone a long and rigid training , which he used to lend dignity ( as in the Gathas ) to the contents of his new message , the product of a great and original ethical mind . Zarathushtra also belongs to that venerable priestly tradition , linking India to Iran in another way , by centering his teachings on the praise of the ashavan , or `` possessor of asha , '' that is , the one who , as in the Vedic rtavan , seeks truth and masters it , thus becoming ashavan in this life - almost an initiate - and blessed after death . Any good follower of such teachings seeks the `` vision of asha , '' just as those chosing the right path in Vedic India aspired to the '' vision of the Sun , '' a manifestation of rta . Behind these concepts and this language lies the great tradition of `` Aryan mysticism , '' that is , of Indo-Iranian mysticism . Zarathushtra 's greatness , however , does not lie in his having belonged to a particular religious tradition . Rather , it lies in the innovation and strength of his message , which was in itself a break in the tradition , one that force- fully and effectively introduced two great revolutionary ideas : dualistic monotheism ( the Wise Lord who fathers two twin spirits , the beneficent and the evil ) ; and the expectation of a transfiguration ( Av. , Frashokereti ; Pahl. , Frashgird ) of life and existence . [ See Frashokereti ] Both his monotheistic and dualistic ideas and his particular soteriological doctrine deeply separate Zarathushtra 's teachings from the Indo-Iranian tradi- tions of his upbringing . They exemplify his rebellion against a formalistic and ritualistic religion that did not provide adequate answers to the problem of evil . Because of his basic tenets , Zarathushtra , who advocated an inward religiosity and the right of the individual to resist the imperatives of tradi- tion , can be numbered among the greatest of religious figures . Another original facet of Zarathushtra 's message , one that is not easy to understand but which , however , holds the key to a deeper understanding of the complex intellectual and poetic structure of the Gathas , is the doctrine of the Amesha Spentas , the `` beneficent immortals . '' These are spiritualizations of the abstract notions of good thought , best truth , desirable power , bounteous devotion , wholeness , and immortality , all of which operate according to a system of interrelations and correlations and can simultaneously be the manifestations of a divinity and of human virtue . [ See Amesha Spentas . ] Other than the names of his father , Pourushaspa ( `` possessing gray horses '' ) , and of his mother , Dughdova ( `` one who has milked '' ) , we know almost nothing of Zarathushtra 's life . A late Pahlavi text also give the names of four brothers . According to tradition , Zarathushtra left home at the age of twenty , and at thirty he was subject to a revelation , both through an intense and powerful inspiration and through a vision . Only after ten years had passed , however , did he succeed in converting a cousin of his , Maidhyoimah , to his beliefs . He was strongly opposed in his native land by kavis , karapans , and usijs , priestly groups associated with traditional teachings and practices . This hostility caused him to leave his region ( Yasna 46:1 ) and to seek refuge at the court of Kavi Vishtaspa , a ruler who had been converted to the new religion together with his wife , Hutaosa , when the prophet , according to tradition , was forty-two years old . We also know the name of a son , Isat Vastra ( `` desiring pastures '' ) , and of three daughters born of his first wife , as well as the names of two more sons , Urvatatnara ( `` commanding men '' ) and Hvarecithra ( `` sun-faced '' ) , born of his second wife , Hvovi , a member of the influential Hvogva ( `` possessing good cattle '' ) family . Two other figures belonging to the Hvogva family are mentioned : Frashaoshtra and Jamaspa , the former as Hvovi 's father , and the latter as the husband of the third daughter of the prophet , Pouruchista ( `` very thoughtful '' ) , whose wedding is celebrated in the fifth hymm in the Gathas ( Yasna 53 ) . Again , according to tradition , Zarathushtra died at the age of seventy-seven . He was assassinated by a karapan , a priest of the old religion , who belonged to the Tuirya tribe and was called Tur i Bradres ( his name is known only in the Pahlavi form ) . The paucity of information on the prophet 's life is compensated by a tradi- tion , rich in legendary detail , that arose through the centuries in Zoroastrian communities . The main texts documenting the tradition are the seventh book of the Denkard , a Pahlavi work dating from the ninth century CE , as well as passages from other Pahlavi texts and a New Persian work from the thirteenth century , the Zarathusht-nama ( Book of Zarathushtra ) , written by Zaratusht-i Bahram-i Pazhdu . Mythical and ritual elements prevail in the later legends about Zarathushtra , which idealize him into a symbol and make him the archetype of the perfect man . Zarathushtra 's great popularity in the ancient world continued throughout the Renaissance until the Enlightenment . During the Classical and Hellenistic periods he was viewed as a wise man , a typical representative of an `` alien wisdom , '' a master of the secrets of heaven and earth , a seer , astrologer , psychologist , and wonder worker . Pythagorean thinkers went so far as to see the influence of Zarathushtra on Pythagoras himself , and the Academicians always openly admired the Persian thinker who founded the school of the Magi and advocated a doctrine of dualism . Earliest Christianity viewed Zarathushtra as a precursor of the Christian faith , one who not only prophesied , as had the biblical prophets , the advent of the Messiah but also predicted the supernatural sign of his coming , the star that was to appear in the East and guide the three Magi to the manger in Bethlehem . [ See Magi . ] This Christian interpretation is derived from the Zoroastrian doctrine of the Saoshyant , the Savior of the Future . [ See Saoshyant . ] Later , however , religious struggles arose during the Sasanid empire in Persia ( third to seventh centuries CE ) , which linked the spread of Christianity with the Roman empire . Zarathushtra 's popularity in the Christian world began to decline . The Iranian prophet , who had been praised often by the gnostic schools and who had been seen by Mani as one of the three great messengers from the past , was now seen , instead , as a leader of imposture and heresy , a teacher of the diabolic arts of witchery . But during the Renaiss- ance and the Enlightenment , European cultures reverted to the image of Zara- thushtra that had come down through Classical and Hellenistic antiquity . He was viewed , once again , as a great and wise man , as the author of the _Chaldean Oracles_ and probably inventor of Qabbalah , as a teacher of astrology , as a possible bridge between Christianity and Platonism , and , at times ( as in Voltaire ) , as a symbol of non-Christian wisdom . After Western philology rediscovered Zarathushtra during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries , Friedrich Nietzsche , in an intentional paradox , gave the name Zarathustra to the hero of his work _Also sprach Zarathustra_ ( 1883- 1892 ) . Nietzsche saw the Iranian prophet as the first to have discovered the true motive force underlying all things , that is , the eternal struggle between good and evil . [ See also Zoroastrianism ]

Paul while led by the holy spirit was human and could err .

I find it disturbing that the modern church spends its energy trying to stamp out something that CHRIST did n't consider worth a single word of condemnation .

And `` valuable to his team '' was not , and should not be , considered synonymous with `` best '' .

When this collission occurs , kinetic energy is translated into heat , the log degrades , gets scraped up , and other energy translaions occur . The distribution of damage to the log depends on the shape of the log . However , to a very small virus in a mite on the head of a termite in the center of the log , the shock waves from the collissions would appear uniformly random in direction . This is my theory for GRB . They are evidence of our universe interacting with other universes ! Why not ! Makes just as much sense as the GRB coming from the Oort cloud ! The log theory of universes ca n't be ruled out ! Of course , I 'm a layman in the physics world . You physicists out there , Tell me about this ! ! ! !

Personally , if the fire was set ( by either side ) , I wonder about the timing . If Koresh & Co. set the fires , why wait through six hours of wall-bashing and tear-gassing before starting ; was there anything `` new '' that happened just around that point ? Similarly , if the FBI were going to torch the place ( and fake it , of course ) , why wait so long , wouldn't it be more `` reasonable '' to believe the BD 's would set the fire early after the assault began ? The most plausible ( to me ) explaination is that of an accidental starting of the fire by the tanks . Among other things , I say that because I was listening to the radio when the fire started and the reporter ( watching from a distance , of course ) said that it looked like at least one of the tanks had penetrated farther into the building than previously . Specifically , he said that one tank apparently was halfway ( half of the tank 's lenght ) into the building where it previously had only been penetrating a few feet . reserving judgement , -Aaron
From : ldiel @ dante.nmsu.edu ( Leisa Diel ) Subject : Info needed Organization : New Mexico State University , Las Cruces , NM Lines : 58 Ok , let me see if I can get all this out concisely . I am on an information gathering venture regarding the various expressions of Christianity/churches there are . My husband and I come from very different , but completely Christian backgrounds . I was a Lutheran when I met him and he was a born and raised Church of Christ member . At first I agreed with a lot of what the C of C was about , I wanted to move from the liturgical based Lutheran church to something a little more Biblical based . However over the last year , I 've been regretting changing to the Church of Christ for a number of reasons - for one thing I am not a fundamentalist and believe that a few things in the Bible are socio-cultural in nature and do n't relate to the Christian doctrine . One of my sorest spots is the role of women . I believe that through Mary and other women , Chris validated women as worthy disciples - but in the C of C the writings of Paul are taken without exception and I am told that I am not an equal partner in my marriage but the lesser member , I am to submit to my husband in all things ( if I hear that verse one more time ... . ) and I am not to take an active role in anything which might be construed as putting me in authority over men ( ie leading prayers , conducting Bible studies etc ) . The last straw was when the Elders at our church came down on one of our college groups because it was all-women and they wanted a man to lead the study . Also my husband and I really resent the way everyone at our church feels that if you are n't a conservative republican - you are n't a REAL Christian ( I got told that nobody who voted for Clinton should call themselves a Christian ) . Hence we are subjected during the service to long prayers calling for things we flatly dont agree with . We are also do n't agree with the C of C 's dread of any new `` movement '' being led by the young people . So , we have been church hunting with NO success . I want a reasonably biblical based church where women are viewed as whole people no matter what their calling ( C of C really looked down on career women ) . Christopher is looking for a church with deeply rooted religious convictions , with adult baptism and a church where the members still bring their Bibles to service . We are so confused here and we 're drifting around trying to find a place where we both feel loved and can express our faith honestly and without reservation . If anyone can point us in a direction we 'd be thrilled ! I 'm afraid that it will be very hard for me to go back to C of C and even harder for me to stay churchless for long . any responses would be welcome the diel family [ I would think somewhere in the Baptist spectrum you might find what you 're looking for . However the issue is probably more one of the flavor of the specific local churches in your area than the denomination -- Baptists cover quite a spectrum . Adult baptism sort of narrows your choices on the more liberal end of the spectrum . Historically that 's been associated with movements that have the character you 're trying to avoid . -- clh ]

Some think > it refers to lust , others pride , but who knows ? Whatever the > thorn was , apparently it was not compatible with Christianity , > yet does that make his epistles any less ? Paul mentions his `` thorn '' ( SKOLOPS , actually a sharp stake ) in 2 Corinthians 12:7-9 + And to keep me from being too elated by the abundance of + revelations , a thorn was given me in the flesh , a messenger of + Satan , to harass me , to keep me from being too elated . Three + times I besought the Lord about this , that it should leave me ; + but he said to me , `` My grace is sufficient for you , for my + power is made perfectr in weakness . '' He does not explain what it was , but it need not have been a moral problem . One guess is that Paul had a disorder of the eyes . He ordinarily dictated his letters , and then added a personal note and his signature . At the end of the letter to the Galatians , he says , '' See , I am writing in large letters with my own hand , '' or else , `` See what a long letter I have written with my own hand . '' If the former translation is adopted , it seems that Paul could not write in the small script of a practiced writer , but needed to make his letters larger , and this suggests eye problems . Again , he says to the Galatians ( 4:13-15 ) , + You know that it was because of a bodily ailment that I preached + the gospel to you at first ; and although my condition was a trial + to you , you did not scorn or despise me , but received me as an + angel of God ... . For I bear you witness that , if possible , you + would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me . Perhaps this last line means simply , `` You would have done anything for me , not withholding your most precious possessions ( your eyes ) . '' But in that case , we would expect some wording like , `` If I had needed them . '' `` If it were possible '' sounds as though the bodily ailment was connected with his eyes . William Barclay , in his volume on Acts , makes a more specific suggestion . Before Paul preached in the highlands of Galatia , he had been preaching in the coastal areas of Asia Minor . If he had had a malarial attack while there , a doctor would have advised him to leave the low country and head for the hills . Malaria might well have given him both severe headaches and blurred vision . Yours , James Kiefer

If it is a master , then a second jumper indicates if a slave is present . These must be set correctly according to each drive 's manufacturers spec- ification .

From : jca2 @ cec1.wustl.edu ( Joseph Charles Achkar ) Subject : Blues shutout Hawks again , lead series 3-0 Nntp-Posting-Host : cec1 Organization : Washington University , St. Louis MO Lines : 118 4/23/93 BLUES SHUTOUT HAWKS AGAIN , LEAD SERIES 3-0 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - It was a great atmosphere last night at the St. Louis Arena as Joseph and the Blues shutout the Hawks for the second consecutive game . People were cheering the Blues long before face-off time , and they kept going for the entire game . My friends and I went out celebrating until the early morning hours with some of the players . Here 's a game summary from the St. Louis Post-Disptach . Enjoy ... By Dave Luecking Of The Post-Dispatch Staff : At 10:24 p.m. Friday night , The Arena crowd of 17,965 paid homage to Blues goalie Curtis Joseph . The fans began bowing , their arms extended , taking the the lead from a fan who held a sign that read `` Only God Saves More Than Joseph . '' It was a fitting tribute to Joseph , who has brought the Blues to the verge of a surprising sweep . Joseph recorded his second successive shutout Friday , blanking the Blackhawks 3-0 in Game 3 of the Norris Division semifinals and giving the Blues a 3-0 lead in the best-of-seven series . The Blackhawks have n't scored against Joseph since the 8:51 mark of the second period of Game 1 . Joseph has shut out the Blackhawks for 151 minutes 9 seconds , a Blues record . Jacques Plante held the previous record of 146:28 , set in the first round of the 1969 playoffs against the Philadelphia Flyers , one of only two series the Blues have sweeped in their history . The Blues can wrap up their first sweep since 1969 with a victory in Game 4 , a nationally televised game that begins at noon Sunday . The Blues have had only two sweeps in franchise history , both in 1969 , when they swept Philadelphia and Los Angeles en route to the Stanley Cup finals . The shutout Friday was easier than on Wednesday in Game 2 when Joseph had to make 47 saves . This time , the Blues held the shots down to 34 , and the Blackhawks could n't touch Joseph . Well , they touched Joseph , numerous times , shoving him and pushing him at every opportunity to try to get him off his game . But Joseph and the Blues were unfazed , dishing out their own punishment along the way . The Blues ' grinders -- Bob Bassen , Rich Sutter , Kevin Miller and Dave Lowry -- wore down the Blackhawks , taking the visitors from Chicago off their game . The grinders set the stage for the glamour boys , the gifted playmakers and scorers , who made the most of their opportunities . Craig Janney , Brett Hull and Nelson Emerson scored , getting one goal in each period . Hull assisted on Janney 's first-period power play goal after two unwise Chicago penalties . Checker Miller set up Hull 's goal in the second period , and rookie Denny Felsner assisted for Emerson , who scored at 16:44 of the final period . Blues fans jumped to their feet in celebration of that goal and began yelling `` Sweep . Sweep . Sweep . '' They also taunted Chicago goalie Ed Belfour `` Bell-Four . Bell-Four . '' They also chanted `` Na , na-na-na , hey-hey good bye . '' Such talk is a tad premature . There 's still one game left , but the Blues are on a roll . They have the Blackhawks on their heels . The Blues set the tone early on Friday with two crunching hits in the first minute of play . Rich Sutter leveled Bryan Marchment , and Brendan Shanahan dumped Steve Smith at center ice . Chicago tried to retaliate , but Troy Murray 's decision to run into Joseph backfired . Referee Dan Marouelli gave him a roughing penalty . The Blues did n't get a shot on goal on the power play , and they survived a scare after Chicago killed the penalty when Rick Zombo gave the puck away to Steve Larmer . Joseph stopped Larmer 's shot and everything else Chicago threw at him in the first period . The 'Hawks ignored the scouting report on Joseph about shooting high and continued to shoot low , where Joseph 's butterfly style is deadly . Rookie Bret Hedican picked up three consecutive penalties midway through the period -- two for hooking and one for holding -- but Chicago got only two shots on goal , as many as Miller . The Blues ' penalty killer twice stole the puck and just missed on good scoring chances against Belfour . Marouelli began calling penalties on the Blackhawks to even things up . He caught Brent Sutter hooking Shanahan four seconds after Hedican 's third penalty . He called Marchment for elbowing Janney along the boards at 14:58 , and gave the Blues a two-man advantage 1:07 later when Christian Ruuttu slashed Shanahan . The Blues worked around the puck on the ensuing power play , and Hull got it where he likes it -- in the high slot . Hull 's shot hit Belfour 's right shoulder , and the puck bounced precariously close to the goal line . Belfour dived back to cover , but the puck squirted loose to Janney , who poked it into the net at 16:53 for his first goal of the playoffs . The Blues continued their relentless hitting as the period ended , and the Blackhawks lost their composure . Joe Murphy tripped Ron Wilson with two seconds remaining in the period , and after time had expired Smith upset the Blues by shooting the puck into the Blues ' bench . Chris Chelios made a move toward Joseph as the teams left the ice , and Marouelli slapped him with a 10-minute misconduct . Chicago survived the Blues' power play , but the loss of Chelios hurt . He did n't return until the midway point of the period , and within three minutes of his return , Hull had increased the Blues ' lead to 2-0 , deflecting in Miller 's crisp pass . Try as they might , the Blackhawks could n't get to Joseph , who stopped everything they could throw at him . He stopped 12 shots in the second period and 13 more in the third . Chicago also hit the goalpost twice . Emerson 's goal put the game away . He went hard to the net and redirected Felsner 's pass . % * % * % * % ** % * % % * % * % * % * % * % * % * % * % * % * % * % * % * % * % * % * % * % * % * % * % * % * % * % * % * % * % * % * % * % * * __ ______________ ____________________________________ % % \ \_ ) ____________/ A L L E Z L E S B L U E S ! ! ! * * \ __________/ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ % % \ ________/ * * \ _______/ Joe Ashkar % % \ \ Contact for the Blues * * \ \ SAINT LOUIS jca2 @ cec1.wustl.edu % % ( ___ ) BLUES * * % * % * % * % * % * % * % * % * % * % * % * % * % * % * % * % * % * % * % * % * % * % * % * % * % * % * % * % * % * % * % * % * % * % * % * %

For what it 's worth , I got my can in three days from Chaparral . That's UPS ground from CA to UT , YMMV . The stuff seems to work , and it doesn't attract grundge like PJ-1 Blue does . I gave it the acid test , a full day 's worth of breaking in the Quadracer 's new paddle tires down at the sand dunes . If there 's anything wet & stickey it will be coated with sand at the end of the day , but the chain looked pretty clean . As far as mail-order goes , if Chaparral has it in stock ( and they can tell you if it 's in stock , or about how long it will take to back-order it if it 's not ) , I usually get it in three days . Competition Accessories always seems to take a week or two to deliver . Motorcycle Accessory Warehouse also takes a week or two , and after trying to buy some boots from them last week , I do n't think they actually stock anything . MAW was about $ 30 cheaper than Chaparral on Alpinestars Tech 7 boots , but on Monday I was hoping to get them by the end of the week , so I asked MAW a completely unreasonable question : `` Do you have them in stock ? '' The conversation went something like this : I need to know if you have some boots in stock . Do you want to pay with Visa or Mastercard ? I want to know if you have them in stock . Well , the computer does n't show anything , I 'd have to call the distributer to find out if we have them . So do you have them or not ? Do n't you understand what I 'm saying ? I have to call our distributer to find out if we have them in stock or not . Uh , right . So can you do it ? Yea , call me back in an hour , and ask for Phil . So an hour later Phil is n't there , but Mike says he 'll check , and call him back in half an hour . Half an hour later Mike is n't there either , but he left a note that says they 'll have them by the end of the month ( 3 weeks away ) . Screw it , the 30 bucks is n't worth the hassle . I called Chaparral and asked if they had them in stock : Ooh , Alpinestars ? Probably not , they are hard to keep in stock , but I 'll check . What size ? Size 10 . Let 's see , yes ! Size 10 , in blue & white , gray & white , black ... I 'll take the blacks ! This was about noon on Monday , they arrived Thursday morning . Once again , three days via UPS ground . I _like_ Chaparral . I 'm not completely down on MAW , they often have lower prices , but be prepared to wait . Oh , and if anyone 's in the market for sand tires and other ATV stuff , Scorcher seems like a good outfit , friendly , fast , had the tires I wanted in stock , and were cheaper than Chaparral too . -- Blaine Gardner @ Evans & Sutherland bgardner @ dsd.es.com

I do n't believe you , and I do n't believe your friend . Why ? Because DES is not known to have any known plaintext attacks readily availble . Unless your friend knows something and is keeping it secret , he was bullshitting you . Now , it IS possible that he noted a weakness in the *implementation* of the Kerberos protocol . For instance , using a weak RNG to generate keys might cut down on the keyspace ( not for the user keys -- for the other kind who 's name I ca n't remember ) . However , this is not what was claimed . You are claiming a general weakness in DES , which is not known to exist in the open literature . Do n't get me wrong -- DES is weaker than it should be .

Your lead is correct to pull down the bias to the series regulator base drive . In order to get the brick -wall , you need enough voltage gain on the current sensor . Normally a darlington on the current sensing resistor will be adequate , but for infinite gain.. use an op amp to sense the current releative to a stable voltage reference and use a driver to turn off the base bias on the series-pass transistor . Phase compensation may be necessary with this closed loop control system if yopu have more than 180 degrees phase shift in your feedabck circuit at unity gain OK ? ? dino @ inqmind.bison.mb.ca The Inquiring Mind BBS , Winnipeg , Manitoba 204 488-1607

Actually I am not sure you have understood what I have said . On several occasions a minor party has put up an Arab for a Cabinet position . That is the major party ( Labour in this case ) has agreed that a minor party can have so many seats and that party nominates an Arab for one . This is not acceptable to the major party which insists on the minor party appointing a Jew . The favours owed , deals done , have all been settled . What remains is exactly who is going to sit in Cabinet . The party that gets the seat wants an Arab but that is not acceptable . This *is* racism . It has nothing to do with politics at all .

While we are talking about this man I have included more of his testimony that Harry naturally does not use nor does Myths and Facts . I wonder why . No doubt he was lying right Harry ? `` The reason was mainly economic . That is to capture booty in order to maintain the bases which we had then established with very poor resources . The main idea , despite this , remained the conquest of the village by force of arms , something which was then unknown in the country , and became a turning point in Jewish military operations '' Yehuda Lapidot , Jabontinsky Archives Testimony `` Apart from the military discussion , the Lehi put forward a proposal to liqui- date the residents of the village after the conquest , in order to show the Arabs what happens when the IZL and the Lehi set out together on an operation , and for another main reason - it would cause a great uproar throughout the land and would be an important turning point in the course of the battles . The clear aim was to break the Arab morale and raise somewhat the morale of the Jewish commu- nity in Jerusalem , which had been hit hard time after time , especially recenctly by the desecration of Jewish bodies which fell into Arab hands '' Yehuda Lapidot , Jabotinsky Archives testimony as quoted by Yisrael Segal in `` The Deir Yassin File '' , published by Koteret Rashit 19th January 1983 So it was n't like the Holocaust more like Lidice - a warning , a punishment . Collective and inflicted on unarmed innocents just not as through . `` When it comes to prisoners , old people and children , there were differences of opinion , but the majority was for liquidation of all the men in the village and any other force that opposed us , whether it be old people , women or children Benzion Cohen Commander of the attack on Deir Yassin , ( J.A.T . ) Let me put in some words here a. premeditated b. murder What do you say about the eyewitness testimony of the man in command ? `` We had prisoners and before the retreat we decided to liquidate them . We also liquidated the wounded , as anyway we could not give them first aid . In one place about eighty Arab prisoners were killed after some of them had opened fire and killed one of the people who came to give them first aid . Arabs who dressed up as Arab women were also found , and so they started to shoot the women also who did not hurry to the area where the prisoners were concentrated '' ( J.A.T . ) Shooting prisoners , the wounded , as a warning to hurry ? Sounds VERY familiar to me , how about you ? Heard of other people other places doing these things ? `` In one case - the Zahran family - only one out of twenty five survived . In another house they caught the sixteen year old son Fuad . His mother was holding him . They killed him with a knife . The mother spent twenty years after that in a mental hospital . A young woman and her two year old baby were shot in the street . Their bodies were left there . They moved to the centre of the village and started to kill everybody they saw or heard , as soon as anybody opened his door . They were using bombs [ grenades ] , machine-guns , submachine-guns . My cousin escaped with bullet-holes in his clothes . One of the officers put his machinegun through a window and started shooting outwards , killing everybody who moved . They killed my uncle , Ali Hassan Zeidan , and my aunt Fatima . She heard him call 'help me ' . She ran to him and they killed her . Another neighbour Haj Yarah , heard some voices and came out . They killed him too . His son Muhammad , who was about seventeen , heard his father call him and went to the same place . They killed him . His mother heard her son cry for help . She ran out and they killed her . That was near my house . I saw this '' Muhammad Arif Sammour Funny how 'Myths and Facts ' does not see fit to include this too - after all if he is reliable enough to report casualties why not the actual events ? What do you say about this Harry ? `` In the exchange that followed four men were killed and a dozen were wounded.. ..by noon time the battle was over and the shooting had ceased . Although there was a calm , the village had not yet surrendered . The Irgun and Lehi men came out of hiding and began to 'clean ' the houses . They shot whoever they saw , women and children included , the commanders did not try and stop the massacre ... I pleaded with the commander to order his men to cease fire , but to no avail . In the meantime twenty five Arabs had been loaded on a truck and driven through Mahane-Yehuda and Zichron Yosef .

Organization : FWI , University of Amsterdam Lines : 35 NNTP-Posting-Host : ic.fwi.uva.nl Hi , I am running X11R4 on an IBM RS/6000 ( AIX 3.2 ) and X11R5 on a Sun4 ( SunOS 4.1 ) . Since I run X on both colour and black & white displays , I need different values for the same resource , so I want to use # ifdef COLOR in my application defaults files . However , cpp is only invoked by xrdb , and not when the resources are loaded on demand . Is there a proper solution to this ? So far , the only proper solution I 've come to think of , is to create 2 different files in my ~/app-defaults/ , say XTerm and XTerm-color , and set my XFILESEARCHPATH to either $ HOME/ % T/ % N or $ HOME/ % T/ % N-color . But that does not always seem to work ( e.g . executing a remote shell command without reading the .cshrc does not set XFILESEARCHPATH ) . Furthermore , I thought of using # include `` XTerm '' in XTerm-color . However , for resources in XTerm that I want to override in XTerm-color , things are different on both machines . On a Sun , the FIRST found resource is used ( i.e . the one from XTerm , the b & w one ) , while on an RS/6000 , the LAST found value is used ( i.e . the one from XTerm-color ) . What can I do about it ? I have one last question : for the specification of XFILESEARCHPATH , I can use % T , % N , % C and % S . % T stands for app-defaults , % N for the resource class , but what do % C and % S stand for ?

God is God . But all humans are sinners , thus all pre-Jesus humans should have been punished with death . We are n't punished with sin now , of course , because God has changed . He required a brutal , sadistic sacrifice of his own blood in order to allow us to sin without immediate death . > He can not tolerate the prescence of sin in His midst . Yet he does so now . He has changed . The sadistic murder of his own son has made him more tolerant of our sins . Besides , his `` midst '' is everywhere , so your statement is meaningless . He tolerates sin in Hell , which surely is in his midst as well . Also , given that he is all-knowing , he must have eternal knowledge of who will commit which sins , as well as when and where , so what does tolerance have to do with anything . All of this is absolute nonsense , unless your god is not indeed all-knowing and all-powerful , or unless he does n't take the personal interest in everyday affairs that you claim . > And the Israelites knew this !

You turn on your computer , it heats up , and everything expands . You turn it off , it cools off , and everything contracts . There is a limited number of cycles of this that any component can take before it fails . Modern electronics are much more robust in this respect than their predeccesors . In fact portable computers are designed with this in mind since the sleep function that extends battery life also greatly increaces the number of thermal cycles that occur . As a rule of thumb , if I am not going to use my computer ( and this includes the monitor ) in the next 4-6 hours , I turn it off ( I always dim the monitor when not in use to prolong the life of the phosphor ) . I tend to think that with the pace of technical innovation in the computer industry you should be much less concerned with the fatigue life of your equipment and more concerned with how long your particular architecture will be supported by hardware and software vendors . : '' ) Charles Kuehmann Northwestern University Steel Research Group

Alberto , you 've repeatedly misunderstood my postings . You are now making the exact point that I 've made several times but with a different definition of religion . You do n't not have to believe in the `` religious '' aspects of Judaism to be a Jew ( this would confine Judaism to be just a religion in the sense of a Christianity. ) . So , by converting out of Judaism , I do n't mean just not believing in the god of Judaism . I mean voluntarily removing yourself from the Jewish nation . I am an agnostic but still consider myself Jewish because of my cultural heritage . ( I admit that many religious jews would argue that I am not completely jewish because of my lack of faith , but Judaism is a religion of dissent and debate is n't it ? ) . The fact that one can opt to become Jewish simply by converting to Judaism makes the nation of the jewish people the *least* racist and most open nation . We have no quotas ! So I will once again make my point . Defining a member of the Jewish nation by religion ( not , as you say , religious belief ) is NOT racism . You come to your incorrect conclusion because you use a different definition for religion when you define the law of return and when you define judaism . -Adam Schwartz

( Memoirs of an American officer who witnessed the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people ) p. 361 ( seventh paragraph ) and p. 362 ( first paragraph ) . 'The most are inside houses . Come you and look . ' 'No , dammit ! My stomach isn't-' 'One is a Turkish officer in uniform . Him you must see . ' `` We were under those trees by the mosque , in an open space ... . ' I do n't believe you , '' I said , but followed to a nail-studded door . The man pushed it ajar , then spurred away , leaving me to check on the corpse . I thought I should , this charge was so constant , so gritted my teeth and went inside . The place was cool but reeked of sodden ashes , and was dark at first , for its stone walls had only window slits . Rags strewed the mud floor around an iron tripod over embers that vented their smoke through roof beams black with soot . All looked bare and empty , but in an inner room flies buzzed . As the door swung shut behind me I saw they came from a man 's body lying face up , naked but for its grimy turban . He was about fifty years old by what was left of his face - a rifle butt had bashed an eye . The one left slanted , as with Tartars rather than with Turks . Any uniform once on him was gone , so I 'd no proof which he was , and quickly went out , gagging at the mess of his slashed genitals . '' p. 363 ( first paragraph ) . 'How many people lived there ? ' 'Oh , about eight hundred . ' He yawned . 'Did you see any Turk officers ? ' 'No , sir . I was in at dawn . All were Tartar civilians in mufti . ' `` The lieutenant dozed off , then I , but in the small hours a voice woke me - Dro 's . He stood in the starlight bawling out an officer . Anyone keelhauled so long and furiously I 'd never heard . Then abruptly Dro broke into laughter , quick and simple as child 's . Both were a cover for his sense of guilt , I thought , or hoped . For somehow , despite my boast of irreligion , Christian massacring 'infidels ' was more horrible than the reverse would have been . From daybreak on , Armenian villagers poured in from miles around ... .. The women plundered happily , chattering like ravens as they picked over the carcass of Djul . They hauled out every hovel 's chattels , the last scrap of food or cloth , and staggered away , packing pots , saddlebags , looms , even spinning-wheels . 'Thank you for a lot , Dro , ' I said to him back in camp . 'But now I must leave . ' ... We shook hands , the captain said ' A bientot , mon camarade . ' And for hours the old Molokan scout and I plodded north across parching plains . Like Lot 's wife I looked back once to see smoke bathing all , doubtless in a sack of other Moslem villages up to the line of snow that was Iran . ' '' p. 354 . `` At morning tea , Dro and his officers spread out a map of this whole high region called the Karabakh . Deep in tactics , they spoke Russian , but I got their contempt for Allied 'neutral ' zones and their distrust of promises made by tribal chiefs . A campaign shaped ; more raids on Moslem villages . '' p. 358 . `` It will be three hours to take , '' Dro told me . We 'd close in on three sides . `` The men on foot will not shoot , but use only the bayonets , '' Merrimanov said , jabbing a rifle in dumbshow . `` That is for morale , '' Dro put in . `` We must keep the Moslems in terror . '' `` Soldiers or civilians ? '' I asked . `` There is no difference , '' said Dro . `` All are armed , in uniform or not . '' `` But the women and children ? '' `` Will fly with the others as best they may . '' p. 360 . `` The ridges circled a wide expanse , its floors still . Hundreds of feet down , the fog held , solid as cotton flock . 'Djul lies under that , ' said Dro , pointing . 'Our men also attack from the other sides . ' Then , 'Whee-ee ! ' - his whistle lined up all at the rock edge . Bayonets clicked upon carbines . Over plunged Archo , his black haunches rippling ; then followed the staff , the horde - nose to tail , bellies taking the spur . Armenia in action seemed more like a pageant than war , even though I heard our Utica brass roar . As I watched from the height , it took ages for Djul to show clear . A tsing of machine-gun fire took over from the thumping batteries ; cattle lowed , dogs barked , invisible , while I ate a hunk of cheese and drank from a snow puddle . Mist at last folded upward as men shouted , at first heard faintly . The came a shrill wailing . Now among the cloud-streaks rose darker wisps - smoke . Red glimmered about house walls of stone or wattle , into dry weeds on roofs . A mosque stood in clump of trees , thick and green . Through crooked alleys on fire , horsemen were galloping after figures both mounted and on foot . 'Tartarski ! ' shouted the gunner by me . Others pantomimed them in escape over the rocks , while one twisted a bronze shell-nose , loaded , and yanked breech-cord , firing again and again . Shots wasted , I thought , when by afternoon I looked in vain for fallen branch or body . But these shots and the white bursts of shrapnel in the gullies drowned the women 's cries . At length all shooting petered out . I got on my horse and rode down toward Djul . It burned still but little flame showed now . The way was steep and tough , through dense scrub . Finally on flatter ground I came out suddenly , through alders , on smoldering houses . Across trampled wheat my brothers-in- arms were leading off animals , several calves and a lamb . '' p. 361 ( fourth paragraph ) . `` Corpses came next , the first a pretty child with straight black hair , large eyes . She looked about twelve years old . She lay in some stubble where meal lay scattered from the sack she 'd been toting . The bayonet had gone through her back , I judged , for blood around was scant . Between the breasts one clot , too small for a bullet wound , crusted her homespun dress . The next was a boy of ten or less , in rawhide jacket and knee-pants . He lay face down in the path by several huts . One arm reached out to the pewter bowl he 'd carried , now upset upon its dough . Steel had jabbed just below his neck , into the spine . There were grownups , too , I saw as I led the sorrel around . Djul was empty of the living till I looked up to see beside me Dro 's German-speaking colonel . He said all Tartars who had not escaped were dead . '' p. 358 . `` ... more stories of Armenian murdering Turks when the czarist troops fled north . My hosts told me of their duty here : to keep tabs on brigands , Turkish troop shifts , hidden arms , spies - Christian , Red or Tartar - coming in from Transcaucasus . Then they spoke of the hell that would break loose if Versailles were to put , as threatened , the six 'Armenian' vilayets of Turkey under the control of Erevan ... An Armenia without Armenians ! Turks under Christian rule ? His lips smacked in irony under the droopy red moustache . That 's bloodshed - just Smyrna over again on a bigger scale . '' Serdar Argic 'We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the Turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination .

Oh , that 's not so bad . Every time I try to change the oil , I forget to shut off the engine first . The hot oil comes out and scalds me , blinds me , then the engine starts to overheat , and while I 'm screaming in agony and trying to crawl out from under the car , I grab the red hot exhaust pipe and get third degree burns on my hands . My screams intensify as I finally emerge from under the car , and I struggle to my feet in front of the car , whereupon the radiator hose ruptures and sprays me with super heated coolant . Then the engine seizes , but not before the cylinder head explodes , piercing my flesh with fragments of red hot iron . This happens every time . I 'm starting to think I should pay the mechanic $ 25 instead paying the hospital $ 250,000 and the dealer $ 25,000 for a new car .

I have been using both IDE ( or MFM ) and SCSI drives for years . I have 2 IDE and 1 SCSI on one system and the other with 2 IDE , 2 SCSI disk , and 1 SCSI CDROM . I currently using ALWAYS IN2000 SCSI card , but I also have a Future Domain , a Western Digital SCSI card , and I work with an ADAPTIC before . As I recall , all these cards can support boot and floppy drive . However , to use with other controller ( IDE , MFM ... ) the boot drive has to be the IDE ( or MFM ) . You CAN NOT boot from the SCSI if you have other controller in the system . If you guys only have 2 drives ( 1 IDE , 1 SCSI ) . just set up the IDE in your CMOS setup . Make sure you can boot from it . Then , set up the SCSI controller ( IRQ , DMA , etc ) . Set the SCSI drive to ID 0 . Just plug and play for all the cards I seen so far . Only if you have more than 2 drives then you need driver for the third drive and so on . If you have more question , email me , I will try to answer it . Good Luck ! William

For one , your claim that everyone senses it # is not founded , and you have been asked to give evidence for it often . # And then , the correct statement would be it is reason to assume that it # is there unless evidence against it has been found . I have no problem with the second statement . I have provided an argument that almost everyone senses that Freedom is valuable - the only cogent objection to this came from jon livesey , and was offered by some other people too : essentially , that people disagree about fuzzy concepts such as Freedom . It 's a good point , and I 'm thinking about it . # # Your trick is to say , I feel A is not right , and so do many I know , # therefore A is absolutely right . It neglects the possibility that # these people consider A to be right as an effect of the same process , # restricting the claim of its absoluteness to those who have been subject # of that process . In other words , refutes it . You make the ontological # claim , you have to prove it . Nonsense . My `` trick '' is to say : I feel that A is better than B and so does almost any disinterested person I ask . Best evidence is therefore that A really is better than B , subject to the assumption that we can establish to our mutual satisfaction what we mean by A and B , and that the resulting system of values is self-consistent . Now get this : `` really is better '' is an idealisation , a fictional model , in the same sense that `` real material existence '' is a fictional model . It may or may not correspond to something true . It is nonetheless a useful _assumption_ . Far more useful than the equally assumed relativist '' trick '' , to wit : I feel that A is better than B , and so does almost any disinterested person I ask . However , if even one person disagrees that A is better than B , or if even one person dissents from mutually agreed definitions of A and B , then it is the case that B is better than A for that person , and nothing more can be said . I say this is useless because it inexorably implies that a supermajority seeking to maximise A can not morally take action against someone seeking to maximise B ( e.g . a terrorist ) . To do that would be to claim that a supermajority 's carefully considered morality would be better than the terrorist 's - which would , of course , be true , but a no-no for an ethical relativist . To claim that ethical relativism implies anything else is simply weasel words , and an example of compartmentalisation to rival anything in the world of religion . # > # For a similar argument , I sense morality is subjective , it does not # > # hurt me to do things that are considered to be objectively wrong by # > # others . # > # > If you mean that you do things that some others consider objectively # > wrong , and it turns out not to be the case for you - of course this # > is possible .

And as long as you do n't provide evidence for # that there is something universally agreed upon there is no reason to # believe your hypothesis . I 've done this : freedom , with the proviso that I still have to answer jon 's objection that fuzzy concepts like freedom have no objective meaning . # Further , in order to make morality absolute , universal , or objective , # you would have to show that it is independent of humans , or the attributes # above look quite misleading .

I am a homosexual . Not just a normal , run-of-the-mill homosexual , but a rabid homosexual Zionist . I hide behind the facade of pro-Israel rhetoric so as to deflect suspicion of my true motive : the exchange of romantic dialogue with Nick Steel , and our frequent fudge-packing adventures , which we have endeavored to maintain at a discreet level . Of course , the need for discretion has been obviated by my own admission here . The truth is that I could no longer hold this saccharine secret any longer . I love you , Nick , and my love for you surpasses that which I hold for Eretz Yisrael , may she stand forever , as our love has , and as your erection insinuating itself into my kosher rectum always will . =Mark=

Do share the details . HOW TO GET A VERBAL WARNING FOR 146 IN A 55 It 's simple . First , it has to be the first really nice riding day of spring . The bike is back together again , and so are you . Grab all your gear , put it on , and fill the tank with 94 octane premium or better . Head out . In Ames , there is a road that leads to the little town of Gilbert . Gilbert has one stop light , if that tells you something . Having just gotten the bike back together , I thought I 'd take it for a short ride and check things out . Heading out of town , I went into the twisties at a slow pace , just under the speed limit , and started leaning around . The pace quickened as everything felt just right . Finally , the road straightened and I was ready for a bit of speed . Grab third gear , open her up . At roughly 90mph grab fourth gear . Look at as much of the bike as you can , and fail to notice a state trooper following a quarter mile behind . Twist the throttle like a fool , grab fifth gear at 130 or so , and see just how well she 's been put back together . At 146 ( according to radar ) I noticed the front fender was flexing a bit . Thus , I slowed , pulled off the road , removed my helmet and gloves , unslung the took kit I was carrying in a fanny pack , and was just starting to tighten that fender when the trooper pulled in all hot and flustered . `` Have you *ANY* idea how fast you were going ? '' `` Not precisely , no . I was paying attention to the bike and road , not the instruments . I just got her back together last night , and I 'm just out here testing her out before I ride it in traffic . '' `` My radar says you were at over 145mph . Care to tell me why I should n't give you a ticket ? '' `` Because I was testing the motorcycle away from population and traffic , on a strait and flat road , while wearing all the protective gear that safety demands ? '' ( note : I was n't quite that eloquent ) '' Say , what kind of bike is that , anyway ? '' < I was eloquent on my cafe racer replica Honda 750 , a Rat Bike > '' Yeah , I have n't had my bike out of the garage in years . '' < compare riding stories > < pack toolkit , having tightened that fender > '' So why were you out here ? '' `` I figure every other idiot on the road is going to look right through me . If the bike fails somehow in a 35mph zone , I 'm dead . If it holds up out here , then I know it will work right in traffic . I do this evvery year when I rebuild her . '' `` Not any more . You 'll find a better place than *my* highway to do those speeds . If I *ever* catch you speeding on my highway again I 'm going to nail you for everything I possibly can . Now get out of my sight before I write you a ticket . '' `` Yes , officer . '' `` And kid , keep your eyes open out there ...

Nntp-Posting-Host : 131.253.206.80 Organization : Bell Northern Research Lines : 34 [ Lots of stuff deleted because I felt like it ] This MS bashing has definitely lost all its humor value . I think most of the people posting are forgetting that most users of MS products do not even know about internet , and Unix is that very unfriendly place where bizzare abreviations replace the rather comfortable abreviations they know . And the abreviations have subtle differences between the different vendors . While PC users tend to customize any windowing setup , they can not do much with their command line . So to most of the computer users in the world MS product symbolize quality . MS has made their life easier , and more productive and to them that is quality . They do not care about what innovative things MS has done , other than to make their life with a computer one heck of a lot easier . You may know better than most computer users in this world but that will not change their perception . Face it until Unix come up with a decent GUI that is available to all variations of Unix it just will not catch on with the mainstream of computer users .

Yet you would pinch-hit Samuel because you predict that Samuel will be a clutch hitter and Sabo will be a choke hitter . Right ?

I 'm sure some of that basis would have utilized > prior performance . You just would n't have used this particular > aspect of prior performance . Is this not correct ? Right . I would have used aspects of prior performance which have been shown to be consistent in the past . Overall performance , L/R splits , even matching hitting/pitching styles . All of these will give me some advantage if used properly . EVEN IF ALL ELSE WERE EQUAL , there would be no advantage gained by looking at past clutch performance . And in this case , everything else pointed to Sabo . > One more time . I did *not* claim to be able to predict the future . > I said that I accept the above data as an indication that Samuel would > have had a better chance for success in that situation than Sabo . That comes down to the same thing . When Perez left Sabo in , he was predicting the future , the next AB . He was predicting that Sabo was more likely to get a hit than Samuel . By supporting the swap , you are predicting the opposite . > And I am not dismissing your work . I 'm stating my opinion . > You are saying that your work renders any opinion to the contrary > invalid , so that the retention of that opinion is some kind of insult > to your work . Well , yes .

It has not proven to be an indicator of future performance under *any* circumstances . At least none that we 've been able to come up with . If you know of some where it *is* an indicator of future performance , please let us in on your secret . > It is nice , however , to see that you will consider the possibility > that you actually could have some preconceived biases . Most certainly . As I have repeatedly stated , if you can come up with a study which even *hints* at a consistent clutch ability , I would love it !

( Are you honestly debating that ? ? ? ) Sure , we know Sabo did n't get a hit . We have no idea whether Samuel would have done any better or not . One AB most certainly doesn't prove anything ! > I believe that by > season 's end that Chris Sabo 's batting average in clutch situations > will be significantly lower than his batting average in non-clutch > situations .

Or is this a prediction for *all* batters who have , over the past few years , hit ( xxx amount ? ) worse in the clutch than overall ? If you mean the first , then as you say , we 'll just have to wait and see . But the second is a much stronger statement . In fact , it suggests a rule . We can then test this rule on past data to see if it worked for recent years . I think you will agree that if the rule did n't work last year or the year before , that it is unlikely to do any better this year . Right ? > Here 's another one for you .

I 'm not going to get into case analysis . Sure , you can find somebody who hit poorly from '89-'91 and then hit poorly in '92 as well .

It just makes me think that in 1993 > Joe Carter 's batting average in the clutch is not going to be > as high as his ba in non-clutch situations . Gambler 's fallacy . Unless there is reason to expect consistency , a run proves nothing . Can you give us a reason to expect clutch BA to correlate from one year to the next ? I 've seen a detailed study of why I *shouldn't* expect it to correlate . > '' Stupid '' . `` Total idiot '' . > > My , my . Such hostility .

Anybody got 'em ? ? ? I thought the Motor Voter bill passed . In any case , my experiance with Tennessee 's voter registration system ( which you can register with by mail , by the way ) is that nobody who is interested in voting is being denied access to registration . All it requires is just the tiniest bit of interest on the registrant's part and thinking about the election once in the eleven months prior to it . ( Once you register it 's good unless you miss for years worth of elections of move . ) It 's easy to register now . I simply do n't see the value in going out and trying to get people registered who do n't have enough gumption to even write and have the proper forms sent to them .

From : ewolff @ ps.ic.ac.uk ( Erik The Viking ) Subject : thyroidal deficiency Organization : Imperial College Computer Centre Lines : 31 Nntp-Posting-Host : sungx2.ps Hi . My wife has aquired some thyroidal ( sp ? ) deficiency over the past year that gives symptoms such as needing much sleep , coldness and proneness to gaining weight . She has been to a doctor and taken the ordinary ( ? ) tests and her values were regarded as low . The doctor ( and my wife ) are not very interested in starting medication as this `` deactivates '' the gland , giving life-long dependency to the drug ( hormone ? ) . The last couple of monthes she has been seeing a hoemoepath ( sp ? ) and been given some drops to re-activate either her thyroidal gland and/or the 'message-center ' in the brain ( sorry about the approximate language , but I have n't got many clues to what the english terms are , but the brain-area is called the 'hypofyse ' in norwegian . ) My questions are : has anyone had/heard of success in using this approach ? Her values have been ( slowly but ) steadily sinking , any comment on the probability of improvement ? Although the doctor has told her to 'eat normally ' , my wife has dieted vigorously to keep her weight as she feels that is part of keeping an edge over the illness/condition , may this affect the treatment , development ? I can get the exact figures for her tests for anyone interested , and I will greatly value any information/opinion/experience on this topic . I do n't intend this post to be either a flaming of the established medical profession or a praise for alternatives , I am just relaying events as they have happened . Sincerely , Erik A. Wolff

If Irgun had to attack civilian targets to terrorize in order that they might obtain some objective , I 'm sure they would have done so . I also don't exclude Irgun 's action against British soldiers as terrorism . The British were showing signs of favoring a compromise with regards to Palestine , and the Irgun and branch off groups made a point to kill young British recruits so that mothers and fathers back in Britain would get angry at Britains continued presence in Palestine . Sounds like a form of terrorism to me , and not much removed from Arab terrorism . We must not also forget that Irgun , or Irgun branch off groups [ more likely ] killed many jews who were not as hardline zionist as they , or who cooperated with the British . I 'll reiterate again ... . both sides are screwy , but I 'll favor the underdog in this case because I do think they were a bit screwed .

I believe that things are getting mixed here . Critizicing Israel and/or being anti-zionist is not seeing `` the absolute negatives of that culture '' . Maybe , because a person can see the positives of that culture is that that person opposes zionism and the actions of the State of Israel . I , for one , consider the actions of the State of Israel with respect to the human rights of the Palestinian people as an example of an action thaty opposes what Jewish culture was suppose to uphold as an example of respect and what the Jewish people learned about oppresion , segregation and years in the diaspora . > That certainly describes Elias , > since he has no intention of recognizing that , alongside the Palestinian > experience and perspective , there exists also that of Israelis .

Bhamani ) NNTP-Posting-Host : flubber.cc.utexas.edu Originator : faceman @ flubber.cc.utexas.edu Hello . I have a question ( or two ) about the serial ports for the powerbooks ( specifically the 145 with system 7.0.1 ) . Is there a difference between the serial ports on the powerbooks versus any other mac , say plus or ii ? ? I have heard , though not confirmed by apple that the serial ports have problems at high speeds . I also heard that sys 7.1 's new power manager 'fixes ' this problem allowing speeds just as any other serial port . My particular use is that I have a 6811 EVB board that I need to interface with my powerbook via the modem port at 9600 baud . Currently , we are interfacing using mac pluses . I set everything up just as in lab and nothing . In fact , the powerbook locks up . Can anyone help , inform , advise ? I would appreciate it . I would prefer email since I do n't read the news at all . I will post a summary if enough response is generated . Thanks . Faisal M. Bhamani faceman @ ccwf.cc.utexas.edu ps . If this topic has been discussed already , please excuse me and direct me to the appropriate places . thanks .

( Technology shared with > Porsche . Indeed . ) the flat four is also shorter than an inline 4 , so even if it is mounted longitudinally it will not take up lots of length.. and a longitudinal placement is easier for a 4 wheel drive drivetrain . i think that subaru 's ads hold water . in practice , their flat fours are noticeably smoother than inline 4s and completely buzz free , though some may not like its peculiar note . but as alfa has shown , a boxer four can produce a spine tingling scream that only the likes of recent hondas can approach . eliot

This is certainly among the things I would refer to as quack therapy and would tend to refer to any practitioner who prescribed laetrile ( whether licensed or not ) as a quack .

Admittedly , we ( being students , mostly ) are not the world 's most efficient and effective network administrators , but we try . Keeping even the twenty machines that are ( partly ) my responsibility even vaguely looking and `` acting '' similar to the average user , and maintaining `` behind-the-scenes '' consistency is a real headache , but not so bad a headache as trying to remember twenty different folder locations of Norton Utilities when some guy trashes his disk . Often we have hardware problems at peak `` business '' times and have to do some parts-swapping to get stuff working temporarily . . . . Well , I 'll cut to the chase and quit boring y'all . . .. The point is , often we have to re-install software and copy configuration files etc . from machine to machine . By far the easiest way we have found to do this is to get ONE machine working EXACTLY the way we want to , then COPY the complete setup of this machine to the other nine ( of that machine 's type ) . This ensures us that ( for at least ten minutes ) we have ten IDENTICAL machines to work with . Having them networked simplifies this considerably , as our major packages ( WordPerfect , Windows , etc . ) are all network versions and thus only one copy to mess with . Often , however , we need to install a package requested by some instructor to one , some , or all of the machines for a special project . This is usually a hand-written or shareware , etc . program similar to what I believe the original poster was asking about . The few we have had with `` copy protection '' schemes have caused nothing but NIGHTMARES for us to maintain . . In short , do n't waste your time with a copy protection scheme . It 's sort of like outlawing guns . The criminals will get your program anyway , and you will only be hurting the legitimate , honest user . Write a good user 's guide and tech manual , whatever else for your program ( PLEASE do this REGARDLESS of whether you copy protect the thing ! ! ! ) , and only distribute the manual to LICENSED users . Jack the price to cut your losses , but please take a cue from the major companies ( who can admittedly afford the costs of illegal copies far better than you ) and do n't burden the legitimate user with a `` copy protection '' scheme !

It would have to involve new physics as far as I can tell . Closest to `` conventional '' Oort sources is a model of B-field pinching by comets , it 's got too many holes in it to count , but at least it was a good try ... So you have a plausible model for GRB 's at astronomical distances ? Recent observations have just about ruled out the merging neutron star hypothesis , which had a lot of problems , anyhow . We have to look for implausible models and what is fundamentally allowed independent of models . A paper on the possibility of GRB 's in the Oort cloud just came through the astrophysics abstract service . To get a copy of this paper , send a message to astro-ph @ babbage.sissa.it with the subject line get 9304001 Here is the abstract of that paper . The currently favored explanation for the origin of \GRBs puts them at cosmological distances ; but as long as there is no distance indicator to these events all possible sources which are isotropically distributed should remain under consideration . This is why the Oort cloud of comets is kept on the list , although there is no known mechanism for generating \GRBs from cometary nuclei . Unlikely as it may seem , the possibility that \GRBs originate in the solar cometary cloud can not be excluded until it is disproved . We use the available data on the distribution of \GRBs ( the BATSE catalogue up to March , 1992 ) , and the Catalogue of Cometary Orbits by Marsden and Williams ( 1992 ) to investigate whether there is any observational indication for correlations between the angular distributions of \GRBs and comets ' aphelia , assuming that the distribution of aphelia direction reflect , at least to some extent , true variations in the column density of the Oort cloud . We also apply the $ \vov $ test to both distributions . We have performed a variety of statistical tests ( a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for the distributions in galactic latitude , a $ \chi^2 $ test for the spherical multiple moments , and a 2-D cross-correlation analysis ) , including testing sub-samples for isolating the effect of possible observational biases . These tests imply that it is unlikely that the two distributions agree , but the statistical significance is not sufficient for ruling out any connection with complete confidence . We performed Monte-Carlo simulations which show that only when the number of bursts exceeds $ \sim 800 $ it is possible to rule out a correlation between the angular distributions . Currently , it is only the combination of these tests with the large disagreement found for the $ \vov $ parameter which makes the Oort cloud of comets unlikely to be related to \GRBs .

The whole `` saddam is going to invade Saudi Arabia '' was nothing but US State Department propeganda . Saddam ( and Iraq in general ) never recognised the British created Kuwait . They were trying to recover land they believed was theirs , much like the Argentines in the Faulklands . The Kuwaitis pushed just a little too far by taking Iraqi oil and Saddam thought he 'd settle the dispute the old fashioned way ... Everybody would have been much better off had they left the reunited Iraq together and concentrated on taking out Saddam . A strong , united Iraq with an elected government would have gone a long way to ridding the world of the feudal dictatorships in the Gulf . But of course a weak divided Arab people better suits US foriegn policy ... The US had no problem killing tens of thousands of ill-equipted Iraqi soldiers , including burying several thousand alive and slaughtering retreating batallions from the air in defense of Kuwaiti oil , but it has yet to lift a finger against Bosnian Serbs while they slaughter Bosnian muslims ... .

If you look at the frequency spectrum of white noise at a frequency analyzer , you will find that the spectrum power density is flat , which means that every frequency is present in the noise signal . Often pink noise is obtained from white noise by integrating of low-pass filtering a white noise signal . Therefore pink noise contains much more low-frequency components . The effect of pink noise is sometimes used to simulate thunder or roaring animals . An additional low-pass filter with variable cutoff frequency will explain you why . Enjoy it . Wouter .

Hate builds up and drives people away from God ... this certainly > can not be a good way to build love . I do n't agree , but I can only speak for myself . I have a good friend whose lifestyle is very sinful . Do I hate the things she does to herself and others ? Yes . Do I hate her ? Absolutely not . In fact , she tells me repeatedly that I am the best friend she has in the world . I care about her very much despite the fact that I hate how she lives her life . It 's very easy to fall into the progression you describe above . I've felt it with my friend more than once . There is a very important part of Christianity that you 've overlooked above and makes it possible to `` love the sin but hate the sinner . '' Before I look at someone else 's life and sin , I look to myself and am as disgusted by what I see in *me* as I see in others , probably more . Self-righteousness is contradictory to Christianity and is what makes the progression you describe happen . If a Christian can truthfully quote Paul and say , `` Wretched man that I am ! '' [ Romans 7:24 ( NASB ) ] , that Christian will be able to love the sinner and hate the sin . If we have the attitude of the Pharisee who said , `` I thank Thee that I am not like other men ... '' [ Luke 18:11 ( NASB ) ] , we will hate both . -- Scott at Brandeis '' But God demonstrates His `` The Lord bless you , and keep you ; own love for us , in that the Lord make His face shine on you , while we were yet sinners , and be gracious to you ; Christ died for us . '' the Lord lift up His countenance on you , and give you peace . '' -- Romans 5:8 [ NASB ] -- Numbers 6:24-26 [ NASB ]

From : mls @ panix.com ( Michael Siemon ) Subject : eros in LXX : concluding lexicographic note Organization : PANIX Public Access Unix , NYC Lines : 58 This might be better directed to s.r.c.bible-study , which I have begun reading , but since my earlier notes were posted to this forum , I will conclude here as well . A week ago , I managed to find time to consult a Septuagint Concordance and a LXX text with apparatus at the library , and I can now usefully conclude my look at the Greek words for love as used in the Christian background of the Septuagintal translation of the Jewish scriptures . The principal result is that there is a cluster of uses of the verbal noun from _erao : _ , _eraste : s_ meaning `` lover . '' This cluster occurs just where one might most expect it , in the propethic image ( and accusation ) of Israel as faithless spouse to YHWH . The verses in question are Hosea 2:5,7 & 10 ; Jeremiah 4:30 , 22:20 & 22 ; Lamentations 1:19 ; and Ezekiel 16:33 , 36 & 37 and 23:5 , 9 & 22 . [ Hosea seems to have originated this usage , which Jeremiah and Ezekiel picked up ; Lamentations is dependent on , though not likely written by , Jeremiah . ] The `` erotic '' meaning ( in its allegorical use , not at all literally ) is evident . So too in English , unless you complement it with a phrase like '' of the arts '' the word `` lover '' is going to have an overtone of sexual relationship . There is no surprise here , but it is worthwhile to see that standard Greek usage *does* show up in the translations from the Hebrew ! : - ) More interestingly , and some confirmation of my guess that later Koine usage avoided the verb _erao : _ because of its homonymy to _ero : _ ( say ) , _eromai_ ( ask ) , there is an error in Codex Vaticanus ( normally , a very valuable witness ) where a form of _erao : _ is used in a completely absurd context -- 2 Samuel 20:18 , where the meaning *must* be `` say . '' In addition to the above ( and the uses I have already mentioned in Proverbs ) , Esther 2:17 uses the verb in its most natural application , kai e : rasthe '' ho basileus Esthe : r -- and the King loved Esther and , rather more interestingly , 1 Samuel 19:2 supplies a modest degree of support to the gay appraisal of the relationship of David and Jonathan : kai Io : nathan huios Saoul e : [ i ] reito ton Dauid sphodra -- and Jonathan , Saul 's son , loved David intensely [ I 'm using the bracketed [ i ] for io : ta subscript , which I do n't yet have a reasonable ASCII convention for . ] ( The relevance of this to the gay issue is not anything implicit about the `` historical '' facts , but just that a quasi-official translation of the Hebrew text in the Hellenistic period makes no bones about using the '' erotic '' verb in this context . Given the quite general usage of _agapao : _ for erotic senses , this need not mean anything `` more '' than _agapao : _ alone would mean , but it DOES disambiguate the relationship , as far as this translator goes ! ) -- Michael L.

First of all ( this is NOT a snide response ) , if you 're confused about this issue , you will stumble over a lot of other things as well . I suggest that the weakness is your reference material . Get `` An Introduction to Ray Tracing '' by Andrew Glassner for very good coverage of the raytracing algorithm . You could also refer to the 2nd edition of Foley & Van Dam . On to the question . The simple answer is that you just keep adding up all the contributions and then clamping at the maximum intensity . For example , if your intensity values range from 0.0 to 1.0 , then keep adding up and clamp the resultant values to 1.0 ( you might have to clamp the lower bound to 0.0 if you have dark bulbs , but that 's another issue =^ ) . So , you get some illumination equation like this : I = Lambient + Ldiffuse ( light [ n ] ) + Lreflected + Ltransparent The contribution due to reflection is just summed with the light intensity , as is the light due to transparency . Now , a slightly less hand-waving illumination equation is this : I = KaLa + KdLd ( light [ n ] ) + KrLr + KtLt That is , each component of the illumination equation is governed by the material constants Ka , Kd , Kr and Kt . So the maximum you can get from transparency for a given object , for example , might be [ 0.4 , 0.1 , 0.5 ] for a purple-colored glass object . Hopefully this answers your question . I 'll forward my `` illumination equation sermon '' to you also . ______________________________________________________________________________ Steve Hollasch Kubota Pacific Computer , Inc. hollasch @ kpc.com Santa Clara , California

My regular passengers both tend to hold either the rack or nothing at all , I do n't really like having a passenger hold onto me except for short periods . Again that may be biased by the fact that I 've had a couple of new passengers ( a friend recently for her first time on a bike ) who hold on to me real tight , making any kind of maneuvering difficult .

The window-manager is not responding because | > it thinks the window is already in the right place . | > | > Exactly *why* the two components get into this sulk is unclear to | > me ; all information greatly received . This problem is caused by a bad interaction between the way olwm reparents windows , a misfeature of the X protocol , and a bug in the Xt intrinsics . The Intrinsics bug is that it ignores the ( x , y ) position given in ReparentNotify events . Olwm is structured in such a way that , when a window is popped down , the last event the client receives is a ReparentNotify event . At this point , the Intrinsics ' notion of the shell 's location is out of date . If a SetValues is done using the same ( x , y ) position , the Intrinsics thinks it needs to move the shell , so it issues a ConfigureWindow request to move it there . However , a ( mis ) feature of the X protocol is that a ConfigureWindow request that has no effect will generate no ConfigureNotify event . The Intrinsics thus waits for an event that will never arrive , and times out after wmTimeout has expired . ( Actually , things are somewhat more complex because the request is redirected to the window manager , but the net result is the same . ) The solution is for the Intrinsics to note the ( x , y ) positioning information in ReparentNotify events . This has been implemented and is available in X11R5 public fix 20 . This is XBUG 5513 for those of you who are interested in gorier details . s'marks -- Stuart W.

[ ... ] B > Marty B. Marty , I personally would n't be so quick and take that NEJM article on kidney stones as gospel . First of all , I would want to know who sponsored that study . I have seen too many `` nutrition '' bulletins over the years from local newspapers , magazines , to TV-guide , with disclaimers on the bottom informing us that this great health news was brought to us compliments of the Dairy Industries . There are of course numerous other interest groups now that thrive financially on the media hype created from the supposedly enormous benefits of increasing one 's calcium intake . Secondly , were ALL the kidney stones of the test subjects involved in that project analysed for their chemical composition ? The study did n't say that , it only claimed that `` most kidney stones are large- ly calcium . '' Perhaps it wo n't be long before another study comes up with the exact opposite findings . A curious phenomenon with researchers is that they are oftentimes just plain wrong . It would n't be the first time . Sodium/magnesium/calcium/phosphorus ratios are , in my opinion , still the most reliable indicators for the cause , treatment , and prevention of kidney stones . I , for one , will continue to recommend the most logical changes in one 's diet or through supplementation to counteract or prevent kidney stones of either type ; and they definitely wo n't include an INCREASE in calcium if the stones have been identified as being of the calcium type and people 's chemical analysis confirms that they would benefit from a PHOSPHORUS-raising approach instead !

My problems with the AEC are their ( however inherent ) continuous barage of misleading data in order to support the statement that nuclear is not only `` safe and clean '' but cheap to boot . 10 to 15 cents per kilowatt hour is not cheap and neither are nuclear power plants . As far as being safe and clean - I 'll let nuclear power plants speak for themselves all the way from the uranium mines to their decommisioning .

I believe the length of their games has been institutionalized by LaRussa/Duncan . They encourage their pitchers to be overly deliberate , to throw to first often , to study the catchers ' signals , and so on . And almost every A 's hitter takes a step out of the box after every pitch . This is not , imo , a coincidence . This is planned . And I hate it . As for the Gant situation , I did not see the game or the replays . But I do wonder . What if Gant had requested a time out ? Would Hirschbeck have been required to give it to him ?

My Internist , who diagnosed my AV block , slow heart rate and PVC 's , told me something different . She says that heart rate is associated with the electrical properties of the hear muscle , not its size . Exercise lowers heart rate and increases stroke volume , but the effects are unrelated except for their common source . The AV block , she asserts , is another electrical effect , which is irreversable - even when exercise is dicontinued . PVC 's are also common in runners . So my EKG puts me in a class with trained athletes and also with heart patients . Is n't that strange , though ? Are there any not-so-beneficial aspects to athlete 's heart ? Is it all good ?

Note that lead sulfate is not very soluble ( 0.0048 grams per 100 grams water at 25 C ) , and it will thus precipitate out of solution where the reaction is occurring , or the cathode ( positive terminal ) of the battery . ( I am almost sure it is the positive terminal where the precipitate forms , but I may be wrong . Oh well , I do n't have a corroded battery to corrobate , and I do n't feel like thinking through it right now . ) What is important to notice here is that the reaction , as you knew it would be , is exothermic , or energy discharging . If moisture with dissolved electrolytes ( acid rain ) condenses on the battery , a conductive path between the terminals may form . This will discharge the battery as the chemical reaction proceeds . The reaction is reversible , if electricity ( from an alternator or battery charger ) is put back into the battery . Lead-acid batteries must change in chemical composition to discharge . Each cell has all the reactants necessary for the reaction . The non-reacting posts ( terminals ) of the lead-acid battery are there to remove ( or add ) electric energy during a discharge ( or charge ) . Because the reaction is exothermic , it has a tendency to happen , though quite slowly under normal circumstances . So while keeping the battery dry is a good idea , it is not a total solution . To understand why lead-acid batteries DO INDEED discharge faster when stored on concrete as opposed to wood or earth ( dirt ) , one should recall LeChatelier's Principle , which can be paraphrased as : anything subjected to some stress will act to move to a more comfortable position . Here are the thermal conductivities of a some selected materials : thermal conductivity material Temperature , C ( F ) BTU/ ( hr-ft-ft ) ( F/ft ) -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- diatomaceous earth , 204 0.051 natural , across strata 871 0.077 diatomaceous , natural , 204 0.081 parallel to strata 871 0.106 diatomaceous earth powder ( 100 ) 0.039 ( density , 18 lb/cu.ft ) ( 200 ) 0.042 ( 300 ) 0.044 ( 400 ) 0.048 ( 500 ) 0.051 concrete ( cinder ) -- - 0.20 ( stone ) -- - 0.54 ( 1:4 dry ) -- - 0.44 pine ( across grain ) 15 0.087 ( parallel to grain ) 21 0.20 oak ( across grain ) 15 0.12 maple ( across grain ) 50 0.11 Note that the thermal conductivity for `` dirt '' ( diatomaceous earth ) goes down with temperature . Also , 204 C is about 400 K , and the values for earth powder are on the same order of magnitude as natural earth . The thermal conductivity of concrete is around a factor of 10 greater than that of dirt , and is 2-4 times greater than wood . It is these differences in thermal conductivity that cause the battery on concrete to discharge faster than that on dirt or wood . At any instant the discharge reaction is occurring , energy is being released , either as electricity or heat . ( Thermal conductivity of air is about 0.015 BTU/ ( hr-ft-ft ) ( F/ft ) . ) During storage , except for the trickle that passes through any condensate on the battery , this energy is mostly released as heat . The higher conductivity surface will remove the heat proportionately faster than the lower conductivity surface . Thus , if you perfectly insulated a dry battery on all but the bottom surface , at any given battery temperature above the storage surface temperature , the battery on a concrete surface will be discharging about 10 times faster than that on dirt . This is where LeChatelier 's principle comes into play . Removing energy from the exothermic reaction will drive the reaction further to completion . If the reaction normally occurs at room temperature , keeping the battery at that temperature requires the removal of any heat produced . A concrete surface is a better heat sink than a dirt or wood surface . Store a battery in the corner of a poured concrete basement , and you have 3 surfaces removing energy , which '' pulls '' the reaction along . Also , if water evaporates from the battery , that elevates the ratio of sulfuric acid to water . This will tend to drive the discharge reaction .

But not the same good that He would have brought if the Serbians had refrained from the sins of robbery and rape and murder . Nor does the good He purposes excuse us from the duty of doing what is right . ] So what you 're saying then , is that God exercises direct control , or influence upon humanity . He does n't control our every thought or action , but takes what we do , whether it be intended for evil or not , and turns it into something good . It seems to me , that this idea conflicts with the belief that God gave humans FREE WILL . As far as I can determine , it is impossible to reconcile these two different ideas . If God were to exert his influence upon anyone or anything at anytime , he would be impeding upon someone 's free will . Unless , of course , you believe that God did not give us complete and unabated free will , but rather , some sort of conditional free will . Something that allows us to make our own choices and control our own lives except when God wants to use us to fulfill some good purpose of his own by `` hardening our heart '' or controlling us in some other way . I hear alot of people who look at various events , mostly catastrophies or things like the AIDS epidemic and make comments about God 's will . I have a very difficult time understanding why people believe that God controls anything that happens on this planet . Except , possibly when being asked to through someone 's prayer . According to the Bible , Pharoah was going to let Moses ' people go after one or two plagues , but God kept hardening his heart so Moses could cast all 7 plagues upon the Egyptians , the last plague causing the death of many innocent children . So then , God impeded upon Pharoah 's free will and used him as a puppet . God did this not just to free the Hebrews , but to free them in some sort of a grand fashion . I suppose from the Hebrew 's point of view , this could be seen as turning something bad into good , but I 'm sure the Egyptians didn't see it this way . All of your examples of how God turned something bad into something good are based upon showing favortism to one group of people over another . After all , it 's only good based upon your point of view . Why does God , who is supposed to be the god of all of humanity , play favorites ?

Many who belive homosexuality is wrong probably do n't hate the people . I do n't . I do n't hate my kids when they do wrong either . But I tell them what is right , and if they lie or don't admit they are wrong , or just do n't make an effort to improve or repent , they get punished . I think this is quite appropriate . You may want to be careful about how you think satan is working here . Maybe he is trying to destroy our sense of right and wrong through feel goodism .

That's right , the effect has been observed only once . Even the writers of the book were inclined to disbelieve in it . I conjecture that the maker of that photograph began by placing a whole leaf between two plates and taking its Kirlian photo . For his next experiment , he cut the leaf in half , put one half down between the same two plates , and took another K. p.

Windows NT ( tm ) is becomming usable . There are a few things to consider before you make the leap though . First ( for me at least ) is that you can not get a full-speed DOS box . What I mean is , I can not ( for instance ) run Falcon 3.0 or any other resourse intensive program in a DOS box . It absolutley crawls . And my machine is a 486/33 with a 330MB HD and 16MB RAM . If anyone knows how to get a fast DOS box ( or full-screen for that matter ) , please let me know . The second thing is there are still not many drivers around for stuff . For instance , my PAS-16 has been demoted to running as a Sound Blaster ( which is natively supported -- nice ) , because MediaVision has n't produced drivers yet . Your disk should be large enough to keep an 80MB DOS partition , and give the rest over to Windows NT ( tm ) . The only thing is , whenever you wanted to run Windows programs , you 'd have to reboot and log into Windows NT ( tm ) , instead of just typing WIN . Windows NT ( tm ) does seem to be much more stable than normal Windows though . It 'd be a good choice if you have the resources . You should really have *at LEAST* 8MB RAM though . One last thing , modems work well enough , but I have yet to get my FAX card to work , and I 've never heard of anyone else who did either . It 's only better than UNIX because it runs killer software out of the box , whereas with UNIX there is n't the same availablity . I guess it comes down to -- Windows NT ( tm ) is not yet for the faint of heart , it 's still a beta .

This package was bought throught a award give-away company . I attempted to cancel my order before I received the package , but I was too late and the company refused to take the package back for refund . I know the truth which I would never get my $ 697 back , but I wish to get my money back as close as possible . Here is the describtion of the package ... Nishika 3D camera It takes very good picture , never been opended or used . It came with wide angle flesh , carring case , film , and a instruction video . It has four lens and created a 3D effect on a regular 35mm film . Jewelry It came with the package as additional gift . Bahama vacation voucher The voucher is good for two RT airfare to Freeport . The users get a special hotel rate of $ 27 per-person per-night . Meals , ground transfer , hotel tax is _not_ included . Las Vegas , Reno , Orlando The voucher provides one RT airfare , and hotel accomodation for 3 days/ 2 nights . Meals , ground transfer , hotel tax is not included . The voucher is good for all 3 locations , but you ca n't travel to all 3 places at once . Cancun , Mexico The voucher provides one RT airfare , and hotel accomodation for 3 days / 2 nights . Meals and ground transfer , hotel tax is not included as usual . I paid $ 697 for the whole package . So try not to be cold-blooded when you make your offer . Details would be provided by request .

And you could receive the package within a week ( I waited three months to get my first and final packages ) .

I have never heard of anyone that had to return something in the 30 grace peried that had a problem at all with Midwest Micro . They may of thought that you didn't know what you were doing and suggested how to correct the problem . But it sounded as you did n't give them much of a chance to correct things at all . The fact that the PPI worked okay for you is because it is setup more for the no nothing user that ca n't understand the instruction and the commands to configure it to his/her system . When you find out things like the fact the the EC led that looks like you have connected to another EC modem , does n't realy say that . But that it only tells you that you have EC turned on , on your modem . I think that these LED are nothing more that just light to hype up the product . Just like I bet someone took home a few extra $ $ $ in the last year for giving the PPI modems the PC-Magazine award of the year . Not so for the stash ( 12 ) of them that I saw on my test bench . I could go on for hours at no end as to all of the problems that I found with the PPI modems but I will try to control myself . I will not even go into the 6 weeks it took PPI to credit my card back for the modems after they had received them back ... no I will not go into that one nor will I go into talking to the parent co. co from Hayes .

Subject : PHIGS User Group Conference From : hamlin @ ug.eds.com ( Griff Hamlin ) Reply-To : hamlin @ ug.eds.com ( Griff Hamlin ) Distribution : world Organization : EDS Unigraphics , Cypress CA Nntp-Posting-Host : 134.244.15.158 Lines : 173 FIRST ANNUAL PHIGS USER GROUP CONFERENCE The First Annual PHIGS User Group Conference was held March 21-24 in Orlando , Florida . The conference was organized by the Rensse- laer Design Research Center in co-operation with IEEE and SIG- GRAPH . Attendees came from five countries spanning three con- tinents . A good cross-section of the PHIGS community was represented at this conference with participants including PHIGS users , workstation vendors , third-party PHIGS implementors , stan- dards committee members , and researchers from industry and academia . The opening speaker , Dr. Richard Puk , challenged PHIGS users to `` take charge of your PHIGS '' by participating in PHIGS standardization activities and communicating their needs to PHIGS implementors . The closing speaker , Dr. Andries Van Dam , described his vision of the future of graphics standards `` beyond PHIGS '' . Technical paper sessions in the conference covered the following topics : PHIGS and X , Application Toolkits , Application Issues , Texture Mapping , NURBS , PHIGS Extensions , and Object-Oriented Libraries and Frameworks . Panel sessions on PHIGS and PEX , PHIGS Non-Retained Data , Real-World CAD Applications Using PHIGS , and Portability Issues generated enthusiastic discussions and formed a good forum for exchange of ideas , needs , and experiences . The conference also included a day full of tutorials on topics rang- ing from mathematics for 3D graphics to object-oriented tools based on PHIGS . Next year 's conference is planned for March , 1994 . PHIGS EVERYWHERE At the conference , PHIGS vendors described and demonstrated PHIGS products that run on all types of computers , from PCs to mainframes . Megatek Corporation demonstrated their PHIGS extensions including conditional traversal , composite logical input devices , texturing and translucency . Template Graphics Software launched FIGARO+ PRO , the Photo- Realistic Option for PHIGS+ . FIGARO+ PRO is designed to add advanced rendering to the existing PHIGS+ API , with features like ray tracing , materials , anti-aliasing and texture mapping . Radiosity support is also planned . FIGARO+ is an example of how TGS continues to add newly emerging graphics features to their products . FIGARO+ supports immediate mode extensions to PHIGS and also supports SUN XGL , HP Starbase and SGI GL/OpenGL . FIGARO+ for NT will be released this summer . TGS also demonstrated the latest versions of FIGraph , a powerful `` 2-call '' charting system based on PHIGS+ , and FIGt , an object- oriented utility library for PHIGS/PEX developers . G5G and Gallium Software demonstrated a new version of GPHIGS on Silicon Graphics workstations . Scheduled for summer , 1993 , Ver- sion 3.0 of GPHIGS , the company 's PHIGS+ library for worksta- tions , will include an advanced PHIGS debugger that allows PHIGS developers to display and browse PHIGS structures and other PHIGS internal state . G5G also described their Non-Duplicated Data Store that stores pointers to application data in the GPHIGS CSS for more efficient use of memory . In addition , G5G described their application GSE that allows application callback functions during GPHIGS traversal . GPHIGS and PHIGURE , G5G 's data visual- izer and application development toolkit , are currently available on all major workstations that support GL , X Windows , PEX , or Starbase . Wise Software presented a slide show of Z-PHIGS for MS-Windows and ARENA , a PHIGS based modeller/render . Z-PHIGS implements most of the PHIGS+ primitives . In addition Z-PHIGS has built in many advanced rendering features like texture mapping , shadow genera- tion , area quick updates and ray tracing . A demo disk of Z-PHIGS or ARENA is available on request . ATC exhibited GRAFPAK-PHIGS , their full-featured PHIGS implemen- tation based on DEC PHIGS . GRAFPAK-PHIGS is available on most workstation platforms with C , FORTRAN and Ada bindings and incor- porates PEX support . Within the booth sponsored by Advanced Technology Center , Digital Equipment Corporation demonstrated DEC PHIGS V2.4 running on the DEC 3000/400 AXP PXG . ATCs ' GRAFPAK-PHIGS is a port of DEC PHIGS . DEC PHIGS V2.4 contains most PHIGS and PHIGS PLUS features with support for PEX V5.1 protocol . DEC PHIGS also contains most GM/EDS PHIGS extensions including post-to-view as well as proprietary extensions to support immediate mode rendering and the use of PHIGS in an X11 environment . AXP , DEC , and DEC PHIGS are trademarks of Digital Equipment Cor- poration . GRAFPAK-PHIGS and ATC are trademarks of Advanced Tech- nology Center . PEX and X11 are trademarks of Massachusetts Insti- tute of Technology . The IBM exhibit featured a GTO accelerator attached to an IBM 340 workstation running graPHIGS and PEX . Hewlett Packard and SHOgraphics demonstrated at the conference . A Hewlett Packard machine was coupled to display on a SHOgraphics PEX terminal . HP showcased their latest PHIGS product enhance- ments . PHIGS USER GROUP The PHIGS Users Group was formed to aid the development of PHIGS applications and provide user feedback to PHIGS implementors and PHIGS standards bodies .

You should realize that form letters are the *worst* way to influence your congresscritters ; exact copies are routinely placed on the lowest rung of the opinion ladder . If you want to write ( and I think you should ! ) , take the time to really *write* a letter . Things to emphasize : - It 's been said that Usenet is available to the 'technical elite ' , i.e . the techies at corporate sites and universi- ties . Emphasize that you are part of the group that will be making/developing/using Clinton 's 'data superhighway . ' - Explain how you are intimately familiar with both computing and data communications . ( if this is the case ; do n't call your- self an 'expert ' after wiring in a 1200 bps modem . ) This will distinguish your letter from the random flamers . Don't turn it into braggadocio ; just tell them that you know the technical sides of the issue . - Do n't overdo jargon and gobbledygook . Remember , your letter will be first read ( in all likelihood ) by a staffer who may even be a college student ; if they do n't understand it , your views wo n't even make the 'running total ' sheets . - Be concise ; do n't ramble . Rants are *definitely* out of place . Cite references , if necessary , but only use `` accepted '' references like academic journals . `` My neighbor Jim '' is *not* a real refer- ence . 8 ) - Unfortunately , very few Congresscritters *really* understand electronic communications . Encourage them to pick up access to Compuserve , America Online , or one of the Free-Nets . Offer to send them samples . If you are in a position to do so , offer them ( or their staffers back in the home state ) access to your systems . Offer to give a demonstration the next time they 're in town . Your offer to get *personally* involved in helping them *will* give your opinions more credence . - In addition to sending mail to your representatives , send mail to the members of the committee ( or subcommittee ) that is dealing with the issue . If your Congresscritter is n't on the committee , they ca n't be of much help until the matter comes to the floor . -- Wes ps > I 'd suggest drawing analogies between digital communication and the more traditional media , but Usenet does n't have a decent track record in the analogy department . 8 ) -- Rachel Elizabeth Morgan -- 4/13/93 , 7:00 am | Oh yeah , I can be reached as 9 pounds 4 ounces ( despite coming 3 weeks early ) | morgan @ engr.uky.edu | -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - To netters who gave constant encouragement and prayer - thanks for everything !

I would n't worry too much about it , though . We are starting to find out how politically impotent homosexuals really are . The Colorado boycott has fizzled , Slick Willie was effectively prevented from implementing his military policy wrt homosexuals by members of his _OWN_ party , this new study casts a large shadow of doubt on their claims of large numbers , and coming this Saturday they are going to wind up with _TREMENDOUS_ egg on their face when , I submit , no more than perhaps 35,000 queers will show up in Washington while they are promising crowds in the millions .

Is this a problem at all ? It is possible that the individual saw a true prophetic vision , but that he interpreted the scale of time and space according to his material con- sciousness , translating the supersensible perceptions of a plane above that of time and space into an immediate worldly context -- and getting it wrong . Not that he did it rationally , but rather that unconsciously the perceptions became clothed in material images , instead of remaining in the realm of the potential and not-yet-time-space-bound . This difficulty of translating prophetic vision into a concrete when and where has always been difficult , even for the prophets of old . That is why their prophecies are so often subject to multiple interpretations . Likewise , the Apostles seemed to feel that the return of the Lord was to be `` very soon '' in the sense of perhaps the same generation . Yet the meaning of `` very soon '' has proven to be different than they could grasp . Prophetic vision tends to telescope time , so that things that are far off appear to be very close . Another possibility is that the vision was one of a real event preparing to happen , again in the realm of the potential-but-not-yet-manifest and which was thwarted by other forces , including possibly an act of divine mercy . There are many concrete prophecies being made these days by devout and sincere and sober Christians ( and others too ) . It seems that great coming events are really casting their shadow before their arrival in these '' apocalyptic '' times . The various predictions ( I 'm talking about those that appear to be sincere and sober ) are hard to accept , yet hard to ignore com- pletely . One has the feeling `` something is about to start to get ready to begin to commence to happen '' . We are living , as the Chinese saying goes , in interesting times . As for how to discriminate , the Bible does n't help much . There is an Old Testament passage ( I forget where it is ) that says you will know whether a prophet is true by whether or not his prophecy comes to pass . That helps eliminate the failures after the fact , but in the case of an earth- quake it is small comfort . It seems to me that all prophecies that give specific times and places and events should be suspect , not in that they are necessarily false , but in the sense stated above , that all such visions are subject to mistranslation from the plane of prophetic vision to the plane of earthly time and space . For what it is worth , Rudolf Steiner once was asked whether a modern initiate could see into the future and predict coming events . His answer was that it would be possible but then he would have to withdraw from active parti- cipation in them , including proclaiming what he saw . If this is in fact a spiritual law , then the answer to your question about how to discriminate is that the one who makes such prophecies is probably violating that law , knowingly or unknowingly , and as such his message should be considered a priori to be dubious . I.e . I would expect that those capable of making true predictions and giving accurate expression to them would not do so in the way that the prophet of the Oregon earthquake did . However , I can sympathize with the person who published the prophecy . Given the same overwhelming experience that he apparently had , I too might feel impelled , and even commissioned by God to tell my fellow human beings about what I had seen .

From : aidler @ sol.uvic.ca ( E Alan Idler ) Subject : Re : Mormon Temples Organization : University of Victoria Lines : 91 dhammers @ pacific. ? ( David Hammerslag ) writes : > This paragraph brought to mind a question . How do you ( Mormons ) reconcile > the idea of eternal marriage with Christ 's statement that in the ressurection > people will neither marry nor be given in marriage ( Luke , chapt . 20 ) ? Here is the short answer : because only certain marriages are recorded in Heaven . Now for the long answer : In Doctrine and Covenants section 132 , the chapter discussing eternal marriage ( and , yes , plural marriage ) , the distinction between sealings under the priesthood and other marriages is revealed . When `` the children of this world marry , or are given in marriage '' when they receive `` the resurrection from the dead , neither marry , nor are given in marriage '' ( Luke 20:34-35 ) . Jesus was simply teaching that marriages `` until death do you part '' are not in force after death . However , the Doctrine and Covenants continues describing eternal marriage . D & C 132:19 And again , verily I say unto you , if a man marry a wife by my word , which is my law , and by the new and everlasting covenant , and it is sealed unto them by the Holy Spirit of promise , by him who is anointed this power and the keys of this priesthood ; ... [ shortened for brevity AI ] and shall be of full force when they are out of the world ; and they shall pass by the angels , and the gods , which are set there , to their exhaltation and glory in all things , as hath been sealed upon their heads , which glory shall be a fulness and a continuation of the seeds forever and ever . The Lord told Peter `` whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven '' ( Matt 16:19 ) . Do you doubt that Peter was given the power to perform sealings ? Peter thought so because he taught that husbands and wives were `` heirs *together* of the grace of life '' ( 1 Peter 3:7 ) . `` In order to obtain the highest '' ( degree of celestial glory ) , a man must enter into this order of the priesthood '' ( D & C 131:2 ) . When a man and wife are sealed they truly become '' one flesh '' because their eternal `` increase '' ( destinies ) are enjoined completely . Our Father has an eternal companion ( and maybe more because of the plural marriage conditions of the law ) who participated in our creation and is equally concerned with our progress here . There is no scriptural basis for this doctrine . If fact , the only mention of our Mother is in one verse of a hymn written early in the history of the Church : O My Father I had learned to call thee Father , Through thy Spirit from on high , But , until the key of knowledge Was restored , I knew not why . In the heav'ns are parents single ? No , the thought makes reason stare ! Truth is reason ; truth eternal Tells me I 've a mother there . Why do n't we hear more about our Mother ? 1 . Because our Father presides under Priesthood authority ( which is not a calling for Her ) ; 2 . Because we do n't all ( necessarily ) have the same Mother it would be confusing for worship ; 3 . Because our Father wishes to withhold Her name and titles because of how some people degrade sacred things . A IDLER

Greek Efforts to Decimate the Jewish Population of Salonica Culminated in 1912 and 1913 < < Those Jews who survived these assaults in Southeastern Europe fled particularly to Salonica , whose Jewish population increased substantially as a result , from 28,000 in 1876 to 90,000 in 1908 , more than half the total population , though even there increased persecution by local Greeks led many Jews to flee elsewhere in the Ottoman Empire , particularly to the great port of Izmir . Despite all the pressure from Ottomans and foreign Jews alike , the ritual murders and other assaults by Christians on Jews went on and on . Greek efforts to decimate the Jewish population of Salonica culminated in 1912 and 1913 , following Greek conquest of Salonica during the first Balkan War , when many of its Jews , were either killed or terrorized into leaving ... > > < < Though Greece was obligated by the post World War I treaties to allow Jews and other minorities to use their own languages in education and to practice their religions without hindrance , a law was issued in 1923 which forbad all inhabitants from working on Sunday , stimulating a new Jewish exodus as it was intended to do . Between 1932 and 1934 there was a series of anti-Semitic riots in Salonica , with the Cambel quarter , where most of the remaining Jews lived , being burned to the ground . This was followed by regulations requiring the use of Greek and prohibiting Hebrew and Judea-Spanish in the Jewish schools . A start was made also on expropriating the land of the principal Jewish cemetery in Salonica for use by the new University in order to derive the Jews out [ 47 ] . By killing and driving out large numbers of Jews , the Greeks left a substantial Greek majority in the city for the first time , and starting Salonica Jewry on the way to its final decimation by the Nazis during the occupation of Greece starting in 1941 . Salonica and Izmir of course were not the only places of refuge for Jewish refugees entering the Empire during its last century of existence . Istanbul , Edirne , and other parts of Rumelia and Anatolia received thousands more . Nor were Jews the only refugees received and helped by the government of the Sultan . Thousands of Muslims accompanied them in flight from similar persecutions wherever Balkan christian states gained independence or expanded . The Russian conquest of the Crimea and the Caucasus starting in the late eighteenth century , and particularly during and after the Crimean War , combined with the same independence movements in Southeastern Europe that had caused so much suffering and flight among its Jews caused thousands of helpless , ill , and poverty-stricken Muslim refugees to accompany them into the ever shrinking boundaries of the Ottoman Empire , with the Istanbul government struggling mightly but vainly to house and feed them as best it could . From 1850 to 1864 as many as 800,000 Crimean Tatars , Circassians , and other Muslims from north and east of the Black Sea had entered Anatolia alone , as many as 200,000 more came during the next twenty years , while 474,389 refugees entered in 1876- 1877 as a result of the Ottoman wars with Russia and the Balkan states , with an equal number gaining refuge in the European portions of the Empire. > > [ 47 ] Robert Mantran , 'La structure sociale de la communaute juive de Salonqiue a la fin du dix-neuvieme siecle ' , RH no.534 ( 1980 ) , 391-92 ; Nehama VII , 762 ; Joseph Nehama ( Salonica ) to AIU ( Paris ) no.2868/2 , 12 May 1903 ( AIU Archives I-C-43 ) ; and no.2775 , 10 January 1900 ( AIU Archives I-C-41 ) , describing daily battles between Jewish and Greek children in the streets of Salonica .

The third was to stay inside . Last time I checked , `` amassing an arsenal '' and practicing any kind of religion were mentioned in passing in the Bill of Rights . Guess it's OK with you if we just brush 'em aside in order to justify killing a bunch of religious nutcakes , eh ? Of all the idiots I run into in daily life , Dan , your type scare me the most . You 'll accept expediency and a coward 's safety over any belief just as long as the government tells you to . You assume that anyone who does n't comform to your beliefs and ways of thinking are wrong and therefore bad . Worse , you seem to accept without question what the government says is wrong to be wrong . David Koresh 's religion was not mine but then again , neither are the baptists , methodists , catholics or any of the rest of the corporate religions . BUT even though Koresh 's , the Baptists , the methodists , etc , do n't believe the same way I do , I recognize that their religions are equally valid to mine and more importantly are equally protected under the 1st Amendment . You see , I 'm not that much different than Koresh and I suspect many others fit the same catagory . I read the Bible many times and as I learned from it , I discovered that a lot of what corporate religions practice just is n't justified by MY interpretation of the Bible . Therefore I go my own way . So did Koresh . And neither you nor I nor anyone else , either individually or collectively as the great socialist `` we '' has ANY RIGHT WHATSOEVER to tell me or you or Koresh that our religions are wrong . You seem to think that it would have been oh so easy for the Davidians to just forsake everything they believed in and walk out of their compound in order to `` save themselves '' . Think ( if you 're capable ) for a moment about some belief you hold dearest . Would you abandon that belief if suddenly told to do so by the government ? If you would do so you are beneath contempt . Let 's assume you have a belief that you hold dear enough to commit your life to . Do you think it would be the correct course of action for your government to initiate actions specifically designed to force you to make that `` forsake or die '' decision ? The `` forsake or die '' option is exactly what the government forced on the Davidians the day the first wave of black-clad stormtroopers fired that first shot and tossed that first grenade . The FBI clenched it on Day 51 when they sent in heavy armor against 80-some-odd men , women and children holed up in a rickety old building and armed with small arms . The people who stayed , who held to their beliefs over personal safety , whose individual personal honors demanded they die rather than submit , who believed that the Bill of Rights meant exactly what it says , to those people go my deepest respect , regardless of their religion . People like you who blithely blow off the murder of 80 people with `` well they could have come out '' get my most scornful contempt . I 'd spit in your face were there not a network between us . You 're not worth the ashes of those people who burned . John -- John De Armond , WD4OQC |Interested in high performance mobility ?

The Oiler rationale regarding the renegotiation of player contracts is that a deal is a deal . Sather has spouted this repeatedly . Pocklinton has a contract with Northlands until 1999 . A deal is a deal . Perhaps if he included the income he has received from his sale of assets ( players such as Gretzky ) and the income he has received in expansion fees with his revenues he would n't be losing money . He has admitted pulling this money out of the Oiler franchise to put into his other businesses . > The Oilers have paid several times over what the Coliseum cost to > build , and bring Edmonton prestige and recognition throughout the > world that is essentially priceless ... to nickel-and-dime the Oilers > just so Northlands can use revenue sucked out of the Oilers to > subsidize their horse-racing operations is insanity . I think that Pocklington has received ample provincial subsidization . I ca n't really blame him for going after municipal subsidization but he is certainly not entitled to it . Pocklington has `` sucked '' revenue out of the Oilers in order to prop up his failing business interests . Pocklington is not to be trusted . I doubt very much that any Oiler team will ever again make the playoffs under Pocklington 's stewardship . As soon as a player shows himself to be a competent NHL'er and expects to be paid accordingly he is shipped off for younger players and or draft picks . -- cordially , as always , maynard @ ramsey.cs.laurentian.ca `` So many morons ... rm ... and so little time .

Page A11 . FIGURE IN ADL SPY CASE ARRESTED AT S.F . AIRPORT ESPIONAGE : Former police officer is taken into custody upon arriving from Philippines , where he had fled after FBI interrogation . By Jenifer Warren , Times staff writer San Francisco -- A former San Francisco police officer who fled to the Philippines amid accusations that he funneled confidential law enforcement information to an investigator for the Anti-Defamation League was arrested at the airport here on 11 felony charges , police said Friday . Thomas J. Gerard who abruptly left the United States in October after the FBI questioned him about his activities , was apprehended Thursday night after a source in the Philippines told investigators that Gerard was returning home . Gerard , 50 , was booked into San Francisco County Jail early Friday morning on eight counts of theft of government documents and one count each of computer theft , burglary and conspiracy . If convicted on all charges , Gerard could face 16 years in prison and $ 40,000 in fines . Bail was initially set at $ 250,000 after police argued that he was a flight risk , but it was later reduced to $ 20,000 . A friend of Gerard was trying to post bail late Friday afternoon , a sheriff 's spokeswoman said . Gerard returned to the United because he missed his wife and child , with whom he lived on a houseboat in Sausalito , and `` wanted to have his day in court , '' said Police Capt . John Willett , his former boss and one of two arresting officers . Gerard , an undercover agent for the Central Intelligence Agency from 1982 to 1985 , also feared that the CIA was out to kill him , Willett said . In an interview with The Times last month , Gerard threatened to disclose illegal CIA support of death squads in Central America if he was indicted and tried on the San Francisco spying charges . Gerard is a central figure in a scandal over an intelligence network operated by the Anti-Defamation League , a prominent Jewish civil rights organization . Investigators allege that Gerard illegally gave criminal histories to Roy Bullock , a San Francisco art dealer who said he has been an undercover ADL intelligence operative for 40 years . Investigators said they found confidential police files in Bullock's home computer -- which contained entries on 10,000 people and 950 groups -- and in boxes in his apartment . Files have also been seized under search warrants from ADL offices in San Francisco and Los Angeles but authorities have not disclosed their contents . Gerard could not be reached for comment Friday , and his attorney , James Lassart , did not return telephone calls seeking comment . In the interview with The Times last month , however , Gerard acknowledged snooping and sharing some information with Bullock , but denied any criminal wrongdoing . Bullock and Gerard also are under investigation for selling intelligence to South Africa . ADL officials have described Bullock as a $ 550-a-week independent contractor and have vigorously denied knowledge of any illegal activity . On Friday , ADL lawyer Jerrold Ladar said Gerard 's arrest '' has nothing to do with ADL . Other than that , we have no comment on the case . '' Arab-American groups -- which were a main target of the spying , according to police -- applauded the arrest and pressed authorities to pursue the investigation . `` We urge investigators to carry this case forward and to publicly disclose the full extent of ADL and law enforcement involvement , '' said James Zogby , head of the Arab American Institute in Washington . Police , meanwhile , characterized Gerard 's arrest -- the first in the inquiry into the spying scandal -- as an unexpected breakthrough . A former police colleague of Gerard , Inspector Fred Mollat , visited Gerard several weeks ago and urged him to return home . `` I knew he would n't want to live on an island on the lam forever , but we did n't think it would happen this quickly , '' Capt . Willett said . `` This development really speeds up our timetable on the case . '' During his 25-year career on the police force , Gerard was a highly regarded officer known for his work in the department 's intelligence division . His last assignment was on the gang task force . After FBI agents questioned Gerard last fall , he took early retirement and fled to the remote jungle island of Palawan , 300 miles south of Manila . Gerard was arrested at 8:40 p.m. as he stepped from his Philippines Airlines flight . He was traveling alone and looked tanned but haggard after his six-month hiatus , police said . `` He was surprised when he saw us standing there , and got a shocked look on his face , '' Willett said . `` Then he said , 'Hello , I 'm back .

Interesting . Tell us , what happens if I were to say OK , I want to have something else . If the law enforcement wants my traffic , they can record it , then get a search warrant , and get the keys FROM ME , just like they would the keys to a stout private safe , etc . ( Lets say I suspect that there is a way to trivially crack this at the Fed level , with no warrant , say for NSA scanning for keywords , etc. , and the government has abused great power in the past ... ) . So I say `` Mr Vendor , I want something different , independent . I am a paranoid sort , ya understand ... '' . Will the result be `` Sorry , without Government permission , we can not sell you anything secure '' , or would it be `` Sorry , we know which side our bread is buttered on , we can not sell except to government people , law enforcement , and 'special ' people ... '' . What , in your opinion , would be the chances of `` sure , we will sell you this secure system ... be happy to ... '' Also , please be so kind as to tell us what the plans are for private encryption of , say files transferred by modem , or FTP , or data stored on disk ? SURELY you have a feel for what the administration is planning for us people on that ... . With your rather intimate relationship with the FBI , NSA , etc . you must CERTAINLY have an idea . You are surely not going to say `` the people are not to know , until it is too late ... '' This IS supposed to be government of the people by the PEOPLE , isn't it ? That is , the people ARE the government 's BOSSES ? The BOSSES want to know what the * @ ( ) # * & ( @ is going on here ... You see , I am kind of nervous , because in the last month or so , I have seen a non-stop stream of ideas coming out of Wash DC that at least appear VERY STRONGLY to have a common trait to limit privacy ( freedom from Govt eavesdropping ) , and the ability to defend ourselves against violent attack ( no , 911 is *NOT* good enough for 'common folk ' , they arrive only in time to clean up the mess : I would be DEAD if I had to depend on 911 ... ) . You see , with all that talk about National smart ID cards , limiting of encryption to 'government approved ' , denial of means to effective personal defense ( EIGHT bills in congress right now ) , it looks an AWFULLY lot like the whole thing is to be able to trace EVERY ACTIVITY of an individual from cradle to grave . All it would take is requiring that National ID card to be used in all transactions ... and with no effective data protection , and with the people suitably disarmed , there would not be a helluva lot they could do about it , now would there ? All in the name of the War on the Constitu ... er ... drugs , and of course that catch word 'terrorists ' . What is wrong with good OLD-FASHIONED POLICE WORK to build a case ? They do n't want to have to be burdened to leave the office , it seems ... Please read the Bill of Rights ( first ten amendments to the US Constitution ) and tell us how you can reconcile this Big Brother-ish policy of the Administration ( always for a 'crisis ' of some kind , isn't it ? ) with that Bill of Rights in the context of the people who wrote it ? Reassure us - please ... ( or is that no longer regarded as necessary , seeing as apparantly the people have NO input on this agenda , the Administration preferring to make all the DECISIONS in secret , then springing it on us ... ) . Does n't sound much like ... by the PEOPLE to me . I can not help notice that the congress people involved were NOT mentioned on the press release . I find that more than a little bit curious , do n't you ? I sure would like to know who to not vote for come election time ... Yes , I am upset . I feel you are a part of this , because I recall it was you that was posting HEAVILY in favor of a very similar idea ( could have been the SAME thing , it was so close ) a few months ago ... I also recall it was not well received . Apparantly powers-that-be really did n't care ( or were not told , or both ) . From what I see , Clipper will ONLY be useful for conversations I don't want the neighborhood kid listening in on . Any SERIOUS security I don't think I would want to trust it a bit . Might as well use cleartext . Certainly corporations would be rather dumb to depend on this for serious trade-secret data , especially if millions depended on that security . Given enough money , one could BUY any keys they wanted . Buy a crooked judge , and a crooked cop . Given a few hundred thou , they would n't be hard to find . So , we end up with only criminals , terrorists , and the Government with real security , and the ability to eavesdrop . You know the first two , if they are serious , ai n't going to use this thing for THEIR communications . I bet the government wo n't , either ( except perhaps to order a pizza ) . Tell us , will that be prima face evidence of criminal activity , someone not using the 'government approved ' methods ? That just a desire to have PRIVACY is no longer regarded as a legitimate right of an unconnected citizen ? Will that be grounds for a fly-through-the-door raid , and confiscation of all one 's equipment , as 'terrorist tools ' , using civil forfeiture , so there will be no inconvenient need to PROVE any wrongdoing on the part of the citizen ? I have yet another question , are we going to see articles in all the public magazines , consisting of soothing text telling us how great this is , how nice the government is by LETTING us have this illusion of privacy ? That the government is going to be so kind as to let us 'sort of ' exercise a RIGHT ? What you want to bet that I am correct here ? Please answer these questions . As citizens of the United States , we hava a RIGHT to know what our Government plans to 'let ' us have out of the goodness of their hearts ...

Please cite specific examples where an Arab party member was rejected while a Jewish party member was accepted . If you examine these I am sure you will discover that the Arab party member did not have the power base that his Jewish counterpart had . The party structure in Israel has changed quite a bit insofar as knesset member elections go . Knesset members for most parties are now elected via primaries . The top standing members end up with cabinet posts . This is purely a political power issue . Check the ranking of Arab labor party members , as opposed to Jewsih members and let me know which posts are held by Jews that ranked lower in the party than their Arab fellow electees . Once again , if for arguments sake , all the Arab Israelis were to vote for Labor at the next election , you can rest assured that the number of Arab MKs and cabinet members would increase proportionately to the power shift . | > Not their party - them as *individuals* .

From : allan @ cs.UAlberta.CA ( Allan Sullivan ) Subject : Oiler 's rumour - Team moving ? Press conference next week Organization : University of Alberta , Edmonton , Canada Lines : 23 Nntp-Posting-Host : swanlake.cs.ualberta.ca I heard a story on the local sports news broadcast in Edmonton . Oiler owner Peter Pocklington will be holding a press conference next week . While the exact details are not known , it is believed to concern the Oiler 's future . Rumour has it that Pocklington signed a tentative lease arrangement with Copps Collesium in Hamilton . During the press conference , Pocklington may announce the deal . It is quite possible that the deal may simply be a way to force Edmonton Northlands to renegotiate the Oiler lease on the stadium . Northlands has offered to buy the Oilers for $ 65 million earlier , but the offer was rejected immediately by Pocklington . As for me , my opinion is divided ... Edmonton has been fairly supportive of the Oilers . Even though they 're a small market team , they had many sellouts in the 80s . Even with the problems that the team had this year , they still brought in more fans than many teams in larger cities did . On the other hand , if the team does move , there is no place more deserving than Hamilton . Of course , how would that affect the grand realignment scheme of Bettman ?

I have already recompiled my kernel and the german keyboard in the textmode works just fine . I have found out , that there is a preconfigured german keymap for X called Xmodmap.gr in /usr/lib/X11 , so I ran xmodmap /usr/lib/X11/Xmodmap.gr . My first impression was very good , I was able to get Z and Y straight : ) There 's still a little problem I ca n't solve however : I can not get at the backslash , bar , brackets and curly brackets . The ALT-GR key does n't seem to work . I tried xev to find out whether it produces an event at all and it does . Looking up its keycode ( 113 ) in the Xmodmap I found the entry `` Mode_switch '' which does n't ring any bell . The entries for the keys I can not use seem to be correct . Example : keycode XX = ssharp questn backslash The first 2 entries I can even get at . The first one is the unmodified key and the second is the key with shift , but what is the 3rd ? ? My guess is that it should be the key with ALT-GR but it is n't . If anybody has run into similar problems and knows how to solve them , help would be appreciated . CU Alaric

No , it is optional ... as it is optional for doctors to accept it . There are isolated religeous communities in particular that ask for exemptions ( and one e-mail from a Christian Scientist in Edmonton verified for me that it is indeed negative option ) .

I actually have doubts that any new ones have emerged since WW I ... no , scratch that ... there are a few in Western Canada , and *quite* a few in Quebec as part of the post-1980 Quebec Miracle ( out with the nationalism , in with the French capitalism ) . La Groupe des Cooper- antes built a new tower by the Eaton ( 's ) store at Les Terraces , and if you were able to catch Urban Angel on CBS 's Crimetime you 'd see it as the well-lit one with double-turrets at the top . As for Ontario , which still dominates and anchors business up north ... Canada is a very old-money kind of place , and the 1989 Free Trade Agreement saw a lot of odd alliances : labour unions and establishment old money who wanted to preserve their traditional monopolies on one side , and entrepreneurs and internationally oriented businesses and professionals on the other . The final Trudeau administration and the first Mulroney government had a high percentage of nouveaux riches who knew what it was like to make your own money , and that motivated the McDonald Commission under Trudeau which set up Brian's initiative ( Macaroni was against free trade 'til he did a head count of his caucus after the 1984 election ) . > It 's not really insurance if you do n't have alternatives Well , you have to realize that in our society that 's like saying that `` it 's not really national defence '' because you ca n't hire your own Rambo squad instead or even opting out as a pacifist . ( BTW , there are always pacifists in the news arguing about their portion of taxes , but never people arguing over health insurance alternatives ... and we 're talking about a press that is hostile to whomever is in government , regardless of party ; one of their few redeeming characteristics , it seems ( - ; ) . > Also , in the April 14 Globe and Mail , there was a letter from the > director of trauma services at St. Michael 's Hospital in Toronto > responding to an article on a study comparing heart surgery in > California and Canada in which some Canadian doctor worried that > American analysts would seize on the results as proof that Canada > rationed vital services . The doctor ( I ca n't recall his name ) said > that Canada *is* rationing vital services `` as any physician can > plainly see '' . He said that a system in which people are refused > treatment because they ca n't afford it is no different from a system > in which people are refused treatment because the government can't > afford it as a result of deliberate underfunding of the health > insurance plan . In fairness , he did say that both the US and > Canadian systems are in the same situation . The only way to hit at the Canadian system is transient periods of high demand , which is more a function of the doctors monopoly 's tight fist on the licencing . An obvious difference is that in such a transient period , the rationing is of the nature of a mob battling over Cabbage Patch Dolls^TM as we 've seen recently as opposed by rationing by ability to pay ... but the former is a *transient* situation and if a large body of insured patients were to deluge the California health infrastructure , the same would result -- - rationing among the insured population . With smaller markets , there is much less flexibility when dealing with our insured population than California ( which by the way , has 1/3rd more people than Canada in a MUCH more dense area ) . So he is correct in that the resources are fixed ( for a particular time window , or as a function of the doctors monopoly licencing according to the market steady state ) in either case . As for being `` refused treatment '' the government of the day would be shredded to tatters if something like that were to happen ; Canadians can be geographically bad , too , not realizing that their health care is private while only their insurance is n't ... too many people have bought into socialist trype that we have socialized medicine . > I know , I know , the monopoly power of Canadian doctors often leads > them to overstate the problems with the system in order to get more > money from the government ( another case of businessmen , once > scratched , becoming socialists ) . Right , as I 've pointed out above ... > But has n't that just shifted the locus of the problem from one place > to the other ? It has n't really solved it . Either way , the transient situations are hard to deal with since the changes in the private medical care resource take place at a slower rate than the ability of people to fall sick esp . in the light of disasters ( e.g. , Chernobyl ) or bad luck ( a sudden wave of heart disease ) . A doctor needs 4-6 years of training , plus internship and specialty training . > People too often tend to put prescription cold medicine on their > insurance when they really do n't need to . That 's why I 've argued for deductible and copayments rather than education , which is what most Canadian fiscal conservatives are arguing for ( the leftists ? `` Ah , just let 'em spend ! '' -- - yeah , right ! ) . Also , note that only a few provinces cover prescriptions under some high dollar threshold ... in most , it 's your private insurance that covers it just like in the U.S . Still , it all adds up in the OECD measures . > In fact , Buffalo may be the only place in the US where people > get Don Cherry jokes ( : - ) . We get the Sabres ' feed as a replacement game on ESPN tonight ( the Devils ' local metro NY coverage supplants the main ESPN game ) . > ( The NDP cleaning up a Tory spending mess ? And just when I thought > I understood Canadian politics ) . Yeah , it 's a sad story and Saskatchewan Tory leader Grant Devine has been on a nonstop PR campaign to save his sorry butt . The Sask NDP have taken a neo-conservative turn like Hawke , Gonzalez and Mitterand did . > has anybody considered following Singapore 's example and going to a > system where the company and the state buys basic and catastrophic > coverage for everybody , and then you also have an IRA sort of thing > to which you and your employer can can contribute for medical > expenses only ? It would tend to discourage you from overusing it . The medical IRA would have limited use , as you 'd need a lower catastrophic threshold else there 'd still be a drain on the public purse if someone exhausts their IRA . Also , Singapore has a much more autocratic mentality which has seaped down into its masses ( if Singaporeans that I 've met are any indication ... I don't mean any disprespect here ) where they 'd let you just die . > One of the good things about being the last country to create a > national health care system , should we decide to , is that we have > everybody else 's mistakes to learn from .

Yes , many ... and pretty close to a lot of smaller towns or not too far from a bigger town . Just take a look at a detailed atlas ... or better , take a flight from Pittsburgh or Rochester to Toronto .

It 's about time ! I 've ragged on my own doctor friends as to why they do n't invest in their own private practices ... in the end , it 's their money . But they choose to spend it on America 's Cup pipedreams , and that 's none of my business . As for `` provincially owned '' ... for sure it 's against the law in Canada for governments to be directly involved in the provision of health care except in the military or native reser- vations . What that term actually means is that the facility gets by on public grants to meet shortfall from *lack of use* ... no kidding . Medical practice itself is much more conservative up north . My own best friend did two clerkships at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester , MN , and is no stranger to high tech medicine ... but his boat comes first . > There were some people expressing concern that it was the first wedge of > two-tiered health care and that it might violate the Canada Health Act . No , it 's probably socialist whiners who are offended that we have private practices ... and always have . They can all take cash anyways ... so why not have a particular facility ? The Canadian big government mentality often imagines government where it does not even exist ... Since the French and Germans have become more entrepreneurial and less laidback without sacrificing their culture and values , then Canadians can do the same . As I 've pointed out above , the law states that it is illegal for the *government* to provide any health services except for the military and natives . Look , nobody stopped the clinic when they planned on the MRI ... nobody stopped them when they bought it . Nobody seems to be stopping them from using it , either . Much ado about nothing .

I 'm certain there is exaggeration somewhere , because the GAO study of Canada cited often on USENET did not find access to MRI to be a problem .

From : marka @ hcx1.ssd.csd.harris.com ( Mark Ashley ) Subject : Marian Apparitions # 1 Organization : Ft. Lauderdale , FL Lines : 56 The Blessed Virgin Mary appeared to Catherine Laboure , a nun of the sisters of Charity on July 18 , 1830 at Rue du Bac , Paris . Sister Catherine was awakened late that night by a small boy , age 5 or 6 , who was literally glowing with some sort of interior light . The child led her to the sanctuary of the chapel where he promised the Virgin Mary was to be found awaiting her . Our Lady appeared to her and instructed her for two hours or more on matters pertaining to her life and to the future of France and the world . On November 27 Our Lady appeared again to Catherine . She instructed her to have a medal struck . She told her that those who wore this medal would enjoy special protection from the Mother of God and would receive great graces . In less than a year there were three more apparitions . In June of 1831 the medals were a reality . Many reports were received by those who wore it . Within two years of its issuing the medal was known as the `` Miraculous Medal '' . Catherine died in 1876 . Her body to this day is remarkably preserved ( incorrupt ) . She was canonized on July 27 , 1947 . Her body lies in the chapel at the motherhouse on the Rue du Bac where she had her first meeting with Our Lady . The apparition on November 27 1830 was of average height and clothed in white with a veil that flowed over the head and fell to the floor . Above the altar , a pyramid painted to represent God 's all knowing wisdom looked down on them . Our Lady 's feet rested on a white globe and there was also a green serpent with yellow spots that she was stepping on . In her hands was a golden ball that represented the world . Great streams of light issued from her hands and she also showed Catherine an image of two hearts , the Sacred Heart wrapped in piercing thorns and her own heart punctured by a sword . The sword represented her suffering with Jesus . The apparitions announced the onset of the great battle and forewarned that a dark era lay in the immediate future . It was the apparition leading up to the recent ones . Our Lady began to dispense secrets . And with the globe she revealed herself in worldwide dispute with the forces of the dark . She told Catherine `` The times are evil . Misfortunes will fall upon France . The throne will be overturned . The entire world will be overcome by evils of all kinds . '' Refer to books on St. Catherine for more of Our Lady 's messages . A copy of the medal is also available in Catholic bookstores . I will post other Marian events every few days or so including the ones happening today which are still under investigation . These postings serve only to introduce you to these events . Please look more into them and understand the reason for the increasing number and urgency of these apparitions . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Mark Ashley |DISCLAIMER : My opinions .

First , you seem to assume all atheists think alike . An atheist does not believe in the existence of a god . Our opinions on issues such as capital punishment and abortion , however , vary greatly . If you were attacking the views of a particular atheist ( Benedikt , I presume ) , then please present your argument as such and do not lump us all together . As for the issues , let 's start with abortion . Personally , I do not support abortion as a means of population control or contraception-after-the-fact . However , I support the right of any woman to have an abortion , regardless of what my personal views may be , because it would be arrogant of me to tell any individual what he/she may or may not do to his/her body , and the domain of legislators should not extend into the uterus . That 's my opinion , and I am sure many atheists and theists would disagree with me . I do not defend homosexuality as a means of population control , but I certainly defend it as an end to itself . I think most homosexuals would be angered to hear of anyone characterizing their personal relationship as nothing more than a conscious effort to keep population levels down . As for atheists believing all values are biological , I have no idea what you 're talking about . Finally , there are the issues of war and capital punishment . An atheist can object to either one just as easily as a theist might . You seem to be hung up on some supposed conspiratorial link between atheism and population control .

Do infants have faith ? Let 's look at Aaron > what the Bible has to say about it . Yes , let do . Try : '' And if anyone causes one of these little ones *who believes in me* to sin , it would be better for him to be thrown into the sea with a large millstone tied around his neck . '' Mark 9:42 '' Let the little children come to me , and do not hinder them , for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these . I tell you the truth , anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it . '' The Colossians passage does not make faith a requirement for baptism . It merely says that in baptism we are born again , regenerated , and resurrected through faith . In the case of an infant I would say that baptism works faith in the heart of the infant -- through the power of the word . The Colossians passage does make baptism a spiritual circumcision . Circumcision was the means by which a male infant was made a part of God 's covenant with Israel . It was commanded to be performed on the eighth day . The early church understood this , and even debated whether baptism had to be performed on the eighth day , or if it could in fact be done earlier .

'' Aaron > So then we receive God 's gift of faith to us as we hear the Aaron > message of the gospel . And the gospel is surely preached at any infant 's ( or adult 's ) baptism . Indeed , in a very real sense , the sacraments are the Gospel made tangible . Aaron > Faith is a possible response to hearing Aaron > God 's word preached . Kids are not yet spiritually , Aaron > intellectually , or emotionally mature enough to respond to Aaron > God 's word . How do you know they are not yet mature enough to have faith ? Do you know this on the basis of God 's Word , or from your own reason ? Faith is also described as a gift from God , Ephesians 2:8,9 . He gives faith to infants just as he gives it to adults , through the power of the gospel , Romans 1:6 . Aaron > If you read all of Ezekiel 18 , you will see that God doesn't Aaron > hold us guilty for anyone else 's sins . So we can have no Aaron > original guilt from Adam . Here you show that you just do n't understand original sin -- you are arguing against a straw man . Maybe you 've been talking to Catholics too much . I don't know . But original sin does not consist of God 's imputation of Adam 's guilt to us . It consists of our inheritance of Adam 's sinful nature . It is actual sin . See for example , the Augsburg Confession , Article II , and the Apology of the Augsburg Confession , Article II , and , for extra credit , John Knox 's ` The Scots confession ' , Article III . Aaron > Now then that we have a little more background as to why Aaron > original sin is not Biblical , let 's look at some of the Aaron > scriptures used to support it . Aaron > Romans 5:12 `` Therefore , just as sin entered the world through Aaron > one man , and death through sin , and in this way death came to Aaron > all men , because all sinned -- '' Ask yourself this question . `` Do infants ever die ? '' Then ask yourself , `` If infant baptism is not valid , then where was the Christian Church during all the centuries when almost all of the baptisms were performed on infants ?

You might also compare Genesis 8:21 , `` The LORD smelled the pleasing aroma and said in his heart , ` Never again will I curse the ground because of man , even though every inclination of his heart is evil from childhood ... .

Only global changes could be done unless the software were very different and much more complicated . If you want to do colour editing on a 24 bit image , you need much more powerfull software - which is readily available commercially . And lastly , JPEG is a compression algorithm .

Do you reject the supreme > jurisdiction of the 263rd sucessor of St. Peter ( who blessed St. John > Mark , Bishop of Alexandria was translator for ) and his predecessors ? Or > his infallibility ? Or what other things perhaps ? For your first set of questions ( regarding the energy and will of Christ ) I quote to you the relevant part of the Statement signed by both Eastern ( Chalcedonian ) and Oriental ( non-Chalcedonian ) Orthodox scholars a few years ago ( Both families = both Orthodox churches ) : 1 . Both families agreed in condemning the Eutychian heresy . Both families confess that the Logos , the Second Person of the Holy Trinity , only begotten of the Father before the ages and consubstantial with Him , was incarnate and was born from the Virgin Mary Theotokos ; fully consubstantial with us , perfect man with soul , body and mind ( $ \nu o \upsilon \zeta $ ) ; He was crucified , died , was buried and rose from the dead on the third day , ascended to the Heavenly Father , where He sits on the right hand of the Father as Lord of all creation . At Pentecost , by the coming of the Holy Spirit He manifested the Church as His Body . We look forward to His coming again in the fullness of His glory , according to the Scriptures . 2 . Both families condemn the Nestorian heresy and the crypto-Nestorianism of Theodoret of Cyrus . They agree that it is not sufficient merely to say that Christ is consubstantial both with His Father and with us , by nature God and by nature man ; it is necessary to affirm also that the Logos , Who is by nature God , became by nature man , by His incarnation in the fullness of time . 3 . Both families agree that the Hypostasis of the Logos became composite by uniting to His divine uncreated nature with its natural will and energy , which He has in common with the Father and the Holy Spirit , created human nature , which He assumed at the Incarnation and made His own , with its natural will and energy . 4 . Both families agree that the natures with their proper energies and wills ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ are united hypostatically and naturally without confusion , without change , ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ without division and without separation , and that they are distinguished in ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ thought alone . ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 5 . Both families agree that He who wills and acts is always the one Hypostasis of the Logos Incarnate . [ ... ] I guess that adresses your question adequately . As for your second set of questions , I am afraid they are irrelevant to the discussion ( at least from my point of view ) of Monophysitism . I do not see how they relate to the topic we are discussing ( other than to start an endless Orthodox-RC debate which I do not plan to engage into ) . As a brief answer to your questions , the position of the Coptic Orthodox Church regarding the Roman pontiff , his jurisdiction , his infalability , etc . is exactly the same as all the other Orthodox churches .

I do n't think Joe was saying any such thing . However , your question on `` asking Jesus to come into your heart '' seems to imply that infants are not allowed to have Christ in theirs . Why must Baptism always be viewed by some people as a sort of `` prodigal son '' type of thing ; i.e . a sudden change of heart , going from not accepting Christ to suddenly accepting Christ ? Why ca n't people start out with Christ from shortly after birth , and build their relationship from there ? After all , does a man suddenly meet a woman , and then marry her that same day ? From my experiences , I 've learned that all relationships must be built , including one 's relationship with God . Also Joe is speaking from the standpoint that Baptism is not just a ritual , but that through it God bestows sacramental grace upon the recipient . Certainly for those with the mental faculties to know Christ it is necessary to believe in Him . However , the Sacrament itself bestows grace on the recipient , and makes a permanent mark of adoption into God 's family on the soul . - - - - - - - - - - Steve Creps , Indiana University creps @ lateran.ucs.indiana.edu

Also , users can send the authors feedback , to report text errors and software bugs , make suggestions , and submit exercises .

Errata for `` An Introduction to Ray Tracing '' is available on wuarchive.wustl.edu in graphics/graphics/books/IntroToRT.errata . Errata for `` Digital Image Warping '' is in the same directory as '' Digital-Image-Warping.errata '' . All C code from the `` Graphics Gems '' series is available via anonymous ftp from princeton.edu . Look in the directory pub/Graphics/GraphicsGems for the various volumes ( Gems , GemsII , GemsIII ) , and get the README file first . Errata to _Graphics Gems_ and _Graphics Gems II is available on wuarchive.wustl.edu in graphics/graphics/books . A list of computer graphics , computational geometry and image processing journals is available from Juhana Kouhia , jk87377 @ cs.tut.fi . 2 ) Drawing three-dimensional objects on a two-dimensional screen . The simple answer is , you divide by the depth . For a more verbose explanation , see any of the above references , starting with : The Foley & Van Dam & Feiner & Hughes `` Computer Graphics '' book is certainly a good start . Chapter 6 is `` Viewing in 3D '' , then read chapter 15 , '' Visible-Surface Determination '' . For more information go to chapter 16 for shading , chapter 19 for clipping , and branch out from there . 3 ) Quantizing 24 bit images down to 8 bits . Find a copy of `` Color Image Quantization for Frame Buffer Display '' by Paul Heckbert , SIGGRAPH '82 Proceedings , page 297 . There are other algorithms , but this one works well and is fairly simple . Implementations are included in most raster toolkits ( see item 7 below ) . A variant method is described in `` Graphics Gems '' , p. 287-293 . Note that the code from the `` Graphics Gems '' series is all available from an FTP site , as described above . Check out John Bradley 's `` Diversity Algorithm '' , which is incorporated into the xv package and described in the back of the manual . The ImageMagick package ( see section 7 for where it is ) contains another quantizing algorithm which is presented as `` doing a better job than the other algorithms , but slower '' . There 's also an implementation of : Wan , Wong , and Prusinkiewicz , _An Algorithm for Multidimensional Data Clustering_ , Transactions on Mathematical Software , Vol . 14 # 2 ( June , 1988 ) , pp . 153-162. avialable as princeton.edu : pub/Graphics/colorquant.shar . This code , in modified form , appears in the Utah Raster Toolkit as well . 4 ) Converting color into grayscale . The NTSC formula is : luminosity = .299 red + .587 green + .114 blue 5 ) Quantizing grayscale to black & white . The only reference you need for this stuff is : Digital Halftoning , Robert Ulichney , MIT Press 1987 , ISBN 0-262-21009-6 But before you go off and start coding , check out the image manipulation software mentioned in item 7 below . All of the packages mentioned can do some form of gray to b & w conversion . 6 ) Rotating a raster image by an arbitrary angle . The obvious but wrong method is to loop over the pixels in the source image , transform each coordinate , and copy the pixel to the destination . This is wrong because it leaves holes in the destination . Instead , loop over the pixels in the destination image , apply the *reverse* transformation to the coordinates , and copy that pixel from the source . This method is quite general , and can be used for any one-to-one 2-D mapping , not just rotation . You can add anti-aliasing by doing sub-pixel sampling . However , there is a much faster method , with antialising included , which involves doing three shear operations . The method was originally created for the IM Raster Toolkit ( see below ) ; an implementation is also present in PBMPLUS . Reference : `` A Fast Algorithm for Raster Rotation '' , by Alan Paeth ( awpaeth @ watcgl.waterloo.edu ) Graphics Interface '86 ( Vancouver ) . An article on the IM toolkit appears in the same journal .

'' There are a number of automated mail servers that will send you things like this in response to a message . See item 13 below for details on some . Also , the newsgroup alt.graphics.pixutils is specifically for discussion of software like this . You may find useful information there . 8 ) Format documents for TIFF , IFF , BIFF , NFF , OFF , FITS , etc . You almost certainly do n't need these . Read the above item 7 on free image manipulation software . Get one or more of these packages and look through them . Chances are excellent that the image converter you were going to write is already there . But if you still want one of the format documents , many such files are available by anonymous ftp from zamenhof.cs.rice.edu in directory pub/graphics.formats . These files were collected off the net and are believed to be correct . This archive includes pixel formats , and two- and three-dimensional object formats . The future of this archive is uncertain at the moment , as Mark Hall < foo @ cs.rice.edu > will apparently no longer be maintaining it . A second graphics file format archive is now being actively maintained by Quincey Koziol ( koziol @ ncsa.uiuc.edu ) . The latest version exists at ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu in /misc/file.formats/graphics.formats . Apparently , neither of these is complete , you might want to check both . FITS stands for Flexible Image Transport System . It 's a file format most often used in astronomy . Despite the name , it can contain not only images but other things as well . There is a regular monthly FITS basics and information posting on sci.astro.fits - read it if you want to know more . 9 ) Converting between vector formats . A lot of people ask about converting from HPGL to PostScript , or MacDraw to CGM , or whatever . It is important to understand that this is a very different problem from the image format conversions in item 7 . Converting one image format to another is a fairly easy problem , since once you get past all the file header junk , a pixel is a pixel -- the basic objects are the same for all image formats . This is not so for vector formats . The basic objects -- circles , ellipses , drop-shadowed pattern-filled round-cornered rectangles , etc . -- vary from one format to another . Except in extremely restricted cases , it is simply not possible to do a one-to-one conversion between vector formats . There is software for converting to and from CGM files on ftp.psc.edu . The contributor states that it runs on Unix , MS-Windows , and possibly the Mac . A better , more specific blurb would be most welcome . On the other hand , it is quite possible to do a close approximation , rendering an image from one format using the primitives from another . As far as I know , no one has put together a general toolkit of such converters , but two different HPGL to PostScript converters have been posted to comp.sources.misc . Check the index on your nearest archive site . A related frequent question is how to convert from some vector format to a bitmapped image - from PostScript to Sun raster format , or HPGL to X11 bitmap . For example , some of the commercial PostScript clones for PC 's allow you to render to a disk file as well as a printer . Also , the PostScript interpreters in the NeXT box and in Sun 's X11/NeWs can be used to render to a file if you 're clever . But in general , the answer is no . However , if someone were to put together a vector to vector conversion toolkit , adding a vector to raster converter would be trivial . GNU ghostscript ( from the FSF - current version 2.5.2 ) includes drivers for both ppm and gif format files , thus it can be used as a PostScript to ppm or a PostScript to GIF filter . ( It implements essentially all of PostScript level 1 and alot of Display PostScript and level 2 ) . 10 ) How to get Pixar films .

Or , just write to : Direct Cinema Limited 1749 14th Street Santa Monica , CA 90404-4342 Allan Braunsdorf has this to say : At SIGGRAPH they were selling a tape with all four shorts for $ 25 . That was a sale price . You can get it for slightly more than that normally . ( $ 35 maybe . ) I believe it's available from RenderMan Retail ( at Pixar 's address ) . Pixar 1001 West Cutting Blvd . Richmond , CA . 94804 ( 510 ) 236-4000 ( 510 ) 236-0388 ( FAX ) You can obtain a video directly from Pixar which contains `` Luxo , Jr. '' , `` Red's Dream '' , `` Tin Toy '' and `` Knicknack '' for $ 25.00 , plus $ 2.50 for shipping . They will take your order over the phone or via FAX with a major credit card . I ordered mine just last week and received it several days later . Do n't expect to be able to rent a copy from your local video store . According to the license agreement printed on the back cover of the case , it can not be rented . 11 ) How do I draw a circle as a Bezier ( or B-spline ) curve ? The short answer is , `` You ca n't . '' Unless you use a rational spline you can only approximate a circle . The approximation may look acceptable , but it is sensitive to scale . Magnify the scale and the error of approximation magnifies . Deviations from circularity that were not visible in the small can become glaring in the large . If you want to do the job right , consult the article : `` A Menagerie of Rational B-Spline Circles '' by Leslie Piegl and Wayne Tiller in IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications , volume 9 , number 9 , September , 1989 , pages 48-56 . For rough , non-rational approximations , consult the book : Computational Geometry for Design and Manufacture by I. D. Faux and M. J. Pratt , Ellis Horwood Publishers , Halsted Press , John Wiley 1980 . For the best known non-rational approximations , consult the article : `` Good Approximation of Circles by Curvature-continuous Bezier Curves '' by Tor Dokken , Morten Daehlen , Tom Lyche , and Knut Morken in Computer Aided Geometric Design , volume 7 , numbers 1-4 ( combined ) , June , 1990 , pages 33-41 [ Elsevier Science Publishers ( North-Holland ) ] 12 ) How to order standards documents . The American National Standards Institute sells ANSI standards , and also ISO ( international ) standards . Their sales office is at 1-212-642-4900 , mailing address is 1430 Broadway , NY NY 10018 . It helps if you have the complete name and number . Some useful numbers to know : CGM ( Computer Graphics Metafile ) is ISO 8632-4 ( 1987 ) . GKS ( Graphical Kernel System ) is ANSI X3.124-1985 . PHIGS ( Programmer 's Hierarchical Interactive Graphics System ) is ANSI X3.144-1988 . IGES is ASME/ANSI Y14.26M-1987 . Language bindings are often separate but related numbers ; for example , the GKS FORTRAN binding is X3.124.1-1985 . Standards-in-progress are made available at key milestones to solicit comments from the graphical public ( this includes you ! ) . ANSI can let you know where to order them ; most are available from Global Engineering at 1-800-854-7179 . 13 ) How to FTP by email . There are a number of sites that archive the Usenet sources newsgroups and make them available via an email query system . You send a message to an automated server saying something like `` send comp.sources.unix/fbm '' , and a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail . In addition , there is at least one FTP-by-mail server . Send mail to ftpmail @ decwrl.dec.com saying `` help '' and it will tell you how to use it . Note that this service has at times been turned off due to abuse . 14 ) How to tell whether a point is within a planar polygon . Consider a ray originating at the point of interest and continuing to infinity . If it crosses an odd number of polygon edges along the way , the point is within the polygon . If the ray crosses an even number of edges , the point is either outside the polygon , or within an interior hole formed from intersecting polygon edges . This idea is known in the trade as the Jordan curve theorem ; see Eric Haines ' article in Glassner 's ray tracing book ( above ) for more information , including treatment of special cases . Another method is to sum the absolute angles from the point to all the vertices on the polygon . If the sum is 2 pi , the point is inside , if the sum is 0 the point is outside . However , this method is about an order of magnitude slower than the previous method because evaluating the trigonometric functions is usually quite costly . Code for both methods ( plus barycentric triangle testing ) can be found in the Ray Tracing News , Vol . 5 , No . 3 , available from princeton.edu : pub/Graphics/RTNews/RTNv5n3.Z . 15 ) How to tessellate a sphere . One simple way is to do recursive subdivision into triangles . The base of the recursion is an octahedron , and then each level divides each triangle into four smaller ones . Jon Leech < leech @ cs.unc.edu > has posted a nice routine called sphere.c that generates the coordinates . It 's available for FTP on ftp.ee.lbl.gov and princeton.edu . 16 ) Specific references on ray-tracing and global illumination . Rick Speer maintains a cross-indexed ray-tracing bibliography : Highlights of this edition- i ) more than 500 citations spanning the period from 1968 through November '91 ; ii ) papers from all Siggraph , Graphics Interface , Eurographics , CG International and Ausgraph proceedings through December , '91 ; iii ) all citations keyworded for easy lookup ; iv ) cross-indices by keyword and author ; v ) glossary of the 119 keywords used . The bib is in the form of a PostScript file . The printout is 41 pages long . Below is a list of ftp sites and the dirs that contain the file . It 's named '' speer.raytrace.bib.ps.Z '' and is compressed at most sites- Site Dir wuarchive.wustl.edu graphics/graphics/bib/RT.BIB.Speer/ karazm.math.uh.edu pub/Graphics/ gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au pub/papers/ nic.funet.fi pub/sci/papers/graphics coral.cs.jcu.edu.au graphics/papers/ Eric Haines ( erich @ eye.com ) maintains ray tracing and radiosity/global illumination bibliographies . These are in `` refer '' format , and so can be searched electronically ( a simple awk script to search for keywords is included with each ) . The bibliographies are available at most of the sites listed above , and the most current versions are maintained at princeton.edu : pub/Graphics/Papers as `` RayBib . * '' and `` RadBib.* '' . Tom Wilson ( wilson @ cs.ucf.edu ) has collected over 300 abstracts from ray tracing related research papers and books . The information is essentially in plaintext , and Latex and troff formatting programs are included . This collection is available at most of the sites above as `` rtabs.* '' . 17 ) SIGGRAPH information online [ from Steve Cunningham and Ralph Orlick ] ACM-SIGGRAPH announces its online information site at siggraph.org ( 128.248.245.250 ) . This site now provides SIGGRAPH information via both anonymous ftp and an electronic mail archive server . The anonymous ftp service is very standard , and the ftp directory includes both conference and publications subdirectories . To retrieve information by electronic mail , send mail to archive-server @ siggraph.org and in the subject or the body of the message include the message send followed by the topic and subtopic you wish . A good place to start is with the command send index which will give you an up-to-date list of available information . 18 ) SIGGRAPH Panels Proceedings available [ from Steve Cunningham and Bob Judd ] ACM SIGGRAPH announces the availability of the SIGGRAPH '91 Panels Proceedings at the siggraph.org site ( 128.248.245.250 ) . The proceedings are available in three formats : text ( ASCII ) rtf ( rich text format , suitable for many word processors ) word ( MS Word for the Macintosh ) They may be retrieved from siggraph.org in two ways : ( 1 ) by anonymous ftp change to one of the directories publications/s91/panels_proceedings/ [ text|rtf|word ] The text and rtf files may be downloaded in ASCII mode , while the word files are stored in MacBinary format and must be downloaded in binary mode . Each directory contains a Table of Contents file ( TOC ) that describes the contents of each panel file . ( 2 ) by electronic mail send mail to archive-server @ siggraph.org You can retrieve either the text or rtf files . We suggest that you first retrieve the index files by putting one of the messages send panel91-txt index send panel91-rtf index in the subject or body of the message . You will get the necessary information to retrieve the actual transcript files . 19 ) Graphics mailing lists There are a variety of graphics-related mailing list out there , each covering either a single product or a single topic . I have been an active participant in one of these for some time now , and find the focus and expertise which can be brought to bear on an isolated topic to be nothing short of amazing . Please send me the appropriate information if you have any others you would like to see added .

Comments - 26 formats , no software ( this is good , IMHO - I prefer books which are non-platform-dependent ) . Questions about this book may be sent to gbook @ iecc.cambridge.ma.us . 21 ) What about GIF ? GIF stands for Graphics Interchange Format . It is portable and usable upon a wide variety of platforms . It is quite limited in some ways ( yes , the keeper of the FAQ has some opinions after all ) , and in fact , I do n't like it much . However , it looks to me like the most-Frequently Asked Question which was not previously covered in this list . The following is a list of newsgroups and the like where one could go to find out about GIF . Subject : alt.binaries.pictures FAQ - General info Subject : alt.binaries.pictures FAQ - OS specific info Newsgroups : alt.binaries.pictures.d , alt.binaries.pictures.misc , alt.binaries.pictures.utilities , alt.binaries.pictures.fractals , alt.binaries.pictures.fine-art.d , news.answers Available in the indicated USENET newsgroup ( s ) , or via anonymous ftp from pit-manager.mit.edu in the files : /pub/usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part1 /pub/usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part2 Also available from mail-server @ pit-manager.mit.edu by sending a mail message containing any or all of : send usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part1 send usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part2 Send a message containing `` help '' to get general information about the mail server . Also , you could check out the resources described in sections 7 , 8 , and 20 above for more information . 22 ) What is morphing ? Warping is the deformation of an image by mapping each pixel to a new location . Morphing is blending from one image or object to another one . Valerie Hall has written an excellent introduction to warping and morphing . This is available for anonymous ftp from marsh.cs.curtin.edu.au in the directory pub/graphics/bibliography/Morph . There are three files : morph_intro.ps.Z ( PostScript version , many pictures - 1.5M ) morph_intro.txt.Z ( text version ) m_responses.Z ( Responses to morphing questions ) The files are compressed , so you must use binary transfer and uncompress them afterwards . 23 ) How to ray-trace height fields Height fields are a special case in ray-tracing . They have a number of uses , such as terrain rendering , and some optimization is possible . Thus , they get their own FAQ section . Note that further references can no doubt be located via the ray-tracing bibs in section 16 above . The following paper seems to be the definitive reference : F. Kenton Musgrave Grid Tracing : Fast Ray Tracing For Height Fields July , 1988 < musg88.ps.Z > This is available as `` Research Report YALEU/DCS/RR-639 '' from Yale University , it 's also in the SIGGRAPH '91 Fractal Modeling in 3D Computer Graphics and Imaging course notes , and ( best of all ) it 's available on the net : nic.funet.fi pub/sci/papers/musg88.ps.Z weedeater.math.yale.edu pub/Papers/musg88.ms.Z princeton.edu pub/Graphics/Papers/musg88.ms.Z coral.cs.jcu.edu.au graphics/papers/musg88.ps.Z gondwana.ecr.mu.OZ.AU pub/papers/musg88.ms.Z and musg88.ps.Z An implementation of this paper may be found in Rayshade .

Pn , not in the x-y plane , is given by Area ( Polygon ) = 1/2 * | N . Sigma { Pk x Pk+1 } | where N is the unit vector normal to the plane and P is a polygonal vertex . The . represents the dot product operator and the x represents the cross product operator . Sigma represents the summation operator . | | represents the absolute value operator . Pn+1 is equal to P0 . 25 ) How to join ACM/SIGGRAPH Probably the easiest way to join ACM/SIGGRAPH is to trot over to your local technical library and find a copy of Communications of the ACM . Somewhere within the first few pages will be an application blank . Fill it out and mail it in . ACM membership for students costs $ 23.00 , Voting or Associate Membership $ 77.00 ( yearly ) SIGGRAPH student membership costs an additional $ 16.00 , $ 26.00 for Voting or Associate Members ( also yearly ) . To get TOG ( Transactions on Graphics ) it 's another $ 26.00 for students and $ 31.00 for Voting or Associate Members . If you just want to join SIGGRAPH without joining ACM , it 'll cost you $ 59.00 ( no student discount ) . There are surcharges for overseas airmailing of publications .

Organization : The Ohio State University Lines : 31 NNTP-Posting-Host : charm.magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu I am working with Visual Basic v2.0 for windows . Specifically , I am working on an application that generates formatted reports . Since , some of these reports can be rather large , my first question is : 1 . Is there a way to increase the size of a list box or text box in Visual Basic/windows beyond the 64k limit ? As I have not ( as yet - being optimistic : - ) come across a way to get around the above problem , I am working on the following approach : I am trying to create my own defined template in MS-Word , using the WordBasic Macros so that I can open up Word from Visual Basic ( VB ) and load this template of mine , which will work in the following way : It will first open MyOwn.INI file ( created in VB - at the time when the user selected the kind of report he weanted ) and read the section from the .INI file and jump to the appropriate code in template - which will then open and read a file pertaining to the section it read from the .INI file . 1 . When using the GetProfileString function in WordBasic , is there a way to specify/change the default .INI file ( which is win.ini ) to MyOwn.INI file ? 2 . When using the file Input $ function in WordBasic - is there a way to read more than the 32k at one time ? -- - Any help will be appreciated . pgupta @ magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu

I guess I edited my note on this away from the article I posted to many newsgroups . I wrote something about making color modifications quickly with 8bit quantized images and only at the saving the image to file process we have to make the modifications to the 24bit image . This makes sense , because the main use of XV is only viewing images . Doing many changes to image , we should keep all modifications in a buffer ; and then before making the operations to 24bit image , we should simplify the operation list for unnecessary operations . > And lastly , JPEG is a compression algorithm . It can be applied to any > image of arbitrary bit depth . Again , this is not a bug . Never claimed it is a bug . I tried kept sure I do n't claim that JPEG is noting else than a compression algorithm , because I know what the JPEG is .

In some earlier discussions on this thread I may have given the impression that even though children did n't require baptism it would n't hurt if they were . To the contrary , when you baptize children before they are capable of comprehending it you deny them their opportunity to demonstrate their desire to serve God . Have any of you considered that children are not accountable for sin because they are not capable of repentance ? Peter said to a group of `` men and brethren , '' `` Repent and be baptized every one of you '' ( Acts 2:38 ) . Notice that he specified that if they *repent* then they may be *baptized* . In following Peter 's instructions people must first demonstrate repentance ( a forsaking of their sins and a desire to obey God 's commands ) *before* they are eligible to be baptized . Since young children are not capable of repenting , they are not eligible for baptism . And since God is both just and merciful `` sin is not imputed when there is no law '' ( Romans 5:13 ) , young children are not accountable for what they ca n't comprehend . A IDLER

InfoWorld ( April 26 , 1993 issue ) has two articles about problems with DOS 6 . A 'Second Look ' article calls it a 'loaded gun ' and that people should exercise extreme caution if they decide to use it . The point out that DoubleSpace and MemMaker are both problem areas that will cause a number of folks problems . MS 's response was to the effect that there had been no problems reported that they could duplicate ( probably are not trying too hard ) . Cringely reports that a lot of folks are getting/going to get burned on the 900 support lines - his example was a call that cost $ 67.50 , for 3 minutes of tech support after 25 minutes on hold . I want to see the MS spin doctors explain this .

I am looking for any material related to the field , and am also trying to get my hands on some easy to use packages related to the field . In particular source code for general use packages . I already have several texts on the subject , but would appreciate more input from people more knowledgable in the field than myself . I 'm not mathematically literate ( ie . I do n't have a degree in mathematics ) , so any material that is suggested I would prefer that it was not mathematically intensive . The best book I have found on the subject at the moment is : '' Practical Digital Image Processing '' by Rhys Lewis ISBN : 0-13-683525-2 Published by Ellis Horwood ( c ) 1990 . Likewise I am trying to get a fair sample of programs that demonstrate Image Processing techniques . So far I have 'xv ' , and 'khoros ' for Unix . 'Dcview 2.1 ' for the IBM PC , and various related smatterings of C code to help describe topics like , contrasting , dithering , image enhancement via convolution etc . If anyone could kindly supply me with some public domain software pertinent to this area , or better still if they could tell me where I am most likely to find it on the AARNET ( Internet ) . If I can I would prefer source code in C or Turbo Pascal that includes some Image Processing code/algorithms , that I can readily alter/manipulate for the purposes of demonstration it would be most helpful . All the above information will contribute to my post-graduate studies , and will be liberally used in my paper , and seminar on the subject .

For if they had > had previous lives , it would not make sense to say , `` Neither of them > has done anything good or bad as yet , since they are not yet born . '' > Paul 's statement only asserts that that particular choice was not a matter of karmic fulfillment of the past , just as the fate of the man born blind ( John 9 ) was not . There is no question here of the simplistic idea of karma as a machine that is the sole determiner of one 's destiny . Even the eastern traditions , or many of them , do not say that , as one knowledgeable poster pointed out . And if in fact that Paul did not know about or believe in reincarnation does not say anything one way or another about it . Even John the Baptist , who Jesus says emphatically is Elijah ( Matt 11:14 ) , does not appear to have been aware of it , at least at the point at which he was asked . But it is interesting that his threefold denial -- to the question whether he is the Christ , the Prophet ( i.e . Isaiah ) , or Elijah , is emphatic in the first case and very weak in the third . I would like to add once again that , while it is important to discuss the different passages that may point directly to the teaching of repeated earth lives , one way or another , what I really see as important in our time is that the subject be revisited in terms of the larger view of Christianity and Christian doctrine . For the most part , those who do accept it either reject the central ideas of Christianity or , if they are Christians , hold their conviction as a kind of separate treasure . I believe that Christianity has important new understanding to bring to bear on it , and vice versa , much that is central to Christianity takes on entirely new dimensions of meaning in light of repeated earth lives . It has a direct bearing on many of the issues frequently discussed in this newsgroup in particular . I have said openly that I have developed my views of repeated earth lives largely from the work of Rudolf Steiner . Not that I hold him as an authority , but the whole picture of Christianity becomes clearer in light of these ideas . Steiner indicated that the old consciousness of reincar- nation necessarily had to fade away that it could be renewed in later times , after a time of development of the Christ idea through the first two millenia after Christ 's deed on Golgotha . In our own time , it becomes important that , having received the basic gospel of salvation , our understanding of life and of the human being can now grow to embrace the significance of this idea . For the discussions in this newsgroup , I have tried to focus on that which can be related as directly as possible to scripture and to fundamental Christian teaching and tradition .

Let 's see . Do I have a right to unpolluted air ? No , because the majority drive cars and use goods that create air pollution in the manufacturing process . Do I have the right to clean water ? I guess not , by the same reasoning . I could go on with these examples for a long time ... . Look at Nazi Germany . Because of the majority , Jews , homosexuals , blacks , and others that were different had no rights . In fact they were terrorized , imprisoned , and slaughtered . In this country did blacks have the right to be free from slavery ? I guess not , because the majority said that slavery was good for them . I think that a right has a moral imperative . If a law , imposed by the majority , is immoral , one should not follow it . In fact , one should do everything in his/her power to stop it . Of course , that does n't mean that I would lose all common sense to break the law , just because I thought it was immoral . I pay my Federal Income Tax even though I am morally opposed to the U.S. Government taking my money and spending it on weapons of mass destruction and terrorism . This is precisely the point I am trying to make . We should _persude_ people by logic , pointing out that it is in their self-interest to let all have equal rights in all aspects of life , including adequate housing , food , and medical care . I just happen to think that for a full life the aesthetic of beauty and joy is also necessary . That is why I consider an uncluttered night sky a right . Have you ever been out in the desert , away from local lights , and most people ? The sky is dark and transparent . The Milky Way is ablaze with more detail than you thought possible . The beauty and wonder takes your breath away . Now imagine you live in the worst ghetto , say in L.A. Due to light pollution you have never seen a dark sky . You might in fact never , not in your whole life , ever see the majesty of the night sky . Every where around you , you see squalor , and through your life runs a thread of dispair . What is there to live for ? I admit these two scenarios are extreme examples , but I have seen both . I , for one , need dreams and hopes , and yes , beauty , as a reason for living . That is why I consider an uncluttered night sky a right .

Perhaps the moderator might give again the instructions for retrieving the FAQ on this topic ? BTW , this issue , while dealt with before , is VERY timely . One of the major Presbyterian churches in California ( St. Andrews -- a MegaChurch in a rich neighborhood ) is withholding their support of Synod ( amounts to about 10 % of the budget of the Synod , which covers all of Southern CA and Hawaii ) until support for a pro-homosexual lobbying group ( the Lazarus Project ) is terminated . [ This came from a news report on CNN yesterday -- corrections welcome . ] Tim [ I think it 's time for me to post the FAQ . This is an issue throughout the Presbyterian Church . On the other side , one of the major churches in Cincinnati has been ordaining homosexual elders , and has ignored Presbytery instructions not to do so . And the church in Rochester where the judicial commission said they could n't install a homosexual pastor has made her an '' evangelist '' .

I ca n't stand it ! Aside from frustrated ravings , I must give Buffalo credit : they are making good on most of their scoring opportunities , and are playing great defense . Boston players ca n't seem to get control of the puck anywhere near the Buffalo net except for on rare occasions . The Buffalo defense is also doing an excellent job clearing away rebounds . Fuhr is playing great when the big save is needed but he 's also getting plenty of help . Boston has been playing rather well ( better than would be indicated by the series score of 3-0 ) but is lacking that extra drive in the earlier part of the game . As a result , Boston keeps leaving the ice at the end of the 1st period 2 goals down . This MUST stop if Boston is to have any hope of winning a single game ( the outlook for the Bruin 's advancement to the second round are quite bleak ) . IMHO , the Bruins NEED to score first . If they can do that , they have an excellent chance of winning , since they have outplayed the Sabres in the 2nd and 3rd periods . ( The scary thing is that I 'll be going to grad school in Buffalo next year . I 'll never cheer for the Sabres ...

The reason for the colour of the boards depends on the solder mask that is used . Older boards ( bakelite and phenolic ) rarely used a solder mask ( these boards are not suited well to automatic stuffing and soldering techniques ) and hence are the colour of the compound used to make them . These days boards are made of fibreglass for most general purpose uses and have a solder mask applied to them to prevent close traces shorting to one another during soldering ( and also to prevent the decomposition of traces under harsh environments ) . The light and dark green boards ofter seen have a `` dry film '' mask applied to them ( usually applied as a complete film photographically produced ) . The blue ( and red or orange ) boards are a two-part epoxy or a liquid-imageable resist formulation and are applied in a different manner .

Well , I say , get them the hell out of there if you're worried for them , but do n't deny Bosnians their basic right to self defense ! Lift the embargo against Bosnia , and let them defend themselves . What makes the UN troops more valuable than the Bosnian people ? They are letting the civilians die so the soldiers could survive , when if anything , it should be the other way around . Idiots like Owen expect Bosnians to swallow a forced plan , and just hope this problem will go away . Well they 're wrong . If they had got their butts in gear ( that is , if Bosnia had oil ) a year ago , much of this could be prevented . Now , however , the results of this tragedy will last for generations . That 's like forcing the jews to make peace with Hitler . Yeah right . This , as senator Biden said , reeks of bigotry , and makes me and any decent human being for that matter , quite sick . It should be the Europeans , not the Americans , who take the inititiative and ask the other for support . This is their backyard , not the Americans . Today it 's Bosnia , tomorrow it will be Kosovo and Macedonia , Greece , and then Turkey , and the damn thing will spread . Not to mention European muslims who were n't even practicing before will rally to fundamentalism . Good luck handling that , your majesty ! Owen was upset at the question which compared him to Chamberlain , who hoped to appease Hitler . He said that Chamberlain had been in Munich 2 years before any war , I have been here during a blazing war for the last 18 months . Well , that makes him even worse , because Chamberlain could have at least argued I 'm giving Germany the benefit of the doubt , whereas Owen ca n't even do that . What the west is doing is aiding the Serbs by tying the Bosnians ' hands , and making the stupid excuse of their powerless troops on the ground , who ca n't even protect the Bosnian foreign minister in their own armored vehicle , and watch the killers just walk away !

After Vizquel made that barehanded grab of the chopper up the middle , someone remarked that if he had fielded it with his glove , he would n't have had time to throw Riles out . Yet , the throw beat Riles by about two steps . I wonder how many others who watched the final out think Vizquel had no choice but to make the play with his bare hand . Does anybody think Vizquel was wrong to field the ball barehanded ? And if he failed to field it cleanly , would it ( or should it ) have been an error or a hit ? ( Judging from Bosio 's grimace when the ball bounced past him , he must have thought it would go through for a hit . ) Whether Vizquel was right or wrong , he certainly made one hell of a play . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Phil Brown | aka pb6755 @ csc.albany.edu | -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

One of major flaws of X is the horrendous number of transactions ( and hence process switches ) that it forces upon a host . Actual measurements ( hourly average ) are 5 per second per logged in user , which can lead to 20-50 or more process switches ( depending on whether each event is filtered by the window manager as well as the applications and how many processes are needed for each character . ) While a blinking cursor needs only the application and the networking process , and does not add any transactions , it will add something like 10 process switches per second per user . This is a significant increase in overhead , especially as the application may have quite a large working set . If you want a rapidly blinking cursor , there could be as many as 50 .

Gordon Rubenfeld did a Medline search and also sent me the same reference through e-mail . Since commercial yogurt does not always have a good Lactobacillus a. or bulgaricus culture , a negative finding would not have been too informative . This is often the reason why Lactobacillus acidophilus tablets are recommended rather than yogurt . I guess the next question is why would this introduction of `` good '' bacteria back into the gut decrease the incidence of vaginal candida blooms if the anus was not serving as a candida reservoir ( a fact that Gordon R. vehementy denys ) ? I see two possible theories . One , the L. acidophilus , which is a facultatively anaerobic bacterium , could make it through the gut and colonize the rectal area to overgrow the candida . This would not explain the reoccurance of candida blooms in the vagina after the yogurt ingestion was stopped though . The other is that the additional bacteria in the intestinal tract remove most of the glucose from the feces and candida looses it 's major food source . Getting Lactobacillus acidophilus to colonize the vaginal tract ( where it is normally found ) would have a much better effect on the recurrance of vaginal yeast blooms though . An acetic acid , Lactobacillus acidophilus douche has been used to get this effect but I 've not seen any such treatment reported in the medical literature . This would be an example of physicians conducting their own clinical trials to try to come up with treatments that help their patients . When this is done in private practice , the results are rarely , if ever published . It was the hallmark of medicine until the modern age emerged with clinical trials . It really raises a big question . Does the medical profession cast out the adventerous few who try new treatments to help patients or does it look the other way . This particular issue is really a very simple one since no real dangerous therapy is involved ( even the anti-fungals are not all that dangerous ) . But there are some areas ( like EDTA chelation therapy ) , where the fire is pretty hot and somebody could get burned . It 's really tough . Do I follow only well established protocols and then give up if they do n't work that well or do it try something that looks like it will work but has n't been proven to work yet ? My stand is to consider other treatment possibilities , especially if they involve little or no risk to the patient . Getting good bacteria back into the gut after antibiotic treatment is one treatment possibility . The other is getting L. acidophilus into the vaginal tract of a woman who is having a problem with recurring yeast infections . Marty B .

Belligerence , genocide , back-stabbing , rebelliousness and disloyalty have been the hallmarks of the Armenian history .

I do n't have a calculator , but I DO have the problem set that we did not too long ago , so I 'll use that , and hope it 's what you wanted . This is a highly simplified problem , with a very simple burst . Bursts are usually more complex than this example I will use here . Our burst has a peak flux of 5.43E-6 ergs cm^-2 sec^-1 and a duration of 8.95 seconds . During the frst second of the burst , and the last 4 seconds , its flux is half of the peak flux . It 's flux is the peak flux the rest of the time . Assume that the background flux is 10E-7 erg cm^-2 sec^-1 . Then we had to find the integrated luminosity of the burst , for several different spheres : R=.25pc ( Oort Cloud Radius ) , R=22.5pc ( at the edge of the galaxy ) , R=183.5pc or the edge of the galactic corona , and lastly at a R=8800Mpc . We integrated the flux over all time to find the fluence , then used the old standby formula : Luminosity=4 ( pi ) ( r^2 ) Fpeak For a radius of .25 pc , we found an L around 10^32 erg/sec . Pretty energetic for close by . for the coronal model , we found around 10^43 erg/sec . And lastly , for the cosmological model an L=10^53 . That 's what you 'd call moderately energetic , I 'd say . Any suggestions about what could put out that much energy in one second ? -jeremy

From : brother.roy @ almac.co.uk ( Brother Roy ) Subject : RFD : soc.religion.taize Organization : Almac BBS Ltd. +44 ( 0 ) 324 665371 Lines : 114 NNTP-Posting-Host : rodan.uu.net This is a RFD on a proposal for a newsgroup which would promote a sharing on the `` Johannine hours '' as proposed each month by the monks of the ecumenical community of Taize ( pronounced te-zay ) in France . NAME OF PROPOSED NEWSGROUP : ========================== soc.religion.taize ( Unmoderated ) PURPOSE OF THE GROUP : ==================== The Taize Community is an international ecumenical community of monks based in France . Many young adults come there to search for meaning in their life and to deepen their understanding of their faith through a sharing with others . This newsgroup will allow such a sharing through a monthly `` Johannine Hour '' which will be posted at the beginning of each month . A `` Johannine hour '' involves a short commentary on a given Bible passage , followed by some questions for reflection . Any thoughts that may arise in consequence and that you wish to share with others can be posted here . We are not interested in theological debate , and even less in polemics . No expertise is required ! The idea is to help one another to deepen our understanding of Scripture as it is related to our own life-journey . The idea of `` Johannine hours '' was born in Taize as a simple response to all those who were trying to assimilate the Bible 's message in the midst of their daily life . Because of work or studies , it is often impossible to spend long hours in silence and reflection , but everyone can take an hour from time to time to enter a church , sit quietly at home or go out for a walk in the woods . There , in silence , we can meditate on a passage of Scripture to listen to the voice of Christ . During the time of silence , it is important to concentrate on what we understand and not waste time worrying if , in some Biblical expressions , we find it difficult to hear the voice of Christ . The idea is to communicate to others what we have understood of Christ , not burdening them with our own hesitations but rather telling them what has brought us joy , what has led us to run the risk of trusting more deeply . Perhaps those who read and think about the `` Johannine Hours '' in this newsgroup could share their reflections and discoveries with others . The important thing is the complementarity between two aspects , the personal aspect of silent , personal reflection and the communal aspect of sharing , which through Usenet makes us a part of a worldwide network . BACKGROUND OF THE TAIZE COMMUNITY : ================================= The following provides some background information on the life and vocation of the Taize ( pronounced te-zay ) community . `` A PARABLE OF COMMUNION '' : August 1940 , with Europe in the grip of World War II , Brother Roger , aged 25 , set up home in the almost abandoned village of Taize , in Eastern France . His dream : to bring together a monastic community which would live out `` a parable of community '' , a sign of reconciliation in the midst of the distress of the time . Centering his life on prayer , he used his house to conceal refugees , especially Jews fleeing from the Nazi occupation . AN INTERNATIONAL AND ECUMENICAL COMMUNITY : Taize 's founder spent the first two years alone . Others joined him later and at Easter 1949 , seven brothers committed themselves together to common life and celibacy . Year by year , still others have entered the community , each one making a lifelong commitment after several years of preparation . Today , there are 90 brothers , Catholics and from various Protestant backgrounds , from over twenty different countries . Some of them are living in small groups in poor neighbourhoods in Asia , Africa , North and South America . The brothers accept no donations or gifts for themselves , not even family inheritances , and the community holds no capital . The brothers earn their living and share with others entirely through their own work . In 1966 , Sisters of Saint Andrew , an international Catholic community founded 750 years ago , came to live in the neighbouring village , to share the responsibility of welcoming people in Taize . TAIZE AND THE YOUNG ; THE INTERCONTINENTAL MEETINGS : Young adults , and less young , have been coming to Taize in ever greater numbers since 1957 . Hundreds of thousands of people from Europe and far beyond have thus been brought together in a common search . Intercontinental meetings take place each week , Sunday to Sunday , throughout the year and they include youth from between 35 and 60 countries during any one week . The meetings give each person the opportunity to explore the roots of their faith and to reflect on how to unite the inner life and human solidarity . The meetings in summer can have up to 6,000 participants a week . Three times every day , the brothers and everybody on the hill come together for common prayer in the Church of Reconciliation , built in 1962 when the village church became too small . `` A PILGRIMAGE OF TRUST ON EARTH '' The community has never wanted to create a `` movement '' around itself . Instead , people are called to commit themselves in their church at home , in their neighbourhood , their city or village . To support them in this , Taize has created what it calls `` a pilgrimage of trust on earth '' . At the end of each year , the pilgrimage has a `` European meeting '' which brings together tens of thousands of young adults from every part of Europe for several days in a major city . There have also been meetings in Asia and in the United States . Every year , Brother Roger writes an open letter to the young . Usually completed during a stay in one of the poor regions of the world , these are translated into thirty languages and provide themes for reflexion for the following year . NOTE : Discussion on the creation of this newsgroup will take place in news.groups . For any further information contact : Brother.Roy @ almac.co.uk brother.roy @ almac.co.uk -- . 1st 1.10b # 332 .

Well , I had had similar reactions many times . That was when I really started WATCHING CAREFULLY - reaction to Doritos - hey guess what 's in there - reaction to Lawry 's season salt - guess what 's in THERE I 'll give you a hint - I 've had enough problems with MANY MANY MANY different products with MSG that I figured out one thing . UNLESS I plan on getting sick - I wo n't eat the stuff without my Seldane . And did I ever learn to read labels . > PLEASE note that I am NOT saying you are making it up , I am just > trying to point out that the situation is not always as simple as it > might seem . Which was why I started checking EVERY time I got sick . And EVERY time I got sick MSG was somehow involved in one of the food products . And consider there were no other similar ingredients ( to my knowledge ) - it might not please a medical researcher - but it pleased my own personal physician enough for him to give me allergy medicine and MOST IMPORTANTLY it 's enough proof for ME to avoid it ( and enough proof that my INCREDIBLY frugal fiance did n't flinch when I literally threw out or gave away all the food products in his pantry that had msg - and he always flinches when there 's waste - but it was a simple explanation - I wo n't eat this stuff , I WO N'T cook with this stuff , so I can either throw it out or give it away . ) > From : pattee @ ucsu.Colorado.EDU ( Donna Pattee ) > My guess was that the spice mix on the fries contained MSG , Probably Lawry 's seasoning salt .

How many people would have to be tested that would have a problem ? Also - I KNOW I have a problem with it , and I would n't VOLUNTEER for a test . Like thanks guys but I do n't WANT to get sick . Also - I 'm sure that most people probably have varying degrees of sensitivities at different times .

One more way , which works in manual trans cars I 've driven , and it is my personal favorite ( the other suggestions above are great , but try this one , too ) .

Looking at your discussion I would say that you both operate from your own reference frame . There 's no inside and no outside , there are just two polarized views . As for statements inside the Bible , things are still not that clear , we do n't have any indications for instance why Jobs was placed in the Old Testament , one of the few books that actually talks about Satan . Jobs is very much out of line with the rest of the OT books , and there 's a chance that someone added this book later into the group of OT scriptures . > Now in your sense , Kent , of sensing reality -- that is a different > matter .

This operates the other way around as well . You have to understand the mind of an atheist , agnostic , or as in my case , a radical relativist . If you do n't understand the underlying concepts , it is pretty hard to continue with a dialogue . I 'm not a perfect Christian , however about 20+ years of Christian teaching should have provided me with a pretty good picture of the Christian mind frame .

Nntp-Posting-Host : summit.wpd.sgi.com Organization : Silicon Graphics , Inc. , Mountain View , CA Lines : 22 I like the Clark-WIlliams-Bonds order . Pitchers can only walk Clark with 2 outs ( unlike last year ) . Williams is getting better pitches to hit with Bonds looming in the on-deck circle . Since Matt has a terrible batting eye , this helps the Giants a lot . When Bonds gets on base all by himself , he can try to steal 2nd and then be driven in with a single by Thompson , Manwaring , or Clayton . If you bat Bonds before the other sluggers , then you do n't want him to run because a `` caught stealing '' could take you out of a big inning . Also Bonds is less in need of protection behind him because he is such a good base stealer ( a walk is a potential double ) . The only draw back is when Clark and Williams are clogging up the bases infront of Bonds ... and I think that 's a problem the Giants will be glad to see especially if Robby Thompson gets hot .

From : rhaller @ ns.uoregon.edu ( Rich Haller ) Subject : Resound Hearing aids ( and others ) Organization : University of Oregon Lines : 31 Distribution : world NNTP-Posting-Host : rhaller.cc.uoregon.edu I have a fairly severe high frequency hearing loss . A recent rough test showed a gently sloping loss to 10-20db down at 1000cps . Then it falls off a cliff to 70-80dbs down from 1500cps on . This type of loss is difficult to fit . I am currently using some old siemens behind the ear aids which keep me roughly functional , but leave a lot to be desired . Recently I had an opportunity to test the Widex Q8 behind the ear aids for several weeks . These have four independent programs which are intended to be customized for different hearing situations and can be reprogramed . I found them to be a definite improvement over my current aids and was about to go ahead with them until another local outfit advertised a free trial of another programmable system called ReSound . Unfortunately I was only able to try the ReSound aids in their office for about 30 minutes and I could n't compare them 'head to head ' with the Widex . Nevertheless , it did appear to me that they were superior and I was impressed by what I was able to read about the theory behind them which I will give in a separate posting . They also carry the Widex aids and had one patient ( presumably wealthy ) who decided to go ahead and get the ReSound even though he had purchased the Widex only 6 months ago . The problem is that the ReSound aids are about twice as expensive as the Widex and other programmable aids . I could take a trip to Europe on the difference ! Being a lover of bargains and hating to spend money , I am having a hard time persuading myself to go with the ReSounds . I would appreciate any opinions on this and other hearing aids and projections about when and if I might see improvements in technology that are n't quite so expensive . -Rich Haller < rhaller @ ns.uoregon.edu > University of Oregon , Eugene , OR , USA

To hear LaVey say it , only idiots and fools believe in Satan > and or Allah . He knew that suckers are born every minute . > > -- - Maximus 2.01wb Anton LaVey 's interpretation of Satanism has always puzzled me . I read his `` Satanic Bible '' a few years ago for a social studies project , as well as a book by Arthur Lyons called `` The Cult of Devil Worship in America . '' The latter included a very interesting interview with the Black Pope in which he did indeed say that Satan was merely an instrument for one to realize the self . When I refer to Satanism , I am referring to the mishmash of rural Satanic ritualism and witchcraft which existed before the Church of Satan . I do n't consider LaVey 's church to be at all `` orthodox , '' nor do I consider its followers `` satanists . '' LaVey combined the philosophies of Nietzsche , Crowley , and Reich , slapped in some religious doctrine , added a little touch of P.T . Barnum , and christened his creation the Church of Satan . No doubt the title was a calculated attempt to attract attention ... I suppose he could have just as easily called it the Church of Free Sex . At any rate , it worked ( for a while ) . In its heyday , the Church had a huge following , including such Hollywood celebrities as Sammy Davis , Jr. and Jayne Mansfield . ( I have a picture of LaVey with Sammy , by the way . ) I find the idea of a Satanist not believing in Satan about as credible as a Christian not believing in Christ . But if you include the Church of Satan , then I suppose I need to alter my definition . Webster 's Dictionary and The American Heritage Dictionary will have to do the same . -- -- - __ _______ -- - ||| Kevin Marshall \ \/ /_ _/ Computer Science Department ||| ||| Virginia Tech \ / / / marshall @ csugrad.cs.vt.edu ||| -- - Blacksburg , Virginia \/ /_/ ( 703 ) 232-6529 -- -

From : kayman @ Xenon.Stanford.EDU ( Robert Kayman ) Subject : SUMMARY : Canon BJ200 vs. HP DeskJet 500 Organization : Computer Science Department , Stanford University . Lines : 401 Hello again , About a week and one-half ago I posted a query looking for people feelings on the inkjet family of printers . Specifically , a comparison between the Canon BJ200 ( BubbleJet ) and the Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 500 . Many people asked me to post the summary/account of all the postings and e-mail I received . Below is my original query and the responses I received . I have not deleted any part of the responses , only the headers and signatures , so you can extract what you find necessary . Some people asked me for an unbiased account ; however , the very nature of the question suggests favoritism and biased comments , you must extract the information you believe unbiased and a fair representation of each printer . There are a wide range of comments , each has its own value . There was no clear winner , some like the BJ200 ( especially its price/performance ratio ) , others preferred the durability and reliability of the DeskJet ( the original inkjet with proven drivers and a solid background ) . Two new inkjet printers have drawn some attention , a new printer to be introduced by Hewlett-Packard later this year ( around summertime ) , and an addition to the Epson product line ( their first inkjet ) . You will find that after the initial purchase , the costs of re-filling or replacing the ink cartridges are about the same ( this largely depends on where you purchase the re-fills or replacements -- so shop around first since this aspect will most likely dominate the cost of your printer ) . No one mentioned approx . how many sheets each ink cartridge will print , but I suspect they are roughly equal at about 1000 - 1500 sheets ( laser printers will do 4000-5000 sheets per toner cartridge ) . Well , that 's a brief research summary of my personal research .

Just using regular copier paper produced fantastic results just in high quality mode . I compared the output of a Micrografx Designer legal size drawing with 4pt type done on my BJ 200 with the same drawing printed on an HP Laserjet IID and I was amazed how well I could read the small print on the BJ 200 . Printing speed was several seconds faster on the BJ 200 which is amazing considering that the HP has 2.5M ram installed . I measured the time from when the printer first indicated it was receiving data ( as I used print manager in Windows ) . I showed the output to several people at work and one manager bought one immediately for his office , and two other engineers placed their orders too . If you need CDW 's phone number , it 's 800-598-4239 . Delivery to NY was two days . Good luck ! Craig Witkowski , CENG51 @ maccvm.corp.mot.com Motorola Communications & Electronics Inc. Glen Rock , NJ =========================================================================== I own a Deskjet 500 . Performance is n't spectacular under Windows using TrueType fonts but neither is the Canon from what I have seen . Quality for the HP is very much dependent on paper quality - on 'standard ' photo-copy paper the characters have slightly 'frayed ' edges but on better quality 'distinction ' type paper things look better . For most applications I find copy paper fine - still better than dot-matrix . Comes with a Windows driver , which seems to by-pass print manager , has a few 'intelli-fonts'which are HP scaleable fonts - probably faster than TrueType but have n't really tried them out . Can get RAM & FONT cartridges but unless the speed of TrueType is a problem I would n't bother . The RAM cartridges ca n't be used as buffer - soft fonts only . For graphics , i.e . BMP images etc the HP can be put into a dither mode via the HP supplied Win driver . There a number of dither options such as 'scatter ' , 'pattern ' etc . The manual gives recommendations depending on the type of image being printed . Text is not so good in this mode . Problem arises when you have a document which contains both graphic and text . The range of tones for graphic images is n't brilliant but I think that is more of a limitation with inkjet printers in general . > From what I have seen the Canon is similar in most respects . However , a printer definitely worth looking at is the new inkjet from Epson . This printer is faster , cheaper , and capable of producing laser-like quality on normal copier paper . Ca n't remember the model # , LX - something I think ? I purchased my HP days before the Epson was released here : - { . The introductory price on the Epson was the same as the HP here in New Zealand . =========================================================================== About a month ago , I got a Canon BJ200 . I absolutely LOVE it . It is incredibly fast , except for printing from PSPICE ( I do n't know if you ever do stuff with that or not . ) Most of the stuff I print is either from Microsoft Word for Windows or just plain text . The only problems I 've had are printing headers/footers ( the printer freaked out ) , and printing on cheap paper ( lots of streaks ) . Normal copy paper works great with it , you can only tell it 's not laser-printed by holding it , oh , less than twelve inches from your face . ( That is , if you 're nearsighted , like me ! : ) ) The printer comes with its own driver for Windows 3.1 ! ! I have no other complaints . The printer also can act just like some EPSON or another for those archaic software packages that have n't written a driver for it yet . The teeny-weeny footprint is a real plus , too -- AND , if you purchase it between now and May 31 , you get a $ 50 rebate from Canon ! ! I bought mine from a store called CompUSA , and the price now is $ 340 . I have a friend who has the HP you are looking at . It also prints very well , and everyone has drivers for it , BUT it is VERY slow ! Hope I helped !

I prefer the Deskjet . The printing speed and quality are similar ( I tested both with text and graphics before buying the Deskjet for home ) . The feature that sets the Deskjet apart is the driver support in so many applications . The BJ ends up emulating the Epson LQ or IBM Proprinter to get it to work with many non-windows apps and this will be the case for a long time . The design is superior if you just want to use cut paper , the Deskjet is quieter , AND the ink cartridges are quite a bit cheaper due to the number of Deskjets out there in comparision to the BJs . Just my $ 0.02 worth.. -- Mike Mattix Agricultural Group of Monsanto P.O . Box 174 Luling , LA 70070 INTERNET Address : dmmatt @ bigez.monsanto.com =========================================================================== Yes , there is the landscape mode printing problem , but it does not present a problem in Windows as the Windows printer driver handles the translation . I actually thought of some other points after I posted the note . The Deskjet has an unprintable area of approximately .5inch around the paper the Bubblejet does not . You are right about the graphics resolutions , I tested the printers with the applications I had access to : Wordperfect , Harvard Graphics , WinGIF , Paintshop PRO , and Paintbrush and could not tell a difference . In fact one of the HP Deskjet Windows drivers gives you significant control over the contrast and density of the printer hence controlling the amount of ink you put down . The Bubblejet did not . I had no imaging software to test the printers with and so had no comparision there . Finally , I wanted sheet feeding . In that configuration the Bubblejet cost approximately $ 100 more than the Deskjet . I went through a pretty thorough evaluation and chose the Deskjet when I spent my own money . BTW , I am replacing the BJ-300 with a Deskjet 500 at work this month anyway . Regards Mike Mattix Ag Group of Monsanto Luling , LA =========================================================================== I spent some time comparing the two . We ended up getting the Bubblejet BJ-200 versus the HP . Our reasons were : 1 ) The HP seemed to have worse banding than the Canon 2 ) 360dpi versus 300 - we felt we could see the difference 3 ) Price - Canon has a $ 50 rebate program going on at the moment . The BJ-200 was our choice over the BJ-10ex - we could have 100 pages in the BJ-200 feeder . The BJ-10ex holds only 30 pages , I think . As you can see , up to 100 pages on the BJ-200 . We have n't done anything big with the BJ , but its performance seems reasonable under Windows . I know that the Microsoft BBS has a newer windows driver than comes with the printer , but I do n't know how it compares ( also the driver included with the printer is Canon 's whereas I do n't know where the Microsoft BBS one comes from - Microsoft ? ) Hope this helps . -- Thomas V. Frauenhofer , WA2YYW tvf @ cci.com , ... ! uunet ! uupsi ! cci632 ! tvf , tvf @ cs.rit.edu Mandlebratwurst : The Meal that Eats Itself ! =========================================================================== Altough I 'm sometimes also a salesperson ( if I 'm not suppost to study : - ) ) I would recommend to buy the BJ200 . The printing quality is a bit better , but you you 've got much more possiblities . Do n't forget the HP engine is at least 2 years on the marked , the Canon engine ( witch is also used in other `` new '' bubblejet printers like e.g . the Epson ones ) is quite recently available.. > Now , I would greatly appreciate any information you could render on the 360 > dpi of the Canon BubbleJet vs. the Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 500 ( 300 dpi ) . > Which is faster ?

Which will handle large documents better ( 75 I 've seen during a short demonstration ( from someone who tryed to sell me Canon printers ) 2 times the same picture , one printed with the BJ200 , one with the Canon , the other with the HP , and.. there was a difference in printing- quality , .. The Canon was a bit better.. Greetz , Kris =========================================================================== When we decided we needed quiet printers in our hospital we looked to inkjet printers . They have near laser quality , speed , and they are quiet . We use both HP Deskjets and the Canon BJ-200s . I prefer the paper handling qualities of the Deskjets but I feel the Canons have superior print quality . The Ideal would be a Canon with a sheet feeder , however I did end up buying a deskjet for home use ( got too good a deal ) . Anyway , we are using Canons in high volume areas and they are holding up very well . Out of 15 Deskjets and 4 BJ-200s I have only had one problem with a deskjet and that was taken care of very quickly by HP . -Nate =========================================================================== Whenever I buy anything I look at what the `` experts '' say , pick out the top few and then buy on whatever criteria are the most apt . I 've been unusually flush lately ( no begging letter please ) and so I 've done this a few times including - about four months ago - with inkjet printers . I ca n't remember much about the process except that I read about three reviews of inkjets and that the 500 was always at or near the top . I bought the 500C because of the added dimension of colour ( I intend to build a multi- media machine at some stage and have just bought a colour scanner towards that ) . Although I haven 's used the colour thing in earnest yet I tried it out on a couple of Windows bitmaps and I was pleased with the result . I note that even though you can now get the 550C ( the one with both colour and mono with no need to change the cartridge ) , the 500C and 500 are still readily available ( at least in the UK ) . The following are my views/experience : 1 . I do n't know anything about the Canon except that I came away from reviews ( and replies to a posting similar to yours ) with the idea that the HP offered the best performance/price ratio . 2 . I believe HP are the originals in the field - not always the ideal place to be but the market 's still young so one assumes they have the expertise . 3 . The 500C is worth the extra . Operation in mono is perfectly acceptable and I get good crisp reproduction of fonts from Windows . 4 . I used to work for Monotype when they still manufactured typesetters ( before their AMERICAN owners closed them down ! ) and I can tell you that in terms of definition 300 dpi is pretty poor anyway so 360 dpi is just a bit less poor ... 5 . The HP comes with a reasonable set of drivers . 6 . If you buy it invest in the additional RAM pack - it 's pretty slow with it , God knows what it 's like without ! I actually work in Germany and my PC is home in the UK so it 's not in daily use . I would say that apart from my not reading the manual properly and having a really dumb problem at the start it 's easy peasy to operate . Hope this is of use . Regards David =========================================================================== Just bought the BJ-200 . I thought the price could n't be beat ( $ 329 , with $ 50 rebate thru 5/31 ) and so far it is comparable , even superior , to the DeskJet in print quality . Speed : Per page rate seems to be faster ( I do n't have figures ) . I do n't print long docs , though . Quality : I think the graphics quality is excellent . Print quality is excellent as well , unless you use small fonts and hold it up close ; you can see a lot more `` jaggies '' than on a LaserJet . The 360 dpi is offset by a little less accuracy in holding the page/print head in place , I would imagine . Large docs : Not room in the standard model for a whole lotta pages ... manual says up to 100 , though . Have n't tried it . Drivers : No problems under Win3.1 yet . WinWord does n't want to print the envelopes the same way the Canon does , though . Know nothing of add-on costs . Daniel A.

I just bought a BJ-200 printer a couple of days ago . I compared it to the sample print of an HP DeskJet 500 and knew that the HP was n't for me . The BJ-200 is pretty fast and really prints with good quality . I can compare it with the HP LaserJet IIID PostScript and they look almost identical ( depending on the kind of paper ) . I do n't have problems with the ink not being dry , it seems to dry VERY fast . Probably within a second . Since Canon is giving a $ 50 rebate until the end of May , it is really a good buy . -- - Sean Eckton Computer Support Representative College of Fine Arts and Communications =========================================================================== Wow , it 's funny you should ask this . I 'm a little behind in news reading so I know this may be late . I just purchased the Canon Bubblejet last night . I was really worried that I would n't like it but the print quality , and noise level is fantastic ! I printed quite a few documents with lots of graphics and it printed DAMN near laser quality . You ca n't tell it 's not laser unless you get 2 inches from the page . no problems with drivers . The printer came with the driver diskette which is good because I was beginning to panic when I could n't findi it under Windows or WordPerfect . It works well under both . I have yet to install Word for Windows so do n't know how it works with them . I had a DeskJet 500 at work last year . It was a good printer as well ut I felt it was awfully slow . And much noisier than the BubbleJet . I won't say the BubbleJet is MUCH better , but I really do like it more .

Rushdie was writing about a crisis of faith , and chose this myth to present it , by placing the actor `` Gibreel '' in the role of the angel whose name he took . Rushdie was not writing a history or theology book , and nowhere claims or implies that this is what actually happened . It 's somewhat like stories woven around the relationship between Jesus and the reformed prostitute Mary Magdalene ( another myth ) . Or those referring to the Arthurian mythos , or the Grail legend , or the Wandering Jew , or dozens of others . If you can stand to read the work of a blasphemer , consider Salman Rushdie 's children 's book `` Haroun and the Sea of Stories '' for an idea of the way a storyteller -- a specific storyteller -- works with existing story lines . > to ridicule Muhammad 's integrity ... No . Muhammad 's [ Mahound 's ] integrity is not really impugned in this part of the story , and there 's no reason to think this was Rushdie's intent : Gibreel , as the archangel , produces the verses ( divine and satanic ) , though he does n't know their provenance . It is not implied ( in a straight reading ) that Muhammad influences them : `` *Not my voice* I 'd never know such words I 'm no classy speaker never was never will be but this is n't my voice it 's a Voice . Mahound 's eyes open wide , he 's seeing some kind of vision , staring at it , oh , that 's right , Gibreel remembers , me . He's seeing me . My lips moving , being moved by . What , whom ? Don't know , ca n't say . Nevertheless , here they are , coming out of my mouth , up my throat , past my teeth : the Words . Being God 's postman is no fun , yaar . Butbutbut : God is n't in this picture . God knows whose postman I 've been . '' It 's ambiguous : is Mahound somehow manipulating Gibreel ? Is it Satan ? Or something else ? The answer is not given . To be sure , the question is raised . This novel explores faith and the role of revelation in religion , among other things . Addressing loss of faith implicitly raises questions about the truth of revelation , but this novel proposes no answers , at least not directly . The very existence of a newsgroup named `` alt.atheism '' raises the same questions , more forcefully , and does propose some answers , which is the real relevance . If Rushdie 's mild fictional exploration is `` filth and lies '' , and he `` asked for what he got '' , are we next on the fatwa list ?

Convenient ? It seems very appropriate that this is cross-posted to alt.conspiracy . Assuming the most favorable interpretation of your '1000 degree' measurement ( that the temperature is in Centigrade , rather than the more common -in the US- Fahrenheit ) , you are still laboring under at least 2 misconceptions : 1 . You seem to believe that steel melts somewhere around 1000 C. Actually , the melting point of most iron alloys ( and steels are iron alloys ) is in the neighborhood of 1400 C. Even if the gun were found in area which achieved the 1000 C temperature , the steel parts of the gun would not be deformed , and it would still be trivial to identify the nature of the weapon . 2 . A fire is not an isothermal process . There are 'hot ' spots and 'cold ' spots , though 'cold ' is purely a relative term . So the weapon was not necessarily situated in a hot spot , as you seem to imply . And , even if it was , so what ? It would not have melted anyway . darin wilkins @ scubed.com ________________________________ | | | I will be President for food | |______________________________|

Speaking of SIGGRAPH , I just went through the ordeal of my annual registration for SIGGRAPH and re-upping of membership in the ACM last night , and was I ever grossed out ! The new prices for membership are almost highway robbery ! For example : SIGGRAPH basic fee went from $ 26 last year to $ 59 this year for the same thing , a 127 % increase . Those facile enough to arrange a trip to the annual conference could reduce this to $ 27 by selecting SIGGRAPH Lite , which means SIGGRAPH is charging an additional $ 32 ( or so ) for the proceedings and the art show catalog , essentially . TOPLAS went up 40 % in cost , way outstripping the current inflation rate . Basic SIGCHI fees remainded the same , but whereas before SIGCHI membership included UIST and Human Factors conferences proceedings , these are now an extra cost option . Bundling that back into the basic rate , equivalent services have gone up 100 % in cost . SIGOIS membership cost has up 33 % , but they 've also split out the Computer Supported Cooperative Work conference proceedings that used to be included with membership . Adding that cost back in means this SIG also has doubled its membership fee . What really galls me is that the ACM sent out brochures a couple months ago touting their new approach to providing member services , and tried to make it sound like they were offering NEW services . But with the exception of a couple , like SIGGRAPH , all the `` plus '' services appear to be just splitting the costs into smaller piles so that they do n't look so big . But their recommended changes to my membership would have me paying 90 % more than last year for a 31 % increase in services ( measured by cost , not by value ) , and , curiously , a 31 % inflation rate on the publications I got last year .

The crushed remains of a PRESSURIZED propane tank were found in the ruins of the BD compound . The key word is PRESSURIZED . When that baby was crushed , the gas would have gone all over the place . And when ignited , would look just like the pictures of the explosion we saw on the TV news . Ammo does n't go up all at once - kind of like fireworks going off . Propane gas goes off in a big fireball . Gee , that 's kind of consistent with what the pictorial history shows . Hmmmmm ... : And if the government did start the fire , then why were n't people trying : to get out of the compound ? Remember , PRESSURIZED gas . People all over the building . Conflagration in less than a minute . Huge explosion . Gas masks being worn by the inhabitants . Makes a lot of sense that very few of those on the inside would even know that the tank was damaged . If they thought it was just a normal fire , they would probably be trying to put it out . Then - BOOM - the fireball . After that explosion and concussion , I doubt anybody on the inside of the building was capable of moving . : And besides ... oh , I do n't know why I 'm even bothering . Good question . Take an objective look at what happened , listen to the things that the FBI said ( `` The BD 's started the fire . '' `` The BD 's bodies were found with gunshot wounds . '' ) that are now being refuted by the evidence being recovered . Seems that the FBI is deliberately making statements that have no rational basis in fact , and trying to make them sound like fact . : I find it tremendously chilling that so many people seem eager to believe : a murderous , heavily-armed religious cult , despite much evidence to the : contrary . Thought Experiment : Suppose this exact same thing happened under : the Bush administration . What would your answer be then ? Would you still : prefer to believe the cultists ? Yes , I would still believe that the FBI and the BATF were on a non-stop string of lies and half-truths . This is consistent with their operations on numerous occasions . And as for the BD 's being murderous , they did not cause any problems until they were assaulted by the BATF . So now a thought experiment for you : If the BATF had never stormed that farm , would four agents and 90 BD 's be dead today ? : ( No , I do n't really expect a response to that challenge . ) : > But then : > again , that is how Mr. Clinton was elected , by people who believe that : > his campaign promisses would be respected by him once he got into office . : Um , is n't that how all politicians are elected ? Yes . That is how politicians are elected . Kind of scary , is n't it . Now if we as a people actually held Mr. Clinton to his promises instead of apologizing and denying that he ever made them , and actually expected accountability by our government , I doubt that debacles like Waco would happen as often as they do . : So is there any particular reason the gummint decided to slaughter eighty : people ? Are they , like , just plain evil , or what ? Did they just wake up : one day , stretch and yawn , and throw a dart at a map of the United States : to figure out who to oppress that day ? I 'm eager to know . Acutally , no . THe BATF has a rather checkered history of staging raids of this sort just prior to the time when their budget comes up for review . Oddly enough , their budget was about to be reviewed just two weeks after the initial raid on the BD 's . `` Coincidence ? I think not ! '' And as for the fire , what happened was caused by the act of knocking over walls with an armored vehicle of destruction . The FBI tried to convince the world it was suicide , but all of the facts that are coming out by the investigation of the Texas rangers and medical examiners point to a gas explosion and quick fire that decimated all of the occupants of the building . Sounds to me like a law enforcement agency that is trying to cover its ass . : And does Bill Clinton have cooler theme music than Darth Vader ? How is he : on diabolical laughter ?

More than Talk : From the FCC Rules : 73.4250 Subliminal Perception : ( a ) See Public Notice , FCC 74-78 , dated January 24 , 1974 , 44 FCC 2d , 1016 ; 39 Fr 3714 , January 29 , 1974 .

Since I do n't have either old copies of the Federal Register or the Information Bulletin around , I ca n't tell you what you ca n't do on TV ( or radio ) but I seem to remember this being an unnecisarily hot subject in the late '70s . Practically speaking , I dont have too much trouble seeing the one frame edits in MTV promos , badly scratched or torn single frames in films and such , but maby that 's just because the contrast between the single frame and the surrounding material was significant . I never believed in the one-frame type of SP being real . On the other hand , the Coca-Cola or Brand ( insert desired name here ) beer cans conveniently placed so the brand name is visible in the movie you just watched , that 's another story , and if your TV station or network was paid by the beer company for the privilege of doing that , there has to be a `` Promotional Consideration paid by ... ) or similar message included with the program ; but if the TV station bought the movie already edited that way from the film company and did n't get any of the payment for `` brand visibility '' that the film company got , then they do n't have to run the message . > > A few years ago , some junior person at an advertising agency > re-invented subliminal projection and one commercial went out on tape > with single-frame messages .

Original and older boards were bakelite composition , and were brown . Phenolic ( spelling ) was a tan Most `` non filled '' fiberglass boards used in computers are green . Filled fiberglass is blue . Teflon is white . As boards evolved more and more demands were made of them . First boards were used mainly in audio circuitry . Could n't be used in high voltage or RF because it would arc and burn . Most boards today are fiberglass , the type being chosen by its use and cost . Boards in satellite and microwave communication are teflon ( and ceramic ) as the fiberglass , and other boards are conductive ( they actually work more as a capacitive dialectric , but the word conductive simplifies explaination ) at the high frequencies . Another printed circuit material used mainly in automotive and interconnections is a thin flexible ( mostly mylar ) material and is used to connect the front of the vehicle ( etc ) to the back instead of wiring harnesses . Camcorders use this to intereconnect the boards inside where wires would be a nuisance .

I'm > trying to learn what I can about it . Any info would be appreciated . > Thanks . You 've asked a toughie of a question . There are many different drugs which are used for chemotherapy . The overall purpose of chemotherapy ( do n't worry about the spelling . Some of these crazy medical words are impossible to spell ! : - ) is to either destroy cancer cells or to keep them from growing . Different drugs have different effects on cancer cells , and therefore , it is not uncommon to use more than one drug at a time . Some chemotherapeutic drugs are effective anytime during the growth cycle of a cell . Others work only at specific times during the cell cycle . The first phase of the cell cycle is G1 ; it is when the protein synthesis and RNA systhesis occurs . In the second phase , S , synthesis of DNA occurs . The third phase is G2 ; The DNA splits and RNA and protein are synthesized aagain . In the fourth phase , M ( or Mitosis ) , the cell may divide . There are drugs which are effective in each phase . Some stop DNA synthesis . Others stop the cell from dividing . Others wreck protein synthesis . At any rate , the end result that is being sought is for the cancer cells to stop growing . If what you are seeking is `` practical '' advice , I apologize for rambling on the techno stuff . Some side effects are pretty common . Chemo . drugs are rather nasty . It can cause a person to lose their appetite and to experience nausea and vomiting . Things to help this include eating small frequent meals . It is also suggested that if nausea/vomiting ( hereafter known as n/v ) occurs that the person notify the doctor ; there are medicines tthat help nausea . Diarrhea can be an effect . Antidiarrheal medications can be given , and good skincare and fluid intake are important . Probably the one of biggest concsern is hair loss . This does not always happen . It depends on what drugs are being given , and on the person themself . Different people taking the same drug can and do have different side effects . I have seen some literature which states that wearing a snug headband and/or wearing an ice cap can help reduce hair loss , presumably by reducing blood flow to the scalp . If anyone has seen research on this too , I would love to see it , and possibly some bib data . I highly recommend making contact with the American Cancer Society . They have a vast selection of literature and information . In addition , if your friend has had a mastectomy , I highly recommend `` Reach for Recovery '' . It is a support group comprised entirely of women who have lost a breast because of cancer . They can offer some excellent support and suggestions . If you have further questions , please send me E-mail . I hav some good access to information , and I enjoy trying to help other people . I wish the best to you and your friend .

Israel 's # 1 issue is `` Security '' so *any* outcomes of `` negotiation '' certainly need to address ISREAL 'S perception of this issue . The problem is is defining ( by `` outsiders '' , by Israel , and by the Arabs themselves ) what is the # 1 issue to the Arab side . Is it `` Palestinian statehood '' , is it that Israel as a state should not and must not be allowed to exist , is it that the existence of a self-governing non- muslim `` state '' in the `` Islamic World '' is intolerable ... what ? Just as the dividing line between Israel-fighting-for-security and Israel-fighting- to-expand is often hard to discern by `` outsiders '' ( especially to the Arab world ) , so the rationale behind the Arab-struggle-to-undermine-Israel-in- any-way could either be based on visceral rejectionism or a sense of being wronged that still values peace , who knows which .

An `` Islamic Bank '' is something which operates in a different fashion to your modern bank , as I have explained here ( on another thread ) before . For example , Islamic banks do n't pay fixed interests on deposits , but a return on investments ( which varies according to the market , and is not fixed like interest is ) . Islamic banks are a relatively new phenomenon in the Islamic world . There are no Islamic banks in `` the West '' , including the USA , to my knowledge . I doubt if the market for them exists there -- at least not while `` Islamic banks '' are at a relatively early stage of their development as is the case now . BCCI is most certainly not an `` Islamic bank '' -- did BCCI ever pay a fixed interest rate on deposits ? If the answer to this question is `` yes '' , then BCCI was not an Islamic bank , as Islamic banks are specifically set up to _not_ pay or charge interest . Whether some Muslims partially owned the bank or whatever is completely irrelevant . Fred Rice darice @ yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au

Apparently you have some fundamental confusions about atheism ; I think many of these are well addressed in the famous FAQ . Your generalisms are then misplaced -- atheism need n't imply materialism , or the lack of an absolute moral system . However , I do tend to materialism and do n't believe in absolute morality , so I 'll answer your questions . > How then can an atheist judge value ? An atheist judges value in the same way that a theist does : according to a personal understanding of morality . That I do n't believe in an absolute one does n't mean that I do n't have one . I 'm just explicit , as in the line of postings you followed up , that when I express judgment on a moral issue I am basing my judgment on my own code rather than claiming that it is in some absolute sense good or bad . My moral code is not particular different from that of others around me , be they Christians , Muslims , or atheists . So when I say that I object to genocide , I 'm not expressing anything particularly out of line with what my society holds . If your were to ask why I think morality exists and has the form it does , my answer would be mechanistic to your taste -- that a moral code is a prerequisite for a functioning society , and that humanity probably evolved morality as we know it as part of the evolution of our ability to exist in large societies , thereby achieving considerable survival advantages . You 'd probably say that God just made the rules . Neither of us can convince the other , but we share a common understanding about many moral issues . You think you get it from your religion , I think I get it ( and you get it ) from early childhood teaching . > That you do n't like what God told people to do says nothing about God > or God 's commands , it says only that there was an electrical event in your > nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled > with a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction . I think you 've been reading the wrong sort of comic books , but in prying through the gobbledygook I basically agree with what you're saying . I do believe that my mental reactions to stimuli such as `` God commanded the genocide of the Canaanites '' is mechanistic , but of course I think that 's true of you as well . My reaction has little to do with whether God exists or even with whether I think he does , but if a god existed who commanded genocide , I could not consider him good , which is supposedly an attribute of God . > All of this being so , you have excluded > yourself from any discussion of values , right , wrong , goood , evil , > etc . and can not participate . Your opinion about the Bible can have no > weight whatsoever . Hmm . Yes , I think some heavy FAQ-reading would do you some good . I have as much place discussing values etc . as any other person . In fact , I can actually accomplish something in such a discussion , by framing the questions in terms of reason : for instance , it is clear that in an environment where neighboring tribes periodically attempt to wipe each other out based on imagined divine commands , then the quality of life will be generally poor , so a system that fosters coexistence is superior , if quality of life is an agreed goal . An absolutist , on the other hand , can only thump those portions of a Bible they happen to agree with , and say `` this is good '' , even if the act in question is unequivocally bad by the standards of everyone in the discussion . The attempt to define someone or a group of people as '' excluded from discussion '' , such that they `` can not participate '' , and their opinions given `` no weight whatsoever '' is the lowest form or reasoning ( ad hominem/poisoning the well ) , and presumably the resort of someone who ca n't rationally defend their own ideas of right , wrong , and the Bible . -- Jim Perry perry @ dsinc.com Decision Support , Inc. , Matthews NC These are my opinions .

From : hbloom @ moose.uvm.edu ( *Heather* ) Subject : re : earwax Organization : University of Vermont -- Division of EMBA Computer Facility Lines : 20 Hi Stephen Ear wax is a healthy way to help prevent ear infections , both by preventing a barrier and also with some antibiotic properties . Too much can block the external auditory canal ( the hole in the outside of the ear ) and cause some hearing problems . It is very simple , and safe , to remove excess wax on your own , or at your physician 's office . You can take a syringe ( no needles ! ) and fill it with 50 % warm water ( cold can cause fainting ) and 50 % OTC hydrogen peroxide . Then point the ear towards the ceiling ( about 45 degrees up ) and insert the tip of the syringe ( helps to have someone else do this ! ) and firmly expell the solution . Depending on the size of the syringe and the tenacity of the wax , this could take several rinses . If you place a bowl under the ear to catch the water , it will be much drier : - ) . You can buy a syringe with a special tip at your local pharmacy , or just use whatever you may have . If wax is old , it will be harder , and darker . You can try adding a few drops of olive oil into the ear during a shower to soften up the wax . Do this for a couple days , then try syringing again . It is also safe to point your ear up at the shower head , and allow the water to rinse it out . Good Luck -heather

Well , the best thing to do is to read the book `` Parallel Universes '' by Dr. Fred Wolf . In essence , Dr. Wolf says that one interpretation of the sub-atomic particle/wave duality is that what we perceive as a wave is actually an infinate number of parallel universes overlaid , and in each of these universes there is a particle in a different location . When we do something to make a particle `` appear , '' we are actually causing all the parallel universes to collapse into one . Apparently this is one line of thought on the nature of QM , that is going through some of the scientific community . Dr. Wolf ( and many others ) claim that somehow the collapse is caused by the mental effort of observing the particle . This implys that mind is more than merely a biological phenomenon . He then extrapolates that if mind is an integral part of the universe , then perhaps consciousness is the element that gives order and form to the universe ( s ) it/themself ( s ) . It all gets rather interesting , but what I find facinating is that this would explain the phenomenon of `` magick '' as practiced in my religion . Dr. Wolf speculates that the ordering functionality of mind could be caused by the selection of a future from an infinite number of possible futures ; he says that this might be done by some sort of communication between ones current , and possible future selves . I have long speculated that if magick is not merely a form of self delusion then perhaps it could be caused by some sort of a selection of one of many possible futures . I realize that this gets pretty bizarre , but it never hurts to keep an open mind and at least file it all away as another possibile explaination of the world in which we find ourselves . After all , the more we learn about the universe in which we live , the more we learn that it is truly a very strange place . > Nanci eric

If that is true , the kind monitor would not make any difference becuase everything on the screen can be picked-up from the video controller . Can anybody verify or refute this ? Yes , that 's true . TEMPEST is nothing magic , it 's just listening to any available electromagnetic emissions and using all the analysis techniques you know to separate out the interesting stuff . The nice thing about old CRTs is that they used to put out LOTS of signal , so they 're easy to detect , and if you do your sync carefully , you can watch the output on the monitor in your deceptively-marked Chevy Step-Van . Some brands of electric typewriters were even worse . In both cases , it 's especially nice because it gets you the data the user is looking at , rather than whatever stuff the paging algorithm is paging out to disk , etc . With newer , quieter equipment , there is n't as much signal , and it 's harder to isolate the fun parts . TEMPEST-rated equipment has much lower signal levels .

Think ! It 's the SCSI card doing the DMA transfers NOT the disks ... The SCSI card can do DMA transfers containing data from any of the SCSI devices it is attached when it wants to . An important feature of SCSI is the ability to detach a device . This frees the SCSI bus for other devices . This is typically used in a multi-tasking OS to start transfers on several devices . While each device is seeking the data the bus is free for other commands and data transfers . When the devices are ready to transfer the data they can aquire the bus and send the data . On an IDE bus when you start a transfer the bus is busy until the disk has seeked the data and transfered it . This is typically a 10-20ms second lock out for other processes wanting the bus irrespective of transfer time . > > Also , I 'm still trying to track down a copy of IBM 's AT reference book , > but from their PC technical manual ( page 2-93 ) : > > `` The ( FDD ) adapter is buffered on the I.O bus and uses the System Board > direct memory access ( DMA ) for record data transfers .

From : guykuo @ carson.u.washington.edu ( Guy Kuo ) Subject : Quadra Clock Modification - Long Summary : Quadra 700 Clock Acceleration Instructions Keywords : Quadra , clock , acceleration , oscillator Article-I.D . : shelley.1r577lINNjks Organization : University of Washington Lines : 149 NNTP-Posting-Host : carson.u.washington.edu Here is how I modified my Quadra 700 for higher speed . Previously I had been using a Variable Speed Overdrive for accelerating my CPU but this modification is testing out as more stable at higher speeds . Your mileage may vary . The top speed you achieve can not be predicted before hand . My personal Q700 has tested fine up to 32 mhz thus far . I did n't have higher speed clock oscillators on hand to test higher speeds . Parts Clock Oscillators ( 4 pin TTL variety ) You will need a selection of speeds beginning at 50 mhz on up . The CPU will run at 1/2 the oscillator speed . The original one is a 50 mhz unit . I recommend getting a 50 mhz clock in case you damage the existing one . I obtained my clock oscillators from DigiKey 1-800-344-4539 for less than $ 5.00 each . Some of their part numbers are : 50 mhz TTL Clock Oscillator ( part # X121 ) 62 mhz TTL Clock Oscillator ( part # X136 ) 66 mhz TTL Clock Oscillator ( part # CTX137 ) Do n't get the half size clock oscillators . They wo n't fit . There are also CMOS clock oscillators . I have n't tried one in a Quadra . ( They work fine in IIsi 's ) Socket : Obtain a 4 pin socket which is in the same form factor as a 14 pin DIP package . Alternatively , use 4 machined socket pins from an Augat style socket . Just cut them out of the socket . Cooling Fan : A very small 12 volt fan to keep the CPU cool is a must . My VSO came with a specially modified heatsink which had a fan built onto it . It had a pass-through connector which tapped into the hard drive power cable . You should rig up something similar or risk frying your CPU . Procedure 1 ) Insert usual disclaimer and antistatic warnings here . 2 ) Remove the top lid of the machine . You will see the floppy disk and hard drive mounted in a plastic tower . Follow the usual anti-static precautions and of course make sure the machine is OFF when you do this . Unplug ALL cables , wall and monitor power supply cords from the back of the mac . 3 ) Remove the power supply by pulling the plastic interlocking tab on the tower forward and simultaneously pulling the power supply straight up . The tab is a piece of plastic from the left posterior aspect of the tower which extends downward to hook on to the power supply . You may also feel a horseshoe shaped piece at the right portion of the power supply . Leave that alone . The plastic tab from the tower is all you need release . 4 ) Look at the rear of the tower assembly . You will see the flat ribbon SCSI connector to the hard drive , a power cable and a flat ribbon cable leading to the floppy drive . Disconnect all these from the motherboard . The hard drive power cable connector has a tab which must be squeezed to release it . 5 ) Unplug the drive activity LED from its clear plastic mount 6 ) Look down the posterior , cylindrical section of the plastic tower . A phillips head screw is at the base . Remove it , taking care not to drop it into the case . A bit of gummy glue on your screwdriver is helpful here . 7 ) Remove the tower assembly by pulling medially the plastic tab on the right side of the tower . This tab prevents the tower from sliding posteriorly . Slide the entire tower assembly 1 cm posteriorly then lift the tower assembly straight up and out of the case . 8 ) Remove the interrupt switch assembly . It is a strangely shaped plastic device at the left , front edge of the motherboard . Pull the middle , rear plastic prong up and forward . The entire device will release . 9 ) Unplug the speaker cable . Squeeze the plastic tab on the speaker to free it then swing it backwards to free it from the case . 10 ) Remove the motherboard form the case . Lift the front right corner of the motherboard about 1 mm . This allows it to clear the clear plastic Power light guide . Slide the motherboard forward about 1 cm . The motherboard then comes directly out . 11 ) Locate the 50 mhz clock crystal . It is a small metal box near the CPU chip . Note and remember its orientation . The new clock oscillators must be aligned with pin 1 in the same orientation . Very carefully desolder and remove the old clock oscillator . Some of the pins may be bent over . Simply desolder then unbend them . Be sure your desoldering iron is hot enough before heating the board . I used a suction desoldering iron to accomplish this task . This is NOT appropriate for a first soldering experience . The motherboard is a multi-layer design with very fine traces - easily damaged without proper care . 12 ) Install your socket or socket pins where the old oscillator once was . 13 ) Put a 50 mhz clock oscillator into the new socket . You could use the old clock but it has solder on its pins . This may come of inside the socket and cause corrosion problems later . I suggest using a new 50 mhz clock . 14 ) Install your cooling fan system to complete the modification . 14 ) Reinsert the motherboard and slide it into place . 15 ) Snap in the interrupt switch assembly and speaker to lock the mother board firmly . Plug the speaker wire back into the motherboard . 16 ) Reinstall the tower assembly by first placing the right wall of the tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembly about 1 cm posterior of its intended position . Lower the tower assembly into place while maintaining contact with the right wall of the case . Once fully down , slide the tower assembly anteriorly until it clicks into place . 17 ) Reconnect the motherboard ends of the cables . DONT'T FORGET THE FLOPPY DRIVE CABLE . 18 ) Replace the phillips head screw 19 ) Drop the power supply straight down into place until it clicks in . 20 ) Plug the hard drive activity light back into its clear plastic mount . 21 ) Reattach your cables and power cords . Cross your fingers and turn on the Mac . It should make the usual power on chord . If it does n't , something is amiss . Immediately turn of the power and recheck your handiwork . If all is not well , you have my sincere condolences . Hopefully , all will work normally . Turn the machine back off and replace the 50 mhz clock oscillator with a faster one . Reboot and be astounded . You will need to fully test the machine for many hours before deciding a particular speed is truly usable . With my VSO , a machine lock-up might take 8 hours of operation to occur . In the brief time since modifying my clock oscillator ( 36 hours ) I have not had a single problem . Good Luck to all who attempt this modification . There is a small but real risk , but you could well reach Quadra 950 speeds or higher with less than $ 50 in parts .

Unfortunately , doctors prescribe drugs to treat the side effects of the drugs a patient is receiving . If one drug they are taking causes the patient 's blood pressure to go up , many times an antihypertensive is prescribed instead of re-evaluating the need for the original drug . This is why many older adults are trying to take a dozen or so drugs at home ! ! ! ! > ... .procure a list of the drugs your grandmother is getting , and discuss > it with an independent doc .

I fully agree . In addition , she proably should be examined by another doctor who can re-evaluate the need for the medications she is taking . I ca n't remember the guidelines I either saw in a text or heard during a lecture , but any elderly adult who is receiving medications should have the need for the drug re-evaluated regularly . If her current physician is unwilling to do this , find one who will . Either check the phone book for a physician who specializes in geriatric medicine or gerontology , or contact a physician referral line or the American Medical Society . By finding a geriatric specialist , he ( she ) will more likely be in tune with the special needs of elderly adults and maybe can help .

I think they are correct in thinking that a well-placed bomb or six would get headlines , but I think they are wrong if they think that you can set off bombs and still be a Buddhist .

Yes they are , and whether this serves them well or not depends on whether they want Buddhist principles or political independence .

Better off in what way ? As proponents of pacifism or as proponents of political autonomy ? And better off in what time-scale ? The Soviet Empire practised cultural genocide against something like a hundred small minorities , some of which resisted violently , and some of which did not , but in the end it was the Soviet Empire that collapsed and at least some of the minorities survived . Now some of the minorities are fighting one another . Is that because they have to , or because violent resistance to an oppressive Empire legitimized violence ? jon .

Since neither side would be particularly interested in telling the truth , you have to weigh the 'facts ' given by each yourself , and weigh it with the newsreporting if you care . Many cult members will probably side with the attorney , and if he is lying , change their stories to match his . And if the Feds also lie , the cult members who become disillusioned will change their stories to match the Feds . Neither sides are interested in the truth . The Media is more interested , but usually either do n't have the time to get it straight or tie themselves to the ratings and deliberately distort . For me , though , the black soot billowing outside the compound added with how fast the fire spread ponted to *someone* dousing large parts of the compound with some sort of gasoline or fire-starter . I doubt the Feds did that as they were more interested in arresting Vernon . The real unbalanced one ( at least the one that lost his cool ) was Vernon , so I figured that he was more likely to do it ( after all he was Jesus being persecuted by the authorities , and had followers to hold onto , so made the decision . He and his followers also probably felt that they were rocketing to heaven by doing this stuff ) . Thsi conclusion , I came to after umpteen million hours of listening to NPR and other radio shows ( I always have the radio going when I am in my office on some innocuous talk-show or news program as background noise ) . -- < > < > < > < > < > < > < > < > < > < > Personal opinions ?

It was originally designed to service 40 active users , and up to 70 moderately active users . This is NOT a PC ! It was designed to be a Unix box from the start , and it's very fast and exceptionally reliable . It 's dimensions are approximately 2.5 ' high ( tower ) , 8 '' wide and 2 '' deep . I am only interested in dealing with someone local enough to come pick it up . Shipping is way too much hassle . Call if you wish , or send email .
