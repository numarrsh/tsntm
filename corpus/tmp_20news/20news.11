In a cell church , the fundamental building block is the `` cell group '' -- a small group of no more than 15 believers . The small groups are responsible for the ministry of the church : evangelism and discipleship .

From : koontzd @ phobos.lrmsc.loral.com ( David Koontz ) Subject : Will FEDs troll for mutilated law enforcement blocks ? Originator : koontzd @ phobos Organization : Loral Rolm Computer Systems Lines : 121 From Denning : the Skipjack encryption algorithm F , an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips N , a 30-bit serial number U , an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip E [ M ; K ] , the encrypted message stream , and E [ E [ K ; U ] + N ; F ] , a law enforcement block . Where the session key is K , and is transmitted encrypted in the unit Key U . Which along with the serial number N is encrypted in the Family key F. Presumably the protocol can be recovered ( if by nothing else , differential analysis ) . Postulate if you will , a chip ( or logic ) sitting between the clipper chip and its communications channel . The function of this spoof chip is twofold : 1 ) Transmit Channel The spoof chip XORs the 30 bit encrypted serial number with a secondary keying variable . This renders the serial number unrecoverable with just the family key 2 ) Receive Channel The spoof chip XORs the incoming encrypted serial number with a secondary keying variable ( assuming integrity of the law enforcement block is necessary for local operation - checksums , sequence control , etc. ) . This has the net result of hiding the serial number . It is probable theere is a known plaintext pattern used as a filler in the block containing N ( 34 bits as used in generating U , U1 , U2 ) correctness of the law enforcement block can be determined with only the family key F. Whereas , no one has proposed Federal Agencies be denied F , and because they could recover it themselves , The correctness of the serial number can be tested by examining the pad bits of N in E [ N ; F ] . The one could selectively alter the law enforcement block as above , but the mutilation could be detected . A better approach would be to mutilate the entire law enforcement block . If it were done with a group encryption scheme such as DES or ( presumably ) Skipjack , the chances the law enforcement block can be recovered are lessened . What do you want to bet the transmission protocol can be recognized and the serial numbers decrypted in a target search ? When digital transmission becomes widely available , would there be a requirement that clipper protocol transmissions be refused when containing mutilated law enforcement blocks ? One way to avoid notice , would be to spoof protocol information of the block containing M , as well as spoofing the law enforcement block . The goal is to use a secure communications scheme , without redress to detection or key K interception ( contained encrypted within the law enforcement block ) . The data stream is returned to its original state for use by the clipper chip ( or system ) if required , for proper operation . It is somewhat improbable that the entire protocol will be contained within the clipper chip , yet likely that sequence of events will be tested for , requiring a valid law enforcement block to be received before accepting and decrypting E ( M ; K ) ; The spoof chip could be implemented anywhere in the protocols , including on the resulting serial data stream . Existing clipper products could be subborned . After all , they are high security encryption systems right ? Super encipherment/encryption could allow the chip to be used without redress to detection of the use of the chip , or disclosure of the serial number . Security must be adequate to deny the serial number , which should not be recoverable by other means . One can see the use of cut outs for procurring clipper phones , or once the number of units is high enough , stealing them . It would be a mistake on the part of authority , but nice from a point of privacy , if the serial number N were not associated with a particular clipper chip or lot of chips through the manufacturing and distribution process . Hopefully the list of known missing or stolen clipper serial numbers N encrypted with F , and the protocols are not sufficient plaintext to attact the super encrypted clipper stream . This could be further made difficult by altering the temporal and or spatial relationship of the clipper stream to that of the super encrypted stream . Detection of an encrypted stream could tip off the use of the aforementioned scheme . ****************************************************************************** If you could capture valid law enforcement blocks not your own , and use them in a codebook sustitution with your own , where they point to a valid law enforcement block stored in a library utilizing a session key matching the remainder of the transmission , you could simply out and out lie , yet deliver to monitoring and/or hostile forces a seemingly valid law enforcement block . These captured law enforcement blocks would be used as authenticators , such as in a manually keyed encryption system . Fending this off would require escalation in examining the protocols and blocks in the transmission . The M code stream might be independently attacked based on knowledge of clipper chip protocols as revealed plaintext . This could be invalidated by changing the temporal and or spatial relationship of the clipper M stream and the actual transmitted stream , under the control of a secure key generator synchronized between endpoints . The useful life time of captured law enforcement blocks might be limited based on hostile forces using them as targets following transmission interception . You would need a large number of them , but , hey there's supposed to be millions of these things , right ? Adding time stamps to the encrypted law enforcement block is probably impractical , who wants an encryption chip with a real time clock ? ***************************************************************************** The entire idea of the law enforcement block can be invalidated .

Well , > maybe they can get chips running at one trial per nanosecond , and build > a machine with 10 million chips . Sure -- only 3.8 years for each solution . But there is a MUCH more pernicious problem with the scheme as proposed . Building a brute force machine to test 2^40 possible keys if you have the other half from one escrow agent is EASY . ( One chip , one test per microsecond gives you one break every two weeks , and that break gives you all messages involving that phone . ) The XOR scheme so that the files from one escrow agent gives you nothing is an improvement , but notice that XORing with ( truely random ) bit strings allows for an arbitrary number of escrow agents . Using + for XOR , SK for the escrowed key , and A and B for two random bit strings , hand SK+A+B , SK+A , and SK+B to three escrow agents . It is possible to come with an encoding scheme to match any escrow pattern , for example 3 of 4 , such that fewer cooperating escrow agents gives the cracking agency no benefit . -- Robert I.

Rarely are any widespread social phenomenon reducible to such a simple premise . If they were , psychology would be a hard science with roughly the same mathematical soundness as physics . Your premise may well be right . It is much more likely , however , that it reflects your socialization and religious background , as well as your need to validate your religious beliefs . Were I to pretend to have all the answers ( and I do n't ) , I would say that the xenophobia , guilt , and intolerance brought about by adherence to fundamentalist religions play just as large a role in depressing the members of our society .

From : dwatson @ cser.encore.com ( Drew Watson ) Subject : Ethics vs. Freedom Organization : Encore Computer Corporation Lines : 70 Being a parent in need of some help , I ask that you bear with me while I describe the situation which plagues me ... I am a divorced father . Chance would have it that `` my weekend '' with my daughter has fallen upon Easter Weekend this year . Although I am Presbyterian , I had married a Catholic woman . We decided that the Catholic moray of indoctrination of the spouse into the faith was too confining ( and restrictive due to time as we had already set a date ) , and we were married in a Christian Church which was non-denominational . During the years of our marriage , we did not often attend church . When our daughter was born , some years later , my wife insisted that she be baptised as Catholic . This was n't a problem with me . During a separation of five years , my ex-wife was taken ill with a disease that affected her mental capacities . She was confined to a mental ward for two months before it was diagnosed . It has since been treated `` effectively '' . In other words , professionals have deemed her a functioning member of society . During the recuperation , my ex-wife has embraced Buddism . Her influence over my daughter has been substantial , and has primarily allowed me only Saturday visitation for a number of years . During this period I have read Bible study books to my daughter , and tried to keep her aware of her Christian heritage . Last fall , our divorce was finalized after a year of viscious divorce hearings . At that time I was awarded visitation rights every other weekend . At that time , I started taking my daughter to church quite often , although not every weekend . I did this to attempt to strengthen the Christian ethic and expose her to a religious community . Today , Easter Sunday , I took my daughter to church . When it came time for Communion , my daughter took the bread ( The body of Christ ) but left the wine ( The blood of Christ ) professing that she was too young for wine . She then balled the bread up in her hand and tried to descretely throw it under the pew in front of us . I feel this was a slap in the face to me , my religion , and an afront to her religious heritage . It can be construed as breaking several of the commandments if you try . I really felt dishonored by the action . My daughter is only nine years old , but I think she should have been old and mature enough to realize her actions . I have difficulty blaming her directly for religious teachings her mother swears to , but when I discussed this with my daughter she made it clear she believed in Buddhism and not Christianity . My initial response of anger ( moderated ) was to suggest if there is no faith in Christ then why does she celebrate Easter , or Christmas ? I suggested I would never force her to practice my religious beliefs by celebrating holidays with her again . I do not want to `` drive her from the fold '' , and would be willing to allow her to continue practicing Buddhism ( as though I had a choice seeing her only for two days out of fourteen ) but I want her to want to embrace Christianity . Any suggestions ? If you have a response , please e-mail me a copy . ( I 'm not a regular reader of this newsgroup . ) ( Naturally , feel free to post too ! ) Thanks , and I hope you 've had a happy Easter .

Pretty clearly , Alomar got a HUGE boost from his home park . Not necessarily . It could mean that , or it could mean that he just hit a lot better at home than he did on the road ( see Frank Thomas ' home/road splits in '91 for an example ) . I would guess that some of Alomar 's split is due to the Skydome , but most of it is probably due just to coincidence . There 's no way to be sure , of course , but the only hitters the Skydome seems to regularly help a lot are right handed home run hitters , and Alomar is not a home run hitter . > I 'd say you could make a good for them being about equal right now . T & P > rated Baerga higher , actually . Only because of t & P 's bogus fielding stats , which rate Alomar as the worst defensive second baseman in the league . On a career basis , I think T & P's fielding stats may mean something , but on a seasonal basis it comes up with ridiculous results like this . Alomar may not be the god of fielding the media says he is , but he sure is n't the worst in baseball . Offensively , T & P rate Alomar much higher last year .

First of all , the village housed many *armed* troops . Secondly , the Irgun and Stern fighters had absolutely no intentions of killing civilians . The village was attacked only for its military significance . In fact , a warning was given to the occupants of the village to leave before the attack was to begin . By all rational standards , Dir Yassin was not a massacre . The killing was unintentional . The village housed Arab snipers and Arab troops . Thus it was attacked for its military significance . It was not attacked with intentions of killing any civilians . To even compare Dir Yassin , in which some 120 or so Arabs died , to the Holocaust is absurd . The Irgun did not want to kill any civilians . The village had almost 1000 inhabitants , most of whom survived . Harry .

I would prefer more training with > a `` traditional '' semi-auto ( ala Colt .45 ) but of course that 's just my opinion . > > Jason At the risk of starting the 'my gun is better than yours ' flame war , I must disagree . There is no secret in handling a Glock . In fact , it is often chosen ( besides its other merits ) because it shoots like a revolver does basically . It can limit the training time ( read budget $ $ $ ) due to the fact there are no 'external ' safties other than the trigger , hence less training time required . Smith & Wesson ( among other types ) are chosen due to the fact taht they do have the external safties ( hammer drop , as well as mag drop ) which if properly used have saved many lives when 'Mr . Bad ' snatched the gun from the officer and tried to shoot said officer the gun was on safe and would not fire . This point had been made in many articles in various gun magazines . If fact , one author ( ca n't remember who ) staged a little test where he had a revolver and a S & W on safe laying on a table and asked people with little firearms experience to on his signal , grab the gun and shoot a target . He timed the people using each gun . The revolver times were pretty close , but some of the times with the S & W were in minutes , or the person just gave up because they could not figure out the saftey . You do n't often see Colt 45 autos issued due to the light trigger which can be accidentally fired in a stress situation , opening the issuing city , county , etc.. to lawsuits , bad press , etc.. Of course any problem can be overcome with enough training , but such training is not always available to budget crunched departments . I know if I were a Cop I would want something like a S & W just for the off chance of the gun getting taken away . The safety does n't guarantee that 'Mr . Bad ' wo n't figure it out and shoot me , but it could buy enough time to draw a second gun and shoot 'Mr . Bad ' before it 's too late . Do n't think I am too biassed here just because I have had 3 Glocks in my possession at one time , because I have had a .45 as well . In fact , it was my first handgun . Remember , the ultimate 'safety ' is YOU the operator , and no safety is going to stop an negligent discharge ( note I do n't say accidental ) if you break the rules of gun handling .

First somebody was accusing him of being self-righteous and unconvincing . Now we are told that we Christians should be embarrassed by him . ( As well as by Josh McDowell , about whom I have no comment , having never read his work . ) Anyone who thinks that C. S. Lewis was self-righteous ought to read his introduction to The Problem of Pain , which is his theodicy . In it , he explains that he wanted to publish the book anonymously . Why ? Although he believed in the argument he was presenting , he did not want to seem to presume to tell others how brave they should be in the face of their own suffering . He did not want people to think that he was presenting himself as some kind of model of fortitude , or that he was anything other than what he considered himself to be -- `` a great coward . '' OFM has adequately handled the question of whether we ought to be embarrassed by Lewis ' liar/lunatic/lord argument ( which , by the way , is part of a *much* bigger discourse . ) I would just like to add that , far from being embarrassed by Lewis , I am in a state of continual amazement at the soundness and clarity of the arguments he presents . - Phil - Hey , we 're talking about the PHONE COMPANY , here .

When we watch the status ( Graph . Proc . Status ) , we always get the value 0FH instead of 0H . Full would mean 0FFH ( 8 places occupied ) , empty would mean 0H ( 0 places occupied ) .

Too bad it's so demonstrably false . Take a look at Great Britain sometime for a nice history on drug criminalization . The evidence there shows that during periods of time when drugs ( such as heroin ) were illegal , crime went up and people did die from bad drugs . During times when drugs were legalized , those trends were reversed . > > If you would like to prove how clueless you are , we can get into > why - again a lot of wasted posts that I do n't think this group > was intended for and something easily solved by you doing a little > research . Now this is a great example of an ironclad proof . Gosh , I 'm convinced . ( : - } for the humor impaired ) . First , assert something for which you have no evidence , then dodge requests for proof by claiming to know what this group was intended for . As to research , if you 'd done any at all , you 'd realize that there is plenty of reason to believe that legalizing drugs will have many benefits to society . There are some plausible arguments against it , too , but they are n't enough to convince me that criminalization of drugs is the answer .

I just wanted to share with you a bit of my > experience of living 30 years under a totalitarian regime ( I'm > Bulgarian ) - because I thought that it might be useful to you . Oh > well . I think your experiences under the Bulgarian regime are highly relevant . We have too many people with their heads in the sand saying it can not happen here , as our Constitutional Rights are being trashed every day because the government justifies doing some end-run around the protections by a 'crisis ' requiring 'drastic action ' . It is most likely that in the future possession of secure encryption tools will be regarded as possession of 'terrorist and drug dealers tools ' , and be some serious Fedaral Felony . Just like common tools are 'burgular tools ' if the police say so , common computer programs ( even computers themselves ) are now 'hackers tools ' , and will become 'terrorist tools ' . BET ON IT . The insights of someone who has lived throught this are very important . If the US goes the way of the old Soviet Union and its client states as far as individual rights , privacy and overall freedom are concerned , the rest of the world ( remember 'New World Order ' ? ) will not be far behind - only a few years . Please keep posting anything you find that is deficient or that threatens ones rights in this thing . For example , a conversation between a suspect and a lawyer will no longer be private from Big Brother eavesdropping . Political dissent allready is very dangerous in this country , all it takes is the government to decide that enough people will take one seriously , then one becomes guilty of 'plotting to overthrow the government by illegal means ' . The phrase 'illegal means ' is defined as whatever the government wants it to be defined as . Couple this with Clinton 's pressing for a 'smart ' National ID card ( an 'Internal passport ' ? ) , with the added wrinkle that anything about you and your past can be put on it , and you can only take the government's word as to what is really on it ( since they will be the only ones with the means to completely read and reprogram the thing ) . Isn't that nice ? While the Feds can bust into one 's safe without the keys , the owner knows his safe has been broken into . When they break into your 'secure' phone conversations ( or other stored/transmitted data in the near future ) you have no way of knowing , so accountability as to the legalities has gone out the window . Just like a safe , if they have a legal cause , they can get the keys from the suspect , just like they can get the keys to a safe or the combination from the suspect . Same with encryption : Record everything , get the warrants , THEN decode it with the keys obtained from the suspect . This Clinton Cripple , along with its natural extensions , will make any priviliged communications between client and lawyer , and any meaningful political dissent virtually impossible . Which is the general idea . Any propeganda about its being secure , and the safeguards , and all of that are just that - propeganda to reassure people so they will by into this monstrosity .

From : ebrahim @ ee.umanitoba.ca ( Mohamad Ebrahimi ) Subject : PBS Frontline : Iran and the bomb Nntp-Posting-Host : ic17.ee.umanitoba.ca Organization : Elect & Comp Engineering , U of Manitoba , Winnipeg , Manitoba , Canada Lines : 75 I would like to share with netters a few points I picked up from the PBS Frontline program regarding Iran 's nuclear activities , aired on Tuesday April 13 . For the sake of brevity , I 'll present them in some separate points . 1- As many other western programs , this program was laid on a bed of misinformation throughout the program , to maximize the effect of the program on the viewer . Some of the misinformations were as follows : - It was alleged that : '' Late Imam Khomeini objected to Shah 's technological advancements as anti-Islamic , but now things have changed and the proof of change is that some Iranian merchants are now selling personal computers . `` ! These are the most ridiculous lies , one can make about the objectives of the Islamic Revolution in toppling the Shah and state of the technology in Iran after revolution . -Iran was equally accused of using chemical weapons against Iraqi aggressors while there has never been any proof in this regard , and nobody has seen Iraqi soldiers or civilians injured by Iranian chemical weapons , in contrary to what the whole world has seen about Iranian soldiers and civilians , injured by Iraqi chemical weapons . - While the number of martyrs during the sacred defense against Iraqi aggression has been officially announced to be about 117,000 and even most radical counter-revolutionary groups claim that Iran and Iraq had a total of one million dead , this program claims that Iran alone has one million dead left from the war . - The translation of Iranian officials ' talks are not 100 % true . For example when Iranian head of Atomic Energy says that : `` It hurts me to see that Iran is the subject of these unfriendly propaganda . '' The translator says : `` It hurts to see that Iran is doing unfriendly research. '' ! 2- Almost all alleged devices or material bought or planned to be bought by Iranians were of countless dual usage , while the program tries to undermine their non-military uses , without any reference to Iran's big population and its inevitable need to other sources of energy in near future and its current deficit in electrical power . 3- The whole program is trying to show the Sharif University of Technology as a nuclear research center , while even the cameramen of the program know well that in a country like Iran without a so tightly closed society no one can make a nuclear bomb in a university ! Taking in account the scientific advancement of Sharif U. in engineering fields and its potential role in improvement of Iran 's industries and eventually the lives of people , it is obvious that they are persuading other countries to prevent them from further helping this university or other ones in scientific and industrial efforts . 4- A key point in program 's justifications is trying to disvalidate as much as possible all efforts done by IAEA [ * ] in their numerous visits from Iran 's different sites . They say : `` We are not sure if the places visited by IAEA are the real ones or not '' ! , or `` We can not rely on IAEA's reports and observation , because they failed to see Iraq 's nuclear activities before '' as if they did n't know that Iraq was trying to build nuclear weapons ! 5- As an extremely personal opinion , the most disgusting aspect of the program was the arrogance of the member of US Senate foreign Affairs , William Triplet , in his way of talking , as if he was the god talking from the absolute knowledge ! I hope all Iranians be aware of the gradual buildup against their country in western media , and I hope Iranian authorities continue to their wise and calculated approach with regard to international affairs and peaceful coexistence with friendly nations .

My experience has | > been that reducing dealer profit does not necessarily save me money . | > | > Fred Say , you bought your Saturn at $ 13k , with a dealer profit of $ 2k . If the dealer profit is $ 1000 , then you would only be paying $ 12k for the same car . So is n't that saving money ? Moreover , if Saturn really does reduce the dealer profit margin by $ 1000 , then their cars will be even better deals . Say , if the price of a Saturn was already $ 1000 below market average for the class of cars , then after they reduce the dealer profit , it would be $ 2000 below market average . It will : 1 ) Attract even more people to buy Saturns because it would SAVE THEM MONEY . 2 ) Force the competitors to lower their prices to survive . Now , not only will Saturn owners benefit from a lower dealer profit , even the buyers for other cars will pay less . Is n't that saving money ? $ 0.02 , doug .

Jagr did not have a better season than Francis ... to suggest otherwise is an insult to those with a modicum of hockey knowledge . Save your almost maniacal devotion to the almighty plus/minus ... it is the most misleading hockey stat available . Until the NHL publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic including ice time per game and some measure of its `` quality '' ( i.e. , is the player put out in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game ; is he matched up against the other team 's top one or two lines ; short-handed , etc ) , I would much rather see the +/- disappear altogether instead of having its dubious merits trumpeted by those with little understanding of its implications .

With all of God 's power He certainly can do whatever He wants when He wants it . The Bible `` ends '' with the book of Revelations . But does God 's reign end there ? No . So who can say for sure that God 's messages are either no longer happening or still happening ? I can now hear the clamor for proof . 8- ) With the cold response I 've gotten from the past from this group , it 's very hard to get the point across . I 'll only go over the physical stuff so that skeptics can look at documents stored somewhere . I 've cited the uncorrupted bodies of saints before . They 're still there . 8- ) The apparitions at Fatima , Portugal culminated in a miracle specifically granted to show God 's existence . That was the spinning/descending of the sun . It was seen in several countries . That event is `` approved '' by the Pope . Currently , images of Mary in Japan , Korea , Yugoslavia , Philippines , Africa are showing tears ( natural or blood ) . These are still under investigation by the Church . But realize that investigations take decades to finish . And if the message is Christ will come in ten days , that 's a bit too late , is n't it 8- ) . Other events under investigation are inner locutions ( `` coming to know '' ) , stigmata ( the person exhibits Christ 's wounds . And they do n't heal . And doctor 's do n't know why ) . Non-believers are welcome to pore through documents , I 'm sure . This stuff is not like Koresh . Or Oral Roberts ( give me $ 5M or God will call me home ) . It 's free . Find out why they're happening ( as we ourselves are studying why ) . If anybody can figure this out , tell us ! You can be of any religion . If you have the resources , go to one of the countries I mentioned . These are not `` members only '' events . God and Mary invites everybody . So in conclusion ( finally ) ... We RC 's believe in the modern day manifestations of God and Mary . We are scared to death sometimes although we 're told not to . There are more proofs and events . And that is why `` not everything is in the Bible '' . Although in a lot of the apparitions , we are told to read the Bible . As far as the Protestant vs. Catholics issue is concerned ... In the end , God 's churches will unite . I 'm not sure how . I have some idea . But the point is we should n't worry about the `` versus '' part . Just do God 's work . That 's all that matters . Unity will come . BTW , I 'm just a plain person . I 'm not the Pope 's spokesperson .

Wishy- > washy statements are not scientific . Note that `` ( the celestial bodies ) '' in the above verse is an interpolation ( which is why it is in brackets ) -- it is the translator 's ( incorrect , IMHO ) interpretation . Here is Maurice Bucaille 's translation ( he studied Arabic for his research into the Qur'an and science ) of this verse : '' ( God is ) the One Who created the night , the day , the sun and the moon . Each is travelling in an orbit with its own motion . '' ( Qur'an :33 ) The positive aspect of this verse noted by Dr. Maurice Bucaille is that while geocentrism was the commonly accepted notion at the time ( and for a long time afterwards ) , there is no notion of geocentrism in this verse ( or anywhere in the Qur'an ) .

I have to consult my city and inform them that it 's from now a fishing village .

Lines : 62 I may not be the world 's greatest expert on chiggers ( a type of mite indigenous to the south ) , but I certainly have spent a lot of time contemplating the little buggers over the past six years ( since we moved to N.C. ) . Here are some observations gained from painful experience : 1 . Reactions to chiggers vary greatly from person to person . Some people get tiny red bites . Others ( like me ) are more sensitive and get fairly large swollen sore-like affairs . 2 . Chigger bites are the gift that keeps on giving . I swear that these things will itch for months . 3 . There is a lot of folklore about chiggers . I think most of it is fiction . I have tried to do research on the critters , since they have such an effect on me . The only book I could find on the subject was a *single* book in UNC 's special collections library . I have not yet gone through what is required to get it . 4 . Based on my experience and that of my family members , the old folk remedy of fingernail polish simply does n't work . I recall reading that the theory upon which it is based ( that the chiggers burrow into your skin and continue to party there ) is false . I think it is more likely that the reaction is to toxins of some sort the little pests release . But this is speculation . 5 . The *best* approach is prevention . A couple of things work well . A good insect repellent ( DEET ) such as Deep Woods Off liberally applied to ankles , waistband , etc . is a good start . There is another preparation called `` Chig Away '' that is a combination of sulfur and some kind of cream ( cortisone ? ) that originally was prepared for the Army and is not commercially available . In the summer I put this on my ankles every morning when I get up on weekends since I literally ca n't go outside where we live ( in the country ) without serious consequences . ( They apparently do n't like sulfur much at all . You can use sulfur as a dust on your body or clothing to repel them . ) 6 . No amount of prevention will be *completely* successful . Forget the fingernail polish . I have finally settled upon a treatment that involves topical application of a combination of cortisone creme ( reduces the inflamation and swelling ) and benzocaine ( relieves the itch ) . I wo n't tell you all the things I 've tried . Nor will I tell you some of the things my wife does since this counts as minor surgery and is best not mentioned ( I also think it gains nothing ) . 7 . The swelling and itching can also be significantly relieved by the application of hot packs , and this seems to speed recovery as well . Doctors seem not to care much about chiggers . The urban and suburban doctors apparently do n't encounter them much . And the rural doctors seem to regard them as a force of nature that one must endure . I suspect that anyone who could come up with a good treatment for chiggers would make a *lot* of money . -- Gary H.

There is not a single doubt in my mind that every byte that passes every significant gateway or 'bone is captured for the colligation of data about __________ ? ( Maybe your name is here ) . Maybe we should start a newsgroup for the distribution of encrypted posts intended of members of affinity groups with a shared private key . For example at the coming up Cypherpunks meeting , a private key corresponding to that particular meeting could be passed out by a moderator . Minutes , followup comments to other participants , and so on could be posted to the alt.encrypted group for the use of the people who attended . Communiques intended by the group for non-attendees could of course just be signed using the private key but otherwises not encrypted . Starting a alt.encrypted newsgroup rather than just maintaining mailing lists is better for several reasons . First , it would be easier to archive for people who might join a group `` late '' and who might like to easily read earlier posts ; second , traffic analysis to know exactly to whom an affinity message is directed would be foiled ; three , a newsgroup is much more public and would serve to publicize available privacy measures on the internet .

There seems to be some confusion between rednecks and white trash . The confusion is understandable , as there is substantial overlap between the two sets . Let me see if I can clarify : Rednecks : Primarily use their backs instead of their minds to make a living . Usually somewhat ignorant ( by somebody 's standards , anyway ) because they have never held education above basic reading/writing/math skills to be that important to their eventual vocation . Note I did not say stupid , just ignorant . ( They might be stupid , but then so are some high percentage of any group ) . White trash : `` White trash fit the stereotype referred to by the word 'nigger ' better than any black person I ever met , only with the added 'bonus ' that white trash are mean as hell . '' -- my father . Genuinely lazy ( not just out of work or under- qualified ) , good-for-nothing , dishonest , white people who are mean as snakes . The `` squeal like a pig '' boys in _Deliverance_ may or may not have been rednecks , but they were sure as hell white trash .

Again , your desire for consistency disappears when it does not suit your needs . The principle of protecting life is abandoned based on `` action versus inaction . '' Not much of a principle .

Led by the priest , of course , which makes it a kind of dialogue we > present to God . But the best Masses I 've been to were participatory prayers . [ . . . ] Having lived through the kicking and screaming in the 60s and 70s as the Catholics were invited to participate in the liturgy instead of counting their rosary beads during Mass , I find this comment interesting . There is a _massively_ longer tradition for proclaiming the Passion accounts without active participation . If you know the Latin , one really beautiful way to hear the Passion is it 's being chanted by three deacons : the Narrator chants in the middle baritone range , Jesus chants in the bass , and others directly quoted are handled by a high tenor . This is actually the basis for the common proclamation of the Passion that John would prefer . But there is always a judgement call based on pastoral considerations . Each pastor makes his own decisions ( it is n't a church-wide conspiracy against participation ) . The Palm Sunday liturgy , with its initial blessing and distribution of the palms and procession , is already getting long before you get to the Passion ; some pastors feel that they should not make the people stand through that long narrative . Also , the orchestrated proclamation with multiple readers and public participation in the crowd quotations runs longer than the single-reader proclamation -- - in churches with multiple Masses for the Sunday , it might be necessary to go with the briefer options just to `` get 'em in and get 'em out '' . Each parish is different . Catholics are no longer canonically tied to their geographic parishes . It is possible that another Catholic parish in the Columbus area ( based on the Ohio State address ) has a liturgy closer to your preferences . Or talk to some of your fellow parishioners and see how common your preferences are -- - pastors generally ARE willing to listen to non-confrontational requests . Though you probably should bring along a paramedic in case he reacts too strongly to the shock of people asked for a _longer_ Sunday Mass . Perhaps the problem is that recent liturgical development has n't follow the continuous evolution model ( the accumulation of small changes , no single one of which is too hard to take ) but rather the punctuated equilibrium model ( things stay the same and we get accustomed to them , then the marked mutation hits ) . { My apologies if I am mis-remembering the names of the evolutionary theories . } -- -- - Tim Rolfe rolfe @ dsuvax.dsu.edu rolfe @ junior.dsu.edu RolfeT @ columbia.dsu.edu

This sounds real nice , but struck me as a little odd . You 're presenting yourself as if you were a straight Xian , who is sticking his neck out and taking on the challenge of speaking out in support of gays in the church . But I was under the impression that you yourself are gay . That 's all well and fine , but presenting yourself as sticking out your neck to help `` repressed others '' seems a bit untruthful under the circumstances ... . Walter

I ca n't help but wonder what would happen if all violence against Israelis stopped . Hopefully , violence against Arabs would stop at the same time . If a state of non-violence could be maintained , perhaps a state of cooperation could be achieved , i.e. , greater economic opportunities for both peoples living in the '' territories '' . Of course , given the current leadership of Israel , your way may work also - but if that leadership changes , e.g. , to someone with Ariel Sharon 's mentality , then I would predict a considerable loss of life , i.e. , no winners . Secondly , regarding your comment about the U.S. troops responding to `` stiff resistance '' - the analogy is not quite valid . The U.S. troops could get out of the neighborhood altogether . The Israelis could not . Just my $ .02 worth , no offense intended . Respectfully , Ben .

An expert in a field can also predict things based on experience . Beware of predictions like `` The volcano will erupt tomorrow !

Note also , that if I 'm describing a ( hypothetical ) death of a friend as a result of his passion for fast motorcycles , I might say `` his mother predicted he would die . '' Of course , his father may have said `` he 'll make good money because of his hobby '' and depending upon the final outcome of the situation I end up mentioning the one that's relevant . A reader down the road will get the impression that the mother or father had predicted accurately the event , when it was just a casual statement . Finally , on prophesies , note that there are many prophesies that can be fulfilled my people , often to fool believers . If I say , `` Beware , the terminal will unexpectedly be shut off ! '' and then after 2 secs I turn it off ( or have someone come out from another room and do it ) there was no prediction . A similar situation arises with the establishment of the Jewish state . While pressing for it , prominent Jews argued that it was predicted that they 'd have a state again , and that the time has come . ( I 've read this somewhere , but ca n't think of the source - if you can , please let me know . ) In this case , the establishment of the state does not really fulfill the prophesy since the prophesy was used in order to push for the establishment of the state . Deciding what was truely a fulfillment of prophesy is very tricky . -leo -- '' My mother wanted to save herself until marriage . Every |Leonidas Hepis day I thank God that she did n't .

Please spread the word ! Here 's some information about the events , and then a couple of messages from Jay Goguen of JPL appealing for thermal observations of the eclipse to learn more about the thermal properties of Iapetus . He might also have some money available ... John Spencer , 1993/04/21 Iapetus will be eclipsed by the shadows of Saturn 's rings and Saturn itself on 1993/05/01-02 ( 18:27-13:43 UT ) and again on 1993/07/20-21 , ( 21:16-09:38 UT ) . Timing is as follows ; 1993 May 1-2 A-ring ingress 18:27 egress 19:30 B-ring ingress 19:51 egress 21:42 C-ring egress 23:00 Saturn ingress 23:59 egress 10:02 B-ring ingress 10:28 egress 12:19 A-ring ingress 12:40 egress 13:43 1993 July 20-21 Saturn ingress 21:16 egress 05:08 A-ring ingress 05:13 ( grazing ) egress 09:38 Times could be 30 minutes later according to an alternate ephemeris , and photometric observations are important for refining Iapetus' orbit . Because the Sun 's size projected on the rings as seen from Iapetus is 3100 km it 's unlikely that we will learn anything new about the rings themselves from the observations . See Soma ( 1992 ) , Astronomy and Astrophysics 265 , L21-L24 for more details . Thanks to Andy Odell of Northern Arizona University for bringing the events to my attention . THERMAL OBSERVATIONS ? Jay Goguen ( jdg @ scn5.Jpl.Nasa.Gov ) writes : To me , the interesting thing to do would be thermal IR of the 20 July disappearance into the shadow of the planet to measure thermal inertia , etc . Unfortunately , the 21:30 UT of this event renders it inaccessible , except from Russia . Even from Calar Alto , Saturn is rising through 3 airmasses at 23:00 UT . Do you know anyone in Russia or Ukraine with a big telescope and 10 um instrumentation that 's looking for something to do ? I 'd be willing to make a personal grant of > $ 100 for the data . Jay and again : please try to encourage anyone that can observe the iapetus planet disappearance to do so at thermal wavelengths . My impression would be that it 's not an easy observation . Iapetus will be faint and getting fainter in eclipse , so you 'll need a big telescope that 's a good IR telescope and reasonable 10 - 20 um instrumentation . I don't think that combination is widely available at the longitudes that are well placed for observation . We need SOFIA for this one . One possibility would be the IR telescope in India , but it 's only a 1.2 m. jay ___ _____ ___ /_ /| /____/ \ /_ /| Ron Baalke | baalke @ kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov | | | | __ \ /| | | | Jet Propulsion Lab | ___| | | | |__ ) |/ | | |__ M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand /___| | | | ___/ | |/__ /| Pasadena , CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and |_____|/ |_|/ |_____|/ | part vegetable .

He/she can not make laws . If there is no law that covers a specific subject , say scam insurance companies , a regulator can not create one . So they have to go to a proper legislative body to get such a law enacted . For the California Insurance Commissioner , there are two possible legislative bodies : the California State Legislature and the U.S. Congress . We all know how little the California State Legislature accomplishes , esp . along the lines of insurance reform legislation ( negative movement ) . So Garamendi wants the feds to do it , because : ( a ) he has a better chance of getting a federal law through , and ( b ) since many of the scam companies work across state lines/national borders , it is better to have a law that reach out into other jurisdictions . > John Eaton > ! hp-vcd ! johne

I would hope that if you intend to have a reasonable discussion you might wait until I express an opinion before deciding I should be flamed for it . As for 'war ' I am not sure how I would define it . If you just look at attacks on villages then there is no way of deciding when it started . Would you count the riots in the 20 's and 30 's ? Violence but not war . I personally think that 'war ' , as opposed to civil disturbance or whatever , requires organisation , planning and some measure of regualr or semi-regular forces . Perhaps the Arab Liberation Army counts . I could easily be convinced it was so . From what I know they did not have a great deal of planning let alone organisation . The Haganah and Palmach certainly did . That is not a cause for criticism , it merely reflects the great organisation generally in the 'Zionist ' camp . > Of course , this is n't war , since it 's only the Arabs attacking . Now you are being silly are n't you ? In any case the war did NOT start with the invasion of the Arab Armies . You see we both agree on something . And the previous posters were wrong , no ? > Just like last week when the Fatah launched Katyusha rockets > against Northern israel . Where does uprising end and war begin ? Again I am not sure , I doubt you want my opinion anyway , but I think war requires organisation as I said before . It needs a group to command and plan . If Fatah lauches rockets from Southern Lebanon ( and are you sure you have the right group - not the Moslems again ? ) then that sounds like war to me . Stone throwing does not .

I am not from Wisconsin , but I have close relatives who live in Port Washington ( about 30 minutes north of Milwaukee ) , I visit the city regularly , and I have been in the Bradley four times to see the Admirals play and the NCAA Hockey Championships . It is a beautiful building . The Pettits and the city like to promote it as the best facility for hockey in North America . As to what will happen with the Admirals if Milwaukee does acquire a franchise , word is the team will move to Green Bay and play in the Brown County Arena . Once again , the Admirals are an independent franchise , and the people of Milwaukee have been supporting them well . The games I have been to have seen crowds anywhere from 10,000 to 13,000 , which are numbers some NHL teams ( i.e . the Islanders , Hartford , New Jersey ) would be envious of having on some nights .

If I were writing an interface to keyboard accelerators , I would have one resource called `` accelerators '' that took a translation table , period . I would also implement it so that programmer never has to do any work to get the accelerators installed . As soon as the end-user specified one , it would be active and automatically installed . To get multiple accelerators on a single menu item I 'd do something like : *menuItem.accelerators : # override \n\ Ctrl < Key > M : fire ( ) \n\ Shift < Key > L : fire ( ) \n The accelerators would work exactly like translations and you would automatically see a `` Ctrl M '' show up in your menuItem object .

The new cryptography scheme was announced today by the White House and the National Institute for Standards and Technology ( NIST ) , which will implement the technical specifications of the plan . A NIST spokesman acknowledged that the National Security Agency ( NSA ) , the super- secret military intelligence agency , had actually developed the encryption technology around which the new initiative is built . According to NIST , the technical specifications and the Presidential directive establishing the plan are classified . To open the initiative to public review and debate , CPSR today filed a series of Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) requests with key agencies , including NSA , NIST , the National Security Council and the FBI for information relating to the encryption plan . The CPSR requests are in keeping with the spirit of the Computer Security Act , which Congress passed in 1987 in order to open the development of non-military computer security standards to public scrutiny and to limit NSA 's role in the creation of such standards . CPSR previously has questioned the role of NSA in developing the so-called `` digital signature standard '' ( DSS ) , a communications authentication technology that NIST proposed for government-wide use in 1991 . After CPSR sued NIST in a FOIA lawsuit last year , the civilian agency disclosed for the first time that NSA had , in fact , developed that security standard . NSA is due to file papers in federal court next week justifying the classification of records concerning its creation of the DSS . David Sobel , CPSR Legal Counsel , called the administration 's apparent commitment to the privacy of electronic communications , as reflected in today 's official statement , `` a step in the right direction . '' But he questioned the propriety of NSA 's role in the process and the apparent secrecy that has thus far shielded the development process from public scrutiny . `` At a time when we are moving towards the development of a new information infrastructure , it is vital that standards designed to protect personal privacy be established openly and with full public participation . It is not appropriate for NSA -- an agency with a long tradition of secrecy and opposition to effective civilian cryptography -- to play a leading role in the development process . '' CPSR is a national public-interest alliance of computer industry professionals dedicated to examining the impact of technology on society . CPSR has 21 chapters in the U.S. and maintains offices in Palo Alto , California , Cambridge , Massachusetts and Washington , DC .

My whole point was not to say that the cars *couldn't* go that fast , but that they *shouldn't* go that fast . A family sedan designed to be operable at 85mph does n't suddenly become operable at 130mph because you added some plastic aero effects , slightly wider tires , and a much larger engine . That 's what the SHO is -- a slightly modified family sedan with a powerful engine . They did n't even bother improving the *brakes . * The Mustang is essentially the same deal as the SHO -- a big power plant stuck in a mid-size sedan , with almost no other modifications . I have real-life experience with the Mustang -- it handles like a brick ( except when you 're invoking oversteer , of course , something I personally avoid doing on the highway ) and stopping power is inadequate even from 80mph . Lots of accelleration -- but the rest of the car is not up to par . I picked the Porsche example because they are designed with speed in mind . It did n't have to be the 911 -- it could have been the much cheaper 944 or one of several Mercedes or Audi models . All of these cars are fairly expensive -- but so are the parts that make them drivable at high speed . This should be elementary . There are a few things to keep in mind about Europe , since you brought it up . My Autobahn knowledge is admittedly second-hand , but I believe the following to be true : 1 . Drivers are much better disciplined in Europe than they are here . 2 . The roads comprising the Autobahn are much better designed than they are here , and usually include animal fences . This makes them far more predictable than most US highways . 3 . Not all of Europe is the Autobahn . Most places in Europe have speed limits that are n't out-of-line with what we used to have in the US -- if my friends were n't lying to me they 're typically not much higher than 120km/h . I strongly suspect you wo n't find a lot of Rabbit owners doing 120mph ( nearly 200km/h ) on the Autobahn , but I could be wrong .

Look who 's talking : `` jumping to conclusions ? '' You would n't do that yourself , right ? All YOU address is your own convictions , regardless whether we come up with any Biblical scriptures which supports our points of view , because you reject such interpretations without any consideration whatsoever . # # The Bible states that Lucifer was created .

The Bible indeed does teach that not all are children of God in the sense that they '' belong to '' or follow God in His footsteps . Satan and his followers have rebelled against God , and are not `` children ( =followers/redeemed ) of God , '' but it does n't mean that they were not once created by God , but chose to separate themselves from those who chose to follow God and His plan of salvation . # # The field is the world ; the good seed are the children of the # kingdom ; but the tares are the children of the wicked `` one '' ; # ( Matthew 13:38 ) So ? -- This illustrates nicely what I just said : the children of the kingdom are those who have remained valiant in their testimony of Jesus ( and have shown `` works of repentance , etc . ) , and the children of the wicked one are those who rebelled against God and the lamb . The issue of satan 's spirit-offspring ( and those who followed him ) has not been addressed in this and other verses you copied from your Bible . You purposefully obscured the subject by swamping your `` right '' with non- related scriptures .

First get your lds-facts straight before you dare preaching to us about `` the only true God , '' whom you interpret according to your own likes and dislikes , but whose image I can not reconcile with what I know about Him myself . I guess your grandiose self-image does not allow for other faiths , believing in the divinity of Jesus Christ , but in a different way or fashion than your own . Not that it really matters , the mission and progress of the lds church will go on , boldly and nobly , and no mob or opponent can stop the work from progressing , until it has visited every continent , swept every clime , and sounded in every ear . # This is really a red herring .

'' I respect the former , I reject the latter without the remotest feeling that I have rejected Jesus . On the contrary . And by the way , I do respect your interpretations of the Bible , I even grant you being a Christian ( following your own image of Him ) , as much as I am a Christian ( following my own image of Him in my heart ) .

The indication from Rick is that they may # certainly be . The issue is , of course , that you love to use anything to either mis- represent or ridicule the lds church . The issue of `` official doctrine '' is obviously very important . McConkie 's views have been controversial ( e.g . `` The Seven Deadly Heresies '' has made me a heretic ! ; - ) at best , or erroneous at worst ( `` blacks not to receive the priesthood in this dispensation '' ) . I respect him as someone who has made his valuable contribution to the church , but I personally do NOT rely on his personal interpretations ( his book `` Mormon Doctrine '' is oftentimes referred to as `` McConkie 's Bible '' in mormon circles ) on mormon doctrine . I rather look to official ( doctrinal ) sources , and ... to Hugh Nibley 's books ! ( The last comment is an lds-insider reference . ) Summarizing : McConkie was a wise man who contributed undoubtedly far more to the kingdom of God than I have , but whose views are by no means dogma or accepted doctrine , some of it clearly belongs to personal interpretation and speculation . But having said this , I find McConkie ( even in his most biased and speculative moments ) far more thought-provoking than the trash coming from your proverbial pen .

If you multiplexed the EMG inputs at 10KHz , that would probably be sufficient for most physiology studies ( you 'd have ~ 330 Hz per channel sampling rate . ) That level of analog multiplexing should be rather easy to accomplish . Combining a lot of RF carriers is pretty tricky to do without generating intermodulation . A system to be carried by a runner is in a fairly harsh environment and would probably be difficult to keep balanced . A commercial hand-held transciever could probably be employed with a little modification to accomodate widening the bandwidth .

In comparison , in the United States , reported cases of gonorrhea in 1992 continued an overall decreasing trend ( 1 ) . This report summarizes an analysis of the increase in gonorrhea in Colorado in 1992 and characterizes trends in the occurrence of this disease from 1985 through 1992 . In 1992 , 4679 cases of gonorrhea were reported to the Colorado Department of Health ( CDH ) compared with 3901 cases reported in 1991 . During 1992 , reported cases increased 22.7 % and 17.5 % among females and males , respectively ( Table 1 ) . Similar increases occurred among blacks , whites , and Hispanics ( 15.6 % , 15.1 % , and 15.9 % , respectively ) ; however , the number of reported cases with race not specified increased 88 % from 1991 to 1992 and constituted 9.7 % of all reported cases in 1992 . Although the largest proportional increases by age groups occurred among persons aged 35-44 years ( 80.4 % ) and greater than or equal to 45 years ( 87.7 % ) , these age groups accounted for only 11.0 % of all reported cases in 1992 . Persons in the 15-19-year age group accounted for the largest number of reported cases of gonorrhea during 1992 and the highest age group-specific rate ( 639 per 100,000 ) . Reported cases of gonorrhea increased 32.9 % in the five-county Denver metropolitan area ( 1990 population : 1,629,466 ) but decreased elsewhere in the state ( Table 1 ) . Half the cases of gonorrhea in the Denver metropolitan area occurred in 8.4 % ( 34 ) of the census tracts ; these represent neighborhoods considered by sexually transmitted diseases ( STDs ) /acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) field staff to be the focus of gang and drug activity . When compared with 1991 , the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed among men in the Denver Metro Health Clinic ( DMHC , the primary public STD clinic in the Denver metropolitan area ) increased 33 % in 1992 , and the number of visits by males to the clinic increased 2.4 % . Concurrently , the number of cases diagnosed among women increased by 1 % . Among self-identified heterosexual men , the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed at DMHC increased 33 % and comprised 94 % of all cases diagnosed in males , while the number of cases diagnosed among self-identified homosexual men remained low ( 71 and 74 in 1991 and 1992 , respectively ) . Four selected laboratories in the metropolitan Denver area ( i.e. , HMO , university hospital , nonprofit family planning , and commercial ) were contacted to determine whether gonorrhea culture-positivity rates increased . Gonorrhea culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories contacted increased 23 % -33 % from 1991 to 1992 , while the rate was virtually unchanged in the fourth ( i.e. , nonprofit family planning ) . From 1985 through 1991 , reported cases of gonorrhea among whites and Hispanics in Colorado decreased ; in comparison , reported cases among blacks HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 14 Volume 6 , Number 10 April 20 , 1993 increased since 1988 ( Figure 1 ) . During 1988-1992 , the population in Colorado increased 9.9 % for blacks , 9.8 % for Hispanics , and 4.5 % for whites . In 1992 , the gonorrhea rate for blacks ( 1935 per 100,000 persons ) was 57 times that for whites ( 34 per 100,000 ) and 12 times that for Hispanics ( 156 per 100,000 ) ( Table 1 ) . Among black females , reported cases of gonorrhea increased from 1988 through 1992 in the 15-19-year age group ; among black males , cases increased from 1989 through 1992 in both the 15-19-and 20-24-year age groups .

JM Douglas , MD , Denver Dept of Health and Hospitals . Surveillance and Information Systems Br , Div of Sexually Transmitted Diseases and HIV Prevention , National Center for Prevention Svcs , CDC . Editorial Note : The increase in reported gonorrhea cases in Colorado in 1992 may represent an overall increase in the occurrence of this disease or more complete reporting stimulated by visitations to laboratories by CDH surveillance staff during 1991-1992 . The increases in confirmed gonorrhea cases at DMHC and in culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories suggest a real increase in gonorrhea rather than a reporting artifact . However , the stable culture-positivity rate in the nonprofit family planning laboratory ( which serves a network of clinics statewide ) indicates that the gonorrhea increase did not uniformly affect all segments of the population . One possible explanation for the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in Colorado may be gang- and drug-related sexual behavior , as implicated in a recent outbreak of drug-resistant gonorrhea and other STDs in Colorado Springs ( 2 ) . Although the high morbidity census tracts in the Denver metropolitan area coincide with areas of gang and drug activity , this hypothesis requires further assessment . To examine the possible role of drug use -- implicated previously as a factor contributing to the national increase in syphilis ( 3-6 ) -- the CDH STD/AIDS program is collecting information from all persons in whom gonorrhea is diagnosed regarding drug use , exchange of sex for money or drugs , and gang affiliation . The gonorrhea rate for blacks in Colorado substantially exceeds the national health objective for the year 2000 ( 1300 per 100,000 ) ( objective 19.1a ) ( 7 ) . Race is likely a risk marker rather than a risk factor for gonorrhea and other STDs . Risk markers may be useful for identifying groups at greatest risk for STDs and for targeting prevention efforts . Moreover , race- specific variation in STD rates may reflect differences in factors such as socioeconomic status , access to medical care , and high-risk behaviors . In response to the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in Colorado , interventions initiated by the CDH STD/AIDS program include 1 ) targeting partner notification in the Denver metropolitan area to persons in groups at increased risk ( e.g. , 15-19-year-old black females and 20-24-year-old black males ) ; 2 ) implementing a media campaign ( e.g. , public service radio HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 15 Volume 6 , Number 10 April 20 , 1993 announcements , signs on city buses , newspaper advertisements , and posters in schools and clinics ) to promote awareness of STD risk and prevention targeted primarily at high-risk groups , and 3 ) developing teams of peer educators to perform educational outreach in high-risk neighborhoods . The educational interventions are being developed and implemented with the assistance of members of the target groups and with input from a forum of community leaders and health-care providers .

HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 16 Volume 6 , Number 10 April 20 , 1993 Effectiveness in Disease and Injury Prevention Impact of Adult Safety-Belt Use on Restraint Use Among Children less than 11 Years of Age -- Selected States , 1988 and 1989 ====================================================== SOURCE : MMWR 42 ( 14 ) DATE : Apr 16 , 1993 Motor-vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death among children and young adults in the United States and account for more than 1 million years of potential life lost before age 65 annually ( 1 ) . Child safety seats and safety belts can substantially reduce this loss ( 2 ) . From 1977 through 1985 , all 50 states passed legislation requiring the use of child safety seats or safety belts for children . Although these laws reduce injuries to young children by an estimated 8 % -59 % ( 3,4 ) , motor-vehicle crash-related injuries remain a major cause of disability and death among U.S. children ( 1 ) , while the use of occupant restraints among children decreases inversely with age ( 84 % usage for those aged 0-4 years ; 57 % , aged 5-11 years ; and 29 % , aged 12-18 years ) ( 5 ) . In addition , parents who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to use restraints for their children ( 6 ) . To characterize the association between adult safety-belt use and adult-reported consistent use of occupant restraints for the youngest child aged less than 11 years within a household , CDC analyzed data obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System ( BRFSS ) during 1988 and 1989 . This report summarizes the findings from this study . Data were available for 20,905 respondents aged greater than or equal to 18 years in 11 states * that participated in BRFSS -- a population-based , random-digit-dialed telephone survey -- and administered a standard Injury Control and Child Safety Module developed by CDC . Of these respondents , 5499 ( 26 % ) had a child aged less than 11 years in their household . Each respondent was asked to specify the child 's age and the frequency of restraint use for that child . The two categories of child restraint and adult safety-belt use in this analysis were 1 ) consistent use ( i.e. , always buckle up ) and 2 ) less than consistent use ( i.e. , almost always , sometimes , rarely , or never buckle up ) . Data were weighted to provide estimates representative of each state . Software for Survey Data Analysis ( SUDAAN ) ( 7 ) was used to calculate point estimates and confidence intervals . Statistically significant differences were defined by p values of less than 0.05 . Each of the 11 states had some type of child restraint law . Of these , six ( Arizona , Kentucky , Maine , Nebraska , Rhode Island , and West Virginia ) had no law requiring adults to use safety belts ; four ( Idaho , Maryland , Pennsylvania , and Washington ) had a secondary enforcement mandatory safety-belt law ( i.e. , a vehicle had to be stopped for a traffic violation before a citation for nonuse of safety belts could be issued ) ; and one state ( New York ) had a primary enforcement mandatory safety-belt law ( i.e. , vehicles could be stopped for a safety-belt law violation alone ) . In nine states , child-passenger protection HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 17 Volume 6 , Number 10 April 20 , 1993 laws included all children aged less than 5 years , but the other two states used both age and size of the child as criteria for mandatory restraint use . The analysis in this report subgrouped states into 1 ) those having a law requiring adult safety-belt use ( law states ) , and 2 ) those without such a law ( no-law states ) . Overall , 21 % of children aged less than 11 years reportedly were not consistently restrained during automobile travel . Both child restraint use and adult restraint use were significantly higher ( p less than 0.05 , chi-square test ) in law states than in no-law states ( 81.1 % versus 74.3 % and 58.7 % versus 43.2 % , respectively ) . High rates of restraint use for children aged less than or equal to 1 year were reported by both adults indicating consistent and less than consistent safety-belt use ( Figure 1 ) . Adults with consistent use reported high rates of child-occupant restraint use regardless of the child 's age ( range : 95.5 % for 1-year-olds to 84.7 % for 10-year-olds ) . In comparison , for adults reporting less than consistent safety-belt use , the rate of child- occupant restraint use declined sharply by the age of the child ( range : 93.1 % for 1-year-olds to 28.8 % for 10-year-olds ) . When comparing children of consistent adult safety-belt users with children of less than consistent adult safety-belt users , 95 % confidence intervals overlap for the two youngest age groups ( i.e. , aged less than 1 and 1 year ) . Reported child-occupant restraint use in law states generally exceeded that in no-law states , regardless of age of child ( Table 1 ) . In addition , higher adult educational attainment was significantly associated with increased restraint use for children , a factor that has also been associated with increased adult safety-belt use ( 8 ) . Reported by : National Center for Injury Prevention and Control ; National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion , CDC . Editorial Note : The findings in this report are consistent with others indicating that adults who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to employ occupant restraints for their children ( 6,9 ) . Because these nonbelted adults are at increased risk of crashing and more likely to exhibit other risk-taking behaviors , children traveling with them may be at greater risk for motor-vehicle injury ( 10 ) . Educational attainment of adult respondents was inversely associated with child restraint use in this report . Accordingly , occupant-protection programs should be promoted among parents with low educational attainment . Because low educational attainment is often associated with low socioeconomic status , such programs should be offered to adults through health-care facilities that serve low-income communities or through federal programs ( i.e. , Head Start ) that are directed at parents with young children . Injury-prevention programs emphasize restraining young children . In addition , however , efforts must be intensified to protect child occupants as HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 18 Volume 6 , Number 10 April 20 , 1993 they become older . Parents , especially those with low educational attainment , those who do not consistently wear safety belts , and those from states that do not have mandatory safety-belt use laws , should be encouraged to wear safety belts and to protect their children by using approved child safety seats and safety belts . Finally , the increased use of restraints among children may increase their likelihood of using safety belts when they become teenagers -- the age group characterized by the lowest rate of safety-belt use and the highest rate of fatal crashes ( 5 ) .

SURVEILLANCE FOR AND COMPARISON OF BIRTH DEFECT PREVALENCES IN TWO GEOGRAPHIC AREAS -- UNITED STATES , 1983-88 Problem/Condition : CDC and some states have developed surveillance systems to monitor the birth prevalence of major defects . Reporting Period Covered : This report covers birth defects surveillance in metropolitan Atlanta , Georgia , and selected jurisdictions in California for the years 1983-1988 . Description of System : The California Birth Defects Monitoring Program and the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program are two population- based surveillance systems that employ similar data collection methods . The prevalence estimates for 44 diagnostic categories were based on data for 1983- 1988 for 639,837 births in California and 152,970 births in metropolitan Atlanta . The prevalences in the two areas were compared , adjusting for race , sex , and maternal age by using Poisson regression . Results : Regional differences in the prevalence of aortic stenosis , fetal alcohol syndrome , hip dislocation/dysplasia , microcephalus , obstruction of the kidney/ureter , and scoliosis/lordosis may be attributable to general diagnostic variability . However , differences in the prevalences of arm/hand limb reduction , encephalocele , spina bifida , or trisomy 21 ( Down syndrome ) are probably not attributable to differences in ascertainment , because these defects are relatively easy to diagnose . Interpretation : Regional differences in prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy termination may affect prevalences of trisomy 21 and spina bifida . However , the reason for differences in arm/hand reduction is unknown , but may be related to variability in environmental exposure , heterogeneity in the gene pool , or random variation . Actions Taken : Because of the similarities of these data bases , several collaborative studies are being implemented . In particular , the differences in the birth prevalence of spina bifida and Down syndrome will focus attention on the impact of prenatal diagnosis .

INFLUENZA -- UNITED STATES , 1988-89 Problem/Condition : CDC monitors the emergence and spread of new influenza virus variants and the impact of influenza on morbidity and mortality annually from October through May . Reporting Period Covered : This report covers U.S. influenza surveillance conducted from October 1988 through May 1989 . Description of System : Weekly reports from the vital statistics offices of 121 cities provided an index of influenza 's impact on mortality ; 58 WHO collaborating laboratories reported weekly identification of influenza viruses ; weekly morbidity reports were received both from the state and territorial epidemiologists and from 153 sentinel family practice physicians . Nonsystematic reports of outbreaks and unusual illnesses were received throughout the year . Results : During the 1988-89 influenza season , influenza A ( H1N1 ) and B viruses were identified in the United States with essentially equal frequency overall , although both regional and temporal patterns of predominance shifted over the course of the season . Throughout the season increases in the indices of influenza morbidity in regions where influenza A ( H1N1 ) predominated were similar to increases in regions where influenza B predominated . Only 7 % of identified viruses were influenza A ( H3N2 ) , but isolations of this subtype increased as the season waned , and it subsequently predominated during the 1989-90 season . During the 1988-89 season outbreaks in nursing homes were reported in association with influenza B and A ( H3N2 ) but not influenza A ( H1N1 ) . Interpretation : The alternating temporal and geographic predominance of influenza strains A ( H1N1 ) and B during the 1988-89 season emphasizes the importance of continual attention to regional viral strain surveillance , since amantadine is effective only for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A . Actions Taken : Weekly interim analyses of surveillance data produced throughout the season allow physicians and public health officials to make informed choices regarding appropriate use of amantadine . CDC 's annual surveillance allows the observed viral variants to be assessed as candidates for inclusion as components in vaccines used in subsequent influenza seasons . Authors : Louisa E.

Copyright 1993 , The University of Arizona High Tech Assisted Reproductive Technologies Following the birth of the first in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer ( IVF- ET ) baby in 1978 , a host of assisted reproductive technologies have been developed that include IVF-ET , gamete intrafallopian tube transfer ( GIFT ) , embryo cryopreservation ( freezing ) and gamete micromanipulation . Together , these technologies are referred to as the high-tech assisted reproductive technology ( ART ) procedures . Ovulation induction , sperm insemination and surgery for tubal disease and/or pathology still are the mainstays of the therapies available for infertility management . However , when these fail , it almost always is appropriate to proceed with one of the ART procedures . Therefore , in addition to a comprehensive basic and general infertility service at The University of Arizona Center for Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility , there is a program of Assisted Reproduction that specializes in ART procedures . This program serves as a tertiary provider for those patients in the state of Arizona whose infertility problems can not be resolved by the traditional therapies . The following article ( on back ) describes the ART procedures available in our Center , clarifies appropriate applications for each , and considers the realistic expectations for their success . Procedures included are : o in vitro o fertilization - embryo transfer ( IVF-ET ) , gamete intrafallopian tube transfer o ( GIFT ) , cryopreservation of human embryos and gamete micromanipulation . This article also considers ongoing research in our program that is directed towards improved success of these technologies . HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 24 Volume 6 , Number 10 April 20 , 1993 Future Areas of Research In addition to ongoing research that is directed exclusively toward the management of infertile couples , we are developing the technology to assist couples who are at risk for producing embryos with a serious hereditary disease . This technology involves biopsying the preimplantation human embryo and then subjecting the biopsied cells to genetic analysis using either DNA amplification or fluorescent in situ hybridization . There are recent reports of the successful application of DNA amplification by other centers , for example , for diagnosis of the genes for cystic fibrosis and hemophilia . We hope to apply and further focus fluorescent in situ hybridization technology for probing the X chromosome , the identification of which will provide a scientific basis for counselling patients who exhibit sex-linked disorders . The considerable clinical application of such technology lies in the fact that it circumvents the need for prenatal diagnosis , in addition to the possibility of a subsequent termination of affected fetuses , in order to avoid the birth of affected children . Catherine Racowsky , Ph.D . Associate Professor and Director of Research Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology College of Medicine University of Arizona Tucson , Arizona Applications , Success Rates and Advances for the Management of Infertility The following are the ART procedures available at The University of Arizona Center for Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility . In Vitro Fertilization - Embryo Transfer is the core ART procedure of our Assisted Reproduction Program . This procedure involves retrieval of unfertilized eggs from the ovary , their insemination in vitro in a dish , and the culture of resultant embryos for 1 or 2 days , before they are transferred to the patient 's uterus . All cultures are maintained in an incubator under strictly controlled atmospheric and temperature conditions . Before being processed for use in insemination , semen samples are evaluated in our andrology laboratory using both subjective light microscopy and computer- HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 25 Volume 6 , Number 10 April 20 , 1993 assisted semen analyses . To ensure an adequate number of eggs with which to perform IVF-ET , or indeed , GIFT , follicular development is typically stimulated , with gonadotropins ( perganol , metrodin ) , gonadotropin releasing hormone ( GnRH , Factrel , lutrepulse ) and/or GnRH analogues ( lupron , Depo lupron , synarel ) . Occasionally , however , IVF-ET is accomplished with eggs obtained in non-stimulated cycles . While some programs utilize laparoscopic egg retrieval in the operating room with the patient under general anesthesia , we undertake the less costly approach of ultrasound-guided retrieval in our Infertility Unit , with the patient sedated . Couples who resort to IVF-ET exhibit such pathologies as tubal deficiencies , ovulatory dysfunction , endometriosis , and/or mild forms of male factor infertility . According to the United States IVF Registry , the overall success rate for IVF-ET nationwide has stabilized at about 14 percent per cycle . Results from our program , involving 86 patients who have undergone 173 IVF-ET cycles , reflect a comparable success rate . Nevertheless , the overall incidence of success with this procedure is disconcertingly low and emphasizes the need to address those physiological factors that limit achievement of a higher percentage of pregnancies . Well recognized predictors of outcome include patient age , response to exogenous ovarian stimulation , quality of sperm and number of repeated IVF-ET cycle attempts . However , among these , age is the single most significant determinant of conception . Therefore , it is critical that such patients are referred to an Assisted Reproduction Program at the earliest opportunity following failure of traditional therapies . The underlying basis for the negative effect of age on fertility has not been clearly delineated beyond recognition that : 1 ) the number of eggs available for retrieval declines markedly with age ; 2 ) fertilization rates significantly decrease in eggs retrieved from patients who are over 40 years ; and 3 ) provided the appropriate hormonal background is present , age is unrelated to uterine competency to sustain pregnancy . Ongoing research in our Center , therefore , is investigating physiological changes in the egg that may be impacted by age . We have determined that more than 50 percent of eggs that fail to fertilize in vitro are chromosomally abnormal , and that a significant proportion of these abnormalities are accountable to patient age . Currently , the only recourse for such patients is to use eggs obtained from a donor . Our program has initiated recruitment of volunteer egg donors to satisfy the needs of a list of recipients interested in this form of therapy . GIFT - This high-tech ART procedure is performed in the operating room , usually with the use of a laparoscope and , in contrast to IVF-ET , involves introducing sperm and freshly retrieved eggs into the lumen of the Fallopian tube ( an average of 3 eggs/tube ) . Under these circumstances , fertilization occurs in vivo and , if excess eggs are retrieved , the remainder undergo IVF , with subsequent options for embryo transfer in that cycle , or freezing for transfer in a subsequent cycle . This ART procedure is applied to cases in HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 26 Volume 6 , Number 10 April 20 , 1993 which there is at least one patent Fallopian tube but the couple has such pathologies as ovulatory dysfunction , endometriosis , male factor infertility and/or idiopathic infertility . The data reported in the United States IVF Registry for 1985 through 1990 indicate that the overall success rate with GIFT is higher than that obtained with the IVF-ET technique ( range of clinical pregnancies for GIFT is 24 to 36 percent and for IVF-ET 14 to 18 percent ) . In view of this fact , one might expect more patients to be treated with GIFT than IVF-ET . However , in our program we have taken into account three basic concerns which , while substantially reducing the number of GIFT cycles performed , benefit the patient . These concerns are : 1 ) the increased costs associated with performing a procedure in the operating room ; 2 ) the risks , albeit minimal , of undergoing general anesthesia ; and 3 ) the considerable benefits to be accrued from obtaining direct information on the quality and fertilizability of the eggs , and the developmental competency of resultant embryos . The increased success with GIFT undoubtedly reflects the artificial environment provided by the laboratory in the IVF-ET procedure . Between January 1 , 1991 , and December 31 , 1992 , we have performed a total of 12 GIFT cycles , with an overall success rate of 20 percent . Embryo cryopreservation , or freezing , is applied in our program when embryos result from residual GIFT eggs or from non-transferred IVF embryos . This procedure not only provides patients with a subsequent opportunity for success at much reduced costs , but also circumvents the legal and ethical issues relating to disposal of supernumerary embryos . Therefore , as stipulated by the American Fertility Society ethical guidelines for ART programs , from both a practical and an ethical standpoint , all Assisted Reproduction programs should have the capability of cryopreserving human embrys . Gamete Micromanipulation - This ART procedure , which is still very new , is applied to couples who are unaccepting of insemination with donor semen but who have severe male factor infertility ( less than 10 million sperm/ml in combination with fewer than 20 perccent motile sperm , and/or less than 10 percent sperm with normal morphology ) . We are currently developing the procedure of sub-zonal insertion ( SZI ) , which entails injecting sperm under the coating around the egg , the barrier normally penetrated by the sperm through enzymatic digestion . Available data from SZI programs world-wide indicate that only 5 to 10 percent of SZI cycles result in a pregnancy . This statistic undoubtedly relates to limitations imposed by abnormalities inherent in the sperm . Therefore , we are currently focusing on the development of improved techniques for the recognition and selection of sperm chosen for manipulation . Such efforts are unquestionably worthwhile in view of the fact that this technology offers the only realistic opportunity for severe male factor patients to establish conception .

As part of my self-introduction to X I 've been trying to do some simple icon animation ( sort of like icondoit from mswindows ) . Changing your own applications icon is fairly simple : If you have a widget ID you can just XtSetValues on XtNiconifyPixmap ( or whatever ) and you 're done . Alternately you can set window manager hints . These methods do n't seem to work with icons which your application does n't specifically own . In my situation I have to change the icon of random windows sitting there in my icon box so my question is : Given a window-id , how do you change the icon pixure ? A working example would be very much appreciated . If it makes any difference , I 'm using motif 1.1 on VMS T6.0-5KE . Thanks - Scott : )

The problem : APPLICATION ERROR from WIN31 I started off with a newly installed WIN31 and then installed EXCEL . Run excel , no problem . A permanent swap file of size 18K was in place for windows . Ok , I then proceed to install Norton Desktop for Windows version 2.0 . No problem with the installation . I also allow NDW to alter my autoexec.bat ( with the nav running on c : ) . The problem came when I try to ( bring up excel or if excel is running and right in the middle of it - like click a selection with the mouse ) from the desktop . First of all , I always get the application error screen followed by another application error screen with various different messages . The following are some of them : - Stack fault , by TC1024.DRV at address 0001 : XXXX where XXXX is some number . ( TC1024.DRV is the VGA driver provided by the manufacture ) - General protection fault , by ndw.exe at the same address - Segment load failure , by ndw.exe at same address Some how , the address flagged was always 0001 : something . What is address 0001 : XXXX means ? I have absolutely on idea what this mean . I tried commented out the TSR programs from autoexec.bat , no help . Is it something to do with the emm386 setup which is not telling WIN31 what it suppose to know .

Later he seems to have risen to chief prominence worshipped by the Persians . Associated with the Sun but NOT the Sun , he is the lord of contract honor and obedience , therefore naturally worshipped by soldiers . He was ordered by the Sun to slay the bull of heaven and He reluct- antly agreed because of His obligation ... the blood of that bull spilled and grew all earth life ... then Mitra and the Sun sat down to eat . Worship of Lord Mitra ended in Persia with the ascension of the Zoroastrians . Hundreds of years later He was rediscovered and thrown into the Official Roman Pantheon ( tm ) for some semi-tricky reason , I forget why . But all references of Him ended abruptly when He was stricken from same , so apparently His worship was some sort of vehicle for advancement in the bureaucracy , like membership in the Communist Party was in the Soviet Bloc . The sociology of religion in ancient times is fascinating ! Oh , His B-day was 25 Dec. Ahem . I am not sure if the mystery cult really lasted after His was booted from the Roman Imperial God Roster or what . It contained mostly soldiers , with 7 levels of initiation . They worshipped underground in caverns in pews . The bull horns in those temples were for scaring away or impaling evil spirits , I 'm not sure that they had Mithraic significance or not . I do n't know that the ritual meal was of a cannibalistic nature as is the Christian masses . But eating deities goes way back to Old Kingdom Egypt . Someone mentioned bullfighting . Did Mithraists sacrifice bulls ? I forget . More likely , for a religious source , might be the shower of bull 's blood enjoyed by the worshippers of Cybele on the Day of Blood ?

Need I say more ? There is also the question of what is meant by `` atheist '' . A familiar example of the importance of the meaning of the word is as follows .

Statements ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) require belief . Many atheists ( myself included ) take the following position : ( 5 ) I do not believe that there is a god . ( 6 ) I do not believe that there is not a god . That is , I harbor no beliefs at all , there is no good evidence for god existing or not . Some folks call this agnosticism . It does not suffer from `` blind faith '' at all . I think of it as `` Do n't worry , be happy '' .

Have you considered Josephus , the Jewish Historian , > who also wrote of Jesus ? In addition , the four gospel accounts > are very much in harmony . Bill , I have taken the time to explain that biblical scholars consider the Josephus reference to be an early Christian insert . By biblical scholar I mean an expert who , in the course of his or her research , is willing to let the chips fall where they may . This excludes literalists , who may otherwise be defined as biblical apologists . They find what they want to find . They are not trustworthy by scholarly standards ( and others ) . Why an insert ? Read it - I have , a number of times . The passage is glaringly out of context , and Josephus , a superb writer , had no such problem elsewhere in his work . The passage has *nothing* to do with the subject matter in which it lies . It suddenly appears and then just as quickly disappears . Until you can demonstrate how and why the scholarly community is wrong about the Josephus insert , your `` proof '' is meaningless and it should not be repeated here . What 's more , even if Josephus happened to be legitimate , it would `` prove '' nothing . Scholars speak of the `` weight of evidence . '' Far more independent evidence would be required to validate your claim . Until forthcoming , your belief is based on faith . That 's OK , but you exceed your rights when you pass faith off as fact . As for the gospels , there are parallels , but there are also glaring inconsistencies and contradictions . Should n't a perfect canon be perfect ? Should n't there be absolutely no room for debate ? I suggest you read _Gospel Fictions_ by Randel Helms , and _The Unauthorized Version_ by Robin Fox ( for Herb Huston , no known kinship or familial relationship , but we do indeed share an evolutionary ancestry ) . The fact that there are inconsistencies , gaps and contradictions does not deny your position . On the other hand , neither do the gospels `` prove '' your faith . Independent evidence is necessary , and I know of none ( which we have already discussed , and so far you have not provided any ) . Until then , its faith . Moreover , you have committed a fundamental error in logic . You have attempted to `` prove '' your claim with that which you want to prove . Its no different than saying `` I am right because I say so . '' Your logic is full of circles . It reminds me a bit of the 1910 Presbyterian General Assembly . The assembly defined five fundamentals ( this is where '' fundamentalist '' came from ) of orthodox Protestant Christianity , to wit : 1 ) Jesus performed miracles , 2 ) Jesus was born of a virgin , 3 ) Jesus was bodily resurrected , 4 ) Jesus ' crucifixion atoned for human sin , and - here is the clincher - 5 ) the bible is the inerrant word of God . Presbyterians construe '' inerrant '' broadly as spritually inerrant . Fundamentalists take the first four as literally true , and then validate them with a literally inerrant bible , which contains the first four , and which is the only thing known to contain the first four . Smoke and mirrors and wands and hand waving if ever there was ! Its faith , Bill . You do n't have any more or better truths than anyone else . Whatever works for you . Just do n't foist it on others . Regards , Rich Fox , Anthro , Usouthdakota

Fuel injector cleaning is done properly with a can of injector cleaner solvent which is hooked up to the fuel system under high pressure . The car is actually run on the solvent during the cleaning process . The equipment to properly do this is pricey , and generally not something the average home mechanic has . The solvent itself is not very expensive ( $ 5- $ 8 ) and you could probably make up a hose to fit your system and do it yourself , but I did n't tell you that ... : - ) Not many in-tank cleaners are worth wasting your money on . There has been a discussion of these products on here from time to time , and Chevron Techron ( not Pro-Gard with Techron ) is generally regarded as the best . It is , however , a bit more than $ 1.29 a bottle . IMHO , it will not substitute for proper injector cleaning if they are really crudded up .

From : mhsu @ lonestar.utsa.edu ( Melinda . Hsu ) Subject : Re : The arrogance of Christians Organization : University of Texas at San Antonio Lines : 74 I 'd like to share my thoughts on this topic of `` arrogance of Christians '' and look forward to any responses . In my encounters with Christians , I find myself dismayed by their belief that their faith is total truth . According to them , their beliefs come from the Bible and the bible is the word of God and God is truth - thus they know the truth . This stance makes it difficult to discuss other faiths with them and my own hesitations about Christianity because they see no other way . Their way is the 'truth . ' But I see their faith arising from a willful choice to believe a particular way . That choice is part faith and part reason , but it seems to me a choice . My discussions with some Christians remind me of schoolyard discussions when I was in grade school : A kid would say , `` All policemen are jerks ! '' I 'd ask , `` How do you know ? '' `` Because my daddy told me so ! '' `` How do you know you 're daddy is right ? '' `` He says he 's always right ! '' Well the argument usually stops right there . In the end , are n't we all just kids , groping for the truth ? If so , do we have the authority to declare all other beliefs besides our own as false ? -- -- -- -- -- -- - This is only my third time browsing through this newsgroup . I apologize if I 'm covering tired old ground . Some of the discussions on this topic have piqued my interest and I welcome any comments . | Louis J.

I can understand criticisms of Christianity that say there 's not enough evidence to believe it , or that there 's just as good evidence for other religions . I do n't agree , but clearly there are plenty of intelligent people who do n't find the evidence convincing . But that does n't seem to be your point . Rather , you seem upset that people who believe Christianity is true also believe that things which contradict it are false . This suggests a model of spiritual things that 's rather different than the Christian one . It sounds more like an existentialist view , where people choose what value to follow , but there 's no actual independent spiritual reality , and so no way to say that a specific choice is in some unique sense right . This sort of model -- with modifications of one sort or another -- may be appropriate for some religions . But Christianity is in its essense a `` historical '' religion . That is , it's based on the concept that there are actual spiritual entities out there , that one of them has intervened in history in specific ways , and that we see evidence of that in history . In the `` mundane '' world , we are not free to choose how things work . When we drop something , it falls ( aside from well-defined situations where it does n't ) . The Christian concept is that spiritual matters , there is also an actual external reality . I hope we 're all honest enough not to claim that we have perfect understanding . But while we may not think we know everything , we are confident that we know some things . And that implies that we think things that contradict them are false . I don't see how else we could proceed . This need n't result in arrogance . I 'm certainly interested in talking with people of other religions . They may have things to teach me , and even if they do n't , I respect them as fellow human beings . But it's got to be possible to respect people and also think that on some matters they are wrong . Maybe even disasterously wrong . -- clh ]

From : boebert @ sctc.com ( Earl Boebert ) Subject : Removing Distortion From Bitmapped Drawings ? Organization : SCTC Lines : 47 Let 's say you have a scanned image of a line drawing ; in this case a boat , but it could be anything . On the drawing you have a set of reference points whose true x , y positions are known . Now you digitize the drawing manually ( in this case , using Yaron Danon 's excellent Digitize program ) . That is , you use a program which converts cursor positions to x , y and saves those values when you click the mouse . Upon digitizing you notice that the reference point values that come out of the digitizing process differ in small but significant ways from the known true values . This is understandable because the scanned drawing is a reproduction of the original and there are successive sources of distortion such as differential expansion and contraction of paper , errors introduced in the printing process , scanner errors and what have you . The errors are not uniform over the entire drawing , so `` global '' adjustments such as stretching/contracting uniformly over x or y , or rotating the whole drawing , are not satisfactory . So the question is : does any kind soul know of an algorithm for removing such distortion ? In particular , if I have three sets of points Reference ( x , y ) ( the known true values ) DistortedReference ( x , y ) ( the same points , with known errors ) DistortedData ( x , y ) ( other points , with unknown errors ) what function of Reference and Distorted could I apply to DistortedData to remove the errors . I suspect the problem could be solved by treating the distorted reference points as resulting from the projection of a `` bumpy '' 3d surface , solving for the surface and then `` flattening '' it to remove the errors in the other data points . Any kind and informed soul out there have any ideas , or better yet , pointers to treatments of the same or similar problems ? Thanks , Earl

From : john @ wa3wbu.UUCP ( John Gayman ) Subject : Another happy Gateway owner Organization : WA3WBU , Marysville , PA Lines : 43 Since I 've been seeing all kinds of complaints regarding Gateways lately on here , I thought I post my recent pleasant experiences . My machine ( 4DX2-66V ) this past Friday . This was two weeks to the DAY from when I called the order in . Upon unboxing it I found everything to be in perfect order . All the peripherals I ordered were properly installed ( Jumbo-250 & CD-ROM ) . I was very impressed with the quantity and quality of the Gateway documentation . All software came with the original disks and manuals . The Gateway manual itself is in a nice 3-ring binder . The ATI GUP came with build59 drivers . All other software I specified ( Microsoft Office ) was properly installed . The machine came right up out of the box and has been performing flawlessly . It 's been on all weekend and it hardly even reaches room temperature . I think the big roomy tower case has a lot to do with it . It 's up and running DOS 6.0 with no problems . I 've also read about some people having problems with high speed serial communications . I used the DOS 6.0 InterLink program which lets me link to my old computer via a serial port at 115.2K baud . It then `` maps '' the other machines two hard disks as my disks F & G. You can `` cd '' to these drives and either run programs or copy files . It 's almost like a peer-peer lan except you can also *run* programs on the other machine . It 's not a two way street . The other machine is the server and this machine is the client . So thats where it seems to differ from the peer to peer stuff . For a bundled DOS utility its very impressive . My Jumbo-250 took about 11 minutes to back up 117MB of data . I also by-passed any potential Gateway monitor problems by taking the $ 430 credit and applying it towards a NEC 4FG . I love this monitor !

The net ca n't set public policy , that 's what your representatives are for . WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SATURN V PLANS Despite a widespread belief to the contrary , the Saturn V blueprints have not been lost . They are kept at Marshall Space Flight Center on microfilm . The problem in re-creating the Saturn V is not finding the drawings , it is finding vendors who can supply mid-1960 's vintage hardware ( like guidance system components ) , and the fact that the launch pads and VAB have been converted to Space Shuttle use , so you have no place to launch from . By the time you redesign to accommodate available hardware and re-modify the launch pads , you may as well have started from scratch with a clean sheet design . WHY DATA FROM SPACE MISSIONS IS N'T IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE Investigators associated with NASA missions are allowed exclusive access for one year after the data is obtained in order to give them an opportunity to analyze the data and publish results without being `` scooped '' by people uninvolved in the mission . However , NASA frequently releases examples ( in non-digital form , e.g . photos ) to the public early in a mission . RISKS OF NUCLEAR ( RTG ) POWER SOURCES FOR SPACE PROBES There has been extensive discussion on this topic sparked by attempts to block the Galileo and Ulysses launches on grounds of the plutonium thermal sources being dangerous . Numerous studies claim that even in worst-case scenarios ( shuttle explosion during launch , or accidental reentry at interplanetary velocities ) , the risks are extremely small . Two interesting data points are ( 1 ) The May 1968 loss of two SNAP 19B2 RTGs , which landed intact in the Pacific Ocean after a Nimbus B weather satellite failed to reach orbit . The fuel was recovered after 5 months with no release of plutonium . ( 2 ) In April 1970 , the Apollo 13 lunar module reentered the atmosphere and its SNAP 27 RTG heat source , which was jettisoned , fell intact into the 20,000 feet deep Tonga Trench in the Pacific Ocean . The corrosion resistant materials of the RTG are expected to prevent release of the fuel for a period of time equal to 10 half-lives of the Pu-238 fuel or about 870 years [ DOE 1980 ] . To make your own informed judgement , some references you may wish to pursue are : A good review of the technical facts and issues is given by Daniel Salisbury in `` Radiation Risk and Planetary Exploration -- The RTG Controversy , '' *Planetary Report* , May-June 1987 , pages 3-7 .

Studies indicate that they in reality have only a minute impact , both in absolute terms and relative to other chemical sources . The remainder of this item is a response from the author of the quoted study , Charles Jackman . The atmospheric modelling study of the space shuttle effects on the stratosphere involved three independent theoretical groups , and was organized by Dr. Michael Prather , NASA/Goddard Institute for Space Studies . The three groups involved Michael Prather and Maria Garcia ( NASA/GISS ) , Charlie Jackman and Anne Douglass ( NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center ) , and Malcolm Ko and Dak Sze ( Atmospheric and Environmental Research , Inc. ) . The effort was to look at the effects of the space shuttle and Titan rockets on the stratosphere . The following are the estimated sources of stratospheric chlorine : Industrial sources : 300,000,000 kilograms/year Natural sources : 75,000,000 kilograms/year Shuttle sources : 725,000 kilograms/year The shuttle source assumes 9 space shuttles and 6 Titan rockets are launched yearly . Thus the launches would add less than 0.25 % to the total stratospheric chlorine sources . The effect on ozone is minimal : global yearly average total ozone would be decreased by 0.0065 % . This is much less than total ozone variability associated with volcanic activity and solar flares . The influence of human-made chlorine products on ozone is computed by atmospheric model calculations to be a 1 % decrease in globally averaged ozone between 1980 and 1990 . The influence of the space shuttle and Titan rockets on the stratosphere is negligible . The launch schedule of the Space Shuttle and Titan rockets would need to be increased by over a factor of a hundred in order to have about the same effect on ozone as our increases in industrial halocarbons do at the present time . Theoretical results of this study have been published in _The Space Shuttle 's Impact on the Stratosphere_ , MJ Prather , MM Garcia , AR Douglass , CH Jackman , M.K.W . Ko and N.D.

HOW LONG CAN A HUMAN LIVE UNPROTECTED IN SPACE If you *don't* try to hold your breath , exposure to space for half a minute or so is unlikely to produce permanent injury . Holding your breath is likely to damage your lungs , something scuba divers have to watch out for when ascending , and you 'll have eardrum trouble if your Eustachian tubes are badly plugged up , but theory predicts -- and animal experiments confirm -- that otherwise , exposure to vacuum causes no immediate injury . You do not explode . Your blood does not boil . You do not freeze . You do not instantly lose consciousness . Various minor problems ( sunburn , possibly `` the bends '' , certainly some [ mild , reversible , painless ] swelling of skin and underlying tissue ) start after ten seconds or so . At some point you lose consciousness from lack of oxygen . Injuries accumulate . After perhaps one or two minutes , you 're dying . The limits are not really known .

HOW THE CHALLENGER ASTRONAUTS DIED The Challenger shuttle launch was not destroyed in an explosion . This is a well-documented fact ; see the Rogers Commission report , for example . What looked like an explosion was fuel burning after the external tank came apart . The forces on the crew cabin were not sufficient to kill the astronauts , never mind destroy their bodies , according to the Kerwin team 's medical/forensic report . The astronauts were killed when the more-or-less intact cabin hit the water at circa 200MPH , and their bodies then spent several weeks underwater . Their remains were recovered , and after the Kerwin team examined them , they were sent off to be buried . USING THE SHUTTLE BEYOND LOW EARTH ORBIT You ca n't use the shuttle orbiter for missions beyond low Earth orbit because it ca n't get there . It is big and heavy and does not carry enough fuel , even if you fill part of the cargo bay with tanks . Furthermore , it is not particularly sensible to do so , because much of that weight is things like wings , which are totally useless except in the immediate vicinity of the Earth . The shuttle orbiter is highly specialized for travel between Earth 's surface and low orbit . Taking it higher is enormously costly and wasteful . A much better approach would be to use shuttle subsystems to build a specialized high-orbit spacecraft . [ Yet another concise answer by Henry Spencer . ] THE `` FACE ON MARS '' There really is a big rock on Mars that looks remarkably like a humanoid face . It appears in two different frames of Viking Orbiter imagery : 35A72 ( much more facelike in appearance , and the one more often published , with the Sun 10 degrees above western horizon ) and 70A13 ( with the Sun 27 degrees from the west ) . Science writer Richard Hoagland has championed the idea that the Face is artificial , intended to resemble a human , and erected by an extraterrestrial civilization . Most other analysts concede that the resemblance is most likely accidental . Other Viking images show a smiley-faced crater and a lava flow resembling Kermit the Frog elsewhere on Mars . There exists a Mars Anomalies Research Society ( sorry , don't know the address ) to study the Face . The Mars Observer mission will carry an extremely high-resolution camera , and better images of the formation will hopefully settle this question in a few years . In the meantime , speculation about the Face is best carried on in the altnet group alt.alien.visitors , not sci.space or sci.astro . V. DiPeitro and G.

Organization : Youngstown State/Youngstown Free-Net Lines : 28 NNTP-Posting-Host : yfn.ysu.edu I am so tired about all this debate on how many gays there are ! Such arguments are basically worthless , imho . Would it really matter if it were millions of people who are regularly denied access to housing , employment , and personal security or even only one ? As for death threats , I happen to know from personal experience that gay people are far more likely to receive them based on political veiws or even personal philosophies related to the issue of sexual orientation than are heterosex uals . Not a week goes by that I personally or one of my friends is not physically or verbally harrassed for even appearing to be gay . Everyone is garaunteed certain unalienable rights under our current form of government in theory , yet every day gay people are victimized by their local governments , by the police force , and by ( for the most part ) an uninformed and ignorant public . Is this democracy ? I do n't think so . A society 's sense of justice is judged on the basis of the treatment of the people who make up that society . All of those people . And yes , that includes gays , lesbians , and bisexuals whose `` crimes '' have no victims , and who are as varied and diverse as the society of wich they are a part . -- Frank Jordan  [ D [ D [ D [ C [ C [ C Gay Arab Bassoonists UNITE ! ! !

From : stefan @ prague ( Stefan Fielding-Isaacs ) Subject : Racelist : WHO WHAT WHERE Distribution : rec Organization : Gain Technology , Palo Alto , CA . Lines : 111 Nntp-Posting-Host : prague.gain.com Greetings fellow motorcycle roadracing enthusiasts ! BACKGROUND -- -- -- -- -- The racing listserver ( boogie.EBay.sun.com ) contains discussions devoted to racing and racing-related topics . This is a pretty broad interest group . Individuals have a variety of backgrounds : motojournalism , roadracing from the perspective of pit crew and racers , engineering , motosports enthusiasts . The size of the list grows weekly . We are currently at a little over one hundred and eighty-five members , with contributors from New Zealand , Australia , Germany , France , England , Canada Finland , Switzerland , and the United States . The list was formed ( October 1991 ) in response to a perceived need to both provide technical discussion of riding at the edge of performance ( roadracing ) and to improve on the very low signal-to-noise ratio found in rec.motorcycles . Anyone is free to join . Discussion is necessarily limited by the rules of the list to issues related to racing motorcycles and is to be `` flame-free '' . HOW TO GET THE DAILY DISTRIBUTION -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - You are welcome to subscribe . To subscribe send your request to : race-request @ boogie.EBay.Sun.COM Traffic currently runs between five and twenty-five messages per day ( depending on the topic ) . NB : Please do _not_ send your subscription request to the list directly . After you have contacted the list administrator , you will receive an RSVP request . Please respond to this request in a timely manner so that you can be added to the list . The request is generated in order to insure that there is a valid mail pathway to your site . Upon receipt of your RSVP , you will be added to either the daily or digest distribution ( as per your initial request ) . HOW TO GET THE DIGEST DISTRIBUTION -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- It is possible to receive the list in 'digest'ed form ( ie . a single email message ) . The RoadRacing Digest is mailed out whenever it contains enough interesting content . Given the frequency of postings this appears to be about every other day . Should you wish to receive the list via digest ( once every 30-40K or so ) , please send a subscription request to : digest-request @ boogie.EBay.Sun.COM HOW TO POST TO THE LIST -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - This is an open forum . To post an article to the list , send to : race @ boogie.EBay.Sun.COM Depending on how mail is set up at your site you may or may not see the mail that you have posted . If you want to see it ( though this is n't necessarily a guarantee that it went out ) you can include a `` metoo '' line in your .mailrc file ( on UNIX based mail systems ) . BOUNCES -- -- -- - Because I have n't had the time ( or the inclination to replace the list distribution mechanism ) we still have a problem with bounces returning to the poster of a message . Occasionally , sites or users go off-line ( either leaving their place of employment prematurely or hardware problems ) and you will receive bounces from the race list . Check the headers carefully , and if you find that the bounce originated at Sun ( from whence I administer this list ) contact me through my administration hat ( race-request @ boogie.EBay.sun.com ) .

The only difference is the time the driver gets loaded . mouse.sys will be loaded during the config.sys and therefor before the command.com . mouse.com will be loaded during autoexec.bat and so after the command.com . > which one is better ? mouse.com could be started from the commandline after the booting and it could - perhaps - be unloaded , if no other driver is loaded after it . The working of both drivers is totally the same . When I ran dos , I preferred loading most of the drivers in autoexec.bat , because some programs wo n't run with some drivers and I could choose the ones I needed during startup . But with DRDOS6 , this advantage is gone , because DRDOS lets you choose in config.sys which drivers should be loaded .

So your are saying to rely on our feelings and experiences ( since this is the only other source of information left to us ) . How can you then convince somebody that your `` feelings and experiences '' are the correct ones then if you ca n't show somebody visible and measurable effects ? If my experiences say that `` there exists no god '' and yours says there does , where does that leave us ? Since we are only going on experiences , then both of us are correct within our own personal realities . Furthermore , the trouble with `` feelings and experiences '' is that they can lead you astray , as the tragic outcome of Waco illustrates . I am sure that many of Koresh 's followers really believed in him but I think that you and I will agree that they were being misled . Finally , how on earth do you come to the conclusion that the physical sphere is not self-explanatory when you only rely on the five senses ? > Christians claim that they have received a different kind of evidence , > which they call faith , and which is a gift of God .

You must be using a definition of `` evidence '' that I am not familiar with . To me , evidence is something you can show others -unambiguously- that what you are saying is true . However , I agree with you that belief in a diety is a matter of faith . It is not something you can share around - others must experience it independantly . Unfortunately , as I have explained above , this puts belief down to a matter of experience . My impression is that Christians do not have the monopoly on reason , evidence and faith as far as any of these things can go . > In a previous article , phs431d @ vaxc.cc.monash.edu.au ( ) says : > > > You are right that science and reason can not PROVE anything .

Science claims , with good reason , to be > the most valid system for explaining the physical universe , and Christianity > claims , also with good reason , to be the most valid system , possessed of the > best evidence , for explaining Gods revelations of himself to man . At the risk of repeating my argument : As I have explained previously , the trouble is that Moslems , Buddhists , Jews , etc will ALL say that THEY claim , with good reason , to be a valid system , possessed of the best evidence , for explaining Gods revelations to man ( for Buddhists it should read `` for explaining the non-existence of God '' ) . So not only must you `` prove '' your own case , you have to `` disprove '' theirs . ( alt.messianic is a good place to see people strong in the belief of their own faiths ... and with their own good reasons ) > If you doubt that Christians use reason , read this newsgroup for a while > and you will see rational debate aplenty . I know that ALL people can use reason ... I never claimed that they do n't . I just wish to make sure that their arguments are well-founded . It goes without saying that if I make a blunder that I expect people to correct me .

From : koontzd @ phobos.lrmsc.loral.com ( David Koontz ) Subject : Spoofing Clipper Serial Number Distribution : usa Organization : Loral Rolm Mil-Spec Computers Lines : 35 Secrecy in Clipper Chip The serial number of the clipper chip is encrypted with the system key and transmitted as one part of a three part message . Presumably the protocol can be recovered ( if by nothing else , differential analysis ) . Postulate if you will , a chip ( or logic ) sitting between the clipper chip and its communications channel . The purpose of this chip is twofold : 1 ) Transmit Channel The spoof chip XORs the 30 bit encrypted serial number with a secondary keying variable . This renders the serial number unrecoverable with just the system key 2 ) Recieve Channel The spoof chip XORs the incoming encrypted serial number with a secondary keying variable ( assuming the serial number is necessary for local operation ) . This has the net result of hiding the serial number . This gets more interesting when the number of serial numbers issued becomes large , making it difficult to distinguish between valid serial numbers and a spoofed serial number . Without knowing the system key , you could lie about the serial number , but risk detection of the lie . IF you had the system key and the encryption algorithm you could successfully lie with a lower probability of detection by emulating the format of your own serial number . Makes you wonder whats being hidden here ? Seems like the secrecy is to prevent you from lying about who you are .

The two are not the same , as I pointed out above . There are significant difference between making rules for *use on public property* and *making rules for ownership* . The other half of the objection is trust . Similar things to this have been tried in many local jurisdications across the country , and have been abused in far too many cases . Safety classes which are never sheduled , never funded , or only one or two is held a year for a limited number of participants . Registration lists in New York , Chicago , and California have been used for confiscation . *Many* gun owners would , in theory , support these planes . ( Although the numbers overwhelmingly show that competence is not the problem , that intentional misuse is ) . They 've simply seen it abused and are leery of the next person who comes down the pike with a `` reasonable '' suggestion they 've already seen abused . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- David Veal Univ . of Tenn.

I a single drive environment the drive is described as a Master . In a dual drive environment the drives are described as a Master and a Slave . This is due to the protocal the takes place between the two drives when performing diagnostics . There are four links , LK1 , LK2 , LK4 and LK5 , adjacent to the 40 way interface connector . They have the following functions and are described in order as viewed from the end of the drive , with the first jumper described nearest the 40 way interface connector . LK2 : LED When fitted , this jumper connects the LED drive to pin 39 of the interface . This allows a LED to be connected to the interface . An external current limiting resistor needs to be fitted in series with the LED when this option is selected . The value of the resistor will be dependant on the LED type chosen but will be in the range of 130 Ohms ot 220 Ohms . LK1 : Dual Drives This jumper must be fitted when two drives are attached to a single bus . It fallows communication across the 40 way interface connector , indicating , to the Master drive , the presence of a Slave . LK4 : Master When fitted this signifies that the drive jumpered is a Master . If there are two drives connected on a single bus then only one may be jumpered in this way . LK5 : IOChRdy When fitted this connects the IOChRdy signal to the drive , it is fitted when the drive is used in host systems that have a higher data transfer rate than the drive i.e . greater than 4 MBytes per second when using 1:1 interleave . This jumper is not normally fitted as most hosts transfer at a lower rate than 4 MBytes per second . There are four possible Master/Slave configurations in which a drive ( s ) may be jumpered : Master , single drive with LED on interface LK2 & LK4 fitted . Master , single drive without LED on interface LK4 only fitted . Master , dual drive without LED on interface LK4 & LK1 fitted . Slave , dual drive without LED on interface No jumpers fitted . Master , dual drive with LED on interface LK4 , LK1 & LK2 fitted . Slave , dual drive with LED on interface LK2 only fitted . The Master drive will delay power-up for approximately two seconds to reduce power surges in applications where dual drives are used . The other connections for a LED will be found close to the 28 way connector at the other end of the drive . This LED driver is not affected by the link options . An internal current limiting resistor is on the drive for this LED driver .

Were the two tapes that it unwound of the same type from the same batch ? The reason I ask is that I bought some generic tapes that did this and found that the tape markers were not fully punched out and had closed the little marker hole . It was only on a few tapes of a set . Did you open up the tape cartridge and put the tape back on the reels ? If you have not yet , open it up by removing the two screws on the bottom of the tape cartridge and snap the plastic shell away from the metal base . As you are pulling the tape through the assembly try not to touch any more than you have to . As you are doing it , look for a couple of little holes in the tape . These are the marker holes which let the tape drive know when it is at the end of the tape . The holes are spaced a couple of inches apart . My best guess is that the drive finds the first marker and then stops on the second marker ? Anyhow , If the tape has the holes , then check to see if the mirror on the tape is clean . The function of the mirror is to detect the marker holes . The tape drive shines a light at the mirror and has a pickup in the area where the reflection would come out . When the hole goes by , the pickup detects the light that was allowed to pass and it knows when to stop . If the mirror is dirty or out of alighment ( unlikely since it is made into the case ) you might have a problem detecting the end of the tape . If the tape drive does it on all tapes and the tapes all look good , then either the pickup or the LED of the sensor system has failed or is dirty . If you open the drive door you will see the sensor assembly to the left of the R/W head assembly . If it looks clean and nothing is in its way , then the drive may need to be serviced . It is possible that the LED is burned out or the sensor is out . If it is still in warranty , you might be able to send it back to CMS for repair . -- - Scott Hiles whiles @ relay.nswc.navy.mil Standard disclaimer : The opinions expressed are those of my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the DOD or the Navy .

Just for the hell of it , let 's destroy this remark . Let us imagine that the executive branch actually could extract keys from the escrow houses without anyone knowing , or telling . Now what ? Dick has 80 bits of data . What the hell 's he gon na do with it ? 1 ) Trot around to the telco and say 'we 'd like an unauthorised decrypting tap ' .

Goodness , wait 'til the washington post gets hold of this ) and decrypt the noise . 3 ) More likely , stare at the key , and say 'Oh , hell it 's not worth all this bloody hassle' Truth is , even granted *lots* of covert power on the part of the Executive Branch , this system is *more* difficult to tap with than POTS gear . The fact that it is easier to tap than some hypothetical system neither you nor I am going to place on our phones is neither here nor there . The only rational concerns I am seeing raised are : a ) is the key really just chopped in half , and not some XOR arrangement ?

From : mmm @ cup.portal.com ( Mark Robert Thorson ) Subject : Re : Barbecued foods and health risk Organization : The Portal System ( TM ) Lines : 72 This reminds me of the last Graham Kerr cooking show I saw . Today he smoked meat on the stovetop in a big pot ! He used a strange technique I 'd never seen before . He took a big pot with lid , and placed a tray in it made from aluminum foil . The tray was about the size and shape of a typical coffee-table ash tray , made by crumpling a sheet of foil around the edges . In the tray , he placed a couple spoonfuls of brown sugar , a similar quantity of brown rice ( he said any rice will do ) , the contents of two teabags of Earl Grey tea , and a few cloves . On top of this was placed an ordinary aluminum basket-type steamer , with two chicken breasts in it . The lid was put on , and the whole assembly went on the stovetop at high heat for 10 or 12 minutes . Later , he removed what looked like smoked chicken breasts . What surprises and concerns me are : 1 ) No wood chips . Where does the smoke flavor come from ? 2 ) About 5 or 10 years ago , I remember hearing that carmel color ( obtained by caramelizing sugar -- a common coloring and flavoring agent ) had been found to be carcinogenic . I believe they injected it under the skin of rats , or something . If the results were conclusive , caramel color would not be legal in the U.S. , yet it is still being used . Was the initial research result found to be incorrect , or what ? 3 ) About 5 or 10 years ago , I remember Earl Grey tea being implicated as carcinogenic , because it contains oil of bergamot ( an extract from the skin of a type of citrus fruit ) . Does anyone know whatever happened with that story ? If it were carcinogenic , Earl Grey tea could not have it as an additive , yet it apparently continues to do so . WRT natural wood smoke ( I 've smoking a duck right now , as it happens ) , I 've noticed that a heavily-smoked food item will have an unpleasant tangy taste when eaten directly out of the smoker if the smoke has only recently stopped flowing . I find the best taste to be had by using dry wood chips , getting lots of smoke right up at the beginning of the cooking process , then slowly barbequing for hours and hours without adding additional wood chips . My theory is that the unpleasant tangy molecules are low-molecular weight stuff , like terpenes , and that the smoky flavor molecules are some sort of larger molecule more similar to tar . The long barbeque time after the initial intensive smoke drives off the low-molecular weight stuff , just leaving the flavor behind . Does anyone know if my theory is correct ? I also remember hearing that the combustion products of fat dripping on the charcoal and burning are carcinogenic . For that reason , and because it covers the product with soot and some unpleasant tanginess , I only grill non-drippy meats like prawns directly over hot coals . I do stuff like this duck by indirect heat . I have a long rectangular Weber , and I put the coals at one end and the meat at the other end . The fat drops directly on the floor below the meat , and next time I use the barbeque I make the fire in that end to burn off the fat and help ignite the coals . And yet another reason I 've heard not to smoke or barbeque meat is that smoked cured meat , like pork sausage and bacon , contains nitrosamines , which are carcinogenic . I 'm pretty sure this claim actually has some standing , do n't know about the others . An amusing incident I recall was the Duncan Hines scandal , when it was discovered that the people who make Duncan Hines cake mix were putting a lot of ethylene dibromide ( EDB ) into the cake mix to suppress weevils . This is a fumigant which is known to be carcinogenic . The guy who represented the company in the press conference defended himself by saying that the risk from eating Duncan Hines products every day for a year would be equal to the cancer risk from eating two charcoal- broiled steaks . What a great analogy ! When I first heard that , my immediate reaction was we should make that a standard unit ! One charcoal broiled steak would be equivalent to 0.5 Duncans !

EDGAR PANGBORN '' Davy '' Post atomic doomsday novel set in clerical states . The church , for example , forbids that anyone `` produce , describe or use any substance containing ... atoms '' . PHILIP K. DICK Philip K. Dick Dick wrote many philosophical and thought-provoking short stories and novels . His stories are bizarre at times , but very approachable . He wrote mainly SF , but he wrote about people , truth and religion rather than technology . Although he often believed that he had met some sort of God , he remained sceptical . Amongst his novels , the following are of some relevance : '' Galactic Pot-Healer '' A fallible alien deity summons a group of Earth craftsmen and women to a remote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans . When the deity begins to demand faith from the earthers , pot-healer Joe Fernwright is unable to comply . A polished , ironic and amusing novel . `` A Maze of Death '' Noteworthy for its description of a technology-based religion . `` VALIS '' The schizophrenic hero searches for the hidden mysteries of Gnostic Christianity after reality is fired into his brain by a pink laser beam of unknown but possibly divine origin . He is accompanied by his dogmatic and dismissively atheist friend and assorted other odd characters . `` The Divine Invasion '' God invades Earth by making a young woman pregnant as she returns from another star system . Unfortunately she is terminally ill , and must be assisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to 24-hour easy listening music . MARGARET ATWOOD '' The Handmaid 's Tale '' A story based on the premise that the US Congress is mysteriously assassinated , and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it '' right '' again . The book is the diary of a woman 's life as she tries to live under the new Christian theocracy . Women 's right to own property is revoked , and their bank accounts are closed ; sinful luxuries are outlawed , and the radio is only used for readings from the Bible . Crimes are punished retroactively : doctors who performed legal abortions in the `` old world '' are hunted down and hanged . Atwood 's writing style is difficult to get used to at first , but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on . VARIOUS AUTHORS '' The Bible '' This somewhat dull and rambling work has often been criticized . However , it is probably worth reading , if only so that you 'll know what all the fuss is about . It exists in many different versions , so make sure you get the one true version . Books -- Non-fiction PETER DE ROSA '' Vicars of Christ '' , Bantam Press , 1988 Although de Rosa seems to be Christian or even Catholic this is a very enlighting history of papal immoralities , adulteries , fallacies etc . ( German translation : `` Gottes erste Diener . Die dunkle Seite des Papsttums '' , Droemer-Knaur , 1989 ) MICHAEL MARTIN '' Atheism : A Philosophical Justification '' , Temple University Press , Philadelphia , USA . A detailed and scholarly justification of atheism . Contains an outstanding appendix defining terminology and usage in this ( necessarily ) tendentious area . Argues both for `` negative atheism '' ( i.e . the `` non-belief in the existence of god ( s ) '' ) and also for `` positive atheism '' ( `` the belief in the non-existence of god ( s ) '' ) . Includes great refutations of the most challenging arguments for god ; particular attention is paid to refuting contempory theists such as Platinga and Swinburne . 541 pages . ISBN 0-87722-642-3 ( hardcover ; paperback also available ) '' The Case Against Christianity '' , Temple University Press A comprehensive critique of Christianity , in which he considers the best contemporary defences of Christianity and ( ultimately ) demonstrates that they are unsupportable and/or incoherent . 273 pages .

Examines the way in which unbelief ( whether agnostic or atheistic ) became a mainstream alternative world-view . Focusses on the period 1770-1900 , and while considering France and Britain the emphasis is on American , and particularly New England developments . `` Neither a religious history of secularization or atheism , Without God , Without Creed is , rather , the intellectual history of the fate of a single idea , the belief that God exists .

Includes obscure ( and often suppressed ) opinions from many people . For some popular observations , traces the way in which various people expressed and twisted the idea over the centuries . Quite a number of the quotations are derived from Cardiff 's `` What Great Men Think of Religion '' and Noyes ' `` Views of Religion '' . 490 pages . ISBN ( paper ) 0-345-29887-X . RICHARD SWINBURNE '' The Existence of God ( Revised Edition ) '' , Clarendon Paperbacks , Oxford This book is the second volume in a trilogy that began with `` The Coherence of Theism '' ( 1977 ) and was concluded with `` Faith and Reason '' ( 1981 ) . In this work , Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the existence of God . His arguments , which are somewhat tendentious and rely upon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values and aesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived , were decisively rejected in Mackie 's `` The Miracle of Theism '' . In the revised edition of `` The Existence of God '' , Swinburne includes an Appendix in which he makes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut Mackie . J. L. MACKIE '' The Miracle of Theism '' , Oxford This ( posthumous ) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal arguments for and against the existence of God . It ranges from the classical philosophical positions of Descartes , Anselm , Berkeley , Hume et al , through the moral arguments of Newman , Kant and Sidgwick , to the recent restatements of the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne . It also addresses those positions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational , such as those of Kierkegaard , Kung and Philips , as well as `` replacements for God '' such as Lelie 's axiarchism . The book is a delight to read - less formalistic and better written than Martin 's works , and refreshingly direct when compared with the hand-waving of Swinburne . JAMES A.

How about : The Holocaust The Spanish Inquisition Jonestown ( just to name a few ) ? Authorities sometimes tell people to do evil things . People who `` just follow orders '' have tortured and killed others in very large numbers , and protest their innocence afterwards . When your authority starts telling you to do things , you should ask questions . Except for situations of pressing need ( `` I said shut the hatch because the submarine is filling with water ! `` ) , any reasonable authority should be able to give at least some justification that you can understand . Just be sure to listen when authority answers . ( If anybody is interested in questions of psychological pressure and following orders , you might want to read about a study done by Solomon Ashe in 1951 on conformity , and another done by Stanley Milgram in 1963 on obedience . Both should be in any good book on psychology/sociology .

CRITZ , III '' < 71611.365 @ CompuServe.COM > Subject : EnviroLeague '' Birth Announcement '' on March 7 , 1993 , from EARTH Forum , CompuServe Information Service =================================================================== FORMAL ANNOUNCEMENT -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - ( SM ) EnviroLeague A new youth movement , '' EnviroLeague , '' was recently born , according to its founder , Boyd R. Critz , III ( CIS ID # 71611,365 ) , of Peoria , Illinois . EnviroLeague exists for the education of youth , both male and female , in matters concerning their values related to and responsibility for our environment . Incorporated as an Illinois not-for-profit corporation , its Articles and initial applications for a service mark have now been filed . According to Critz , its draft Bylaws contain the following statement of Mission and Objectives : MISSION It is the Mission of EnviroLeague and its adult members to foster and implement the improved education of young people in the need to conduct their lives as Stewards of The Earth , to leave The Earth in a better condition than they found it , and to otherwise act as responsible , moral and ethical users of their environment . To pursue the accomplishment of this Mission , EnviroLeague shall seek to serve as a catalyst , focusing in common cause the separate efforts of all groups desiring the preservation , improvement , and responsible use of the environment in which we must all live . OBJECTIVES In pursuit of the Mission of EnviroLeague , its primary objectives shall be : ( 1 ) To establish a Movement involving as many environmentally concerned organizations as possible , said Movement having as its primary focus the education and participatory involvement of young people in appropriate areas of environmental concern ; ( 2 ) To develop and provide to such organizations and their branches a full complement of program materials for their use , including suitable uniforms , insignia and other badges , written ideas , syllabi and information , literature and other items as shall seem appropriate and desirable ; ( 3 ) To serve as a `` clearing house '' for the exchange of program ideas , materials and information among said organizations ; and ( 4 ) To assist environmentally concerned organizations to recruit and train the necessary adult leadership for their youth programs . EnviroLeague will operate through three `` Program Divisions '' serving youth in the elementary , middle and high school grades , respectively . Service shall be through formation of `` EnviroLeague Teams , '' either by EnviroLeague itself or by environmentally conscious organizations ( or their local branches ) wishing a charter to use programs developed by EnviroLeague . EnviroLeague , as it develops , will be controlled by the actual adult leaders of each local Team , and will have no nationally imposed obstacles to membership or adult leadership status not based upon relevant improper conduct . Organizations accepting a charter may , however , impose certain additional standards for their own use of the program material . Should such organizations do so , EnviroLeague will commit itself to forming , as soon as possible , new nearby Teams having no such restrictions , particularly as to youth membership . EnviroLeague will operate on the principle that youth will have much to contribute to developing its programs . Thus , the top youth leaders of its Teams for middle and high school youth may become involved in governing any local administrative groups , and those for its high school youth may be involved in similar functions at the national level . Program materials are in development at this time . Copies of the `` draft '' portions of the Mentor 's Manual ( manual for adult leadership ) will be in the EARTH Forum , Library 17 . These files will be updated as development takes place . CompuServe is particularly proud that EnviroLeague 's founder chose this electronic medium to make the first public announcement of its formation . This announcement is being made simultaneously in both the OUTDOOR and EARTH Forums . The electronic home of EnviroLeague is in CompuServe 's Earth Forum - GO EARTH - message and library areas 17 , both named `` EnviroLeague . '' ============================================================================ Subsequently , EnviroLeague 's Initial Governance Council has held its first meeting . Boyd Critz was elected as the first EnviroLeague Chief Guardian ( equivalent to Chairman of the Board or CEO ) . He can be reached at home ( 309 ) 675-4483 in case of real need . Also , mail can be addressed to : EnviroLeague P.O . Box 418 Peoria , IL 61651-0418 Those interested in starting an EnviroLeague Team might just establish contact , to receive a diskette ( IBM DOS , ASCII ) with initial information . -- cdt @ rocket.sw.stratus.com -- If you believe that I speak for my company , OR cdt @ vos.stratus.com write today for my special Investors ' Packet ...

Of course He hears all your prayers . Whether you are a sinner or a saint , no questions . The real question you should be asking is : `` Does sin block OUR hearing His answer ?

This is stated as a fact without supporting evidence . It would've been more convincing if your reporter had come up with just one name of someone who is sitting in jail , lost to the world , as he suggests . Maybe Elvis , or JFK , somebody . Let 's put it this way : If Israel has put people away without publicizing their arrests or the legal proceedings against them , how has their disappearance been explained ? People have relatives , friends and colleagues , you know . Israel is not known as a place where people are made to vanish . Would you care to give us a list of people whose whereabouts are unknown ? People who are presumed to be imprisoned ? This whole conspiracy story is n't something that we've come to associate with Yigal Arens before .

I 've wanted to own a 914 for about 10 years now ; came close once but I ended up buying a Fiero instead ( biggest mistake of my life ! ) Anyway , for $ 4000 you should be able to get a nice car but your also set in the price range to get taken by a nice looker that is a pile of shit . The most common total failure for the car would be frame rust between the engine and passenger compartment . Also look for chassis welded together here . Oh yeah , the price range you are talking about must be the 4 banger ; a 6 ( if you could find one ) would be mucho more bucks . Parts for the engine are pretty easy to come by ( for an old car ) and you can even locate crude in the JC Whitney catalog if you have too . The machine itself is pretty simple ( they use the spare tire for windshild washer instead of a pump fer chris sake ! ) so getting it fixed by a good bug/porsche mechanic would be easy .

I have the local bus card also , and do n't have any such problems with it now , but this is the second card I 've gotten - the first card did n't work in VGA mode correctly .

The HGA is n't all that reflective in the wavelengths that might `` cook the focal elements '' , nor is its figure good on those scales -- the problem is that the antenna _itself_ could not be exposed to Venus-level sunlight , lest like Icarus ' wings it melt . ( I think it was glues and such , as well as electronics , that they were worried about . ) Thus it had to remain furled and the axis _always_ pointed near the sun , so that the small sunshade at the tip of the antenna mast would shadow the folded HGA .

All of this is fine . I never said that Murray was a bad GM . I merely said that he is n't the best GM in hockey- or even a contender for that honor . If Murray is as great as you claim- the Wings would have won the Stanley Cup by now- probably more than once . If he was as great a GM as you claim and he was as poor a coach as you claim- he would have been intelligent enough to hire the coach to push the team to the next level of success . But Murray is an average ( unspectacular ) NHL coach and a pretty good GM so none of this is true anyway . Gregmeister

Apple has really confused people with this whole thing . I think we 'll be answering this question for about the next year or so . There is no `` option '' to get an FPU on a C650 . What you have is a choice of CPUs : there is the 68LC040 that does not have an integrated FPU like the full '040 and is only present in the base 4/80 model of the C650 ( AppleUSA ) . And there is the full '040 which you get when you order anything other than the base 4/80 configuration . Therefore , since you have ordered one of the 8MB versions with on-board Ethernet models you will not be getting the LC040 . But even if you wanted to have the LC040 you wouldn't be able to order a C650 with 8MB RAM , on-board Ethernet and an LC040 . It 's not an `` option . '' Also , a note to people out there that have 4/80 C650s and C610s thinking that there is an optional FPU , the '040 class chip can not recognize an external FPU , so there is no socket on the motherboard for a FPU chip and you can not go out and purchase an FPU on a PDS card or something like that . The only way to get an FPU in these machines is to replace the LC040 with a full '040 . And if you have a C610 , you will not need to worry about a heat sink if you do replace the LC040 with the full '040 , but if you have a 4/80 C650 you do need to have a heat sink . -Hades

After reading some of the reports of possible NHL moves to Milwaukee or that Milwaukee should have an NHL team , I thought I 'd pass along a story I heard recently . This is second hand , so I do n't know how true it is , but I have no reason to doubt it either . Bradley Center in Milwaukee is home to the Milwaukee Admirals minor leauge hockey team . The owner of the Admirals ( sorry , I ca n't remember his name ) either owns or at least shelled out the majority of the funds to build the Bradley Center . Supposedly he was approached by the NHL about an expansion franchise , but turned it down because he thought the franchise fee of $ 50 million was too high . Like I said , I do n't know whether this story is true or just a rumor , but if it 's true , do n't look for an NHL team in Milwaukee anytime soon . The Admirals are n't going to be forced out of the building and you wo n't see an NHL club and a minor league club in the same building , especially since the NBA's Milwaukee Bucks play there as well .

Greeks , Armenians , Kurds ( I must say Turk-Kurd relations are improving slightly with time ) and not pose a threat to Turkey 's neighbours . The Turks blatantly rejected this treaty ( the Germans grudgingly accepted Versailles which was a million times worse for the health and pride of the German people ) .The Greeks who had an army there , were there with BRITISH and FRENCH backing to enforce Sevres . In possibly the first example of appeasement the Young Turk government managed screwed the Treaty of Laussane out of the weak allies , this was after the Greek forces were were destroyed at Smyrna.When this occurred incidently , FRENCH warships were in the harbour and many Greeks trying escape swam to the FRENCH warships and climbed aboard only to get their arms cut off by the FRENCH as they clawed they 're way up the sides of the ships .

I do n't know if this is believeing blindly or not . I 'm not sure how blindness comes into it . I do not deny reason , indeed I insist upon it , but reason only draws conclusions from evidence . If you decide in advance that your reason will act only on the evidence of the five physical senses , then you cut reason off from any possibility of reaching a conclusion outside the physical sphere ( beyond the rather provocative , if inconclusive , conclusion that the physical sphere is not self explanatory ) . Christians claim that they have received a different kind of evidence , which they call faith , and which is a gift of God . That is , this evidence is the evidence of a thing which chooses to reveal or hide itself . The evidence of the senses can not tell you is such a ting exists . Reasoning on the evidence of the senses wo n't help either . But Christians do reason of the evidence of faith , and do claim that this evidence is wholly consistent with the evidence of the other senses , and indeed , that the evidence of these other senses is part of God 's revelation of himself to us . It is not necessarilly the case however that knowledge of a God must come through this route . There may be other senses than the physical ones providing evidence of non-physical realities . ( There may , of course , be physical realities of a type for which we have no corresponding senses , for all we know . ) These senses , if they exist , may provide valid evidence for reason to work on . And , as with all senses , these senses may be impaired in some people , that is , they may be spiritually blind . In this sense , belief in God becomes an act of sight , and it is disbelief which is blind . > You are right that science and reason can not PROVE anything . However , if > we do not use them we can only then believe on FAITH alone . And since > we can only use faith , why is one picture of `` God '' ( e.g . Hinduism ) any less > valid than another ( e.g . Christianity ) ? > Faith , as I have said , is not opposed to reason , it is simply a new source of evidence on which reason may operate . It is clear that human beings have many systems for explaining the evidence of the physical senses , and similarly there are many systems for explaining the evidence provided by faith . Religious believers in general , and Christians in particular , use reason to help sift through the evidence to come to a clearer understanding of the evidence provided by faith . Science claims , with good reason , to be the most valid system for explaining the physical universe , and Christianity claims , also with good reason , to be the most valid system , possessed of the best evidence , for explaining Gods revelations of himself to man . If you doubt that Christians use reason , read this newsgroup for a while and you will see rational debate aplenty . -- ============================================================================== Mark Baker | `` The task ... is not to cut down jungles , but aa888 @ Freenet.carleton.ca | to irrigate deserts .

What we want to know is if there is some sort of hardware that will route telnet sessions from the Localtalk Macs to the NeXT via the Ethernet Mac . From what we have heard , AIR does n't do the trick . Software solutions would be good too , but my impression is that there are n't going to be any . Our immediate interest is to be able to get to the NeXT and telnet out again .

It is disingeneous to compare their death to that of athletes in Munich or any other act of terrorism or mrder . This exercise is aimed solely at diverting the issue and is far from the truth . I agree that the death of three soldiers on a patrol etc ... is not terrorism . That having been said , lets continue . [ snip ] imagine ? ? ? ? It is NOT a `` terrorist camp '' as you and the Israelis like to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer in the streets , women preparing lunch , men playing cards , etc ... .. I would not argue that all or even most of the villages are `` terrorist camps '' . There are however some which come very close to serving that purpose and that is not to say that other did not function in that way prior to the invasion . SOME young men , usually aged between 17 to 30 years are members of the Lebanese resistance . Even the inhabitants of the village do not know who these are , they are secretive about it , but most people often suspect who they are and what they are up to . These young men are supported financially by Iran most of the time . They sneak arms and ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps for Israeli patrols . Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injured by these traps , Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians . Once they are back they announce that they bombed a `` terrorist hideout '' where an 8 year old girl just happened to be . Some of the villages , and yours might well be among them , are as you describe . Not all are . There are a large number of groups in the area , backed by various organizations , with a wide range of purposes . Hizbollah and Amal were two of the larger ones and may still be . As to retaliation , while mistakes may be made , that is still a far cry from indiscriminate bombing , which would have produced major casualties . Israel 's retalliation policy is cold hearted , but a reality that we have come to accept and deal with , the Lebanese Resistance on the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on OCCUPYING ISRAELI SOLDIERS until they withdraw , this is the only real leverage that they have to force Israel to withdraw . Well , here we disagree . I think that Israel would willingly withdraw if the Lebanese gov't was able to field a reliable force in the area to police it and prevent further attacks . This is the only realistic solution , it is time for Israel to realize that the concept of a `` buffer zone '' aimed at protecting its northern cities has failed . In fact it has caused much more Israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israel would have resulted in . Actually that is not clear at all . I will agree that the death toll is no longer civilian and now primarily military though . There seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese goovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such circumstances , and now the Lebanese government has proven that it is capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did in all other parts of Lebanon . No , the Syrian gov't is more than happy to have Israel sink into another Lebanese morass . I could elaborate if necessary . I agree , only in the case of the Isareli soldiers their killing CAN NOT be qualified as murder , no matter what you say . No , but it is regretable , as is the whole situation . -- Shai Guday | Stealth bombers , OS Software Engineer | Thinking Machines Corp. | the winged ninjas of the skies . Cambridge , MA |

As I understand most people selling things over the net do not grant a warranty , I am in such a situation that the seller did not state whether a warranty would be granted or not and the item I received is out of order . The seller insisted that it was 'in good condition ' when he sent it and so would just return half ofthe amount that I paid if I send the item back to him and after he is sured it is bad .

Mind you , I do n't think EEG is terribly sensitive for brain tumor , but the patient feels like `` something is being done '' ( as if the hours I spent talking with and examining the patient were '' nothing '' ) , the EEG has no ionizing radiation , it 's *much* cheaper than CT or MRI , and the EEG brings in some money to my department . -- - .

They were attacking the Iraqis to drive them out of Kuwait , a country whose citizens have close blood and business ties to Saudi citizens .

You make it sound like these guys are angels , Ilyess . ( In your clarinet posting you edited out some stuff ; was it the following ? ? ? ) Friday 's New York Times reported that this group definitely is more conservative than even Sheikh Baz and his followers ( who think that the House of Saud does not rule the country conservatively enough ) . The NYT reported that , besides complaining that the government was not conservative enough , they have : - asserted that the ( approx . 500,000 ) Shiites in the Kingdom are apostates , a charge that under Saudi ( and Islamic ) law brings the death penalty . Diplomatic guy ( Sheikh bin Jibrin ) , is n't he Ilyess ? - called for severe punishment of the 40 or so women who drove in public a while back to protest the ban on women driving . The guy from the group who said this , Abdelhamoud al-Toweijri , said that these women should be fired from their jobs , jailed , and branded as prostitutes . Is this what you want to see happen , Ilyess ? I've heard many Muslims say that the ban on women driving has no basis in the Qur'an , the ahadith , etc . Yet these folks not only like the ban , they want these women falsely called prostitutes ? If I were you , I 'd choose my heroes wisely , Ilyess , not just reflexively rally behind anyone who hates anyone you hate . - say that women should not be allowed to work . - say that TV and radio are too immoral in the Kingdom . Now , the House of Saud is neither my least nor my most favorite government on earth ; I think they restrict religious and political reedom a lot , among other things . I just think that the most likely replacements for them are going to be a lot worse for the citizens of the country . But I think the House of Saud is feeling the heat lately . In the last six months or so I 've read there have been stepped up harassing by the muttawain ( religious police -- -*not* government ) of Western women not fully veiled ( something stupid for women to do , IMO , because it sends the wrong signals about your morality ) . And I 've read that they 've cracked down on the few , home-based expartiate religious gatherings , and even posted rewards in ( government-owned ) newspapers offering money for anyone who turns in a group of expartiates who dare worship in their homes or any other secret place . So the government has grown even more intolerant to try to take some of the wind out of the sails of the more-conservative opposition . As unislamic as some of these things are , they 're just a small taste of what would happen if these guys overthrow the House of Saud , like they 're trying to in the long run . Is this really what you ( and Rached and others in the general west-is-evil-zionists-rule-hate-west-or-you-are-a-puppet crowd ) want , Ilyess ? -- Dave Bakken == > '' the President is doing a fine job , but the problem is we do n't know what to do with her husband .

I think `` The Yeast Connection '' is > a bunch of hooey . What does this have to do with how well > nutrition is taught , anyway ? Elisabeth , let 's set the record straight for the nth time , I have not read '' The Yeast Connection '' . So anything that I say is not due to brainwashing by this `` hated '' book . It 's okay I guess to hate the book , by why hate me ? Elisabeth , I 'm going to quote from Zinsser 's Microbiology , 20th Edition . A book that you should be familiar with and not `` hate '' . `` Candida species colonize the mucosal surfaces of all humans during birth or shortly thereafter . The risk of endogenous infection is clearly ever present . Indeed , candidiasis occurs worldwide and is the most common systemic mycosis . '' Neutrophils play the main role in preventing a systemic infection ( candidiasis ) so you would have to have a low neutrophil count or '' sick '' neutrophils to see a systemic infection . Poor diet and persistent parasitic infestation set many third world residents up for candidiasis . Your assessment of candidiasis in the U.S. is correct and I do not dispute it . What I posted was a discussion of candida blooms , without systemic infection . These blooms would be responsible for local sites of irritation ( GI tract , mouth , vagina and sinus cavity ) . Knocking down the bacterial competition for candida was proposed as a possible trigger for candida blooms . Let me quote from Zinsser 's again : `` However , some factors , such as the use of a broad-spectrum antibacterial antibiotic , may predispose to both mucosal and systemic infections '' . I was addressing mucosal infections ( I like the term blooms better ) . The nutrition course that I teach covers this effect of antibiotic treatment as well as the `` cure '' . I guess that your nutrition course does not , too bad . > > Here is a brief primer on yeast . Yeast infections , as they are commonly > > called , are not truely caused by yeasts .

( shudder ) > Or maybe you did know , and were oversimplifying ? My , my Elisabeth , do I detect a little of Steve Dyer in you ? If you noticed my faculty rank , I 'm a biochemist , not a microbiologist . Candida is classifed as a fungus ( according to Zinsser 's ) . But , as you point out , it displays dimorphism . It is capable of producing yeast cells , pseudohyphae and true hyphae . Elisabeth , you are probably a microbiologist and that makes a lot of sense to you . To a biochemist , it 's a lot of Greek . So I called it a yeast-like fungus , go ahead and crucify me . You know Elisabeth , I still have n't been able to figure out why such a small little organism like Candida can bring out so much hostility in people in Sci . Med . And I must admitt that I got sucked into the mud slinging too . I keep hoping that if people will just take the time to think about what I 've said , that it will make sense . I 'm not asking anyone here to buy into '' The Yeast Connection '' book because I do n't know what 's in that book , plain and simple .

Here we have the irreconcilable difference : Christians glorify exactly what we tend to despise or snub : trust/belief/faith without knowledge . If I am lucky one day and I happen to be thinking of God at the same time my enkephalins go up , then I may associate this as a sign of God ( it will `` feel '' right , and I will trust without knowing ) . Maybe . Religosity does not seem to be anything that is conclusively arrived at , but rather it seems to be more of a sudden affliction ... I believe many of us were willing to die for what we believed , many of us were not . The question is , is suchg an attitude reflective of a _correct_ or healthy morality . IT would seem not to be . The same thing could reflect fanaticism , for example , and is any case an expression of simple selfishness . -- -- Adam ================================================================================ | Adam John Cooper | '' Verily , often have I laughed at the weaklings | | ( 612 ) 696-7521 | who thought themselves good simply because | | acooper @ macalstr.edu | they had no claws .

Answer : The EISA bus does move 32 bits rather than ISA 's 8/ ( 16 ? ) But it still moves it at about the speed as the ISA bus . I think that 's either 8 or 10 mhz . The local bus designs also move 32 bits like the EISA , but they move the data at the cpu speed , up to 40 mhz . So , on a 33mhz cpu , the local bus is moving 32bit data at 33 mhz , and the EISA is moving 32bit data at 8 or 10 mhz . So the local bus should be 3 to 4 times faster than EISA on a 33 mhz cpu . EISA should be about two ( maybe 3 ) times as fast as ISA . > Since they are not , why would anyone ( me included ) pay a higher > cost for a EISA video card when its performance is no better than > and often worse that a much cheaper ISA video board , such as a > Diamond SpeedStar 24X ?

The EISA bus does have more advantages over the ISA bus than just it 's width . For example : more/better interrupts and bus mastering . But these other factors do not impact a video card very much .

From : Matjaz.Gams @ IJS.si Subject : `` Call for Papers for INFORMATIKA '' Vol . 17 No . 2 Originator : abrodnik @ watdragon.uwaterloo.ca Organization : Jozef Stefan Institute , Ljubljana , Slovenia Lines : 69 This is an invitation to send articles to the Informatica magazine . The first fully international issue has been published and echoes are quite favourable . For any information , contact ( matjaz.gams @ ijs.si ) . Dear Colleague , April 25 , 1993 Number 1 of volume 17 of Informatica is now out of print and some of you will receive it in a week or so . As you will see , the journal is structured in the following way : the editorial ( first page ) ; profiles ( second page -- biography of an editor , in this issue , Terry Winograd ) ; the edited part of papers ( pp . 3-80 ) ; mission and research reports ( A plan for knowledge archives project in Japan and CSLI in Stanford , pp . 81-100 ) ; and news and announcements ( pp . 101-108 ) . This structure is mentioned to give you a suggestion how could you help to make the contents of the journal significant , diverse , and interesting , bringing your own views into the discourse . A great emphasis is given to the so-called editorial page . This page expresses an opinion ( belief ) of the writing editor to some problems within the scope of computing and informatics , extending into other concerning disciplines , e.g . cybernetics , advanced AI , cognitive sciences , mind , informationally concerned neural sciences , advanced technology ( e.g . photonics ) , etc . I asked professor Terry Winograd to write this page for Number 2 . I certainly would appreciate very much to get suggestions or possible offers from other editors , who like to express their strong ( directed ) beliefs concerning a future development of the area in question . On the second page of each Number an editor 's profile is published . The aim of the profile is twofold : to show his/her professional achievements , interests , scientific , and philosophical orientation on one side ; to narrate his/her life story in the environments in which editors has lived and live on the other side . This kind of story should be instructive , adequately factically faced , contributing to the understanding of circumstances in which editors have to act and live . The edited part ( edited papers ) is still critical . I would like to have a stock of accepted papers in advance , so the issuing dates of a particular number can be fixed ( e.g . January , April , July , and October ) . In situation right now , I ask you to help me with contributions of yours or your colleagues , collaborators , students , etc . Some critical views to the contemporary development of computing and informatics are appreciated . A special emphasis should be given also to originality by which fresh ideas are coming into the circulation of different professional communities . Reports of different occasions ( symposia , conferences , meetings , etc . ) and particularly on new books , papers , and interesting events are welcome . You can send these news immediately ( also by your secretary ) by e-mail . On the other hand , you can send books and other publications ( annual reports , journals , calls for papers , etc . ) for reviewing and publishing in Informatica . We in the editorial staff will manage the rest . E-mail is functioning satisfactorily , so please use it in every respect . You can submit editorial notes , profiles , reports , news and even complete papers written in standard LaTex format ( especially formulas ) . We received several final ( corrected ) texts in Number 1 from different sites ( US , Russia , etc. ) . In this way , you can compose reports from already typed texts , using your own choice and editing , and submit them to the contact person ( matjaz.gams @ ijs.si ) , who is always being on your disposal . So , you will receive a prompt confirmation and any information concerning our common interest and job . At the end , please do not forget : we need your cooperation and help in every mentioned respect . The aim of Informatica is to open various possibilities of communication concerning strong scientific and philosophical orientations as well as those coming up , still unrevealed , and on the way to become significant . Please , do not apprehend to give proposals , suggestions , and , certainly , contributions via the e-mail and by other means . Sincerely yours , Anton P. `` Zeleznikar Editor-in-chief

But it is not > , yes definitely not , an ethinic group . ok ! so , these Bosnian Muslims , who > are they ? to which ethnic group do they belong ? what language ( s ) do they > speak ? do they have a different language from that of the Serbs or Croats ? In Bosnia , `` Muslim '' is not merely a religious category , but an ethnic one as well . Actually , here are the two contradictory arguments made by people on this subject : ( 1 ) There is only Serbian and Croatian nationality , and Bosnian Muslims are simply Croats and Serbs of Islamic faith . ( 2 ) Bosnian Muslims are a separate nationality since they do not feel themselves to be Croats nor Serbs . In 1968 , argument ( 2 ) was accepted by former Yugoslavia as valid , and ( 1 ) was soundly rejected . The reasons are pragmatic : even if Bosnian Muslims are Croats and Serbs who converted to Islam under Turkish rule centuries ago , none of the present generation has any clue what was their ancestor 's actual nationality . In fact , although Bosnian Muslims have felt drawn to Croatian or Serbian national allegiance , most of them feel they have a separate cultural and historic identity . So , arguments like `` yes , but your ancestors were Croats or Serbs '' carry very little weight . Regardless of what their ancestors might have been , as long as Bosnian Muslims feel that they are a separate national group , that ends the debate . What outsiders say is simply not relevant . > the way the western press use the word 'muslim ' in this Bosnian debacle has > kept me wondering when the meaning of muslim/moslem i knew from childhood was > changed in the dictionary . this is just a question . no flames intended ! In the case of former Yugoslavia , the date is 1971 , when `` Muslim nationality '' appeared as a census category for the first time . This was the result of a sequence of decisions over the past decade , from recognizing '' Bosniaks '' as an ethnic group ( 1961 ) to February 1968 resolution ( in B-H ) declaring that Muslims are a separate nation , to formal endorsement of this in January 1969 , and eventually to the 1971 inclusion of '' Muslim nationality '' choice in census forms . For comparison , in 1948 census there were three national categories available to Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina : Serb-Muslims : 71,991 Croat-Muslims : 25,295 Muslims , ethnically undeclared : 788,403 This clearly demonstrates that Muslims feel themselves to be their own nationality . Only a tiny minority felt able to choose Serb or Croat nationality . Census results show that Bosnian Muslims have consistently opted for a third category : in 1948 they chose `` undeclared '' , in 1953 they chose `` Yugoslavs '' , in 1961 both `` Yugoslavs '' and `` Bosniak ethnic group '' , and in 1971 , 1981 and 1991 they chose `` Muslim nationality '' . Perhaps the term `` Bosnian Muslim nationality '' is too confusing for the rest of the world . But , in the present context , we ARE talking about Muslims as nationality ; not as a religous group within some separate national identity . The reasons are mostly historical and cultural . Religion plays a smaller role , as a part of culture in general , because the area is simply not known for religious fanaticism . Political fanaticism , yes ; religious fanaticism , no . Group security and survival dominate people 's thinking ; not fine points of theology . In fact , Bosnia-Herzegovina is as well known for religious tolerance in peacetime as it is known for terrible carnage in wartime . Sincerely , -Josip

It is said that CELP vocoders can run on the highest speed 486s with some room to spare -- they turn 64kbit ( 8 bit samples , 8k samples/sec ) into 4800 baud . However , DSP is hairy , and I have yet to see actual proof of this in the form of an implementation . I have heard fairly reliable rumors to the effect that a famous internetworking guru has a CELP implementation that runs on Sparcstation 1+ 's with some room to spare , but I have not succeeded thus far in getting my hands on a copy -- the guru in question has a reputation for not releasing code without having beaten on it for a very very long time first . DSP experts are heavily encouraged to try their own hand at this problem . -- Perry Metzger pmetzger @ shearson.com -- Laissez faire , laissez passer . Le monde va de lui meme .

From : rmakarem @ usc.edu ( Total Stranger ) Subject : HELP with 89 Mitsubishi Galant GS Transmission Organization : University of Southern California , Los Angeles , CA Lines : 43 Distribution : world NNTP-Posting-Host : phakt.usc.edu Hi , I need your help with a problem I have with a 1989 Mitsubishi Galant GS transmission . The car has a 5 speed manual tranmission . Since the car was bought new , while shifting from 2nd to 3rd , unless I do it SLOWLY and carefully , it makes a `` popping '' or `` hitting '' sound . The dealer and Mitsubishi customer service ( reached by an 800 # ) say this is NORMAL for the car . IS IT ? And about a year ago , at 35Kmiles , the stick shift handle got STUCK while attempting to put it in reverse : 1- The shifter would not budge . The clutch had no effect . 2- The front tires would not budge , even when the clutch is fully depressed . 3- If the clutch is released the engine would die . 4- Assuming that some gear was engaged while the shifter was stuck , I could not make the car move . It acted as if it were in Neutral ( except for dying when clutch is released . ) 5- I finally was able to release the shifter by having someone rock the car back and forth ( less than an inch ) , while I depressed the clutch and jiggled the shifter . 6- The shifter acted normally after that . When this happened , I took it to the dealer , they checked the clutch , it was o.k . They checked the transmission , it was o.k . I had the exact problem a couple of months ago , and again last week . The dealer says there is nothing they can do because Mitsubishi ( the 800 # ) says they have never heard of the problem , and the dealer could not reproduce the problem while they had the car . In all three occurances , the car was parked head first in a garage , and since the front wheels were stuck , the car could not be towed to the dealer before releasing the shifter ( hence temporarily solving the problem ) . And the dealer , and Mitsubishi , refused to send someone to check the car while it was stuck . I KNOW there is smething wrong with the transmission ( shifting from 2nd to 3rd ) , and getting stuck at random , but I ca n't get the dealer to fix it . I need your help with the mechanical problems , and with how to handle Mitsubishi . All hints and suggestions are greatly appreciated , and sorry to bore you with the long post . Thanks , Rabih .

Initial results indicate the delta DOR pass on April 22 was unsuccessful due to ground station hardware problems but the one on April 23 was successfully performed . 2 . On April 23 , a cruise science Memory Readout ( MRO ) was performed for the Magnetometer ( MAG ) instrument . Analysis indicates the data was received properly . 3 . On April 23 , the spare power relay contacts were commanded closed via the spacecraft stored sequence . These relays were commanded closed by the CDS ( Command Data Subsystem ) prior to launch and were again commanded closed to preclude the possibility at Jupiter of the PPS relays/wiring being a source of internal electrostatic charge ( IESD ) . 4 . On April 26 , cruise science Memory Readouts ( MRO ) were performed for the Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer ( EUV ) , Dust Detector ( DDS ) , and Magnetometer ( MAG ) instruments . Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly . 5 . During the period from April 26 to April 27 , a navigation cycle was performed . This navigation cycle provided near-continuous acquisition of two-way doppler and ranging data during three consecutive passes of the spacecraft over DSS-63 , DSS-14 , and DSS-43 . 6 . On April 26 , real-time commands were sent to test slew the Radio Relay Antenna ( RRA ) in preparation for the mini-sequence slew test on April 28 . The RRA was slewed from approximately 3.5 degrees from stow to approximately 20.3 degrees . Preliminary analysis indicated the antenna slewed to about 18 degrees which was well within the predicted range . The RRA was commanded back to approximately 15.2 degrees from stow . Preliminary analysis indicated the antenna reached about 15.8 degrees also well within the predicted range . The RRA motor temperature was at 1 degree C at the start of the activity and had increased to 1.6 degrees C at its completion . After verifying proper RRA slewing , the RRA slew test mini-sequence was uplinked to the spacecraft for execution on April 28 . Upon successful uplink , a Delayed Action Command ( DAC ) was sent which will reposition the stator on May 4 to its initial pre-test position . Also , a DAC was sent to turn the Two-Way Noncoherent ( TWNC ) on April 28 prior to the start of the RRA slew test mini-sequence . 7 . On April 27 , a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to 264 hours , its planned value during this mission phase . 8 . On April 28 , the RRA slew test executed nominally . The spacecraft under stored sequence control performed six RRA slews starting at about 16 degrees from stow and going to 53 degrees , back to 25 degrees , then to 51 degrees , back to 22 degrees , then to 48 degrees and then back to 21 degrees . All of the slews were well within the predicted range . The RRA motor temperature was at 2.3 degrees C at the start of the activity and had increased to 4.4 degrees C at its completion . After completion of the RRA slews , real-time commands were sent to reconfigure back to the pre-test configuration . 9 . The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant change ( greater than 25 DN ) throughout this period . The AC measurement reads 17 DN ( 3.9 volts ) . The DC measurement reads 134 DN ( 15.7 volts ) . These measurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special anomaly team . 10 . The Spacecraft status as of April 29 , 1993 , is as follows : a ) System Power Margin - 75 watts b ) Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin c ) Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner d ) Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 23 degrees off-sun ( lagging ) and 4 degrees off-earth ( leading ) e ) Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps ( coded ) /LGA-1 f ) General Thermal Control - all temperatures within acceptable range g ) RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range h ) Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS , EUV , UVS , EPD , MAG , HIC , and DDS i ) Probe/RRH - powered off , temperatures within acceptable range j ) CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours Time To Initiation - 203 hours GDS ( Ground Data Systems ) : 1 . The first Galileo-GDS test of the MGDS V18.0 Command System ( CMD ) took place April 27 , 1993 with DSS-61 ( Madrid 34 meter antenna ) . The test went well and demonstrated that the new command system interfaced with the new DSN ( Deep Space Network ) Group 5 Command Processor Assembly ( CPA ) . The test was successful and the next test for V18.0 CMD is scheduled for May 1 , 1993 with DSS-15 ( Goldstone 34 meter antenna ) . 2 . The April System Engineers Monthly Report ( SEMR ) /Ground System Development Office ( GSDO ) MMR was conducted Thursday , April 29 . A review of current Project and Institutional ( DSN and MOSO ) system status was conducted . On-going cruise development plus the GSDO Phase 1 and 2 delivery schedules , past months accomplishments and potential problem areas were discussed . No significant schedule changes or significant problems were reported . TRAJECTORY As of noon Thursday , April 29 , 1993 , the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory status was as follows : Distance from Earth 187,745,300 km ( 1.26 AU ) Distance from Sun 296,335,800 km ( 1.98 AU ) Heliocentric Speed 89,100 km per hour Distance from Jupiter 522,015,800 km Round Trip Light Time 20 minutes , 58 seconds SPECIAL TOPIC 1 . As of April 29 , 1993 , a total of 70259 real-time commands have been transmitted to Galileo since Launch . Of these , 65150 were initiated in the sequence design process and 5109 initiated in the real-time command process . In the past week , 74 real time commands were transmitted : 73 were initiated in the sequence design process and one initiated in the real time command process . Major command activities included commands to perform the initial RRA slew test , uplink the RRA slew test mini-sequence , DACs to reposition the stator and turn the TWNC on , reset the command loss timer , and execute the RRA slew test . ___ _____ ___ /_ /| /____/ \ /_ /| Ron Baalke | baalke @ kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov | | | | __ \ /| | | | Jet Propulsion Lab | ___| | | | |__ ) |/ | | |__ M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand /___| | | | ___/ | |/__ /| Pasadena , CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and |_____|/ |_|/ |_____|/ | part vegetable .

Center for Regional Studies Lines : 55 In article < C7185t.9xJ @ unix.amherst.edu > eerginel @ unix.amherst.edu ( ERDEM ERGINEL ) asked : [ EE ] No , no flaming here . Just a simple question . ... with a simple answer ! [ EE ] As far as I know most of the Armenians belong to the Gregorian Orthodox [ EE ] faith and such was the case in nineteenth century Ottoman Empire . It is [ EE ] also known that some Armenian communities were converted into Catholicism [ EE ] and Protestantism by the Western European missionaries in this period . The vast majority of Armenians in eastern Anatolia were Gregorian or Armenian Apostolic . There was , however , a higher percentage of non-Gregorian Armenians in Cilicia , closer to the Mediterranean , in Adana , Marash , Aintab , etc . [ EE ] Another known fact is that almost half of the Armenians living in Anatolia [ EE ] did not speak any Armenian , but used Turkish in their everyday lives . This is not true . While it was forbidden for Armenians to speak Armenian in certain areas of Cilician Armenia , most all Armenians spoke Armenian . In fact , Turks who interacted with Armenians also spoke Armenian ! For sure , most all Armenians , especially men , also knew Turkish in order to function in larger society . [ EE ] My question is , given so many separations in the Armenian community , what [ EE ] was the common denominator of the Armenian people that allowed Armenian [ EE ] nationalism to emerge in the nineteenth century ? As I stated , religion [ EE ] was not uniform ( unlike the Greeks ) and many Armenians could n't even speak [ EE ] Armenian . I would like to know what factors brought the Armenians in the [ EE ] Ottoman Empire together and led to the formation of an Armenian [ EE ] consciousness . The Armenians in Turkey were persecuted because they were Armenian , regardless of the specific branch of Christianity they professed . The resultant Armenian nationalism was in direct reaction to this persecution . Even at the later stages of WWI , and after the genocide , many Armenians who were converted to Islam were also exterminated because they continued as Armenian Moslems . This practice continued well into the 1920s by Ataturk in parallel with the policy of clearing out pockets of steadfast Islamic fundamentalism . Many of these converted Armenians , ironically , in order to stay alive , were staunch Moslems . [ EE ] Any information will be appreciated . You answered your own question ! The common thread throughout your inquiry was the word Armenian ! [ EE ] Regards , -- David Davidian dbd @ urartu.sdpa.org | `` Armenia has not learned a lesson in S.D.P.A .

The CLIPPER initiative is an announcement by Clinton that all the '' secure '' voice phones will use the same crypto chip , as a de-facto government standard . Problem is , the government is admitting that they hold the keys to break the code easily , and the Justice department will be using the keys to listen in on `` illegal activities . '' Many people are really scared about such an initiative because it is a major step towards outlawing real crypto protection on things like email if you read the press release . The project was developed by NSA and given to NIST . It uses two keys S1 and S2 that the government claims are needed to break the code . They claim that these keys will be handed to two different companies , and when they get a warrant to do a wiretap ( the chip is nicknamed the wiretap chip ) , they have to get the keys from both companies . People have poked holes through and through the press release official version and shown how it is nowhere near as nice as it sounds , and I have given the simplified version .

My > *supposition* is that if we were to find the SAME players consistently > ( year after year ) at one end of the bell or the other , then we might > be able to make some reasonable conclusions about *those* players > ( as opposed to all baseball players ) . Let 's be careful here . If players ' performance was completely random in ( Clutch-No Clutch ) , then you would still expect some players to be good in the clutch every year and some to be not-so-good every year . With two years worth of data , you 'd have 1/4 of the players good each year , 1/4 bad each year , and 1/2 would have one good and one bad year . We have 96 players for 5 years ( '84-'88 ) . Just flipping a coin , you'd expect 3 players to be good all 5 years and 3 to be bad every year . This is what we actually get -- No . of good years 0 1 2 3 4 5 Clutch performers 4 10 37 24 18 3 Coin flip ( random ) 3 15 30 30 15 3 Essentially the distribution of clutch performers by number of years of good performance is the same as what you would get if the process leading to deviations from non-clutch performance was completely random . If there was anything to clutch hitting ( at least in this definition ) that had any predictive capability , you expect to see the number of players at the ends to be much larger than that predicted by flipping a coin . Further , if you limit yourself to players who were a lot above or below average in clutch situations ( say , 1 standard deviation from the mean ) more than one year , the random explanation still looks good . In the four years ( '84-'87 ) that I looked at the data from Elias , there were 79 ( 29 ) players with a minimum of 25 ( 50 ) at bats in clutch situations that were 1 sigma from the mean two different years . Of those 79 ( 29 ) players , 38 ( 14 ) of them changed sign between the two years . In other words , they were great clutch hitters one year and really horrible the other year . If it was just a random process , you 'd expect those numbers to be 39.5 ( 14.5 ) . Everything that 's been measured about clutch hitting over a period of years that could be used to predict any ability with any proposed definition has looked like a random process ( with the caveat that there may be something related to platoon advantage that could be dragged out of the data -- e.g. , John Lowenstein probably never had a `` clutch '' AB against a left-handed pitcher , but he might well have had some in blowouts , so that there would be a bias since his clutch ABs would be more geared to his platoon advantage ) . This is not a subject that has been glanced at casually . A lot of people have put a lot of effort into studying it and every one of them , with the exception of the Elias study , has been unable to find anything that would allow you to predict how someone will do in clutch situations better than flipping a coin . ( Self-serving plug follows : some of the flaws in the Elias study are discussed in my paper in the forth- coming SABR book , _The Perfect Game_ , by Taylor Publishing . The authors are supposed to get a slice of the advance , so go bug your local bookstores now , and maybe I can get enough to take my wife to dinner once . : - ) Harold -- Harold Brooks hbrooks @ uiatma.atmos.uiuc.edu National Severe Storms Laboratory ( Norman , OK ) '' I used to work for a brewery , too , but I did n't drink on the job .

As the walls came tumbling down and tear gas filled the air , cult leader David Koresh sprang into action . He left his third-floor bedroom and began looking around the house , making sure women and children were secure and checking that everyone had their gas masks on properly . Within hours , the compound became an inferno . Nine Branch Davidians excaped . This is their story , gleaned from lawyers who spoke with six of them who are jailed on charges that include conspiracy and murder . That day the six said a portable radio offered the only contact with the outside world since Koresh 's right-hand man , Steve Schneider , ripped out the compounds 's phone line after FBI agents called before dawn Monday saying this was the cults last chance : Come out or prepare to get forced out . They kept their word . By dawn , tanks were battering the Mount Carmel compound , punching for hours to creat holes for tear gas to enter . The BD meanwhile proceeded with their daily routines . Strapped into gas masks , the women did laundry . Others read Bibles in their rooms . The 17 children , all under 10 , remained by their mothers ' sides . Still , it was hard to ignore what was happening around them . Each time a tank rammed the poorly-constructed building it shook violently . Cult members dodges falling gypsum wallboard and doors . Hundreds of gas canisters hurled in from the armored vehicles were filling the air with noxious fumes . The flying canisters were more frightening than the tanks . At least one man was hit in the face . The gas began filling the air , driven by heavy gusts of wind coming through windows and the holes the tanks made . Scattered throughout the house , the cult members made no efforts to gather . Then the FBI sent in its biggest weapon -- a massive armored vehicle headed for a chamber , lined with cinder blocks , where authorities hoped to find Koresh and Schneider and fire tear gas directly at them . Here the cult members ' story diverges from the government 's version . The FBI says cult members set fires in three places . But each of the six cult members , in separate discussions with lawyers , consistently gave versions at odds with the FBI 's account . They say the tank flattened a barrel of propane , spilling its contents . And as the tank thundered through the house , it tipped over lit lanterns , spitting flames that ignited the propane and other flammables . The home of used lumber , plywood , and wallboard tacked together with tar paper was vulnerable . The building erupted . Nine BD's escaped jumping through windows and dashing through other openings . Others died groping in the blackness . Frank

We were having a problem with instability in the universal gravitational constant that day : the closer I got to those exposed fangs ( still dripping , no doubt , with the viscera of the last foolhardy experimenter cum canine psychology ) the bigger and heavier the dog appeared to become . Also , recall that the distribution of the ~150lb is one five pound jaw+teeth operated by two 70lb muscles driven by a .005 ounce brain possessing an instinctual heuristic composed of equal parts of bloodlust and ravening hunger . The other ~5 lb is , of course , dog poop , but that varies all over the place as the dog deposits it regularly on the painstakingly manicured and tended lawns of the dog 's owner 's neighbors ( whilst continuously replenishing its inexhaustible supply , no doubt by consuming the likes of folks like me ) . > You have , I presume , thumbs ? Grapple with it and tear it 's head > off ! My very thought at the time , but as I looked down at these once formidable instruments of mayhem , I realized they had become weak and atrophied by too many sedentary hours tapping away at my ergonomically-correct CRT keyboard . There was only one option left : I reached down to the toolbox near my car and grasped my Craftsman 150 ft-lb torque wrench , surely the bludgeon of dire necessity if ever there was one . To my amazement and confusion , the setter started shaking and rolling on the grass , then leapt to its feet and vanished down the street , still quivering and occasionally looking back at me . `` Seven at One Blow ! '' I exclaimed , flexing my new-found biceps and brandishing my Terrible Weapon of Invincibility as I stalked the now-secure environs of my domicile . It was only later that I found out what the dog apparently knew all along : the wrench was defective , would no longer measure torque accurately , and Sears would n't fix it or replace it .

Well I had to get that off my chest and while I 'm at it ... . Mario is the Michael Jordan of hockey . All that fucker has to do is fall on the ice and the closet guy to him gets at least 2 . Last night in the 3rd game between NJ and Pitt , he was being pushed while skating across the front of the goal while trying to get a shot off . The guy on him was doing a good job , so he got off a weak shot , but then he decided to fall to the ice . Then the fucking ref ( Van Helloamend ? ) called the guy for holding . They replayed the play , and my roomate ( who is clueless about hockey ) wanted to know what the NJ guy did to get a call , because it was so fucking obvious the NJ player had both hands on his stick , and no , he did not trip him . It is simple , Mario gets touched , he falls to the ice , automatic 2 . But the thing that really pissed me off is , Pitt scored the 3rd or 4th goal , I do n't remember , on the resulting PP and eventually won 4-3 . His diving/calls makes a HUGE difference in the outcome of a game . They got ta stop the damn holding and interference that is so fucking obvious . That is not hockey . It allows inferior players to bring down the level of the better players , and allows inferior teams to beat better ones . This has pissed me off for many years now , and it has improved somewhat . However , during the playoffs and 3rd periods , the damn refs must misplace their balls , because they sure do n't make any calls that show that they got any .

Today 's Boston Globe interviewed a former Unification Church leader who is now a consultant on cults . He said the FBI 's approach was totally wrong . He said they should have tried to break down the BD 's loyalty to Koresh through psychological means . Koresh 's whole theology was based on an approaching confrontation with the forces of evil in the world and a seige mentality based on this . The Feds played into his hands **PERFECTLY** . By surrounding the compound with tanks and playing loud rock music and glaring lights at them they strongly reinforced Koresh 's message that the outside world was evil and threatening . He said instead they should have set up a picnic atmosphere , and acted inviting and friendly . If they broadcast anything over PA systems it should have been loving relatives reflecting on pleasant events from the cult members' childhoods . The idea is to make the outside world and surrender seem like a pleasant , desirable alternative . Interesting comments . -- -peter

What you are effectively doing is implying that if a player plays really well , he 'stores up ' mistakes that can be used at a later time . Ths is not so . Roy is the 'villain ' , as you so succinctly put it , because he allowed a very cheap goal . If you think Roy outplayed Hextall , perhaps you should get a tape of the game and watch the first 7-8 minutes of the third period . NHL goaltenders _make_ some great saves . If they did not , they would not be in the NHL in the first place . I do not expect any particular goalie to be able to make the great saves all of the time , even though they are occasionally required . However , when it comes to a routine shot like Sakic 's , especially at such a crucial time in a game , I do n't think there are any legitimate excuses . > Hextall , on the other hand , had a lot of lucky bounces > [ description of lucky bounces ... .. ] > Hextall was n't particularly brilliant on those plays ... I am not arguing that Hextall was brilliant . I am arguing is that a relatively weak wrist shot from the outside of the circle shold not result in a goal . > ... but it was just the 1 goal . The timing stank , but against > an explosive team like Quebec , they gave them 1 opportunity too many with > a powerplay that was totally unnecessary . In a one-goal game with less than a minute to go there is no such thing as 'just the 1 goal ' . I have not defended Dionne for taking the penalty either ... in fact I think it was a boneheaded move . But it led to _one_ goal only , and Montreal had a _two_ goal lead . My main concern is the second goal . > This most certainly was a team loss ... Leclair missed his opportunities , > as did Bellows and Brunet . Dionne took a bad penalty . Damphousse and Lebeau > were *silent* . Carbonneau and Savard were a step behind all night . Roy gave > up the bad goal . Roy , by no means , can be singled out for this loss . What you say about the skaters is absolutely true . But realize that the game was effectively *won* . You could watch any hockey game ( in fact , you could watch any sporting event period ) and spend hours discussing the 'what if 's ' w.r.t . missed opportunities . They are not important when the final result is decided . If I get the time soon , I 'll watch the game again and email you a list of lucky Montreal bounces and a list of Quebec offensive screwups . Montreal was _leading_ with a minute to go . The goalie is the last line of defence , and I will grant that extra attention is focussed on him , sometimes without justification . But Roy gave up a *lousy* goal , and a team can not afford such a goal . > > Roy looked like a player in an industrial league on Sakic 's shot . > And Hextall did n't on Dionne 's goal ? Please . WHO CARES ? Of what value is it to justify one lousy play with a totally unrelated lousy play ? I could do a Hextall critique if you 'd like . But if you 're going to assess his performance , keep in mind that he made the key saves at the key times . > Roy is paid big money because > that is his value compared to other goalies ... and he still is in the top 5 For the record , I did not say that Roy was not one of the top goaltenders in the league . In fact , I agree that he is . > The Montreal media is the quickest to heap praise and then hurl derogatory > comments against the Habs . They are no better than uninformed fans . I assume you are referring to me . However , I have pointed out that I think the loss can be blamed on Roy . I have not said he sucks , nor do I think I've made any other 'derogatory comments ' . If you regard objective ( and informed , FYI ) observations as derogatory , I really ca n't help you . -- dchhabra @ stpl.ists.ca

Organization : University of Utah Computer Center Lines : 25 Hey All- We have an old ( 1990 ) external HD attached to the Plus in our lab . It had given us flawless service until last week . The problem : Someone in our lab has an old 512 that was upgraded a couple years ago to a Plus with an aftermarket SIMM/SCSI setup ( Digigraphics `` SIMMer '' ) . the DB25 SCSI plug runs through the back of the machine and attaches to the board with a 26-pin rectangular connector . Well , this guy had removed the back from the machine , to put more memory in , and had disconnected the the SCSI plug . Since the 26-pin connector is symmetrical ( not keyed ) he may have reinstalled it upside down , essentially reversing the pins on the DB25 . He came in and asked if he could try out our HD on his SCSI port ( it had never been used ) . Naive fools that we are , we said o.k.. His computer failed to recognize the drive . Now , none of the computers in our lab will recognize it . We tried Disk Doctor , and it does n't recognize anything on the SCSI chain . Could installing the SCSI upside down have wrecked the HD 's driver board ? The drive seems to spin up all right and unpark itself upon powerup . The events are too coincidental to attribute the problem to stiction . Any help greatly appreciated- James jak @ fff.chem.utah.edu ( NeXT Mail )

The price of this graphics card that I got is $ 185 from a local dealer . It may be less from mail order . It has OS/2 2.0 drivers comes with it which supports 256 colors on all resolution . From these results , it has double the performance of a Et4000AX based card in 256 colours mode . Philip Sinn sinn @ carson.u.washington.edu University of Washington * It is all my opinions *

It is my understanding that all True-Type fonts in Windows are loaded in prior to starting Windows - this makes getting into Windows quite slow if you have hundreds of them as I do .

In this case , it was unimportant as to who set the fire . The Davidians would have burned no matter what , ESPECIALLY if the BATF/FBI set the fire as this would make the beseiged martyrs to Vernon Howell and therefore rocket to heaven . A few comments from the remaining Davidians scattered throughout the country seemed to confirm this theory ( One cult member said that she wished that she had been there , and that now she would have to wait for Vernon to Return for them . She actually seemed upset that she did not burn with them ) .

Pick up a list of the Labor parties proposals for MK prior to the election and pay attention to the order . Correlate this with the number of Arab party members eligible to vote in party elections . Further correlate this with the voting results from Arab areas . Lo and behold , you will discover that Israeli Arab Labor party members did not band together unanimously or en large for a select group of Arab candidates . This problem is further exacerbated by the rifts between Israeli Arabs . Some claim membership to right wing parties while others vote for parties that do not pass the minimum cutoff . I worked within the labor party during the late 70 's elections ( not this last one ) as a volunteer and was privy to the voting results that were returned from the local delegates elected . At the time , the system was structured differently but it did not cease to amaze me that there was no massive effort to lobby for Arab reps. by their own delegates . | > Exactly what basis do you have for saying this when the Labour party | > has never put an Arab into a Cabinet post and insists its coalition | > members do the same ? Why and on what basis are you reassuring me in | > the face of 50 years of discriminatory practise ? Quite simply , if all eligible Arab voters became members of the Labor party and voted , they would be able to command more than % 15 of the delegates . This is a power base that can not be ignored ! Especially when they are not ranked high in the party ( once again due to lack of political power ) . I have seen how the labor party works from the inside and my experience has been that , as in most political situations , the MKs act out of their own self-interest . And to answer your question , I `` broke '' with labor because I felt that they were heeding too much to the right-wing and ultra-orthodox coalition members . | > > From `` The OTHER Front '' , July 29 , 1992 .

In drumming up support for his seat , MK [ ? ] would not be averse to using this argument , or it could be used on his behalf .

So is there any problems putting a drive formatted vertically on its side horizontally ? I got a drive a few years ago with the rubber feet on the side , etc . and have used it like that since ( obviously designed for that orientation ) . However , it does n't fit under any of the clever places I can think of to place it , so I would really like to lay it flat and put it under a low shelf . This is probably not a `` newer '' drive , and it is only 70 meg , but when I bought it , it was a large drive for an average user ( comparable to buying a 200 meg drive today ) . So is my old , 70 meg drive as fragile ( or not ) as a new 200 meg drive ?

Granted , he has n't been a full time player but when he does play I 've always thought he had a good bat . He might be demoralized about not playing full time , but he has n't been shuttled around . I think he 's been in New York ever since he had 34 hits in 100 AB back in 1989 , or 90 , I believe . I do n't think he is gold glove calibre , but he does n't boot it around either .

It 's an important issue , especially if one of the escrow agents decides they 'd rather stop offering the service . I assume that if the escrow agent is n't the government , then the contract for providing escrow service would include some termination clause like returning the keys . > The easiest way is a user fee for each clipper chip manufactured . > This makes the funding separate from government . But who 's the user paying the fees here , and what 's the service ? If the user is the government , then the funding 's not separate from the government . If the user is the buyer , what 's the service ? Keeping the key for me ? No thanks - I do n't need , and wo n't buy their service ! Not telling everybody my key ? Sounds like blackmail ! If the user is the manufacturer , does the user have a choice about buying ? The alternative is to just generate the key and not escrow it , which is fine - I 'd certainly pay more for this kind of key than an escrowed key ! Face it , the escrow provider is providing a service the users do n't want . The only people who want it are the government , not the users . What you 're really talking about is either the government paying for the service , up front or per-year , either from general taxes , or from a special direct tax on wiretap chips , or on an indirect tax ( forcing the manufacturer to pay the fee to the escrow agent . ) I hope the escrow people have no way of finding out your name from your serial number , especially if the escrow is a government agency . Here in New Jersey , we have lots of people willing to provide that sort of services for user fees . There are people willing to keep your store from burning down for a small monthly fee , though sometimes people refuse to pay and discover that the service really was effective . If you go to a baseball game at Yankee Stadium , there are people who will watch your car in the parking lot for a small user fee . Something could scratch the paint , after all .

No , and in fact , that was Ferreira 's original strategy , which the troika proceeded to simply continue to implement . There was n't exactly a radical shift in policy when he was ousted ( something people seem to forget ) . The only real question is whether they did it as well as Ferreira could have if he stayed , or whether the basic strategy was flawed ( since Ferreira has been quoated as saying he 's going to do something different in Anaheim with the Ducks , my guess is that it was n't as good in practice as it was on paper , and he 's tweaking it a bit second time around ) . One also has to wonder whether the strategy would have been a lot better if we had n't had those injuries , and whether we 're complaining about the weather because an earthquake collapsed the root cellar . > Of course , Ferreira had also traded a number of veterans with marginal > contributions before he was fired , so it 's not clear that this would have > been different . Besides , they *were* marginal contributors . Let 's also NOT FORGET that Ferreira came *THIS* close to trading Kelly Kisio , which , if the rumors I 've heard are true , was over the strong objections of other aspects of Shark management and probably had a lot to do with both his ouster and the three-headed , consensus oriented GM .

What is improved , what |is Significant , and what does this have to do with carrying more |equipment on a servicing mission ? Also , as implied by other posters , why |do you need to boost the orbit on this mission anyway ? Maybe you have |something here , but could you please clarify it for us on the net ? | RIght now the HST sevicing mission is listed as 11 days . before it was listed as 9 days . they just kicked up the number of spacewalks to 5 , after simulations indicated that it was not do-able in 4 . After all the space walking , they are going to re-boost the HST's orbit . I think right now it 's sitting at 180 miles up , they would like 220 . I do n't know the exact orbit numbers . I know when HST was first flown , it was placed in the Highest possible Shuttle orbit . Now the shuttle can cary a thing called the EDO pallet , or extended duration orbiter pallet . It 's mostly LOX/LH for the fuel cells and RCS gear , plus more O2 and canisters for the life support re-breathers . maybe more nitrogen too . THe limit on space-walking is a function of suit supplies ( MASS ) and Orbiter Duration . In order to perform the re-boost of the HST , the OMS engines will be fired for a long period . Now the shuttle is a heavy thing . THe HST is n't light either . THe amount of OMS fuel needed to fly both up is substantial . a small booster carried up and used to boost HST on it 's own will weigh significantly less then the OMS fuel required to Boost both HST and SHUttle , for a given orbital change . From what i understand , the mass margins on the HST missions are tight enough they ca n't even carry extra Suits or MMU 's . Now if they used a small tug , I would bet , just a wild guess , that the savings on amss margin would allow carrying the EDO pallet , extra suits , more consumables , parts for the flaky FGS sensor , parts for the balky solar electronics , and still enough for a double magnum of champagne . or the HST could even get placed into some sort of medium orbit . The reason they want a high orbit , is less antenna pointing , and longer drag life . | > and that means you can then carry EDO packs and enough consumables | > so the SHuttle mission can go on long enough to also fix the | > array tilt motors , and god knows what else is going to wear out | |From what I 've heard , the motors are fine - it is one of the two |sets of electronics that control the motors that needs a fix .

Well , the '93 Mustang Cobra ( which , from all reports , uses the same running gear as '94 Mustang ) has 4-wheel disks . I can't speak for the new Camaro , but I think it does , too . Also , stop and think about the markets here . The Mustang is , and always has been , a mass-market sporty car ( that 's where the '' pony car '' class came from ) with a performance model . That's why it has the econo-box running gear .

The cars you listed are designed for a specific market niche , and they both fit those niches very well . The Mustang , at least , does well in multiple markets ; I ca n't speak for the Camaro .

You assume that the general public `` ca n't handle the truth '' and then , based on this assumption , go for the fluff arguments . Then someone , who can understand a good argument , comes along and asks `` why do n't you just develop the spinoffs ? '' or `` why ca n't we just get our spinoffs from some other program , like the military ? '' There are some good arguments for space development without relying on its side effects .

And if you 're going to use spinoffs you better make darn sure you are right . Teflon has been around since before NASA .

Other things they hype on the sheet are a 'double quaduple dynamic astigmatism focus ' . Right . They mean they use two lenses . Advanced Invar shadow mask . ViewMatch color control which they claim is and easy-to-use system that adjusts colors to closely match printer output . As near as I have been able to figure out , this translates to separate controls for red , green , and blue . How this makes it easy to match for printer output is beyond me .

Daigle has shown an Attitude the latter part of this season many folks havne't liked , and after coming back from his ( second ) multi-game suspension for being stupid , he 's really tanked in his performance .

I take it that you 're expressing skepticism at the idea that those ignorant savages could have influenced the Constitution of the people who stole their continent . You could be right , but it sounds plausible to me . Is there any reason that you dismiss it out-of-hand ? Here 's some more : Recent scholarship has shown that in the mid-1700s Indians were not only invited to participate in the deliberations of our `` founding fathers , '' but that the Great Binding Law of the Iroquois Confederacy arguably became the single most important model for the 1754 Albany Plan of Union , and later the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution . That this would be absent from our school texts , and from history , and from media is not surprising given the devotion Americans feel to our founding myth : Great men gathered to express a new vision that has withstood the test of time . If it were revealed that Indians had a role in it , imagine the blow to the American psyche . ... By 1754 , when most of these men and others gathered to creat the Albany Plan of Union , the first try at confederation , they invited forty-two members of the Iroquois Grand Council to serve as advisors on confederate structures . Benjamin Franklin freely acknowledged his interest in the Iroquois achievement in a famous speech at Albany Congress : `` It would be a strange thing ... if six nations of ignorant savages [ sic ] should be capable of forming such a union and be able to execute it in such a manner that it has subsisted for ages and appears indissoluble , and yet that a like union should be impractical for ten or a dozen English colonies . '' According to Grinde , Franklin convened meetings of Iroquois chiefs and congressional delegates in order to `` hammer out a plan that he acknowedged to be similar to the Iroquois Confederacy . '' Grinde is Professor Donald Grinde , Jr. , of the University of California at Riverside whose book _The Iroquois and the Founding Fathers of the American Nation_ addresses this issue . -- Doug Graham dgraham @ bnr.ca My opinions are my own .

Let me see if I got this right . Group of religious plinter schismatics erect a compound and after at least fifty years of peaceful co-existance with the outside community ( having shoot outs only with each other ) - this makes them dangerous . Prior history would seem to indicate they are only dangerous to themselves . Last I knew there was no National Branch Davidian Party blaming the debacle in VeitNam on Foreign Meddlers and three-two beer , calling for the Rounding up of Meat Packers , Growers and Slaughter Houses . You want tough political choices - how about letting odd balls be odd balls ? ( I know , this requires tolerance for those that go into Government - but we all know people who have no useful skills . ) ith the death of the children everybody is getting real upset - what about the other 40 plus people ? I suppose that you consider children to be property of the state with the family as custodians . ( In the States its the other way around - children are parental property . ) If what you consider a Corrupt Government demands that you send you children into _their_ tender care - I suppose that you will obey the State and turn you children over to their care .

The acetaminophen is the agent of concern in overdose of this OTC medication . A single dose of acetaminophen of 10 grams or greater can cause hepatotoxicity , and doses of 25 grams or more are potentially fatal from hepatic necrosis . If I recall correctly , the metabolism of acetaminophen at high doses involves N-hydroxylation to N-acetyl-benzoquinoneimine , which is a highly reactive intermediate , which then reacts with sulfhydryl groups of proteins and glutathione . When hepatic glutathione is used up , this intermediate then starts attacking the hepatic proteins with resulting hepatic necrosis . The insidious part of acetaminophen toxicity is the delay ( 2-4 days ) between ingestion and clinical signs of liver damage . This is NOT a nice way to die . As to taking 20-30 of these tablets , that comes to 5-7.5 grams of acetaminophen . In a normal adult , this would probably cause nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain , and loss of appetite .

A myth is more than a single story . The thought structure and world-paradigm in which that story is interpreted is as important a part of the myth as the story itself .

I 've seen this sort of effect when a runaway program ( which could be caused by an INIT conflict , for instance ) accidentally wacks on a register in the video hardware . Have you tried booting with no extensions and then letting the Q950 just sit there in the Finder ? You might also want to try changing to 24-bit addressing ( yes , I know you ca n't access your full 64 MB of RAM - it 's just an experiment ) as the video hardware registers ca n't be accessed then . Another thing to try as a 'recovery ' measure is to use something like QuickKeys to change the pixel depth of the display .

From : creps @ lateran.ucs.indiana.edu ( Stephen A. Creps ) Subject : Defending the Faith IV conference Organization : Indiana University Lines : 121 Enclosed is an advertisement for the Defending the Faith IV conference to be held at Franciscan University of Steubenville ( Ohio ) June 25-27 . I attended DTF III last year , and plan to go again this year . I would recommend it highly to Catholic interested in apologetics . There will be lots of music , well-known Catholic speakers , fellowship , as well as Eucharistic Liturgies Friday and Sunday . Registration is $ 85 per person , but I believe financial aid is available if you need it . Housing in residence halls ( each of which has its own Blessed Sacrament chapel ) , if desired , is $ 30/person for double occupancy for two nights ( $ 30 total ) . Reservations can also be made for you at the very nearby Holiday Inn . I think it was $ 47 a night there for my single room . Meals are available at the cafeteria ( Friday dinner through Sunday lunch ) for $ 38 or $ 32 , with or without breakfast , respectively . Franciscan University of Steubenville is located in eastern Ohio on US Route 22 , 1/2 mile west of the Ohio River and Ohio Route 7 . Greater Pittsburgh International Airport is less than one hour ( 35 miles ) from campus . Feel free to e-mail me if you have any question I can answer . Here is the agenda , as typed in by a friend of mine : Friday afternoon special : Reflections on C.S . Lewis , a preliminary session with Walter Hooper . Walter Hooper is one of the foremost international experts on the writings of C.S . Lewis . In 1963 , he served as secretary to C.S . Lewis , and he has since edited 18 of Lewis ' literary works for publication . Walter was ordained a priest in the Church of England in 1965 , serving in Oxford , England , until he entered the Catholic Church in 1988 . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Friday evening , opening session : In Search of the Truth : Finding the Fullness of Faith Bishop Fabian Bruskewitz .

Bullets go flying every > where . IMHO , these `` gunshot wounds '' were actually caused when the magazines > went up . Unlikely . Ammunition is not as dangerous when simply burned as it is when fired from a gun . The brass case is not capable of holding the pressure generated by burning powder , and will ( unless supported by the walls of a gun barrel or chamber ) simply split open . While this may cause small pieces of brass to fly around , it will not propel the bullet with any significant velocity . In fact , it was not uncommon in years past to dispose of old loaded cartridges by burning them . As long as you were not close enough to take a piece of flying brass in the eye , you were reasonably safe . Thus , the detonation of loaded magazines or loose rounds might cause slight injury but would be unlikely to cause fatal bullet wounds . -- Alane -- / -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -\ / NOBODY shares my opinions , | `` I am a jelly doughnut '' \ / especially not my employer | -- President John F Kennedy \ / -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -\

From : fennell @ well.sf.ca.us ( Michael Daniel Fennell ) Subject : SARSAT for tracking payload deployed by tether . Summary : Can SARSAT beacons be used for nonemergency purposes ? Keywords : tether , SARSAT , navigation Nntp-Posting-Host : well.sf.ca.us Organization : The Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link , Sausalito , CA Lines : 38 We are interested in constructing a reentry vehicle to be deployed from a tether attached to an orbiting platform . This will be a follow on to our succesful deployment of a 20 kilometer tether on the March 29 flight of SEDS ( Small Expendable Deployment System ) , which released an instrumented payload that reentered the earth 's atmosphere and burned up over the west coast of Mexico . This time we want to make a payload that can be recovered . We want to build it from `` off the shelf '' technology so as to do this as quickly and inexpensively as possible . We want to be able to track the payload after it has deployed its parachute . An idea we have is to put the same kind of radio beacon on it that is used with SARSATs ( Search and Rescue Satellites ) . It would turn on with the opening of the parachute and aid in tracking . These beacons are known in the marine industry as EPIRBs ( Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon ) . They are rugged ( they have to be to survive a ship wreck ! ) and cheap . We have several questions : 1 . What is the world authority regulating the use of SARSAT beacons . Are there multiple authorites , i.e . military and civilian ? 2 . What are the regulations regarding the use of SARSAT signals . Can they be used for one of a kind situations with a long lead time of warning the relevant authorities , or are they strictly reserved for life threatening emergencies ? 3 . What is the coverage of SARSATS ? Are they in LEO with only intermittant coverage of a fixed position on the earth , or are they in geosynchronous orbit ? 4 . Is there an industry organization governing the use and manufacture of these transponders ?

I do n't know how the rest of you read news , but here 's how I do it : I subscribe to an `` outernet '' system which allows me to dial up via modem and download e-mail and news articles automatically . When someone posts a huge attached binary file , I have no choice but to receive it along with all the other new articles in the groups I subscribe to . I also pay for the connect time , which is normally not a problem because I have a 14.4K modem and each day 's upload/download session takes only 5 minutes or so . Today 's session , however , lasted about 25 minutes because of ROMAN.BMP . Consequently , it cost me about $ 3.00 extra just to receive a file that I did n't want in the first place . If you have cool bitmaps that you want to make available , there are other ways to do it : either upload the file to an ftp site ( like ftp.cica.indiana.edu , which has a complete Windows section ) and tell people how to get to it , or use one of the newsgroups like alt.binaries.pictures ( or something like that ) , which are file archives rather than discussion groups .

For to show no interest in the existence of god takes no faith at all . You make the presumption that the _knowledge_ of the _possibility_ of something is enough to require faith to render that possibilty of no interest . It is a very different thing to say that you do n't believe something than it is to say that you don't have sufficent reason to believe something is even interesting to think about . It 's not either or . Sometimes is just something else more interesting that occupies your mind . I agree that faith and dogma are inevitable , but not necessarily applied to god and religion . It takes both faith and dogma to expect the sun to come up every morning , but there is overwhelming reason every single day , day in and day out , for _everyone_ to put his faith and dogma there .

You live on US territory , you live by US laws - period . ( unless you are a congressman ) Sure , the situation was handled badly by both the BATF and the FBI . It would have been all so easy to detain Koresh and his core members while they were out in the streets of Waco . The BATF , threatened with budget cuts , was trying for a propaganda coup ... and dragging the press along for the big commando-style assault is proof of that . They should be roasted for both their imcompetance and their mindset . On the other hand , they DID have the legal right to do what they did . Once the attack was begun , they should have pressed on and finished it rather than let an interminable situation like that take root . The FBI also used poor judgement in a number of ways - but again , the laws we voters have approved , or the lawmakers who created them , gave them the right to do what they did . If BATF and the FBI are latter-day Gestapo , it is because the voters have allowed them to become that way . Waco was pure Americana - militarist mentality , religious fanaticism and unadulterated violence all rolled into one experience . We get what we pay for , or vote for , and this was the result of many choices we have made over the years . Do n't blame 'them ' - blame ourselves . We made 'them ' , we ARE 'them ' .

I have recently purchased ( within the last 8 months ) the BEL 966STW . While it is not a perfect detector by any means , it does do the job fairly well . Now , however , I pick up a car magazine at the airport and read about this Super Ka Wideband which is a superset of the Ka Wideband that this latest generation of detectors was touted as covering . So now BEL has a NEW series of detectors out that cover all the usual bands ( X , K , Ka photo , Ka wideband ) as well as the new Super Ka wideband . Just as there comes a point of diminishing returns when chasing increased PC computing power with faster and faster CPUs ( for the average home consumer , at least ) , it seems that there is now the same concern with radar detectors . Does it make sense to upgrade just 8 months after purchasing my `` new '' detector ? Is Valentine upgrading their equipment ? If so , it might be worth it for me to upgrade to the Valentine . I was in the market for a Valentine when I purchased the BEL but the 3-4 month waiting time was just too much for me since I had inadequate protection with my Passport . Life was much simpler when there was just X and K band and Escort has the best equipment on the market and there was no need to continuously shop for a new detector .

Minor point : Shea Stadium was designed as a multi-purpose stadium but not with the Jets in mind as the tennant . The New York Football Giants had moved to Yankee Stadium ( from the Polo Grounds ) in 1958 and was having problem with stadium management ( the City did not own Yankee Stadium until 1972 ) . The idea was to get the Giants to move into Shea . When a deal was worked out between the Giants and the Yankees the new AFL franchise , the New York Titans , approached the City about using the new stadium . The Titans were playing in Downing Stadium ( where the Cosmos played soccer in the 70s ) . Because Shea Stadium was tied into the World 's Fair anyway , the city thought it would be a novel idea to promote the new franchise and the World 's Fair ( like they were doing with the Mets ) . So the deal was worked out . > Of course , with the Jets gone to Jersey ( and a truly good football > stadium ) , the Mets are saddled with a multipurpose stadium where , > because it 's circular , the seats are almost always too far from the > action .

Do let me know > : which ... : - ) > > A brilliant example of using the introspective objection against > materialist theories of consciousness . Diplomatic : - ) I realize I 'm fighting Occam 's razor in this argument , so I 'll try to explain why I feel a mind is necessary . Firstly , I 'm not impressed with the ability of algorithms . They're great at solving problems once the method has been worked out , but not at working out the method itself . As a specific example , I like to solve numerical crosswords ( not the simple do-the-sums-and-insert-the-answers type , the hard ones . ) To do these with any efficiency , you need to figure out a variety of tricks . Now , I know that you can program a computer to do these puzzles , but in doing so you have to work out the tricks _yourself_ , and program them into the computer . You can , of course , 'obfuscate ' the trick , and write the program so that it is uncovered , but as far as I can see , the trick still has to be there in some form to be discovered . Does this mean that all the ideas we will ever have are already pre-programmed into our brains ? This is somewhat unlikely , given that our brains ultimately are encoded in 46 chromosomes worth of genetic material , much of which is n't used . One way around this is to bring the environment into the equation , but ( again , as far as I can see ) this still has an air of 'if you see object X , then perform action Y , ' and we do n't seem to get anywhere . The algorithm has to anticipate what it might see , and what conclusions to draw from it 's experience . The other problem with algorithms is their instability . Not many algorithms survive if you take out a large portion of their code , yet people survive strokes without going completely haywire ( there are side-effects , but patients still seem remarkably stable . ) Also , neurons in perfectly healthy people are dying at an alarming rate - can an algorithm survive if I randomly corrupt various bits of it's code ? The next problem is the sticky question of `` What is colour ? '' ( replace 'colour ' with the sensation of your choice . ) Presumably , the materialist viewpoint is that it 's the product of some kind of chemical reaction . The usual products of such a reaction are energy + different chemicals . Is colour a mixture of these ? If this is so , a computer wo n't see colour , because the chemistry is different . Does an algorithm that sees colour have a selective advantage over an equivalent that does n't ? It should n't , because the outputs of each algorithm ought to be the same in equivalent circumstances . So why do we see colour ? > > However , such a view is actually a nonsolution . How should minds be > able to act as observers , feel pain and pleasure and issue > commands any better than the brain ? Moreover , how do the interactions > occur ? A bit of idle speculation ... If I remember correctly , quantum mechanics consists of a wavefunction , with two processes acting on it . The first process has been called 'Unitary Evolution ' ( or ' U ' ) , is governed by Schroedinger 's equation and is well known . The second process , called various things such as 'collapse of the wavefunction ' or 'state vector reduction ' ( or ' R ' ) , and is more mysterious . It is usually said to occur when a 'measurement ' takes place , although nobody seems to know precisely when that occurs . When it does occur , the effect of R is to abruptly change the wavefunction . I envisage R as an interaction between the wavefunction and 'something else , ' which I shall imaginitively call 'part X . ' It seems reasonable to assume that _something_ causes R , although that something might be the wavefunction itself ( in which case , part X is simply the wavefunction . Note , though , that we 'd need more than U to explain R. ) Anyway , I 'm speculating that minds would be in part X . There seems to be some link between consciousness and R , in that we never see linear superpositions of anything , although there are alternative explainations for this . I 've no idea how a brain is supposed to access part X , but since this is only speculation , that wo n't matter too much : - ) My main point is that there might be a place for minds in physics . I 'll go back to my nice padded cell now , if that 's OK with you : - ) > > > Petri -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Kevin Anthoney kax @ cs.nott.ac.uk Do n't believe anything you read in .sig files . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

( I'm > not talking about Bronco II 's , I 'm referring to the Broncos that began > production in 1978 based on the F-150 chassis I believe ) Ahh Broncos . Well personally , I have a '78 . The blue book is just a hair over 3 grand . I bought it for 2500 and then bought new tires 650 front end rebuild 350 , carb rebuild 130 . Then i did the unthinkable and blew the engine ( not bronco specific , unmaintained engine with 168,000 ) 2400 more bucks there , now it is in nice condition , well after new seats out of a t-bird , radio , 2 amps , speakers , alarm , well the radio and amps were free and i bought the speakers used for 40 bucks , and the other speakers i took out of my old jeep ( Sell a Jeep for a bronco you might ask , but it was a Wagoneer ) . Its a lovely specimen , solid front and rear axels , ford 9 '' and a dana 44 up front . Watch the rear axel wrap , i busted off my u-bolts ONCE , i added traction shocks after that and have n't had a problem since . Also the bottom of the doors tend to rot , bottom of the tailgates likes to rust right up to the new ones that might be in your budget . The post 80 broncos have that sickly TTB front end and little stamped and folded steel radius arms were as the 78-79 have nice big cast iron longer radius arms ( ie more prspective wheel travel ) . The only rust i have is on my doors and a few dings in the sheet metal . I do n't know when the removeable tops were discontinued but they are fun . I just ordered a full convertable top for 400 $ for mine ( credit card ) . Do n't ever break the window if you have the double laminated bronzed privacy glass in your cap it is over 400 bucks to replace . My bronco also does pretty good offroad , i have n't bottomed out my suspension , YET , and have crossed over 3 foot deep of water with no problems , handles rocks like a charm too . One problem is it is WIDE and you sometimes ca n't follow a CJ or a Toyota , between two rocks or trees , and your grandmother will have a hard time getting up into it . BOB

That would be Clint Malarchuck . It was speculated at the time , that the injury was so serious that had he been playing at the other end of the rink at the time ( he was playing in the same end as the ambulence is parked ) , he never would have survived . Ditto , if he were playing anything other than a league with an ambulance on standby . If you 've seen video tape of the incident , it is amazing how much blood there was . It was literally spurting out all over the ice , as Clint grabbed his neck and watched the puddle in horror . Amazingly enough , he made a full recovery , and played again in the NHL . He was getting on in years at the time of the incident anyway , and did n't play for too long afterward . Some people speculated that he just could n't get himself back together after the incident , and I think he had a bunch of other personal problems dogging him afterward . He did eventually get back to form , and played another year or so after that , and then I believe he retired .

The best reason for ATM is that Adobe IS the standard . Truetype is a failed MS venture to undercut Adobe when Adobe was being nasty about keeping their formats proprietary .

It 's possible to make boards in other colors , and I have an ad for laser light-show equipment which offers the circuit boards in your choice of Day-Glo ( tm ) colors . The usual light green color is just the natural color of Fiberglas . The dark green or blue is the solder mask layer , and I suspect that color is a dye . John Nagle

Eminent domain is a state-mandated transaction in which one party is required to sell a piece of property which it owns to another party , regardless of whether the first party wishes to sell at all , at a price which is set by the state . I fail to see how this doctrine can be found in tort , bankruptcy or contract cases in general . Well , okay , sort of in bankruptcy ... * * * * * > > If so , so what ?

It did something that we as > a capitalistic society should want them to do : build a factory , create > industry and jobs . The cost of compliance was grossly > disproportionate to the damage faced by plaintiffs . Bang . Here 's one of the places where we widely diverge . You believe that the courts , in deciding a civil dispute between two parties , should consider as a factor -- perhaps as an overriding factor -- issues which I believe the court should ignore as being irrelevant to the dispute . _Boomer v. Atlantic Cement Co._ was an action brought by one party , Boomer , whose property rights were being violated on an ongoing basis by another party , the Atlantic Cement Company . The facts supported Boomer 's contention that Atlantic Cement was wrongfully damaging his property , and Boomer asked the court to order Atlantic Cement to stop doing so . End of story . There was no reason for the court to consider such issues as what a capitalistic society would want Atlantic Cement to do or whether the cost of compliance was disproportionate to the damage faced by the plaintiffs . Those issues had nothing to do with the case before the court . > Bill , if the government had stepped in and the EPA made a regulation > requiring multi-million dollar cement plants to be shut down because > of a smattering of cement dust , at a cost-benefit ratio of 15+:1 , > you 'd be up in arms . Why is it okay for the judicial branch to > interfere this way , but not the legislative or executive branches ? I 'd be up in arms ? Why do you assume that ? Quite the contrary , I'd probably support the action , since it would be based on the same general doctrine as the decision that I believe would have been correct in _Boomer_ : the idea that people 's property rights should not be violated for reasons of economic efficiency . In _Boomer_ it was Boomer's property rights which I believe the court should have protected ; in the hypothetical EPA ruling you 've presented , it 's the American people's collective property rights in a healthy physical environment . What good is cost-benefit ratio of 15+:1 if you wind up with cement dust in your air ? * * * * * > > > Your rule makes it per se illegal to ever operate a cement plant . > > > If the State of Massachusetts came up with a similar regulation , > > > you 'd be up in arms and complaining about interference with > > > property rights , and Fifth Amendment violations .

Yes . So what ? The courts are supposed to protect the specific rights of individuals , not the general interests of some nebulous society . If society can have its cement plant without violating anyone 's rights , fine . Otherwise society will somehow have to limp along with one less cement plant . ( See , Ted , I really _am_ a libertarian after all ! : - ) > That 's the whole point behind the Coase Theorem .

'' ? ? ? Which `` one '' are you speaking of ? _I_ want the legal regime to protect people 's rights . Besides , Coase 's Theorem only has real application in the never-never land of perfectly rational actors . In the real world ( 1 ) some people are going to be stubborn , ornery , spiteful or otherwise `` irrational '' from a economic point of view and ( 2 ) the purpose of the courts is to protect their right to be so . I do n't care if you can show me logically that your cattle are only doing $ 100 of damage to my property per head , so I should rationally sell you grazing rights to my land for , say , $ 150 per head -- I still retain the right to tell you that I just plain don't want any damned cattle on my property , not at any price . * * * * * > > And then you say : `` Everyone 's property rights were protected ; the > > plaintiffs were made whole ; unnecessary settlement costs were > > avoided .

[ wdstarr ] > > Then , by your argument , no tort plaintiff is ever made whole , because > the award of damages in involuntary . Why should we treat a nuisance > plaintiff any different than any other tort plaintiff ? We don't > require specific performance in the analogous contractual situation ; > why in tort ? Last question first : For the same reason as in contract law -- because to do so would come dangerously close to treading on the Thirteenth Amendment . As to your `` Then , by your argument , no tort plaintiff is ever made whole , because the award of damages in involuntary '' claim , you 're at least partially right . Faced with situations in which the wrong has already been done and the damage to the victim has already taken place and can not be reversed or undone , courts will try to set an equitable price tag on the loss suffered by the victim and require the wrongdoer to pay this price ( rather than an inflated price which the victim might prefer ) . In these cases , the `` sale '' has already taken place and is irreversible , and the court simply tries to ensure that a fair price is paid , under the doctrines that ( a ) only in certain circumstances should even a civil wrongdoer be forced to pay punitive or excessive prices and ( b ) even a genuine victim should not profit in an unjustified or inequitable manner from his victimhood . Both of these doctrines may be worth discussing or debating elsewhere , but neither is relevant to cases like _Boomer_ in which the wrongful act and the loss stemming from it are still in the future and _can_ be reversed/undone ( i.e. , prevented from happening at all ) by order of the court . In these types of cases , all the court has to do is require that the potential victim 's property rights are protected until and unless he agrees to sell them at a mutually-acceptable price . There is no need for the court to guess at the equitable value of the loss and force both sides to accept its finding . It can leave that operation up to the parties themselves . > > And again I ask : Since when are the courts supposed to be in the > > business of ensuring that `` unnecessary '' settlement costs are avoided ? > > ( If so , I 've been miseducated -- I always thought that the courts were > > supposed to be in the business of ensuring that justice is done . ) > > Unnecessary settlement costs are unjust because they are punitive . In cases like _Boomer_ , they 're simply a cost of doing business . The fact that the proprietors of the Atlantic Cement Co. got themselves into a position in which they found themselves over this barrel is simply a result of their own poor business decision to start up a cement plant without _first_ trying to negotiate with Boomer and everyone else whose property rights they 'd be violating via the operation of their plant . There 's nothing punitive or unjust about it . > > ( 2 ) It is `` completely sensible '' only if you believe that the alleged > > right of the owners of Atlantic Cement to stay in business and avoid > > losing a lot of their own money due to their own wrongful act , and > > the alleged right of several hundred Atlantic Cement employees to > > not have their jobs disappear , should trump the rights of people who > > own property which was damaged by Atlantic Cement 's wrongful acts . > > [ wdstarr ] > > Anybody who ever commits a wrongful act should disgorge their entire > set of possessions to wronged person ?

And the seller should be allowed to set his or her price for the privilege . No injustice , no punitive damages . * * * * * > > > You 'd like Posner , Bill . He 's a libertarian . > > > > Really ?

Atlantic Cement wanted to be able to _continue_ to violate Boomer 's rights . While the court may have been justified in setting an equitable price tag on the damage already committed , it had no reason and no need to set a price tag on the _future_ violations of Boomer 's rights and to then force Boomer to sell at that price . -- William December Starr < wdstarr @ athena.mit.edu >

Kinsman Precambrian Electronics 29 Falstaff Rd . Rochester , NY 14609 thomask @ kodak.com Copyright March 15 , 1991 ABSTRACT The format of images created for use by MS Windows 3.0/3.1 applications is documented in the MS Windows Programmer's Reference guide . This guide is intended as a clearify some wording of the specifications , and to put forth a recommendation among the various alternatives . Please send updates/corrections/suggestions and revisions to me . Please thank me for writing this on my own time by keeping my name with the document . Thank you for your respect . This document Copyright , 1991 , by Thomas B. Kinsman . If desired , a PostScript version of this document is available . This information is free . You get more than what you pay for . Do n't sue me if I 'm wrong . OVERVIEW The DIB image file format is intended to be a `` Device Independent Bitmap '' file format . ( What Microsoft means by `` Device Independent '' is unclear to me . ) Four pixel resolutions are supported : 1 bit , 4 bit , 8 bit , and 24 bit pixels . These images were intended for use on DOS ( IBM , or Little-Endian ) systems . If you are creating them on another architecture you will have to byte- swap all short and long integer values . By convention , DIB images end in the extension `` .BMP '' . This is because March 15 , 1991 - 2 - they are a super-set of earlier `` bitmap image files '' . Consequently you will sometimes hear DIB files referred to as `` BMP '' files . Since DIB images files are a super-set , there are three `` flavors '' of DIB images : o DOS DIB images . These are the recommended convention , and the form which I will describe how to create . They are intended for applications running under MS Windows /3.0 in a DOS environment . o OS/2 DIB images . My understanding is that these are the flavor of DIB images that were used by the Presentation Manager . o Old-style Bitmap images . March 15 , 1991 - 3 - DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FLAVORS The DOS DIB images consist of : 1 . A `` BITMAPFILEHEADER '' file header which identifies the file as a DIB file . This header also gives the total size of the image file , and the offset to the image data . 2 . A `` BITMAPINFOHEADER '' image header which specifies the image attributes . 3 . An optional palette of colors used by the image . If it exists , this may contain 2 , 16 , or 256 entries . Each entry is a Windows RGBQUAD structure . 4 . The image data itself . The OS/2 DIB images consist of : 1 . The same `` BITMAPFILEHEADER '' file header which identifies the file as a DIB file . This header also gives the total size of the image file , and the offset to the image data . 2 . A `` BITMAPCOREHEADER '' image header which specifies the image attributes . 3 . An optional palette of colors used by the image . Again , if this exists it may contain 2 , 16 , or 256 entries . Each entry is a Windows RGBTRIPLE structure . 4 . The image data itself . The Old Style image bitmap consists of : 1 . Either a BITMAPINFOHEADER or a BITMAPCOREHEADER . Which header type is determined by the first long integer ( DWORD ) value . 2 . An optional color palette . This palette may be composed of either Windows RGBQUAD structures ( if the header was a BITMAPINFOHEADER ) or Windows RGBTRIPLE structures ( if the header was a BITMAPCOREHEADER ) . 3 . The image data itself . CREATING DIB IMAGE FILES . Creating a DOS DIB image file consists of several straight forward steps . The headers need to be created and then written to the file . These header structures are defined in the MS Windows/3.0 `` windows.h '' include file . Palette information needs to be stored for images that are not 24-bit images . The five general steps are : 1 . Filling in the BITMAPFILEHEADER and the BITMAPINFOHEADER structures the basic image information . 2 . If the image is a 1-bit , 4-bit , or an 8-bit image , creating the color palette of RGBQUADS . 3 . Calculating the total file size and putting this information in March 15 , 1991 - 4 - the `` bfSize '' field of the BITMAPFILEHEADER . 4 . Calculating the offset to the image data from the start of the file , and putting this in the `` bfOffBits '' field of the BITMAPFILEHEADER . 5 . Writing to the file the BITMAPFILEHEADER , the BITMAPINFOHEADER , the color palette , and the image data ( in that order ) . The following sections describe structures in terms of MicroSoft C type- defined keywords . The following table describes these keywords for those not familiar with MicroSoft C. _______________________________________ | | | Type-defined keywords in MicroSoft C.| |______________________________________| | typedef | meaning | |_________|____________________________| | BYTE | unsigned character | | WORD | two byte unsigned integer | | DWORD | four byte unsigned integer| |_________|____________________________| March 15 , 1991 - 5 - THE BITMAPFILEHEADER This structure is defined in `` windows.h '' as : typedef struct tagBITMAPFILEHEADER { WORD bfType ; DWORD bfSize ; WORD bfReserved1 ; WORD bfReserved2 ; DWORD bfOffBits ; } BITMAPFILEHEADER ; The `` bfType '' field is the two ascii characters ' B ' and 'M ' . This serves to identify the file as a DIB image file . On an intel byte ordered machine ( IBM or a compatible ) , this constant can be formed in C as the quantity ( 'M ' < < 8 | ' B ' ) == 0x4d42 on an intel system . The `` bfSize '' field is the total size of the file . For our purposes this field is equal to : the size of the BITMAPFILEHEADER , plus the size of the BITMAPINFOHEADER , plus the number of entries in the color palette times the size of a RGBQUAD , plus the number of bytes of image data . If the image data is being written out in an uncompressed form , this value can be calculated ahead of time . Otherwise , this field needs to be filled in later . Both the `` bfReserved1 '' and the `` bfReserved2 '' fields are always set to zero . The `` bfOffBits '' field is set to the offset to the start of the image data from the start of the file . For our purposes , this field should be set to : the size of the BITMAPFILEHEADER , plus the size of the BITMAPINFOHEADER , plus the number of entries in the color palette times the size of a RGBQUAD . This works out because the image data is written write after the color palette if one exists . March 15 , 1991 - 6 - THE BITMAPINFOHEADER This structure is defined in `` windows.h '' as : typedef struct tagBITMAPINFOHEADER { DWORD biSize ; DWORD biWidth ; DWORD biHeight ; WORD biPlanes ; WORD biBitCount ; DWORD biCompression ; DWORD biSizeImage ; DWORD biXPelsPerMeter ; DWORD biYPelsPerMeter ; DWORD biClrUsed ; DWORD biClrImportant ; } BITMAPINFOHEADER ; The `` biSize '' field is set to the size of the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure itself . When reading the image file , this value is what is used to determine that the image contains a BITMAPINFOHEADER and not a BITMAPCOREHEADER . The `` biWidth '' field is the width of the image in image pixels . The `` biHeight '' field is the height of the image in image lines . The `` biPlanes '' field should always be set to 1 . This data is written out as if there was one color plane . The `` biBitCount '' field is the bit-depth of the image . This must be either 1 , 4 , 8 , or 24 , depending on the bit-depth of the image data . The `` biCompression '' field tells how the image data is compressed if it is compressed . DIB images support two forms of run-length encoding . However , I have never seen any images which use it , and do n't know yet how it works . Set this field to zero ( long zero , or 0L ) , to indicate that the data is not compressed . All subsequent fields of the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure may be set to zero . A requirement of the interpretting software that it be able to compute these fields as necessary from the previous information . The field which you might want to explicitly specify might be `` biClrUsed '' . For 4-bit and 8-bit images this field indicates that not all of the possible color entries are used and that the image contains `` biClrUsed '' colors . If you are using only 32 colors with an 8-bit image , then you may only want to save 32 of the possible 256 palette entries . Generally , set this field to zero . March 15 , 1991 - 7 - COLOR PALETTES Each entry of a color palette is a RGBQUAD structure . The RGBQUAD structure is defined in the `` windows.h '' include file as : typedef struct tagRGBQUAD { BYTE rgbBlue ; BYTE rgbGreen ; BYTE rgbRed ; BYTE rgbReserved ; } RGBQUAD ; The `` rgbReserved '' field is always zero . For each color used , the amount of Blue , Green , and Red are filled into the structure and the structure is written to the file . A value of zero in the `` rgbBlue '' , `` rgbGreen '' , or `` rgbRed '' fields indicates that that particular component does not contribute to the color composition . A value of 255 in any of these fields indicates that the component contributes fully to the color composition . IMAGE DATA There are three surprises about the ordering of image data in DIB image file . The creator of this format was determined to be creative , and certainly was . Within the image data , each line written out is padded to the next four byte quantity . So , if you had an 8-bit image which was only one pixel wide , you still have to write out four bytes for every image line . The number of bytes per line can be calculated as : bytes_per_line = ( width_in_pix * bit_depth + 31 ) / 32 * 4 ; -- -or , in terms of the fields of the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure -- - bytes_per_line = ( biWidth * biBitCount + 31 ) / 32 * 4 ; When writing out your image data , you must write it out bottom line first . The bottom line of the image as you would look at it on the screen is the first line of image data in the file . For 1-bit , 4-bit , and 8-bit images , information is written as you would expect . One bit images are padded eight pixels to a byte . Four bit images are padded two pixels to a byte . Eight bit images are written one pixel per byte . Twenty-four bit images are written three bytes per pixel . However , for 24-bit images the information must be written out in the order blue , green , red . While most image file formats write data out in March 15 , 1991 - 8 - an `` RGB '' ordering , a DIB image file writes the data out in an `` BGR '' ordering . SUMMARY This should provide enough information to create DIB images from applications such as scanners or for image exporting routines . If you find out any more about DIB images , please pass the information on to me so that I can modify this document accordingly . March 15 , 1991 -- Thomas B.

I do n't have any evidence against water from Lourdes curing MS -- I 'm sure there is anecdotal evidence that it does . Do you really think that in the absence of a double-blind study I should be indifferent to the hypothesis that water from Lourdes cures MS ? For what it 's worth , I know of only one double blind study of Nystatin for `` candida hypersensitivity syndrome . '' It was published in the New England Journal ( I think 1990 ) and showed no benefit on systemic symptoms ( though I think it reduced vaginal yeast infections , not surprisingly ) . As I recall , the yeast crowd had some major objections to the study , though I do n't remember what they were . -- David Rind rind @ enterprise.bih.harvard.edu

Assuming the fire was caused by lanterns and stoves being knocked about by the tanks pushing on the walls ( would shake a building pretty good ) perhaps they did n't flee because fleeing would have meant ENTERING the fire from the other side ? Like they were surrounded by the fire , and rubble , which finally ( combined with teargas , and combustion gasses ) overcame and enveloped them ?

As you 're no doubt aware , Phill , there are probably five or six different , mutually contradictory versions of the events in Waco on Feb. 28 all of which are from reputable news sources , ranging the the Associated Press to TIME to Newsweek . Some of the earliest reports issued by the AP were not at all flattering the to BATF , and produced some question as to who fired first . Now , for all I know , you were there to witness it . But I kind of doubt that . > Any government that allows tinpot dictators to set up shop and declare > a private state has drifted into anarchy .

The BATF , in a letter they 've been sending out to people , says both that they were ambushed because they lost the element of surprise , and that they went up and knocked on the door and had it slammed in their faces . It strikes *me* as kind of strange to rely on surprise to serve a warrant by knocking on the door . There are at least questions that need to be answered . > The paranoid assertion that the BATF fired first in an unprovoked > assault assumes that the BATF were on a death wish . This paranoid assertation was made by witnesses to the original assault who stated that the BATF initiated hostilities by throwing concussion grenades and reported by the Associated Press . > Had they > expected the B-D to be anything other than peacefull citizens who > would accept a search authorized by a court they would have turned up > in a tank and broken the door down on day one . Phill , the BATF were in a firefight with the BD for *forty-five* minutes . I find it hard to believe that if they were expecting peaceful citizens they *wouldn't* have shown up in live-stock trailers and would have retreated immediately . If they *were* expecting peacful citizens , why show up with over a hundred officers , some of which clearly visible on video to be carrying sub-machineguns , and *3* National Guard Helicopters ?

I am adding an event handler for StructureNotify to the TopLevelShell : XtAddEventHandler ( topLevel , StructureNotifyMask , False , configureCB , myData ) ; This works fine , and my callback is called whenever the window is resized or repositioned using the window manager ( mwm ) .

This goes along with our belief that if a person is > to marry at all it must be done on this earth ... [ deletions ] The problem with this view is that the topic under discussion in this passage *is* marriages that were performed on earth . Jesus ' words seem to me to indicate that He regards His response as the answer to their question about which earthly marriage would be valid after the resurrection . This being the case , the most straightforward interpretation , in my opinion , is that marriage does not exist in the next life because those who are raised are of a different nature than what we are now . Other- wise , why would Jesus offer `` but are like the angels in heaven '' as a contrast to the idea of the resurrected marrying and being given in marriage ? We do not have angel-like natures now , but someday we shall , and when we do , our earthly marriages will be irrelevant . Or at least , that 's what I think Jesus is saying about the post-resurrection validity of marriages performed on earth . Your mileage may vary . : ) - Mark

There would be some point to doing long-term monitoring of things like particles and fields , not to mention atmospheric phenomena . However , there is no particular plan to establish any sort of monitoring network . To be precise , there is no particular plan , period . This is a large part of the problem . In this context , it 's not surprising that unexciting but useful missions like this get short shrift at budget time . The closest approach to any sort of long-term planetary monitoring mission is the occasional chance to piggyback something like this on top of a flashier mission like Galileo or Cassini . > How about a mission ( unmanned ) to Pluto to stay in orbit and record things > around and near and on Pluto ... It is most unlikely that there is much happening on Pluto that would be worth monitoring , and it is a prohibitively difficult mission to fly without new propulsion technology ( something the planetary community has firmly resisted being the guinea pigs for ) . The combined need to arrive at Pluto within a reasonable amount of time , and then kill nearly all of the cruise velocity to settle into an orbit , is beyond what can reasonably be done with current ( that is , 1950s-vintage ) propulsion . > It could do some scanning of not only Pluto , but also of the solar system , > objects near and aaroundpluto , as well as SETI and looking at the galaxy > without having much of the solar system to worry about..

Sorry , but this is a red herring . Are you contending that the `` mountain of forms '' are processed by Blue Cross ? Having had Blue Cross insurance both as a government employee and as an employee of a private corporation , I saw no difference between the two sets of forms . Moreover , the administrative costs associated with Medicare/Medicaid , the two primary forms of `` government '' insurance are considerably lower than the average for private insurance companies . ( 5 % versus 14 % -16 % ) . If you have any evidence that Blue Cross bears a heavier burden in insuring government employees than private employees , post it . Otherwise , try to stick to factual assertions . > > > And as the original post implied , it is private insurers in the US > > whose administrative costs are significantly higher than the administrative > > costs of tax-supported health care systems in Canada and elsewhere . > > Only those that remain paper-bound and refuse to standardize . Well now , that 's an interesting defense of the `` free enterprise '' system . Are you contending that it is government intervention that prevents private insurance companies from `` standardizing ? '' In fact , it is true that some of the red-tape burden stems from the lack of standardization among the 1500 or so private insurers in the US , but it 's a little difficult to understand how this is anything other than '' free enterprise '' at work . By the way , Barron 's , the bible of Wall Street , this week admitted that administrative costs were significantly lower in Canada because `` ... .a single-payer system is always cheaper ... '' .

How about you read them in context , taking into consideration the times and places in which they were written ; the local customs and pagan rituals ; what the surrounding verses are talking about and how they interact with the rest of the Bible . There are many issues in the Bible that are argued , and can be argued successfullly from both sides of an issue . Some examples that come to mind are Gifts of the Spirit when the Rapture will occur ( pre or post tribulation ) how people should be baptized to name a few . I have found nothing in scripture that condemns me , or anyone else , for having a monogamous relationship with the person whom I love , even if we are the same sex . I 'm sorry if I am coming across as heated . It 's just that the Lord has been so dear to me the last several years and I 'm tired of hearing this same old thing from people who believe what their told rather than finding out for themselves . Check it out for yourself . Invite the Holy Spirit to guide you . If I weren't confident of this I would n't invite you to do this . God Bless Loisc

This is *precisely* why they were considered America 's team . Even ( especially ? ) when they were bad , you could see most of the Braves games on cable . You could do that for the Cubs as well , but the Braves had better camerawork , better announcers ( what would you rather listen to -- Harry discuss the game , or Skip and Pete discuss motoball ? ) , and teams that were n't *too* much worse . Because of TBS , the Braves had a lot of fans outside of Georgia . At home in Kentucky , even though we were much closer to Cincinnati there was as many Braves fans as Reds fans , even in 1990 .

I can understand your anger about the German audience . I mean , it was the Finnish team they played and they were taking advantage of the ridiculous penalties the Canadien ref called in the last period . The Germans got a match penalty and a 10 minutes misconduct for practically nothing and seconds after that the German goalie got two minutes for `` delay of game '' for a shot that was deflected and went into the crowd . The resulting 5:3 skating advantage lead to the deciding goal at a point , when the Germans were starting to come up strong . I am also sick of the nationalism that is going on in German sports events . If you watch for example a tennis Davis Cup match the players are often not able to play for minutes , because the crowd is so obnoxious . But I have to admit that this kind of nationalism is as strong or even stronger in most other countries ( you should go to the US and watch the way they present the Olympics on television ; or the soccer crowds in England ; or the Finnish spectators at nordic skiing events ... .. ) . I mean it makes me sick to see all this nationalism all over the world and I would rather see the best team/player win and get cheared at . I do not mind if my favorite team looses to somebody that is better or plays more attractive and I have to admit that in most sports the German national site is not my favorite team to watch ( the German soccer team is boring to watch , for example ) . But , reading the above posting , I think that you are on the same level as these crowds you are criticizing . It is easy to talk of ( nearly all ) Germans as Nazis and nationalists ; thats the kind of propaganda that all ultraconservative people use against Germany . It is true that there is a great danger of re-arising nationalism in Germany but from my experience most of the people ( at least of the people that i know ) also regard this as a big threat and are trying to demonstrate this attitude now . Why ca n't we just look at people as human beeings and not try to put them into drawers corresponding to their nationality ( eg . all Russians are Communists ; all Americans are Capitalists ; all Germans are Nazis , all Fins are hanging around beeing drunk on ferries ... ) . In my opinion , your comment shows the narrowness of your mind and that you do n't seem to be different from the Nazis you are talking about .

I 'd like to get your comments on a question that has been on my mind a lot : What morals/ethics apply to dreams and out-of-body incidents ? In normal dreams , you ca n't control anything , so obviously you are n't morally responsible for your actions . But if you can contrive to control the action in dreams or do an OOBE , it seems like a morality applies . Now , there seem to be 3 alternatives : 1 ) Dreams and OOBEs are totally mental phenomena . In this case no morality applies beyond what might be called 'mental hygiene ' , that is , not trying to think about anything evil , or indulgining in overly sexy or violent thoughts . 2 ) Dreams and OOBEs have a reality of their own ( i.e . are 'another plane ' ) Evidence for this is that often dreams and OOBEs are sometimes done in common by more than one person . A mark of objective fact is that > 1 people report the same objective experience . In this case , the same interpersonal morality/ethics applies in dreams and OOBEs as does in waking life . 3 ) Like ( 2 ) , but here we assume that though the dreeam and OOBE environs have a real existence , a different moral/ethics apply there , and no ( or maybe different ) moral laws apply there . So ... There it is . Is one of these cases the truth , or does anyone know of another alternative ? respond by post or email . thanks very much *dt* ======================================================== .

'' > > If the waco wackos truly had grenade launchers and rocket launchers , why > were n't they used against the armored vehicles that attacked their house ? > All the media stated was that small arms ( ie , ineffective ) fire was used > against them . I noticed that too . Special agent ( asshole actually ) Ricks stated that David Koresh had `` explosives that could blow up an armored vehicle 40 feet into the air . '' It looked like to me that the BDs had plenty of opportunity to use these explosives -- -provided that they had them in the first place . For example , when one of the tanks was injecting CS gas into the ranch house ( yes ranch house ; the BDs were n't living in a fortress ) they could have easily destroyed or disabled that tank because it was idling there for a considerable length of time . So , why didn't they do this ? Could it be that they did n't have any explosives or similar munitions ? I just do n't buy what the ATF and FBI have been saying . Hopefully , the truth will come out . Here 's something noteworthy : after the fire had been burning for some time an explosion occurred -- -just *one* explosion . The media said that this was some of the explosives that the BDs posessed going off . I do n't think this was the case . My brother and I noticed that this so-called `` explosion '' resembled a plume of propane gas being ignited . We figure that this is what it was because of how the `` explosion '' looked and sounded . Obviously , it was n't due to something like TNT , dynamite , or C4 . I have seen a propane explosion before ... the explosion in the ranch house greatly resembled this . Also , I noticed something that looked like a propane tank in the charred ruble the next day . Is n't it curious that the ATF was n't very forthcoming about how the four officers got killed ? Many weeks had gone by before they stated that some of the officers had been killed and/or wounded by grenades thrown by the BDs . Earlier , when someone asked one of the spokespersons about whether or not an autopsy had been performed on the slain agents , they said that an autopsy had been done but THEY WERE N'T READY TO RELEASE THE FINDINGS . Now why is this ? Does the ATF have something to hide ? Perhaps those four agents were killed by friendly fire . What is the cause of death exactly ? NO ONE HAS EVER SAID WHAT IT IS . What is certain is this : ATF agents *did* throw grenades into the compound . As a matter of fact , Mr. Koresh handed his lawyer a grenade body during one of the lawyer 's visits to the compound . Later on the lawyer gave the grenade body ( I do n't know if it was a dud or a spent one btw ) to the ATF . How much do you want to bet that this grenade will mysteriously disappear ? At this point in time the only people we know who had grenades was the ATF agents . Would n't it be a shocker if the no one ever found any evidence of grenades , rockets , or explosives in the rubble ? The ATF would sure have egg on their face then . Note that the ATF is doing the *initial* sweep of the rubble . The FBI and the Texas Rangers wo n't investigate until the ATF is done . This looks like a perfect opportunity for the ATF to make sure that others `` find '' what they want for them to `` find '' if you know what I mean . I 'm probably being a little paranoid here but if I am I have could reason to be . Recall that several weeks had gone by before anyone said that the BDs had used grenades . Also recall that early on the ATF had *denied* that their agents used grenades on the BDs . Someone is lying here .

Carry and use a firearm in many parts of the country ( certainly the parts I live in ) , and expect , at the very least , to have an awful lot of explaining to do .

In a few other parts of our society , handguns are banned or so restricted as to be practically unavailable to the law- abiding citizen for self-defense outside the home . Funny , though , how the criminals in such places continue to have a lush supply of guns and no compunctions about using them . IMHO , you do n't need to be either a political philosopher or a crime victim to realize that there 's a flaw in the gun- grabbers ' logic . Agreed .

Thoughts on Game 1 : ================== The Flames played horribly in dropping the first game of their series with Los Angeles 6-3 on Sunday afternoon . They seemed more interested in throwing big hits than in scoring goals . They physically dominated the Kings , but that was the only area they dominated in . The game plan was to rush the net and try and take advantage of a young , inexperienced L.A. defence and the shaky Kings goaltending , but those plans fell by the wayside while the Flames conducted a steady march to the penalty box . Particularily stupid was Theoren Fleury taking a five minute major and a game misconduct for slamming Warren Rychel 's face into the dasher while Rychel was on his knees . Goaltender Mike Vernon played well and could not really be faulted for the loss , despite his well-publicized poor record in afternoon games . He got very little support from his defence in clearing the front of the net and sweeping away rebounds . In fact , Marty McSorley 's goal actually went in off Chris Dahlquist 's skate in front of the net . Thoughts on Game 2 : ================== The Flames came back strong in the second game , evidently aware of the potentially fatal consequences of losing both the first two games on home ice . The first period was fairly even , with the edge going to the Kings . But Calgary came out strong in the second period and simply dominated the Kings , scoring five goals to take a lead they never relinquished en route to a 9-4 win . The deciding factors in this game were faceoffs and special teams . Calgary dominated on faceoffs as they did in Game 1 , but they were able to make better use of the won faceoffs in this game than they did in the first one . Calgary also went 3-for-5 on the powerplay while L.A. only went 1-for-8 and gave up a shorthanded goal to Joel Otto . L.A. 's powerplay goal also came late in the game with the outcome already decided . The Kings ' powerplay failed them when they needed it most , in the 1st and 2nd periods . The Flames lost RW Greg Paslawski with a suspected shoulder injury when he was leveled by Alexei Zhitnik right after scoring Calgary 's 7th goal . Charlie Huddy left the game for the Kings with a groin injury . The game was marred by stupidity in the last minute . First , Craig Berube of Calgary took a five-minute major for fighting plus a game misconduct for instigating when he went after Tony Granato for no apparent reason . Granato drew a minor for some strange reason . ( Turtling perhaps ) . This was followed 30 seconds later by Warren Rychel drawing a major , minor , and game misconduct for hitting Frank Musil in the face with his stick and then instigating a fight . Musil got a fighting major for some similarily strange reason . Hardy and Yawney went toe-to-toe and both got double minors . ( Gregson thought that Musil turtling amounted to fighting , but that Yawney and Hardy throwing punches at each other was just roughing ? Where 's this guy from ... .. ) Upcoming games : ============== Friday April 23 , at L.A. Sunday April 25 , at L.A. Tuesday April 27 , home to L.A. Thursday April 29 , at L.A.

Their navy is entirely made of F-USSR vessels . Their airforce ( not including stuff captured from Kuwait which I am not as sure about ) , does n't include any US equipment . Their missiles are all non-US . Their tanks are almost all soviet , with about 100 French tanks ( older ones ) . The only US stuff in the Iraqi arsenal is a few M113s . Those were not sold to Iraq .

No , what it means is that I , like a majority of environmental scientists/researchers , agree that El Nino/La Nina and the Southern Oscillations are the systems involoved in that climatic phenomena categorized by humans as a drought ( 1988 ) . Furthermore , in response to an earlier message , the 1992 U.S. est . output of sulfur dioxide ( 20 mill . tons ) was equivalent to the entire output by the recent eruption of Mt . Pinautubo ( Sp. ) . Currently world carbon dioxide levels set at approx . 360 ppm , in the past 120,000 years it has never gone above 280 ( this info was found using ice core samples from the joint French/Russian/U.S . Vostok project ) . Furthermore , the background emmisions of chlorine compounds into the atmoshpere is about 0.6 ppb annually , it now sits at 3.5 . This OVERWHELMING data/info is found in the World Resources doc . published by Oxford University . The ozone hole in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres keeps getting bigger and stickin ' around longer whilst skeptics ponder how wrong or corrupt all this data from government and international scientific institutions is .

A search for illegally held weapons ( IF there were any , no evidence yet produced to this effect ) does not justify firing into a house with women and children , either .

This is true of ANY answer to a call for help from a fire department by ANY citizen . Since fire departments do answer calls that `` deprive resources that might be needed elsewhere '' it is not a valid reason for not calling them .

An axiomatic datum lends itself to rational analysis , what you say here is a an often refuted fallacy . Have a look at the discussion of the axiom of choice .

From : REXLEX @ fnal.fnal.gov Subject : ARSENOKOITAI : NT Meaning of Organization : FNAL/AD/Net Lines : 84 This week , many of you have asked about my earlier postings on OT , NT and Intertestiment exegesis on the homosexual issue . I have refered you to the FAQ files , which I find out , no longer contains them . They are too long for me to mail to each of you , each article , but will try to get them back on the FAQ file . Because of the renewed interest on this subject , I will type , with permission , an article by James DeYoung . I think it is one of the best articles that I've read todate from the conservative position . I ca n't post it all at once , so it will come piece meal and not daily . After I 'm done retyping the entire article , I will make it available for the FAQ file . Talk to clh . Also , for those who ca n't get through to me , you may try one of these : REXLEX @ FNAL.FNAL.GOV LEXREX @ ALMOND.FNAL.GOV Loren Senders @ ADMAIL.FNAL.GOV THE SOURCE AND NT MEANING OF ARSENOKOITAI , WITH IMPLICATIONS FOR CHRISTIAN ETHICS AND MINISTRY James B. DeYoung Professor of New Testament Western Conservative Baptist Seminary Portland , Oregon Traditional interpretation of arsenokoitai ( `` homosexuals '' ) in 1 Cor 6:9 and 1 Tim 1:10 refers to sexual vice between people of the same sex , specifically homosexualitiy . Some restrict the term 's meaning to `` active male prostititute , '' but stronger evidence supports a more general translation , namely `` homosexuals . '' More recently the definition `` homosexual '' has been opposed on clutural and linguistic grounds , the claim being that the term '' homosexuals '' is anachronistic . In addition , criticism of the traditional rendering says the term today includes celibate homophiles , excludes heterosexuals who engage in homosexual acts , and includes female homosexuals . A concern for acts instead of the modern attention to desires was the only factor in the ancient world . The foregoing oppositition to the translation of arsenokoitai by `` homosexuals '' has a number of debilitating weaknesses . Finally , this study argues that Paul coined the term arsenokoitai , deriving it from the LXX of Lev 20:12 ( cf . 18:22 ) and using it for homosexual orientation and behavior , the latter of which should be an occasion for church discipline ( I Cor 5-6 ) and legislation in society ( 1 Tim 1:8-11 ) . ************************************* INTRODUCTION Coincident with the rise of the gay rights movement in recent years has been an increasing focus on the biblical statements regarding homosexuality or sodomy . As part of this focus , the meaning of the term arsenokoitai , used twice by the apostle Paul ( 1 Cor 6:9 , I Tim 1:10 ) , has received vigorous scrutiny . This issue is particularly crucial to contemporary society since so much of modern ethics is shaped by biblical statements . More particularly , the concern over gay rights and the place of gays or homosexuals in the church and in society require the resolution of biblical interpretation . This study of historical , linguistic , and literary matters will survey and evalutate recent proposals for the meaning of arsenokoitai and present evidence to point to a resolution . Several writers and their positions represent the modern debate on this word . Three authors , Bailey , Boswell , and Scroggs , have provoked considerable discussion and significantly encouraged the wider acceptance of the homosexual lifestyle in society , in the church , and in the ministry . Footnotes : _______________________ 1 . For convenience sake , the term `` homosexual '' is used to encompass both same-sex orientation and same-sex behavior . The meaning of this term is one of the main considerations of this study . 2 . These times are differnt from just over a century ago . Then P Fairbairn ( Pastoral Epistles [ Edinburg , 1874 ) 891 ) could write of arsenokoitai thit it is a `` term for which fortunately our language has no proper equivalent . '' Unknowingly he thereby touched upon the basis for the contemporary debate and study . THe present writer endorses the Pauline authorship of the Pastoral Epistles on the basis of internal and external evidence ( see Donald Guthrie , New Testament Introduction , [ 4th ed ; 1990 ] 621-649 , for an extensive discussion and citation of supporters of the Pauline authorship ) . 3 . For example , see Scroggs ' influence on M. Olson , `` Untangling the Web , '' The Other Side ( April 1984 ) : 24-29 . For a study suggesting a further prohibition of homosexuality in the OT , see A. Phillips , `` Unconvering the Father 's Skirt , '' VT 30/1 ( Jan , 1980 ) 38-43 . For a bibliography of other sources dealing with arsenokoitai , see the Wisondisc Religion Indexes ( NY : H. Wison Co. , 1987 ) .

Ordinary massage is intended to make a person feel better , especially if they have muscular or joint problems . But -- like chiropracty -- there are some practitioners who take the technique to a far extreme , invoking what seems to me to be quack science to justify their technique . In the case of massage , there is a technique called `` deep abdominal massage '' in which the masseur is literally attempting to massage the intestines ! The notion is that undigested food adheres to the inner surface of the intestines and putrifies , releasing poisons which cause various disease syndromes . By this vigorous and painful procedure , it is alleged that these deposits can be loosened up and passed out . I just ca n't believe this idea has any truth behind it ! The human intestine is not a New York City sewer pipe ! And even if it were , you eat half of a small box of Triscuits , and there ai n't gon na be nothin ' sticking to the inner surface of your intestine : - )

Back to the engine if I remember right it was a 1600cc V4 and that thing could haul , we could fill it with equipment and up to 8 people and it went like a bat out of hell , of course there were no pollution controls on the engine and the gas was leaded and higher octane than we get now .

I do n't think so , not from what I heard . He lived > ONE DAY of suffering and died . If the wages of sin is the above paragraph , then > JESUS DID N'T PAY FOR OUR SINS , DID HE ? This is something I 've always found a little curious . I 've never quite understood the trinity thing . On the one hand , Jesus is supposed to be God incarnate . But , at the same time , he is God 's son `` For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son '' . First question is , if Jesus was God in human form , how could he really be God 's son ? If the Holy Ghost `` planted the seed '' in Mary , so to speak , then it seems that Jesus ' relationship to God would be the equivalent to the human father/son relationship . While a son might inherit alot of the father 's qualities , he is not the father . They are still two separite entities . To try and say that a son is the same person as the father is obviously wrong . In that case , Jesus and God are n't the same . On the other hand , if their relationship is n't the same as the human father/son relationship , but Jesus is actually God incarnate , then he 's not really God 's son and he never was . He 's just God manifesting himself as Jesus . At least , this is how I 'm seeing it . Can someone who is more knowledgeable about the trinity enlighten us ? Getting back to the original question , what is the great price that Jesus paid to redeem our sins ? Was it dying on the cross ? Since Jesus knew that he would rise again in 3 days and then ascend back to heaven , I have a hard time seeing how this is considered paying such a great price for humanity . His earthly body may have been killed , but then , so what ? He suffered a few hours of physical pain , but then , there has been many a human who has suffered a great deal more . The fact that Jesus was God 's only begotten son does n't seem to me to have much meaning since God can beget as many sons as he wants to . Jesus being the only one was simply a matter of choice . I suspect that these questions will be very offensive to many Christians on this net . To those people , please accept my sincere apologies . It is not my intention to offend or to trivialize Christ . But , I do believe these are legitimate questions and I am genuinely curious . [ Note that the Trinity and Incarnation have to be looked at together . First , your reading of the Virgin Birth is an uncommon one . ( In this group , it 's dangerous to say that no one believes something . ) You seem to be suggesting the Jesus is God 's son in a physical sense , with the Holy Spirit as Father and Mary as Mother . I consider that terrible heresy , though some people react less violently . The Virgin Birth says that Jesus ' birth is God 's responsibility . But it doesn't imply that God 's sperm was involved . Indeed one ( though by no means the only ) speculation is that God used Joseph 's genetic material . Second , Jesus is in some sense doubly indirect from the Father . In a Trinitarian context , the term Son refers to the eternal Logos , who is a part of God . The Son did n't come into existence with Jesus ' birth . Jesus is the incarnation of the Son . So his sonness isn't specifically a result of being incarnated . Rather , it 's the Son who was incarnated . -- clh ]

Charlie Brett 's suggestion -- buy one of the disposable flash cameras , use the film , then take the thing apart -- is a good one . Note , though , that you wo n't get a particularly precise voltage out of such a thing , and it may be a single-point design that wo n't adapt well to off-nominal operation . The things are easy to dismantle . The key piece of information is that when you advance the film on one of them , you are winding it *into* the film cassette -- it is unwound from the cassette in the factory , when the camera is made . So no darkroom is needed for dismantling . It's standard film , so just take the cassette in for processing . All the camera-store people do when you bring in one of the disposables is rip it apart , toss the film cassette into the to-be-processed bin , and throw the battery in one trashcan and the rest of the camera in another . If you take it apart yourself , you get an AA alkaline battery ( still with a fair bit of life in it ) and all kinds of little bits and pieces from the camera . I expect you could even re-load and re-use the camera if you were really determined . -- SVR4 resembles a high-speed collision | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology between SVR3 and SunOS . - Dick Dunn | henry @ zoo.toronto.edu utzoo ! henry

Look at the history of this group . David Koresh has been arrested ? twice ? by local police . Both times , he accepted the arrest warrant and went peacefully . So , the feds decide to arrest him . How do they choose to arrest a person with a record of peaceful obedience under arrest ? They throw a concussion grenades at his building . In addition , we KNOW that we 've been lied to . Initially , we were told that they suspected him of molesting children and having several wives . But these are NOT ATF offenses , were they ? So they changed their story , several times . And the original warrant is STILL sealed . And we were told about the rockets and ammunition they had ... but did anyone notice any ammo exploding in the fire ? They claimed that Koresh had n't left the compound in months ... but people in town report seeing him just a week before the raid . How would I have handled it differently ? Well , first , I have n't seen any evidence that the BDs did anything wrong . There 's a sealed warrant , and a collection of stories which keep changing about what they did . So I might not have done ANYTHING . OK. Now , supposing that I know what the BDs are being arrested for . Well , they 've got a history of accepting arrests ... so , I send officers to the door with a warrant . Wearing bulletproof vests . Covered from a distance by sharpshooters . Now , there 's no good reason to suspect that these people will do anything , right ? Why didn't anyone TRY serving a warrant ? OK . Going further . They refuse the warrant . It becomes necessary to raid . You plan a raid . You hear an hour before that there was a leak , and they know your coming . SO what do you do ? Well , change your plans , right ? Nope ... they go ahead with it anyone ... including sending in unprotected men to break into the place . It was idiotic . I do n't know what I would have ended up doing . But that original raid should NEVER have happened . The shit that came later should NEVER have happened .

The cabling is not an issue as long as pin 1 goes to pin 1 goes to pin 1 . No twisting or swapping on an IDE cable . Be sure of pin 1 on all three components - do not make assumptions ( guesses are ok but assumptions are bad ) . 4 . If the cable and jumpers are correct , and the CMOS setup is correct , then you may have to do an FDISK followed by a high level format .

Typical response : lack of logic . Define 'deviant ' : someone who deviates from the normal . Ok , so far . Define 'normal ' : erm , umm . If you define yourself as normal then it is for you to prove that you are ( within limits , which then brings in the question , what are the limits ? For you we may have to broaden them to other 's intolerance ; - ) ) 'normal ' . Difficult to prove . From what you have posted it must follow that ` normal ` to you means someone without compassion and a sense of justice . But it does look as if you went to the Clayton school of logic , does n't it ? | > | > > how disparaging you are towards political minorities , | > | > Sexual deviants do not comprise a `` political minorit [ y ] '' . Again an astounding lack of logic ! Wow ! You must define what you say such that everyone agrees . Here you have used the phrase `` sexual deviant '' . How in the hell do you define that ? As someone who does something sexually that _you_ do n't ? By this definition you most probably mean the majority of the planet . How do you know that your next door neighbour does n't like custard to be spread over his genetalia then have it licked off by his wife ? Is this sexual deviancy ? How do we know that you do n't like something sexually which others may find repulsive ? Is having sex doggy fashion a sexual deviancy ? Please be more specific , and where you do , back up your claims . Or I may have to go to hospital due to laughing too much at yours and Clayton 's postings . Secondly , if we assume for the moment that the phrase 'sexual deviant ' means such people as homosexuals , bisexuals & c. ( basically everyone you do n't like ) , I think that your phrase `` do not comprise a ` political minorit [ y ] ` `` ( why the brackets ? ) is a non-sequiteur . Gay groups exist which lobby their governments . That is a fact . Prove it false . Hence they are a politial group . You state that they are not a political minority . Are they therefore a political majority ? I think you boobed really big on this one .

I agree that the desire for beauty is valid , but I think your desire to impose your vision of beauty is not . You mention the age-old desire to somehow get up there , but ignore the beauty of the actual achievment of that vision . You mention the beauty of a very dark sky , not impeded by the effects of humans , but ignore the beauty of the as-dark-as-can-be sky that is only visible from space , a vision that we , or at least , our descendents , may one day be able to see , in part , because of efforts that others call ugly . One day , I hope , humans will be able to look out , not upon half the heavens , with only nature-creted lights , but upon all of the heavens , with no lights . If advertising in space can help us reach that goal , it is no less beautiful for the way we reach it , than the 'pristine ' sky of yesteryear ( or yester-century ) , which is totally unreachable . One of the original conceptions of beauty in wetsern sculpture was a human form , in the effort of striving to reach a goal . I do n't think there 's any reason to believe that modernity has changed that , just because it has changed the way we strive . BTW , there are places that people have n't fouled .

Organization : Tattooed Love Boys Lines : 60 Distribution : world NNTP-Posting-Host : glare.cisco.com Ok , so in my ongoing search for a sport utility , here 's the latest ; Toyota 4runner : Small . Small Small Small . The interior of this vehical is impossible for a large person . Too bad ; it would have been the winner otherwise . Nissan Pathfinder : Very low ceiling . My head hit the roof , Fun on bumps , no ? Also has a cheap-looking interior . Isuzu Trooper : Class act . This is a really , really nice vehical . Very comfortable , handled ok. Has really cool grab handles EVERYWHERE . But it 's huge , and the engine is a bit too small for it 's bulk ; also the manual shift is weird and kind of awkward . I 'd buy this if it were $ 3k cheaper or 10 '' shorter . But at this size and for this price , no . I kept picturing trying to park in in San Francisco . No Thanks . Chevy Blazer : Cheap looking . Small . Not as small as the Toyota and Nissan , but still too small . Ford Explorer : This is no sports car , and it 's certainly not for the serious off roader . But it 's big enough to be comfortable without being as huge and heavy as the trooper . It 's engine has plenty of power for everyday driving , though it would be nice if it had a *bit* more . The automatic tranny is pretty nice ; head and shoulders above my '90 mazda MPV . The steering is not as tight as I 'd like , but it 's acceptable . The two door has easy-to-enter back seats ( Easier to get into , in fact , than the driver 's seat of the 4runner ! ) and with a 10 '' shorter wheelbase and the easier availability of a manual tranny , ( Yes , I 'm a manual shift biggot , I admit it ... ) it 's the one I 'm thinking of buying . So , that said , is there anyone out there who has one of these and hates it ? Anyone had any major problems ? Heard any horror stories ? Also , any reason to buy the ford over the mazda Navajo , both being essentially the same vehical ?

Silly excuses such as the ones above and those such as , `` How can u trust science , science was invented by man ! `` , only goes to further show the weakness of their religion . In my country where xtainity was and still is rapidly growing , xtains never try to convert people by appealing to their brains or senses . They know it would be a fruitless act , given the irrational nature of their faith . They would wait until a person is in distress , then they would comfort him/her and addict them to their emotional opium .

But since it explicitly includes both the general welfare and defense > in Article I , Section 8 , I guess you 'll grant that botha are constitutional > functions . Right ? James Madison , Federalist Paper 41 : `` It has been urged and echoed , that the power `` to lay and collect taxes , duties , imposts , and excises , to pay the debts , and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States , '' amounts to an unlimited commission to exercise every power which may be alleged to be necessary for the common defense or general welfare ... `` No stronger proof could be given of the distress under which these writers labor for objections , than their stooping to such a misconstruction .

But what color can the objection have , when a specification of the objects alluded to by these general terms immediately follows , and is not even separated by a longer pause than a semicolon ? ... Nothing is more natural nor common than first to use a general phrase , and then to explain and qualify it by a recital of particulars . -- cdt @ rocket.sw.stratus.com -- If you believe that I speak for my company , OR cdt @ vos.stratus.com write today for my special Investors ' Packet ...

Why it does not appear to be available in the US , I do n't know . It 's manufactured in Montreal .

EDT Q Mr. President , President Havel is here for the Holocaust Museum opening , and you toured the museum last night . All this focus on the Holocaust , how does that weigh on your decision- making process as far as Bosnia is concerned ? THE PRESIDENT : Well , I think the Holocaust is the most extreme example the world has ever known of ethnic cleansing . And I think that even in its more limited manifestations , it 's an idea that should be opposed . You could n't help thinking about that . That 's not to compare the two examples . They 're not identical ; everyone knows that . But I think that the United States should always seek an opportunity to stand up against -- at least to speak out against inhumanity . Q Sir , how close are you to a decision on more sanctions on Bosnia ? THE PRESIDENT : Well , of course , we 've got the U.N. vote . Ambassador Albright was instrumental in the U.N. vote to strengthen the sanctions and they are quite tough . And we now are putting our heads at the business of implementing them and looking at what other options we ought to consider . And I do n't have anything else to say , except to tell you that I spent quite a bit of time on it and will continue to over the next several days . Q Following your meeting today , sir , are you any closer to some sort of U.S. military presence there ? THE PRESIDENT : I have not made any decisions . * * * Q President Clinton , why have you decided to meet with Mr. Havel ? THE PRESIDENT : Well , I 'm just honored that he would come and see me . I 'm glad he 's here in the United States for the dedication of the Holocaust Museum . He is a figure widely admired in our country and around the world , and a very important person in Europe , and a very important person to the United States . So I 'm hoping that we 'll have a chance to talk about the new Czech republic and what kinds of things we can do together to support the causes we believe in . END5:05 P.M. EDT

I was simply observing that as a non-Jew , I am not in that community which might be bound by such a decision ( I do n't know much about the Council of Jamnia , but I have heard that it is not well-attested historically ) . 'Faithless ' has nothing to do with it , and I prefer not to speculate about motives . > As early > as 150 AD , St. Justin had already accused the Jews of mutilating the > Canon of Scripture by their removal of certain books . I wish the Dialogue_with_Trypho were a real transcript of a real dialogue , , but I think it a fictional effect on Justin 's part .

Is this the principle : 'Any ( BC ) text not quoted by Christ can not be counted as Scripture ' ? Think well about this- Job , Ruth ... ? I wrote : These is a logically invalid *a priori* . Besides , we are talking about OT texts- which in many parts are superceded by the NT ( in the Xtian view ) . Would not this same principle exclude _Ecclesiastes_ ? This principle can not be consistently applied . Dave W. answers : > I have to reject your argument here . The Spirit speaks with one > voice , and he does not contradict himself . Meaning what ? Do you affirm the principle ( that the D.c 's can be excluded since they contain 'false doctrine ' ) or do you deny it ? If affirmed ( as is implied in your statement ) how does one determine that doctrine X is false ? Do you affirm every teaching in _Ecclesiastes_ ? > The ultimate test of canonicity is whether the words are inspired > by the Spirit , i.e. , God-breathed . It is a test which is more > guided by faith than by reason or logic . If so , it may be a test that can not be applied . The Orthodox faithfully believe that Psalm 151 is canonical . How can my faith say 'Not ! ' ? All I hear here is the *a priori* I mentioned before . > The deutero-canonical books were added much later in the church's > history . This is contrary to fact . > They do not have the same spiritual quality as the > rest of Scripture . Can this be elevated to a principle ? How is 'spiritual quality' measured ? I 'll take the 'spiritual quality ' of most of Sirach over Joshua or Chronicles , any day . > I do not believe the church that added these > books was guided by the Spirit in so doing . What can I say ? You believe what you believe- I 'm asking for a consistency check . I do n't see that the books were added- in any construction this formulation begs the question . No one can validly ask me to 'have faith ' that these books are noncanonical . Dave Davis , ddavis @ ma30.bull.com These are my opinions & activities alone QOTD : '' Christianity is not a doctrine , not , I mean , a theory about what has happened and will happen to the human soul , but a description of something that actually takes place in a human life . For ` consciousness of sin ' is a real event , and so are despair and salvation through faith . Those who speak of such things ( Bunyan , for instance ) are simply describing what has happened to them , whatever anyone may want to say about it . '' -- Ludwig Wittgenstein

Well , it would require generating an incredibly large magnetic field to repel the Earth 's magnetic field ( as a magnet can repel another magnet ) . Of course , this force only works in one direction , and the magnetic field generated has to be unimaginably powerful . Magnetic repulsion drops off as 1/r^3 , and the earth 's magnetic field on the surface is already very weak .

The VL-IDE Adapter can be much faster then the normal IDE , it depends on the drive you use and the board you use . I am using a NoName VL-IDE I/O Contr . it is tested under coretest with 2.000 kb/s using a cheap Seagate 3196 and nearly 4000 kb/s using a WD-Caviar 2340 , you have figure out the jumper setting on the controller to get reliable diskaccess , fastest setting gets 4600 kb/s under Coretest but does not work reliable . You have to shadow the adapter BIOS to get the fast speed . I haven´t used a VL-IDE-Cache controller yet , but it might speed up twice . dieter -- Dieter Fritzsche dieter @ dischw.toppoint.de Maehlsweg 32 , D-2300 Kiel 17 , Germany Master of the WOM Tel . : +49 431 362705 ( Voice ) FAX\BOX : +49 431 361437 ZyXEL-V.fast-Waffle/FAX compuserve 100060,654

However , it did n't help the problem . I 've also identified that when the machine boots ( and the drive seeks for a boot disk ) , the head movement during this process is now approximately half the length of the original time .

This is sci.med , not alt.sex . Secondly , how absolutely bogus to assume that `` American 's are just too hung up on the penis ... .blah , blah '' . I think most American 's do n't care about anything so comlicated as that . They just think it `` looks nicer '' . Ask a few of them and see what response you get . Others still opt for circumcision due to religious traditions and beliefs . Some think it is easier to clean . Still others do it because `` Daddy was '' . Dont ' be so naive as to think American 's are afraid of sexuality . My son is not circumcised , and I can vouch for the argument that it is more difficult to keep clean than a circumcised kids ' . Not so much that the foreskin is difficult to pull back ( it is n't ) but because my son does n't want to wait long enough for a thorough check for smega or misplaced feces . So , many times it just gets a once over dab . It worries me that he might get an infection due to his lack of cooperation . I am sure , however , that he will be able to handle cleaning under the foreskin himself once he is old enough . Until , there is always the decision at each diaper change ... is this the time to clean or can we wait till next time .

From : hardy @ esdd460a.erim.org ( Russ Hardy ) Subject : Mary and Idols Organization : Environmental Research Institute of Michigan , Ann Arbor , Michigan Lines : 78 I have been studying the Bible now for about a year . I love it , but I am not very familiar with the different denominations , or traditions , or common beliefs of various christian groups . I have heard various people ( outside this news group ) describe *idols* such as power , money , material possessions etc . These things are worshiped in some sense I suppose , but I never really gave idols much thought . Until now ... I have been reading the postings in this news group ( which I just found a few days ago ) , and I have a question ... First , I'm not trying to question anyone 's belief or try to push my views on anyone else ( I have n't been at this long enough to have any views other than I can not get to heaven by being good , I must understand that Christ bore my sins on the cross so that I could be saved and I need to repent , i.e . realize that every time I sin , I might as well stick a sharp stick in Christ 's side because He took the punishment for my sins , when He died on the cross ) . In my studies , Mary never really comes up . I know who she is , but that 's about it . It seems to me that a statue of Mary could be considered an idol ? Do people pray to statues of Mary ? It sounds like educated christians ( more educated than myself I 'm sure ) believe Mary was sinless ? Wow ... I hoped to spend the summer convincing myself ( one way or the other ) about Tongues ( I 'm reading `` Charismatic Chaos '' ) . I guess I 'll study Tongues in parallel with reading this news group . Any help you can give me will be appreciated . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - [ I do n't think the issue is so much that people are more educated than you ( though it may well be that they are ) , as that they come from a different tradition than yours . This is a discussion between Catholics and Protestants . Catholics generally believe that Mary was sinless . Protestants do not . The issue comes down to different sources of authority . Protestants generally limit themselves to the Bible as a source of doctrine . Since this is n't in the Bible ( except in passages that no one would understand in this way if they did n't already believe it ) , Protestants do n't accept it . Catholics see continuing revelation through the Church , though they believe the results are consistent with the Bible . I interpret your posting , not as a call for yet another argument about whether the Catholic Marian devotions are idolatry ( an argument I am not prepared to see newed here ) , but as a sign of being interested in learning about traditions other than your own . Catholics are of course a major one , but by no means the only one . I generally consider the major traditions to be Catholic , Orthodox , and various subsets of Protestantism . Within Protestantism , it 's a matter of how finely you want to cut things . These days I think the major division is between those who accept Biblical inerrancy and those who do n't . There are also a number of major historical traditions , but in recent decades distinctions are tending to blur . I 'd identify the major Protestant traditions as : Lutheran , Reformed , Anglican ( they 're sort of halfway between Catholic and Protestant ) , Wesleyan , Baptist , Holiness , Pentecostal , Church of Christ But there are a number of others . Historical distinctions tend not to be so important among the liberal churches anymore , and I think current trends in society and the Church are also tending to make conservatives seen themselves as allies from a general `` evangelical '' perspective . But differences among these various traditions are still quite marked . I think the best introduction to these issues is to read a good book on church history . Anyone who wants to understand the church really needs to understand how we got where we are now . A church history will normally show you where each of these traditions came from , and give a feeling for their nature . Unfortunately I 'm away from my library at the moment , so I do n't have anything specific to recommend . -- clh ]

However I expereince a severe power drop at cruising speeds under load . That is , on a mild upgrade @ 50 mph in 4th or 5th I 'm lucky if I can hold speed . If I try to add throttle much past 5000 rpm , power drops drastically . Put simply , under load , the engine wo n't rev past 5000 rpm . The top third/half of the throttle range is dead . Standing still the engine runs fine up to red line ( 9-10K ) . Other phenomenology : at about the point that power loss kicks in , the engine becomes a little wavery . That is , at a steady throttle the engine speed goes up and down slightly . The bike has about 13000 miles on it and is in good tune , at least until it starts to balk . I would appreciate any suggestions as to what 's ailing the poor beast . My thoughts run toward clogged jets and/or improper spark advance . I'm hoping it 's not something more drastic since the bike 's not really worth the hassle of any major engine work . Thanks , Britt Park britt @ cb-iris.stanford.edu

Physicians seem to have a variety of '' thresholds '' for electing to biopsy someone 's liver . Personally , I think that if the patient is asymptomatic , with only slight transaminitis and normal albumin and PT , one can simply follow them closely and not add the potential risks of a biopsy .

'' used as an arguement against the deutercanonical books . I feel this is ridiculous for two reasons : 1 . They were n't added later by the Catholic Church ; they were *always* part of what was considered inspired scripture . ( This has been dealt with in previous postings ... no reason to repeat the info . ) 2 . It is more likely than not that when St. John ( or whomever ) wrote the book of Revelation WHAT WAS THEN CONSIDERED SCRIPTURE was ** NOT ** the same thing you and I are holding in our hands ! If one takes the translation of `` this book '' in REV 18:22 ( or somewhere around there ) to mean `` all of scripture '' , then all of us are likely holding something that is in violation of this command . It is impossible to exactly date the scriptures , even the N.T . ones ( they did n't like to date their letters , I guess ) . I really wish I had my bible with me right now to get the facts straight , but I believe that several of the N.T . letters , chief among them 2 Peter , have their most likely date of composition in the early second century A.D . Revelation was almost certainly written durin the reign of Domition ( sp ? ) , A.D. 80-96 . Thus it could be argues that we are all in sin if we accept 2 Peter as scripture , since it was `` added '' to the book after the composition of Revelation , when we are told to add nothing more . If you want to get the exact dates , get a copy of the New American Bible . I 'll try to follow this up tomorrow if I remember . - Mike Walker mdw3310 @ uxa.cso.uiuc.edu ( Univ . of Illinois )

Seriously , I do n't mind a baseball game that lasts a long time if it lasts a long time because there is good baseball being played . However , I don't like 3-2 games that take 3+ hours , because there 's a lot of dead time going on in that game . I do n't find anything exciting about watching batter or pitcher wander around between pitches , or watching the catcher make a slow walk to the mound , or watching lots of pitcher changes for no good reason ( Whitey Herzog used to be the master of this ; the game could be way out of reach , and he 'd still be making switches for platoon advantage ) . I want to see the game , not people standing around . I do n't really enjoy watching NFL football games in person , for example , because there 's so much dead time ( you do n't really notice how much dead time there is if you watch it on television , because they 're busy showing you replays ) . I do n't like that college basketball games have so many time outs at the end of the game ( the NCAA has made some moves to try to alleviate this problem for next year : they 're going to stop the clock after made baskets late in games next year , and they 're going to a 35 second clock ) . There 's also a difference in how tolerant I am of long games if I'm watching them on the tube , and if I 'm going there in person . For me , going to an A 's game has become a major commitment of time , one that I 'm not willing to make that often : the length of their games is costing the A's revenue from me .

So far as Jesus saying `` everyone '' : A certain ruler asked Jesus , `` Good teacher , what must I do to inherit eternal life ? '' `` Why do you call me good ? '' Jesus answered . `` No one is good -- except God alone . '' Ken , the book of Romans states that we are born sinners . We do not grow into being a sinner . We sin because we are sinners . The common mistake , even in Christian circles , is to think the reverse true . So for as surely as you grew to look like you parents , you not only inherited their appearance , but also their sin nature . It goes with being human . Even though a new-born is innocent as can be , his sinful nature will surely manifest itself more explicity as he gets older . For as surely as he grows hair on his head and teeth within his mouth , he will show the signs of his innate sin by rebelling against mommy and daddy with that loud proclamation `` No . ''

I quote from the journal , `` 30 Days In the Church and In the World , '' 1992 , No . 8/9 , p. 29 . Regarding the new draft of the Universal Catechism : In procuring the common good of society the need could arise that the aggressor be placed in the position where he can not cause harm . By virtue of this , the right and obligation of public authorities to punish with proportionate penalties , including the death penalty , is acknowledged . For similar reasons , legimate authorities have the right to impede aggressors in society with the use of arms . The Church 's traditional teaching has always been expressed and will continue to be expressed in the consideration of the real conditions of common good and the effective means for preserving public order and personal safety . To the degree that means other than the death penalty and military operations are sufficient to keep the peace , then these non-violent provisions are to be preferred because they are more in proportion and in keeping with the final goal of protection of peace and human dignity . As is clearly shown by this excerpt , the Church 's teaching on capital punishment remains today as it has always been in the past - in total accord with my sentiment that I do not disagree with the use of deadly force in those cases for which this option is justifiable . > I do not think your biblical quote can automatically be taken > as support for capital punishment .

Let 's look at what the Bible has to say about it . I do n't think the issue of whether infants have faith is relevant or not . Certainly they *can* , as the example of John in utero proves . I find the translation of Col 2 above odd in terms of the circumcision of christ , which the KJV and RSV put in terms of Christ 's cricumcision which we , in union with him *participate* in putting off the body of sins of the flesh . Also , perhaps cor 2:12 is dividing the act of burial with him in baptism , which can be independant of faith , from the experience of rising with Christ by faith . Who says both are by faith ? This interpretation has the advantage of explaining those who are faithlessly baptized , for whom their baptisim is not benefit , but serves to put them into the kingdom nonetheless . Like the israelites ( all of them , children included ) who were baptized in the cloud and in the sea , it was of no advantage because they did not add to their baptism faith and obedience . Baptism does not impart faith , nor is it done strictly speaking on the basis of the faith of the parent , but because of the covcenant promise of God . It imparts grace , the grace of the kingdom , which can be a punishement in disguise if there is later apostacy . > > Romans 10:16-17 `` But not all the Israelites accepted the good news .

While this psalm is figurative in it 's language , it is not hyperbolic , and the one does not necessarily imply the other . There is not other hyperbolic language in this psalm . What v 5 is likely refering to is what is symbolized by the OT cleanliness laws ( which make intercourse and childbrith both acts which caus uncleannes and seperation from God ) . The whole psalm is in the language of OT ritual ( hyssop , cleansing , burnt offering , etc ) David 's sin with bathsheba included this element , as he did not ritually cleanse himself when he should have . But what was symbolized by the OT ritual was the truth that sin was passed generationally . That 's why the organ of generation had to be cut . That 's why brith was unclean . Uncleanness was death , and all babies were born dead , and needed to be washed to newness of life , which we have in baptism today . paul duggan

Elizabeth Bartley ) writes : > I can certainly see opposing the `` Amen '' -- but that does n't require > opposing a moment of silence . I already responded to this on one dimension , but afterthoughts cause me to make another , independent reply . The problem with a `` moment of silence '' is that it is NOT an even-handed way of `` allowing '' for religion amongst students in the public schools . As I noted before , Muslims need more than a moment of silence in order to perform the prayers they are required by Muhammad to do . And ( at least Orthodox ) Jewish prayer also has requirements that are not addressed by this . There is , in fact , a highly selective BIAS towards Christian prayer in this `` moment of silence '' shit . And that is especially bizarre in that Christian prayer DOES N'T NEED this stuff -- a Christain may pray totally incognito AT ANY TIME ( to some extent , this is true of Muslims and Jews as well -- what I intend in my first paragraph is that there *are* some characteristic forms of prayer in *these* religions which DO need special times and/or behavior , which can not be undertaken without an observer being able taking note of it . ) A Christian may pray , at ANY time -- silently and without any trace of his activity being evident to others . That may or may not be true of the other religious traditions amongst us : certainly , these tend to have SOME forms of prayer that WOULD evidence differences from American/Protestant '' mainstream '' religion . All that a `` moment of silence '' does is to allow THAT ONE tradition which does n't NEED it , to have a `` special '' place set aside in the public schools . There is NOTHING in Christian prayer that requires public forms , or rugs , or phylacteries , or anything else at all visible to the outside world . A Christian student MAY ( and probably does ) pray at innumerable times during the day , without anyone else knowing it . [ That may also be true of non- Christians -- I am not claimng otherwise ] . In the `` moment of silence '' it would STILL be difficult for the Jews to gather and daven , for the Muslims to do their ablutions and find qiblah to Mecca and engage in the prescribed forms . But *of course* Christians can do *their* thing -- and therefore , the provision is nothing but a disguised attempt to encourage just that . Luckily , there *is* a strong Jewish presence in this country ( and I , as a Christian , revere some of the Jewish teachers I had in public schools ) , and a growing Muslim presence as well . I can only hope that the political forces consequent on this will PREVENT the imposition of Christian forms on non-Christians . As far as I can see ( as a Christian ) there is NOTHING in this `` moment of silence '' campaign but an attempt to use PUBLIC social pressure to FORCE children to adhere to a pattern that is biased towards Christianity . And as a Christian , I *must* protest such coercion . For what it 's worth , I suspect that the coercion is not really targeted at the non-Christians -- it is yet another case of FAILURE amongst Christian parents in `` making '' their children prayerful , so that they want the public schools to teach what THEY can not manage to teach , despite having all the opportunity in the world to do so . If you have taught your children to pray , they do NOT need a moment of silence in school . If you have NOT managed to teach them , the moment will only embarrass you . Give it up . -- Michael L.

From : barring @ cs.washington.edu ( David Barrington ) Subject : Red Sox Choke Contest Organization : Computer Science & Engineering , U. of Washington , Seattle Lines : 21 To encourage the great tradition of Red Sox negativism , I am having a contest to predict the magnitude of the Sox ' fall from their current heights . You must decide first , whether the Sox will be at .500 again at any time during this year . Then you must predict either : ( 1 ) Their record the first time they 're at .500 , if they are , or ( 2 ) Their final record , if they stay above .500 the rest of the year . So Valentine 's earlier prediction would go as `` 13-13 '' ( resend it if you were serious , Val ! ) . ESPN pointed out last night that the last Sox start better than this was in 1952 , when they finished 76-78 , in sixth place . So email me your guess , either at `` barring @ cs.washington.edu '' or directly replying to this post . Entries close 5 pm PDT on Wed 28 Apr 1993 . Dave MB

That 's fine idea , but it only works if the lighting/power company even bothers to supply good light fixtures . For instance , a power company in Virginia recently asked a state commission for permission to sell more lights of various type . Yet , all of the different fixture that they sold and wanted to sell were bad designs - one that wasted the light . Thus , you could n't even buy a good light from them . In most places , to get a good light , you have to either order it special at high cost or call a store in Arizona . At some point , society starts to make rules . Cars have to pass safety tests . Companies have to meet pollution standards , etc.. There are two ways to achieve this : educate the public so that they demand good lighting or force code down the lighting companies backs . History seems to suggest that the latter is more likely to work . > > Please note that I 'm not defending light pollution .

His gripe was not that thay professed *a* > gnosis , but that they had the *wrong* one . I 'm afraid that I can not find this portrayal in _EH_ . I do n't see anywhere in 3:32:7-8 where Eusebius mentions that certain gnostics had the wrong gnosis . The closest is when Eusebius summarizes Hegesippus ' statements , '' ... whilst if there were any at all , that attempted to pervert the sound doctrine of the saving gospel , they were yet skulking in dark retreats ...

'' Just in looking at two of the four references that you gave ( I have the _EH_ handy , Irenaeus and the _Clemetine Recognitions_ I will have to look for ) I see no room for such 'interpretations . ' And any such 'interpretation ' still falls short of an equivalence to the Temple Ceremonies . The links for Jay 's using _EH_ for support are : `` imparting the gift of knowledge '' = `` imparted secret information '' = `` being given secret signs and tokens to gain entrance to heaven .

You frequently find a tick crawling on you after a walk in the woods around here , but you tend to notice it before it bites you ; pulling one out of your skin is something you 're not likely to forget . Can you get the fever without it biting you ? Do they sometimes bite you and then let go so you do n't realize you were bitten ?

Nntp-Posting-Host : klaatu.watson.ibm.com Organization : Visualization Systems , IBM Keywords : computer graphics , ray tracing , volume rendering -- - Scientific Visualization of Chemical Systems -- - Cornell Theory Center Summer School Offered through the Cornell School of Continuing Education and Summer Sessions Course Description Within the past ten years , the simulation and modeling of Lines : 197 molecules has evolved from an esoteric academic subject into a international industry . Computer graphics has played a decisive role in this transformation by allowing chemists to build , visualize and interact with complex geometrical objects . While computer scientists are conversant in the language of their own discipline , they are often unfamiliar with the terminology , simulation techniques and practical needs of research chemists . Similarly , chemists are often unfamiliar with the latest paradigms and technological advances in graphical computing . This interdisciplinary course is intended to bridge the gap between computer science and chemistry and to equip chemistry researchers who wish to be more than just casual users of prepackaged graphics software . Although this is not intended to be a course in computational chemistry or drug design , data sets from chemical research problems will be used in lab and students will be encouraged to bring data sets of their own . Lab exercises and projects will be carried out using data-flow programming ( IBM Visualization Data Explorer software ) and students will have access to Cornell Theory Center computing resources , including video recording equipment . Audience : researchers and students in the chemical and biological sciences interested in integrating state-of-the-art computer graphics into their research ; computer scientists wishing to gain familiarity with a major application of scientific visualization . The class size will be limited to 25 participants on a first-come first-served basis . Level : Graduate/advanced undergraduate , 1 or 2 Credits . May be taken without credit as a workshop . Calculus , linear algebra and introductory chemistry required . Familiarity with Unix , X-windows and C is useful but not required . Date : June 14-25 , 1993 ( 2 Credits ) June 14-18 , 1993 ( 1 or 0 credits ) Time : Mon-Fri 9:00 am to 12:00 pm and 1:00 pm to 4:00 pm Cost : 0 or 1 credit $ 410 2 credits $ 820 Format The course will be held in the Theory Center training facility where computer workstations will be available . Daily lectures will be interspersed with laboratory exercises and ample time will be provided for project enablement and familiarization with the new computing environment . Students enrolled for one credit will be graded on the basis of their laboratory exercises and short final project . Those enrolled for a second credit will receive more advanced lectures , be given more time for project development and meet daily to share experience and discuss problems encountered . Content ( may vary ) Elements of computer graphics polygonal rendering , lighting models , ray tracing , volumetric rendering , stereo graphics , animation , introduction to data-flow programming ( DX ) , interactivity . Representing the atom size , time and energy scales basic classical and quantum mechanics Important categories of molecules small molecules , biopolymers , surfaces and catalysts , miscellaneous current applications Data formats and conversions Advanced molecular graphics techniques Types of simulation and experiment electronic structure , molecular dynamics/mechanics electrostatics , X-ray crystallography , NMR , quantum dynamics and spectroscopy . Instructors The course will be taught by two instructors . Topics related to computer graphics will be handled by Dr. Bruce Land , Project Leader of Visualization , Cornell National Supercomputing Facility . Chemistry-specific aspects of the course will be handled by Dr. Richard E.

I 've done some ASIC and digital design , but not any CPU design . It would seem to me that on a 486 , the FPU is not being used , most of the cache is not being accessed , the off chip buffers/drivers are idle , the multiplier is n't multiplying , the barrel shifters are n't shifting , microcode is n't microcoding , etc . This means transistors aren't switching which means less power dissipated ( in CMOS ) , which means less heat.\ From what I understand , the Pentium shuts down those sections of the CPU which are n't being used in order to cut down on heat/power . -- Dennis Lou || `` But Yossarian , what if everyone thought that way ?

The demonstration to which you refer consists of placing a leaf between the plates , and taking a Kirlian photograph of it . You then cut off part of the leaf , put the top plate back on , and take another Kirlian photograph . You see pretty much the same image in both cases . Turns out the effect isn't nearly so striking if you take the trouble to clean the plates between photographs . Seems that the moisture from the leaf that you left on the place conducts electricity .

From : JEK @ cu.nih.gov Subject : Jacob and Esau Lines : 47 Gerry Palo wrote that there is nothing in Christianity that excludes the theory of a succession of lives . I wrote that the Apostle Paul , in Romans 9 , speaks of God as choosing Jacob over Esau , and adds that this is not as a result of anything that either child had done , since they had not been born yet . Clearly , Paul does not believe that they had had previous lives , nor does he suppose that his readers will believe it . For if they had had previous lives , it would not make sense to say , `` Neither of them has done anything good or bad as yet , since they are not yet born . '' Daniel Cossack writes to ask whether it is fair for God to hate Easau when Esau has done nothing bad ? I reply that in Hebrew it is standard usage to speak of hating when what is meant is simply putting in second place . As an example , consider the saying in Matthew 6:24 + No man can serve two masters ; for either he will hate the one + and love the other , or ... . Now , it is obviously false that a man with two masters must hate one of them . But it is obviously true that he must put one of them in second place . A dog that always comes when either Billy or Bobby calls will have a problem if they stand in different places and call simultaneously . It can not give first priority to both . One must take second place . In our original example , second place means that Jacob , not Esau , is chosen to bear the covenant blessing and obligation , and to be the ancestor of Christ . ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** Eugene Bigelow mentions Matthew 11:14 which says of John the Baptist : + And if ye will receive it , this is ELijah , who was to come . I take this to mean that John was an Elijah-like figure , dressing and living like Elijah , preaching like Elijah , and fulfilling the prediction that Elijah would prepare the way for the Messiah . I do not think that he was Elijah in a literal sense , and , appareently , neither did he ( John 1:21 ) . Yours , James Kiefer

I told him I was a Yankee fan and I 'd take him in a second and who would he want in a trade back . He said a pile of sh*t. I know Boggs had some personal problems while playing for Boston , but come on he 's a future hall of famer who really adds a needed dimension to the Yanks . A solid hitter , a decent fielder and more importantly a teacher , ask Pat Kelly . I think he 's got a few good years left in his bat and may be a key contributor down the stretch as they win the American League East this year . Boston fans have no class ! ! !

From : trajan @ cwis.unomaha.edu ( Stephen McIntyre ) Subject : Theists And Objectivity Organization : University of Nebraska at Omaha Lines : 82 Can a theist be truly objective ? Can he be impartial when questioning the truth of his scriptures , or will he assume the superstition of his parents when questioning ? I 've often found it to be the case that the theist will stick to some kind of superstition when wondering about God and his scriptures . I've seen it in the Christian , the Jew , the Muslim , and the other theists alike . All assume that their mothers and fathers were right in the aspect that a god exists , and with that belief search for their god . Occasionally , the theist may switch religions or aspects of the same religion , but overall the majority keep to the belief that some `` Creator '' was behind the universe 's existence . I've known Muslims who were once Christians and vice versa , I 've known Christians who were once Jewish and vice versa , and I 've even known Christians who become Hindu . Yet , throughout their transition from one faith to another , they 've kept this belief in some form of higher `` being . '' Why ? It usually all has to do with how the child is brought up . From the time he is born , the theist is brought up with the notion of the `` truth '' of some kind of scripture -- the Bible , the Torah , the Qur'an , & etc . He is told of this wondrous God who wrote ( or inspired ) the scripture , of the prophets talked about in the scripture , of the miracles performed , & etc . He is also told that to question this ( as children are apt to do ) is a sin , a crime against God , and to lose belief in the scrip- ture 's truth is to damn one 's soul to Hell . Thus , by the time he is able to read the scripture for himself , the belief in its `` truth '' is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a matter of course . But it does n't stop there . Once the child is able to read for himself , there is an endeavor to inculcate the child the `` right '' readings of scripture , to concentrate more on the pleasant readings , to gloss over the worse ones , and to explain away the unexplainable with `` mystery . '' Circular arguments , `` self-evdent '' facts and `` truths , '' unreasoning belief , and fear of hell is the meat of religion the child must eat of every day . To doubt , of course , means wrath of some sort , and the child must learn to put away his brain when the matter concerns God . All of this has some considerable effect on the child , so that when he becomes an adult , the superstitions he 's been taught are nearly impossible to remove . All of this leads me to ask whether the theist can truly be objective when questioning God , Hell , Heaven , the angels , souls , and all of the rest . Can he , for a moment , put aside this notion that God *does* exist and look at everything from a unbiased point of view ? Obviously , most theists can somewhat , especially when presented with `` mythical gods '' ( Homeric , Roman , Egyptian , & etc. ) . But can they put aside the assumption of God 's existence and question it impartially ?

From what I 've heard , they had some chemical ( I assume it was tetrafluoroethylene ) in a tank and but the valve got gummed up . Cutting it open revealed that it had polymerized . The material was useful for seals , but it had a major problem for , say the linings of vessels : it would n't stick to metal . What the space program did was to find a way to get it to stick . Thus we had no-stick frypans on the market in the late '60s . -- - Dan Tilque -- dant @ techbook.com

There is no significant *ability* toi perform in the clutch , but clutch performance certainly happens every time there is a game-winning hit . The `` clutch pitching '' quoted above is something which happened , not a claim that any particular player should be expected to be a clutch pitcher . > Over the past four seasons Sabo has had 59 hits in 259 abs defined as > clutch situations ( by The Scouting Report ) for an average of .228 . > Over that same period he had another 1539 abs with 452 hits for an > average of .294 . > According to the rest of the SDCN 's , any differential such as this is > completely and totally random and can not be used for any reasonable > inference , such as perhaps Perez should have used a pinch hitter in > that situation . Simple statistics tell me that there is a 2 % chance an average clutch hitter would have this large a split ( the average decrease is 7 points , standard deviation about 30 ) . There will be such hitters in any league , just as there will be hitters who hit poorly on Tuesdays . And there is only a very weak correlation ( .01 in my best study ) between clutch hitting in the last four years and clutch hitting this year , probably because most of the clutch data is determinaed by luck rather than any ability . *Based only on this data* , I do n't see any reason to pinch-hit for Sabo , or any other player who had been a poor clutch hitter in the past . But there are many other factors involved in a decision to pinch-hit . Does the pinch-hitter give you a platoon advantage ? ( Any portion of Sabo 's clutch split that results from his platoon split is certainly a real ability , even if it has nothing to do with clutch hitting . ) Do you have a singles hitter at the plate when you need a home run ? Do you have a curveball pitcher facing a batter who has trouble with curves ? -- David Grabiner , grabiner @ zariski.harvard.edu '' We are sorry , but the number you have dialed is imaginary .

In fact , not all Muslims in B-H are followers of Islam . Therefore , there do ( did ? ) exist in ex-Yugoslavia `` Christian Muslims . '' Tito defined the Muslim nation constitutionally , adding Muslims to Serbs , Croats , and Slovenes , the three founding nations which entered into a voluntary union at the end of WWI . In addition , Tito added two other nations constitutionally : Montenegrins , and Makedonijans . Nations had the right of secession , but republics did not . So , `` Muslim '' is much more a political term than a religious term ( for those who differentiate between religion and politics , that is ) in B-H . It was not a `` Christo-Slavic '' ideology that made a Muslim nation in Yugoslavia , it was the `` Atheist Communist '' ideology of Tito . Before Tito , there was no Muslim nation in Yugoslavia . The war is not a religious war , and it is not an ethnic war . It is a civil war in which the terms of secession are being negotiated with guns instead of pens . The Croat , Muslim , and Serb political leaders *all* chose to fight over the terms of secession instead of compromising and peacefully negotiating multilateral secession agreements . -Nick

The most logical trade in the offseason to me would be between Detroit and NY Rangers . I 'm sure if Beezer would be traded he would enjoy the opportunity to go back to his roots in Detroit . He would be a valuable asset to the Wings and Perhaps the Rangers could get a Zombo in return ? Beezer got a few good years in him and the opportunity to get a fresh start would energize his play .

As far as commercialization , that is > a long ways off . ... > Anybody know anything further ? Is this really news ? Does this > threaten further work on DC- ? ? Boeing has been looking at several TSTO vehicles and has carried out extensive conceptual studies of advanced launch systems for some time . A good reference on this might be : `` Comparison of Propulsion Options for Advanced Earth-To-Orbit ( ETO ) Applications ( IAF-92- 0639 ) . '' by V.A . Weldon and L.E . Fink from Boeing . The paper describes a propane-fueled TSTO launch system claimed to achieve aircraft-like operational efficiencies without the problems associated with liquid hydrogen fuel . Basically , it 's a high-speed airplane launching a Hermes-type spaceplane The design ( the concept is also called `` Beta '' ) as laid out in the paper can launch at least 10,000 pounds into polar orbit , or 20,000 pounds to space station orbit including a crew of eight persons and life support . System design reliability is .9995 . Beta is a 360-foot-long first stage powered by two large ramjets and 12 high- speed civil transport ( HSCT ) turbofans . A 108-foot- long reusable orbiter is trapeze-mounted in the belly of the first- stage aircraft , which also could accommodate a longer and heavy payload on an expendable second stage . To launch the orbital vehicle , the first stage takes off like a normal HSCT and accelerates to Mach 3 . At that point the turbofans , modified to burn catalyzed JP-7 , would shut off and the ramjets , would take over . At Mach 5.5 the orbiter or the ELV would swing out , ignite and proceed to orbit . Both vehicles would land like aircraft at the conclusion of their respective missions . Estimated total weight of the combined configuration at takeoff is about 1.5 M lbs , roughly equivalanet to a fully loaded An-225 . The orbiter stages weighs about 400 , Klbs including 335 Klbs of LOX and subcooled propane to power two 250 Klbs vacuum thrust rocket engines . Propellants would be stored at 91 degrees Kelvin , with the propane in a spherical tank mounted forward of the 15-by- 25-foot cargo bay and the two-seat orbiter crew station . LOX would be stored aft . Weldon and Fink claim the key to this design's success is the structurally efficient airframe and the compact tankage allowed by the high-density supercooled hydrocarbon fuel . The paper compares TSTO design to SSTO design . They conclude while a SSTO has a slightly lower recurring cost , a TSTO is easier , cheaper , and less risky to develop , simpler to build , has greater safety and mission versatility and does n't carry the hard-to-handle and bulky hydrogen fuel . The conlcude `` In conjunction with its major use of airplane type engines and fuel , as well as its inherent self- ferry capability , it is probably the system most likely to provide as close to airline-like operations as possible with a practical configuration , until a single stage airbreather/rocket concept can be shown to be operationally viable . '' > Is this really news ? Does this threaten further work on DC- ? Weldon and others at Boeing have been working on TSTO designs for some time . I expect this , or a similar concept ( perhaps the HTHL SSTO they proposed for the SDIO SSTO first phase ) is being re- examined as a basis for a bid on the first phase of SpaceLifter . Does it threaten DC- ? ? ? . Possibly -- There is a set of on-going studies trying straighten out the government 's future space transportation strategy . MDC and Boeing ( as well as other firms ) are providing data to a joint study team back in DC . There are various factions and options vying for attention -- including shuttle upgrades , shuttle replacement ( what was called the `` 4-2-3 '' architecture ) , SpaceLifter , ELV upgrades , and various advanced vehicles ( ALES , Beta , DC- ? ? , NASP , FSTS , SSTOs of several types , etc . ) NASA/DOD/DOT are trying to put together a coherent strategy for future US gov't space transportation systems , and trying to juggle near-term launch needs ( like for DoD and NASA ) against medium-term needs ( including commercial considerations ) , and against the investment and risk of going to `` leap frog '' new technologies like SDIO/SSTO and NASP and Beta . It 's a heck of a problem . The worst part of the problem isn't that there are n't promising ideas and concepts -- there are dozens of them -- but how they balance cost and risk versus real needs in the near term . They should have a draft report in mid-June , with a final report coming by the end of the fiscal year . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Wales Larrison Space Technology Investor -- - Maximus 2.01wb

My boyfriend , age 34 and otherwise in good health , was diagnosed with reflux esophagitis and a hiatal hernia about 2 years ago . At that time he saw a gastroenterologist and has tried acid controllers ( Mylanta , Tagamet ) , as well as a restricted diet and raising the head of his bed . These treatments were not effective and because the damage was worsening , he opted for a surgical repair 3 months ago . He was told there were two repair techniques that could fix the problem ; a Nissen wrap and a `` Hill Repair '' . He opted for the `` Hill Repair '' . He recovered very well from the surgery itself but the pain he had originally is worse and in addition he now has trouble swallowing ( including saliva ) . The doctor now wants to do an endoscopy and has also informed him that a biopsy might be necessary if he has a pre-cancerous condition which he called `` Barrett 's Syndrome '' . If he ca n't avoid having reflux will he necessarily get cancer ? Basically , if anyone has any information on what he should do now , I 'd appreciate it .

From : banschbach @ vms.ocom.okstate.edu Subject : RE : Robert 's Biological Alchemy Lines : 106 Nntp-Posting-Host : vms.ocom.okstate.edu Organization : OSU College of Osteopathic Medicine Robert , I 'm *so* glad that you posted your Biological Alchemy discussion . I 've been compared to the famous Robert McElwaine by some readers of Sci . Med . I did n't know how to respond since I had not seen one of your posts ( just like I have n't read `` The Yeast Connection '' ) . Let me just start by stating that the authors of the `` Cold Fusion '' papers of recent years are now in scientific exile ( I believe that one has actually left the country ) . Scientific fraud is rare . I 'm still not sure that if a review of the research notes of the `` cold fusion scientists '' actually proved fraud or just very shoddy experimentation . Your sources do not seem to be research articles . They are more like lay texts designed to pique human interest in a subject area ( just like the food combining and life extension texts ) . Robert , I try to keep an open mind . But some things I just ca n't buy ( one is taking SOD orally to prevent oxidative damage in the body ) . Your experiment , if conducted by readers of this news group , would prove that you are right ( more ash after seed sprouting than before ) . Unless you use a muffle furnance and obtain a very high temperature ( above 600 degrees I believe ) , you will get organic residue in the ash . Even the residue in commercial incinerators contains organic residue . I remember doing this kind of experiment in my organic chemistry couurse in College but I could n't find a temperature for mineral ash formation so I 'm really guessing at 600 degrees F , it may actually be much higher . The point is that no one in their home could ever get a high enough temperature to produce *only* a mineral ash . They also could not measure the minerals so they could only weigh the ash and find out that you appear to be correct . Chemical reactions abound in our body , in our atmosphere , in our water and in our soil . Are these fusion reactions ? Yes many of them do involve fusing oxygen , nitrogen and sulfur to both organics and inorganics . Do we really have the transformation of silicone to calcium if carbon is fused with silicon ? Not in my book Robert . Silicon is the most abundant mineral on our planet . I 've seen speculation that man could have evolved to be a silicon based rather than a carbon based life-form . I like reading science fiction , as many people do . But I know enough about biochemistry ( and nutrition ) to be able ( in most cases ) to separate the fiction from the fact . Silicon may be one of the trace elements that turns out to be essential in humans . We have several grams of the stuff in our body . What 's it doing there ? Only the Lord knows right now . But I will tell you what I do know about silicon and why , as you state , it helps bone healing ( and it is not because silicon is transformed into calcium ) . Almost all of the silicon in the human body is found in the connective tissue ( collagen and elastin ) . There have been studies published which show that the very high silicon content in elastin may be an important protective factor against atherosclerosis ( the higher the silicon content in elastin , the more resistant the elastin is to a an age-related loss of elasticity which may play a role in the increase in blood pressure that is often seen as part of the ageing process in humans ) . For bone fracture healing , the first step is a collagen matrix into which calcium and phosphate are pumped by osteoblasts . A high level of silicon in the diet seems to speed up this matrix formation . This first step in the bone healing process seems to be the hardest for some people to get going . Electriacl currents have been used in an attempt to get the matrix forming cells oriented in the right direction so that the matrix can be formed in the gap ( or gaps ) between the ends of the broken bone . A vitamin C deficiency ( by slowing collagen formation as well as causing the prodcution of defective collagen ) does slow down both bone and wound healing . Zinc is also another big player in bone and wound healing . And so is silicon ( in an undetermined role that most likely involes matrix formation and not transformation of silicon to calcium ) . For you to take this bone healing observation and use it as proof that silicon is transformed into calcium is an interesting little trick . But Robert , I have the same problem myself when I read the lay press ( and yes even some scientific papers ) . Is the explanation reasonable ? Without a very good science knowledge base , you and most readers of this news group are flying blind ( you have to take it on faith because you do n't know any better ) . If the explanation seems to make sense to me based on my knowledge base , I 'm inclined to consider it ( this usually means trying to find other sources that come to the same conclusion ) . If the idea ( like a candida bloom ) seems to make sense to me , I tend to pursue it as long as any advice that I 'm going to give is n't going to really mess somebody up . If this makes us kindred souls Robert , then I guess I 'll have to live with that label . For the physicians who have decided to read my response to Robert 's interesting post , I hope that you saw the segment on the pediatric neurosurgeon last night on U.S. TV . I ca n't remember the network or his name ( like many nights , I was on my computer and my wife was watching TV in our Den where I have my computer setup ) . This neurosurgeon takes kids with brain tumors that everyone else has given up on and he uses '' unconventional '' treatments ( his own words ) . He says that he has a 70 % success rate . The one case that I heard him discussing would normally use radiation ( conventional treatment ) . He was going to go in and cut . You guys complain about the cost of the anti-fungals . What do you think the cost difference between radiation treatment and surgery is guys ? I 'm going to ask you guys one more time , why blast a physician who takes the chronic sinus sufferer ( like Jon ) and the chronic GI sufferer ( like Elaine ) and tries to help them using unconventional treatments ? Treatments which do not result in death ( like those that the neurosurgeon uses ? ) . Is it because candida blooms are not life-threatening while brain tumors are ? How about quality of life guys ? May the candida demon never cross your sinus cavity or gut ( if it does , you may feel differently about the issue ) . Marty B .

Insurance people claim car is `` totalled '' because of exceeding repair costs . Person says `` WWHHHAATTTT ! ! ! ! But I drove the car here ! '' and takes it to another place . Other place estimates 2,101.00 in damage . 2,000 less than the dealer . One more hitch ... The car is registered in Florida but the accident occurred in Pennsyvania . QUESTION : Should the insurance recognize and pay for the damages of this , now fixable , car even though they prematurly declared totalled ? Please respond via E-Mail if you think you know anything about this sort of thing . chris @ camp.wpic.pitt.edu Thanks ...

My very aged folks live about 50 miles away and I know it would be a great thing for them to attend the game . I went with them , and my grandfather who got me into baseball as a small child , to the All Star game in DC many years ago . Although I 'm now in the SF Bay Area , I 'd *love* to be able to treat my folks to this game ; it 's absolutely the last chance they 'd ever have to attend this g ame locally .

Memorizing large amounts has never been my strong point academically . Since this is a major portion of medical education -- anatomy , histology , pathology , pharmacology , are for the most part mass memorization -- I am a little concerned . As I am sure most med students are . Can anyone suggest techniques for this type of memorization ? I have had reasonable success with nemonics and memory tricks like thinking up little stories to associate unrelated things . But I have never applied them to large amounts of `` data '' . Has anyone had luck with any particular books , memory systems , or cheap software ? Can you suggest any helpful organizational techniques ? Being an older student who returned to school this year , organization ( another one of my weak points ) has been a major help to my success . Please no griping about how all you have to do is `` learn '' the material conceptually . I have no problem with that , it is one of my strong points . But you ca n't get around the fact that much of medicine is rote memorization . Thanks for your help .

I believe that this is not quite correct . My understanding is that LDS is engaged on a project to `` convert '' the souls of deceased persons of other religions , in order to spare them from damnation and gain them entrance into heaven . To this end , the Church has compiled extensive genaeological records , so that they will know the names of people to convert . A long article in the New Yorker a few years ago described the LDS research methods in some detail ( for example , some researchers pay visits to local native storytellers to learn the names of people long dead ) . This sounds like just the sort of lie that would be made up about any unusual religion , but the New Yorker story convinced me that there is some truth to it ( the New Yorker used to do extensive fact-checking , and the story was quite detailed ) .

The system may not rely upon registering people as owning particular phone units , but it is necessary to know which phone units are likely to be used for some suspected criminal communication before you can obtain their unit keys from escrow . This necessity raises the stakes in favor of a criminal's coercing or colluding use of some other person 's Clipper phone . I will restate my assumptions more explicitly and amplify my argument . The original title perhaps should have been `` Distinction between legal and illegal cipher systems considered harmful '' , but `` Clipper considered harmful '' is not inaccurate , and is more eye-catching in the current context . Assumptions : 1 . Clipper is made available . 2 . Laws are passed to make use of cipher systems other than Clipper illegal ( either on radio systems , or on any common carrier system ) . These laws also include enforcement authority to listen across the relevant radio spectrum ( or other medium ) , characterize signals , validate Clipper wrappers , detect probable use of non-Clipper ciphers , and make such detection a cause for further action . 3 . For escrowed keys to be useful , some specific Clipper chip must be associated with a suspected criminal . This means that at a minimum some association between the common carrier 's unique phone ID ( ESN ) and the Clipper chip serial number N will be stored in a government database . An observed pairing of N and ESN other than the one recorded raises a red flag . 4 . To reduce ordinary fraud , the cellphone system which offers Clipper will also be constructed with an ESN mechanism much more tamper-proof and much less spoofable than today 's cellphones . 5 . Criminals want inscrutable communications . Some criminals are not entirely stupid or ignorant , and will figure out both that Clipper cellphones offer excellent security in normal circumstances , and that they offer no security against law enforcement once a ( presumably legitimate ) wiretap order exists . They will also figure out that the wiretap order must necessarily be against a specific cellphone , because each one has a unique unit key . 6 . Criminals do not want to call attention to themselves . Because they are not stupid or ignorant ( or because they read netnews ) , and because they know that their open use of a non-Clipper cipher is likely to be detected , they will generally avoid using non-Clipper ciphers directly on some monitorable/tappable channel . They know that do so would raise a red flag , putting a given cellphone ( if not a given person ) under immediate suspicion . 7 . It is impractical to reverse engineer Skipjack , discover family key F , and construct a functional clone of a Clipper chip . By # 2 , # 3 , # 4 , and # 7 it will be very difficult to spoof a given Clipper phone without immediate detection . Because it is difficult to obscure one's association to a specific phone by reprogramming or changing chips around , the criminal will be motivated to find an intact phone which is associated with someone else . A non-stupid criminal will conclude that they can have Clipper-secure communications , at least for some limited time T , if they buy , beg , borrow , or steal use of someone 's phone in a way that prevents that person from reporting compromise of the phone for at least time T. The encrypted communications might have been recorded , and thus be retrievable later , but the criminal can delay , and quite likely evade , discovery by destroying or abandoning the phone before T elapses . It would be unusual for an innocent person to volunteer use of their Clipper phone to someone else . The honest subscriber does n't want to pay someone else 's bill , and he does n't want to fall under suspicion . This leaves two sources of Clipper phones for criminal use : coercion and collusion . Coercion first . Theft bears a relatively low risk , but also sometimes a low time until detection ( a few minutes if a phone is stolen from a car parked in front of a store , a couple of weeks if a phone is stolen from someone who is away on vacation ) . Criminal commerce is likely to arise in stolen Clipper phones , with phones coming from risk-inured poor criminals , and cash coming from risk-averse wealthy criminals . Someone who is extraordinarily motivated to gain a day or two of undetected communication ( like a terrorist ) could kill a person or hold them hostage . The limited time ( before detection ) that a coerced phone is useful means that continuing criminal enterprises require a continuing supply of freshly coerced phones . There would also be created a collusive commerce between relatively wealthy criminals , and ignorant or don't-care patsies who need money , and who will submit to being paid in return for subscribing to Clipper phone service for someone else 's use . Criminals will learn that it is more to their advantage to coerce use of a Clipper cellphone than it is to apply a non-Clipper cipher to a normal cellphone . They will call much less attention to themselves ( or at least to their stolen phone ) this way . The fact of a phone 's use being coerced must first be reported before it can be identified as an interesting phone , and have its keys obtained from escrow . Clipper also allows an extraordinary opportunity for the criminal to conceal use of super-encryption . An automated full-system surveillance mechanism ( quite feasible across radio bandwidth ) which knows family key F , can validate Clipper wrappers and N : ESN associations , but it can not reveal in realtime the use of super-encryption , unless it knows all unit keys , which we are being assured are only to be made available in two separate pieces , upon specific wiretap-like order . Whereas a criminal 's use of any cipher within a normally cleartext medium would stand out , a criminal 's use of a non-Clipper cipher within a Clipper medium would be very difficult to detect , even ex post facto in bulk recordings , as long as the association between criminal and specific Clipper chip is fractured . If you make use of this other cipher illegal per se , then you can charge the criminal with this ( if you can identify the true criminal - he 'll be using someone else 's phone ) , but you 'll have no evidence to help you against whatever traditional crime he might have been planning . You will not even be able to detect that unusual ( encrypted ) communications are occurring until you identify specific phones and obtain their keys from escrow . The gangster and terrorist are thus arguably more , not less , secure than they were before Clipper came along . I therefore consider Clipper harmful because : 1 . It does not provide absolute privacy to the honest public against aggressive or dishonest government . 2 . If other ciphers are proscribed , it engenders new types of direct criminal threat to the honest public . 3 . It provides an extraordinarily effective mechanism for criminals to hide their use of some other cipher , making it more difficult than ever even to gain notice that unusual communications are occurring and that plans for some criminal act might be in progress . 4 . If other ciphers are proscribed , lazy investigators and prosecutors are more likely to pursue the easily quantifiable cipher-use crime than they are the traditional and directly harmful crimes which key escrow is claimed to help against . 5 . If other ciphers are proscribed , the stage is set for witch hunting of `` illegal '' cipher use . Because any computer can be used as a cipher machine ...

From : benha @ castle.ed.ac.uk ( Ben Hambidge ) Subject : Committing my life to God ? Organization : Edinburgh University Lines : 42 Hi everyone , I 'm trying to find my way to God , but find it difficult as I ca n't hear God talking to me , letting me know that he exists and is with me and that he knows me , and I feel that I ca n't possibly get to know him until he does . Maybe he _is_ talking to me but I just do n't know or understand how to listen . Some Christians tell me that ( in their opinion ) the only way to find God is to take a plunge and commit your life to him , and you will discover . This idea of diving into the totally unknown is a little bit frightening , but I have a few questions . 1 ) How do you actually commit yourself ? If I just say , `` OK God , her you go , I 'm committing my life to you '' , I would n't really feel that he'd listened - at least , I could n't be sure that he had . So how does one ( or how did you ) commit oneself to God ? 2 ) In committing myself in this way , what do I have to forfeit of my current life ? What can I no longer do ? I feel that I 'm as 'good ' as many Christians , and I try to uphold the idea of 'loving your neighbour ' - I do n't go round killing people , stealing , etc. , and I try not to get jealous of other people in any way - and I would say that I keep to the standards of treating other people as well as many Christians . So what do I have to give up ? 3 ) When committed , what do I have to do ? What does it involve ? What ( if any ) burdens am I taking on ? 4 ) So then , what 's the general difference before and after ? I assume , that ( like on your birthday you do n't suddenly feel a year older ) it wo n't suddenly change my life the day I commit myself . So what happens ? 5 ) How can I be sure that it is the right thing to do ? How can I find out what the 'it ' in the last sentence actually _is_ ? !

The viewpoint I follow -- that there is in general no > punishment for apostasy -- is _very_ strongly supported by Qur'an and > hadith . This is very well shown in the book `` Punishment in Islamic Law '' > by Mohamed S. El-Awa ( American Trust Publications , 1981 ) . > I reiterate that I would agree with you that there is little justification for the punishment of apostasy in the Qur'an . In Islamic history , as well , apostasy has rarely been punished . Belief is considered a matter of conscience and since there is to be no compulsion in the matter of belief , apostates have been generally left to believe or not believe as they will . However , when an apostate makes attacks upon `` God and His Messenger '' the situation changes . Now the charge of apostasy may be complicated with other charges - perhaps charges of sedition , treason , spying , etc . If the person makes a public issue of their apostasy or mounts public attacks ( as opposed to arguement ) against Islam , the situation is likewise complicated . If the person spreads slander or broadcasts falsehoods , again the situation changes . The punishments vary according to the situation the apostate is in . Anyhow , the charge of aggravated apostasy would only be a subsidiary charge in Rushdie 's case . There is a distinction in the Qur'an between a formal war situation and being in the situation where someone unilaterally wages war ( by their actions ) , creates disorder , makes mischief , etc . against the Muslims and creates a situation that results in harm to Muslims . Here , a small group or even a single individual could be said to be engaged in such a practise . In other words , there is a clear difference between a formal war situation ( where two clearly defined parties wage war , conclude treaties , exchange prisoners , etc . ) , and dealing with attacks that come from isolated individuals or groups against Islam . It is the second situation , the unilateral attack and the spreading of `` fasad '' that would apply in the case of Rushdie . The matter of Rushdie is not a simple matter of banning an offensive book ( banning the book is secondary ) - a full set of circumstances following the publication of the book come into play as well , including the deaths of many Muslims , and Rushdie 's ( and his publishers ) Media games . > Now , I do not believe in _blindly_ following anyone , no matter > how knowledgeable he or she may be in Islamic law .

I think any sensible human being can see this , so I personally > think that the reasoning of some of our ulema in this matter is faulty , > for they think it is legitimate to use acts of war in times of peace > regarding this particular subject . I am not sure which hadith you are referring to above . I believe that one of the Qur'anic verses on which the fatwa is based is 5:33 . Every verse in the Qur'an has a corresponding `` circumstance of revelation '' but in no way is the understanding ( the tafsir ) of the verse restricted solely to the particular historical circumstance in which it was revealed . If this was the case then we could say that all the laws and regulations that were revealed when the Muslims were NOT involved in conflict , should be suspended when they were at war . The logic does not follow . In complex , real-life situations , there may be many verses and many hadiths which can all be related to a single , complicated situation . The internal relationships between these verses may be quite complex , such that arriving at an understanding of how the verses interlock and how each applies to the particular situation can be quite a demanding task . It is not necessarily a simple `` this or that '' process . There may be many parameters involved , there may be a larger context in which a particular situation should be viewed . All these matters impinge on the situation . In other words there is a great deal involved in deciphering the Qur'an . The Qur'an asks us to reflect on its verses , but this reflection must entail more than simply reading a verse and its corresponding hadith . If the reflection is for the sake of increasing personal piety , then each person has his own level of understanding and there is no harm in that . However , if the reflection is in order to decide matters that pertain to the State , to the gestation of laws and rulings , to the gestation of society , the dispensing of justice , the guidance of the community , then there are certain minimum requirements of understanding that one should achieve . Jaffar Ibn Muhammad as-Sadiq ( a.s. ) relates some of these requirements , as taught by the Prophet ( S.A. ) , in a hadith : '' ... he who does not distinguish in the Book of Allah the abrogating verse from the abrogated one , and a specific one from a general one , and a decisive from an ambiguous ; and does not differentiate between a permission and an obligation , and does not recognize a verse of Meccan period from a Medinite one , and does not know the circumstances of revelation , and does not understand the technical words of the Qur'an ( whether simple or compound ) ; and does not comprehend the knowledge of decree and measure , and is ignorant of advancing and delaying ( in its verses ) ; and does not distinguish the clear from the deep , nor the manifest from the esoteric , nor the beginning from the termination ; and is unaware of the question and the answer , the disjoining and the joining , and the exceptions and the all-inclusive , and is ignorant of an adjective of a preceding noun that explains the subsequent one ; and is unaware of the emphasized subject and the detailed one , the obligatory laws and the permissions , the places of the duties and rules , and the meaning of the lawful and the unlawful ; and does not know the joined words , and the words that are related to those coming before them , or after them - then such a man does not know the Qur'an ; nor is he among the people of the Qur'an ... . '' . Based on these and other hadiths , and in accordance with many Qur'anic verses ( `` Why should not a company from every group remain behind to gain profound understanding ( tafaqquh ) in religion and to warn people when they return to them , so that they may beware . '' ( 9:122 ) ) , a science of jurisprudence arose . The requirements for a person to be considered a mujtahid ( one who can pronounce on matters of law and religion ) are many . I 've listed a few major divisions below - there are , of course , many subdivisions within these headings . - Knowledge of Arabic ( syntax , conjugation , roots , semantics , oratory ) . - Knowledge of tafsir and principles of tafsir . - Logic ( mantiq ) - A knowledge of Hadiths - A knowledge of transmitters ( rijal ) - Knowledge of the principles of juriprudence ( Qur'an , Sunnah , Consensus , Reasoning ) The study of Qur'an and sunnah for purposes of law involves : - discussion of imperatives ( awamir ) - discussion of negative imperatives ( nawahi ) - discussion of generalities and particularities ( aam wa khas ) - discussion of unconditional and conditional - discussion of tacit meanings - discussion of the abstract and the clear - discussion of the abrogator and the abrogated The principles of Application of the law involves : - principles of exemption - principles of precaution - principles of option - principles of mastery The jurisprudent is bound to go through a very rigorous process in pronouncing judgement on a given situation . It is not a matter of looking at one verse and one hadith . Now no one should blindly follow anyone , but there is a difference between blind following and acceding to the opinion of someone who is clearly more knowledgeable and more qualified than oneself . There is the famous hadith of the Prophet ( S.A. ) in which he says : '' The fuqaha ( religious scholars ) are the trustees of the Prophet , as long as they do not concern themselves with the illicit desires , pleasures , and wealth of this world . '' The Prophet ( S.A. ) was asked : `` O Messenger of God ! How may we know if they so concern themselves ? '' He ( S.A. ) replied : '' By seeing whether they follow the ruling power . If they do that , fear for your religion and shun them . '' I do not yet know enough about the Imams of the four Sunni madhabs to comment on how this hadith applies to them or to the contemporary scholars who base themselves upon them . The Prophet also refered to the fuqaha as `` The fortress of Islam '' . My only point is to make it clear that arriving at a legal judgement calls into play a certain amount of expertise - the specifics of this expertise is delineated in the Qur'an and hadith . Those who acquire this expertise are praised in both the Qur'an and hadith - those who without the requisite knowledge pronounce on matters that affect society , state , and religion are cautioned . The only reason I said anything at all about the Rushdie affair in this group , is because the whole basis for the discussion of the fatwa ( that is , apostasy ) , was wrong . When one discusses something they should at least base their discussion on fact . Secondly , Khomeini was condemned as a heretic because he supposedly claimed to be infallible - another instance of creating a straw man and then beating him . > Perhaps we should take our discussion to soc.religion.islam .

From : pv9955 @ albnyvms.bitnet Subject : VW Jetta GLI help Reply-To : pv9955 @ albnyvms.bitnet Organization : University of Albany , SUNY Lines : 17 I am considering the purchse of a 1987 VW Jetta GLI with 87k miles on it . I recently found out that there are two versions of the GLI -- 8v and 16v . I know of three differences between the two cars that both carry the same name : the 16v version has 20 more horsepower , 4 wheel discs , and a standard sunroof . Oops , that 's the difference between the GLI 16v and the regular GL ! ! So in addition to the engine , what other differences exist between the two models of the Jetta GLI ? More importantly , how can I tell which version this one is ? There are no badges that said `` 16v '' so I am inclined to think that is the 8v version . Assuming this one ( the one I looked at ) is the 8v version , is there a valid reason to buy it instead of a comparably equipped GL which would cost less ? ( Of course I would love to get the 16v version , but money talks . ) Please EMail any responses . Thank you . Peter Volpe PV9955 @ albnyvms.bitnet

I 'm thinking to treat the raw data.. not > compressed . Actually , for digital HDTV systems that 's far higher bandwidth than you need , unless there 's some reason you must work in fully-uncompressed HDTV . Also , my calculations is that each frame should be well under 6MB , even using 24 bits/pixel ( which is more bits than you actually need - 15 or 18 should be enough for a moving picture ) . 1600x1100x16bits is 3.5MB ( I'm guessing at HDTV resolution - it may be a bit wider than 1600 , I 'm fairly sure of the 1100 number for most of the digital proposals ) . I hope you have a very fast memory system as well - 180MB/s while displaying will require a heavily interleaved VRAM system . Unless you have a _very_ compelling reason , I 'd advise trying to use at least somewhat compressed data .

The x-Soviet > MY GOSH ! ! ! Sedar , WHAT ARMENIAN GOVERNMENT ? ? ? Armenia did n't even become No wonder you clown are in such a mess . Let 's take Sarkis Atamian 's ( an Armenian Dashnak sociolog ) book , `` The Armenian Community '' , pages 97 and 105 . Atamian quotes : `` ... the immediate question concerned itself with the organization and tactics of revolution . The liberation of Armenia , the immediate aim of the Party , was to be attained by : 1 . Oral and written propaganda . 2 . Terrorism - both as punishment against the enemy and as a measure of self defense . 3 . The creation of an avant-garde of revolutionary groups to be equipped and prepared for action when other nations were prepared for a general uprising . 4 . The organization of larger committees to be in constant contact with each other and subject to a central body . 5 . Organization of units of guerilla fighters . '' Now , on page 105 , Atamian 's book quotes of Armenian constitution : `` ... If the means was revolution , how was the revolution to be attained ? By : 1 . Propaganda 2 . Preparation of combat units and their indoctrination 3 . Encouragement of the revolutionary morale of the people 4 . The arming of the people 5 . Organization of revolutionary committees 6 . Espionage throughout the country and the exchange of information with the official bodies and journals 7 . Organization of financial zones for public collection 8 . 'Fighting and using ' the weapon of the terror on corrupt government officers , spies , traitors , grafters , and all sorts of oppressors 9 . Defense of the people against attacks from the brigandry 10 . Building of roads for the transport of arms 11 . Wrecking and looting of governmental institutions . '' Many of the recent Armenian terrorist acts against the Turkish people were committed by the brainwashed members of the `` Tzeghagron '' , namely , '' race-worshipers '' of the Dashnag Youth Organization . Ironically , again , Tzeghagron was set up by an undisputed Armenian Nazi , Karekin Nejdeh , in 1941 ( see Atamian , loc cit , page 389 ) . Serdar Argic 'We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the Turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination .

Coming from a self-exposed historical revisionist , a self-admitted anti-Muslim and a genocide apologist , Hamaza should take your drivel as a compliment . Furthermore , you even deny the obvious . There was a genocide of the Muslims carried out by order of the fascist x-Soviet Armenian Government . Massacres of Muslims must be studied in detail , because they are the first modern example of the horrible crime of genocide . Blame must be apportioned to the Armenians and their supporters for the murder of Muslims . The Turkish historic homeland , emptied of its native population until today , remains occupied by the x-Soviet Armenian Government . Today , x-Soviet Armenia covers up the genocide perpetrated by its predecessors and is therefore an accessory to this crime against humanity . x-Soviet Armenia must pay for its crime of genocide against the Muslims by admitting to the crime and making reparations to the Turks and Kurds . The following are the Jewish and Armenian sources on the cold-blooded genocide perpetrated by the x-Soviet Armenian Government against 2.5 million Muslim people between 1914 and 1920 . Still denying the obvious ? Source : Stanford J.

Leaving Erivan on April 28 , 1915 , Armenian volunteers reached Van on May 14 and organized and carried out a general slaughter of the local Muslim population during the next two days . '' `` Knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions , Armenians looked to Russia and Europe for the fulfillment of their aims . Armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the First World War with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse to serve their state , the Ottoman Empire , and to assist instead other invading Russian armies . Their hope was their participation in the Russian success would be rewarded with an independent Armenian state carved out of Ottoman territories . Armenian political leaders , army officers , and common soldiers began deserting in droves . '' `` With the Russian invasion of eastern Anatolia in 1914 at the beginning of World War I , the degree of Armenian collaboration with the Ottoman 's enemy increased drastically . Ottoman supply lines were cut by guerilla attacks , Armenian revolutionaries armed Armenian civil populations , who in turn massacred the Muslim population of the province of Van in anticipation of expected arrival of the invading Russian armies .

Let the Russian flag wave freely over the Dardanelles and the Bosporus . Let , with Your will , great Majesty , the peoples remaining under the Turkish yoke receive freedom .

The estimated population of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000 , of whom 940,000 ( 20 percent ) were Armenian , 1,200,000 ( 25 percent ) Georgian , and 2,220,000 ( 45 percent ) Moslem . Of the latter group , 1,140,000 were Tatars . Paradoxically , barely one-third of Transcaucasia 's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia , where the Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds . Erevan uezd , the administrative center of the province , had only 44,000 Armenians as compared to 68,000 Moslems . By the time of the Russian Census of 1897 , however , the Armenians had established a scant majority , 53 percent , in the guberniia ; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent , or 670,000 of the 1,120,000 inhabitants . This impressive change in the province 's ethnic character notwithstanding , there was , on the eve of the creation of the Armenian Republic , a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the southern districts , from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia .

Our troops surrounded village after village . Little resistance was offered . Our artillery knocked the huts into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable and inhabitants fled from them into fields , bullets and bayonets completed the work . Some of the Tartars escaped of course . They found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border into Turkey . The rest were killed . And so it is that the whole length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of Tartar villages . They are quiet now , those villages , except for howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the scattered bones of the dead .

He must , and I mean MUST , get fastballs to hit ... otherwise he becomes little more than Sixto Lezcano in disguise . What I would suggest is perhaps batting Bonds , Williams , and Clark 3-4-5 , the reason being that I feel Bonds ' potential basestealing abilities are wasted when he 's stuck behind two slow runners .

Organization : University of St.Gallen , Switzerland Lines : 21 I have a 486/50Mhz ISA Board with 256kbyte Cache and 16 Megs RAM . I just bought the new soundblaster 16 and tried to install the card . The sb16 uses 16bit DMA channel.I could select between channel 5 to 7 . It is the first card I ever installed that uses 16bit dma transfer . After I tested the card the first time , the computer crashed and I got a parity error-system halted . This happens either from dos as also from windows . So it seems that my 16 bit dma channels are not working properly ( they are there because testsb16.exe recocnize them and tests them ok until first access ) . Well , does anybody know a solution for this problem or a special test program for dma problems ? I eliminated the problem temporaly by using only 8 bit dma channel but it makes the system slow !

Case Western Reserve Med School teaches nutrition in its own section as well as covering it in other sections as they apply ( i.e .

Well , maybe I 'm getting picky , but I always thought that a yeast was one form that a fungus could exist in , the other being the mold form . Many fungi can occur as either yeasts or molds , depending on environment . Candida exibits what is known as reverse dimorphism - it exists as a mold in the tissues but exists as a yeast in the environment . Should we maybe call it a mold infection ? a fungus infection ?

I have n't actually used one or seen one , so take the specs with a grain of salt . I 'd like to see an independent review of one against , say , an SGI Indigo Extreme or something . Basically , the Kenai workstations are DEC Alpha AXP based workstations that run OSF/1 ( DEC 's ) and will likely run Windows NT in the future . They are binary compatible with Digital 's OSF/1 Alpha AXP implementation . Denali is their graphics subsystem , which is upgradable in the field by simply adding `` transformation engines '' . The two main Kenai machines are the 3400 Imaging and 3D Graphics Workstation and the 3500 Imaging and 3D Graphics Workstation . 3400 3500 CPU DEC Alpha AXP 133MHz DEC Alpha AXP 150MHz On-chip cache 8k/8k 8k/8k Onboard cache 512K 512K Word Size 64-bit 64-bit Memory ( initial ) 32-128MB 32-256MB Memory ( future ) 512MB 1GB SPECMARK89 111 126 SPECINT92 75 84 SPECFP92 112 128 GRAPHICS Transform Modules 1-6 1-6 Frame Buffer Modules 5,10,20 5,10,20 Frame Buffer 1280x1024x24bit 1280x1024x24bit double buffered double buffered Z-buffer 24-bit 24-bit Alpha/stencil 8-bit 8-bit Stereo support yes yes Other : both machines will double buffer or do stereo output per window .

The Kenai stations work with a graphics architecture known as Denali . The Denali comes in three models , the E , P , and V. They use a DECchip 21064 superscalar RISC processor at 150MHz .

Also called sarcasm . The usual procedure is to accept some part of the 'oppositions ' arguement and run with it until one goes beyond 'rational thought ' and then ring the changes . z.B . The idea of a minimum wage is considered a good one . And in these times of economic difficulty , the Washington legislature is propossing to raise the State MinWage from $ 4.25 ( the federal level ) to $ 4.90 ( fifteen cents over Oregon 's ) . It would seem to me that this increase does not keep pace with inflation , that the minimum wage should be to $ 6.08 by my figures , so it is proposed that we raise the minimum wage to $ 6.50 per hour by 1 July and then give a 10 % cost of living increase every 4 July . and anyone who does n't like it is obviously a country club republican getting rich off the exploitation of poor people . chus pyotr -- pyotr @ halcyon.com Sometimes Pyotr Filipivich , sometimes Owl .

From : scott @ prism.gatech.edu ( Scott Holt ) Subject : hate the sin ... Organization : Georgia Institute of Technology Lines : 33 '' Hate the sin but love the sinner '' ... I 've heard that quite a bit recently , often in the context of discussions about Christianity and homosexuality ... but the context really is n't that important . My question is whether that statement is consistent with Christianity . I would think not . Hate begets more hate , never love . Consider some sin . I 'll leave it unnamed since I do n't want this to digress into an argument as to whether or not something is a sin . Now lets apply our `` hate the sin ... '' philosophy and see what happens . If we truly hate the sin , then the more we see it , the stronger our hatred of it will become . Eventually this hate becomes so strong that we become disgusted with the sinner and eventually come to hate the sinner . In addition , our hatred of the sin often causes us to say and do things which are taken personally by the sinner ( who often does not even believe what they are doing is a sin ) . After enough of this , the sinner begins to hate us ( they certainly do n't love us for our constant criticism of their behavior ) . Hate builds up and drives people away from God ... this certainly can not be a good way to build love . In the summary of the law , Christ commands us to love God and to love our neighbors . He does n't say anything about hate . In fact , if anything , he commands us to save our criticisms for ourselves . So , how are Christians supposed to deal with the sin of others ? I suppose that there is only one way to deal with sin ( either in others or ourselves ) ... through prayer . We need to ask God to help us with our own sin , and to help those we love with theirs . Only love can conquer sin ... hatred has no place . The best way to love someone is to pray for them . - Scott -- This is my signature . There are many like it , but this one is mine .

But if you can contrive > to control the action in dreams or do an OOBE , it seems like a morality applies . I think that if someone often has immoral dreams , like lustful dreams , or dreams where you commit acts of violence , etc . etc . it may be a sign that he has something sinful in his heart . It may be the Holy Spirit's way of allowing the sinfulness that is in us to come to light so that we can pray about it and have it removed . Generally , if one has a pure heart , and sets his mind on things that are holy , he will be holy even when he dreams . Dreams also can be from the Lord . Joseph and Nebucadnezzar are two examples of people in the Bible who received dreams from the Lord . Regarding out of body experiences , this is something that we have to be careful with . What is called an OOBE can be spiritual in nature , especially if what one saw is the same as an experience witnessed by someone else . Christians should certainly avoid any occult activity that would generate an out of body experience . Some things that might be called an OOBE might actually be from the Lord . Paul wrote of what might of been an OOBE . In II Corinthians 12 , he wrote of a spiritual experience of being caught up into the third heaven . Is an OOBE truely an OOBE ? Does one really leave his body , or is he just seeing an image being shown to him by a spirit , be it a demon or the Holy Spirit ? I do n't think it matters that much . Paul could not tell . Be that as it may , we should be careful not to open ourselves up to Satan to experience OOBE 's . We should not meditate and pretend we are in a place until our spirits apparently float there . This is dangerous . If God wants to gice us what seems like an OOBE , then He can do that of His own sovereign will . In the Bible , most often it seems that prophets are just taken up by God 's sovereign will , and not because they are seeking an OOBE . John was in the Spirit praying on the Lord 's day when he was caught up in the visions he received . Ezekial was talking with some Jewish leaders when he was caught up into the visions of God one time . If God wants to take one of us up into a vision , he can do it . People should be careful not to open themselves up to evil spirits for the sake of a few thrills . Link Hudson .

From : REXLEX @ fnal.gov Subject : ARSENOKOITAI : Scroggs ( # 3 ) Organization : FNAL/AD/Net Lines : 199 [ cont . Dr. James DeYoung ; # 3 ] R. Scroggs Robin Scroggs has built upon the discussion of his predecessors and suggested a new twist to the word . Scroggs believes that arsenokoitai is a '' Hellenistic Jewish coinage , perhaps influenced by awareness of rabbinic terminology . '' The term is derived from Lev 18 '' 22 & 20:13 where the LXX juxtaposes the two words arsenos ( `` male '' ) and koiten ( `` bed '' ) , and represents the Hebrew miskab zabar ( `` lying with a male '' ) . Yet he believes that Paul did not originate the term , but borrowed it from `` circles of Hellenistic Jews acquainted with rabbinic discussions '' ( 180 n.14 ) . It was invented to avoid '' contact with the usual Greek terminology '' ( 108 ) . If this is true , Scroggs observes , it explains why the word does not appear in Greco-Roman discussions of pederasty and why later patristic writers avoided it . It was meaningless to native-speaking Greeks ( 108 ) . Scroggs takes the second part as the active word and the first word as the object of the second part , thus differing from Boswell 's `` learned discussion '' ( 107 ) . Yet Scroggs understands the general meaning of `` one who lies with a male '' to have a very narrow reference . With the preceding malokoi ( I Cor 6:9 ) , which Scroggs interprets as `` the effeminate call-boy , '' arsenokoitai is the active partner `` who keeps the malakos of the 'mistress ' or who hires him on occasion to satisfy his sexual desires '' ( 108 ) . Hence arsenokoitai does not refer to homosexuality in general , to female homosexuality , or to the generic model of pederasty . It certainly can not refer to the modern gay model , he affirms ( 109 ) . This is Scrogg 's interpretation of the term in I Tim 1:10 also . The combination of pornoi ( `` fornicators '' ) , arsenokoitai and andrapodistai ( `` slave dealers '' ) refers to `` male prostitutes , males who lie [ with them ] , and slave dealers [ who procure them ] '' ( 120 ) . It again refers to that specific form of pederasty `` which consisted of the enslaving of boys as youths for sexual purposes , and the use of these boys by adult males '' ( 121 ) . Even `` serious minded pagan authors '' condemned this form of pederasty . He then uses these instances of arsenokoitai in I Cor and I Tim to interpret the apparently general condemnation of both female and male homosexuality in Rom 1 . Consequently Paul `` Must have had , could only have had pederasty in mind '' ( 122 ) . We can not know what Paul would have said about the `` contemporary model of adult/adult mutuality in same sex relation ships '' ( 122 ) . In relating these terms to the context and to contemporary ethical concerns , Scroggs emphasizes the point that the specific items in the list of vices in I Cor 6 have no deliberate , intended meaning in Paul . The form and function of the catalogue of vices are traditional and stereotyped . Any relationship between an individual item in the list and the context was usually nonexistent . He concludes that Paul `` does not care about any specific item in the lists '' ( 104 ) . Both on the basis of the meaning of the terms and of the literary phenomenon of a `` catalogue of vices , '' Scroggs argues that the Scriptures are '' irrelevant and provide no help in the heated debate today '' ( 129 ) . The `` model in today 's Christian homosexual community is so different from the model attacked by the NT '' that `` Biblical judgments against homosexuality are not relevant to today 's debate . They should no longer be used in denominational discussions about homosexuality , should in no way be a weapon to justify refusal of ordination . . . `` ( 127 ) . REACTIONS TO THE NEW INTERPRETATIONS OF ARSENOKOITAI D. Wright In more recent years the positions of Bailey , Boswell , and Scroggs have come under closer scrutiny . Perhaps the most critical evaluation of Boswell's view is that by David Wright . In his thorough article , Wright points out several shortcomings of Boswell 's treatment of arsenokoitai . He faults Boswell for failing to cite , or citing inaccurately , all the references to Lev 18:22 and 20:13 in the church fathers , such as Eusebius , the `` Apostolic Constitutions , '' Clement of Alexandria , Tertullian and Origen ( 127-28 ) . Boswell has not considered seriously enough the possibility that the term derives either its form or its meaning from the Leviticus passages ( 129 ) . This is significant , for if the term is so derived , it clearly refutes Boswell's claim that the first half of the word ( arseno- ) denotes not the object but the gender of the second half ( -koitai ) . The LXX must mean `` a male who sleeps with a male , '' making arseno- the object . Wright also faults Boswell 's claims regarding linguistic features of the term , including suggested parallels ( 129 ) . Though Boswell claims that compounds with arseno- employ it objectively and those with arreno- employ it as an adjective , Wright believes that the difference between the two is merely one of dialectical diversity : `` No semantic import attaches to the difference between the two forms '' ( 131 ) . Wright believes that in most compounds in which the second half is a verb or has a verbal force , the first half denotes its object and where `` the second part is substantival , the first half denotes its gender '' ( 132 ) . It is with Boswell 's treatment of the early church fathers that Wright takes special issue , because the former has failed to cite all the sources . For example , Aristides ' Apology ( c. AD 138 ) probably uses arrenomaneis , androbaten , and arsenokoitias all with the same basic meaning of male homosexuality ( 133 ) , contrary to Boswell 's discussion . Boswell fails to cite Hippolytus ( Refut . Omn . Haer . 5:26:22-23 ) and improperly cites Eusebius and the Syriac writer Bardensanes . The latter uses Syriac terms that are identical to the Syriac of I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10 ( 133-34 ) . Next Wright shows how the early church fathers use arsenokoitai in parallel with paidophthoria referring to male homosexuality with teenagers , the dominant form of male homosexuality among the Greeks ( 134 ) . Sometimes this parallelism occurs in the threefold listings of moicheia ( `` adultery '' ) , porneia ( `` fornication '' ) , and paidophthoria , with arsenokoitai replacing paidophthoris ( 136 ) . Clement of Alexandria in Protr . 10:108:5 cites the second table of the Ten Commandments as `` You shall not kill , ou moicheuseis ( `` you shall not commit adultery '' ) , ou paidophthoreseis ( `` you shall not practice homosexuality with boys '' ) , you shall not steal . . . '' ( 150 n. 43 ) . Another occurrence of arsenokoitein ( `` commit homosexuality '' ) exists in the Sibylline Oracles 2:71-73 . It may be , Wright observes , that the word was coined by a Jewish pre-Christian writer in a Hellenistic setting represented by Or.Sib. , book 2 ( 137-38 ) . Wright also discusses uses of arsenokoitai in Rhetorius ( 6th c. ) who drew upon the first century AD writer Teucer , in Macarius ( 4th-5th c. ) , and in John the Faster ( d. 595 ) ( 139-40 ) . The last in particular bears the idea of homosexual intercourse , contrary to Boswell . Wright next replies to Boswell 's contention that the term would not be absent `` from so much literature about homosexuality if that is what it denoted ( 140-41 ) . Wright points out that it should not be expected in writers prior to the first century AD since it did not exist before then , that the Greeks used dozens of words and phrases to refer to homosexuality , that some sources ( e.g . Didache ) show no acquaintance with Paul 's letters or deliberately avoid citing Scripture , and that Boswell neglects citing several church fathers ( 140-41 ) . Boswell 's treatment of Chrysostom in particular draws Wright 's attention ( 141-44 ) . Boswell conspicuously misrepresents the witness of Chrysostom , omitting references and asserting what is patently untrue . Chrysostom gives a long uncompromising and clear indictment of homosexuality in his homily on Rom 1:26 . Boswell has exaggerated Chrysostom 's infrequent use of the term . Wright observes that Boswell has `` signally failed to demonstrate any us of arsenokoites etc . in which it patently does not denote male homosexual activity '' ( 144 ) . It is infrequent because of its relatively technical nature and the availability of such a term as paidophthoria that more clearly specified the prevailing form of male homosexuality in the Greco-Roman world . Wright also surveys the Latin , Syriac , and Coptic translations of I Tim and I Cor . All three render arsenokoitai with words that reflect the meaning '' homosexual '' i.e. , they understand arseno- as the object of the second half of the word ( 144-45 ) . None of these primary versions supports Boswell 's limited conclusion based on them . Wright concludes his discussion with a few observations about the catalogues of vices as a literary form . He believes that such lists developed in late Judaism as Hellenistic Jews wrote in clear condemnation of homosexuality in the Greek world . This paralleled the increased concern on the part of moral philosophers over homosexual indulgence . The term came into being under the influence of the LXX ( 145 ) so that writers spoke `` generally of male activity with males rather than specifically categorized male sexual engagement with paides '' ( 146 ) . If arsenokoitai and paidophthoria were interchangeable , it is because the former encompassed the latter ( 146 ) . In summary , Wright seeks to show that arsenokoitai is a broad term meaning homosexuality and arises with Judaism . The views of Boswell , Scroggs , and others who limit the term to `` active male prostitutes '' or pederasty are without significant support from linguistic and historical studies . [ Next : the questioning of Wrights position by William Peterson . After that , we get into the `` good '' stuff of historical & linguistic studies . THis will include `` Symposium '' by Plato . If there is any doubt as to the modern understanding of homosexuality being understood or contemmplated at the time of Paul , this will certainly clear things up . Also we will review Paul 's use of Lev18-20 in the NT and how , as for him , 1 ) the Law was fulfilled , but not done away with , 2 ) Lev 18-20 was the universal and the following chapters the general . Those who put forth that the OT no longer holds true today in our culture , should stick around for this one . ] ___________________________ 13 R. Scroggs , THe New Testament and Homosexuality ( Phil : 1983 ) 86 , 107-8 . Independently we came to the same conclusion . Apparently the connection is made in E.A . Sophocles , Greek Lexicon of the Roman & Byzantine Periods ( from 146BC to AD 1100 ) . 14 See discussion , 101-4 . He says the same thing about Paul 's language in Rom 1:26-27 ( 128 ) . But this is doubtful . See the more cautious words of P. Zaas , `` I Cor 6.9ff : Was Homosexuality Condoned in the Corinthian Church ? SBLASP 17 ( 1979 ) :205-12 . He observes that the words moixai , malakoi , and arsenokoitai were part of Jewish anti-Gentile polemic . Yet Paul 's wors at the end of the vice list , `` and such were some of you , '' indicate that `` Paul is addressing real or potential abuses of his ethical message , not citing primitive tradition by rote '' ( 210 ) . Wright disputes Zaas ' attempt to associate the term with idolatry ( 147 ) . 15 On Boswell 's treatment of Rom 1:26-7 , the article by R.B . Hays , `` Relations Natural and Unnatural '' A Response to John Boswell 's Exegesis of Romans 1 , '' JRE 14/1 ( Spring 1986 ) : 184-215 , is an excellent critique . 16 D.F . Wright , `` Homosexuals or Prostitutes ? The Meaning of ARSENOKOITAI ( I Cor 6:9 , I Tim 1:10 ) , VC 38 ( 1984 ) :125-53 . 17 In an unpublished paper , Henry Mendell , `` ARSENOKOITAI : Boswell on Paul , '' effectively refutres Boswell 's claims regarding the philology of arsenokoitai . He finds the meaning to be general , `` a male who has sex with a male '' ( 4-11 ) . 18 Wright 's endnotes ( 148-49 ) list additional sources in the church fathers . 19 We also have noticed the same tendency by Boswell to fail to cite all the references to Sodom and sodomy in the Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha . See J.B. DeYoung , `` A Critique of Prohomosexual Interpretations of the OT Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha , '' BSac 146/588 ( 1990 ) :437-53 . 20 In light of the claim made by Boswell that the infrequency of arsenokoitai points to a meaning lacking homosexual significance , Wright asks pertinently '' why neither Philo nor Josephus use paidofthoria , nor Josephus paiderastia , and why . . Clement did not use the latter and Chrysostom the former ?

I for one am glad to see this happen , and hope more > umpires will do as Hirschbeck did in instructing the pitcher to pitch if > the batter wo n't get back in the box . While I can see why they want to cut down on the time spent walking around , Gant was n't ordered back in the box `` sooner '' , he was ordered back immediately . As soon as he stepped out , Hirschbeck told him to get back in the box . Now , Gant does n't take a lot of walks between pitches . The only reason he did then because he was *very* bothered by the call . I expect his concentration was n't there yet , and in a crucial situation I imagine it's best to be as calm as possible . Contributing factors would be Gant's bad day at the plate , bad year at the plate , and the Braves long scoring drought . Now , it 's pretty stupid to go ahead and talk the walk when the umpire is telling you to get in there . You know the umpire is going to do something ( call for a strike , throw you out , etc. ) . Gant was wrong . But Hirschbeck was more wrong , in my biased view . Aside from the major chip he seemed to have on his shoulder , what was the problem . Gant had a reason to want some time ( disputed strike call ) . Gant had n't been wasting time all game . The game had been cruising along , and was just over two hours old . The score was 1-0 , with 2 outs in the ninth and a runner in scoring position . Is there *any* reason Hirschbeck could n't , and should n't , cut Gant a little slack ? For no discernible constructive reason , Hirschbeck disrupted the game , caused a five minute delay , and materially hurt the batter in a key situation . Did he have a date to get to ? And I still wonder why Terry was tossed earlier in the game . -- Dale J.

From : s127 @ ii.uib.no ( Torgeir Veimo ) Subject : virtual sound Keywords : virtual sound , surround sound Organization : Institutt for Informatikk UIB Norway Lines : 31 I 'm looking for algorithms or articles on virtual sound . What i want to do is the following ; From a fast source , eg . a CDROM , several sound sources are read , each having it 's own defined position and other attributes , eg . direction etc . Given the listeners position and direction , the sum of sound played back in each of the listeners earphones will be a function of this position and direction . This means that some simulation of the ears coloring of sound relative to it's incoming direction have to be done for each sound source . ( I think this is possible to do with a lookup table of impulse responses for several angles relative to each ear , and interpolate an impulse function from this for a given angle . This impulse function could then be convoluted with the sound from the source . This impulse function must be changed every time some sound source changes position or the listener changes orientation . ) Additionally some reflection , diffusion and absorbtion due to the environment wich is defined could be simulated , but this requires some sort of sound propagandation simulation , kinda like some radiosity algorithm . Have someone done this and/or written articles on implementing such a system ? Please post or mail any answers or comments . -- Torgeir Veimo Studying at the University of Bergen '' ...

To accomodate AIX version 3.2 , we have created a patch to the sources . The patch and accompanying instructions for its application can be retrieved at no charge via anonymous-ftp from the internet host emsworth.andrew.cmu.edu ( 128.2.45.40 ) in the directory ./aixpatch . For those without internet access , a 3.5 '' diskette can be ordered for $ 10 by sending , or faxing , a purchase order to the address below . The base 5.1 system can be ordered from us as a CDrom or ftp'ed from the same host . Note that this patch adds no additional functionality but simply allows AUIS to compile under AIX3.2 . -- -- -- -- -- - The Andrew User Interface System ( AUIS ) is a comprehensive environment on top of X11 windows in which you can create , use , and mail multi-media applications and documents . A major advantage of AUIS is the capability to recursively embed objects . Thus , one can edit text that not only contains multiple fonts , indentation , and other typography , but also contains embedded raster images , spreadsheets , drawing editors , equations , simple animations , and so on . These embedded objects can themselves contain other objects , including text . AUIS has three components : The Andrew User Environment is an integrated and extensible set of applications beginning with the ez text editor , a help system , a system monitoring tool , an editor-based shell interface , and other editors corresponding to the various available types of objects . The Andrew Toolkit ( ATK ) is a portable , object-oriented user-interface toolkit that provides the architecture wherein objects can be embedded in one-another . With the toolkit , programmers can create new objects that can be embedded as easily as those that come with the system . The Andrew Message System ( AMS ) provides a multi-media interface to mail and bulletin-boards . AMS supports several mail management strategies and implements many advanced features including authentication , return receipts , automatic sorting of mail , vote collection and tabulation , enclosures , audit trails of related messages , and subscription management . It also provides a variety of interfaces that support ttys and low-function personal computers in addition to high-function workstations . The current public release of Andrew , Version 5.1 , includes support for the new Internet MIME ( Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions ) standards for multipart , multimedia mail . A newer release , 5.2 , for members of the Andrew Consortium has numerous additional features including new editors for drawings , images , fonts , and user preferences . Remote Andrew Demo Service You can try out Andrew from your own work station via the Remote Andrew Demo Service . You need a host machine on the Internet running the X11 window system . You 'll be able to compose multimedia documents , navigate through the interactive Andrew Tour , and use the Andrew Message System to browse through a few of CMU 's four thousand bulletin boards and newsgroups . To get started with the Remote Andrew Demo service , simply run the following command on your machine : finger help @ atk.itc.cmu.edu The service will give you further instructions .

From : k21701 @ kyyppari.hkkk.fi ( Teppo Nieminen ) Subject : Kawi KZ 750 partial engine disassembly ? Organization : Helsinki School of Economics and Business Administration , Finland Keywords : Kawasaki Lines : 25 My Kawasaki KZ 750 L4 has 2-3 millimetres of play on the gearchange pedal axle , in other words , I can move the axle sideways & up-and-down for few millimetres to each direction . This does n't bother me when riding , but I guess fixing it would n't hurt . Last summer I took the bike to a shop to have the valves adjusted , and the mechanic mentioned that it should be an easy job . All I would have to do is to remove the front sprocket cover and replace a bushing or a seal that I would find there . Well , upon a closer inspection I discovered that the gearchange axle does n't even run through the sprocket cover . It seems that , in addition to removing the cover , I would have at least to remove the sprocket and then the cover that is behind the sprocket . Question : Would removing this small cover from the left side of the engine enable me to lay my hands on that bushing/seal ( Do n't know the exact term in english , sorry ) ? Question : Has anybody done this disassembly job for this or some other purpose ? Does the oil , for example , stay inside the engine ? Thanks ! Teppo Nieminen DoD # 2000 Zoo Mc Helsinki Finland

Simply put , I do not see any way that a `` Platonic essence '' could have any *real* existance . `` Essence '' in the Platonic sense does not have any referent as far as I can tell - it is just an imaginary concept invented to provide an explanation for things better explained in other ways . So , to attribute an 'essence ' to God is to attribute to him something that does not exist ! ! Thus the orthodox Platonic formulation seems to leave the unity of God in limbo , since it is based on a non-existant 'essence ' , thus failing to avoid the very problem it was supposed to address . Thus , to me , the unity of God must be primary , and the triality must be secondary , must be modal or aspectual ( relating to roles , or to modes of interaction ) , since otherwise there is no meaning to saying God is one . -- sarima @ teradata.com ( formerly tdatirv ! sarima ) or Stanley.Friesen @ ElSegundoCA.ncr.com [ I think one can read Augustine as saying something consistent with your comments .

Biden 's statement were quoted by the Washington Post today : Let me put it plainly , Mr. Secretary . You are required to speak diplomatically ; I am not . I can not even begin to express to you my contempt for a European policy that is now asking us to participate in what amounts to a codification of the Serbian victory . ... What you have encountered is a discouraging mosaic of indifference , timidity , self-delusion and hypocrisy . ... After they held our coats on Kuwait and Somalia , they are asking us to put in a few thousand troops on the ground in order to have the right to speak and in order to implement their new idea of 'safe havens ' for the Bosnians ... Let 's not mince words . European policy is based on cultural and religious indifference , if not bigotry . And I think it 's fair to say that this would be an entirely different situation if the Muslims were doing what the Serbs have done , if this was Muslim aggression instead of Serbian aggression . Too bad the Washington Post did not include his next sentence , which pointed out that a consequence of such policy is a rising anger within the Islamic world , the consequences of which we can not begin to predict . Later , Biden told a reporter why he spoke out : I think someone has to respond to Europe to make it clear this is a big deal ... so they will understand . and it IS a big deal . By refusing the fundamental human right of self-defense to Bosnia-Herzegovina , Europe and the world have aided the Serbian aggression . Moreover , the arms embargo has forced a situation in which Bosnian Serbs have 10 times more heavy weaponry than Bosnian Croats and Muslims combined . Under such conditions , it is very easy for Serbs to play a `` divide-and-conquer '' game , and to get the Muslims and Croats ( who have strong common interests and who were allied against the Serbian aggression ) to start fighting each other , which leads to their mutual catastrophe . One final quote : U.S. Secretary of State , Warren Christopher , has said in Rome last week that `` In practice , the embargo had the opposite effect intended . It made aggression certain . '' All diplomats who deluded themselves that they could negotiate peace while enforcing a 10:1 imbalance of power on the ground have contributed to this tragedy . Sincerely , -Josip

Yes it has to be very clear ( like it was n't there ) . And of course , cost is always a factor . I am trying to get an idea of the feasability of such an idea .

If you only have one disk , then you ca n't use Level II SFT . However , the OSOBJ disk has a serial number on it , and if this disk is for a different version of NetWare then you would get a serialization error . Make sure that this disk actually belongs to the rest of the set of floppies in the NetWare installation set . WM > 2 .

Try disconnecting the failed drive , using a standard disk controller , and installing the software as one volume under SFT I .

David gives good explaination of the deductions from the isotropic , 'edged ' distribution , to whit , they are either part of the Universe or part of the Oort cloud . Why could n't they be Earth centred , with the edge occuring at the edge of the gravisphere ? I know there is n't any mechanism for them , but there is n't a mechanism for the others either . What on Earth is the `` gravisphere '' ? Anyway , before it 's decay the Pioneer Venus Orbiter had a gamma ray detector , as does Ulysses , they detect the brightest bursts that the Earth orbit detectors do , so the bursts are at least at Oort cloud distances . In principle four detectors spaced out by a few AU would see parallax if the bursts are of solar system origin . _The_ problem with Oort cloud sources is that absolutely no plausible mechanism has been proposed . It would have to involve new physics as far as I can tell . Closest to '' conventional '' Oort sources is a model of B-field pinching by comets , it 's got too many holes in it to count , but at least it was a good try ... * Steinn Sigurdsson Lick Observatory * * steinly @ lick.ucsc.edu '' standard disclaimer '' * * The laws of gravity are very , very strict * * And you 're just bending them for your own benefit - B.B . 1988*
