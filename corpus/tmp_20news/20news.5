I pointed out the secession movement in Aceh which has also been brutally dealt with in the past by the Indonesian government . The harshly with all secessionist movements . the evidence , it appears to me that the Indonesian government has dealt very harshly with all secession movements . I know that the head of the Indonesian armed forces for a very long time was Benny Murdani -- a `` Christian '' . Indonesia has been heavy handed in East Timor for a long time , even when Murdani was head of the armed forces .

This also leads to the conspiracy theory that the lawyer had the BATF pinned on rights violations if the BD's acted as witnesses , hence the arson .

That 's what gets me too . It is likely the cult members were holed up in an enforced place inside the building . With a decent arson attempt I suspect many of them could have been trapped . In addition , the introduction of CS gas for several hours would have rendered many of them immobile if not unconscious when their masks quit . All the props are there , but proving what scene was played is difficult .

My views on this topic have evolved and clarified through this , and I suspect that we may not disagree as much as we think . I admit that I 'm strongly prejudiced against evangelical Christianity , and I may not always be rational in my reactions to it . I grew up in EC , and went to an EC college . It was definitely the wrong place for me , and I react strongly to any implication that EC or conservative Christianity has any sort of stronghold on true Christianity . I shudder when I remember the condescending attitude I had about other Christians who did n't adhere to the EC model . I have come to see that my real objection to this whole notion of absolute truth is the actions I have seen it lead to . I have had some very bad experiences with evangelical Christians claiming to know the truth , and judging me or others based on their belief that they have the answers . Knowing the truth does n't seem to leave a whole lot of room for others ' opinions . I can accept your belief in absolute truth as long as you* do n't try to use that belief to try to force others to comply with it , and you are very careful that you do n't hurt others with it . Love your neighbor seems to go totally out the window when one knows the truth and believes that everyone should be living by that truth . Other people have convictions about the truth every bit as strong and sincere as yours , based on careful searching , prayer , and their relationship with God .

Hello duo owners ( and Apple technical people : - ) I have a new duo 230 which appears to have a problem waking up from sleep when running on battery power . When woken ( usually for the second time ) after sleeping , the wake fails and the screen appears with a corrupted image of broken horizontal lines and control can only be recovered with control-command-poweron or the reset key at the back of the machine . The problem occurs even when the system is stock standard ( no extensions , no virtual memory , a fully charged new battery , system 7.1 etc ) . I have not had the problem when the machine is plugged in to AC . I 've checked that the battery is properly seated ( it appears to be fine ) . What 's going on here ? Anyone else had this problem ? Is it software or hardware ? If you have a duo 230 and a bit of time , try repeatedly sleeping and waking the machine on battery power and let me know if you see the same behaviour ( and let Apple know too ! ) . Many thanks to anyone who can clear this one up for me .

Thanks . A program in the archive keymap00.zip on simtel and mirror sites in the msdos/keyboard directory will do this . It is written in assembler and it best if you have a compiler to create a new keyboard map . It is possible , however , to use a binary editor to edit the provided compiled keyboard driver if you do not have a compiler . I used hexed100.zip , also available on simtel . Simply serach for the codes 00 01 02 03 to locate the biginning of the `` normal '' keyboard map . Then swap the codes for the keys that you wish to swap . See the keyboard directory of simtel for programs that report the scancode for each key to you ( some bios programs also have this info ) .

Your assumption is that this `` low '' dollar/pound area is sufficiently low as to make gun-running unprofitable . On what do you base this ?

Wow , you got ta love the speculation . As I posted before , we import billions upon billions of raw ores across the Mexican border . Not only that but ships come in and out of U.S. harbors every day full stuff . And customs does n't even have the extra advantage of being able to sniff them out . I 'd be willing to wager that a shipload of handguns would be worth more than a shipload of raw ore , *and* you 're virtually guaranteed to get it past customs , because they 'd have to hand search every hold of every ship which came through . It 's not simply a matter of how much money are they worth , but how much *more* money are they worth than other goods , based on the likelihood of being caught . Less money than drugs , but also a safer thing to smuggle . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- David Veal Univ . of Tenn.

Do you have a terminal cold ? Karabag is 'Turkish ' and will remain 'Turkish ' . Here we are , almost at the end of the 20th century , and a whole community , the Azeri Turks of x-Soviet Armenia and Karabag , is facing forced assimilation , torture and murder on one hand and forced exodus , expulsion and genocide on the other , all because of their ethnic and religious background . And one should ask herself : is the world community really so powerless ? Where are all those human rights advocates ? Where are all the decent people ? Are we going to let this human tragedy go on and do nothing about it ? The number of Azeris murdered by the terrorist Armenian army and its savage gangs is increasing . On the one hand they wish to distort the truth and on the other , they beg mercy from Turkiye . The Age ... Melbourne ... 6/3/92 By Helen WOMACK ... . Agdam , Azerbaijan , Thursday The exact number of victims is still unclear , but there can be little doubt that Azeri civilians were massacred by Armenian fighters in the snowy mountains of Nagorno-Karabakh last week . Refugees from the enclave town of Khojaly , sheltering in the Azeri border town of Agdam , give largely consistent accounts of how their enemies attacked their homes on the night of 25 February , chased those who fled and shot them in the surrounding forests . Yesterday , I saw 75 freshly dug graves in one cemetery in addition to four mutilated corpses we were shown in the mosque when we arrived in Agdam late on Tuesday . I also saw women and children with bullet wounds in a makeshift hospital in a string of railway carriages . Khojaly , an Azeri settlement in the enclave mostly populated by Armenians , had a population of about 6000 . Mr. Rashid Mamedov Commander of Police in Agdam , said only about 500 escaped to his town. `` So where are the rest ? '' . Some might have taken prisoner , he said , or fled . Many bodies were still lying in the mountains because the Azeris were short of helicopters to retrieve them . He believed more than 1000 had perished , some of cold in temperatures as low as minus 10 degrees . One refugee , Rami Nasiru , described how Khojaly residents at first thought the attack was no more than the routine shooting to which they had become accustomed in four years of conflict . But when they saw the Armenians with a convoy of armored personnel carriers , they realised they could not hope to defend themselves with machineguns and grenades , and fled into the forests . In the small hours , the massacre started . Mr. Nasiru , who believes his wife and two children were taken prisoner , repeated what many other refugees have said - that troops of the former Soviet army helped the Armenians to attack Khojaly . `` It is not my opinion , I saw it with my own eyes . '' Serdar Argic 'We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the Turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination .

From : JEK @ cu.nih.gov Subject : When are two people married Lines : 128 LISTOWNER : I have sent this to Mr Anderson privately . Post it only if you think it of general interest . Here is a copy of something I wrote for another list . You may find it relevant . A listmember asks : > What makes common-law marriages wrong ? A common-law marriage is not necessarily wrong in itself . There is nothing in the Bible ( Old or New Testament ) about getting married by a preacher , or by a priest ( Jewish or Christian ) . And in fact Jewish priests have never had any connection with weddings . There is a common notion that the marriage is performed by the clergyman . In fact , the traditional Christian view ( at least in the West ) is that the bride and groom are the ministers of the marriage , and that the clergyman is there only as a witness . HOWEVER ! The essential ingredient of a marriage is mutual commitment . Two persons are considered to be married if and only if they have bound themselves by mutual promises to live together as husband and wife , forsaking all others , till death do them part . The reason why those who have reason to be concerned about who is married to whom have always insisted on some kind of public ceremony is in order that society , and the couple themselves , may be clear about whether a commitment has been made . Suppose that we do away with the public ceremony , the standard vows , etc . Instead , we have a man and a woman settling down to live together . After a year or so , the man says to the woman : Hey , honey , it was great while it lasted , but I think it 's time to move on . She says : What are you talking about ? He says : I am leaving you and looking for someone prettier and younger . She says : But you ca n't . We are married ! He says : What are you talking about ? We never got married . She says : I remember distinctly what you said to me the night we first made love . You said : `` My love for you is as deep as the ocean , as eternal as the stars . As long as I live , I am yours , utterly and completely . When I lie on my deathbed , my last feeble breath will utter your name . My ... '' He says : Oh that ! That was just rhetoric . Just poetry . When a man is in a romantic mood , he is bound to say all kinds of silly things like that . You must n't take them literally . And that is why you have an insistence on a formal ceremony that is a matter of public record . The Church insists on it , because it is her duty ( among other things ) to give moral advice , and you can not give a man moral advice about his relations with a woman if you have no idea who is married to whom , if anybody , and vice versa . The State insists on it , since the state has a concern with property rights , with child care and support , and therefore needs to know who has made what commitments to whom . Prospective fathers-in-law insist on it , because they don't want their daughters seduced and abandoned . Prospective spouses insist on it , because they want to make sure they know whether what they are hearing is a real commitment , or just `` poetry . '' And persons making vows themselves insist on making them formally and publicly , in order that they may be clear in their own minds about what it is that they are doing , and may know themselves that this is not just rhetoric . This is the real thing . Hence the insistence on a formal public explicit avowal of the marriage commitment . The Church goes further and insists that , when Christians marry , a clergyman shall be present at the wedding and record the vows on behalf of the Church , not because it is impossible to have a valid wedding without a clergyman , but in order to make sure that the couple understand what the Christian teaching about marriage is , and that they are in fact promising to be married in a Christian sense . The Church also prefers a standard marriage vow , and is wary of letting couples Write their own vows , for much the same reason that lawyers prefer standard terminology when they draw up a will or a contract . Certain language has been repeatedly used in wills , and one can be sure how the courts will interpret it . Try to say the same thing in your own words , and you may find that the probate judge 's interpretation of them is not at all what you intended . Similarly , the Church prefers to avoid endless debates about whether `` You are my main squeeze '' and `` I am here for the long haul '' do in fact cover the same territory as `` forsaking all others '' and `` till death do us part . '' This topic has come up on the list before . ( Is there any topic that has n't ? ) One listmember was asking , `` If a couple love each other and are living together , is n't that marriage in the eyes of God ? '' Eventually someone asked , `` In that case , what is their status if they break up ? Is that the moral equivalent of getting a divorce ? Are they in a relationship that God forbids either of them to walk out on ? `` The original questioner said : `` Good grief , I never thought of that ! '' In fact , there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that someone who says , `` We do n't need a piece of paper or a ceremony in front of a judge or a preacher in order to show that we love each other , '' is trying to have it both ways -- to have the advantages of marriage plus the option of changing his mind with a minimum of bother . At this point someone may say , `` None of this applies to me and my mate . We are quite clear on the fact that we have assumed a lifelong commitment , 'for better or worse , forsaking all others , till death us do part . ' So in our case , no ceremony is needed . '' To this my reply would be : The reason for requiring a driver's license is to keep dangerous drivers off the road . What is wrong in itself is not the existence of unlicensed drivers , but the existence of dangerous drivers . However , testing and licensing drivers is an obvious and reasonable means of pursuing the goal of reducing the number of dangerous drivers on the road . Therefore the State rightly makes and enforces such laws , and you the citizen have a positive moral obligation to refrain from driving without a license no matter how much of a hotshot behind the wheel you think you are . Back to the original question . We have a listmember who knows a couple who have been living together for around 20 years . He asks : At what point did they stop fornicating and start being married ? I answer : at the point , if any , where they both definitely and explicitly accepted an obligation to be faithful to each other , for better or worse , as long as they both lived . If they have accepted such an obligation , what are their reasons for not being willing to declare it in front of , say , a justice of the peace ? Yours , James Kiefer

What I disagree with is your statement that the U.S. Media is out to ruin Israels reputation . That is rediculous . The U.S. media is the most pro-israeli media in the world . Having lived in Europe I realize that incidences such as the one described in the letter have occured . The U.S. media as a whole seem to try to ignore them . The U.S. is subsidizing Israels existance and the Europeans are not ( at least not to the same degree ) . So I think that might be a reason they report more clearly on the atrocities . What is a shame is that in Austria , daily reports of the inhuman acts commited by Israeli soldiers and the blessing received from the Government makes some of the Holocaust guilt go away . After all , look how the Jews are treating other races when they got power . It is unfortunate .

I 'm not sure about this . If the ground connections on the outlets are connected to anything , they should be connected to a wire that runs back to the main panel , where it is bonded to the neutral connector and to the house ground rod . A connection to a local earth ground would not necessarily meet one of the goals of the ground wire , which is that if a short develops from hot to the ground wire , enough current would flow to trip the breaker .

They come into this state of affairs by overordering either accidentally or deliberatly to get a better wholsale price from Apple . In either case they often obscure the serial nunber to protect their identity . As a result the warranty is void . You may save on sales tax but you have to pay for shipping . I should also point out that mail order companies can not get lower prices thatn the high volume authorised dealers unless they buy below dealer cost . As a result the only way they can sell cheaper is by cutting costs and trimming margins . Unfortunatly they dont seem to be doing too well . The lowest prices I have been quoted mailorder do not beat the lowest prices available from authorised local dealers . They are even further away from educational prices . -ERik Speckman

At the same dinner , Clarke said that his worst mistake in Philadelphia was letting Mike Keenan go -- in retrospect , almost all players came realize that Keenan knew what it took to win . Rumours are now circulating that Keenan will be back with the Flyers . Nick Polano is sick of being a scapegoat for the schedule made for the Red Wings ; After all , Bryan Murray approved it . Gerry Meehan and John Muckler are worried over the Sabres ' prospects ; Assistant Don Lever says that the Sabres have to get their share now , because a Quebec dynasty is emerging ... The Mighty Ducks have declared that they will not throw money around loosely to buy a team . Oilers coach Ted Green remarked that `` There some guys around who can fill Tie Domi 's skates , but none who can fill his helmet .

In fact , it is the fact that hospitals frequently compete for physicians rather than for patients that ( in part ) complicates and undermines a simplistic free-market analysis of the market for medical care . > Hospitals tend to lose money on all sorts of high-tech , high-price > machinery . They manage to make it up on other charges . Once again , there is no evidence that this is true in regard to kidney dialysis . Although price controls have promoted an expansion of services to a much greater volume of patients , RD is still a profitable service . Otherwise , one would expect to see evidence of rationing rather than the vast expansion that has occurred . > > > Remember , the notion that you can lose a little on each treatment but > > make it up in volume is not good economics even in a free market . : ) > > Then how do you explain why grocery stores routinely offer an > array of products at prices below cost ? Are not grocery stores > embedded in a relatively free market ? Can you spell `` loss leader ? '' I knew you could . Grocery stores do not attempt to make up the loss on an individual product by selling more of it . In fact , your argument above is that kidney dialysis is a loss leader for other medical treatments where lost revenue can be regained . But the evidence does not support this contention . Rather , it appears that price controls have disciplined the market by forcing an expansion of service and development of improved lower-cost technology to provide comparable benefits . Providers continue to profit from RD , they simply make less on each treatment than they would have if the price had risen at the rate that uncontrolled treatments have . There is no question that had price controls forced the price of RD substantially below its actual cost that some or all of the doomsday predictions of free-market advocates would have been seen -- restriction of service , lagging technological development , etc . Likewise , it appears that in the VA and armed forces medical care systems , where providers are government agencies , some of these negative impacts may occur . ( RD patients in the VA system in Spokane , for example , must travel to Seattle , 300 miles away , for treatment . ) The bottom line , however , is that this is an example of government intervention ( of a rather extreme sort ) that appears to have had beneficial results for both providers and consumers . Claims that `` government bureaucracy '' inevitably leads to undesirable outcomes in the marketplace should take such such cases into account . jsh > > =Mark -- Steve Hendricks | DOMAIN : steveh @ thor.ISC-BR.COM '' One thing about data , it sure does cut| UUCP : ... ! uunet ! isc-br ! thor ! steveh the bulls**t.

The system that looks the most interesting is the Budget 486/66 VLB tower . For about $ 2343 ( delivered ) it offers VLB , 8MB , 200MB IDE , a Mitsumi CD-ROM ( with software bundle ) , Media Vision Sound board , 14 '' CTX 1468NI , 128K Cache , and the usual drives , ports , & OS software . Since my budget is $ 2350 for a system , it seems almost too good to be true ( which may mean it IS too good to be true , of course ) . Among other things , I 've never seen a review of the Budget systems ( or their parent company , Micro Smart ) , or of the motherboard they are using ( the Aetana ) . Any feedback would be appreciated . In a similar vein , the second system I 'm considering Midwest Micro's Elite VESA 486/66 tower with a Diamond Viper ( 2MB ) & Midwest Micro 14 '' MI monitor is one I 've never seen reviewed anywhere . I 'm familiar with the firm but not the product line - and some idea of their quality would be abig benefit here as well .

Well , I did n't bother writing to Boxer , Feinstein or Eshoo , the terrible trio who allegly represent me . Instead , I wrote to Bentsen . My letter was not exactly strongly-worded ; I simply stated that the BATF approach was immoral ( military-style assault , firing into a house where they knew there were kids ) .

Lines : 24 NNTP-Posting-Host : thing1.cc.utexas.edu It is illegal to use anything you eavedropped on for a business or for an illegal use . Jurisdictions that ban radar detectors or police monitors , are essentially making the claim that there is no other reason for a radar detector or police radio monitor . The results of fighting these claims in courts have been mixed . The federal courts are not anxious to intervene and state courts have sometimes held that the feds have exclusive jurisdiction and sometimes they have not . A lot of state courts do not have enough imagination to see any use for a radar detector besides avoiding law enforcement action for speeding . When you buy a radar detector , amongst the guarrantees , instructions , explanations , and other detritus , is an invitation to join an association dedicated to preserving your right to use a radar detector . ( I promise I am not making this up ! ) I do not think radar detector manufacturers would be making any headway at all in courtrooms if police departments enforced speed laws with a strict eye to public safety and a blind eye to the fund raiser aspect of tickets .

There was an interesting column on the editorial page of the Dallas Morning News on Saturday by Walter Williams , who I believe is a professor at Georgetown ( I wonder if he knows of Dorothy `` you 're not in Kansas anymore '' Denning ) . The article was titled `` Government slowly eroding our liberties '' , and in it he tells a story attributed to the late Leonard Read who explained that if you wanted to take liberty away from Americans , you had to know how to cook a frog . Mr. Read said you ca n't cook a frog by boiling a pot of water and then throwing the frog in . His reflexes are so quick that as soon as his feet touch the water , he will leap away . You must put the frog in a pot of cold water and heat it up bit by bit . By the time the frog realizes he 's being cooked , it is too late . It is the same with Americans . If anyone tried to take our freedoms all at once , we would naturally rebel and suppress the tyrant . But as with successful frog cooking , our liberties can be taken a little bit at a time . The last line of the article says , `` It 's not too late for us , but the water is getting pretty warm . '' I 'd have toagree that it 's warm and the Clipper is keeping the temperature on an upward course .

Could > someone explain what the Command Loss Timer is ? The name is rather descriptive . It 's a command to the spacecraft that tells it `` If you do n't hear from Earth after 264 hours , assume something is wrong with your ( the spacecraft ) attitude , and go into a preprogrammed search mode in an attempt to reacquire the signal from Earth . '' The spacecraft and Earth are not in constant communication with each other . Earth monitors the telemetry from the spacecraft , and if everything is fine , there 's no reason to send it any new information . But from the spacecraft's point of view , no information from Earth could mean either everything is fine , or that the spacecraft has lost signal acquisition . Just how long should the spacecraft wait before it decides that something is wrong and begins to take corrective action ? That `` how long '' is the command loss timer . During relatively inactive cruise phases , the command loss timer can be set to rather long values . In this case , Earth is telling Galileo `` expect to hear back from us sometime within the next 264 hours '' .

If you have an idea about its voltage and current ratings , e.g . 60VDC @ 6A , you can probably get away with replacing it with anything with better specs . Early MOSFETS had a gate-source voltage rating of approximately +/- 20 VDCmax , and they would usually turn completely `` ON '' at +10VDC . Otherwise , MOSFETS are not really mysterious -- they 're more or less voltage controlled current sources . If the MOSFET in your circuit is used as an open-loop , voltage controlled current source , you may have to experiment with various gain-altering techniques .

It 's not fully up to date with all the new variations ( some of which are just different manufacturer 's synonyms ) : -- -- -- In practical terms , ignoring the technological details , this is my view of the families ( NB I am not a giant corporation , which influences my views on things like availability and backward compatibility ) : 74 The original . Speed good , power consumption fair . Effectively obsolete now ; use 74LS or later , except for a *very* few oddball functions like 7407 which are hard to find in newer families . 74H Modification of 74 for higher speed , at the cost of higher power consumption . Very obsolete ; use 74F . 74L Modification of 74 for lower power , at the cost of lower speed . Very obsolete ; use CMOS . 74S Later modification of 74 for even higher speed , at some cost in power consumption . Effectively obsolete ; use 74F . 74LS Combination of 74L and 74S , for speed comparable to 74 with lower power consumption . Best all-round TTL now , widest variety of devices . 74F Fast as blazes , power not too bad . The clear choice for high speed in TTL . Availability and prices generally good . 74AS Failed competitor to 74F , although a few 74AS parts do things that are hard to find in 74F and thus are still useful . 74ALS Possible replacement for 74LS . Generally souped up . Still fairly new , availability and prices possibly a problem . 74C Fairly old family , CMOS devices with TTL pinouts . Competed with 4000 series , not too successfully . Obsolete ; use 4000 or newer CMOS 74 families . 4000 ( Thrown in as the major non-74 non-ECL logic family . ) The old CMOS family , still viable because of *very* wide range of devices , low power consumption , and wide range of supply voltages . Not fast . Very forgiving and easy to work with ( beware static electricity , but that comment applies to many other modern logic families too ) . There are neat devices in this family that exist in no other . The clear choice when speed is not important . 74HC A new attempt at 74-pinout CMOS . Fast compared to old CMOS , power consumption often lower than TTL . Possibly a good choice for general-purpose logic , assuming availability and affordability . CMOS logic levels , *not* TTL ones . Beware very limited range of supply voltages compared to older CMOS , also major rise of power consumption at faster speeds . 74HCT 74HC with TTL logic levels . Much the same comments as 74HC . Read the fine print on things like power consumption -- TTL compatibility in CMOS involves some compromises . 10K ( Thrown in for speed freaks . ) The low end of ECL . Various sources claim that it is *easier* to work with than super-fast TTL for serious high-speed work . Less forgiving , though : read and follow the rules or it wo n't work . Availability to hobbyists limited , can be expensive . 100K ( For real speed freaks . ) Hot ECL . Harder to handle than 10K , and inconvenient packages . Much more useful datasheets , however . As for compatibility between families : the 74 families ( except 74C and 74HC ) are all more or less logic-level compatible , but how many 74X devices you can drive from one 74Y output varies enormously with X and Y . You just have to read the specs and do the arithmetic . 74C and 74HC are compatible with the others with a bit of hassle . 4000 compatibility can be a bit of hassle or a lot of hassle depending on what supply voltage 4000 is using . 10K or 100K to anything else is considerable hassle . Me ? I use 4000 and 74LS with a sprinkling of 74F . 74HC [ T ] and 10K are interesting but I have n't used either significantly yet . -- All work is one man 's work . | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology - Kipling | henry @ zoo.toronto.edu utzoo ! henry

On April 9 , real-time commands were sent , as planned , to reacquire celestial reference after completion of the Low Gain Antenna ( LGA-2 ) swing/Dual Drive Actuator ( DDA ) hammer activities . 2 . On April 9 , the EJ-1 ( Earth-Jupiter # 1 ) sequence memory load was uplinked to the spacecraft without incident . This sequence covers spacecraft activity from April 12 , 1993 to June 14 , 1993 and includes a window for the Radio Relay Antenna ( RRA ) slew test on April 28 , 1993 . The command loss timer was set to 11 days as a part of this sequence memory load . 3 . On April 12 and 15 , a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to 264 hours , its planned value during this mission phase . 4 . On April 12 , cruise science Memory Readouts ( MROs ) were performed for the Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer ( EUV ) , Dust Detector ( DDS ) , and Magnetometer ( MAG ) instruments . Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly . 5 . On April 12 , an Ultra-Stable Oscillator ( USO ) test was performed to verify the health status of the USO and to collect gravitational red shift experiment data ; long term trend analysis is continuing . 6 . On April 14 , a 40bps modulation index test was performed to determine the optimal Signal-to-Noise Ratio ( SNR ) when transmitting at 40bps . Preliminary analysis of the data suggests that the present pre-launch selected modulation index is near the optimal level . 7 . On April 15 , cruise science Memory Readouts ( MROs ) were performed for the Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer ( EUV ) and Magnetometer ( MAG ) instrument . Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly . 8 . On April 15 , a periodic RPM ( Retro-Propulsion Module ) 10-Newton thruster flushing maintenance activity was performed ; all 12 thrusters were flushed during the activity . Thruster performance throughout the activity was nominal . 9 . The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant changes ( greater than 25 DN ) throughout this period . The AC measurement reads 19 DN ( 4.3 volts ) . The DC measurement reads 111 DN ( 12.9 volts ) . These measurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special anomaly team . 10 . The Spacecraft status as of April 15 , 1993 , is as follows : a ) System Power Margin - 60 watts b ) Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin c ) Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner d ) Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 18 degrees off-sun ( lagging ) and 6 degrees off-earth ( leading ) e ) Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps ( coded ) /LGA-1 f ) General Thermal Control - all temperatures within acceptable range g ) RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range h ) Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS , EUV , UVS , EPD , MAG , HIC , and DDS i ) Probe/RRH - powered off , temperatures within acceptable range j ) CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours Time To Initiation - 260 hours GDS ( Ground Data Systems ) : 1 . Galileo participated in a second DSN ( Deep Space Network ) acceptance test for the DSN Telemetry Phase 3 Upgrade on April 13 , 1993 , using CTA-21 ( Compatibility Test Area 21 ) . The purpose of this test was to verify the flow of Galileo telemetry data through the new Telemetry Group Controller ( TGC ) and the Telemetry Channel Assembly ( TCA ) . The TGC/TCA is the replacement for the current Telemetry Processing Assembly ( TPA ) . Seven different telemetry rates were run for this test ; all ran well on both the MTS ( MCCC Telemetry Subsystem ) and the AMMOS MGDS V18.0 GIF with the exception of 10bps . The 10bps rate had some trouble staying in lock ; it appears the TGC/TCA was not metering the data correctly . Further comparisons between the MGDS and MTS data from this test are being conducted . MVT ( Mission Verification Test ) of the TGC/TCA system is expected to begin May 16 , 1993 . TRAJECTORY As of noon Thursday , April 15 , 1993 , the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory status was as follows : Distance from Earth 152,606,000 km ( 1.02 AU ) Distance from Sun 277,519,800 km ( 1.86 AU ) Heliocentric Speed 93,400 km per hour Distance from Jupiter 543,973,900 km Round Trip Light Time 17 minutes , 4 seconds SPECIAL TOPIC 1 . As of April 15 , 1993 , a total of 70184 real-time commands have been transmitted to Galileo since Launch . Of these , 65076 were initiated in the sequence design process and 5108 initiated in the real-time command process . In the past week , 7 real time commands were transmitted : 6 were initiated in the sequence design process and one initiated in the real time command process . Major command activities included commands to reacquire celestial reference , uplink the EJ-1 sequence memory load , and reset the command loss timer . ___ _____ ___ /_ /| /____/ \ /_ /| Ron Baalke | baalke @ kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov | | | | __ \ /| | | | Jet Propulsion Lab | ___| | | | |__ ) |/ | | |__ M/S 525-3684 Telos | Being cynical never helps /___| | | | ___/ | |/__ /| Pasadena , CA 91109 | to correct the situation |_____|/ |_|/ |_____|/ | and causes more aggravation | instead .

According to my always questionable newspaper , there 's a silver dollar being minted in Canada , the back of which commemorates the anniversary of the Stanley Cup . Now , I know full well what coins are used every day in Canada . I can easily fish a few out of my pocket change right now , in fact . My question is , since the loon is the only dollar coin that I know is legal tender , is this just a commemorative coin with no monetary exchange value , or what ? Is it the sort of thing that only hockey buffs and coin collectors might covet , with no chance of it being circulated ? If it is an uncirculated coin , what's the current cost and what 's its potential value ? Just curious .

Can you reference ? However , I found a quote due to Imam Ali , whom the Shias follow : '' Men , never obey your women in any way whatsoever . Never let them give their advice on any matter whatsoever , even those of everyday life . Indeed , allow them freely to give advice on anything and they will fritter away one's wealth and disobey the wishes of the owner of this wealth . We see them without religion , when , alone , they are left to their own devices ; they are lacking in both pity and virtue when their carnal desires are at stake . It is easy to enjoy them , but they cause great anxiety . The most virtious among them are libertines . But the most corrupt are whores . Only those of them whom age has deprived of any charm are untainted by vice . They have three qualities particular to miscreants ; they complain of being oppressed , whereas it is they who oppress ; they make oaths , whereas they are lying ; they pretend to refuse men 's solicitations , whereas they desire them most ardently . Let us beg the help of God to emerge victorious from their evil deeds . And preserve us in any case from their good ones . '' ( Quote from Mas'ud al-Qanawi , ref . A. Bouhdiba , Sexuality in Islam , p. 118 ) . I would n't consider this quote as being exemplary of the Islamic ( TM ) viewpoint though . For all we know , the prophet 's cousin and the Fourth Khalif Hazret-i Ali may have said this after a frustrating night with a woman . Selim Guncer -- Selim E.

Crullerian photography involves putting donuts between grease-covered hot metal plates while illuminating them with a Krypton Stroboscope . Through a unique iteration involving the 4th-dimensional projection of a torus through the semi-stochastic interactions of hot monomolecular lipid layers covering the metal plates ( the best metal is iron since it repels Vampires and Succubi ) the donuts start developing flutes , and within moments actually become poly-crenellated hot greasy breadtubes .

I think a good number of atheists believe there is nothing beyond bodily death , but it is simply an abuse of language to say they believe they 're going to hell . They believe they 're going to _die_ . Understand that you 've turned Hell into a verb . Using the same logic , it also follows that all animals are 'going to Hell . ' Are you sure this is what you want to say ? ( presumably animals do n't have the opportunity to get to heaven , but this still does n't change the fact that they 're going to Hell ( die a final death ) ) I do n't claim to know whether or not there is an afterlife of _some_ sort , but if Hell is as you described ( final death , and not eternal perpetuation of consciousness ) it will be true that there will never be a moment when I am aware of my non-existence . ( assuming I 'go to Hell ' and not to Heaven ) In other words , I'll never know I 'm dead . Hmmm ... > Hell does n't have to be worse than earth to be Hell -- because it 's eternal , Ever hear people say of a loved one who was ill , and has died : `` At least she 's not suffering any more ; She 's in Heaven now . '' ? Consider the following statement : `` At least she 's not suffering any more ; She 's in Hell now . '' The above statement sounds odd , but according to your definition of Hell , it would be a true statement . The person in Hell would not be suffering . Granted , they would n't be *anything* ( would n't be having any conscious experience whatsoever ) . You say Hell ( death ) is eternal . However , this loses its meaning to a dead person . And to me , it seems that the threat of some sort of eternal punishment only makes sense/has force if one expects to be conscious throughout this eternity . Many atheists believe that the thirst for an afterlife is simply the product of propaganda ( `` Friend , do you want the FREE gift of e-ternal life ? '' It 's my understanding that the early jews did not believe in an afterlife . Can anyone back me up on this ? ) combined with the survival instinct all animals share . The difference is we have consciousness , and once we get the idea of eternal life drilled into our brains , we then desire a sort of super-survival . > and it 's a lot worse than Heaven . That 's the only comparison that matters . That would depend on what Heaven is like . If God is a King , and an eternity in heaven consists of giving thanks and praise to the King , I might opt for Hell . I read a lovely account of a missionary trying to convert Eskimos to Christianity in the book _The Illusion of Immortality_ by Corliss Lamont . The missionary started to speak about Heaven . `` Are there seals in heaven ? Will we be able to go hunting ? '' asked an Eskimo . The missionary said no . The group of Eskimos then said something to the effect of , `` Well what good is your Heaven if there 's no hunting ? Scram .

I 've attempted to come to terms with it previously > ( in an attempt to understand it for learning purposes ) and have n't been able > to grasp the reasoning . > It was a gift from God . I think basically the reasoning was that the tradition in the Church held that Mary was also without sin as was Jesus . As the tenets of faith developed , particularly with Augustine , sin was more and more equated with sex , and thus Mary was assumed to be a virgin for life ( since she never sinned , and since she was the spouse of God , etc . ) Since we also had this notion of original sin , ie . that man is born with a predisposition to sin , and since Mary did not have this predisposition because she did not ever sin , she did n't have original sin . When science discovered the process of conception , the next step was to assume that Mary was conceived without original sin , the Immaculate Conception . Mary at that time appeared to a girl named Bernadette at Lourdes . She refered to herself as the Immaculate Conception . Since a nine year old would have no way of knowing about the doctrine , the apparition was deemed to be true and it sealed the case for the doctrine . RCs hold that all revelation comes from two equally important sources , that being Sacred Scripture and Holy Tradition . In this case , mostly tradition . Joe Moore

Well , almost ... . If I only had to solve the problem for myself , and were willing to have to type in a second password ( the secret key ) whenever I logged in , it could work . However , I 'm trying to create a solution that anyone can use , and which , once installed , is just as effortless to start up as the non-solution of just using xhost ( 1 ) to control access . I 've got religeous problems with storing secret keys on multiuser computers . > For a good discussion of cryptographically `` good '' random number > generators , check out the draft-ietf-security-randomness-00.txt > Internet Draft , available at your local friendly internet drafts > repository . Thanks for the pointer ! It was good reading , and I liked the idea of using several unrelated sources with a strong mixing function . However , unless I missed something , the only source they suggested ( aside from a hardware RNG ) that seems available , and unguessable by an intruder , when a Unix is fresh-booted , is I/O buffers related to network traffic . I believe my solution basically uses that strategy , without requiring me to reach into the kernel . > A reasonably source of randomness is the output of a cryptographic > hash function ( e.g. , MD5 ) , when fed with a large amount of > more-or-less random data .

I heard about this solution , and it sounded good . Then I heard that folks were experiencing times of 30-60 seconds to run this , on reasonably-configured workstations . I 'm not willing to add that much delay to someone 's login process . My approach ( etherfind|compress , skip 10K ) takes a second or two to run . I 'm considering writing the be-all and end-all of solutions , that launches the MD5 , and simultaneously tries to suck bits off the net , and if the net should be sitting __SO__ idle that it ca n't get 10K after compression before MD5 finishes , use the MD5 . This way I could have guaranteed good bits , and a deterministic upper bound on login time , and still have the common case of login take only a couple of extra seconds . -Bennett bet @ sbi.com

I think one ( not ideal ) solution is to use the tracing utility ( ca n't remember the name , sorry ! ) included in the Corel Draw s/w pack . It can convert bitmaps to Corel art format . These can then be imported into a drawing rather than the bitmap . Result - the file is completely in Corel format and can be SCODAL'ed no problem ! BUT the slight problem with this , which makes the solution less than idea , is that the trace utility spits out many more points than are necessary to define the shapes being traced . Straight lines and curves are both traced as many short segments . So ... the SCODAL taking *much* longer to image . The obvious solution is time-consuming - stripping out the extra points by hand using Corel . OUCH ! I 've done it a few times : - ] > ...

You might call MCL ; they have a nice catalog . The universal answer for wide-coverage , theory+practice , RF design is the _ARRL Handbook_ , published by the American Radio Relay League , the radio amateur organization .

Ok , here 's what I understand : The SL/SL1/SL2/SW1/SW2 was meant to compete with the following cars : Honda Civic Toyota Tercel ( SL , SL1 ) Toyota Corolla ( SL1 , SL2 ) Nissan Sentra Mazda 323/Protoge' Subaru Loyale/Impreza Isuzu Stylus Geo Prizm Ford Escort Mercury Tracer Mistubishi Mirage Plymouth/Dodge Colt Their core competition is the Civic , Corolla , and Sentra . Most of the other models are in the same class , but are n't the first cars you would think of . I threw in the Escort/Tracer because it has a good amount of Japanese technology and has similar reliability stats . I did n't include domestic small cars such as the Cavalier , Sunbird , Shadow , Sundance , Tempo , and Topaz , since I think Saturn is going after cars that have at least some degree of Japanese roots . The SC1/SC2 was meant to compete against the following cars : Toyota Paseo Honda Civic Si/Civic Coupes/del Sol Si Nissan NX1600/NX2000 Mazda MX-3 Isuzu Impulse Geo Storm Ford Escort GT If you look at the prices of these cars , they 're more expensive than they're 4-door counterparts . The is good reason for this . It is a more upscale and trend-driven market . Even though many of these models are based on sedan platforms , their interior , etc . is good enough to warrant slightly higher prices . Here are some of the platform derivations I can think of : Tercel - > Paseo Sentra - > NX1600/NX2000 Civic - > del Sol 323 - > MX-3 ( not sure on this one ) Stylus - > Impulse/Storm To illustrate , a Tercel starts at around $ 8000 , while the Paseo starts at around $ 11,000 . Even a 4-door Tercel will cost less than a 2-door Paseo . Now , you might be saying that the Tercel does n't offer the power that some 4-doors offer . What I mean is that there is no 4-dr Tercel with a comparable powerplant as its sport coupe derivative . Let 's take another example : the Isuzu Stylus XS and Impulse XS/Storm GSi . Both have the same powerplants ( a 1.6L 140hp engine ) , but the smaller 2-dr coupes are generally more expensive . Again , this is because the two-door sport coupe market is a more fashion-oriented and trend-setting segment . People are willing to pay more money for this type of car . In short , even though the SC1/SC2 may be smaller , hence `` less '' car , it 's market orientation dictates a slightly higher price than its mechanically equivalent sedan ( SL1/SL2 ) version . I hope this clears things up a bit ... ... Mihir Shah

The word harass means to irritate or torment persistently ; I 'd hardly consider one time to fall under the definition of persistent . Additionally , there is no basis to assume the behaviour is unwanted , unlike an illegal proposition . > > > Of course , I think the original question of offering money for sex is > > inarguably harrassment , because the activity is illegal , and could be > > presumed to be unwanted by the average citizen . > > I have to take issue with this viewpoint ... given that ( a ) prostitution > is a victimless crime and ( b ) there are literally millions of Americans > who participate in some sort of victimless activities which the state > has defined to be criminal ( e.g. , prostitution , obscenity , gambling , > using certain recreational drugs , having non-mercenary sex with persons > not one 's spouse in certain states , having `` unnatural '' sex with people > regardless of marital status or exchange of money in certain states , > etc . ) , I 'd have to say that the idea that an activity may be presumed to > be unwanted by the average citizen merely because it is illegal is the > sort of sophistry that only a judge could indulge in with a straight > face . ( He said , speaking as a law student who 's read his share of > judicial opinions in which reality was not only denied but , in fact , > actually inverted in order to make the universe conform to the writer's > politics . ) I was speaking from a legalistic viewpoint . What you say is true , but the law , in order to make what little sense it manages to make , has to make *some* assumptions . Assuming that an illegal activity is unwanted by the average citizen I think is reasonable . Certainly , I would need a preponderance of evidence on the side of the propositioner that there was a reasonable belief that the proposition was welcome . The number of people who participate in `` victimless '' crimes notwithstanding , the fact reamins that under the law , the activity is illegal . To presume that the proposition *is* welcome simply because a large number of people indulge in it is the type of sophistry only a lawyer could indulge in with a straight face . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- ...

If not , how fancy does the compression need to be ? : As far as I know ISDN ( call it Swissnet here , and it 's being plugged in ) it's : 8 bit 8000Hz ( gives you one channel of 64kBit/sec ) I guess you should not go : below a sampling rate of 6000 Hz if you want to have same quality as on an : analog-line . Anybody knows compression-algorithms & -factors for voice ? I 've posted some info on CELP coding on sci.crypt . Looks like you can squeeze speech into 4000bps if you have a fast enough computer like a sparcstation ( or a Newton with the Acorn Risc Machine in it : - ) ) This drops the bandwidth to so low a figure that it 's feasible to run speech over tcp/ip running on top of slip down a v32bis modem . Not only will this let us run point to point encrypted speech , it 'll let us run speech internationally over the internet if no-one stops us by getting *very* heavy about regulations . The thought of this , if the administration realised , would probably scare them shitless . Now of course the trick is to develop and define a standard protocol for internet speech *damn fast* , allowing anyone who feels brave to inplement custom handheld hardware as well as us hacking it on our workstations . Should n't be too difficult . The CELP stuff is standardised , we use tcp/ip streams , and a protocol allowing silences to be used to catch up on any net lag , and also to avoid sending any data during silences ( ie it 's not wise to be synchronised real-time on each end because any net delays would add up to big voice-lags ) As for me , I 'm going to press ahead on trying this stuff as soon as I get my sparc back from being loaned out and buy the necessary microphone . It 'll save me a fortune in calling my friend in texas every night : ) ( whether encrypted or not ) You know , surely *someone* is working on this . Who ? It 's so obvious , why does n't it exist already ? I 've only seen netphone for Suns and it did n't do the CELP compression so was restricted to ether connections . G

From : eder @ hsvaic.boeing.com ( Dani Eder ) Subject : Re : Elevator to the top floor Organization : Boeing AI Center , Huntsville , AL Lines : 56 Reading from a Amoco Performance Products data sheet , their ERL-1906 resin with T40 carbon fiber reinforcement has a compressive strength of 280,000 psi . It has a density of 0.058 lb/cu in , therefore the theoretical height for a constant section column that can just support itself is 4.8 million inches , or 400,000 ft , or 75 Statute miles . Now , a real structure will have horizontal bracing ( either a truss type , or guy wires , or both ) and will be used below the crush strength . Let us assume that we will operate at 40 % of the theoretical strength . This gives a working height of 30 miles for a constant section column . A constant section column is not the limit on how high you can build something if you allow a tapering of the cross section as you go up . For example , let us say you have a 280,000 pound load to support at the top of the tower ( for simplicity in calculation ) . This requires 2.5 square inches of column cross sectional area to support the weight . The mile of structure below the payload will itself weigh 9,200 lb , so at 1 mile below the payload , the total load is now 289,200 lb , a 3.3 % increase . The next mile of structure must be 3.3 % thicker in cross section to support the top mile of tower plus the payload . Each mile of structure must increase in area by the same ratio all the way to the bottom . We can see from this that there is no theoretical limit on area , although there will be practical limits based on how much composites we can afford to by at $ 40/lb , and how much load you need to support on the ground ( for which you need a foundation that the bedrock can support . Let us arbitrarily choose $ 1 billion as the limit in costruction cost . With this we can afford perhaps 10,000,000 lb of composites , assuming our finished structure costs $ 100/lb . The $ 40/lb figure is just for materials cost . Then we have a tower/payload mass ratio of 35.7:1 . At a 3.3 % mass ratio per mile , the tower height becomes 111 miles . This is clearly above the significant atmosphere . A rocket launched from the top of the tower will still have to provide orbital velocity , but atmospheric drag and g-losses will be almost eliminated . G-losses are the component of rocket thrust in the vertical direction to counter gravity , but which do not contribute to horizontal orbital velocity . Thus they represent wasted thrust . Together with drag , rockets starting from the ground have a 15 % velocity penalty to contend with . This analysis is simplified , in that it does not consider wind loads . These will require more structural support over the first 15 miles of height . Above that , the air pressure drops to a low enough value for it not to be a big factor .

These are n't , in a strict sense , amateur rockets . That term denotes rockets , the engines of which are constructed by the user . The rockets you describe are called HPR , or high power rockets , to distinguish them from ( smaller ) model rockets . They use factory-made ammonium perchlorate composite propellants in phenolic plastic engines with graphite nozzles . The engines are classified by impulse . A `` D '' engine , for example , can have no more than 20 newton-seconds of impulse . An `` F '' engine can have no more than 40 ns . Each letter corresponds to a doubling of the maximum impulse . So far , engines up to size `` O '' are available pretty much off the shelf . Engines of size H and above are shipped as Class B explosives , and as such are controlled . Engines of size F and below are shipped as Class C explosives , and are not as controlled . Class F engines , BTW , are not HPR engines , but model rocket engines . ( Class G engines go in and out of legal limbo . ) There is an HPR Society , The Tripoli Rocket Society , I believe , which holds events at various sites throughout the year , with all legalities ( FAA waiver included ) taken care of . The National Association of Rocketry is more concerned with engines below H , though it is involved in HPR as well . These societies certify users of HPR rockets , and companies will not sell to uncertified individuals . Bottom Line : It 's legit .

Let 's make things clear : My opposition to H.R . violations in Arab States is total and without qualification . No Arab State is and can claim to be democratic . No Arab state claims to be democratic . I am born in Palestine ( now Israel ) . I have family there . The lack of peace and utter injustice in my home country has affected me all my life . I am concerned by Palestine ( Israel ) because I want peace to come to it . Peace AND justice . If anybody has legitimate claims towards Arab states , he should present his claims and ask for support . Jews who left Arab states are fully entitled to make claims and should do so , if they consider their case has a merit . It is their basic right to return to these countries , if they wish . If not , they should not complain and compare themselves to the Palestinians who have been struggling for the right of return since Israel was established and whose right is upheld by the United Nations quasi totally . If Jews feel discriminated in Arab countries , they have a legitimate claim that any decent person can and should support . Human rights violations by Arab States do n't justify , legitimate nor are the cause for Israeli breaches of international law and human rioghts . Israeli breaches stem from the Zionist concept , which can only be implemented by negating basic rights to Palestinians . Israeli trights and Palestinian rights are not symmetrical . The first party has a state and the other has none . The first is an occupier and the second the occupied . For any meaningful relationship to emerge , some symmetry must be established . As long as Israelis and Jews do n't realise the necessity of a change of perspective towards the Palestinian people and as long as Israelis and Jews do n't want to exorcise their own past towards the Palestinians ( the Naqba of 1948 , etc . ) and refuse to acknowledge that the creation of Israel was dependent upon the removal of most Palestinian Arabs , there will be no base for a real trust . When I read the first time the list of the 383 Arab villages destroyed by the State of Israel in and after 1948 , I got a shock . I hope others will be touched by this discovery and think about the meaning of such massive destruction and destitution . Elias Davidsson Iceland

Look in : mit/doc/extensions/mit-shm.ms I found this invaluble . Unfortunately , there is a bit of work to set up the shared memory segments , making an XImage from it , etc . Also , there is an extension query to determine if the server supports it , but you still need to test if the server is running on the same host and if shared memory is enabled in the kernel .

Summary : HP compataible Keywords : Plotter HP Epson Organization : Dis- Distribution : usa Lines : 30 Greetings , I have an Epson HI-80 4 pen plotter forsale . It emulates an HP 7570 or 7574 - I 'm not sure which . It has an option board on it that does the emulation . It has a serial interface with Hardware handshake . I also have 340 Pens for it as follows : 10 packs of 4 Black Oil based , 16 packs of 4 Red , Green , Blue , and Black pens , 22 packs of 4 Aqueous Black , 7 packs of 4 Aqueous R , G , Blue , Black , 1 pack of 6 Aqueous Multi color pens , and 114 assorted non-packaged pens mostly colored . The plotter is used . I have tested it using the Windows drivers for HP 7570 and HP 7574 and both worked fine . It accepts either A or B sized paper . ( 8.5 x 11 or 11x17 ) . I figure that the plotter is worth about $ 300 and the pens are worth at least another $ 200 more.. One thing is certain , you wo n't need to purchase any pens for quite a while ... All of the packaged pens were sealed so they are all still fresh . The rest were capped and seem to function as well . I 'd be willing to sell the pens seperate if anyone is interested in just them . I 'm selling it because I got a HP LaserJet and I do n't need color . I 'd like $ 350 or best offer ... -Chert -- Chert Pellett - chert @ dungeon.cirr.com || chert @ dungeon.lonestar.org PANIC : The cat is nibbling on the power cord !

Her neurologist diagnosed her as having depression and suffering from rebound headaches due to daily doses of analgesics . She stopped taking all analgesics and caffine as of last Thursday ( 4/15 ) . The weekend was pretty bad , but she made it through with the help of Imitrex about every 18 hours . Her third injection of Imitrex , during the worst of the withdrawl on Friday and six hours after the first of the day , left her very sick . Skin was flushed , sweating , vomiting and had severe headache pain . It subsided in an hour or so . Since then , she has been taking Imitrex as needed to control the pain . Immediately after taking it , she has increased head pain for ten minutes , dizziness and mild nausea and mild chest pains . A friend of hers mentioned that her doctor was wary of Imitrex because it had caused heart attacks in several people . Apparently the mild chest pains were common in these other people prior to there attacks . Is this just rumor ? Has anyone else heard of these symptoms ?

As I will be moving there this summer , I called Apple to make sure and they told me ( today ) that the IWII ( as bought in the U.S. ) will definitely run on 50 Hz AC current ( as long as a step-down converter is employed if 240 V current is used ) .

Yes , it is true that he refused to buy a franchise from the NHL for $ 50M ; but at the time the reason was that the established market for teams was much less than that . He felt that no one would pay $ 50M for an expansion team , and that he would simply wait to buy an existing franchise for less than that . But the market fooled him , and 5 teams have been created for $ 50M apiece in the last three years , and even the existing teams ca n't be moved for less than $ 50M and I doubt that he could get one for that little . Pettit gambled and lost . Now he 'll have to pay more . -SG

Is this method likely to give better results than server- | resident pixmaps ? I 'd also be interested in looking at the XView code | mentioned above ... There is no easy answer to this question : it depends on whether the display device can hold pixmaps in off-screen memory , and if so , how efficiently the server manages these resources ( having to deal with limited off-screen memory is the bane of the server implementor 's existence ! ) . I have worked with graphics devices where the off-screen memory to main display copy rate eclipses that of the main memory to display copy rate , and with those where the main memory to display is *faster* than off-screen to display ( requires only a write to the framebuffer rather than a read of the F.B . followed by a write ) If your server uses the cfb code or something like it to render into pixmaps in CPU main memory , the rates you can get through MIT-SHM are likely to be equal ( maybe a tad slower , depending on your OS 's implementation of shared memory ) to CopyArea from pixmap to window , which is also then just a copy from CPU main memory to graphics device . One advanage of MIT-SHM is that if your images are large , you do n't end up growing the size of the server process to hold them . One disadvantage of the MIT-SHM is that , in its sample implementation , there is no provision for elegantly cleaning up the shared memory segments if the client dies a sudden , violent death ( e.g. , `` kill '' ) . You have to be mindful of cluttering up the system with zombie shared memory segments . Ken -- Kenneth Whaley ( 408 ) 748-6347 Kubota Pacific Computer , Inc.

Whilst I have tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues , you should always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint . I would encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions ; some relevant books are listed in a companion article . To provide a sense of cohesion and progression , I have presented this article as an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist . All the questions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been cropped up repeatedly on alt.atheism since the newsgroup was created . Some other frequently asked questions are answered in a companion article . Please note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questions posed from a Christian viewpoint . This is because the FAQ files reflect questions which have actually been asked , and it is predominantly Christians who proselytize on alt.atheism . So when I talk of religion , I am talking primarily about religions such as Christianity , Judaism and Islam , which involve some sort of superhuman divine being . Much of the discussion will apply to other religions , but some of it may not . `` What is atheism ? '' Atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God . Some atheists go further , and believe that God does not exist . The former is often referred to as the `` weak atheist '' position , and the latter as `` strong atheism '' . It is important to note the difference between these two positions . `` Weak atheism '' is simple scepticism ; disbelief in the existence of God . `` Strong atheism '' is a positive belief that God does not exist . Please do not fall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are `` strong atheists '' . Some atheists believe in the non-existence of all Gods ; others limit their atheism to specific Gods , such as the Christian God , rather than making flat-out denials . `` But is n't disbelieving in God the same thing as believing he does n't exist ? '' Definitely not . Disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believe it to be true . Not believing that something is true is not equivalent to believing that it is false ; one may simply have no idea whether it is true or not . Which brings us to agnosticism . `` What is agnosticism then ? '' The term 'agnosticism ' was coined by Professor Huxley at a meeting of the Metaphysical Society in 1876 . He defined an agnostic as someone who disclaimed ( `` strong '' ) atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of things must be some cause unknown and unknowable . Thus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and can not know for sure whether God exists . Words are slippery things , and language is inexact . Beware of assuming that you can work out someone 's philosophical point of view simply from the fact that she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic . For example , many people use agnosticism to mean `` weak atheism '' , and use the word `` atheism '' only when referring to `` strong atheism '' . Beware also that because the word `` atheist '' has so many shades of meaning , it is very difficult to generalize about atheists . About all you can say for sure is that atheists do n't believe in God . For example , it certainly isn't the case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find out about the universe . `` So what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheism ? '' There are many philosophical justifications for atheism . To find out why a particular person chooses to be an atheist , it 's best to ask her . Many atheists feel that the idea of God as presented by the major religions is essentially self-contradictory , and that it is logically impossible that such a God could exist . Others are atheists through scepticism , because they see no evidence that God exists . `` But is n't it impossible to prove the non-existence of something ? '' There are many counter-examples to such a statement . For example , it is quite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger than all other prime numbers . Of course , this deals with well-defined objects obeying well-defined rules . Whether Gods or universes are similarly well-defined is a matter for debate . However , assuming for the moment that the existence of a God is not provably impossible , there are still subtle reasons for assuming the non-existence of God . If we assume that something does not exist , it is always possible to show that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counter-example . If on the other hand we assume that something does exist , and if the thing in question is not provably impossible , showing that the assumption is invalid may require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thing might be found , to show that it is n't there . Such an exhaustive search is often impractical or impossible . There is no such problem with largest primes , because we can prove that they do n't exist . Therefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not exist unless we have evidence that they do . Even theists follow this rule most of the time ; they do n't believe in unicorns , even though they ca n't conclusively prove that no unicorns exist anywhere . To assume that God exists is to make an assumption which probably can not be tested . We can not make an exhaustive search of everywhere God might be to prove that he does n't exist anywhere . So the sceptical atheist assumes by default that God does not exist , since that is an assumption we can test . Those who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of God exists ; instead , they generally restrict their claims so as to cover varieties of God described by followers of various religions . So whilst it may be impossible to prove conclusively that no God exists , it may be possible to prove that ( say ) a God as described by a particular religious book does not exist . It may even be possible to prove that no God described by any present-day religion exists . In practice , believing that no God described by any religion exists is very close to believing that no God exists . However , it is sufficiently different that counter-arguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind of God are not really applicable . `` But what if God is essentially non-detectable ? '' If God interacts with our universe in any way , the effects of his interaction must be measurable . Hence his interaction with our universe must be detectable . If God is essentially non-detectable , it must therefore be the case that he does not interact with our universe in any way . Many atheists would argue that if God does not interact with our universe at all , it is of no importance whether he exists or not . If the Bible is to be believed , God was easily detectable by the Israelites . Surely he should still be detectable today ? Note that I am not demanding that God interact in a scientifically verifiable , physical way . It must surely be possible to perceive some effect caused by his presence , though ; otherwise , how can I distinguish him from all the other things that do n't exist ? `` OK , you may think there 's a philosophical justification for atheism , but is n't it still a religious belief ? '' One of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is `` the redefinition game '' . The cynical view of this game is as follows : Person A begins by making a contentious statement . When person B points out that it ca n't be true , person A gradually re-defines the words he used in the statement until he arrives at something person B is prepared to accept . He then records the statement , along with the fact that person B has agreed to it , and continues . Eventually A uses the statement as an `` agreed fact '' , but uses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscure redefinitions originally needed to get B to agree to it . Rather than be seen to be apparently inconsistent , B will tend to play along . The point of this digression is that the answer to the question `` Isn't atheism a religious belief ? '' depends crucially upon what is meant by '' religious '' . `` Religion '' is generally characterized by belief in a superhuman controlling power -- especially in some sort of God -- and by faith and worship . [ It 's worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of Buddhism are not `` religion '' according to such a definition . ] Atheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power , nor is it categorized by worship in any meaningful sense . Widening the definition of '' religious '' to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects of human behaviour suddenly becoming classed as `` religious '' as well -- such as science , politics , and watching TV . `` OK , so it 's not a religion . But surely belief in atheism ( or science ) is still just an act of faith , like religion is ? '' Firstly , it 's not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something one actually believes in . Secondly , it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions to make some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience . Most atheists try to adopt as few core beliefs as possible ; and even those are subject to questioning if experience throws them into doubt . Science has a number of core assumptions . For example , it is generally assumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers . These are the sort of core assumptions atheists make . If such basic ideas are called '' acts of faith '' , then almost everything we know must be said to be based on acts of faith , and the term loses its meaning . Faith is more often used to refer to complete , certain belief in something . According to such a definition , atheism and science are certainly not acts of faith . Of course , individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic as religious followers when claiming that something is `` certain '' . This is not a general tendency , however ; there are many atheists who would be reluctant to state with certainty that the universe exists . Faith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proof . Sceptical atheism certainly does n't fit that definition , as sceptical atheism has no beliefs . Strong atheism is closer , but still does n't really match , as even the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data ( or the lack of it ) when asserting that God does not exist . `` If atheism is not religious , surely it 's anti-religious ? '' It is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either `` for '' or '' against '' , `` friend '' or `` enemy '' . The truth is not so clear-cut . Atheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism ; in that sense , it can be said to be `` anti-religion '' . However , when religious believers speak of atheists being `` anti-religious '' they usually mean that the atheists have some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theists . This categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfair . Atheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrum . Most atheists take a `` live and let live '' attitude . Unless questioned , they will not usually mention their atheism , except perhaps to close friends . Of course , this may be in part because atheism is not `` socially acceptable '' in many countries . A few atheists are quite anti-religious , and may even try to `` convert '' others when possible . Historically , such anti-religious atheists have made little impact on society outside the Eastern Bloc countries . ( To digress slightly : the Soviet Union was originally dedicated to separation of church and state , just like the USA . Soviet citizens were legally free to worship as they wished . The institution of `` state atheism '' came about when Stalin took control of the Soviet Union and tried to destroy the churches in order to gain complete power over the population . ) Some atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs , but only where they see religion encroaching on matters which are not its business -- for example , the government of the USA . Such individuals are usually concerned that church and state should remain separate . `` But if you do n't allow religion to have a say in the running of the state , surely that 's the same as state atheism ? '' The principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shall not legislate concerning matters of religious belief . In particular , it means not only that the state can not promote one religion at the expense of another , but also that it can not promote any belief which is religious in nature . Religions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters . For example , religious believers have historically been responsible for encouraging many political reforms . Even today , many organizations campaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded as religious campaigns . So long as they campaign concerning secular matters , and so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds , most atheists are quite happy to see them have their say . `` What about prayer in schools ? If there 's no God , why do you care if people pray ? '' Because people who do pray are voters and lawmakers , and tend to do things that those who do n't pray ca n't just ignore . Also , Christian prayer in schools is intimidating to non-Christians , even if they are told that they need not join in . The diversity of religious and non-religious belief means that it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will be acceptable to all those present at any public event . Also , non-prayers tend to have friends and family who pray . It is reasonable to care about friends and family wasting their time , even without other motives . `` You mentioned Christians who campaign for increased foreign aid . What about atheists ? Why are n't there any atheist charities or hospitals ? Don't atheists object to the religious charities ? '' There are many charities without religious purpose that atheists can contribute to . Some atheists contribute to religious charities as well , for the sake of the practical good they do . Some atheists even do voluntary work for charities founded on a theistic basis . Most atheists seem to feel that atheism is n't worth shouting about in connection with charity . To them , atheism is just a simple , obvious everyday matter , and so is charity . Many feel that it 's somewhat cheap , not to say self-righteous , to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular set of religious beliefs . To `` weak '' atheists , building a hospital to say `` I do not believe in God '' is a rather strange idea ; it 's rather like holding a party to say `` Today is not my birthday '' . Why the fuss ? Atheism is rarely evangelical . `` You said atheism is n't anti-religious . But is it perhaps a backlash against one 's upbringing , a way of rebelling ? '' Perhaps it is , for some . But many people have parents who do not attempt to force any religious ( or atheist ) ideas upon them , and many of those people choose to call themselves atheists . It 's also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as a backlash against an atheist upbringing , as a way of being different . On the other hand , many people choose religion as a way of conforming to the expectations of others . On the whole , we ca n't conclude much about whether atheism or religion are backlash or conformism ; although in general , people have a tendency to go along with a group rather than act or think independently . `` How do atheists differ from religious people ? '' They do n't believe in God . That 's all there is to it . Atheists may listen to heavy metal -- backwards , even -- or they may prefer a Verdi Requiem , even if they know the words . They may wear Hawaiian shirts , they may dress all in black , they may even wear orange robes . ( Many Buddhists lack a belief in any sort of God . ) Some atheists even carry a copy of the Bible around -- for arguing against , of course ! Whoever you are , the chances are you have met several atheists without realising it . Atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour and appearance . `` Unexceptional ? But are n't atheists less moral than religious people ? '' That depends . If you define morality as obedience to God , then of course atheists are less moral as they do n't obey any God . But usually when one talks of morality , one talks of what is acceptable ( `` right '' ) and unacceptable ( `` wrong '' ) behaviour within society . Humans are social animals , and to be maximally successful they must co-operate with each other . This is a good enough reason to discourage most atheists from `` anti-social '' or `` immoral '' behaviour , purely for the purposes of self-preservation . Many atheists behave in a `` moral '' or `` compassionate '' way simply because they feel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans . So why do they care what happens to others ? They do n't know , they simply are that way . Naturally , there are some people who behave `` immorally '' and try to use atheism to justify their actions . However , there are equally many people who behave `` immorally '' and then try to use religious beliefs to justify their actions . For example : `` Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance : Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners ... But for that very reason , I was shown mercy so that in me ... Jesus Christ might display His unlimited patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive eternal life . Now to the king eternal , immortal , invisible , the only God , be honor and glory forever and ever . '' The above quote is from a statement made to the court on February 17th 1992 by Jeffrey Dahmer , the notorious cannibal serial killer of Milwaukee , Wisconsin . It seems that for every atheist mass-murderer , there is a religious mass-murderer . But what of more trivial morality ? A survey conducted by the Roper Organization found that behavior deteriorated after `` born again '' experiences . While only 4 % of respondents said they had driven intoxicated before being `` born again , '' 12 % had done so after conversion . Similarly , 5 % had used illegal drugs before conversion , 9 % after . Two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex before salvation ; 5 % after . [ `` Freethought Today '' , September 1991 , p . 12 . ] So it seems that at best , religion does not have a monopoly on moral behaviour . `` Is there such a thing as atheist morality ? '' If you mean `` Is there such a thing as morality for atheists ? `` , then the answer is yes , as explained above . Many atheists have ideas about morality which are at least as strong as those held by religious people . If you mean `` Does atheism have a characteristic moral code ? `` , then the answer is no . Atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a person will behave . Most atheists follow many of the same `` moral rules '' as theists , but for different reasons . Atheists view morality as something created by humans , according to the way humans feel the world 'ought ' to work , rather than seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural being . `` Then are n't atheists just theists who are denying God ? '' A study by the Freedom From Religion Foundation found that over 90 % of the atheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work for them . They had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatible with what they observed around them . Atheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial ; they are unbelievers through choice . The vast majority of them have spent time studying one or more religions , sometimes in very great depth . They have made a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefs . This decision may , of course , be an inevitable consequence of that individual 's personality . For a naturally sceptical person , the choice of atheism is often the only one that makes sense , and hence the only choice that person can honestly make . `` But do n't atheists want to believe in God ? '' Atheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them . Many of them have no desire to be watched over , no matter how good-natured the '' Big Brother '' figure might be . Some atheists would like to be able to believe in God -- but so what ? Should one believe things merely because one wants them to be true ? The risks of such an approach should be obvious . Atheists often decide that wanting to believe something is not enough ; there must be evidence for the belief . `` But of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of God -- they are unwilling in their souls to see ! '' Many , if not most atheists were previously religious . As has been explained above , the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that God exists . Many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach God . Of course , it is true that some atheists lack an open mind ; but assuming that all atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closed-minded . Comments such as `` Of course God is there , you just are n't looking properly '' are likely to be viewed as patronizing . Certainly , if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it is vital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they are being sincere if they say that they have searched for God . If you are not willing to believe that they are basically telling the truth , debate is futile . `` Is n't the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist ? '' Many atheists live a purposeful life . They decide what they think gives meaning to life , and they pursue those goals . They try to make their lives count , not by wishing for eternal life , but by having an influence on other people who will live on . For example , an atheist may dedicate his life to political reform , in the hope of leaving his mark on history . It is a natural human tendency to look for `` meaning '' or `` purpose '' in random events . However , it is by no means obvious that `` life '' is the sort of thing that has a `` meaning '' . To put it another way , not everything which looks like a question is actually a sensible thing to ask . Some atheists believe that asking `` What is the meaning of life ? '' is as silly as asking `` What is the meaning of a cup of coffee ? '' . They believe that life has no purpose or meaning , it just is . `` So how do atheists find comfort in time of danger ? '' There are many ways of obtaining comfort ; from family , friends , or even pets . Or on a less spiritual level , from food or drink or TV . That may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger , but so what ? Should individuals believe in things because they are comforting , or should they face reality no matter how harsh it might be ? In the end , it 's a decision for the individual concerned . Most atheists are unable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely because it makes them feel comfortable . They put truth before comfort , and consider that if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy , that 's just hard luck . `` Do n't atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrong ? '' The short answer is `` No , do you ? '' Many atheists have been atheists for years . They have encountered many arguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of God , but they have found all of it to be invalid or inconclusive . Thousands of years of religious belief have n't resulted in any good proof of the existence of God . Atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikely to be proved wrong in the immediate future , and they stop worrying about it . `` So why should theists question their beliefs ? Do n't the same arguments apply ? '' No , because the beliefs being questioned are not similar . Weak atheism is the sceptical `` default position '' to take ; it asserts nothing . Strong atheism is a negative belief . Theism is a very strong positive belief . Atheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefs because of the very real harm they can cause -- not just to the believers , but to everyone else . `` What sort of harm ? '' Religion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind . It 's not just a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildings ; think of all the time and effort spent building churches , praying , and so on . Imagine how that effort could be better spent . Many theists believe in miracle healing . There have been plenty of instances of ill people being `` healed '' by a priest , ceasing to take the medicines prescribed to them by doctors , and dying as a result . Some theists have died because they have refused blood transfusions on religious grounds . It is arguable that the Catholic Church 's opposition to birth control -- and condoms in particular -- is increasing the problem of overpopulation in many third-world countries and contributing to the spread of AIDS world-wide . Religious believers have been known to murder their children rather than allow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a different religion . `` Those were n't REAL believers . They just claimed to be believers as some sort of excuse . '' What makes a real believer ? There are so many One True Religions it 's hard to tell . Look at Christianity : there are many competing groups , all convinced that they are the only true Christians . Sometimes they even fight and kill each other . How is an atheist supposed to decide who 's a REAL Christian and who is n't , when even the major Christian churches like the Catholic Church and the Church of England ca n't decide amongst themselves ? In the end , most atheists take a pragmatic view , and decide that anyone who calls himself a Christian , and uses Christian belief or dogma to justify his actions , should be considered a Christian . Maybe some of those Christians are just perverting Christian teaching for their own ends -- but surely if the Bible can be so readily used to support un-Christian acts it ca n't be much of a moral code ? If the Bible is the word of God , why could n't he have made it less easy to misinterpret ? And how do you know that your beliefs are n't a perversion of what your God intended ? If there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the Bible , then why should an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your say-so ? Sorry , but if someone claims that he believes in Jesus and that he murdered others because Jesus and the Bible told him to do so , we must call him a Christian . `` Obviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned . But since nobody has ever proved that God does not exist , it must be very unlikely that more basic religious beliefs , shared by all faiths , are nonsense . '' That does not hold , because as was pointed out at the start of this dialogue , positive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently much harder to disprove than negative ones . Nobody has ever proved that unicorns do n't exist , but that does n't make it unlikely that they are myths . It is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default than it is to hold a positive assertion by default . Of course , `` weak '' atheists would argue that asserting nothing is better still . `` Well , if atheism 's so great , why are there so many theists ? '' Unfortunately , the popularity of a belief has little to do with how `` correct '' it is , or whether it `` works '' ; consider how many people believe in astrology , graphology , and other pseudo-sciences . Many atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe in gods . Certainly in many primitive human societies , religion allows the people to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understand . Of course , there 's more to religion than that . In the industrialized world , we find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even when there are perfectly adequate natural explanations . Religion may have started as a means of attempting to explain the world , but nowadays it serves other purposes as well . `` But so many cultures have developed religions . Surely that must say something ? '' Not really . Most religions are only superficially similar ; for example , it's worth remembering that religions such as Buddhism and Taoism lack any sort of concept of God in the Christian sense . Of course , most religions are quick to denounce competing religions , so it's rather odd to use one religion to try and justify another . `` What about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded that God exists ? '' For every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god , there is one who does not . Besides , as has already been pointed out , the truth of a belief is not determined by how many people believe it . Also , it is important to realize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in the same way that theists view their religious leaders . A famous scientist is only human ; she may be an expert in some fields , but when she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight . Many respected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking on subjects which lie outside their fields of expertise . `` So are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates nothing ? '' Not entirely . It certainly indicates that the religion in question has properties which have helped it so spread so far . The theory of memetics talks of `` memes '' -- sets of ideas which can propagate themselves between human minds , by analogy with genes . Some atheists view religions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes , which spread by encouraging their hosts to convert others . Some memes avoid destruction by discouraging believers from questioning doctrine , or by using peer pressure to keep one-time believers from admitting that they were mistaken . Some religious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled by other memes . Of course , in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated with successful propagation of a meme . Religion is not a good thing because of the number of people who believe it , any more than a disease is a good thing because of the number of people who have caught it . `` Even if religion is not entirely true , at least it puts across important messages . What are the fundamental messages of atheism ? '' There are many important ideas atheists promote . The following are just a few of them ; do n't be surprised to see ideas which are also present in some religions . There is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules . Be especially sceptical of positive claims . If you want your life to have some sort of meaning , it 's up to you to find it . Search for what is true , even if it makes you uncomfortable . Make the most of your life , as it 's probably the only one you 'll have . It 's no good relying on some external power to change you ; you must change yourself . Just because something 's popular does n't mean it 's good . If you must assume something , assume something it 's easy to test . Do n't believe things just because you want them to be true . and finally ( and most importantly ) : All beliefs should be open to question .

I attended a colloquium at Goddard last fall where the head of the operations section of NASA was talking about what future missions were going to be funded . I do n't remember his name or title off hand and I have discarded the colloquia announcement . In any case , he was asked about that very matter : `` Why ca n't we spend a few million more to keep instruments that we already have in place going ? '' His responce was that there are only so many $ available to him and the lead time on an instrument like a COBE , Magellan , Hubble , etc is 5-10 years minumum . If he spent all that could be spent on using current instruments in the current budget enviroment he would have very little to nothing for future projects . If he did that , sure in the short run the science would be wonderful and he would be popular , however starting a few years after he had retired he would become one of the greatest villans ever seen in the space community for not funding the early stages of the next generation of instruments . Just as he had benefited from his predicessor 's funding choices , he owed it to whoever his sucessor would eventually be to keep developing new missions , even at the expense of cutting off some instruments before the last drop of possible science has been wrung out of them . -- Covert C Beach dragon @ access.digex.com

It is good to remember that every translation is to some extent an interpretation , so ( as you point out below ) one must really go back to the original Arabic . Regarding the verses relevant to nature , I prefer to use Dr. Maurice Bucaille 's translations ( in his book , `` The Bible , the Qur'an and Science '' ) for in general his translations are more literal . Maurice Bucaille translates the portion of the verse you are addressing as '' ... Each one is travelling with an orbit in its own motion . '' ( Also note that `` the celestial bodies '' in the first translation quoted by you above is the translator 's interpolation -- it is not existent in the original Arabic , which is why it is included in brackets . ) > Perhaps someone who can read the original Arabic can eliminate one of > these interpretations ; at any rate , neither one of them is exactly > impressive . You 're right , what the verses _do_ contain is n't all that remarkable . However , Dr. Bucaille ( a surgeon , that 's how he 's a `` Dr. '' ) thinks it is significant that the above verse contains no geocentric ideas , even though geocentrism was all the rage up until the 17th century ( ? ) or so .

From : kilroy @ gboro.rowan.edu ( Dr Nancy 's Sweetie ) Subject : Re : Certainty and Arrogance Organization : Rowan College of New Jersey Lines : 122 In an earlier article , I explained that what many people find arrogant about Christians is that some Christians profess absolute certianty about their beliefs and doctrines . That is , many Christians insist that they CAN NOT have made any mistakes when discovering their beliefs , which amounts to saying that they are infallible . Impicitly claiming to be infallible is pretty arrogant , most of us will probably agree . In short , the problem is that no matter how good your sources are , if any part of your doctrines or beliefs rest on your own thinking and reasoning , then those doctrines are suspect . So long as your own brain is involved , there is a possibility for error . I summarised the problem by writing `` There is no way out of the loop . '' Someone called ` REXLEX ' has claimed that there IS a way out of the loop , but he did not bother to explain what it was , preferring instead to paraphrase Sartre , ramble about Wittgenstein , and say that the conclusion of my argument leads to relativism . As I have explained to him before , you can not reject an argument as false because you dislike where it leads : the facts do not change just because you dislike them . ` REXLEX ' wrote : > I disagree with Dr Nancy 's Sweetie 's conclusion because if it is > taken to fruition it leads to relativism which leads to dispair . However , as any first-year philosophy student can explain , what ` REXLEX ' has written does not constitute a refutation . All he has said is that he does not like what I wrote -- he has done nothing at all to dispute it . * There were two sentences in ` REXLEX 's post that seemed relevant to the point at hand : > There is such a thing as true truth and it is real , it can be > experienced and it is verifiable . I do not dispute that some truths can be verified through experience . I have , for example , direct experience of adding numbers . I do n't claim to be infallible at it -- in fact I remember doing sums incorrectly -- but I do claim that I have direct experience of reasoning about numbers . However , once we go past experiencing things and start reasoning about them , we are on much shakier ground . That was the point of the earlier article . Human brains are infested with sin , and they can only be trusted in very limited circumstances . > It is only because of God 's own revelation that we can be absolute > about a thing . But how far does that get you ? Once God 's revelation stops , and your own reasoning begins , possibility for error appears . For example , let 's suppose that our modern Bible translations include a perfect rendering of Jesus words at the Last Supper , and that Jesus said , exactly , `` This is my body . '' We 'll presume that what he said was totally without error and absolutely true . What can we be certain of ? Not much . At the moment he stops speaking , and people start interpreting , the possibility of error appears . Did he mean that literally or not ? We do not have any record that he elaborated on the words . Was he thinking of Tran- or Con- substatiation ? He did n't say . We interpret this passage using our brains ; we think and reason and draw conclusions . But we know that our brains are not perfect : our thinking often leads us wrong . ( This is something that most of us have direct experience of . 8- ) Why should anyone believe that his reasoning -- which he knows to be fallible -- can lead him to perfect conclusions ? So , given the assumptions in this example , what we can be certain of is that Jesus said `` This is my body . '' Beyond that , once we start making up doctrines and using our brains to reason about what Christ revealed , we get into trouble . Unless you are infallible , there are very few things you can be certain of . To the extent that doctrines rely on fallible human thinking , they can not be certain . That is the problem of seeming arrogant . The non-Christians around us know that human beings make mistakes , just as surely as we know it . They do not believe we are infallible , any more than we do . When Christians speak as if they believe their own reasoning can never lead them astray -- when we implicitly claim that we are infallible -- the non- Christians around us rarely believe that implicit claim . Witnessing is hardly going to work when the person you are talking to believes that you are either too foolish to recognise your own limits , or intentionally trying to cover them up . I think it would be far better to say what things we are certain of and what things we are only `` very confident '' of . For example , we might say that we know our sin , for recognising sin is something we directly experience . But other things , whether based on reasoning from Scripture or extra-Biblical thinking , should not be labled as infallible : we should say that we are very confident of them , and be ready to explain our reasoning . But , so far as I am aware , none of us is infallible -- speaking or acting as if our thinking is flawless is ridiculous . * ` REXLEX ' suggested that people read _He is There and He is Not Silent_ , by Francis Schaeffer . I did n't think very highly of it , but I think that Mr Schaeffer is grossly overrated by many Evangelical Christians . Somebody else might like it , though , so do n't let my opinion stop you from reading it . If someone is interested in my opinion , I 'd suggest _On Certainty_ , by Ludwig Wittgenstein .

According to this morning 's Post-Gazette : The Pens will be carried by KDKA-Radio ( 1020 am ) , unless the Pirates are playing . When the Pirates play , the games will be carried by WDVE ( 102.5 fm ) . WDVE will carry 12 games , starting with tonight's game . In fact , after this season , KDKA will no longer be the flagship station for the Pens . The Penguins and KBL have struck a new deal regarding the TV and radio rights to the games . It seems more than likely that WDVE will be the flagship radio station next season . KBL will carry 62 games on tv , with 17 of the games to be simulcast on KDKA-TV . The remaining 22 games , as well as some of the early round playoff games , will be available by `` subscription tv '' only . To receive the games , you 'll have to pay a one time hook up fee , and then a monthly fee of $ 11-12 dollars . Also , under the new deal , there will no longer be radio/tv simulcasts . There will be a TV broadcast team , and a radio broadcast team . No word on who the announcers will be . Mike Lange and Paul Steigerwald are both under contract with KDKA , but their contracts expire at the end of this season . KBL President Bill Craig said he 'd like to hire Lange and Steigerwald .

Reply-To : tclark @ med.unc.edu Organization : UNC School of Medicine Lines : 11 I do n't think there is really any question about which god the courts mean . The request for solemnly swearing , so help you god , is always made after a request to pick up the bible in your left hand and hold up your right hand . In the courts of NC , at least , it is always an old and new testament . Though it is hard to imagine , picking up the bible and swearing to ( whatever ) god is sometimes the least of the religious influence . There is a court in Greensboro , NC , where the judge routinely has everyone in the courtroom stand to join him in prayer at the beginning of every session . I 've thought about sitting through it , but I 'm not terribly anxious to spend 30 days in jail ...

It is certainly possible , and quite easy in most cases , especially on two-strokes . It 's very common to do this on bikes where the cylinder-mounting through-studs do n't prevent the cylinder from being removed with the engine in the frame . I did this when I assembled the top end on my Indian , which was easier yet because it does not have through-studs . Base flange studs , and separate head bolts , dontchaknow . You have to use a little foresight , rags , duct tape , etc . to keep clips from falling in , clothespins , hoseclamps , etc . to support the cylinder while you 're inserting the pins .

If youre really cold the muffler will feel fine till you leave all the charred skin on it when you peel your hands off - I speak from experience . You can also do all kindsa ( Americanism of the day ) damage to your circulation warming hands up on something too hot .

Top three contenders seem to be AT & T Paradyne , ZyXEL , and US Robotics . ZyXEL has the biggest `` cult following '' , and can be had for under $ 300 , but I ignored it because I need something with Mac software , which will work without any tweaking . The AT & T Dataport earns nearly unanimous praises for reliability . They are backordered at the moment , probably because of the special $ 299 price in effect until May . Its fax capabilities are worse than that of the other two modems . WARNING : AT & T ads say that the modem comes with a Mac kit ( cables & all ) , and has lifetime warranty . This applies *only* when you order directly from Paradyne ! I called ElekTek ( one of the distributors ) , and they wanted to charge me $ 16 for cable , and gave only 1 year warranty ... USR Sportster for the Mac is also highly ( but not as highly ) recommended ; it 's only $ 250 from ClubMac , and if you are willing to roll your own cable and do n't care about the FAXstf software , you can get the generic model from PC outlets for $ 190 .

'' - Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed . You > will have both body and soul in hell - eventually . Now this is getting interesting ! I was raised Roman Catholic before becoming an atheist , so I have stated this Creed you quote nearly every Sunday until I was about 18 . For some reason , I always took the 'resurrection ' in this statement to mean the resurrection of the soul , but I guess resurrection does strictly mean the raising of the physical body . I have some questions on this point : 1 . I always thought that Christians believe the descent into hell was pretty much immediate , and that there are people burning in hell right now . You seem to be implying that it will not occur until after the '' great judgement '' ( which I read as meaning the proverbial Judgment Day ) . I was always a little confused on this point , even when I was with the church -- maybe someone can clear it up for me . Where will my `` soul '' ( which , by the way , I do n't believe in ) exist until that time ? 2 . Will the new body I will have be created out of the same atoms that my body now is made of , or will it be built from scratch ? My physical body now is susceptible to aging , etc . -- so I guess my new body will have to be radically different in order to be immortal so it can be tortured for all eternity ? 3 . Since I will have a physical body , I assume it will need a physical place to exist in -- where is this hell ? In the center of the earth ? Do you think we could find it if we dig ? Mark Schnitzius schnitzi @ eola.cs.ucf.edu Univ . of Central Florida [ There is not complete agreement on the details of the afterlife . I think the most common view is that final disposition does not occur until a final judgement , which is still in the future . In the meantime , some believe that people `` sleep '' until the final resurrection ( or because God is above time , pass directly from death to the future time when the resurrection occurs ) , while others believe that souls have a disembodied , pre-resurrection existence until then . There are probably other alternatives that I 'm omitting . The new body is generally conceived of being implemented in a different `` technology '' than the current one , one which is not mortal . ( Paul talks about the mortal being raised to immortality , and Jesus' resurrected body -- which is the first example -- clearly was not subject to the same kind of limitations as ours . ) It is assumed that there are enough similarities that people will recognize each other , but I do n't think most people claim to know the details . I don't think I 'd say it 's the same atoms . I 'd assume there would be some analog of a physical place , but I would n't expect to find it under the earth or up in the sky . I 'd suspect that it 's in another dimension , outside this physical world , or whatever . But again , we have little in the way of details . -- clh ]

From : arens @ ISI.EDU ( Yigal Arens ) Subject : More on ADL spying case Organization : USC/Information Sciences Institute Lines : 222 Distribution : world NNTP-Posting-Host : grl.isi.edu Los Angeles Times , Tuesday , April 13 , 1993 . P. A1 . NEW DETAILS OF EXTENSIVE ADL SPY OPERATION EMERGE * INQUIRY : Transcripts reveal nearly 40 years of espionage by a man who infiltrated political groups By Richard C. Paddock , Times staff writer . SAN FRANCISCO -- To the outside world , Roy Bullock was a small-time art dealer who operated from his house in the Castro District . In reality , he was an undercover spy who picked through garbage and amassed secret files for the Anti-Defamation League for nearly 40 years . His code name at the prominent Jewish organization was Cal , and he was so successful at infiltrating political groups that he was once chosen to head an Arab-American delegation that visited Rep. Nancy Pelosi ( D-San Francisco ) in her Washington , D.C. , office . For a time , Cal tapped into the phone message system of the White Aryan Resistance to learn of hate crimes . From police sources he obtained privileged , personal information on at least 1,394 people . And he met surreptitiously with agents of the South African government to trade his knowledge for crisp , new $ 100 bills . These are among the secrets that Bullock and David Gurvitz , a former Los Angeles-based operative , divulged in extensive interviews with police and the FBI in a growing scandal over the nation-wide intelligence network operated by the Anti-Defamation League . Officials of the Anti-Defamation League , while denying any improper activity , have said they will cooperate with the investigation . They have refused to discuss Bullock and Gurvitz . Transcripts of the interviews -- among nearly 700 pages of documents released by San Francisco prosecutors last week -- offer new details of the private spy operation that authorities allege crossed the line into illegal territory . At times , the intelligence activities took on a cloak-and-dagger air with laundered payments , shredded documents , hotel rendezvous with foreign agents and code names like `` Ironsides '' and `` Flipper . '' On one occasion , Gurvitz recounts , he received a tip that a pro-Palestinian activist was about to board a plane bound for Haifa , Israel . Although the Anti-Defamation League publicly denies any ties to Israel , Gurvitz phoned an Israeli consular official to warn him . Shortly afterward , another official called Gurvitz back and debriefed him . The court papers also added to the mystery of Tom Gerard , a former CIA agent and San Francisco police officer accused of providing confidential material from police files to the Anti-Defamation League . Gerard fled to the Philippines last fall after he was interviewed by the FBI , but left behind a briefcase in his police locker . Its contents included passports , driver 's licenses and identification cards in 10 different names ; identification cards in his own name for four American embassies in Central America ; and a collection of blank birth certificates , Army discharge papers and official stationery from various agencies . Also in the briefcase were extensive information on death squads , a black hood , apparently for use in interrogations , and photos of blindfolded and chained men . Investigators suspect that Gerard and other police sources gave the ADL confidential driver 's license or vehicle registration information on a vast number of people , including as many as 4,500 members of one target group , the Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee . Each case of obtaining such data from a law enforcement officer would constitute a felony , San Francisco Police Inspector Ron Roth noted in an affidavit for a search warrant . The Anti-Defamation League , a self-described Jewish defense and civil rights organization , acknowledges it has long collected information on groups that are anti-Semitic , extremist or racist . The ADL's fact-finding division , headed by Irwinn Suall in New York , enjoys a reputation for thoroughness and has often shared its information with police agencies and journalists . However , evidence seized from Bullock 's computer shows he kept files on at least 950 groups of all political stripes , including the American Civil Liberties Union , Earth Island Institute , the United Farm Workers , Jews for Jesus , Mother Jones magazine , the Center for Investigative Reporting , the Bo Gritz for President Committee , the Asian Law Caucus and the AIDS activist group ACT UP . The computer files also included information on several members of Congress , including Pelosi , House Armed Services Committee Chairman Ron Dellums ( D-Berkeley ) and former Republican Rep. Pete McCloskey from the Bay Area . In their statements , Bullock and Gurvitz said the Anti-Defamation League has collected information on political activists in the Los Angeles area for more than 30 years . They said they worked closely with three Los Angeles County sheriff 's deputies who specialized in intelligence work , a Los Angeles Police Department anti-terrorism expert and a San Diego County Sheriff 's Department intelligence officer . A spokesman for the Los Angeles Sheriff 's Department said he knew nothing of any contact between the deputies and the ADL . The Los Angeles Police Department , which earlier refused to cooperate with the investigation , and the San Diego Sheriff 's Department declined comment . Bullock , 58 , is one of the most intriguing characters in the spy drama . Although he is not Jewish , he began working undercover as a volunteer for the ADL and the FBI in Indiana in 1954 after reading a book about a man who infiltrated the Communist Party . Bullock moved to Los Angeles in 1960 and was given a paid position by the ADL as an intelligence operative , he told authorities . In the mid-1970s , he moved to San Francisco and continued his spy operations up and down the West Coast . To keep his identity secret , his salary has always been funneled through Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I. Hochman -- who has never missed a payment in more than 32 years , Bullock said . `` I was an investigator for the ADL . I investigated any and all anti-democratic movements , '' Bullock said . `` . . . Officially , I 'm only a contract worker with Bruce Hochman . That way , the league would not be officially connected with me . '' Bullock said he became a master at infiltrating groups from Communists to Arab-American to gay radicals to skinheads , usually using his own name but once adopting the alias Elmer Fink . `` I 'm one of a kind , '' he told police . In recent years , however , his ADL affiliation has increasingly become known , and at one point he was confronted by a skinhead armed with a shotgun who threatened to kill him . In the mid-1980s , he helped San Francisco police solve a bombing at a synagogue by combing through the trash of extremist Cory Phelps and matching handwriting with samples on a threatening letter obtained by police . In part because of this investigation , he became close friends with Gerard , who at the time was working in the San Francisco police intelligence division . Bullock frequently searched through the garbage of target groups . An FBI report noted how he investigated one Palestinian group : '' Bullock would write reports based on what he found in the trash , and would share the reports with Gerard . Bullock also gave the trash to Gerard for Gerard to examine . Gerard would later return the trash to Bullock . '' From a wide range of sources , Bullock compiled files on 9,876 individuals and more than 950 political groups . Gerard , whose files contained many identical entries , kept files on 7,011 people . In 1987 , Bullock and Gerard began selling some of their vast wealth of information to the South African government . Bullock tells of meetings secretly with South African agents at San Francisco hotels and receiving envelopes filled with thousands of dollars in new $ 100 bills . Bullock insists the information he sold consisted of data he culled only from public sources . Once he rewrote an innocuous item published by San Francisco Chronicle columnist Herb Caen about South African Bishop Desmond Tutu and the wife of prominent attorney Melvin Belli -- and submitted it as his own work . Bullock said it was Gerard who sold official police intelligence . Bullock said he split about $ 16,000 from the South African government evenly with Gerard , telling him at one point , `` I may be gay but I 'm a straight arrow . '' In his interviews with the police and FBI , Bullock talked freely about engaging in certain activities that prosecutors say would appear to violate the law . For example , Bullock admitted to receiving driver 's license records and criminal histories from Gerard on about 50 people -- a fraction of the confidential police data found in his computer . And he said Gerard gave him complete San Francisco Police Department intelligence files on various Nazi groups that were supposed to be destroyed under department policy . Bullock said he also received a confidential FBI report on the Nation of Islam that he later shredded at the Anti-Defamation League 's San Francisco office . Bullock seemed proud of his `` Operation Eavesdrop , '' in which he used a paid informant , code-named Scumbag , to help tap into a White Aryan Resistance phone message network , listening to the messages left by members of the right-wing group . `` For a short time , it was wonderful , '' he told police . In Los Angeles , ADL operative Gurvitz was hired about four years ago as a `` fact-finder '' to keep intelligence files and occasionally go undercover to the meetings of target groups . Among other things , he told San Francisco authorities , the Los Angeles ADL office kept a record of any Arab-American who had `` anti-Israel leanings '' or who wrote a letter to a newspaper expressing such sentiment . Gurvitz was recently forced to resign after an incident in which he attempted to misuse the ADL intelligence network to seek revenge on a rival who got a job Gurvitz wanted at the Simon Wiesenthal Center for Holocaust Studies . Gurvitz got confidential police data on the rival and threatened to expose him as a Jewish spy to a right-wing hate group . Gurvitz has since begun cooperating with police and the FBI in the probe , providing considerable information about the ADL operation . Unlike Bullock , he has been assured he is not a subject of the investigation . Gurvitz declined through his father in Los Angeles to be interviewed by The Times . Bullock 's attorney said his client would not comment . -- Yigal Arens USC/ISI TV made me do it ! arens @ isi.edu

Organization : Purdue University Engineering Computer Network Lines : 12 I have stated before that I do not consider myself an atheist , but definitely do not believe in the christian god . The recent discussion about atheists and hell , combined with a post to another group ( to the effect of 'you will all go to hell ' ) has me interested in the consensus as to how a god might judge men . As a catholic , I was told that a jew , buddhist , etc . might go to heaven , but obviously some people do not believe this . Even more see atheists and pagans ( I assume I would be lumped into this category ) to be hellbound . I know you believe only god can judge , and I do not ask you to , just for your opinions .

Actually the reasons you do n't see so many cooling towers at fossil plants are 1 ) fossil units ( multiple units per plant ) are generally smaller than nuclear plants . 300 MWe seemed to be a very popular size when many fossil plants were built . The average nuclear plant is 1000 MWe . 2 ) many fossil plants were grandfathered when water discharge regulations were adopted ( `` why those old dirt burners ca n't harm anything , let 'em go. '' ) . 3 ) powered draft cooling towers , low enough to the ground to be generally not visible from off-site , are quite popular with fossil plants . 4 ) fossil plants used to get much less regulatory attention than nuclears . > Actually , fossil fuel plants run hotter than the usual > boiling-water reactor nuclear plants .

Some plants do cool the condensers with water , > rather than air ; as one Canadian official , asked about `` thermal > pollution '' de-icing a river , said , `` Up here , we view heat as a resource '' . Actually the condensing environment is essentially the same for plants of similar size . The issues are the same regardless of where the heat comes from . Condensers are run at as high a vacuum as possible in order to reduce aerodynamic drag on the turbine . The condenser pressure is normally water 's vapor pressure at the condensing temperature . It is desirable that the steam exhaust be free of water droplets because moisture in the steam causes severe erosion damage to the turbine low pressure blades and because entrained water moving at high velocity causes erosion of the condenser tubes . The coldest and thus lowest pressure condensing environment is always the best . A related issue is that of pumping the condensate from the hotwell ( where the water ends up after dripping off the condenser tubes . ) Since the condenser is at a very low pressure , the only force driving the condensate into the hotwell pumps is gravity . If the condensate is too hot or the gravity head is too low , the condensate will reflash into steam bubbles and cause the condensate pumps to cavitate . This is a particularly destructive form of cavitation that is to be avoided at all costs . The hotwell pumps are located in the lowest point in the plant in order to provide a gravity head to the pumps . How much lower they must be is a function of how hot the water is allowed to get in the hotwell . Typically hotwell temperatures run between 100 and 120 degrees depending on the temperature of the river water ( this term is used to describe the river grade water even when the cooling tower system is operating in closed loop mode and essentially no river water is pumped . ) When the river water temperature is high in the summer , operators will typically allow the hotwell level to rise in order to provide more gravity head . There is a tradeoff involved since higher hotwell levels will encroach onto the condensing tubes and reduce the condenser area . At least in the East and elsewhere where moisture actually exists in the air : - ) , the river water will almost always be cooler than the discharge water from the cooling towers . The temperature of the discharge water from the cooling towers is set by the ambient air temperature and humidity . It is very rare in the East to hear of actual river water temperatures exceeding 70 degrees . A vast difference from the typical '' 95-95 '' days ( 95 degrees , 95 % humidity ) we see routinely in the East . It is not unusual , particularly where the econazis have been successful in clamping rigid discharge water temperature limits on a plant , for the plant to have to reduce the firing rate when the air temperature gets too high and the condenser can not handle the heat load without excessive pressure . > Everybody runs closed-cycle boilers . The water used is > purified of solids , which otherwise crud up the boiler plumbing when > the water boils . Purifying water for boiler use is a bigger job than > cooling it , so the boiler water is recycled . True . Actually secondary plant ( the part that makes electricity and feeds feedwater to the boiler ) water chemistry has been the bastard stepchild until recently and has not gotten the respect it deserves . The plant chemists have just in the past decade or so fully understood the costs of impure water . By `` impure '' , I mean water with a few dozen extra micromho of conductivity and/or a few PPM of dissolved oxygen . Secondary water is now typically the most pure one will find outside the laboratory . John -- John De Armond , WD4OQC |Interested in high performance mobility ?

Someone else said something similar . I will not comment on the value or lack of value of Elias 's `` proposal '' . I just want to say that it is very distressing that at least two people here are profoundly ignorant of Nazi racial doctrine . They were NOT like Elias 's idea , they were more like the opposite . Nazis believed in racial purity , not racial assimilation . An instructive example is the Nazi attitude to Gypsies . According to Nazi theoreticians , Gypsies were an Aryan race . They were persecuted , and in huge numbers murdered , because most European Gypies were considered not pure Gypsies but `` mongrels '' formed from the pure Gypsy race and other undesirable races . This was the key difference between the theoretical approach to Jews and Gypsies , by the way . It is also true that towards the end of WWII even the `` purist '' Gypsies were hunted down as the theory was forgotten . Brendan . ( email : bdm @ cs.anu.edu.au )

Hams can legally run up to 1500 watts . It is very unlikely , however , that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car . Ham rigs for cars put out around 100 watts . It is possible that a 100 watt radio would cause interference to consumer electronic 100 feet away . Most TVs , stereos , and VCRs have very poor RF shielding . If you experience the problem frequently , it may be caused by a ham , CBer , or other radio operator in a base station nearby . The interference may have been caused by a radio transmitter used for other purposes , such as police , fire , etc . If you heard voices over your stereo , I think you are correct in assuming that the source is an RF transmitter . If you have frequent trouble , you may want to try the RF ferrite chokes available at Radio Shack . The interference is probably being picked up by your speaker wires , and those chokes can be installed on the wires very easily ( without cutting them ) . Good instructions are included with the chokes . If that does not solve the problem , you may want to search your neighborhood for a radio operator . Look for antennas on the roof or car . Talk to him/her about your problem . There are things a radio operator can do to reduce interference . -- =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= Randall Rhea Informix Software , Inc.

I saw : Ford GT-40 ( ! ) , the famous model from Ford , that seemed to win most of its races in the late 60s , including Le-Mans 4 or 6 times . Two Jensen Interceptors , one a convertable , one a hatchback ? Porsche 911 ( boring compared to the rest ) THREE Ferarries , a Mondial , a 308 prepared for racing , and a red 60s model that I could n't identify . And at the bottom , a late 70s MG convertable . Outside there was a rotting Rover 3500 saloon , which was never regularly sold in the U.S. And in the showroom , there was a small italian body , either an Alpha Romeo or a Lancia . It was about the size of an Austin Mini . The trunklid was missing , exposing a boot with a voltage regulator in the upper left corner of the wall , and a chunk of metal removed from the floor on the right hand side as if something would leave the trunk and go to the outside from here . The taillights looked like they would be the round type ( if they were there ) . Does anyone know what the make of this one is ? Certainly made my day ... -- Graham E.

From : af664 @ yfn.ysu.edu ( Frank DeCenso , Jr. ) Subject : MAJOR VIEWS OF THE TRINITY Organization : Youngstown State/Youngstown Free-Net Lines : 224 [ With Frank 's permission , I have added some information here ( and in one case changed the order of his contributions ) in order to clarify the historical relationship of the views . My comments are based primarily on William Rusch 's historical summary in `` The Trinitarian Controversy '' , Fortress . I 'm going to save this as an FAQ . -- clh ] MAJOR VIEWS OF THE TRINITY [ SECOND CENTURY The writers of the 2nd Cent . are important , because they set up much of the context for the later discussions . Justin Martyr , Aristides , Athenagoras , Tatian , and Theophilus of Antioch are known as the '' Apologists '' . Their theology has often been described as `` Logos theology '' . Based strongly on wording in John , they took more or less a two-phase approach . Through eternity , the Logos was with the Father , as his mind or thought . This `` immanent Word '' became '' expressed '' as God revealed himself in history , ultimately in Jesus . Thus Jesus ' full distinction from the Father only became visible in history , though the Logos had been present in God from eternity . Rusch regards this view is containing many of the emphases of the final orthodox position , but in a form which is less sophisticated , because it did not have the technical language to properly deal with the eternal plurality in the Godhead . Irenaeus held views somewhat similar to the Apologists . However he was uncomfortable with the two-stage approach . He still viewed God as one personage , with distinctions that did not become fully visible except through his process of self-revelation ( the `` economy '' ) . The distinctions are present in his essential nature . Irenaeus emphasized the Holy Spirit more than the Apologists . Irenaeus ' views should probably be called `` economic trinitarianism '' , though that term is normally used ( as below ) to refer to later developments . THIRD CENTURY -- clh ] Dynamic Monarchianism Source : Theodotus Adherents : Paul of Samosota , Artemon , Socinus , Modern Unitarians Perception of God 's Essence : The unity of God denotes both oneness of nature and oneness of person . The Son and the Holy Spirit therefore are consubstantial with the Father 's divine essence only as impersonal attributes . The divine dunamis came upon the man Jesus , but he was not God in the strict sense of the word . Perception of God 's Subsistence : The notion of a subsistent God is a palpable impossibility , since his perfect unity is perfectly indivisible . The 'diversity ' of God is apparent and not real , since the Christ event and the work of the Holy Spirit attest only to a dynamic operation within God , not to a hypostatic union . Asignation of Deity/Eternality : Father : Unique originator of the universe . He is eternal , self-existent , and without beginning or end . Son : A virtuous ( but finite ) man in whose life God was dynamically present in a unique way ; Christ definitely was not deity though his humanity was deified . Holy Spirit : An impersonal attribute of the Godhead . No deity or eternality is ascribed to the Holy Spirit . Criticism ( s ) : Elevates reason above the witness of biblical revelation concerning the Trinity . Categorically denies the deity of Christ and of the Holy Spirit , thereby undermining the theological undergirding for the biblical doctrine of salvation . [ In summary , this probably best thought of as not being Trinitarianism at all . God is an undifferentiated one . Son and Holy Spirit are seen as simply names for the man Jesus and the grace of God active in the Church . -- clh ] Modalistic Monarchianism Source : Praxeas Adherents : Noatus , Sabellius , Swedenborg , Scleiermacher , United Pentecostals ( Jesus Only ) Perception of God 's Essence : The unity of God is ultra-simplex . He is qualitatively characterized in his essence by one nature and person . This essence may be designated interchangeably as Father , Son , and Holy Spirit . They are different names for but identical with the unified , simplex God . The three names are the three modes by which God reveals Himself . Perception of God 's Subsistence : The concept of a subsistent God is erroneous and confounds the real issue of the phenomenon of God 's modalistic manifesting of himself . The paradox of a subsisting `` three in oneness '' is refuted by recognizing that God is not three persons but one person with three different names and corresponding roles following one another like parts of a drama . Asignation of Deity/Eternality : Father : Fully God and fully eternal as the primal mode or manifestation of the only unique and unitary God Son : Full deity/eternality ascribed only in the sense of his being another mode of the one God and identical with his essence . he is the same God manifested in temporal sequence specific to a role ( incarnation ) . Holy Spirit : Eternal God only as the tile designates the phase in which the one God , in temporal sequence , manifested himself pursuant to the role of regeneration and sanctification . Criticism ( s ) : Depersonalizes the Godhead . To compensate for its Trinitarian deficiencies , this view propounds ideas that are clearly heretical . Its concept of successive manifestations of the Godhead can not account for such simultaneous appearances of the three persons as at Christ 's baptism . [ Rusch comments that evidence on these beliefs is sketchy . There are actually two slightly different groups included : Noetus and his followers , and Sabellius . Noetus was apparently more extreme . Sabellius followed him , and attempted to use some features of economic Trinitarianism to create a more sophisticated view . Unfortunately , information about Sabellius comes from a century later , and there seems to be some confusion between him and Marcellus of Ancyra . -- clh ] [ I 've moved the following description to be with the other third-century views . It originally appeared near the end . -- clh ] '' Economic '' Trinitarianism Source : Hippolytus , Tertullian Adherents : Various `` neo-economic '' Trinitarians Perception of God 's Essence : The Godhead is characterized by triunity : Father , Son , and Holy Spirit are the three manifestations of one identical , indivisible substance . The perfect unity and consubstantiality are especially comprehended in such manifest Triadic deeds as creation and redemption . Perception of God 's Subsistence : Subsistence within the Godhead is articulated by means of such terms as `` distinction '' and `` distribution '' dispelling effectively the notion of separateness or division . Asignation of Deity/Eternality : The equal deity of Father , Son , and Holy Spirit is clearly elucidated in observation of the simultaneous relational/operational features of the Godhead . Co-eternality , at times , does not intelligibly surface in this ambiguous view , but it seems to be a logical implication . Criticism ( s ) : Is more tentative and ambiguous in its treatment of the relational aspect of the Trinity . [ Note that this is a development of the Apologists and Irenaeus , as mentioned above . As with them , the threeness is visible primarily in the various ways that God revealed himself in history . However they did say that this is a manifestation of a plurality that is somehow present in the Godhead from the beginning . Tertullian talks of the Father , Son , and Holy Spirit as being three that are one in substance . Many people regard this view as being essentially orthodox , but with less developed philosophical categories . -- clh ] [ Origen , developing further an approach started by Clement , attempted to apply neo-Platonism to Christian thought . He set many of the terms of the coming battle . In Platonic fashion , he sees the Son as a mediator , mediating between the absolute One of God and the plurality of creating beings . The Son is generated , but he is `` eternally generated '' . That is , the relationship between Father and Son is eternal . It can not be said that `` there was once when he was not '' ( a phrase that will haunt the discussion for centuries ) . Having the Son is intrinsic to his concept of God . The Father and Son are described as separate `` hypostases '' , though this may not have quite the meaning of separate subsistence that it had in some contexts . The union is one of love and action , but there is some reason to think that he may have used the term homoousios ( `` of the same substance '' ) . The Holy Spirit is also an active , personal substance , originated by the Father through the Son . Origen 's intent is trinitarian , not tritheistic , but he pushes things in the direction of separateness . FOURTH CENTURY -- clh ] Subordinationism [ often called Arianism -- clh ] Source : Arius Major Adherents : Modern Jehovah 's Witnesses , and several other lesser known cults Perception of God 's Essence : The inherent oneness of God 's nature is properly identifiable with the Father only . The Son and the Holy Spirit are discreet entities who do not share the divine essence . Perception of God 's Subsistence : The unipersonal essence of God precludes the concept of divine subsistence with a Godhead . `` Threeness in oneness '' is self- contradictory and violates biblical principles of a monotheistic God . Asignation of Deity/Eternality : Father : The only one , unbegotten God who is eternal and without beginning . Son : A created being and therefore not eternal . Though he is to be venerated , he is not of the divine essence . Holy Spirit : A nonpersonal , noneternal emanation of the Father . He is viewed as an influence , an expression of God . Deity is not ascribed to him . Criticism ( s ) : It is at variance with abundant scriptural testimony respecting the deity of both Christ and the Holy Spirit . Its hierarchial concept likewise asserts three essentially separate persons with regard to the Father , Christ , and the Holy Spirit . This results in a totally confused soteriology . [ Note also that in most versions of this view , the Son is not fully human either . He is supernatural and sinless . That distinguishes this view from adoptionism . -- clh ] Orthodox Trinitarianism Source : Athanasius Adherents : Basil , Gregory of Nyssa , Gregory of Nazianzus , Augustine , Thomas Aquinas , Luther , Calvin , Contemporary orthodox Christianity Perception of God 's Essence : God 's being is perfectly unified and simplex : of one essence . This essence of deity is held in common by Father , Son , and Holy Spirit . The three persons are consubstantial , coinherent , co-equal , and co- eternal . Perception of God 's Subsistence : The divine subsistence is said to occur in three modes of being or hypostases . As such , the Godhead exists `` undivided in divided persons . '' This view contemplates an identity in nature and cooperation in function without the denial of distinctions of persons in the Godhead . Asignation of Deity/Eternality : In its final distillation , this view unhesitatingly sets forth Father , Son , and Holy Spirit as co-equal and co-eternal in the Godhead with regard to both the divine essence and function . Criticism ( s ) : The only shortcoming has to do with the limitations inherent in human language and thought itself : the impossibility of totally describing the ineffable mystery of `` three in oneness . '' [ At least in the 4th Cent , there were several different approaches , all of which fit the description here , and all regarded as orthodox , but which are somewhat different in detail . Nicea was originally held to respond to Arius . Arius can be thought of as carrying Origen 's thought a bit too far , to the point of making the Son a separate entity . In general the East tended to take an approach based on Origen 's , and it was hard to get acceptance of Nicea in the East . Its final acceptance was based on the work of Athanasius with the Cappadocians : Gregory of Nyssa and Gregory of Nazianzus , among others . While starting with three , they show that their unity in nature and and action is such that one must think of them as being a single God . This allowed the Council of Constantinople , in 381 , to get wide agreement on the idea of three hypostatese and one ousia . -- clh ] Adapted from _Charts of Christian Theology and Doctrine_ , by H.

Anybody know ? I do n't know , but I 'm as willing to speculate as anyone . Several people have suggested that the chips use public-key cryptography . Another possibility is to use Diffie-Hellman key exchange , or some other algorithm which has a similar effect . DH allows both ends to agree on a session key which they use with symmetric cryptography ( something like DES ) for the encryption . How could the `` back door '' keys work in this system ? I can see a few possibilities . One is that the DH-like algorithm has the property that the session key can be deduced by an eavesdropper who knows the back door keys for one ( or possibly both ) communicants . Perhaps the random numbers used in the DH are seeded by the back door key , or some such . Another possibility , as was suggested here earlier , is that the chips simply broadcast the session key , encrypted with the chip 's own internal secret key . In this system the back door keys are secret keys usable for decrypting this session key broadcast . Actually the chip's secret key does n't need to be a public key in this usage , but can be identical to the secret back-door key . ( This proposal seems most straightforward to me . ) Still another possibility is that the encryption algorithm used for the message itself has a `` dual key '' property , that possession of either of two keys can be used to decrypt it . One key would be the session key from the DH exchange , and the other would be the back door key for the chip . It 's worth noting that one of the proposals Dorothy Denning raised during her amazingly prescient on-line discussion last November and December was a variation on Diffie-Hellman in which a third party would participate in deriving the session keys . This does n't quite fit into what we know of how Clipper works but it hints that those who had early knowledge of Clipper ( or whose thinking was somehow synchronized with Clipper designers ) may have had Diffie-Hellman on their minds .

It 's amazing how hard it is to get baseball teams to understand how to properly market their teams and treat their customers . No other business could ever get away with the 19th century attitudes that most current owners display in running their clubs . I guess the owners look at baseball 's high growth rate and ask why it 's necessary to bring 20th century business practices into the game , but they don't realize how much more growth the game is capable of and how much they pay in terms of long-term popularity by not doing better by the game and its fans .

He got more attention from the media than was warranted from his baseball playing , though ; his hype was a lot better than his hitting .

Twenty minutes later , when Jeff 's color had paled to a flush , Matty presented him with an estimate of $ 580 for a busted right mirror and a hairline crack in the fairing .

I also understand that a proving a theory does not necessarily > specify that `` this is how it happened '' , but proposes a likely description of > the phenomena in question . Am I mistaken with this understanding ? Yes , to some degree . There was an excellent discussion in sci.skeptic on the nature of scientific work two weeks ago , I hope it did not escape your notice . The correct word is 'likely ' . There is no way to be sure our models and theories are absolutely correct . Theories are backed up by evidence , but not proved - no theory can be 'true ' in a mathematical sense . However , theories are not mere descriptions or rationalisations of phenomena . It is extremely important to test whether theories can _predict_ something new or not yet observed . All successful theories science has come up with have passed this test , including the Big Bang theory of cosmic evolution , the theory of natural selection etc . It does not mean they _must_ be correct , but they are not mere 'best fits ' for the data . > = But if you claim that there must be > = an answer to `` how '' did the universe ( our spacetime ) emerge from > = `` nothing '' , science has some good candidates for an answer . > All of which require something we Christians readily admit to : `` Faith '' . Well , yes , if you want to _believe_ in them . This is not what science requires - take a good look at the theory and the evidence , see if the theory has made any successful predictions , and use your reason . Disbelievers are not punished . > The fact that there are several candidates belies that *none* are conclusive . > With out conclusive evidence , we are left with faith . This is what puzzles me - why do we need to have faith in _anything_ ? My fellow atheists would call me a weak atheist - someone who is unable to believe , ie , fails to entertain any belief in God . Yes , I know that one ca n't believe without God 's help ; Luther makes this quite clear in his letter to Erasmus .

Tautology at its best . > Carefully examine the original question , and then the `` counter-question '' . > The first asks `` Why '' , while the second is a request for definition . No , it is not , although it does look like one . This is a true dichotomy , either something exists , or nothing exists . If nothing exists , nobody would ask why . If something exists , it is possible to ask why , but actually no existing being could give an answer . Imagine , for a moment , that the nobodies in non-existence could also ask : `` Why nothing exists ? '' This is equivalent to my counter-question , '' why nothing exists in nothingness '' . Now , `` why anything exists '' is equivalent to `` why something exists in somethingness '' . _This_ is what I meant with my tautology , my apologies for the poor wording in my previous post . > I might add , the worldview of `` Things that exist do , and things that > do n't ... do n't '' is as grounded in the realm of the non-falsifiable , > as does the theist 's belief in God .

I do indeed think there probably _is_ no reason for being , or existence , in general , for reasons I stated above . However , they will still leave open the question `` why this , and not that '' , and this is where theistic explanations come in . Science can not give reasons for any _particular_ human being 's existence . > We come to this . Either `` I am , therefore I am . `` , or `` I am for a reason . '' This is a deep philosophical question - is determinism true , or not ? Also , is God deterministic or not ? I tend to think this question has no meaning in His case . If I am for a reason , I 've yet failed to see what it would be . From our perspective , it looks like ' I ' exist for truly random reasons . I just rolled two dice - why did I get 6 and 1 ? How can I believe there is any better reason for my existence ? > If the former is a satisfactory answer , then you are done , for you are > satisfied , and need not a doctor . If the latter , your search is just > beginning . Yes , I am satisfied with this reason , until I find something better . My 15 years of Christianity were of no help in this respect , I have to admit , but I am patient . > = Another answer is that God is the _source_ of all existence . > = This sounds much better , but I am tempted to ask : Does God > = Himself exist , then ? If God is the source of His own existence , > = it can only mean that He has , in terms of human time , always > = existed . But this is not the same as the source of all existence . > This does not preclude His existence . It only seeks to identify His > *qualities* ( implying He exists to *have* qualities , BTW ) . No , it does n't , but I think an existing God can not know why He exists , for an answer to this question is not knowable . Of course , this should not be any obstacle to belief in His existence . > I also have discovered science is an inadequate tool to answer `` why '' . It > appears that M. Pihko agrees ( as we shall see ) . But because a tool is > inadequate to answer a question does not preclude the question . Asserting > that 'why ' is an invalid question does not provide an answer . It is impossible to know unknowable things . However , the question '' why do I exist , in particular '' is _not_ an invalid question - this is not what I said . But from our perspective , it is impossible to tell , and I ca n't just believe in any given explanation instead of another , especially since I found I was deluding myself . > My apologies . I was using why as `` why did this come to be '' . Why did > pre-existence become existence . Why did pre-spacetime become spacetime . I think `` pre-existence '' is an oxymoron . There is no time 'outside ' of this spacetime ( except in some other universe ) , and from that perspective , our universe never was . It exists only for those who are inside it . > But we come to the admission that science fails to answer `` Why ? '' . Because > it ca n't be answered in the realm of modern science , does that make the > question invalid ? No . The validity of the question has to be discussed separately ; I think philosophy is of great help here . What can be known , and what is not knowable ? > M. Pihko does present a good point though .

This is a very good question . In trying to answer this , and numerous other questions that bothered me , I finally found nothing to base my faith on .

It is a `` Panasonic KX-P1124 24 pin Multi-Mode Printer '' . Here are the stats ( from memory and the manual ) : - 360x360 dot-printing for hi-res graphics , etc . - VERY fast ( up to 192 cps ) printing in `` printer-controlled '' ( as opposed to Windows driver-controlled ) printing - Bidirectional printing for faster processing speed - 5 fonts ( `` courier '' , '' prestige '' , '' bold ps '' , '' script '' , '' sans serif '' ) - Epson LQ-2500 and IBM Proprinter X24 printer emulation - Can accept single sheets , envelopes , and 3 non-carbon copies by friction feed - Front or bottom paper feed - 6KB buffer I will send a sample document and a printed GIF/JPEG file to anyone who wishes to send a SASE . With purchase ( prepaid , please ! ) , I will include the following accessories : - Manual - cable ( Centronics ) - remaining stack of tractor-fed paper ( about .4 '' ) - FREE copy of Windows printer driver ( unless this is illegal , or if it is included with Windows ) - FREE unregistered DOS shareware program ( $ 2 registration , I think ) that apparently offers some word processing capabilities from DOS The last two will be on a disk ( either size ) . I am asking for around $ 165 , but I am open to any ( reasonable ) offers . I am a college student , so I can not afford to buy a new printer without getting a considerable portion of the money from this printer . This price includes all above items , and shipping ( probably UPS ) is included as well . I have the original box , but only one of the original Styrofoam end pieces . I will use a towel on the other end ( you get a free towel too ! ! ) . Worked fine getting it here . The whole shebang might not fit in the original box ; I will figure this out after the offers come in .

I knew about this previously , but this past weekend on PBS 's MotorWeek Pat Goss ( their resident tech type ) discussed these products , and recommends not using them ( i.e , the non-isopropyl alcohlo based injector cleaners ) . Supposedly only the isopropyl based cleaners actually remove moisture from your fuel tank as they clean your injectors .

I never said that these alternative means of self-protection involved any hardware . Why are 'good ' neighborhoods 'good ' ? It is n't because every person is armed to the teeth . It is because of ( 1 ) attitude and ( 2 ) cooperation . In the 'good ' neighborhoods , the residents make themselves aware of their neighbors and notice when strangers are lurking around . 'Good ' neighborhoods form groups like 'crime-watch ' to increase this effect , and the relative effectiveness of the police . When hostiles are arrested , the good neighbors step up and say `` THAT 'S the one officer ! He was robbing Mr. Jones ' house '' . In short , the alternative to firepower is gangs ... or at least a benificent manifestation of that social cooperative .

Lines : 36 NNTP-Posting-Host : vela.acs.oakland.edu Tigers ' manager Sparky Anderson gets his 2,000th career win as moments ago , the Tigers completed a two game sweep over the Oakland A 's at Tiger Stadium by beating the A 's 3-2 . Here are the highlights : R H E Oakland 2 9 0 Detroit 3 7 1 Chad Krueter scored Skeeter Barnes from 1st with an RBI double in the bottom of the ninth against none other than Dennis Eckersley to give the Tigers the victory . Barnes also had an RBI single to score Thurmond to tie the score in the ninth , also off Eckersley ( sp ? ) . The A 's got their runs on an RBI single by McGwire in the 1st and a solo homer by Reuben Sierra in the 6th . Deer doubled home Kirk Gibson in the 7th for the other Tiger run . John Doherty pitched another strong game for the Tigers , once again lasting through the seventh inning . He was relieved by Bolton and then David Haas in the 8th , and Haas got the win . Bobby Witt started for the A 's , and was replaced by Honeycutt in the 6th , followed by Goose Gossage in the 8th , and finally Eckersly in the 9th . Doherty gave up both of the A 's runs , while Witt gave up the first Tiger run and Eckerseley gave up the last two . In the post game interview ( on WJR radio in Detroit ) , Sparky Anderson said its one of the few times he 's gotten emotional in his managing career . It was a big moment for him , and I 'm sure all of us Tiger fans are unanimously very happy for him . And what a way to get number 2,000 ! . Considering the circumstances , I think it might be appropriate to say : WOOF ! Go Tigers ! -- Randy

Lev 17:11 : For the life of the flesh is in the blood , and I have given it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls ; for it is the blood that makes atonement for the soul . The Old Testament was very big on the `` eye for an eye '' business . It makes sense that Leviticus would support physical injury to `` repay '' moral wrongdoing . I know about sanctification . I 've been taught all about it in Sunday school , catechism class , and theology classes . But even after all that , I still ca n't accept it . Maybe I 'm still not understanding it , or maybe I 'm just understanding it all too well . From the bottom of my heart I know that the punishment of an innocent man is wrong . I 've tried repeatedly over the course of several years to accept it , but I just ca n't .

( From the Windows Resource Toolkit ( for Win4Workgroups ) ) , add an entry to your `` system.ini '' file under the [ NonWindowsApp ] section : CommandEnvSize=NNNN '' This sets the COMMAND.COM env size , where NNNN must either be 0 or between 160 and 32768 . A value of 0 disables the setting . If this value is too small or too big , it is rounded up to 160 or down to 32768 . If the value is less than the current size of the actual environment , this setting is disabled , as if it were 0 . If you specify the environment size in a PIF file for COMMAND.COM , the PIF setting overrides this setting . The default is 0 with MSDOS versions earlier than 3.2 . Otherwise , the default value is the /e : option in the SHELL= command in CONFIG.SYS . To set this value , you must edit your SYSTEM.INI [ and reboot ] . '' I have used this entry , as well as relied on the default /e : from the CONFIG.SYS shell= line , and both give larger environments . If you do n't use one of these , then the environment passed by windows to each new DOS box is just a little bit bigger than the environment _variables_ present when windows was started . ( No matter how big the DOS env was , when windows starts , it truncates all unused space except for a few bytes . ) This should allow your batch file to run , but your mileage may vary . -- Jerome ( Jerry ) Schneider Domain : jls @ atg.COM Aspen Technology Group UUCP : { uunet } ! csn ! atglab ! jls PO Box 673 , Ft.

From : ran @ doc.ic.ac.uk ( Robert A Nicholls ) Subject : VB to MSACCESS DDE communications Organization : Department of Computing , Imperial College , University of London , UK . Lines : 49 NNTP-Posting-Host : swan.doc.ic.ac.uk A couple of weeks ago I posted a question concerning communicating between VB and MSACCESS using DDE . The answers I received at that time allowed me to get a prototype of my project working . However , during this process I have come up with new problems . 1 ) There seems to be a limit of 255 characters for a DDE Topic string . Is this inherent in all DDE systems or just peculiar to MSACCESS or VB ? 2 ) It is easy to query an Access database from VB using the DDE SQL command , ( provided the above limitation is overcome by using short field and table names ) but how is one meant to update a database ? a ) A DDE SQL UPDATE command does not seem to work . b ) Initiating an Access macro using a DDE Execute command from VB can not be used because when the macro requests information from VB using a second DDE channel the programs dead lock until time- outs occur . ( The VB to Access channel has to close before the Access to VB channel is initiated , I guess . ) c ) Access does not allow VB to DDE POKE the information . The way I eventually managed to update a database was by sending key- strokes from VB to Access using the SendKeys command . This technique has the problem that Access can not be minimised and it must always be in a state ready to respond to the sequence of key-strokes VB sends . Are all the above statements correct or have I made incorrect assumptions ? Are there any better work arounds to the above ? Are there any signs of an ODBC driver for Access ? Bob ran @ doc.ic.ac.uk

From : jhpb @ sarto.budd-lake.nj.us ( Joseph H. Buehler ) Subject : Re : SSPX schism ? Organization : none Lines : 182 Here is some material by Michael Davies on the subject of schism in general and Archishop Lefebvre in particular . He wrote it around 1990 . The first part of the two-part article was on the scandalous activities of Archbishop Weakland ( in this country ) , but I cut all that . And I pared down the rest to what was relevant . Joe Buehler ... Schism and Disobedience According to St. Thomas Aquinas , schism consists primarily in a refusal of submission to the Pope or communion with the members of the Church united to him . On first sight it would appear that , whatever the subjective motivation of the Archbishop , as discussed above , he must be in a state of objective schism as he has refused to submit to the Pope on a very grave matter involving his supreme power of jurisdiction . However , standard Catholic textbooks of theology make it clear that while all schisms involve disobedience not all acts of disobedience are schismatic . If this were so , as was noted at the beginning of this article , it would mean that the number of American bishops who are not schismatic would not reach double figures . The distinction between disobedience and schism is made very clear in the article on schism in the very authoritative Dictionnaire de Theologie Catholique . The article is by Father Yves Congar who is certainly no friend of Archbishop Lefebvre . He explains that schism and disobedience are so similar that they are often confused . Father Congar writes that schism involves a refusal to accept the existence of legitimate authority in the Church , for example , Luther 's rejection of the papacy . Father Congar explains that the refusal to accept a decision of legitimate authority in a particular instance does not constitute schism but disobedience . The Catholic Encyclopedia explains that for a Catholic to be truly schismatic he would have to intend `` to sever himself from the Church as far as in him lies . '' It adds that `` not every disobedience is schism ; in order to possess this character it must include besides the transgression of the command of the superiors , a denial of their divine right to command . `` Not only does Mgr . Lefebvre not deny the divine right of the Pope to command , but he affirms repeatedly his recognition of the Pope 's authority and his intention of never breaking away from Rome . The Archbishop made his attitude clear in the July/August 1989 issue of 30 Days : `` We pray for the Pope every day . Nothing has changed with the consecrations last June 30 . We are not sedevacantists . We recognize in John Paul II the legitimate Pope of the Catholic Church . We do n't even say that he is a heretical Pope . We only say that his Modernist actions favor heresy . '' ... Intrinsically Schismatic ? The principal argument used by those claiming that Mgr . Lefebvre is in schism is that the consecration of a bishop without a papal mandate is an intrinsically schismatic act . A bishop who carries out such a consecration , it is claimed , becomes ipso facto a schismatic . This is not true . If such a consecration is an intrinsically schismatic act it would always have involved the penalty of excommunication . In the 1917 Code of Canon Law the offence was punished only by suspension ( see Canon 2370 of the 1917 Code ) . Pope Pius XII had raised the penalty to excommunication as a response to the establishment of a schismatic church in China . The consecration of these illicit Chinese bishops differed radically from the consecrations carried out by Mgr . Lefebvre as the professed intention was to repudiate the authority of the Pope , that is , to deny that he has the right to govern the Church , and the illicitly consecrated Chinese bishops were given a mandate to exercise an apostolic mission . Neither Archbishop Lefebvre nor any of the bishops he has consecrated claim that they have powers of jurisdiction . They have been consecrated solely for the purpose of ensuring the survival of the Society by carrying out ordinations and also to perform confirmations . I do not wish to minimize in any way the gravity of the step take by Mgr . Lefebvre . The consecration of bishops without a papal mandate is far more serious matter than the ordination of priests as it involves a refusal in practice of the primacy or jurisdiction belonging by divine right to the Roman Pontiff . But the Archbishop could argue that the crisis afflicting the Church could not be more grave , and that grave measures were needed in response . It appears to be taken for granted by most of the Archbishop 's critics that he was excommunicated for the offense of schism , and the Vatican has certainly been guilty of fostering this impression . There is not so much as a modicum of truth in this allegation . The New Code of Canon Law includes a section beginning with Canon 1364 entitled '' Penalties for Specific Offenses '' ( De Poenis in Singula Dicta ) . The first part deals with `` Offenses against Religion and the Unity of the Church '' ( De Delictis contra Religionem et Ecclesiae Unitatem ) . Canon 1364 deals with the offense of schism which is , evidently , together with apostasy and heresy , one of the three fundamental offenses against the unity of the Church . But the Archbishop was not excommunicated under the terms of this canon or , indeed , under any canon involving an offense against religion or the unity of the church . The canon cited in his excommunication comes from the third section of `` Penalties for Specific Offenses '' which is entitled `` Usurpation of Ecclesial Functions and Offenses in their Exercise '' ( De Munerum Ecclesiasticorum Usurpatione Degue Delictis iniis Exercendis ) . The canon in question is Canon 1382 , which reads : `` A bishop who consecrates someone bishop and the person who receives such a consecration from a bishop without a pontifical mandate incur an automatic ( latae sententiae ) excommunication reserved to the Holy See . '' The scandalous attempts to smear Archbishop Lefebvre with the offense of schism are , then , contrary to both truth and charity . A comparable smear under civil as opposed to ecclesiastical law would certainly justify legal action for libel involving massive damages . An accurate parallel would be to state that a man convicted of manslaughter had been convicted of first degree murder . I must stress that what I have written here is not the dubious opinion of laymen unversed in the intricacies of Canon Law . Canon lawyers without the least shred of sympathy for Mgr . Lefebvre have repudiated the charge of schism made against him as totally untenable . Father Patrick Yaldrini , Dean of the Faculty of Canon Law of the Institut Catholique in Paris noted in the 4 July 1988 issue of Valeurs actuelles that , as I have just explained , Mgr . Lefebvre was not excommunicated for schism but for the usurpation of an ecclesiastical function . He added that it is not the consecration of a bishop which constitutes schism but the conferral of an apostolic mission upon the illicitly consecrated bishop . It is this usurpation of the powers of the sovereign pontiff which proves the intention of establishing a parallel Church . Cardinal Rosalio Lara , President of the Pontifical Commission for the Authentic Interpretation of Canon Law , commented on the consecrations in the 10 July 1988 issue of la Repubblica . It would be hard to imagine a more authoritative opinion . The Cardinal wrote : The act of consecrating a bishop ( without a papal mandate ) is not in itself a schismatic act . In fact , the Code that deals with offenses is divided into two sections . One deals with offenses against religion and the unity of the Church , and these are apostasy , schism , and heresy . Consecrating a bishop with a pontifical mandate is , on the contrary , an offense against the exercise of a specific ministry . For example , in the case of the consecrations carried out by the Vietnamese Archbishop Ngo Dinh Thuc in 1976 and 1983 , although the Archbishop was excommunicated he was not considered to have committed a schismatic act because there was no intention of a breach with the Church . ... . It is not simply unjust but ludicrous to suggest that in consecrating bishops without a papal mandate Archbishop Lefebvre had the least intent of establishing a schismatic church . He is not a schismatic and will never be a schismatic . The Archbishop considers correctly that the the Church is undergoing its worst crisis since the Arian heresy , and that for the good of the Church it was necessary for him to consecrate the four bishops to ensure the future of his Society . Canon Law provides for just such a situation , and even if one believes that the future of the Society could have been guaranteed without these consecrations , the fact that the Archbishop believed sincerely that it could not means , as Canon Law states clearly , that he has not incurred excommunication . Furthermore , while the Vatican allows such prelates as Archbishop Weakland to undermine the Faith with impunity it can not expect Catholics to pay the least attention to its sanctions against a great and orthodox Archbishop whose entire life has been devoted to the service of the Church and the salvation of souls . Dr. Eric M. de Saventhem , President of the International Una Voce Association , is one of the best informed laymen in the Church , and he knows the Archbishop intimately . Dr. de Saventhem , like myself , has no greater desire than to see a reconciliation between Mgr . Lefebvre and the Holy See during the Archbishop 's lifetime . A quotation from a statement by Dr. de Saventhem which was published in the 15 February 1989 Remnant merits careful study : In retrospect , the road leading to the consecrations of 30 June appears more paved with grave Roman ( and , unfortunately , also papal ) omissions than with Lefebvrist `` obstinancies . '' And from the eyes of an informed public this can not be hidden by attempting to present the Archbishop 's act of grave disobedience as an offense against the Faith ! It is said -- today -- that Mgr . Lefebvre has `` an erroneous concept of Tradition . '' If this were so , Cardinal Ratzinger could not , on behalf of the Pope , have addressed to the Archbishop the following words in his letter of 28 July 1987 : `` Your ardent desire to safeguard Tradition by procuring for it 'the means to live and prosper ' testifies to your attachment to the Faith of all time ... the Holy Father understands your concern and shares it .

That 's really sad when two second-rate goalies ( Barasso and Belfour ) are the main contenders for the Vezina . Call me crazy , but how about Tommy Soderstrom - five shutouts for a 6th place team that doesn't really play defense . It 's really unfortunate that the better goalies in the league ( McLean , Essensa , Vernon ) had unspectacular years .

The thrust of my argument here is that ( a ) Salameh is , according to US law , innocent as he has not been found guilty in a court of law . As his guilt has not been established , it is wrong for people to make postings based on this assumption . ( b ) Islam teaches us _not_ to harm innocents . If Muslims -- who perhaps have not realized that Islam teaches this -- perform such actions , it is _not_ _because_ of the teachings of Islam , but rather _in spite of_ and _in contradiction to_ the teachings of Islam . This is an important distinction . I should clarify what Muslims usually mean when they say `` Muslim '' . In general , anyone who calls themselves a `` Muslim '' and does not do or outwardly profess something in clear contradiction with the essential teachings of Islam is considered to be a Muslim . Thus , one who might do things contrary to Islam ( through ignorance , for example ) does not suddenly _not_ become a Muslim . If one knowingly transgresses Islamic teachings and essential principles , though , then one does leave Islam . The term `` Muslim '' is to be contrasted with `` Mu'min '' , which means `` true believer '' . However , whether a Muslim is in reality a Mu'min is something known only by God ( and perhaps that person himself ) . So you will not find the term Mu'min used very much by Muslims in alt.atheism , because it is not known to anybody ( except myself and God ) , whether I , for example , am a `` true believer '' or not . For example , I could just be putting on a show here , and in reality believe something opposite to what I write here , without anyone knowing . Thus , when we say `` Muslims '' we mean all those who outwardly profess to follow Islam , whether in practice they might , in ignorance , transgress Islamic teachings . By '' Muslim '' we do not necessarily mean `` Mu'min '' , or `` true believer '' in Islam . Fred Rice darice @ yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au

Four coplanar points in the shape of a square have no unique sphere that they are on the surface of . Similarly 4 colinear point have no finite sized sphere that they are on the surface of . These algorithms being geometrical designed rather than algebraically design meet these problems neatly . When determining which plane the 3 points are on if they are colinear the algorithm should afil or return infinite R. When intersecting the two lines there are 2 possibilities they are the same line ( the 4 points were on a planar circle ) they are different lines but parallel . There is a sphere of in radius . This last case can be achieved with 3 colinier points and any 4th point by taking the 4th point and pairs of the first 3 parallel lines will be produced it can also be achieved by If all 4 points are coplanar but are not on one circle . It seems to me that the algorithm only fails when the 4 points are coplanar . The algorithm always fails when the points are coplanar . ( 4 points being colinear = > coplanar ) Testing if the 4th point is coplanar when the plane of the first 3 points has been found is trivial . > An alternate method would be to take pairs of points : the plane formed > by the perpendicular bisector of each line segment pair also contains the > center of the sphere .

How would a man of 7th Century Arabia have known > what *not to include* in the Holy Qur'an ( assuming he had authored > it ) ? This book is worth a read to get a sensible view of this issue . The book is in two sections . Section 1 contains a fairly reasonable analysis of the Bible , showing many inconsistencies between the Bible and modern science . Well we all know that , no surprises . Section 2 analyses the Koran 's version of the Old Testament stories , and seems , on the face of it , to present a good case showing the Koran is consistent with modern science . However , it was plain to me , that this consistency was only possible by the vague phraseology of the Koran . Take the flood , for example , the bible is full of detail , ( `` forty days and forty nights '' , `` pair of every animal '' , etc . ) , we all know this is nonsense . The Koran 's description of the same event is so obscure as to make possible an interpretation such as `` A big river flooded for a few days and caused much damage '' . Yes , no contradiction but also not much fact . The Koran might be consistent with modern science , but being consistent due to its vagueness compared with other books of that time , does not seem much of an achievement . The book concludes by saying something like , the Koran must have had divine inspiration because at the time it was written there were a lot of ( to us now ) ridiculous ideas about the universe , and none of them can be found in the Koran ! Arguing for the greatness of a book by talking about what it does not contain seems absurd in the extreme .

I have been following this thread and figured I 'd throw in my two cents ... The Amiga Zorro II bus is comparable with the ISA bus ( 7.16 vs 8.33 MHZ ) . The Amiga has had a pre-emptative multi-tasking OS since '85 and can operate with 1 MB RAM ! SCSI is used almost exclusively on these systems . A SCSI controller that transfers data by DMA allows the cpu to request data from the hard drive and continue working while the controller gets the data and moves it to memory . A controller that allows reselection can operate even better with multiple devices . This is espically true with SCSI tape units . For example , when rewinding or formatting a tape , the command is issued to the controller and the bus is released to allow access to other devices on the bus . This greatly increases productivity or , at least , do something else while backing up your hard drive : - ) . Which happens to be what I am doing while reading this group . Its a long story , but I still use IDE on my 486 except for the CDROM which , thanks to SCSI , I can move between both machines . If , and when , SCSI is better standardized and supported on the ibm-clone machines , I plan to completely get rid of IDE . -- Wayne Summer // AMIGA - Simply the Best . Palm Bay , FL .

After comparing the above strings with my AT commands reference guide , I came up with : ATZ0L2N2X5 & D0S11=50^M This is entered in the 'Initialize ' box on the 'Modem Preferences ' in Zterm . Quick summary of each commmand : Z0 - Reset modem to User Profile 0 . L2 - Speaker volume at 2 ( fairly quiet ) N2 - Ring volume at 2 ( fairly quiet ) X5 - Display connect info according to setting 5 ( see manual ) & D0 - Assume DTR ( computer ) is always on S11=50 - Dial speed at 50 ( as fast as ZyXEL can handle ) In FirstClass , I used this same string , with the addition of S0=0 right before the S11 command , in the setup box . This disables the auto-answer function of the modem for FirstClass . I based my modem setting on the Supra 14.4FAX , and just changed the above mentioned string . In Telefinder , I based my setting on the Zoom V42 - HH setting . I changed the 'Modem Initialization ' string to the same one I used for FirstClass , and everything seems to work fine .

From : dbm0000 @ tm0006.lerc.nasa.gov ( David B. Mckissock ) Subject : NASA `` Wraps '' News-Software : VAX/VMS VNEWS 1.41 Nntp-Posting-Host : tm0006.lerc.nasa.gov Organization : NASA Lewis Research Center / Cleveland , Ohio Lines : 133 In the April edition of `` One Small Step for a Space Activist '' , Allen Sherzer & Tim Kyger write : `` Another problem is what are called 'wraps ' ( or sometimes the 'center tax ' ) . When work for a large program like Freedom or Shuttle is performed at a NASA center , the center skims off a portion which goes into what amounts to a slush fund . This money is used to fund work the center manager wants to fund . This sum is estimated to be over a third of the funds allocated . Think about that : Of the $ 30 billion cost of Freedom , fully $ 10 billion wo n't be spent on anything having anything to do with Space Stations ! Now , maybe that $ 10 billion was wisely spent ( and maybe it was n't ) , but the work done with it should stand on its own merits , not distorting the cost of other projects . Congress has no idea of the existense of these wraps ; Congress has never heard the term 'center tax ' . They look at the Station they are getting and the price they are paying and note that it does n't add up . They wonder this blissfully unaware that a third of the money is going for something else . '' My dear friends , your mixing fact and fiction here . A couple of weeks ago , when I first read this in your posting , I talked with one of the cost experts here in Space Station at Headquarters [ if you wondering why I did n't post a response immediately , I do have a real job I 'm supposed to be doing here at Headquarters , & digging up old 20 kHz data & looking into Sherzer/Kyger claims rates pretty low on the totem pole of priority . Also , I spent last weekend in Kansas City , at the National Science Teachers Association conference , extolling the virtues of SSF to 15,000 science teachers . ] First off , yes , the concept of 'center tax ' , or 'wrap ' does exist . If I recall the numbers correctly , the total 'tax' for the SSF program for this fiscal year is around $ 40 Million . This was computed by adding up the WP-1 , WP-2 , and WP-4 center 'taxes ' . With the SSF budget for this fiscal year at $ 2.2 Billion , my calculater says the tax percentage is 04/2.2 = 1.8 % Over the life of the SSF program , using your figure of $ 30 billion for the cost of SSF , a tax at a 1.8 % rate comes to $ 540 million . This is alot less than $ 10 billion , but I will concede it 's still an appreciable amount of pocket change . I should note that your estimate of the tax rate at 1/3 could be close to the actual rate . The tax is only charged on funds that are spent at the center ( kind of like McDonalds at some states , where you do have to pay sales tax if you eat the food at the restaurant , but you do n't if you get it take-out ) . For example , at WP-4 , the vast bulk of the funds we receive go to the Rocketdyne Contract , and are *NOT* subject to the center tax ( I do n't have the numbers in front of me , but I 'd guess at least 95 % of the WP-4 funds go to Rocketdyne ) . So , you could be right about a tax rate of 1/3 , but it 's only applied to funds spent at the center , and not to the prime contracts . This leads to the obvious question `` What is the government doing with SSF funds that do n't go to the prime contractors ? ( i.e . ok , WP-4 gets a slice of the $ 30 billion pie . A big portion of this slice goes to Rocketdyne . What happens to the balance of the funds , which are n't eaten up by the center tax ? ) '' At WP-4 , we call these funds we spend in-house supporting development funds ( as they are supporting the development work done by Rocketdyne ) . We have used these funds to setup our own testbed , to checkout the electrical power system architecture . Our testbed has a real life solar array field ( left over from solar cell research research a few years back ) , with lead-acid car batteries ( to simulate the Nickel-Hydrogen batteries on SSF ) , DC switchgear , DC-DC converter units , and simulated loads . Data from the testbed was used in a recent change evaluation involving concerns about the stability of the power system . We have also used the supporting development money to purchase Nickel Hydrogen batteries , which are on life testing at both Lewis and the Crane Naval facility in Indiana . As a side point , 6 of the battery cells on test recently hit the four year life test milestone . 38 cells have completed 18,552 to 23,405 cycles ( the on-orbit batteries go through 5,840 cycles per year ) . As a final example , my 'home ' division at Lewis used the supporting development funds to purchase personal computers and work stations , for performing system analyses ( like modeling of the performance of the electrical power system , availability calculations using a Monte-Carlo simulation , setting up a database with information on weight of the power system elements ) . Finally , the money raised by the 'tax ' does not all go into a 'slush fund . ' At Lewis , the director does control a small discretionary fund . Each year , any individual at Lewis can submit a proposal to the director to get money from this fund to look at pretty much anything within the Lewis Charter . Most of the tax , however , goes to fund the 'general' services at the Center , like the library , the central computer services division , the Contractor who removes the snow , etc . Thus , it is rather difficult to determine what percentage of the SSF budget does n't go for SSF activities . To get an accurate figure , you would have to take the annual expenditure for the library ( for example ) , and then divide by the amount of the library funds used to support SSF ( which would be hard to compute by itself - how would you figure out what percentage of the bill for Aviation Week for 1 year is 'billable ' to SSF , would you base it on the person-hours SSF employees spend reading AV-week versus the rest of the center personnel ) . You would then have to compare this estimate of the SSF portion of the library expense with the portion of the tax that goes to support the library . Who knows , maybe SSF overpays on the tax to run the library , but we underpay for snow removal ? Talk about a burecratic nightmare ! My last point is that I ca n't believe your claim that Congress has never heard of the term 'center tax . ' Unfortunately , all of the NASA testimony before Congress is n't on a computer , so I ca n't do a simple word search someplace to prove you wrong . But surely , in some GAO audit somewhere , these NASA cost methods were documented for Congress ?

From : bmdelane @ quads.uchicago.edu ( brian manning delaney ) Subject : Re : diet for Crohn 's ( IBD ) Reply-To : bmdelane @ midway.uchicago.edu Organization : University of Chicago Lines : 27 One thing that I have n't seen in this thread is a discussion of the relation between IBD inflammation and the profile of ingested fatty acids ( FAs ) . I was diagnosed last May w/Crohn 's of the terminal ileum . When I got out of the hospital I read up on it a bit , and came across several studies investigating the role of EPA ( an essentially FA ) in reducing inflammation . The evidence was mixed . [ Many of these studies are discussed in `` Inflammatory Bowel Disease , '' MacDermott , Stenson . 1992 . ] But if I recall correctly , there were some methodological bones to be picked with the studies ( both the ones w/pos . and w/neg . results ) . In the studies patients were given EPA ( a few grams/day for most of the studies ) , but , if I recall correctly , there was no restriction of the _other_ FAs that the patients could consume . From the informed layperson 's perspective , this seems mistaken . If lots of n-6 FAs are consumed along with the EPA , then the ratio of `` bad '' prostanoid products to `` good '' prostanoid products could still be fairly `` bad . '' Is n't this ratio the issue ? What 's the view of the gastro . community on EPA these days ? EPA supplements , along with a fairly severe restriction of other FAs appear to have helped me significantly ( though it could just be the low absolute amount of fat I eat -- 8-10 % calories ) . -Brian < bmdelane @ midway.uchicago.edu >

Organization : Kalamazoo College Alumni Association Lines : 28 Greetings , Probably a tired old horse , but ... maybe with a slightly different twist . I wanted to know if there are any good English-language texts for learning ancient Hebrew , and how these compare with German educational texts qualitywise , if anybody has an idea . I ca n't figure out if I should buy one here for later study or wait until I get back to the U.S. Something I find interesting about studying theology in Germany is the fact that the students get their ancient language-learning out of the way early [ I 'm not a theology student , but I spend a lot of time with such folks ] in their careers . They take the first two years or so to just do Greek and Latin and Hebrew [ possibly Aramaic , too -- who knows ] . What 's it like at divinity schools or seminaries in the States ? Is there a lot of language instruction done ? I really do n't have a basis for comparison .

The differential diagnosis between migraine and non-migranous pain is not *always* important , because some therapies are effective in both ( e.g. , tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline , non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen ) . Other therapies may be more specific : beta-blockers such as propranolol work better in migraine than tension-type headache . The most important thing , from your perspective , is that you got relief . Also , please understand that a diagnosis other than migraine does not necessarily mean `` psychogenic '' ; I suspect that organic factors play as large a role in tension-type headache as in migraine . -- - .

After a > couple of seasons you would never see the cup going anywhere outside the > Nordic ( presuming that our teams would have the advantage in drafting > local talent , as prooposed ) . That 's a rather bold claim , in the light of how successful the Canadian & American Olympic teams have been . . . and they 've had to play according to our set of rules and on international ice . The 1992 Olympic teams contained about as much talent as your average expansion team . Canada had Eric Lindros , Sean Burke , Joe Juneau and Chris Kontos . Another four or five have been deep subs in the NHL . As for the Yanks , Keith Tkachuk , Scott Lachance , Bret Hedican , Shawn McEachern , Steve Heintze , Ted Donato , Joe Sacco and Bill Guerin have been 3rd/4th line players in the NHL , while Robb Stauber has done well for the Kings in goal . Nothing more . In fact , I 'm sure that an All-Star team assembled from the best Finnish League teams would do no better in the NHL than Hartford or Tampa Bay currently are doing . -- - But what happens if _all_ top-class Finnish & Swedish players gradually end up with Helsinki & Stockholm as the North American-based ones gradually retire and no Canadian/American team is allowed to draft new players from Scandinavia ? Here is what THE HOCKEY NEWS scouts think of our NHL-based players : ( 28-30=superstar ) ( 23-27=star ) ( 18-22=NHL regular+ ) ( 13-17=NHL regular ) ( 8-12=role player ) FINLAND : D-Jyrki Lumme ... ... .20 D-Teppo Numminen ... .20 D-Peter Ahola ... ... .13 C-Jari Kurri ... ... ..25 C-Christian Ruuttu..16 R-Teemu Selanne ... ..27 L-Esa Tikkanen ... ... 20 ( Obviously , Selanne 's ratings would be higher today than they were in January ) SWEDEN : D-Ulf Samuelsson ... .21 D-Fredrik Olausson..20 D-Niklas Lidstrom ... 18 D-Calle Johansson ... 18 D-Kjell Samuelsson..17 D-Tommy Sjodin ... ... 13 D-Tommy Albelin ... ... 7 C-Mats Sundin ... ... .26 C-Thomas Steen ... ... 18 R-Thomas Sandstrom..22 R-Ulf Dahlen ... ... ..18 R-Michael Nylander..13 L-Per-Erik Eklund ... 18 L-Johan Garpenlov ... 16 L-Mikael Andersson..15 L-Jan Erixon ... ... ..14 This would be interesting . Clearly , Finland 's top five players ( Winnipeg's Selanne & Numminen , Vancouver 's Lumme , Los Angeles ' Jari Kurri and New York's Tikkanen ) are right up there with any five-man unit Pittsburgh & co. have . But I have my doubts about the home-based Finnish players - the national team did well in the Canada Cup and World Championships largely due to the efforts of Markus Ketterer ( the goalie ) , 3-4 or the players listed above and luck . There's presumably a lot of decent players in Finland that would n't be superstars at the highest level but still valuable role players , however . My guess would be that the Finnish Canada Cup team would be a .500 team in the NHL . -- - Sweden is easier to judge because they have more players in North America . Their points total ( 16 players ) is 274 - seven more than Ottawa 's 22 top players combined ! If we estimate there are six more NHL regulars back home in Sweden , an all-Swedish team would assemble about 350-360 skill points . Deducting some points from Pittsburgh , NY Rangers and other teams that rely on Swedish players , the Swedish team would finish in sixth place - about as high as Boston , Vancouver , Calgary and Montreal on paper ! So , the `` dynasty '' talk is n't completely unfounded here . An all-Finnish/all-Swedish team might have an advantage because the players would be playing at home half of the time , wo n't have to adapt to a foreign country and a foreign language , and presumably play the wide-open European variant of hockey rather than have to learn the North American checking game . However , if free agency becomes a factor the top Scandinavian players still might end up playing for large-market teams after a couple of years the same way Edmonton 's `` dynasty '' crumbled in the late '80s . Some fringe players likely will be drafted by other NHL teams as having an exclusive talent pool might be a bit unfair after all . I 'd settle for a compromise , prohibit all European teams from signing a North American during the first two rounds but allow them to keep their top two players . After this , the amateur draft should be open to anyone . > -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - > J O O J O O J O K E R I T ! ! !

Setting Colormaps on multi-top-level APP Keywords : GLX mixed-model , colormap Organization : DSG , Stanford University , CA 94305 , USA Lines : 71 Dear SGI and netter GL-X Mixed-Model experts , I am writing a mixed model application that creates a couple different color maps for different windows , and I 've been having trouble getting the window manager to reliably honor my requests . In some environments ( entry level R3000 Indigo w/ 4.0.5 ) all windows are getting properly connected to their designated color maps , but on others ( an IRIS 4D 240/GTX ; also a different entry level Indigo ) the color mapping is unreliable and changes behavior when I compile at different times . The most common problem is that all non-top-level windows fail to be displayed according to their colormap . My application starts out by creating three top-level windows ; in some cases all but the first of these also fail to be displayed by their colormap . This is spectacularly aggravating . I would dearly appreciate 1. an explanation of the standard , RIGHT , CORRECT way to give a window a colormap such that the Window Manager will Honor and Obey it ; 2. any advice about problems that could cause my failure to get my desired colormaps . By now I have exhausted my own attempts on this , having tried everything reasonable or imaginable . Below is example code giving the schematic for how I have been *TRYING* to do this . Please , please , please SOMEBODY tell me what I am doing wrong/how to do it right ! ! !

Something to bear in mind is what the V in VLB stands for ! V for Video - the origional intention of the bus was to speed up the bus so that large memory to memory transfers would be faster . This is espically useful in transfering data from main memory to video memory . Since there are usually 3 VLB slots card makers have been making cards to fit in the other two . How about an VLB ethernet card ? Move the data into the card at 130 odd MB/s and then wait for it to tickle onto the net at just over 1Mb/s . [ Do do however free the local bus for other cards ] Some times you need fast busses and sometimes you do n't ! > > Thank you ... > > gregof @ jsp.umontreal.ca > > Guy -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Guy Dawson - Hoskyns Group Plc . guyd @ hoskyns.co.uk Tel Hoskyns UK - 71 251 2128 guyd @ austin.ibm.com Tel IBM Austin USA - 512 838 3377

I am programming in Turbo C 3.0 and my program is rather large ( model large too ) . I keep getting errors that I am running out of memory after a while of running the program . When I compile the program , it says I have 4.45 meg of RAM so I ca n't seem to explain why it crashes . All it is doing is running in a loop while the operator is idle and after a while of sitting , it will screw up all the variables . This leads me to believe that my stack is filling up and overflowing . Does the program take memory up when it is calling void functions that do not return anything ? ? I have been working on this problem for days and I would really appreciate any responce . If this is not the correct newsgroup , I will gladly re-post , but this is the only I could find .

A tie is worth one point ( I know , I know . You 're not good at math . But bear with me ) . A win is worth two points . So , getting two ties is the same as getting one win . If your team played two games , won one and lost one , you'd have two points . If my team played two games and tied them both , we 'd also have two points . We 'd be tied in the standings even though our records are different . Perhaps you should learn something about hockey before posting again . ( I am starting to sound like Roger or what ? ) Alan

Leading the first Armenian units who crossed the Ottoman border in the company of the Russian invaders was the former Ottoman Parliamentary representative for Erzurum , Karekin Pastirmaciyan , who assumed the revolutionary name Armen Garo . Another former Ottoman parliamentarian , Hamparsum Boyaciyan , led the Armenian guerrilla forces who ravaged Turkish villages behind the lines under the nickname `` Murad '' , especially ordering that 'Kill Turks and Kurds wherever you find them and in whatever circumstances you find them . Turkish children also should be killed as they form a danger to the Armenian nation . ' ( Hamparsum Boyadjian - 1914 ) [ 1 ] [ 1 ] M. Varandian , `` History of the Dashnaktsutiun , '' p. 85 . Another former Member of Parliament , Papazyan , led the Armenian guerrilla forces that ravaged the areas of Van , Bitlis and Mush . In March 1915 , the Russian forces began to move toward Van . Immediately , in April 11 , 1915 the Armenians of Van began a revolt , massacring all the Turks in the vicinity so as to make possible its quick and easy conquest by Russians . Little wonder that Czar Nicholas II sent a telegram of thanks to the Armenian Revolutionary Committee of Van in April 21 , 1915 , `` thanking it for its services to Russia . '' The Armenian newspaper Gochnak , published in the United States , also proudly reported in May 24 , 1915 that '' only 1,500 Turks remained in Van the rest having been slaughtered . '' Source : Hovannisian , Richard G. : Armenia on the Road to Independence , 1918 . University of California Press ( Berkeley and Los Angeles ) , 1967 , p. 13 . `` The addition of the Kars and Batum oblasts to the Empire increased the area of Transcaucasia to over 130,000 square miles . The estimated population of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000 , of whom 940,000 ( 20 percent ) were Armenian , 1,200,000 ( 25 percent ) Georgian , and 2,220,000 ( 45 percent ) Moslem . Of the latter group , 1,140,000 were Tatars . Paradoxically , barely one-third of Transcaucasia 's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia , where the Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds . Erevan uezd , the administrative center of the province , had only 44,000 Armenians as compared to 68,000 Moslems . By the time of the Russian Census of 1897 , however , the Armenians had established a scant majority , 53 percent , in the guberniia ; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent , or 670,000 of the 1,120,000 inhabitants . This impressive change in the province 's ethnic character notwithstanding , there was , on the eve of the creation of the Armenian Republic , a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the southern districts , from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia . '' ( See also Map 1 . Historic Armenia and Map 4 . Administrative subdivisions of Transcaucasia ) . In 1920 , ' 0 ' percent Turk . `` We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work of extermination . Our troops surrounded village after village . Little resistance was offered . Our artillery knocked the huts into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable and inhabitants fled from them into fields , bullets and bayonets completed the work . Some of the Tartars escaped of course . They found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border into Turkey . The rest were killed . And so it is that the whole length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of Tartar villages . They are quiet now , those villages , except for howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the scattered bones of the dead . '' Ohanus Appressian `` Men Are Like That '' p. 202 .

Leaving Erivan on April 28 , 1915 , Armenian volunteers reached Van on May 14 and organized and carried out a general slaughter of the local Muslim population during the next two days while the small Ottoman garrison had to retreat to the southern side of the lake . '' `` Knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions , Armenians looked to Russia and Europe for the fulfillment of their aims . Armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the First World War with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse to serve their state , the Ottoman Empire , and to assist instead other invading Russian armies . Their hope was their participation in the Russian success would be rewarded with an independent Armenian state carved out of Ottoman territories . Armenian political leaders , army officers , and common soldiers began deserting in droves . '' `` With the Russian invasion of eastern Anatolia in 1914 at the beginning of World War I , the degree of Armenian collaboration with the Ottoman 's enemy increased drastically . Ottoman supply lines were cut by guerilla attacks , Armenian revolutionaries armed Armenian civil populations , who in turn massacred the Muslim population of the province of Van in anticipation of expected arrival of the invading Russian armies .

Meanwhile , Czar Nicholas II himself came to the Caucasus to make final plans for cooperation with the Armenians against the Ottomans , with the president of the Armenian National Bureau in Tiflis declaring in response : 'From all countries Armenians are hurrying to enter the ranks of the glorious Russian Army , with their blood to serve the victory of Russian arms ... Let the Russian flag wave freely over the Dardanelles and the Bosporus . Let , with Your will , great Majesty , the peoples remaining under the Turkish yoke receive freedom .

Are you people for real ? The main legal principles of the Turkish State are summarized in Article 2 of the Constitution : '' The Republic of Turkey is a democratic , secular and social State governed by the rule of law ; bearing in mind the concepts of public peace , national solidarity and justice ; respecting human rights ; loyal to the nationalism of Ataturk , and based on the fundamental tenets set forth in the Preamble of the Constitution . '' Freedom of culture and religion prevailed during the Ottoman Empire , allowing the many nations and races within its boundaries to remain autonomous . The fact that the Ottoman Empire was the longest lived in recent history may be attributed to these freedoms , despite the lack of any written Constitution . The first attempts to create a written Constitution occurred in 1839 and 1856 . Although the documents adopted during these two attempts remained in force only temporarily , they provided the basic elements of a Constitution . The 1876 Constitution was the first legal document to force a Parliament and the right of election to share the sovereignty of the Emperor . The Constitution of 1906 placed some additional limitations on the Emperor , while increasing the power of the Parliament and the government . The First World War ( 1914-1918 ) brought the Ottoman Empire to an end . By the occupation of Istanbul , the Parliament was dissolved and the Constitution was abolished . The members of Parliament were sent to exile to an island by the occupying forces . During the Independence War , the `` Turkish Grand National Assembly '' held their first meeting on April 23 , 1920 to serve as the legislative body of the new Turkish state . This assembly prepared the new legal structure of the Turkish Republic . The new Republic was proclaimed on October 29 , 1923 and the new Constitution was adopted in 1924 . That Constitution served as the legal backbone of today 's modern Turkish Republic . In 1945 , Turkey adopted a multi-party political system . The Constitution of 1924 was replaced by others in 1961 and 1982 . All three Constitutions of the Republic have been based on the principles of parliamentary democracy , human rights , national sovereignty , division of powers , private ownership and secularization . `` Major Principles of the Constitution '' The constitution ( with 177 Articles ) establishes the structure of the Republic within the following principles : - The Turkish Republic is a democratic , secular and social state governed by law ; - It should be governed to maintain public peace , national solidarity , justice , human rights and the objectives of Ataturk ; - The language of the State is Turkish ; - Sovereignty is vested in the nation without any conditions or restrictions . Sovereignty is exercised by organizations authorized by the nation ; - Legislative power is carried by the Parliament elected by the nation . This power can not be delegated ( transferred ) to any one else ; - Executive power is exercised by the President , and Council of Ministers ; - Judicial power is exercised by the independent courts on behalf of the Turkish nation ; - All individuals are equal , irrespective of language , race , religion , color , sex , or political beliefs ; - Laws can not be contradict those principles stated in the Constitution . `` Structure of the State '' In accordance with the Constitution , the structure of the state is based on the principle of `` division of power '' to create a balanced and self-controlled system . The power is divided into `` legislative power , '' `` executive power , '' and '' judicial power , '' balanced to secure freedoms and powers to control each other ( self-control ) . A . Legislative Power : The `` Turkish Grand National Assembly '' is a parliament with one House , elected by the nation for a term of five years to exercise legislative power on behalf of the nation . The basic functions of this Assembly are : - to adopt , to amend , or to repeal laws ; - to approve or to dismiss the Council of Ministers ; - to supervise and to question Ministers or the Council of Ministers ; - to debate , to amend and to approve annual budgets ; - to ratify international agreements ; - to grant amnesty or pardons . Members of Parliament do not have any liability for their words ( either oral or written ) during the course of their legislative duties . The country is divided into constituencies . The number of representatives of each is calculated according to its population . Every Turkish citizen over the age of twenty-one can vote . Elections are supervised by the `` Supreme Council of Elections , '' which solves all disputes or appeals . In each province , the local `` Board of Election '' runs and controls the election under the supervision and guidelines of the Supreme Council . Members of the Council and Boards are elected among independent judges . B . Executive Power : The President of the Republic is the Head of State ( not the head of government as in the Unites States ) . The main functions of the President are : - to represent the State and the Country ; - to insure the implementation of the Constitution ; - to coordinate legislative , judicial and executive functions ; - act as the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces ; - to ratify laws and government decrees . The President is elected by the Grand National Assembly for a period of seven years . The President may ratify or return the laws for a second debate , may call for a referendum . Executive power is exercised by the `` Council of Ministers , '' headed by the Prime Minister . The Prime Minister is appointed by the President from the members of Parliament . The Prime Minister names the Ministers for approval by the President . The new Government ( Council of Ministers ) reads their program at the Parliament and the vote of confidence follows . There are 21 ( ? ) Ministers in the Council . Ministers and other members of the administration can be sued in independent `` administrative '' courts for their misuse of power , administrative errors or functions against any law . C. Judicial Power : Judicial power is exercised by independent courts . No authority or power can instruct the judges or public prosecutors of the courts . These can not be discharged , replaced or retired by executive authorities except for the reasons clearly stated by the appropriate laws . There are three categories of courts in the Turkish judiciary system : - Courts of justice deal with legal , commercial and criminal cases . The decisions of these courts may be reviewed by the supreme court of justice upon the appeal of the parties involved . - The decisions or functions of the executive power ( including the Prime Minister and Ministers or any governmental department ) can be appealed in administrative courts if these functions or decisions are against the law . The decisions of these administrative courts may also be reviewed by the high administrative court . The laws and decisions of the Grand National Assembly can be examined by the `` Constitutional Court '' if they contradict the Constitution . If found contradictory , this court may cancel the decisions or laws of the Parliament .

' ( Ohanus Appressian - 1919 ) 'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists a single Turkish soul . ' ( Sahak Melkonian - 1920 )

Hmmm . Has anyone at your centre monitored the traffic at all ? Are you running any standard MS-Windows programs like Word ? What sort of packets go blazing through ? What size link do you have ( 2Mb or 10Mb ? ) . What is the average traffic flow going through your network or do you have few high peaks and then many low points ? > It all really depends on what the programs are doing ( ie . you 're going > to see a slowdown from X-bandwidth a lot sooner if your apps are all > doing network things also ... ) > -- What do you mean by network things ?

Level 5 ? Out of how many ? What are the different levels ? I 've never heard of this rating system . Anyone care to clue me in ? This is a rating system used by ARPA and other organisations to measure the maturity of a ` software process ' i.e . the entire process by which software gets designed , written , tested , delivered , supported etc . See ` Managing the Software Process ' , by Watts S. Humphrey , Addison Wesley 1989 . An excellent software engineering text . The 5 levels of software process maturity are : 1 . Initial 2 . Repeatable 3 . Defined 4 . Managed 5 . Optimizing The levels are approximately characterized as follows : 1. no statistically software process control . Have no statistical basis for estimating how large software will be , how long it will take to produce , how expensive it will be , or how reliable it will be . Most software production is at this level . 2. stable process with statistical controls , rigorous project management ; having done something once , can do it again . Projects are planned in detail , and there is software configuration management and quality assurance . 3 . The process is defined and understood , implementation is consistent . This includes things like software inspection , a rigorous software testing framework , more configuration management , and typically a ` software engineering process group ' within the project . 4 . Statistical information on the software is systematically gathered and analysed , and the process is controlled on the basis of this information . Software quality is measured and has goals . 5 . Defects are prevented , the process is automated , software contracts are effective and certified . Nick Haines nickh @ cmu.edu

I may not be allergic but I do n't want to take the chance . I do n't react to scallops , but did have discomforts with clam juice served at ( American ) waterfront seafood bars . I do n't know whether the juice is homemade or from cans . The following is my first encounter with the Chinese Restaurant Syndrome . Ten years ago , about an hour after having Won Ton Soup I collapsed in a chair with my face feeling puffed up , my scalp tingling , my feet too weak to stand up . The symptoms lasted for about 20 minutes . Determined to find out the cause of my first reaction , I went back to the Chinese restuarant and ordered the same dish . The same thing happened . A quick look inside the kitchen revealed nothing out of the ordinary . I 've also had a mild attack after having soup at a Thai restuarant .

From : richw @ mks.com ( Rich Wales ) Subject : Sick and tired ( was Re : Bill Conklin ( et al ) 's letter ) Reply-To : richw @ mks.com ( Rich Wales ) Organization : Mortice Kern Systems Inc. , Waterloo , Ontario , CANADA Distribution : na Lines : 92 Replying to A.J . Teel : Well , the two nifty letters giving concrete proof that the Income Tax is voluntary and giving specific procedures for stopping withholding , et cetera have been out there for a while now . Humbug . Those letters do n't provide `` concrete proof '' of anything at all in the absence of any case law that demonstrates the method will actu- ally work for ordinary people in everyday situations . Specifically , show us some case law in which the courts have ruled that income tax is illegal and/or that ordinary working types do not have to pay income tax ( and that they can legally avoid paying income tax with- out declaring themselves to be churches or some such silliness ) . This issue is sufficiently important that I think we have a right to expect something squarely on point from the US Supreme Court ( in the case of federal tax ) or a state 's supreme court ( for a state 's income tax ) . Unless you can do that , I for one am unwilling to call your material '' concrete proof '' . There has been no refutation to date . Have the nay-sayers finally given up as defeated ? Sure would like to hear their reasons for disbelief at this point . Refutation ? ? Refutation of what ? You have n't made a case yet . You've posted plenty of claims , but you have n't given us any valid reason to believe that any court in the US will agree with you . Your claims seem on the surface to deviate so radically from the legal mainstream that I feel the burden of proof is still on =you= to show that your arguments have any merit whatsoever . And the cases you 've cited involve such strange situations that I see no reason to assume that the rulings are applicable to anyone else , or that they will ultimately stand on appeal to the Supreme Court . Why ca n't you just cite us a case in which Joe Schmoe , a regular employee earning regular wages from a regular company , refuses to pay his income tax , gets hauled into court , is convicted of wilful tax eva- sion , and then has his conviction overturned by the US Supreme Court with a landmark 7-2 majority ruling that income tax is indeed totally voluntary ? What , you say ? No such case exists ? Hmmm , I wonder why not ; why have n't you ? Shall I conclude that the point has been received and the opposition has forfeited the field ? With all due respect , you can conclude anything you want . I just hope , for your own sake , that you do n't conclude that anyone in a position of authority in the United States or any legitimate or illegitimate polit- ical subdivision thereof is going to agree with your conclusions . For that matter , I confess I 'm thoroughly confused as to =why= you would be looking for court rulings in your favor anyway -- since I thought you told us earlier that every court in the US has been in cahoots with big banking interests since the 1938 `` admiralty jurisdiction '' coverup thing . Do you honestly expect us to believe that they 'd go to all the trouble to subvert the system , and yet would still promptly slink back into their burrows in the face of anyone who knew enough to invoke the right combination of magic spells and mystic mumbo-jumbo ? Not only that , but why do you even =care= what the US courts say anyway ? Did n't you tell us a while back that you 've disavowed all attempts by US officials to classify you as a `` 14th Amendment federal citizen '' ? When the FBI comes to haul you away for tax evasion , why do n't you just tell them they 're out of their jurisdiction and should go back to Washington , D.C. , where they belong ? Or maybe we should all just go back to mediaeval common law , which you suggested would be better than all these statutes , codes , and the like . If you want to renounce society 's legal framework , fine ; we can just declare you an outlaw , OK ? , and anyone who sees you driving on the roads with no license plate on your car and no driver 's license in your wallet can just take you like a game animal and stew you for their supper ( with plenty of veggies and a pinch of salt , but WITHOUT PREJUDICE UCC 1-207 ) . Sorry , everyone , it 's getting late , and I 'm sick and tired of all this garbage . If I know what 's good for me , I 'll just clam up and stop try- ing to refute this nonsense , and if anyone falls for it and winds up in jail for tax evasion or what-not , it 'll be on their own head . Needless to say , none of the above represents the opinions of my current employer -- who , in any case , is a Canadian and does n't really need to care too much about US tax law . I , on the other hand , am a `` 14th Amend- ment federal citizen '' , with a US passport to prove it , and plan to keep on filing Form 1040 's for the foreseeable future ( though I will probably not owe any US income tax due to the foreign earned income exclusion and/or the foreign tax credit ) . -- Rich Wales < richw @ mks.com > // Mortice Kern Systems Inc.

Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port 2 . X terminals 3 . NeXT 4 . Silicon Graphics 5 . IBM RS/6000 6 . Other stuff 1 . Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port If you 've got a proprietary computer which uses its own keyboard ( Sun , HP , DEC , etc . ) then you 're going to have a hard time finding a vendor to sell you a compatible keyboard . If your workstation runs the X window system , you 're in luck . You can buy a cheap used PC , hook your expensive keyboard up to it , and run a serial cable to your workstation . Then , run a program on the workstation to read the serial port and generate fake X keyboard events . The two main programs I 've found to do this are KT and A2X . a2x is a sophisticated program , capable of controlling the mouse , and even moving among widgets on the screen . It requires a server extension ( XTEST , DEC-XTRAP , or XTestExtension1 ) . To find out if your server can do this , run 'xdpyinfo ' and see if any of these strings appear in the extensions list . If your server does n't have this , you may want to investigate compiling X11R5 , patchlevel 18 or later , or bugging your vendor . kt is a simpler program , which should work with unextended X servers . Another program called xsendevent also exists , but I have n't seen it . Both a2x and kt are available via anonymous ftp from soda.berkeley.edu . 2 . X terminals Also , a number of X terminals ( NCD , Tektronics , to name a few ) use PC-compatible keyboards . If you have an X terminal , you may be all set . Try it out with a normal PC keyboard before you go through the trouble of buying an alternative keyboard . Also , some X terminals add extra buttons -- you may need to keep your original keyboard around for the once-in-a-blue-moon that you have to hit the Setup key . 3 . NeXT NeXT had announced that new NeXT machines will use the Apple Desktop Bus , meaning any Mac keyboard will work . Then , they announced they were cancelling their hardware production . If you want any kind of upgrade for an older NeXT , do it now ! 4 . Silicon Graphics Silicon Graphics has announced that their newer machines ( Indigo^2 and beyond ) will use standard PC-compatible keyboards and mice . I don't believe this also applies to the Power Series machines . It 's not possible to upgrade an older SGI to use PC keyboards , except by upgrading the entire machine . Contact your SGI sales rep for more details . 5 . IBM RS/6000 IBM RS/6000 keyboards are actually similar to normal PC keyboards . || Unfortunately , you ca n't just plug one in . You need two things : a || cable converter to go from the large PC keyboard connector to the || smaller PS/2 style DIN-6 , and a new device driver for AIX . Believe || it or not , IBM wrote this device driver recently , I used it , and it || works . However , they do n't want me to redistribute it . I 've been || told Judy Hume ( 512 ) 823-6337 is a potential contact . If you learn || anything new , please send me e-mail . || 6 . Other stuff Some vendors here ( notably : Health Care Keyboard Co. and AccuCorp ) support some odd keyboard types , and may be responsive to your queries regarding supporting your own weird computer . If you can get sufficient documention about how your keyboard works ( either from the vendor , or with a storage oscilloscope ) , you may be in luck . Contact the companies for more details . Apple Adjustable Keyboard Apple Computer , Inc . Sales offices all over the place . Availability : February , 1993 Price : $ 219 Supports : Mac only Apple has recently announced their new split-design keyboard . The keyboard has one section for each hand , and the sections rotate backward on a hinge . The sections do not tilt upward . The keys are arranged in a normal QWERTY fashion . The main foldable keyboard resembles a normal Apple Keyboard . A separate keypad contains all the extended key functions . The keyboard also comes with matching wrist rests , which are not directly attachable to the keyboard . As soon as soda comes back up , I 'll have a detailed blurb from TidBITS available there .

It's another split-design . One thumb-wheel controls the tilt of both the left and right-hand sides of the main alphanumeric section .

Dragon Systems sells a number of voice recognition products . Most ( if not all ) of them seem to run on PC 's and compatibles ( including PS/2 's and other MicroChannel boxes ) . They sell you a hardware board and software which sits in front of a number of popular word processors and spreadsheets . Each user ` trains ' the system to their voice , and there are provisions to correct the system when it makes mistakes , on the fly . Multiple people can use it , but you have to load a different personality file for each person . You still get the use of your normal keyboard , too . On the DragonDictate-30K you need to pause 1/10th sec between words . Dragon claims typical input speeds of 30-40 words per minute . I do n't have specs on the DragonWriter 1000 .

You may as well know that all this stuff about the secret source of the Clipper announcement is because of a silly mistake . I am the administrator of csrc.ncsl.nist.gov , alias first.org . It 's a system set up to help out the needs of FIRST , a Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams , which includes a number of world-wide incident response teams such as CERT/CC and other places in Europe . As to the VRFY and EXPN commands , they are normally disabled , since early on we did n't want crackers to find out the names of incident response folks on our mailing lists . We had a disk crash several months ago which required completely rebuilding the O/S files - same old story , our backups were n't especially helpful . As you can guess , I didn't remember to re-disable VRFY and EXPN until I saw people on the net trying to find out who was behind clipper @ csrc ... When I saw people 's names posted here , I felt it was time to clear things up . So , EXPN and VRFY on csrc have always been disabled in the past for reasons having nothing to do with Clipper . I posted the White House announcements at the request of policy folks here because csrc also provides Usenet service . I posted them from an account called 'clipper . ' I also created an alias called 'clipper ' that contains the addresses of members of the NIST Computer Security Privacy and Advisory Board , set up under law of the Computer Security Act of 1987 , and addresses of other individuals not affiliated with NIST but involved in cryptography , security , and privacy - I believe that these individuals were included on this list because NIST felt it important to get them the Clipper information first-hand . The 'clipper ' alias is there for the benefit of those named above . It is not a source for information , it was set up solely to monitor any initial traffic . Individuals on the list have requested that they continue to get traffic that is not already duplicated on Usenet . While you can rightfully say we were a bit disorganized in handling this , I would ask that people stop speculating about any hidden agendas or motives of the individuals on the 'clipper ' alias - I 've already apologized to them for what 's happened . Disabling EXPN and VRFY is an increasingly common practice ( albeit unfriendly to some ) , and any effect of disabling it again was unintentional . -John Wack

From : aa888 @ freenet.carleton.ca ( Mark Baker ) Subject : Re : The arrogance of Christians Reply-To : aa888 @ freenet.carleton.ca ( Mark Baker ) Organization : The National Capital Freenet Lines : 58 In a previous article , dleonar @ andy.bgsu.edu ( Pixie ) says : > Do the words `` Question Authority '' mean anything to you ? > > I defy any theist to reply . Well , despite what my mother told me about accepting dares , here goes . You have to be very careful about what you mean by `` question authority '' . Taken literally , it is nonsense . That which is authoratative is authoratative , and to say `` I question to word of this authority '' is ridiculous . If it is open to question , it is n't an authority . On the other hand , it is perfectly reasonable to question whether something is an authority . The catch phrase here should be `` authenticate authority . '' Once you have authenticated your authority , you must believe what it says , or you are not treating it as an authority . The difficulty is that authenticating an authority is not easy . You can perhaps discredit a claim to authority by showing logical inconsistency in what it teaches , or by showing that it does not obey its own rules of discourse . But the fact that I can not discredit something does not , in inself , accredit it . ( Nor does the fact that I can convince myself and other that I have discredited something necessarilly mean that it is false . ) I can not accredit an authority by independantly verifying its teachings , because if I can independantly verify its teachings , I do n't need an authority . I need an authority only when there is information I need which I can not get for myself . Thus , if I am to authenticate an authority , I must do it by some means other than by examining its teachings . In practical matters we accept all kinds of authorities because we don't have time to rediscover fundamental knowledge for ourselves . Every scientist woring today assumes , on the authority of the scintific community , all sorts of knowledge which is necessary to his work but which he has not time to verify for himself . In spiritual matters , we accept authority because we have no direct source ofinformation . We select our authorities based on various criteria . ( I am a Catholic , in part , because the historical claims of the RC church seem the strongest . ) Without authorities there would be no subject matter for belief , unless we simply made something up for ourselves ( as many do ) . The atheist position seems to be that there are no authorities . This is a reasonable assertion in itself , but it leads to a practical difficulty . If you reject all authority out of hand , you reject all possibility of every receiving information . Thus the atheist position can never possibly change . It is non-falsifiable and therefore unscintific . To demand scintific or rational proof of God 's existence , is to deny God 's existence , since neither science , nor reason , can , in their very nature , prove anything . -- ============================================================================== Mark Baker | `` The task ... is not to cut down jungles , but aa888 @ Freenet.carleton.ca | to irrigate deserts .

Center for Regional Studies Lines : 85 04/16/93 1045 ARMENIA SAYS IT COULD SHOOT DOWN TURKISH PLANES By David Ljunggren MOSCOW , April 16 , Reuter - Armenia accused Turkey on Friday of flying weapons x and troops across Armenian airspace to Azerbaijan and strongly hinted it might try to shoot the planes down , local journalists in Yerevan said . Separately , Itar-Tass news agency said Armenian forces had halted their latest offensive which has swallowed up one-tenth of Azerbaijan and sent tensions in the Transcaucasian region soaring . The journalists in the Armenian capital quoted Armen Duliyan , head of the Armenian defence ministry press centre , as saying Ankara had been sending planes up to 15 times a day to Azerbaijan with arms and troops . It looks as though the Armenian leadership will have to warn Turkey about the impermissibility of such actions , '' the journalists quoted Duliyan as saying . `` If such steps are pursued in the future we will have recourse to appropriate measures . We have all the necessary means , including modern anti-aircraft units . '' Turkey , which shares a border with Armenia , has supported Azerbaijan in the conflict over the mainly Armenian-populated Nagorno-Karabakh region in which more than 2,500 people have been killed since fighting erupted in 1988 . The Turkish foreign ministry said on Friday it had so far sent one plane to Azerbaijan containing humanitarian aid . A Turkish foreign ministry spokesman on Thursday would not comment directly on a report by Hurriyet newspaper that a first consignment of rockets , rocket launchers , ammunition and light weapons had arrived in Azerbaijan from Turkey . Duliyan said Turkey had been sending up to 30 trucks a day carrying troops and arms to the bordering Azeri autonomous territory of Nakhichevan , from where they were flown across Armenian airspace to the Azeri capital Baku . `` All the responsibility for possible consequences will be borne by the country which is affording military assistance over our airspace , '' he said . Armenia denies any formal role in the conflict , saying that the troops involved in the fighting are from the enclave itself . Tass said the Karabakh forces decided on Friday to suspend their offensive along the entire Armenian-Azerbaijani front . `` The Karabakh authorities are reportedly ready to give independent inspectors a chance to see for themselves on the spot that the ( enclave 's ) leadership is striving to achieve a ceasefire , '' the agency said . Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan called for a two-stage ceasefire in Karabakh when he arrived in the Belarus capital Minsk on Friday for a summit of Commonwealth leaders . `` The first stage of the settlement should involve a ceasefire and securing the protection of the Karabakh population , '' Tass quoted him as saying . At least 10 ceasefires have been brokered in the conflict but all have collapsed . `` The second stage should involve discussing and finding a solution to the legal issues : that is , a clarification of the status of Nagorno-Karabakh , '' he said . The republic declared full independence last year but the move has not been recognised by any other country . Armenia insists that a separate Karabakh delegation should take part in future peace talks , something Azerbaijan rejects . Local news agencies in Baku said on Friday that Interior Minister Iskender Gamidov , a fiery nationalist and hardliner in the territorial dispute with Armenia , had resigned . Turan news agency said he quit on Thursday and had cleared his office . Khabar-Servis agency said he would be replaced by the military commandant of Baku , police Major-General Abdullah Allakhverdiyev .

He had a surgery when he was one year old . Another surgery had to be performed one year after , when he was two years old . He turned three this February and he is still getting afflicted by this illness , like having to get hospitalised for vomitting and accompanying stomach pain.He managed not having a third surgery so far . * One thing me and my wife noticed is that his affliction peaks around the time he was born , on nearabouts , like in March every year . Any significance to this ? * Why does this recur ? Me and my family go through severe pain when our little boy have to undergo surgery . Why does surgery not rectify the situation ? * Also , which hospital in US or Canada specialize in this malady ? * What will be a good book explaining this disease in detail ? * Will keeping a particular diet keep down the probability of recurrence ? * As time goes on , will the probability of recurrence go down considering he is getting stronger and healthier and probably less prone to attacks ? Or is this assumption wrong ? * Any help throwing light on these queries will be highly appreciated . Thanks very much ! jose @ csd.uwo.ca

So guess what folks , we taxpayers get to pick up the tab ( just as you might have expected ) for people who have never contributed a dime to the U.S. society . I think this government has its priorities ALL SCREWED UP . If they want to help Haitians ... .how about removing the illegal government , how about giving them development aid ? IT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE to waste resources on dying non-citizens who will never be productive in either this country or their own . It does not make sense when the same resources applied or even just plain given to poor people in Haiti could significantly help 100 people in Haiti per 1 AIDS-infected non-citizen immigrant .

There is a protocol limitation that restricts a given Display to at most 255 Screens . I know of no server that handles multiple Displays on a single invocation , unless possibly my kludges to the R4 server can be looked upon as such ; on a TCP-based system there is necessarily a limit of 65535 Displays per machine , but this is not a limitation inherent to X . What you read was most likely talking about a limit in some particular implementation ( probably the MIT one ) . If it claimed there was a limit of 12 inherent to X , the author of the article had no business writing about X. der Mouse mouse @ mcrcim.mcgill.edu

Spreading of Armenian aggression far away from Ukhari ( Upper ) Garabag proves that the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflicts has entered a specially dangerous phase . This is the result of non-recognition of Armenia as an aggressor by the international community , is marked in the document . It is stressed in the statement that the units of the 7th Russian army are participating in the Armenian attack . This casts doubt on the sincerity of Russian mediation efforts in finding a peaceful solution to the conflict . It is marked in conclusion that aggressive actions of Armenia have wrecked the negotiation process under aegis of CSCE . The document contains the appeal to the world community to stop Armenian aggression and to use political and economic sanctions against the aggressor. -- 0 -- Serdar Argic 'We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the Turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination .

From : prz @ sage.cgd.ucar.edu ( Philip Zimmermann ) Subject : Fighting the Clipper Initiative Summary : Ways to fight it Organization : Climate and Global Dynamics Division/NCAR , Boulder , CO Lines : 71 Here are some ideas for those of you who want to oppose the White House Clipper chip crypto initiative . I think this is going to be a tough measure to fight , since the Government has invested a lot of resources in developing this high-profile initiative . They are serious about it now . It wo n't be as easy as it was defeating Senate Bill 266 in 1991 . Possible actions to take in response : 1 ) Mobilize your friends to to all the things on this list , and more . 2 ) Work the Press . Talk with your local newspaper 's science and technology reporter . Write to your favorite trade rags . Better yet , write some articles yourself for your favorite magazines or newspapers . Explain why the Clipper chip initiative is a bad idea . Remember to tailor it to your audience . The general public may be slow to grasp why it 's a bad idea , since it seems so technical and arcane and innocent sounding . Try not to come across as a flaming libertarian paranoid extremist , even if you are one . 3 ) Lobby Congress . Write letters and make phone calls to your Member of Congress in your own district , as well as your two US Senators . Many Members of Congress have aides that advise them of technology issues . Talk to those aides . 4 ) Involve your local political parties . The Libertarian party would certainly be interested . There are also libertarian wings of the Democrat and Republican parties . The right to privacy has a surprisingly broad appeal , spanning all parts of the political spectrum . We have many natural allies . The ACLU . The NRA . Other activist groups that may someday find themselves facing a government that can suppress them much more efficiently if these trends play themselves out . But you must articulate our arguments well if you want to draw in people who are not familiar with these issues . 4 ) Contribute money to the Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) and Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility ( CPSR ) , assuming these groups will fight this initiative . They need money for legal expenses and lobbying . 5 ) Mobilize opposition in industry . Companies that will presumably develop products that will incorporate the Clipper chip should be lobbied against it , from within and from without . If you work for a telecommunications equipment vendor , first enlist the aid of your coworkers and fellow engineers against this initiative , and then present your company 's management with a united front of engineering talent against this initiative . Write persuasive memos to your management , with your name and your colleagues ' names on it . Hold meetings on it . 6 ) Publicize , deploy and entrench as much guerrilla techno-monkeywrenching apparatus as you can . That means PGP , anonymous mail forwarding systems based on PGP , PGP key servers , etc . The widespread availability of this kind of technology might also be used as an argument that it ca n't be effectively suppressed by Government action . I will also be working to develop new useful tools for these purposes . 7 ) Be prepared to engage in an impending public policy debate on this topic . We do n't know yet how tough this fight will be , so we may have to compromise to get most of what we want . If we can't outright defeat it , we may have to live with a modified version of this Clipper chip plan in the end . So we 'd better be prepared to analyze the Government 's plan , and articulate how we want it modified . -Philip Zimmermann

True , it may sometimes be difficult or Still living in an alternate universe ? Numerous articles in major newspapers ( London Times ) and periodicals ( Newsweek ) during the war , had suggested the existence of a significant collaboration between Armenians and the Nazis . Arthur Derounian deserves credit for being the first person to deal with this issue extensively . Derounian 's motives were twofold : his deeply held democratic convictions gave him a sense of duty and he felt obliged to shed light on this yet another dark chapter of Armenian history . Concurrently , Derounian embarked on what one would call 'crisis control ' or face-saving . In order to forestall any potential attacks on the larger Armenian community in the United States , he marginalized collaboration as deplorable but insignificant .

Source : `` Mitteilungsblatt , Berlin , December 1939 , Nr . 2 and 5-6 '' Yet another historical fact : a fact that for years has been deliberately forgotten , concealed , and wiped from memory - the fact of Armenian-Nazi collaboration . A magazine called Mitteilungsblatt der Deutsch-Armenischen Gesselschaft is the clearest and most definite proof of this collaboration . The magazine was first published in Berlin in 1938 during Nazi rule of Germany and continued publication until the end of 1944 . Even the name of the magazine , which implies a declaration of Armenian-Nazi cooperation , is attention-getting . This magazine , every issue of which proves the collaboration , is historically important as documentary evidence . It is a heap of writing that should be an admonition to world opinion and to all mankind . In Nazi Germany , Armenians were considered to be an Aryan race and certain political , economic , and social rights were thus granted to them . They occupied positions in public service and were partners in Nazi practices . The whole world of course knows what awaited those who were not considered `` Aryan '' and what befell them . Now wait , there is more . Source : `` From Sardarapat to Sevres and Lausanne '' by Avetis Aharonian .

With PC articles like the following it is obvious that the problem is NOT with SCSI but with the PEOPLE WHO REPORT IT ! { Like YOU . } Look at the inconsitant use of SCSI in the below quote : ( My comments in { } ) '' Although SCSI is twice as fast as ESDI , { This is asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-1 chip } 20 % faster than IDE ... '' { this is BOTH asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip AND 8-bit SCSI-2 } PC Magazine April 27 , 1993:29 The ARTICLE is confused , NOT SCSI . The TERM is a mess from inconsitant use NOT because the interface itself is a mess . SCSI means `` The set of SCSI interfaces composed of SCSI-1 AND SCSI-2 '' NOT 'SCSI-1 ' as some people want to use it . To read CONSITANTLY the quote SHOULD read : { asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-1 chip } '' Although asynchronous SCSI-1 is twice as fast as ESDI , one third the speed of IDE ... '' or { asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip or 8-bit SCSI-2 } '' Although SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip and 8-bit SCSI-2 are eight times as fast as ESDI , 20 % faster than IDE ... '' NOTE the NONUSE of 'SCSI ' by itself . This eliminates ambaguity . If we are to continue this thread STATE CLEARLY WHICH SCSI you are talking about SCSI-1 or SCSI-2 or SCSI over all { SCSI-1 AND SCSI-2 } . Lumping everything into SCSI as SCSI-1 is SLOPPY , WRONG , and DUMB . Inconsitant SCSI-1 and SCSI-2 usage is also a problem . Clean it up now or have a mess like SVGA was several years ago because everybody and his Uncle slapped 'SCSA ' an their own monitor inteface { SCSI IS standarized unlike SVGA was years ago EXCEPT in terminaology . }

Ex20:8-11 ( JPS ) Remember the sabbath day and keep it holy . Six days you shall labor and do all your work , but the seventh day is a sabbath of the LORD your God ; you shall not do any work - you , your son or daughter , your male or female slave , or your cattle , or the stranger who is within your settlements . For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth and sea , and all that is in them , and He rested on the seventh day ; therefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day and hollowed it .

As Paul closes Romans 14 ( Gaus ) : In short , pursue the ends of peace and of building each other up . Do n't let dietary considerations undo the work of God . Everything may be clean , but it 's evil for the person who eats it in an offensive spirit . Better not to eat the meat or drink the wine or whatever else your brother is offended by . As for the faith that you have , keep that between yourself and God . The person is in luck who does n't condemn himself for what he samples . On the other hand , the person with doubts about something who eats it anyway is guilty , because he is n't acting on his faith , and any failure to act on faith is a sin . [ As far as I know , Christians ( except specific Jewish Christian groups , and maybe some of the sabbatarians -- both of which are very small groups ) do not practice circumcision on religious grounds . In some countries it has been done for supposed health reasons , but I've not heard it argued that it is being done because of the Biblical commandment . -- clh ]
From : tsa @ cellar.org ( The Silent Assassin ) Subject : Questions about Plane Eqn method of Hidden Surface removal Organization : The Cellar BBS and public access system Lines : 18 What are the main advantages of this method ? I have seen it described , and the algiorithm seems a little bit long . I developed my own method , which requires that the points be in a counter-clockwise order , and returns whether you are looking at the back or the front , similar to the plane eqn method . It uses few calculations however , basically it is several comparisons . The only disadvantage I see is that it must be done after the transformation from view coordinates to coordinates to display on the screen , which means that a little more calculation isneeded beforehand . My method basically figures out whether the points that will appear on the screen are clockwise or counterclockwise . When looking at the back of something , the points occur in an opposite direction from the front , so merely by figuring out which way the points go , you can tell whether you are looking at the back or front of a 2d polygon . Has anyone heard of this method before ? It is so simple , I doubt i am the first to think of it . Libertarian , atheist , semi-anarchal Techno-Rat . I define myself -- tsa @ cellar.org

We have a name here that implies certain things to many people . Rather than trying to educate each and every person that comes to the group -- is there some `` name '' that would imply what this group was originally intended for ? My dad was a lawyer -- as such I grew up with being a stickler for `` meaning '' . In my `` reality '' , psychoactives *technically* could range from caffeine to datura to the drugs you mention to more standard recreational drugs . In practice I had hoped to see it limited to those that were above some psychoactive level -- like some of the drugs you mention , but also possibly including *some* recreational drugs -- but with conversation limited to their psychoactive effects -- the recent query about `` bong water '' , I thought was a bit off topic -- so I just hit `` k '' . But back to the original question -- what is a workable solution -- what is a workable name that would imply the topic you with to discuss ? It sounds like there should be a alt.smartdrugs , or something similar -- I do n't feel psychoactives would generally be used to describe alot of those drugs . There is a big difference between a drug that if taken in `` certain doses , over a period of days may have a psychoactive effect in some people '' , vs. many of the drugs in PIHKAH which *are* psychoactive . wm -- : : If pro-choice means choice after conception , does this apply to men too ? : :

The original article has reappeared , so : The President today announced a new initiative that will bring the Federal Government together with industry in a voluntary program to improve the security and privacy of telephone communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement . Hmm , telephone communications could indeed include end-to-end encryption on ordinary landlines . The initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links . But the next paragraph says telecoms networks and wireless communications links . OK , it 's far from clear exactly what Cripple ( what an apposite anagram ) will be applied to , but the reason Joe Public wants secure comms is to stop people listening in to his cellular or cordless phones ( and he wouldn't even be bothered about that were it not for Wingnut and Squidqy's misfortunes ) . Yes , Cripple *might* be for end-to-end encyption , dropping to clear when the other end does n't have Cripple . But then a cordless-to-ordinary conversation would be in clear leaving the cordless end just as vulnerable as at present . Nope , I suspect that Cripple will only be used on radio links . OK , it 's possible ` telecommunications networks ' could mean ` ordinary phone lines ' , but I 'm betting it means the microwave links used by the telcos . My apologies if I 'm wrong , particularly if the turgid Press Release makes it clear that I 'm wrong and I missed it , but as far as I can see it was full of obfuscation , and anyone expecting end-to-end encryption is in for a surprise ( IMHO ) .

If you want to know about events in Palestine it makes more sense to get the news directly from the source . EVERY news source is inherently biased to some extent and for various reasons , both intentional and otherwise . However , the more sources relied upon the easier it is to see the `` truth '' and to discern the bias . Go read or listen to some Israeli media . You will learn more news and more opinion about Israel and Palestine by doing so . Then you can form your own opinions and hopefully they will be more informed even if your views do n't change .

The slow response can be avoided by calling GetValue first , and only using SetValue if the required location is different . The problem can also be avoided by making a tiny alteration in the location of the popup , so that the SetValue really does change the location of the popup . ( We tried this just for a double check on the source of the problem . ) The solutions we have tried successfully are now as follows : 1 ) Use `` twm '' or `` mwm '' rather than `` olwm '' 2 ) Use `` olwm '' , with resource `` *wmTimeout : 10 '' 3 ) Only reset the location of the popup window if it is truely changed .

You like those conclusions ? > I do n't . I think that you are changing the meaning of `` values '' here . Perhaps it is time to backtrack and take a look at the word . value n. 1 . A fair equivalent or return for something , such as goods or service . 2 . Monetary or material worth . 3 . Worth as measured in usefulness or importance ; merit . 4 . A principle , standard , or quality considered inherently worthwhile or desirable . 5 . Precise meaning , as of a word . 6 . An assigned or calculated numerical quantity . 7 . Mus . The relative duratation of a tone or rest . 8 . The relative darkness or lightness of a color . 9 . The distinctive quality of a speech or speech sound . In context of a moral system , definition four seems to fit best . In terms of scientific usage , definitions six or eight might apply . Note that these definitions do not mean the same thing . In my mind , to say that science has its basis in values is a bit of a reach . Science has its basis in observable fact . Even the usages of the word `` value '' above do not denote observable fact , but rather a standard of measurement . I would conclude that science does not have its basis in values , and so your statement above fails . In fact , if one concludes that a scientific set of measurements ( values ) are based on systems derived from observation , then it must follow that in a scientific context , there is no such thing as there is no such thing as '' objective values . '' Back to the present . This has nothing to do with a moral system anyhow . Just because the word `` values '' is used in both contexts does not mean that there is a relationship between the two contexts . If one is to argue for objective values ( in a moral sense ) then one must first start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective . Considering the meaning of the word `` objective '' I doubt that this will ever happen . So , back to the original question : And objective morality is ... .. ? If you can provide an objective foundation for `` morality '' then that will be a good beginning . > -- > Frank O'Dwyer ' I 'm not hatching That' > odwyer @ sse.ie from `` Hens '' , by Evelyn Conlon eric
From : Desiree_Bradley @ mindlink.bc.ca ( Desiree Bradley ) Subject : Being right about messiahs Organization : MIND LINK ! - British Columbia , Canada Lines : 39 I must have missed the postings about Waco , David Koresh , and the Second Coming . How does one tell if a Second Coming is the real thing , unless the person claiming to be IT is obviously insane ? I 'm not saying that David Koresh is the Second Coming of Christ . How could somebody who breaks his word be the Second Coming ? Koresh did promise that he would come out of his compound if only he was allowed to give a radio broadcast . He did n't . Still it seems to me that he did fool some people . And , from my meagre knowledge of the Bible , it seems that Christians have been hard on the Jews of Christ 's day for being cautious about accepting somebody that their religious authorities did n't accept as the Messiah . So I was surprised that nobody had discussed the difficulty of wanting to be early to recognize the Second Coming while , at the same time , not wanting to be credulously believing just anybody who claims to be God . [ Mark 13:21 And then if any one says to you , 'Look , here is the Christ ! ' or 'Look , there he is ! ' do not believe it . Mark 13:22 False Christs and false prophets will arise and show signs and wonders , to lead astray , if possible , the elect . Mark 13:23 But take heed ; I have told you all things beforehand . Mark 13:24 `` But in those days , after that tribulation , the sun will be darkened , and the moon will not give its light , Mark 13:25 and the stars will be falling from heaven , and the powers in the heavens will be shaken . Mark 13:26 And then they will see the Son of man coming in clouds with great power and glory . My understanding of Jesus ' answer is that , unlike his first coming , which was veiled , the second coming will be quite unmistakeable . He's telling us not to be misled by the other things that have to happen before his second coming -- the actual second coming will make his power openly visible . By the way , from Koresh 's public statement it 's not so clear to me that he is claiming to be Christ . -- clh ]

He's got Lankford at third with Todd Zeile I believe - a hot hitter - coming up - there 's no reason to risk giving Lankford the go sign in that situation unless he was sure the ball is going to the stands . It 's his job to watch the play develop - he should have known Larkin was there to back up a bad throw . That seemed inexcusable in my book .

Remove the Hard Disk by disconnecting the power and SCSI cables , spreading the tabs , and lifting the drive out . 3 . Remove the flopy drive . 4 . Remove the power supply by spreading the tab in front and lifting the supply straight up and out . 5 . Remove the fan by pressing the ears together at the back , bottom side of the fan and lifting straight up and out . 6 . Remove the Mother Board by spreading the tabs on the left and right side of the board and sliding the board forward then lifting the board out . ( all connectors on the back of the board must be removed first ) 7 . Desolder the 40MHz clock ( the one closest to the memory modules ) . This is not easy even for a skilled solderer . 8 . Get an IC socket with the round pins and remove four of the pins by pushing them up from the bottom with long nose pliers . 9 . Put the four pins in the holes vacated by the clock and solder them in . 10.Insert a 50MHz or 64MHz clock . 11.Put large power transistor heat sink 's on the processor chip and the other large chip just to the right of the processor and figure some way to hold the heat sync 's in place . I made a simple clamp by putting a four inch screw up through the hole in the board between the two chips . Mount the screw using insulated washers . Screw a cross member down over the heat sync 's to hold them in place . Do n't use too much pressure . 12 . Put it all back together and go-for-it .

The Bill of Rights , as far as I can see , does not once refer to `` citizens '' , but it makes several references to `` people '' . For example , Article IV : '' The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated '' ; Article V : `` no person shall be held to answer for a capital , or otherwise infamous crime , unless on a presentment or indictment by a Grand Jury ... nor shall any person ... be deprived of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law '' ; Article VIII : `` excessive bail shall not be required , nor excessive fines imposed , nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted '' . Now I 've never heard that Constitutional rights apply only to citizens ; are n't they meant to apply equally to all *persons* living in the U.S. ? Whether slaves were considered `` not human '' I do n't know , but it seems that a case could be made that they were n't treated as `` people '' as defined in the Bill of Rights . And since the nation is nominally based on the Declaration of Independence which states that `` all Men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights , that among these are Life , Liberty , and the Pursuit of Happiness '' , it would also seem that slaves would not follow under this definition of humanity . -- -- - Eric Smith erics @ netcom.com erics @ infoserv.com CI $ : 70262,3610

All of which require something we Christians readily admit to : `` Faith '' . The fact that there are several candidates belies that *none* are conclusive . With out conclusive evidence , we are left with faith . It could even be argued that one of these hypotheses may one day be proven ( as best as a non-repeatable event can be `` proven '' ) . But I ask , what holds someone *today* to the belief that any or all of them are correct , except by faith ? [ a couple of paragraphs deleted .

Actually , both questions turn out to be = devoid of meaning . Things that exist do , and things that do n't exist = do n't exist . Tautology at its best .

It does n't address why something does or does not exist , but asks to define the lack of existence . The second question is unanswerable indeed , for how do we identify something as `` nothing '' ( are n't they mutually exclusive terms ) ? . How do we identify a state of non-existence ( again , this is nearing the limits of this simple layman 's ability to comprehend , and I would appreciate an explanation ) . I might add , the worldview of `` Things that exist do , and things that do n't ... do n't '' is as grounded in the realm of the non-falsifiable , as does the theist 's belief in God . It is based on the assumption that there is *not* a reason for being , something as ultimately ( un ) supportable as the position of there being a reason . Its very foundation exists in the same soil as that of one who claims there *is* a reason . We come to this . Either `` I am , therefore I am . `` , or `` I am for a reason .

It would lead me to question their definition of Christianity as well . = Another answer is that God is the _source_ of all existence . = This sounds much better , but I am tempted to ask : Does God = Himself exist , then ? If God is the source of His own existence , = it can only mean that He has , in terms of human time , always = existed . But this is not the same as the source of all existence . This does not preclude His existence . It only seeks to identify His *qualities* ( implying He exists to *have* qualities , BTW ) . = The best answer I have heard is that human reasoning is incapable = of understanding such questions . Being an atheist myself , I do not = accept such answers , since I do not have any other methods . Like the theist , we come to a statement of faith , for this position assumes that the evidence at hand is conclusive . Note , I am not arguing against scientific endeavor , for science is useful for understanding the universe in which we exist . But I differ from the atheist in a matter of perspective . I seek to understand what exists to understand and appreciate the art of the Creator . I also have discovered science is an inadequate tool to answer `` why '' . It appears that M. Pihko agrees ( as we shall see ) . But because a tool is inadequate to answer a question does not preclude the question . Asserting that 'why ' is an invalid question does not provide an answer . = : As far as I can tell , the very laws of nature demand a `` why '' . That isn't = : true of something outside of nature ( i.e. , *super*natural ) . = = This is not true . Science is a collection of models telling us `` how '' , = not why , something happens .

If supernatural beings exist , it is = as appropriate to ask why they do so as it is to ask why we exist . My apologies . I was using why as `` why did this come to be '' . Why did pre-existence become existence . Why did pre-spacetime become spacetime . But we come to the admission that science fails to answer `` Why ? '' . Because it ca n't be answered in the realm of modern science , does that make the question invalid ? = : I do n't believe *any* = : technology would be able to produce that necessary *spark* of life , despite = : having all of the parts available .

I suppose we would do the same thing as when Galileo or Capernicus was *vindicated* ( before someone starts jumping up and down screaming '' Inquisition ! `` , note I said *vindicated* . I certainly hope we 've gotten beyond the `` shooting the messenger '' stage ) . M. Pihko does present a good point though . We may need to ask `` What do I as an individual Christian base my faith on ? '' Will it be shaken by the production of evidence that shatters our `` sacred cows '' or will we seek to understand if a new discovery truly disagrees with what God *said* ( and continues to say ) in his Word ? `` Why do I ask why ?

( He said he will replace the components before selling the car to me . ) Being copmletely ignorant to the technical stuff on cars , I do n't know what this could mean ... Is 96K km about the time typical for replacing the above mentioned items ? Or is this an indication that the car was abused ? Would other things break down or have to be replaced soon ? The seller told me that he used the car on the highway a lot , but , I do n't know how to verify this ... I 've seen the paint chipped away in tiny dots in the front edge of the hood , though . Although the Maxima is an excellent car and the car is very clean and well kept , it 's currently out of warranty ( a similarly priced '90 Accord with 70K km will have 2 years or 30K km worth of warranty left ) and I do n't want to worry about paying for any repair bills ...

It is a bit lengthy for a posting , but I thought I 'd share it with all of you anyway . Feel free to pass it along to anyone whom you feel might benefit from what it says . May God richly bless those who read it . ======================================================================= D O E S G O D L O V E Y O U ? Q . What kind of question is that ? Anyone who can read sees signs , tracts , books , and bumper stickers that say , `` God Loves You . '' Isn't that true ? A . It is true that God offers His love to the whole world , as we read in one of the most quoted verses in the Bible : For God so loved the world , that he gave his only begotten Son , that whosoever believeth in him should not perish , but have everlasting life . John 3:16 However , God 's love is qualified . The Bible says : The way of the wicked is an abomination unto the LORD : but he loveth him that followeth after righteousness . Proverbs 15:9 For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous : but the way of the ungodly shall perish . Psalm 1:6 Q . But I am not wicked . I am a decent , moral person . Surely the good I have done in my life far outweighs whatever bad I have done . How can these verses apply to me ? A . By God 's standard of righteousness even the most moral person is looked upon by God as a desperate sinner on his way to Hell . The Bible teaches that no one is good enough in himself to go to Heaven . On the contrary , we are all sinners and we are all guilty before God . As it is written , There is none righteous , no , not one : There is none that understandeth , there is none that seeketh after God . Romans 3:10-11 The heart is deceitful above all things , and desperately wicked : who can know it ? Jeremiah 17:9 Q . If I am such a wicked person in God 's sight , what will God do to me ? A . The Bible teaches that at the end of the world all the wicked will come under eternal punishment in a place called Hell . For a fire is kindled in mine anger , and shall burn unto the lowest hell , and shall consume the earth with her increase , and set on fire the foundations of the mountains . I will heap mischiefs upon them ; I will spend mine arrows upon them . They shall be burnt with hunger , and devoured with burning heat , and with bitter destruction : I will also send the teeth of beasts upon them , with the poison of serpents of the dust . Deuteronomy 32:22-24 Q. Oh , come on now ! Hell is not real , is it ? Surely things are not that bad . A . Indeed , Hell is very real , and things are that bad for the individ- ual who does not know the Lord Jesus Christ as Savior . The Bible makes many references to Hell , indicating that it is both eternal and consists of perpetual suffering . And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire . Revelation 20:15 So shall it be at the end of the world : the angels shall come forth , and sever the wicked from among the just , And shall cast them into the furnace of fire : there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth . Matthew 13:49-50 ... when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels , In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God , and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ : Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord , and from the glory of his power ; 2 Thessalonians 1:7-9 Q . That is terrible ! Why would God create a Hell ? A . Hell is terrible , and it exists because God created man to be accountable to God for his actions . God 's perfect justice demands payment for sin . For the wages of sin is death ; Romans 6:23 For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ ; that every one may receive the things done in his body , according to that he hath done , whether it be good or bad . 2 Corinthians 5:10 But I say unto you , That every idle word that men shall speak , they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment . Matthew 12:36 Q . Does that mean that at the end of the world everyone will be brought to life again to be judged and then to be sent to Hell ? A . Indeed it does ; that is , unless we can find someone to be our substitute in bearing the punishment of eternal damnation for our sins . That someone is God Himself , who came to earth as Jesus Christ to bear the wrath of God for all who believe in Him . All we like sheep have gone astray ; we have turned every one to his own way ; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all . Isaiah 53:6 But he was wounded for our transgressions , he was bruised for our iniquities : the chastisement of our peace was upon him ; and with his stripes we are healed . Isaiah 53:5 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received , how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures ; And that he was buried , and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures : 1 Corinthians 15:3-4 For he hath made him to be sin for us , who knew no sin ; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him . 2 Corinthians 5:21 Q . Are you saying that if I trust in Christ as my substitute , Who was already punished for my sins , then I will not have to worry about Hell anymore ? A . Yes , this is so ! If I have believed in Christ as my Savior , then it is as if I have already stood before the Judgment Throne of God . Christ as my substitute has already paid for my sins . He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life : and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life ; but the wrath of God abideth on him . John 3:36 Q . But what does it mean to believe on Him ? If I agree with all that the Bible says about Christ as Savior , then am I saved from going to Hell ? A . Believing on Christ means a whole lot more than agreeing in our minds with the truths of the Bible . It means that we hang our whole lives on Him . It means that we entrust every part of our lives to the truths of the Bible . It means that we turn away from our sins and serve Christ as our Lord . No man can serve two masters : for either he will hate the one , and love the other ; or else he will hold to the one , and despise the other . Ye can not serve God and mammon . Matthew 6:24 Repent ye therefore , and be converted , that your sins may be blotted out , when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord ; Acts 3:19 Q . Are you saying that there is no other way to escape Hell except through Jesus ? What about all the other religions ? Will their followers also go to Hell ? A . Yes , indeed . They can not escape the fact that God holds us account- able for our sins . God demands that we pay for our sins . Other religions can not provide a substitute to bear the sins of their followers . Christ is the only one who is able to bear our guilt and save us . Neither is there salvation in any other : for there is none other name under heaven given among men , whereby we must be saved . Acts 4:12 Jesus said : I am the way , the truth , and the life : no man cometh unto the Father , but by me . John 14:6 If we confess our sins , he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins , and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness . 1 John 1:9 Q . Now I am desperate . I do not want to go to Hell . What can I do ? A . You must remember that God is the only one who can help you . You must throw yourself altogether on the mercies of God . As you see your hopeless condition as a sinner , cry out to God to save you . And the publican , standing afar off , would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven , but smote upon his breast , saying , God be merciful to me a sinner . Luke 18:13 ... Sirs , what must I do to be saved ? And they said , Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ , and thou shalt be saved , ... Acts 16:30-31 Q . But how can I believe on Christ if I know so little about Him ? A . Wonderfully , God not only saves us through the Lord Jesus , but He also gives us the faith to believe on Him . You can pray to God that He will give you faith in Jesus Christ as your Savior . For by grace are ye saved through faith ; and that not of yourselves : it is the gift of God : Ephesians 2:8 God works particularly through the Bible to give us that faith . So , if you really mean business with God about your salvation , you should use every opportunity to hear and study the Bible , which is the only Word of God . In this brochure , all verses from the Bible are within indented paragraphs . Give heed to them with all your heart . So then faith cometh by hearing , and hearing by the word of God . Romans 10:17 Q . But does this mean that I have to surrender everything to God ? A . Yes . God wants us to come to Him in total humility , acknowledging our sinfulness and our helplessness , trusting totally in Him . The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit : a broken and a contrite heart , O God , thou wilt not despise . Psalm 51:17 Because we are sinners we love our sins . Therefore , we must begin to pray to God for an intense hatred of our sins . And if we sincerely desire salvation , we will also begin to turn from our sins as God strengthens us . We know that our sins are sending us to Hell . Unto you first God , having raised up his Son Jesus , sent him to bless you , in turning away every one of you from his iniquities . Acts 3:26 Q . Does n't the Bible teach that I must attend church regularly and be baptized ? Will these save me ? A . If possible , we should do these things , but they will not save us . No work of any kind can secure our salvation . Salvation is God's sovereign gift of grace given according to His mercy and good pleas- ure . Salvation is Not of works , lest any man should boast . Ephesians 2:9 Q . What else will happen at the end of the world ? A . Those who have trusted in Jesus as their Savior will be transformed into their glorious eternal bodies and will be with Christ forever- more . For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout , with the voice of the archangel , and with the trump of God : and the dead in Christ shall rise first : Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds , to meet the Lord in the air : and so shall we ever be with the Lord . 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 Q . What will happen to the earth at that time ? A . God will destroy the entire universe by fire and create new heavens and a new earth where Christ will reign with His believers forever- more . But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night ; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise , and the elements shall melt with fervent heat , the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up . ... Nevertheless we , according to his promise , look for new heavens and a new earth , wherein dwelleth righteousness . 2 Peter 3:10,13 Q . Does the Bible give us any idea of when the end of the earth will come ? A . Yes ! The end will come when Christ has saved all whom He plans to save . And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations ; and then shall the end come . Matthew 24:14 Q . Can we know how close to the end of the world we might be ? A . Yes ! God gives much information in the Bible concerning the timing of the history of the world and tells us that while the Day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night for the unsaved , it will not come as a thief for the believers . There is much evidence in the Bible that the end of the world and the return of Christ may be very , very close . * All the time clues in the Bible point to this . For when they shall say , Peace and safety ; then sudden destruction cometh upon them , as travail upon a woman with child ; and they shall not escape . 1 Thessalonians 5:3 Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing , but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets . Amos 3:7 Q . But that means Judgment Day is almost here . A . Yes , it does . God warned ancient Nineveh that He was going to destroy that great city and He gave them forty days warning . And Jonah began to enter into the city a day 's journey , and he cried , and said , Yet forty days , and Nineveh shall be overthrown . Jonah 3:4 Q . What did the people of Nineveh do ? A . From the king on down they humbled themselves before God , repented of their sins , and cried to God for mercy . But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth , and cry mightily unto God : yea , let them turn every one from his evil way , and from the violence that is in their hands . Who can tell if God will turn and repent , and turn away from his fierce anger , that we perish not ? Jonah 3:8-9 Q . Did God hear their prayers ? A . Yes . God saved a great many people of Nineveh . Q . Can I still cry to God for mercy so that I will not come into judg- ment ? A . Yes . There is still time to become saved even though that time has become very short . How shall we escape , if we neglect so great salvation ; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord , and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him ; Hebrews 2:3 In God is my salvation and my glory : the rock of my strength , and my refuge , is in God . Trust in him at all times ; ye people , pour out your heart before him : God is a refuge for us . Psalm 62:7-8 A R E Y O U R E A D Y T O M E E T G O D ?

The only change to the text itself is the paragraph which describes the way in which Biblical passages appear within the text . In the original tract they appear in italic lettering ; they appear here as indented paragraphs . I have read Mr . Camping 's book , compared it with what the Bible actual- ly says , find it to be the most credible research with respect to what the future holds that I have ever come across , and agree with him that there is just too much data to ignore . While none of us is guaranteed one more second of life , and while we , therefore , should take these matters very seriously regardless of when Christ will actually return , it would appear that our natural tendency to postpone caring about our eternal destiny until we feel that our death is imminent is even more senseless now because , in all likelihood , the law of averages with respect to life expectancy no longer applies .

Even with heterosexuals we tend to leave some hanging in the sense of knowledge and information about sexuality and relationships . It is very difficult for a young person to develop and build a positive view of themself when they are constantly being told implicitly and explicitly that they are wrong and immoral . The concepts about personal relationships are deeply embedded in emotionalism and fear- these fears cover a wide range , but mostly jealousy and lack of trust seem to be cornerstones of modern day American relationships . We also set on top of this the concepts of Madison Avenue attractiveness and standards and put the pressure on to measure up .

The term god is used in a different way usually . When you use a different definition it is your thing , but until it is commonly accepted you would have to say the way I define god is ... and that does not exist , it is existence itself , so I say it does not exist . Interestingly , there are those who say that `` existence exists '' is one of the indubitable statements possible . Further , saying god is existence is either a waste of time , existence is already used and there is no need to replace it by god , or you are implying more with it , in which case your definition and your argument so far are incomplete , making it a fallacy .

From : bfinnert @ chaph.usc.edu ( Brian Finnerty ) Subject : Mary 's assumption Organization : University of Southern California , Los Angeles , CA Lines : 34 A few points about Mary 's being taken into heaven at the end of her life on earth : One piece of evidence for Mary 's assumption into heaven is the fact that no Christian church ever claimed to be the sight where she was buried . Some Christian churches claimed to be located at the final resting places of Peter , Mark , and other saints , but no one ever claimed to possess the body of Mary , the greatest of the saints . Why ? Because everyone knew that she had been taken up into heaven . Although there is no definitive scriptural proof for the assumption of Mary , some passages seem suggestive , like the passage in Revelation that describes a woman giving birth to a Son and later being crowned in the heavens . Of course , the woman in this passage has other interpretations ; she can also be taken a symbol for the Church . The assumption of Mary makes sense because of her relationship to Christ . Jesus , perfect God and perfect man , fulfilled the requirements of the law perfectly . Under the law God gave to us , we are to honor our mother and father , and Christ 's act of taking his mother into heaven is part of his fulfillment of that law . Also , he took his flesh from her , so it seems appropriate that he decide not to allow her flesh to rot in the grave . One last point : an ex-Catholic attempted to explain Catholic doctrine on the assumption by asserting it is connected to a belief that Mary did not die . This is not a correct summary of what Catholics believe . The dogma of the assumption was carefully phrased to avoid saying whether Mary did or did not die . In fact , the consensus among Catholic theologians seems to be that Mary in fact did die . This would make sense : Christ died , and his Mother , who waited at the foot of the cross , would want to share in his death . Brian Finnerty

From : atterlep @ vela.acs.oakland.edu ( Cardinal Ximenez ) Subject : Atheists and Hell Organization : National Association for the Disorganized Lines : 26 Hello , I have seen two common threads running through postings by atheists on the newsgroup , and I think that they can be used to explain each other . Unfortunately I do n't have direct quotes handy ... 1 ) Atheists believe that when they die , they die forever . 2 ) A god who would condemn those who fail to believe in him to eternal death is unfair . I do n't see what the problem is ! To Christians , Hell is , by definition , eternal death -- exactly what atheists are expecting when they die . There 's no reason Hell has to be especially awful -- to most people , eternal death is bad enough . Literal interpreters of the Bible will have a problem with this view , since the Bible talks about the fires of Hell and such . Personally , I do n't think that people in Hell will be thrust into flame any more than I expect to Jesus with a double-edged sword issuing from his mouth -- I treat both these statements as metaphorical .

From : JJMARVIN @ pucc.princeton.edu Subject : prayers and advice requested on family problem Organization : Princeton University Lines : 70 My brother has been alienated from my parents and me since shortly after his marriage to a domineering and insecure woman , about twelve years ago . We 've kept things on a painfully polite , Christmas-card sort of level for most of this time . Attempts to see each other end disastrously , with his wife throwing a screaming fit and storming out over either our imagined slights to her , or his inattention or insensitivity to her ( I mean , this'll happen by the end of a single restaurant meal ) . He seems , from what I've seen , to live in a state of quivering anxiety , hoping futilely to keep the next storm from breaking . He has sacrificed not only meaningful contact with us but also other friends and outside interests . Now , this is his choice , and I need to accept it even if I deplore it . But it 's hard . From time to time I 've wanted to drop the pretense that we have a relationship -- by cutting off contact -- or trying to have a real if painful relationship , by talking honestly with him , but I 've always thought , `` Why be dramatic ? And you know he 'll only get evasive and then find some excuse to get off the phone . Just leave the door open , in case he ever decides to come back . '' It 's been an unsatisfying choice , to allow us to go on with the superficial trappings of a relationship , but it was the best I could think of . Now , this weekend , my mother finally decided that she was n't going to pretend any more and has cut off relations with them . This was the outcome of a phone conversation in which my sister-in-law screamed and raved at my mother , blaming her for everything wrong in their lives , and in which my brother evaded , temporized , claimed the situation was beyond his control , and as always expected my mother to make all the allowances and concessions . Mom said she would not , that she would not quietly take abuse any more , and that if these were the terms of their relationship , she did n't want to talk to or see them any more . And she hung up . ( I have never seem my mother lose her temper , and I think that this is the first time she 's ever hung up on someone . ) Mom says she feels as if she 's divorced my brother , and that it 's a relief in some ways to have the break out in the open and done with . I have mixed feelings . I 'm proud of Mom for sticking up for herself ; angry at my brother and sister-in-law for hurting her , for being jerks , for persisting in such a wretched life , which hurts us all and is warping their children ; angry at my sister-in-law for being so hateful , and angry at my brother for being a coward and having so little respect for himself or us that he 's willing to throw us aside and use up all his energy trying to appease an unappeasable , emotionally disturbed woman ; pained for their children , who are a mess ; scared for the future , since this marks the time when either things will change and improve or the break will become irrevocable ; nastily self- righteous over this bit of proof that they ca n't `` get away '' with treating us or each other this way , and then disgusted with myself for even beginning to gloat over others ' misery ; and finally , mostly , sad , sad , sad , to see my parents hurt and my brother and sister-in-law trapped in a horrible , destructive situation that they ca n't see a way out of -- or they ca n't bear to take whatever paths they do see . And I 'm frustrated because I do n't know what if anything to do , and doing nothing drives me up the wall . I try to pray , about my own feelings of rage , impotence , and vindictiveness , and about their situation , but I am not free of the desire to *DO* something concrete . ( The desire to *DO* something , to define a problem and fix it , is one of my besetting vices ; I 'm having a terrible time quieting down my internal mental chatter enough to listen for God . ) Do you thoughtful and kind people on the net have advice for me ? Is this a time to reach out to my brother ? To let things be ? How can I conquer my rage AT him enough to be there FOR him ? Here 's the big question I 've been evading throughout this long , long post : Is it ok , as a Christian and a proponent of faith , hope , and charity , to accept the destruction of a relationship ? To give up on my own brother , or at least to accept that I am powerless to help him and can only wait and see what happens ? Do please answer -- by e-mail or post . Thank you .

I post it , along with the other FAQ stuff . If you have questions , you want to send mail to Richard , not me . -- Dan Software Tools to help with RSI -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - This file describes tools , primarily software , to help prevent or manage RSI . This version now includes information on such diverse tools as calendar programs and digital watches ... Please let me know if you know any other tools , or if you have information or opinions on these ones , and I will update this FAQ . I am especially interested in getting reviews of these products from people who have evaluated them or are using them . Richard Donkin Internet mail : richardd @ hoskyns.co.uk Tel : +44 71 814 5708 ( direct ) Fax : +44 71 251 2853 Changes in this version : Added information on StressFree , another typing management tool for Windows . TYPING MANAGEMENT TOOLS : these aim to help you manage your keyboard use , by warning you to take a break every so often . The better ones also include advice on exercises , posture and workstation setup . Some use sound hardware to warn of a break , others use beeps or screen messages . Often , RSI appears only after many years of typing , and the pain has a delayed action in the short term too : frequently you can be typing all day with little problem and the pain gets worse in the evening . These tools act as an early warning system : by listening to their warnings and taking breaks with exercises , you do n't have to wait for your body to give you a more serious and painful warning - that is , getting RSI . Tool : At Your Service ( commercial software ) Available from : Bright Star Tel : +1 ( 206 ) 451 3697 Platforms : Mac ( System 6.0.4 ) , Windows Description : Provides calendar , keyboard watch , email watch , and system info . Warns when to take a break ( configurable ) . Has a few recommendations on posture , and exercises . Sound-oriented , will probably work best with sound card ( PC ) or with microphone ( Mac ) . Should be possible to record your own messages to warn of break . Tool : AudioPort ( sound card and software ) Available from : Media Vision Tel : +1 ( 510 ) 226 2563 Platforms : PC Description : A sound card to plug into your PC parallel port . Includes 'At Your Service ' . Tool : Computer Health Break ( commercial software ) Available from : Escape Ergonomics , Inc 1111 W. El Camino Real Suite 109 Mailstop 403 Sunnyvale , CA Tel : +1 ( 408 ) 730 8410 Platforms : DOS Description : Aimed at preventing RSI , this program warns you to take breaks after a configurable interval , based on clock time , or after a set number of keystrokes -- whichever is earlier . It gives you 3 exercises to do each time , randomly selected from a set of 70 . Exercises are apparently tuned to the type of work you do - data entry , word processing , information processing . Exercises are illustrated and include quite a lot of text on how to do the exercise and on what exactly the exercise does . CHB includes hypertext information on RSI that you can use to learn more about RSI and how to prevent it . Other information on non-RSI topics can be plugged into this hypertext viewer . A full glossary of medical terms and jargon is included . CHB can be run in a DOS box under Windows , but does not then warn you when to take a break ; it does not therefore appear useful when used with Windows . Cost : $ 79.95 ; quantity discounts , site licenses . Comments : The keystroke-counting approach looks good : it seems better to measure the activity that is causing you problems than to measure clock time or even typing time . The marketing stuff is very good and includes some summaries of research papers , as well as lots of arguments you can use to get your company to pay up for RSI management tools . Tool : EyerCise ( commercial software ) Available from : RAN Enterprises One Woodland Park Dr. Haverhill , MA 01830 , US Tel : 800-451-4487 ( US only ) Platforms : Windows ( 3.0/3.1 ) , OS/2 PM ( 1.3/2.0 ) [ Not DOS ] Description : Aimed at preventing RSI and eye strain , this program warns you to take breaks after a configurable interval ( or at fixed times ) . Optionally displays descriptions and pictures of exercises - pictures are animated and program beeps you to help you do exercises at the correct rate . Includes 19 stretches and 4 visual training exercises , can configure which are included and how many repetitions you do - breaks last from 3 to 7 minutes . Also includes online help on workplace ergonomics . Quote from their literature : '' EyerCise is a Windows program that breaks up your day with periodic sets of stretches and visual training exercises . The stretches work all parts of your body , relieving tension and helping to prevent Repetitive Strain Injury . The visual training exercises will improve your peripheral vision and help to relieve eye strain . Together these help you to become more relaxed and productive . '' `` The package includes the book _Computers & Visual Stress_ by Edward C. Godnig , O.D . and John S. Hacunda , which describes the ergonomic setup for a computer workstation and provides procedures and exercises to promote healthy and efficient computer use . Cost : $ 69.95 including shipping and handling , quantity discounts for resellers . Free demo ( $ 5 outside US ) . Comments : I have a copy of this , and it works as advertised : I would say it is better for RSI prevention than RSI management , because it does not allow breaks at periods less than 30 minutes . Also , it interrupts you based on clock time rather than typing time , which is not so helpful unless you use the keyboard all day . Worked OK on Windows 3.0 though it did occasionally crash with a UAE - not sure why . Also refused to work with the space bar on one PC , and has one window without window controls . Very usable though , and does not require any sound hardware . Tool : Lifeguard ( commercial software ) Available from : Visionary Software P.O . Box 69447 Portland , OR 97201 , US Tel : +1 ( 503 ) 246-6200 Platforms : Mac , DOS ( Windows version underway ) Description : Aimed at preventing RSI . Warns you to take a break with dialog box and sound . Includes a list of exercises to do during breaks , and information on configuring your workstation in an ergonomic manner . Price : $ 59 ; quantity discounts and site licenses . The DOS product is bought in from another company , apparently ; not sure how equivalent this is to the Mac version . The Mac version got a good review in Desktop Publisher Magazine ( Feb 1991 ) . Good marketing stuff with useful 2-page summaries of RSI problems and solutions , with references . Tool : StressFree ( commercial software , free usable demo ) Available from : LifeTime Software P.O .

Anon FTP : ftp.cica.indiana.edu ( and mirroring sites ) Platforms : Windows ( 3.0/3.1 ) ( Mac and DOS versions underway ) Description : Aimed at preventing RSI , this program warns you to take breaks after a configurable interval ( or at fixed times ) . Displays descriptions and pictures of exercises - pictures are animated and program paces you to help you do exercises at the correct rate . Quite a few exercises , can configure which ones are included to some extent . Online help . Version 2.0 is out soon , Mac and DOS versions will be based on this . Cost : $ 29.95 if support via CompuServe or Internet , otherwise $ 39.95 . Site license for 3 or more copies is $ 20.00 each . ( NOTE : prices may have gone up for V2.0 ) . Comments : I have had a play with this , and it works OK. Its user interface design is much better in 2.0 , though still a bit unusual . expensive tool around and it does the job . It is also the only tool with a redistributable demo , so if you do get the demo , post it on your local bulletin boards , FTP servers and Bitnet servers ! Does not include general info on RSI and ergonomics , but it does have the ability to step backward in the exercise sequence , which is good for repeating the most helpful exercises . Tool : Typewatch ( freeware ) , version 3.8 ( October 1992 ) Available from : Email to richardd @ hoskyns.co.uk Anonymous ftp : soda.berkeley.edu : pub/typing-injury/typewatch.shar Platforms : UNIX ( tested on SCO , SunOS , Mach ; character and X Window mode ) Description : This is a shell script that runs in the background and warns you to stop typing , based on how long you have been continuously typing . It does not provide exercises , but it does check that you really do take a break , and tells you when you can start typing again . Typewatch now tells you how many minutes you have been typing today , each time it warns you , which is useful so you know how much you *really* type . It also logs information to a file that you can analyse or simply print out . The warning message appears on your screen ( in character mode ) , in a pop-up window ( for X Windows ) , or as a Zephyr message ( for those with Athena stuff ) . Tim Freeman < tsf @ cs.cmu.edu > has put in a lot of bug fixes , extra features and support for X , Zephyr and Mach . Not formally supported , but email richardd @ hoskyns.co.uk ( for SCO , SunOS , character mode ) or tsf @ cs.cmu.edu ( for Mach , X Window mode , Zephyr ) if you have problems or want to give feedback . Tool : Various calendar / batch queue programs Available from : Various sources Platforms : Various Description : Any calendar/reminder program that warns you of an upcoming appointment can be turned into an ad hoc RSI management tool . Or , any batch queue submission program that lets you submit a program to run at a specific time to display a message to the screen . Using Windows as an example : create a Calendar file , and include this filename in your WIN.INI 's 'load= ' line so you get it on every startup of Windows . Suppose you want to have breaks every 30 minutes , starting from 9 am . Press F7 ( Special Time ... ) to enter an appointment , enter 9:30 , hit Enter , and type some text in saying what the break is for . Then press F5 to set an alarm on this entry , and repeat for the next appointment . By using Windows Recorder , you can record the keystrokes that set up breaks throughout a day in a .REC file . Put this file on your 'run= ' line , as above , and you will then , with a single keypress , be able to set up your daily appointments with RSI exercises . The above method should be adaptable to most calendar programs . An example using batch jobs would be to submit a simple job that runs at 9:30 am and warns you to take a break ; this will depend a lot on your operating system . While these approaches are not ideal , they are a good way of forcing yourself to take a break if you ca n't get hold of a suitable RSI management tool . If you are techie enough you might want to write a version of Typewatch ( see above ) for your operating system , using batch jobs or whatever fits best . Tool : Digital watches with count-down timers Available from : Various sources , e.g . Casio BP-100 . Description : Many digital watches have timers that count down from a settable number of minutes ; they usually reset easily to that number , either manually or automatically . While these are a very basic tool , they are very useful if you are writing , reading , driving , or doing anything away from a computer which can still cause or aggravate RSI . The great advantage is that they remind you to break from whatever you are doing . Comments : My own experience was that cutting down a lot on my typing led to my writing a lot more , and still reading as much as ever , which actually aggravated the RSI in my right arm though the left arm improved . Getting a count-down timer watch has been very useful on some occasions where I write a lot in a day . I have tried an old fashioned hour-glass type egg timer , but these are not much good because they do not give an audible warning of the end of the time period ! KEYBOARD REMAPPING TOOLS : these enable you to change your keyboard mapping so you can type one-handedly or with a different two-handed layout . One-handed typing tools may help , but be VERY careful about how you use them -- if you keep the same overall typing workload you are simply doubling your hand use for the hand that you use for typing , and may therefore make matters worse . Tool : hsh ( public domain ) Available from : Anonymous ftp : soda.berkeley.edu : pub/typing-injury/hsh.shar Platforms : UNIX ( do n't know which ones ) Description : Allows one-handed typing and other general keyboard remappings . Only works through tty 's ( so , you can use it with a terminal or an xterm , but not most X programs ) . Tool : Dvorak keyboard tools ( various ) Available from : Anonymous ftp : soda.berkeley.edu : pub/typing-injury/xdvorak.c Also built into Windows 3.x . Description : The Dvorak keyboard apparently uses a more rational layout that involves more balanced hand use . It *may* help prevent RSI a bit , but you can also use it if you have RSI , since it will slow down your typing a *lot* : - ) -- Dan Wallach `` One of the most attractive features of a Connection dwallach @ cs.berkeley.edu Machine is the array of blinking lights on the faces Office # : 510-642-9585 of its cabinet .

But what about second sources for pin-compatible non-Clipper algorithm chips that also have escrowed keys ? If a `` reputable firm '' produces a chip ( with escrowed key ) that is a pop-in replacement for the Clipper chip in my phone , and uses an algorithm that is widely known and evaluated and `` trusted , '' then what 's the problem ? The Clipper is going to be reverse engineered anyway by any organization with sufficient resources ( can you say `` billions of cocaine dollars ? '' ) so those drug dealers they 're so worried about will be slipping through the cracks . We law-abiding ( non-incredibly-wealthy ) citizens , naturally , will not have this recourse . But claiming that the algorithm ca n't be released to prevent people from using non-key-escrowed chips is plain deceitful ... analysis of the chip output will provide information on the necessary headers and whatnot , so the `` bad guys '' could build chips using a *different* algorithm and still not escrow their keys . Or , they could just buy bunches of cheap phones at K-mart every week , and play Swap-the-Clipper-Chip with their cellular phone every day . Michael T.

Anyone out there know ? Every aircraft has flight constraints for speed/AOA/power . When graphed , these define the 'flight envelope ' of that aircraft , presumably so named because the graphed line encloses ( envelopes ) the area on the graph that represents conditions where the aircraft does n't fall out of the sky . Hence , 'pushing the envelope ' becomes 'operating at ( or beyond ) the edge of the flight ( or operational ) envelope ' . Note that the envelope is n't precisely known until someone actually flies the airplane in those regions -- up to that point , all there are are the theoretical predictions . Hence , one of the things test pilots do for a living is 'push the envelope ' to find out how close the correspondence between the paper airplane and the metal one is -- in essence , 'pushing back ' the edges of the theoretical envelope to where the airplane actually starts to fail to fly . Note , too , that this is done is a quite calculated and careful way ; flight tests are generally carefully coreographed and just what is going to be 'pushed ' and how far is precisely planned ( despite occasional deviations from plans , such as the 'early ' first flight of the F-16 during its high-speed taxi tests ) .

From : alastair @ farli.otago.ac.nz ( Alastair Thomson ) Subject : Does 'Just/justifiable War ' exist ? Organization : University of Otago Lines : 107 Hi there netters , I have a question I would very much like to see some discussion on : Is there such a thing as a 'justifible ' war ? What I would love to see it some basis from scripture for either : `` All war is wrong '' , or `` Some war is justifiable '' . To get things started I would like to outline why I am asking the question . In my high school days I had been quite involved in the the New Zealand Cadet Forces ( This is a bit like ROTC from what I understand of it , but with a lot more emphasis on fun than military career training ) . Through this I became extremely enamoured of flying , have become involved in the sport of gliding , and have a great interest in military aviation hardware as the very best a 'real ' flyer could ask for . My favourite computer games are the accurate simulations of military aircraft , both past and present . I became a Christian about 10 years ago , and at the time rejected all military activity as immoral . For me , all war was in complete opposition to God 's commandments to love one another , especially one 's enemies . During the war in Iraq , I found myself with great excitement listening to the reports of the effectiveness of the the attacks using the aviation technology I so admire - The F117A 'Stealh ' bomber , the F14 , F15 and F16 strike aircraft , etc . After the war concluded I began to really enjoy simulations based around this conflict - Great to go and bomb Saddam 's bio-weapons plants in an F117A on my computer , or shoot down some of his Mig 's in an F16 . The simulation of the death of people was a wonderful game . I imagine the real pilots view the real thing in much the same way . One only has to look at the language used to see that the personal impact of war is ignored : A building containing people , or an aircraft flown by a pilot is simply a 'target ' . Dead civilians are 'collateral damage ' . These euphanisms are a way of removing the reality of war from the people whose support are necessary for the continued waging of war - One only has to look at Vietnam to see how important public opinion is . Now we see troops sponsored by the United Nations entering Somalia , and the prospect of military intervention in the Muslim/Croat/Serb conflict in the former Yugoslavia . My revulsion in particular to the siege of Sarajevo , and in the last few days of ( sorry 'bout spelling ) Sebrenitsa , has caused me to rethink where I stand on 'justifiable ' war . I will list several wars in the last 50 years I can look at each , and say - Yes this may have been justifible , this may not . These are simply my gut reactions to each - In many cases with the benefit of the impartiality history brings . Let me go through a few and state some of my reasons for my reaction - I am not a historian , so excuse any historical blunders , I am working from popular history as it is known in New Zealand . 1 . The Second World War - Murder of Jews - Hitler had to be stopped . - Massive civilian casualties on both sides - Dresden , Hiroshima/Nagasaki - Probably justifiable . 2 . Korean war - Political expansionism by North Korea , basically communism vs. capitalism . - Probably not justifiable . 3 . Vietnam - As above , worsened by US involvement . 4 . Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia . - Genocide by Khmer Rouge . - Probably justifiable . 5 . Iraq ( Desert Storm ) - Political expansionism , threat to world oil supply - Other factors such as genocide . - Not sure , but probably justifiable 6 . A future involvement in Bosnia - Genocide - so called 'Ethnic Cleansing' - Emotive - much TV coverage of atrocities and civilian casualties . - Probably justifiable 7 . Possible future use of nuclear weapons - tactical or strategic , somewhere in the world by the US in response to someone else - e.g . Libya or Israel . - My feelings in this are simple - Nuclear war/weapons are abhorrent - I love the New Zealand government 's stand on banning all nuclear armed or powered warships from NZ port . - Never justifiable . These are my own views , I have looked at scripture , and I am confused . I would appreciate others view , particularly those based on scripture .

From : clipper @ csrc.ncsl.nist.gov ( Clipper Chip Announcement ) Subject : text of White House announcement and Q & As on clipper chip encryption Organization : National Institute of Standards & Technology Distribution : na Lines : 282 Note : This file will also be available via anonymous file transfer from csrc.ncsl.nist.gov in directory /pub/nistnews and via the NIST Computer Security BBS at 301-948-5717 . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - THE WHITE HOUSE Office of the Press Secretary _________________________________________________________________ For Immediate Release April 16 , 1993 STATEMENT BY THE PRESS SECRETARY The President today announced a new initiative that will bring the Federal Government together with industry in a voluntary program to improve the security and privacy of telephone communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement . The initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links . For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting Americans . Rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth , privacy and law enforcement , previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement . Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer . It is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files . While encryption technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information , it also can be used by terrorists , drug dealers , and other criminals . A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the `` Clipper Chip '' has been developed by government engineers . The chip represents a new approach to encryption technology . It can be used in new , relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone . It scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today . This new technology will help companies protect proprietary information , protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically . At the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal , state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals . A `` key-escrow '' system will be established to ensure that the '' Clipper Chip '' is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding Americans . Each device containing the chip will have two unique 2 '' keys , '' numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device . When the device is manufactured , the two keys will be deposited separately in two `` key-escrow '' data bases that will be established by the Attorney General . Access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap . The `` Clipper Chip '' technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans . To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology , the Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices . In addition , respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings . The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption 's dual-edge sword : encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry , but it also can shield criminals and terrorists . We need the `` Clipper Chip '' and other approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities . In order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches ( like the key-escrow system ) , the President has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates : -- the privacy of our citizens , including the need to employ voice or data encryption for business purposes ; -- the ability of authorized officials to access telephone calls and data , under proper court or other legal order , when necessary to protect our citizens ; -- the effective and timely use of the most modern technology to build the National Information Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and the competitiveness of American industry in the global marketplace ; and -- the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export high technology products . The President has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries , the Congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed . 3 The Administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a National Information Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to information . This infrastructure of high-speed networks ( `` information superhighways '' ) will transmit video , images , HDTV programming , and huge data files as easily as today 's telephone system transmits voice . Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure , the Federal Government must act quickly to develop consistent , comprehensive policies regarding its use . The Administration is committed to policies that protect all Americans ' right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law . Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet . The provisions of the President 's directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also available . For additional details , call Mat Heyman , National Institute of Standards and Technology , ( 301 ) 975-2758 . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S TELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE Q : Does this approach expand the authority of government agencies to listen in on phone conversations ? A : No . `` Clipper Chip '' technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans . Q : Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation encrypted using the device . What would they have to do to decipher the message ? A : They would have to obtain legal authorization , normally a court order , to do the wiretap in the first place . They would then present documentation of this authorization to the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug smugglers . The key is split into two parts , which are stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key escrow system . Q : Who will run the key-escrow data banks ? A : The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent entities . At this point , the Department of Justice and the Administration have yet to determine which agencies will oversee the key-escrow data banks . Q : How strong is the security in the device ? How can I be sure how strong the security is ? A : This system is more secure than many other voice encryption systems readily available today . While the algorithm will remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow system , we are willing to invite an independent panel of cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all potential users that there are no unrecognized vulnerabilities . Q : Whose decision was it to propose this product ? A : The National Security Council , the Justice Department , the Commerce Department , and other key agencies were involved in this decision . This approach has been endorsed by the President , the Vice President , and appropriate Cabinet officials . Q : Who was consulted ? The Congress ? Industry ? A : We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on encryption issues , and expect those discussions to intensify as we carry out our review of encryption policy . We have briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the decisions related to this initiative . Q : Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers ? A : The government designed and developed the key access encryption microcircuits , but it is not providing the microcircuits to product manufacturers . Product manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip manufacturer that produces them . Q : Who provides the `` Clipper Chip '' ? A : Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance , California , and will sell the chip to encryption device manufacturers . The programming function could be licensed to other vendors in the future . Q : How do I buy one of these encryption devices ? A : We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating the `` Clipper Chip '' into their devices . Q : If the Administration were unable to find a technological solution like the one proposed , would the Administration be willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more powerful encryption devices ? A : This is a fundamental policy question which will be considered during the broad policy review . The key escrow mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product that is more secure , more convenient , and less expensive than others readily available today , but it is just one piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to encryption technology , which the Administration is developing . The Administration is not saying , `` since encryption threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement , we will prohibit it outright '' ( as some countries have effectively done ) ; nor is the U.S. saying that `` every American , as a matter of right , is entitled to an unbreakable commercial encryption product . '' There is a false `` tension '' created in the assessment that this issue is an `` either-or '' proposition . Rather , both concerns can be , and in fact are , harmoniously balanced through a reasoned , balanced approach such as is proposed with the `` Clipper Chip '' and similar encryption techniques . Q : What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton Administration 's policy toward encryption will differ from that of the Bush Administration ? A : It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption technology in telecommunications and computing and are committed to working with industry and public-interest groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans' privacy , help businesses to compete , and ensure that law enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime and terrorism . Q : Will the devices be exportable ? Will other devices that use the government hardware ? A : Voice encryption devices are subject to export control requirements . Case-by-case review for each export is required to ensure appropriate use of these devices . The same is true for other encryption devices . One of the attractions of this technology is the protection it can give to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad . With this in mind , we expect export licenses will be granted on a case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these devices to secure their own communications abroad . We plan to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability of these products .

Or be a Buddhist ? The Buddha 's commandments are 500 yrs older than Christ 's and in my opinion tougher to follow . Moreover the Buddha says that we are intrinsically good ( as against Christ 's `` we are all sinners '' ) . Only we allow ourselves to be distracted . By meditating we can awaken ourselves ( etc etc ) . Also there is no concept of God in Buddhism . ( In my opinion you can be an Atheist and a Buddhist ) . But to `` awaken '' yourself is no easy task . Can you stay away from eating meat ? Can you sit still and think of nothing ( meditate ) for sometime everyday ? Buddhists do ( or are supposed to ) . Can you pray five times a day ? Can you fast for a month every year ( Ramzan ) . Are you willing to give 1/6 th of your income as tithe ? Muslims do . In fact I think Jesus was an ordinary man ( just as Buddha and Mohamed ) probably with a philosopy ahead of the times ( where he lived ) . Considering the fact that Christianity is a young religion ( compared to Hindiusm , Judaism , Zorasterism , Buddihsm ) it is also very probable that the Bible is merely a collection of borrowed ideas . ( There was a good deal of trade between the eastern lands and the middle east at the time of Christ ) . And perhaps some more . But leave the crap in it out ( `` woman was created after man , to be his helper '' etc ) . aras > just like weight lifting or guitar playing , drums , whatever it takes > time .

I am fairly sure that placement of the > steering wheel was pretty much arbitrary to the company at that time ... .. By the 1920s , there was a very active `` good roads '' movement , which had its origins actually in the 1890s during the bicycle craze , picked up steam in the teens ( witness the Linclon Highway Association , 1912 or so , and the US highway support act ( real name : something different ) in 1916 that first pledged federal aid to states and counties to build decent roads . Also , the experience of widespread use of trucks for domestic transport during WW 1 convinced the government that good raods were crucial to our national defense . Anyway , by the 20s there were plenty of good roads , at least around urban areas , and they were rapidly expanding into the countryside . This was the era , after all , of the first auto touring fad , the motel , the auto camp ground , etc . Two good books on the subject spring to mind - Warren Belasco `` America on the Road '' ( title may not be exact - author is ) and another called `` The Devil Wagon in God 's Country '' author I forget . Also , any of John Flink 's or John Bell Rae 's auto histories . As to placement of the steering wheel being arbitrary , by the early teens there were virtually no American cars that did not have the wheel on the left . In the early days , cars had the wheel on the left , on the right , and even in the middle , as well as sometimes having a tiller instead of a wheel . This was standardized fairly early on , though I do n't know why .

Well , I dont know if Windows is a mature OS , if I have seen one ( in which case that has to be X-Windows : ) ) , but dont be so quick to judge ... First of all to try to use plain vanilla Windows is as courageous as to try to use plain vanilla DOS . There are _lots_ of very nice commercial and shareware packages/utilities that will boost up Windows past what MS itself thought possible : ) ... For example , Norton Desktop for Windows 2.0 ( a replace- ment for ProgMan ) will give you group-within-a-group capability and will even change group icons , it will launch progs by association ( well , FileMan does that too ) or by dragging the file in the apps icon ( now Mac doesnt do that , huh ? : ) ) ... And the list goes on and on ... Now , Windows _is_ kinda hard to finetune , boost and configure , but thats trhe price to pay for not paying $ $ $ to get a Mac or an OS/2 capable machine ( an entirely differet story ... ) ... On the other hand if you dont like the idea of PM 's icons not correspnding to the files themselves , well they are not supposed to : ) .. PM is a Program _Launching_ utility not a file manager ... Modify your settings to have FM as your shell and not PM , or get a couple of utilities from cica that supposedly give you a 'Mac feel ' ... I dont wan na get in the discussion which is a better system : Mac 's are good in their own way -- they are _different_ not better or worse than Win PCs -- ( actually I am writing this from a Mac lab as a user assistant - so dont think I am partial to Win : ) ) By all means check out the stuff in cica ( ftp to ftp.cica.indiana.edu under the pub/pc/win3 subdir user : anonymous ) , or wait for StarTrek ( Mac 's OS on a PC ! ! ! -- the threads we are gon na have then ! ! ! : ) ) ...

Is it possible to create a OVERLAPPED THICKFRAME window without a title bar ; ie ( WS_OVERLAPPED | WS_THICKFRAME ) & ~WS_CAPTION I do n't seem to be able to get rid off the title bar . I have another question : I have a overlapped window ( say V ) which has few child windows ( a , b , c , etc ) The window shows up with all it 's children fine . Now , I create another child ( t ) with a WS_THICKFRAME style and placed on top of one or more of it 's siblings . Style WS_THICKFRAME is used so that I can resize it . How do I make sure that the child 't ' will always be at the top of it 's siblings . I used SetWindowPos ( ) and BringWindowToTop ( ) without success . What 's happening is that while I am resizing 't ' it shows up but as soon as I let go , it goes behild it 's siblings . Any help would be greatly appreciated .

Some will , and others will steer with their tuchuses . I do n't know how much the teaching of countersteering in the beginner course really helps the tuchus steerers . I was one , I guess that I always steered a bicycle that way , and I only got the hang of countersteering in normal riding *after* the course . I could do the countersteering swerves in the course no problem , but I only started using it in my normal riding when I decided that my turning at speed ( off-ramps and the like ) was a lot more difficult that it should have been . I knew how it works ( although that 's currently up for debate ) definitely knew *that* it works , as I could do it in swerves , but only figured it out later in my normal riding . Just a data point . I think that it 's not a bad idea to bring the idea up , but it 's best to let everyone tuchus-steer for the first lesson or two , so they can learn to shift gears before they have to worry about proper handlebar technique . > countersteering .

( allocation error , cross-linked ) Reply-To : b-banko @ uiuc.edu Organization : University of Illinois at Urbana Lines : 150 Hi . While running the MS Quick C compiler in a DOS window under Windows 3.1 this evening , I got a `` program has violated system integrity ... close all applications , exit windows and restart your computer '' error . I started to do this when I immediately got a `` Serious disk error '' message from Windows . `` hit return to retry '' . I did that about 5 times and then rebooted to find that quite a few files have been corrupted somehow . ( I am including the chkdsk output below . ) Questions : 1 ) Is there an easy way to restore everything to working order ? What might be some better approaches ? 2 ) What might have caused this ? Does the SMARTDRV cache make me more vulnerable ? ( I 'm suspicious of hard drive caches especially when they cache data writing . ) The straightforward approach would be to run chkdsk with the /f option to fix the disk and then it looks like I would probably have to reinstall Windows and a few other things .

So is n't that saving money ? Yes . But the point is that prices are competetive . Saturn may well be selling a car intended on giving the dealer a $ 2000 profit , but since a comperable Honda with $ 500 profit is more expensive , it may be well worth it to buy the Saturn . > Moreover , if Saturn really does reduce the dealer profit margin by $ 1000 , > then their cars will be even better deals .

Not necessarily . It seems to me that Saturn salesdroids , who do n't make a commision , whereas their counterparts at other dealerships generally do , make more $ $ per hour or whatever . This means that Saturn does n't give up the profit to their employees through commision , which IS taken out of per- car profits .

Such `` extra- > rational '' cases are curiosities -- not guides to methodology . As has been noted before , there is the distinction between _motivation_ and _method_ . No experimental result should be accepted unless it is described in sufficient detail to be replicated , and the replications do indeed reproduce the result . No theoretical argument should be accepted unless it is presented in sufficient detail to be followed , and reasonable , knowlegeable , people agree with the force of the logic . But people try experiments , and pursue arguments , for all sorts of crazy reasons . Irrational motivations are not just curiousities ; they are a large part of the history of science . There are a couple of negative points to make here : 1 ) A theory of qi could , conceivably , become accepted without direct verification of the existence of qi . For example , quarks are an accepted part of the standard model of physics , with no direct verification . What would be needed would be a theory , based on qi , that predicted medical reality better than the alternatives . The central theoretical claim could lie forever beyond experiment , as long as there was a sufficient body of experimental data that the qi theory predicted better than any other . ( I would n't hold my breath waiting for the triumph of qi , though . I do n't think that there is even a coherent theory based on it , much less a theory that explains anything at all better than modern biology . And it is hard to imagine a qi theory that would not predict some way of rather directly verifying the existence of qi . ) 2 ) Science has not historically progressed in any sort of rational experiment-data-theory sequence . Most experiments are carried out , and interpreted , in pre-existing theoretical frameworks . The theoretical controversies of the day determine which experiments get done . Overall , there is a huge messy affair of personal jealousies , crazy motivations , petty hatreds , and the like that determines which experiments , and which computations , get done . What keeps it going forward is the critical function of science : results do n't count unless they can be replicated . The whole system is a sort of mechanism for generate-and-test . The generate part can be totally irrational , as long as the test part works properly . Pasteur could believe whatever he liked about chemical activity and crystals ; but even Mitscherlich had to agree that racemic acid crystals were handed ; that when you separate them by handedness , you get two chemicals that rotate polarized light in opposite directions ; and the right-rotating version was indistinguishable from tartaric acid . Pasteur 's irrational motivation had led to a replicable , and important , result . This is where Lysenko , creationists , etc . fail . They have usually not even produced coherent theories that predict much of anything . When their theories do predict , and are contradicted by experiment , they do not concede the point and modify their theories ; rather they try to suppress the results ( Lysenko ) or try to divert attention to other evidence they think supports their position ( creationists ) . -- Mark A.

By initiating a DMA xfer . : ) Seriously , busmastering adapter have their own DMA ability , they do n't use the motherboards on-board DMA ( which is *MUCH* slower ) . ISA has no bus arbitration , so if two busmastering cards in 1 ISA system try to do DMA xfers on the same DMA channel the system will lock or crash . ( I forget ) Their are 8 DMA channels in an ISA system . 0-7 . 0-3 are 8-bit & 4-7 are 16-bit . The system uses DMA 0 , a SoundBlaster uses DMA 1 . I could buy a busmastering XGA-2 video card & a busmastering SCSI HA . In order for them to work properly , I would have to find out what DMA channel the XGA-2 card uses and then simply configure the SCSI HA to use a different DMA channel for its DMA xfers . I do n't know if multiple DMA xfers can go on at the same time on ISA . I 'm not sure if they can on EISA systems either . I do know that on EISA/MCA systems , you can allow BM cards to use the same DMA channel . Thanks .

Our three year old daughter suffers from this disease . Below is a press release that appeared in local newspapers . Hope you can join us . On Saturday , April 24 as part of Communiversity in Princeton , a local family will be having a bake and craft sale to raise money for and create public awareness about a rare disease called Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis . Bill and Marlene Stern 's daughter Lindsay is afflicted with this disease characterized by tumors attacking the inside of the larynx , vocal cords and trachea . Caused by a virus , the tumors grow , block the air passages and would lead to death from suffocation without continual surgery to remove the growths . Three year old Lindsay has undergone 11 operations thus far since her diagnosis last year and faces the prospect of over a hundred operations throughout her lifetime . Even though the disease is hardly a household word , it has affected the lives of enough people to inspire the formation of the Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis Foundation , a non-profit foundation whose goals are to provide support for patients and families by networking patients and publishing a newsletter , enhance awareness of RRP at the local and national level , and aid in the prevention , cure , and treatment . Since medical researchers know that the virus causing the disease is similar to those viruses causing warts , they feel a cure would be within reach if money were available for research . Because RRP is rare , it not only gets scant attention but also paltry funds to search for a cure . Part of the RRP Foundation 's mission is to change that . Anyone interested in contributing items to the bake and craft sale , please call Marlene or Bill at 609-890-0502 . Monetary donations can be made at the Foundation 's booth during Communiversity , April 24th , 12 to 4 p.m. , in downtown Princeton , or sent directly to : The Recurrent Respiratory Foundation 50 Wesleyan Drive Hamilton Sq. , NJ 08690 .

The crappiest drivers make out like bandits because they no longer have to bear the responsibility of paying for insurance that they have boosted in price for themselves by being crappy drivers . The good drivers now pay through the nose to spread the cost of the crappy drivers ' actions , and that 's not fair . Any plan that caps rates for crappy drivers is inherently a piece of shit , because the rest of us end up paying more . Any plan that uses speeding tickets as a basis for raising rates is also a piece of shit as it is based upon the lie that faster drivers are inherently less safe than slower drivers , and the NHTSA disproved that two years ago now .

Human gestation period is something like 39 weeks . That means third trimester abortions are those done after 26 weeks . In consulting a 1989 World Almanac , I see that 1 % of abortions in 1983 were done at 21 weeks or more . That 's about 1268 abortions in 1983 after 21 weeks . Unless the number of abortions performed has dropped dramatically , or a LOT of abortions are done between 21 and 26 weeks , I think you are wrong . By the way , Roe v. Wade allowed states to adopt very , very broad prohibitions on third-trimester abortions , but some states , such as California , declined to do so . It was reported* that what finally stopped third trimester elective abortions in the Bay Area was n't law , but that the only hospital doing them ran out of nurses , then doctors , willing to do them . Not surprisingly , the bay area NOW chapter was terribly upset about this . I remain pro-choice , but when pro-choicers compare abortion in a clinic to a religious ritual in a church , you have to start wondering a bit if the pro-life criticism of abortion as modern human sacrifice does n't have a grain of truth to it . -- Clayton E.

That makes real sense . Actually , it does make a reasonable amount of sense . Fixed disk sectors are buffered by the controller , and transferring them to memory with a 'rep insw ' ( or whatever the instruction is called ) is quite efficient ( single instruction , goes as fast as the controller/cpu know how to use the bus ) . Since the 286 was n't cached , the bus is likely a critical resource relative to CPU performance , and it 's possible that DMA bus interference would cause as much or more loss of CPU cycles ( for 'computing ' ) as does the 'rep insw ' sequence . The floppy , on the other hand , is not buffered , so that using the CPU for floppy data transfer ( as was done on the PC Jr , by the way ) really does stink . Wally Bass

Technically , *ALL* transformers are Tesla coils . In general though when someone refers to a Tesla coil , they mean an `` air core resonant transformer '' . The TV flyback version Tesla coil ( see the _Encyclopedia_of_Electronic_Circuits_ V3 , 106-1 for diagram ) has NOT an air core . It is of a class of circuit called '' Oscillating Shuttle Circuit '' ( OSC ) . Generally OSC 's are highly efficient , but this version uses transistors and resistors , which are very lossy devices . Typically Tesla used active reactances instead of passive resistors , so that he could achieve efficiencies of 99.5 % , and better . The usual application of an air-core resonant transformer , or of an OSC , is to produce strong EMI for wireless broadcasts . How well do you think your computer screen would work if we removed the HF HV Tesla ( flyback ) coil from it ? If we were to remove from our homes and industries all Tesla coils , our lights would go dark , our cars would sputter and die , our radios would go silent , our industries would grind to a halt , and we would have to go back to using coal for heat , gas for lamps , horses for transportation , steam for power , and telegraph for communication .

Around the base of the hourglass is a ring of water towers . Warm river water , coming from the steam condenser in the plant , is sprayed over louvres . The draft being pulled through the tower cools the water by both evaporation and convection . The sensible heat extracted from the cooling water is the driving force for draft generation . It should be noted that the hourglass-shaped cooling towers are used on both fossile and nuclear plants . It should also be noted that at locations where water is plentiful , the cooling towers are only used part time , when the discharge temperature would exceed some release limit . It was once thought that the warm discharge water was damaging to fish . Fishermen know that is thoroughly incorrect . Nontheless , stringent , usually state , regulations remain in some instances . Since it typically takes 60,000 hp worth of pumping to move the volume of water needed to cool a 1000 MWe plant , the cost of using the towers is not insignificant . -- John De Armond , WD4OQC |Interested in high performance mobility ?

I 'm not quite sure how these numbers are generated . It appears that in a neutral park Bo 's HR and slugging tend to drop ( he actually loses two home runs ) . Or do they ? What is `` equivalent average ? '' One thing , when looking at Bo 's stats , is that you can see that KC took away some homers . Normally , you expect some would-be homers to go for doubles or triples in big parks , or to be caught , and for that matter you expect lots of doubles and triples anyway . But Bo , despite his speed , hit very few doubles and not that many triples . So I would expect his value to have risen quite considerably in a neutral park . > That is good . Very good , in fact . But it probably does n't make the top > ten in the league . The 10th best EQA in the AL in 1992 was Dave > Winfield 's .296 ; Thomas was first at .350 .

Felix Jose has been a .350/.440 player in a fairly neutral park . I would offhand guess the ` 89- ` 90 Bo at around a .330/.530 player . Maybe .330/.550 . Not even close . > He got more attention from the media than was warranted from his > baseball playing , though ; his hype was a lot better than his hitting . > That is the basis for the net.comments about him being overrated . The > media would have you beleive he was a great hitter . I think he was a > good , maybe very good hitter . He was IMO , something like the 30th best > hitter in the majors . I 'd put him about there too . Note : I had n't realized the media had hyped him so much . I thought he was always viewed by them as a better football player , and only so-so at baseball . He did only have one 30-hr , 100-rbi season , and KC wasn't winning . Note 2 : I maybe have harped on this a bit in the past , but there is a mistake being made ( by the SDCN 's , as they are known , on this group ) with respect to players like Bo and Deion and Lofton ( and perhaps others ) . We find , that if you look at a large group of players , their past major and minor league numbers will predict their future numbers fairly well . Their are some caveats : the younger they are , the less good the prediction ; the lower the minor league , the less good ( I imagine ) , the more recent the player has left college ball , etc . Now of course , this prediction involves quite a bit of `` error . '' Sometimes a player with poor MLE 's ( Dave Justice , the 1990 Ventura ) becomes a star . Some hitters develop ( Shane Mack , Brian Downing ) , some do n't ( Oddibe McDowell , Mickey Brantley ) . This error involves real things : there are real reasons why Oddibe did n't hit and Shane did . It may ( who knows ) involve parks and batting coaches and wheaties and injuries and lifting and so on . But still , you have this big pool of players , and things work pretty well . One of the reasons for these predictions accuracy is the common background of the players . One thing we know about professional baseball players is that all of them ( or almost all ) have spent a good deal of time playing ball . Their backgrounds are similar . What has n't been established is what happens when you encounter a player with a different background ? Is there some reason to believe that a Bo , or a Deion , or a Lofton , or a Tony Gwynn ( ? ) , or an Ainge , or so on , has such a different background , that the standard model and standard assumptions fit this person slowly ? It has n't been established that you can use MLE 's with two-sport players . ( It has n't been established that you ca n't , but then statistics is , after all , an art ) . I personally think otherwise lucid individuals continually make completely nonsensical statements about Bo and Deion and Lofton . `` Look at those good-but-not-great minor league numbers , '' they say . Well , what happens if those numbers simply do n't mean what they usually mean ? It might mean that Ken Lofton suddenly has a better year in Houston than Tuscon . It might mean that Deion suddenly has a better half-year in Atlanta than Greenville . Then again , it might not . Ken and Deion might go right back in the tank this year , live up to those poor MLE 's . But you guys DO N'T KNOW . What 's worse , you do n't know that you do n't . And you do n't know that there are other players you wo n't know about -- injuries and lifting and wheaties again . You seem to think that the model is perfect and eternal . It 's not . It 's got some error . Oh well . Bill Guilford still thinks `` hairy butt is truly ugly '' might be right

You 're not playing with a full deck , are you ? Where would Turkey invade ? Are you throwing the Cyprus buzzword around with s.c.g . in the header in hopes that the Greek netters will jump the gun ? Yes indeed Turkey has the military prowess to intervene , what she wishes she had , however , is the diplomatic power to stop the hostilities and bring the parties to the negotiating table . That 's hard to do when Armenians are attacking Azeri towns . Armenian leaders are lacking the statesmanship to recognize the futility of armed conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that leads to stability is much better than a military faits accomplis that 's going to cause incessant skirmishes . Think of 10 or 20 years down the line -- both of the newly independent countries need to develop economically and neither one is going to wipe the other out . These people will be neighbors , would it not be better to keep the bad blood between them minimal ? If you belong to the Armenian diaspora , keep in mind that what strikes your fancy on the map is costing the local Armenians dearly in terms of their blood and future . It 's easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize craziness to have your feelings about Turks tickled . The Armenians in Armenia and N-K will be there , with the same people you seem to hate as their neighbors , for maybe 3000 years more . The sooner there 's peace in the region the better it is for them and everyone else . I 'd push for compromise if I were you instead of hitting the caps-lock and spreading inflammatory half-truths . cheers , BM

So what distinguishes , for example , the > Branch Davidian `` cult '' from the Presbyterian `` church '' ? Doctrinal > differences do n't answer the question , IMHO , so do n't use them as > an answer . As far as I can see , one of the big differences between Davidians and Christians is in who they follow . I have sometimes tried to put myself in the feet of one of Jesus 's disciples . Basically , they gave up a lot -- - career , possibly family , and well , a whole bunch , to follow Jesus . So what is the difference ? It is quite plain . Jesus was good and David Koresh was not . The problem is , I think , is that we try to legislate what is good and what is bad in terms of principles . For instance , there are thousands of laws in the U.S. governing what is legal and what is not . Often , it is hard to bring people to justice , because it is not possible to find a legal way to do it . If only we could trust judges to be just , then we could tell them to administer justice fairly , and justice would be followed . But since judges do n't always get it right , we have a complicated system involving precedent and bunches of other stuff which attempt to make the imperfect ( the justice of man ) into something perfect . But what I hear about the justice system in the U.S. tells me that quite the opposite is true . There is also a problem that we tend to judge the presentation more than the material being presented . So we might consider a ranting Christian to be bad , but an eloquent person from another religion to be good . This goes along with the American desire to protect the Constitution at all costs , even if it allows people to do bad things . I think that it is the message that is important . If a man is presenting a false message , even if he is ever ever so mild mannered , then that man is performing a tremendous disservice . I know that I am rambling here . I guess that what I am trying to say is that we should n't be looking for principles that tell us why the Davidians got it wrong . It is not wrong to follow and worship a person . But it is important to choose the right person . It is simple . Choose Jesus , and you got it right . Choose anyone else , and you got it wrong . Why ? Because Jesus is the begotten son of God , and nobody else is . Jesus was without sin , and nobody else was . Stephen

That 's right , and this is pretty impossible , right ? It would be ideal if we could believe for a while , just to try out religion , and only then determine which course of thought suits us best . But again , this is not possible . Not that religion warrants belief , but the belief carries with it some psychological benefits . There are also some psychological burdens , too . > When you speak of `` experiencing racism '' , do you mean that someone should > believe in racism , or that they should have racist things done to them ?

Alltough I do have a personal opinion on this > issue , I thought it would be nice to hear opinions of fellow christian > brothers and sisters from different countries and in different situations . > > My background : member of a ( orthodox ) Reformed Church . Let us say a little The ONLY unity I 've found which is true is when all parties involved are disciples . I came out of a church in which even the different congregations were always competing and arguing about which one was better and who had the better messages ( while none of them put anything into practice from those messages ) . Since becoming a disciple , I've found that when I travel to another church in the same movement , they are just as accepting there as any other . We had a retreat back in January when some of the congregation from Louisville , KY came up ( this retreat was for college students ) and it was as though I had known even the people from Louisville for years ( and I had only become a disciple the previous April and had never been to the church in Kentucky ) . One of the keys to unity is unselfish love and self-sacrifice . That is only one area in which disciples stand out from `` Christians '' . Also , another part of unity is a common depth of conviction . I 've also been a part of some `` Christian '' campus fellowships who were focused on unity between churches and saw that those churches had one thing involved : a lack of conviction about everything they believed . That was why they could be unified , they did n't care about the truth but delighted in getting along together . > The problem here in The Netherlands is that there are two other churches > ( denominations ) with the same characteristics . Both have the same > confessions ; there are only some differences with respect to - for > example - the matter of appropriation of salvation and how to `` use '' > our creeds . In essence a lot of people of these three churches have to > same faith and feel that they should become one church . But how , that is > the question . > Creeds ? What need is there of creeds when the Bible stands firmly better ? > So , here is a first question : > - can the congregation of Christ be separated by walls of different > denominations ? Or is this definitely an untolerable situation > according to the Scriptures ? According to the Scriptures , splits and differences of opinion are going to be there . As per a previous note , I mentioned that there are those who teach falsely by many means . There are also differences of opinion and belief . However , Scripture states : In the following directives I have no praise for you , for your meetings do more harm than good . In the first place , I hear that when you come together as a church , there re divisions among you , and to some extent I believe it . No doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of you have God 's approval ( 1 Corinthians 11:17-19 ) . How will God show his approval ? By fruitfulness ( see Acts 2:47 ) , but before that , there are these qualities : devotion to the apostles teaching fellowship communion filling with awe for God all having everything in common . glad and sincere hearts praising God enjoying the favor of the people All these are mentioned in Acts 2:42-47 . God also shows that those who have these qualities are persecuted . Look at Stephen , `` a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit '' ( Acts 6:5 ) who was later stoned ( Acts 7:54-60 ) . > - can one say that only one of these three churches is the > true church of Jesus Christ ? One can say that a church is the true church only if that church is perfect not only in the congregation but worldwide as a movement . I have yet to find that , but the closest one I 've found is the Boston Church of Christ movement , which constantly strives to have errors pointed out and corrected . It is also the only one I 've seen which is totally sold out to God . > > A problem closely related to these question is : > - can we cooperate with other Christians - from these two churches - > before there is a unity ? This question is especially important > for those who think that only one church can be the `` true one '' . > As for cooperation , that can always occur . Unity , on the other hand may never occur . As for those who think about only one church being the '' true one '' , I remind them that Mark 9:38-41 states that there are disciples who are not a part of the main group to begin with , but they will not lose their reward . As with the Boston movement , I 've heard numerous times this exact same thing , that there are disciples out there that are not a part of the Boston movement but that does not make them any less disciples . Of course , few people admit that they 've ever run into someone who has the qualities of a disciple outside the movement . I know I have n't . > Maybe this last problem sounds a little strange to most of you . > For your information : we have a lot of organizations here which > are founded by people of one specific church and whose members > are all members of that church . This has been considered as > '' correct '' for years . Only a few years ago people started to > discuss about this and now we are in the middle of this process . > Some organizations are opening their doors for people from > other churches etc . > I must warn that this sounds cliquey to me . A clique is a group which runs around together to some extent exclusively . This causes problems in fellowship and causes divisions . I would not say at all that this is something `` correct '' for a church/group to do for any reason . In one of the churches I attended , for example , there was an internal clique of people who were on the 14 different groups/committees/organizational heads of the congregation . They rarely talked to anyone else outside of the committees and seldom were voted out of office without another office being `` opened up '' so that they would have to step right back in . Their degree of exclusion was such that when the new pastor came , he nearly had to wipe out everything and start from scratch ( I wish he would 've since they still have no clue about what it means to be a disciple ) . Anyway , this rigidity in the clique is beginning to be broken down , but is still there . So , I must warn against such division within . There 's enough division without . > Thanks for your opinions in advance ! > > Maarten Joe Fisher

In fact Adiposity 101 mentions a similar study ( search for `` life events '' in any recent version of Adiposity 101 ) . The problem with anecdotal reports about individuals who have lost weight and kept it off is that we do n't know what caused the weight gain in the first place . This is critical because someone who gains weight because of something temporary ( drug effect , life event , etc . ) may appear successful at dieting when the weight loss was really the result of reversing the temporary condition that caused the weight gain . -- Chuck Forsberg WA7KGX ... ! tektronix ! reed ! omen ! caf Author of YMODEM , ZMODEM , Professional-YAM , ZCOMM , and DSZ Omen Technology Inc `` The High Reliability Software '' 17505-V NW Sauvie IS RD Portland OR 97231 503-621-3406

From : welty @ cabot.balltown.cma.COM ( richard welty ) Subject : rec.autos : Automotive Mailing Lists : how to set up your own Keywords : Monthly Posting Reply-To : welty @ balltown.cma.com Organization : New York State Institute for Sebastian Cabot Studies Lines : 116 Archive-Name : rec-autos/part6 [ New article as of 4 February 1993 -- rpw ] Many people want to set up mailing lists for their favorite automotive topics ; rather fewer know how to do it . This article will provide the essential information for doing so on standard Unix systems . A shell script and examples of alias file setups are included which presently run on a Sparc 2 here at balltown.cma.com for a number of mailing lists . Note that if you do set up an automotive mailing list , please let me know of the -request address so that I can list it in the montly rec.autos posting . Also inform the keeper of the Usenet list-of-lists ( check news.answers for this monthly posting . ) First of all , to get anywhere , you need to either 1 ) be a sysadmin , or 2 ) have some measure of assistance from your sysadmin . It is also important that you have reasonably good network connectivity ; if it seems like you get everything several days after anyone else , or that you have trouble getting email through , then your network connectivity is probably not good enough . Listserv : There is a handy automated mailing list package named listserv , which is available from several ftp servers on the network . Details of the installation and operation of listserv are beyond the scope of this article , but anyone who is considering running a large mailing list should probably look at listserv carefully . The Alias file : On a typical unix system ; there is a file named /usr/lib/aliases on whichever file server is your mail host ; it contains lines such as : foo : bar , baz , bletch which means that any email sent the name ` foo ' on that host is redistributed to users bar , baz , and bletch . thus , the simplest possible email list is my-favorite-car : member1 , member2 , member3 , my-address my-favorite-car-request : my-address this has a couple of problems ; the most noticeable one being that you have to be superuser to edit the alias file . however , you can do the following , with the connivance of your sysadmin : my-favorite-car : : include : /home/mydir/misc/autos/my-favorite-car-list my-favorite-car-request : my-address Where the file specified is a list of comma and newline separated addresses . This file can be in the list admin 's home directory , owned by the list admin . Bounced Mail : this still has a problem ; bounced mail usually gets distributed to all the members of the list , which is generally considered somewhat irritating . Therefore , the way that the driving school mailing list is set up is instructive ( Thanks to harpal chohan of the bmw list for this setup , by the way . I 'm not sure where he got it from . ) school-request : welty school-rebroadcast : : include : /home/newwelty/misc/autos/school/list school : `` |/usr/local/adm/bin/explscript school '' owner-school : school-request owner-school-out : school-request here 's what is going on here : the owner- and -request addresses are intended as traps for bounced mail coming from the network . the -request address also serves as the point of contact for administrative duties . school is what people send mail to ; instead of pointing at addresses , it points at a shell script which rewrites headers before resending the email . school-broadcast ( of which nobody except me knows the name ; the name has been changed here to protect my own sanity ) points at the actual list members . the shell script i use is as follows : -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - # ! /bin/sh cd /tmp sed -e '/^Reply-To : /d ' -e '/^Sender : /d ' -e '/^From /d ' | \ ( echo Reply-To : $ { 1 } @ balltown.cma.com ; \ echo Errors-To : $ { 1 } -request @ balltown.cma.com ; \ echo Sender : $ { 1 } -request @ balltown.cma.com ; \ cat - ) | \ /usr/lib/sendmail -om -f $ { 1 } -request @ balltown.cma.com \ -F `` The $ { 1 } Mailing List '' $ { 1 } -rebroadcast exit 0 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - note that this script does not know the name of the list ; the name is passed in from outside , so that the script may be used for multiple lists ( i run several out of this site . ) the script excises Reply-To : , Sender : , and From lines from the incoming message , substitutes for Sender : and Reply-To : , and adds Errors-to : 99.9 % of all email bounce messages end up being sent to the -request or owner- addresses if this header rewrite is done . For digested lists , there is some digestification software around . Hopefully I 'll be able to provide more information in a future version of this posting . richard welty ( welty @ balltown.cma.com ) -- richard welty 518-393-7228 welty @ cabot.balltown.cma.com `` Nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of a race car about either its pitch or roll axis '' -- Carroll Smith

I just wish he might equally > accept that those who `` esteem all days alike '' are similarly doing > their best to honor the Lord . I am myself an SDA and I am in total agreement with what Darius has to say . I also worship on Saturday to honor the Lord . Your mention of `` [ esteeming ] all days alike '' IMO has to do with the fast days observed by the Jews . But no matter how you interpret that passage , I do accept your worship on Sunday as being done in honor of the Lord , in contrast with what many of my fellow SDA believers may believe . To me , though , the bible overwhelmingly points to Saturday as the day to be kept in honor of creation and of God 's deliverance of the Israelites from Egyptian bondage . To those who would attempt to point out that my observance of Saturday is being legalistic , this is simply not the case . Rather , keeping Saturday allows me a full day to rest and contemplate God 's goodness and grace . > > However I 'd like to be clear that I do not think there 's unambiguous > proof that regular Christian worship was on the first day .

The idea was introduced to me once that the reason Paul wanted the Corinthians to lay aside money for the collection on the first day of the week was because that was when they received their weekly wages . Paul wanted them to lay aside money for the collection as first priority , before spending their money on other things . I do not have any proof in front of me for this though , although it would explain why they would lay aside money in their homes instead of a meeting . > So I think the most obvious reading of this is that `` on the first day > of every week '' simply means every time they gather for worship . > > I think the reason we have only implications and not clear statements > is that the NT authors assumed that their readers knew when Christian > worship was . It would seem to me that you assume that the christians in the NT regularly worshipped on the first day . I assume that the christians in the NT regularly worshipped on the seventh day . But I agree with you that we only have implications because the authors did assume the reader knew when worhip was . -- Mark

From : wdburns @ mtu.edu ( BURNS ) Subject : Interfaith weddings Organization : CCLI Macintosh Lab , Michigan Tech University Lines : 39 Hello everyone . Last week I posted a similar question to alt.wedding . Now I come in search of a deeper-level answer . My fiance is Lutheran and I am Catholic . We plan on getting married in her church because she is living there now and I plan on moving there in a month or so . I called my Catholic priest to find out what I needed to do in order for the marriage to be recognized by my church . Needless to say that I have found that there is no `` hard and fast '' rule when it comes to how the Catholic law for interfaith weddings is interpreted . But I 'm pretty sure that we CAN get married without too much problem ; the trick lies in the letter of dispensation . But that is not why I am here ... . What I 'd like to know is : What are the main differences between the Lutheran and Catholic religions ? My priest mumbled something about how the Eucharist was understood ... I have heard that if two religions combine soon , it would be these two . Any help would be appreciated ... Thanks so much !

A few books on the subject have also been mentioned in addition to the one you mentioned . These may be hard to find , but I think I may take a stab at it out of curiosity . I know the one film I saw on this subject was pretty weak and the only two quotes I have seen which were used to show science in the Koran ( which I posted here ) were also pretty vague . I suspect that these books will extrapolate an awful lot on the quotes they have . At least one poster on the Islam channel seems to have some misgivings about the practice of using the Koran to decide what is good science . I wonder if Islam has ever come up with the equivalent of the Christians '' Creation Science '' on any topic . It would be interesting to find a history of scientific interpretations of the Koran , to see if anyone used the Koran to support earlier science which has since been discarded . It is all too easy to look at science as it exists today and then `` interpret '' passages to match those findings . People do similar things with the sayings of Nostradamus all the time . Anyway , it is a rather unique claim of Islam and may be worth checking .

He wants Teppo Numminen , too . And Kurri , but for them the spots can not be left open for too long . Esa Tikkanen we have already . Even without these players I think we have pretty good team . Young , hungry , talented guys , no old players that have got everything ( except the gold ) . Yesterday 's practise game , SWE-FIN 6-6 , shows that the two world 's best hockey teams ; ) are in prime shape . The Finn line Riihijarvi ( slightly injured ) -Saarikoski-Viitakoski shined . I bet these two teams are the best in the NHL , too . Roger , Roger ? What do you people think about Team Canada with Lindros , Brind'Amour , Burke , Ranford , Recchi , Dineen ... ?

Coaching news : Alpo Suhonen ( ex-Jets ) to Jokerit ( now verified ) , Boris Majorov ( ex-Jokerit ) to Tappara , Vasili Tichonov ( ex-Assat ) to San Jose Sharks ( assistant coach ) , Sakari Pietila to Lulea ( silver team in Elite-serien ) FW Mikko Makela ( ex-TPS ) to Malmo IF .

The sad truth is : sometimes that is good , or at least , better than the alternative . > But let 's ignore guns for defence and/or crime and look at gun accidents . Ok . There are about 1400 fatal firearm accidents per year [ 1 ] , and the number has been in decline since early this century [ 2 ] . Most of these accidents involve rifles or shot guns , not handguns . ... > But seriously : a gun is designed to fire a bullet . This is not so you > can shoot cardboard cut outs down at the range . In fact there are both guns and bullets designed specifically for that . The idea that my Ruger Mark II Bull Barrel ( a semi-auto 0.22 caliber handgun ) was designed to kill or hurt people , even for self defense , would , I 'm sure , come as a surprise to its designer . It certainly isn't why I have it . It certainly would hurt someone if you shot them with it , and might even kill them , but it is simply wrong to say it was designed to kill people . > This is not designed to act as a tool for home defence where you show > someone that you have a gun and they go `` Gee , perhaps I should leave '' . In fact , that is what happens most of the time . Most self defensive uses of firearms do n't involve firing any shots . Most criminals would prefer not to be shot , and will go to some effort not to be , including doing what you say when you point a gun at them . If you were called on to design a tool , that could be easily carried , to immediately stop someone attacking you , what would it be ? A handgun is about the best anyone has come up with and experience shows it does work the best . [ 3 ] > No , you see the gun was designed to fire that little bullet into a human > body and hurt them . Not a tough concept to swallow , for most . Certainly , no one argues that handguns ( of the type we are discussing ) are n't deadly weapons . However , it simply is n't true to say that all of them were designed to kill people . Moreover , what exactly is wrong with having deadly weapons ? There are times when it is perfectly legitimate to use deadly force , e.g . in self defense . I consider it not just my right , but my duty to defend myself and my family , and that includes having and knowing how to use the tools to do that . `` The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is , as a last resort , to protect themselves against tyranny in government . '' - T. Jefferson . I think what Jefferson said is still true . > And the trouble with having such an item is often the little bullet goes > off into the wrong fleshy target . Not very often compared to other use . [ 3 ] > Or else Uncle Frank gets pissed and blows away his wife . This is n't that common either , at least when compared to other uses . It is very rare that a non-violent person will suddenly `` get-pissed '' and kill someone , gun or not . In most cases , the people who murder have long histories of violence . If you have good reason to believe that these people would n't kill if they did n't have a gun , feel free to present it . > Having a thing specificly designed to kill means it is much easier to > kill things . Right ? Right , but there are times when killing things is called for . I hope I never have to shoot a person , but I 've had to kill a number of animals from rodents to cows , and when I do , I do n't want them to suffer any more than is necessary . I prefer they die instantly , but failing that , I want them to drop so I can quickly finish them with the next shot , and failing that , I do n't want them to go fast or far . I try to choose the best weapon and ammunition I have to try to achieve that goal for the size of animal I'm after , but it does n't always work as I plan . Without belaboring the point , people who are overly impressed with the killing or shopping power of guns , particularly handguns , have n't used them much for that purpose .

In 1932 , the accidental deaths by firearm per 1,000,000 people was 24.03 . In 1987 , it was 5.74 . The decline has been steady , consistent , and a fairly straight line when plotted . At the rate of the last sixty years , it will reach zero sometime around 2025 AD .

Grant Fuhr , Essa > Tikkannen , Butch Goring , Bob Nystrom , Bob Gainey , Doug Jarvis , Derek > Sanderson , Wayne Cashman , Bob Baun , Bob Pulford , Ralph Backstrom , Henri > Richard , Dick Duff ... and so on ... These players all are pretty good players . They are the depth that the dynasties had to win Stanley Cups . They tend to be the very good second line guys- who would be first liners on most weaker clubs in the NHL . They were all important to their clubs . Probably , several of these Stanley Cup winning teams would not have won the cups they did if it were not for the depth provided by these players . They compare to Rick Tocchet and Ron Francis of the Penguins . Very good players who can lead lesser teams ( Francis-Hartford , Tocchet-Philly ) who provide the depth to the team that is currently best in the NHL . As a defensive forward , there have been none better than Bob Gainey . That does n't mean he was the best player ( or even the best forward ) the Canadians had at that time , but he was excellent at what he did . Gainey could dominate games with his defence . He did n't need to get goals to dominate . He shut down the opposition and was thus valuable . There has never been anyone any better at doing this . Not ever . Gregmeister

While the SONY-APPLE CD-ROM > drive has an access time of 300 ms for the doublespin models . > > - Chung Yang > I have the a CD-Technology drive with the Toshiba mechanism , and it is supposedly the fast and best now . It has an access of 200ms and a data transfer rate 300Kb/sec . It is multisession photo-cd compatible . It is available from educorp for $ 599 , the CD-Technology one , and comes with two mail in coupons for two free CDs . I 'm not sure if the cd 's are good , since I 've only had the drive a little less than a month and had the cd 's shipped to my home address in california instead of here in maryland . The CD-technology drive has a separate power supply separated from the drive , which supposedly gives it a longer life , and keeps it cleaner with no fan to attract dust . A Toshiba brand drive is also available , but I think the CD-Technology is better , since you get the same mechanism , and at a slightly lower price with two free CDs . The Apple 300/330i Drive , Sony Mechanism , is around a 300ms access time I think , and a data transfer rate of 300Kb/sec . I know it is the slowest of the three mentioned here . It is not widely available , except through the apple catalog , which is bad at a price of only $ 599 . It is also multi-session photo cd compatible . I think the external model comes with 7 free cds , some of which are pretty good . The NEC drive has been out the longest . it has an access time of 280ms and a data transfer rate of 300Kb/sec . it is available from many vendors around $ 600 dollars , including Educorp . It was n't multi-sesssion photo-cd compatible before , but I hear that the current version that is shipping is . Owners of the older drives can get an upgrade . It does not come with any free cd's unless you buy it in a bundle . Of the three CD-Rom drives above , i think the best choices would be the Apple drive and the CD-technology ( toshiba ) drive . The apple drive for it's compatibility with apple products and the cd-technology ( toshiba ) for it's speed and performance . BTW , the models of the drives are : Apple : AppleCD 300 or AppleCD 300i ( internal ) CD-Technology : CD-T3401 ( the Toshiba brand name model I 'm not sure , but it is also something like with 3401 ) NEC : CDR-74 I 'm very happy with my drive . And have had no compatibility problems whatsoever . If I am wrong about any of the above , do correct me , but I am pretty sure of myself , even when I think I 'm not . Also , some of you out there might notice that I have the same last name as the president of CD-Technology which happens to be in southern california , my hometown . However , I AM NOT a relative nor do I know the guy . Liu is just a common chinese name , especially in southern california , with the enormous chinese community . Besides , one of my doctors in california has three Steve Liu 's as patients and another Steve Liu comes to my school and lives in the next dorm . This is to show that Liu is very common .

Particularly , I would like to hear about power ( manual t. only ) reliability , feel , and any unusually good or bad features of the line . She currently drives a VW Passat , and is being plagued by its electrical problems . The dealer claims there is nothing wrong , even though the doors have a habit of locking and unlocking them- selves while you are driving down the road . The automatic shoulder restraints also like to move back and forth as you move along . She does not have the new , larger engine and is quite dissatisfied with its lack of power . The MB wagon would have to have more power and no peculiar problems such as the Passat 's electrical system . She is also considering a Saab 9000 ( add some letters ) .

I 'd be willing to wager that both the Sharks and Senators > will probably see their 3rd GM 's and perhaps their 4th , before we > see the Panthers second . Actually , fired-coach George Kingston was a third of the GM triumvirate . Now that the trio is now duo ( Dean Lombardi and Chuck Grillo ) , the Sharks are already on their 3rd `` office of the GM '' . And a 4th is likely to happen before September ; they 'll either add the new coach to the OofGM , or name a single GM . So your wager should be amended to read that Sharks are likely to have their 5th GM before the Panther 's get their 2nd . Ca n't wait to see how the next season 's NHL Guide and Record Book lists the GM history of the Sharks . Given the depth of next year 's draft , the expansion draft rules , and the reputation of their GMs , Anaheim and Miami look pretty good as the first 90s expansion teams to win a Cup .

Questions to Israelis Nf-ID : # R : cdp:1483500352 : cdp:1483500353:000:3689 Nf-From : cdp.UUCP ! cpr Apr 22 17:31:00 1993 Lines : 83 From : Center for Policy Research < cpr > Subject : rejoinder . Questions to Israelis Dear Josh I appreciate the fact that you sought to answer my questions . Having said that , I am not totally happy with your answers . 1 . You did not fully answer my question whether Israeli ID cards identify the holders as Jews or Arabs . You imply that U.S. citizens must identify themselves by RACE . Is that true ? Or are just trying to mislead the reader ? Do you know of any democratic country where people are asked to reveal their ethnical or religious identity to any public official who so requests ? 2 . The answer to the second question is evasive . There are all kinds of maps issued . They are not equivalent to State policy . You did not respond to my question . 3 . Your answer to the third question ( Israeli nuclear arsenal ) is interesting . You say that Israeli 'probably ' stocks nuclear weapons . What evidence have you for maintaining that ? 4 . My fourth question was answered by someone else who posted a Ma'ariv article documenting such cases . I did not ask about cases like Vanunu ( everybody knew he was tried and imprisoned ) but about those about whom nobody even knows that they have been tried and imprisoned . 5 . Thanks for clarifying the question concerning the legal status of the inhabitants of the occupied territories . From it I understand that there are two sets of laws in these ares , one for the occupier ( civil law ) and one for the occupied ( military law ) . The law allows Israeli Arabs to settle in Hebron , it seems . If so , why does n't it allow Hebron Arabs to settle in Israel ? 6 . Your answer to the question concerning rights to return conflicts with what I was told , namely that hundreds of thousands of non-Jews who left for some reason or other the area under Israel control during the war of 1947-8 , were prevented from returning for the sole reason they were not Jews . Jews who also left , for example to Europe , to avoid the clashes , were allowed to return . How can you justify such discrimination , if this is true ? Is the mere fact of a person leaving area of combat to seek refuge somewhere else a reason for stripping him of his right to live in his homeland ? 7 . Somebody answered my 7.question regarding Y. Rabin signing an order for ethnical cleansing in 1948 . According to that information , Y. Rabin signed the order for the expulsion of all inhabitants of Lydda and Ramleh , about 50,000 people . These expulsions were helped by massacres of civilians and other atrocities which remind Bosnia . I was referred to a book by Israeli journalist Benny Goodman called The Origin of the Palestinian Refugee Problem , published by Cambridge University Press . Is this book available in your library ? 8 . You maintain that there are some Israeli Arabs living in Israeli kibbutzim . I wonder how many and where . There is very little evidence available about that . As much as I know , many Arabs are working *for* kibbutzim , even for many years , but are not accepted as members . Could it be that kibbutzim do not want Arabs ? 9 . My question about the lack of civil marriage in Israel was whether it is true that the Israeli legislator intended to discourage intermarriage . You did not address this question but evaded it by saying that the 'entire religious establishment wants to keep it what way ' . I am certain that if only religious communities in the U.S. would be asked , they would gladly abolish civil marriage so that people would depend upon rabbis and priests to officiate marriages . But Israel has always been ruled by a secular majority . Your answer is not satisfactory . I would be glad to have some more input from you after these comments . Elias

The answer to your first question is rather difficult to answer without doing a lot of autopsies . The second question is something that 's been known for some time . It appears that within about 15 years of quitting smoking a person 's risk for developing lung cancer drops to that of the person who never smoked ( assuming you do not get lung cancer in the interim ! ) . The risk to someone who smoked the equivalent of a pack per day for 40 years is around 20 times as high as a non-smoker . Still rather low overall , but significant . Personally , I 'd be more concerned about heart disease secondary to smoking -- it 's much more common , and even a small increase in risk is significant there . -- =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-|-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= = Kenneth Gilbert __|__ University of Pittsburgh = = General Internal Medicine | `` ... dammit , not a programmer ! = =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-|-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

From 3DO , RJ Mical ( of Amiga/Lynx fame ) and Hal Josephson ( sp ? ) were there to talk about the machine and their plan . We got to see the unit displaying full-screen movies using the CompactVideo codec ( which was nice , very little blockiness showing clips from Jaws and Backdraft ) ... and a very high frame rate to boot ( like 30fps ) .

I 'm sure if the material had been compressed at the large size then it would play back fine ( I have a Q950 and do this quite a bit ) . The price of generality ... personally I do n't use the dynamic sizing of movies often , if ever . But playing back stuff at its original size is plenty quick on the latest 040 machines .

I do hope that you are not suggesting that merely because a person replies in an `` acrid , angry and sarcastic '' manner that this demonstrates their 'non-christianity ' ? The simple fact is that there is not a Christian on the face of the planet ( that I know of ! ) that is perfect . I have been known at times to have a fit of temper , or a sulk , but this does not make me any the less a Christian . One of the points of being a Christian ( as I perceive it ) is to become MORE LIKE Christ . This statement inherently suggests that we ARE NOT already like Christ . Jesus never unrighteously lost his temper . I do . Jesus was perfect . I 'm not . > We in the net village do have a laugh or two when professed , born again > christians verbally attack people who might otherwise have been won to > christianity and had originally joined the discussions because they were > `` spiritually hungry . '' Instead of answering questions with sweetness and > sincerity , these chrisitan net-warriors , `` flame '' the queries . You must understand that this is because Christians often forget to treat others as our role-model - Christ - would . This is because we are human and falible . I , for one , do not pretend to be infalible , and I hope that my fellow-men will bear with me when I make mistakes . This surely is not too much to ask , when I make every effort to bear with _them_ . > You do n't need any enemies . You already do yourselves the greatest harm . And do n't we know it ! > Again I say , foolish , foolish , foolish . Again I say , we are ALL human ! To my brethren , this : Ms Duticci has a valid point and we as Christians ought to heed the warning in her article . We oftimes discredit ourselves and our Saviour , in the way that we treat others . Strive towards the goal set us by our Lord , but in the meantime , remember : `` There is no condemnation for those who are in Christ ... '' When you blow it - go easy on yourself . Forgive yourself , as your Father in heaven forgives you ! And remember - and this is something I firmly beieve and cling to - one day , we shall see Him face to face , and in that day , we shall ( finally ! ) be perfected .

In my post I was referring to your regular patrolman in a car |cruising around the city vs. gang members . Of course the police have access |to the things that you mentioned but do they use tanks and such all of the |time ? Of course they do n't and that 's the point I was trying to make . Every |day when I go out to lunch I always see cops coming in . The majority that I |see are still carrying revolvers . Not that there is anything wrong with a |revolver but if you 're a cop that is up against some gang member with a couple |of automatics in his coat ( I mean semi-auto handguns ) you 're going to be at a |disadvantage even with training . I have been at a shooting range where gang |gang members were `` practicing '' shooting . They were actually practicing |taking out their guns as quick as possible and shooting at the target |and they were n't doing too badly either . The University cops here ( who are |are state cops ) are armed better than the Chicago police . It seems most |state cops are . I do n't know where you are originally from David but you live |in Tennesse and I live in Chicago and see this crap everyday on the news |and in the papers . I think the situation is just a tad different here |than there . However , do n't forget that the police in Chicago can carry just about anything they want except for the Glock , which is not approved for carry ( Guess they figure all cops are like the Police Chief of Winnetka , who happened to let off a stray round of 9mm . This is the same anti-gun police chief that wanted full-auto Uzis for his patrol cars ... ) . Perhaps in the judgement of the majority of Chicago 's finest , a close-to- 100 % reliable weapon like a revolver is preferable to a 99.99 % reliable automatic . I note that in Germany , where certainly the 9mm semi-auto handgun is king , some of the more elite police types want revolvers . I do n't think the issue is cost , because Chicago police certainly make on the order of at least $ 40K/year . Your presumption of `` disadvantage '' I think is not borne out by the experiences of New York City 's cops ; there the cops usually come out on top with their standard .38 Spl revolvers . I 've seen S & Ws , Rugers and Beretta 9mms in addition to the revolvers carried by Chicago cops ... . in the past , I 've seen .45 M1911s ; others have seen Browning Hi-Powers ... |Jason

From : zyeh @ caspian.usc.edu ( zhenghao yeh ) Subject : Ellipse Again Organization : University of Southern California , Los Angeles , CA Lines : 39 Distribution : world NNTP-Posting-Host : caspian.usc.edu Keywords : ellipse Hi ! Everyone , Because no one has touched the problem I posted last week , I guess my question was not so clear . Now I 'd like to describe it in detail : The offset of an ellipse is the locus of the center of a circle which rolls on the ellipse . In other words , the distance between the ellipse and its offset is same everywhere . This problem comes from the geometric measurement when a probe is used . The tip of the probe is a ball and the computer just outputs the positions of the ball 's center . Is the offset of an ellipse still an ellipse ? The answer is no ! Ironically , DMIS - an American Indutrial Standard says it is ellipse . So almost all the software which was implemented on the base of DMIS was wrong . The software was also sold internationaly . Imagine , how many people have or will suffer from this bug ! ! ! How many qualified parts with ellipse were/will be discarded ? And most importantly , how many defective parts with ellipse are/will be used ? I was employed as a consultant by a company in Los Angeles last year to specially solve this problem . I spent two months on analysis of this problem and six months on programming . Now my solution ( nonlinear ) is not ideal because I can only reconstruct an ellipse from its entire or half offset . It is very difficult to find the original ellipse from a quarter or a segment of its offset because the method I used is not analytical . I am now wondering if I did n't touch the base and make things complicated . Please give me a hint . I know you may argue this is not a CG problem . You are right , it is not . However , so many people involved in the problem `` sphere from 4 poits '' . Why not an ellipse ? And why not its offset ? Please post here and let the others share our interests ( I got several emails from our netters , they said they need the summary of the answers ) . Yeh USC

We shall never be rough and heartless when it is not necessary , that is clear . We Germans , who are the only people in the world who have a decent attitude towards animals , will also assume a decent attitude towards these human animals .

Patrick Roy is the reason the game was lost , and Ron Hextall is the reason Quebec won . Everybody said it would come down to goaltending , that goaltending was the key , etc etc . Well , the key does n't quite fit if you're Montreal . The Dionne penalty was kind of a cheesy call , but let 's face it ; he literally left his feet to throw an elbow . Blaming Stewart is just an excuse to avoid facing the fact that Roy allowed what was one of the worst goals he could possibly allow . He even saw the whole shot , dammit . Besides , Stewart evened things up a bit by calling a Quebec penalty in OT . Montreal played a solid game ( although they still do n't know how to clear traffic in front of the net ; the loss of Schneider will hurt even more ) . Normally I would say that any team that blows a 2-goal lead with less than five , let alone two , minutes to go in regulation time IN A PLAYOFF GAME ESPECIALLY needs to be smacked upside their collective heads . But I don't think this was a team loss ( although Keane should have been able to clear the zone just prior to the first Quebec goal ) . Roy is paid big money to play . He looked like a player in an industrial league on Sakic 's shot . Demers should start Racicot in the next game . If not that , he should let the damn team read the papers for the next day or two ... .and maybe this article , if possible . > Patrick Roy collapsed after letting in the tieing goal . He was shaky and > on his knees for the rest of the night . The winning goal should n't have > gone in . I did n't think the wrap-around was as bad as the second goal .

But you are correct , it should n't have gone in regardless . > Oh well , at least the Bruins lost in O.T . also Ha , Ha ! ! -- ) Yep . Moog looked bad on Mogilny 's goal with five seconds left in the second , IMO . How about Neely though ? Holy shit , what a player . Speaking of great players , man-oh-man can Quebec skate . I have n't seen a team so potent on the rush in a long time . Watching them break out of their zone , especially Sundin , is a treat to watch . They remind me of the Red Army . But I still hate the team . On the rest of the games : Did n't St. Louis ' winning goal come on a powerplay ? Penalties will cost Chicago dearly , especially against Detroit . Same goes for Calgary ; very , very undisciplined . When Marty McSorely is waving guys to the bench to *avoid* fights , you know something 's up . New Jersey was overmatched , Terreri 's heroics notwithstanding . Mario is unbelievable , and Jagr for some reason shows up in the playoffs .

There is really nothing inherently wrong with it but they tried it just a little over a decade ago , and noone showed up for the early rounds in the playoffs ... whereas soon after they went to the divisional set-up arenas were mostly filled in the early rounds . The empirical evidence of the last two decades is that more people will show up to see the Bruins play the Sabre umpteen times than see the Bruins play the Captials in the first round . Maybe hockey has increased in popularity sufficiently that this will no longer be the case . The experiment is worthwhile with the uneven distribution of the expansion teams , but I prefer the divisional playoff . Gerald

Is it true that the State of Israel has no fixed borders and that Israeli governments from 1948 until today have refused to state where the ultimate borders of the State of Israel should be ? 3 . Is it true that Israeli stocks nuclear weapons ? If so , could you provide any evidence ? 4 . Is it true that in Israeli prisons there are a number of individuals which were tried in secret and for which their identities , the date of their trial and their imprisonment are state secrets ? 5 . Is it true that Jews who reside in the occupied territories are subject to different laws than non-Jews ? 6 . Is it true that Jews who left Palestine in the war 1947/48 to avoid the war were automatically allowed to return , while their Christian neighbors who did the same were not allowed to return ? 7 . Is it true that Israel 's Prime Minister , Y. Rabin , signed an order for ethnical cleansing in 1948 , as is done today in Bosnia-Herzegovina ? 8 . Is it true that Israeli Arab citizens are not admitted as members in kibbutzim ? 9 . Is it true that Israeli law attempts to discourage marriages between Jews and non-Jews ? 10 . Is it true that Hotel Hilton in Tel Aviv is built on the site of a muslim cemetery ? Thanks , Elias Davidsson Iceland email : elias @ ismennt.is

What justification do you have for this ? No , Mathew is proposing a public defence mechanism , not treating the electronic device as an impropriety on the wearer . What he is saying is that the next step beyond what you propose is the permanent bugging of potential criminals . This may not , on the surface , sound like a bad thing , but who defines what a potential criminal is ? If the government of the day decides that being a member of an opposition party makes you a potential criminal then openly defying the government becomes a lethal practice , this is not conducive to a free society . Mathew is saying that implanting electronic surveillance devices upon people is an impropriety upon that person , regardless of what type of crime or what chance of recidivism there is . Basically you see the criminal justice system as a punishment for the offender and possibly , therefore , a deterrant to future offenders . Mathew sees it , most probably , as a means of rehabilitation for the offender . So he was being cynical at you , okay ? Jeff .

From : JEK @ cu.nih.gov Subject : muslim tithe ; sexism in Genesis 2 Lines : 33 According to mdbs @ ms.uky.edu , muslims tithe 1/6 of their income . Perhaps there are some offshoots of Islam that impose this on their followers . But the standard tithe is 1/40 of one 's net worth , once a year . The same writer also objects to the Bible for teaching that > `` woman was created after man , to be his helper '' etc . This is presumably a reference to Genesis 2 . Suppose that that chapter had been written with the sexes reversed . We have God creating woman , and then saying , `` It is not good that woman should be alone . I will make a help meet for her . '' Feminists would be outraged . The clear implication would be that God had started at the bottom and worked up , making first the plants , then the fish and birds , then the beasts , then woman , and finally His masterpiece , the Male Chauvinist Pig . The statement that woman is not capable of functioning by herself , that she needs a man to open doors for her , would have been seen as a particularly gratuitous insult . The fact that the creation of woman from the dust of the ground was given only briefly and in general , while the creation of the Man was given in six times the number of words , would have been cited as evidence of the author 's estimate of the relative importance of the sexes . The verdict would have been unequivocal . `` No self-respecting woman can accept this book as a moral guide , or as anything but sexist trash ! '' I suggest that Moses , fearing this reaction , altered his original draft and described the creation with Adam first and then Eve , so as to appease Miriam and other radical feminists of the day . For some reason , however , it did not work . Yours , James Kiefer

So the question is reversed , `` Why can't > we assume the universe just exists as you assume God to > `` just exist '' ? Why must there be a `` why '' to the universe ? '' [ remainder of message deleted ] Pardon me for replying to only a portion of your message : ) The reason we can say `` God just exists '' and ca n't say `` The universe just exists '' is because the universe is a natural realm and is subject to natural laws in general and the law of cause and effect in particular . That is , we observe in nature that every cause has an effect , and every effect was produced by a cause . The existence of the natural realm , as an effect itself , can not be its own cause ; it must therefore have a supernatural cause . God , on the other hand , is a supernatural being , and is therefore not subject to such natural laws as the law of cause and effect . As a supernatural being , God 's eternal existence does not imply a previous cause the way the existence of a physical , natural cosmos does . Thus , those who believe in the supernatural have a valid basis for accepting the existence of uncaused phenomena such as the eternal God , whereas those who deny the existence of the supernatural are faced with the dilemma of a physical universe whose very nature shows that it is not sufficient to explain its own existence . This is , of course , an oversimplification of a complex topic , but I just wanted to clarify some important differences between the supernatural ( God ) and the natural ( the universe ) , since you seem to mistake them as being interchangeable . - Mark

However , a 2nd dog suddenly appeared and collided with my right front bumper and the force of the impact was enough to kill that Scottish Terrier . Apparently , it was following the 1st dog . Henceforth , if a dog decides to cross the street , keep an eye out for a 2nd dog as many dogs like to travel in pairs or packs . I 've yet to experience a dog chasing me on my black GL1200I which has a pretty loud OEM horn ( not as good as Fiamms , but good enuff ) but the bike is large and heavy enough to run right over one of the smaller nippers while the larger ones would have trouble getting my leg between the saddlebags and engine guards . I'd def feel more vulnerable on my '68 Trump as that 'd be easier leg chewing target for those mongrels . If there 's a persistent dog running after bikers despite complaints to the owner I would n't be adverse to running over it with my truck as a dogs life is n't worth much IMHO compared to a child riding a bike who gets knocked to the ground by said dog and dies from a head injury .

Can any crypto > implementation for which highly publicly scrutinized source code is not > available EVER be trusted ? After IBM had invented the DES and the NBS had advertised for proposals , but before IBM had decided to respond , I argued strenuously that they should not ; they should keep it proprietary . The biggest proponent of proposing was Dr. Lewis Branscomb . Dr. Branscomb was the IBM Chief Scientist and had come to IBM from NBS . Fortunately for all of us , Dr. Branscomb understood the answer to the above question much better than I . He realized how difficult it would be to gain acceptance for any cryptographic mechanism . Because of the necessary complexity , publicity would not be sufficient and neither would authority . In fact , it has taken both of those plus more than 15 years . We have also had independence . The DES was solicited by NBS , invented and proposed by IBM , and vetted by NBS . It has also been examined and vetted by experts like Adi Shamir , who are not subject to influence by any of these . Even now , there are still people posting on this list who do not trust the DES in spite of all the time , all of the analysis , and all of the public scrutiny . ( Of course , it is just this point that NIST misses when it attempts to gain acceptance for a novel mechanism , developed in secret , on the basis of authority alone . ) We had a long thread here about whether or not the NSA can `` break '' the DES . That is a silly question . At some cost and in some time they can `` break '' anything . The important question is at what cost and in what time . The fundamental strength of the DES and RSA are not nearly so important as what we know about their strength . As long as we understand the cost and duration for an attacker , then we can use them in a safe way . At this point , we may never replace either because of the inability of any successor to overcome this knowledge gap . DES and RSA are among the most significant inventions of the century and the most important inventions in the history of cryptography . We are damned lucky to have them .

Just the 2 U bolts on each side and the shock absorber . Jacking up the frame some more ( had to put the spare tire on the garage floor and put a wooden platform on top of that to get the 'floor jack ' high enough to raise the frame ... I't one TALLL truck ... ) lifted the spring free of the axel . Taking out the block gave me enough room to undo the pin holding the spring pack together . The spring pack was held together with a nut on top and a round head on the other end ... . No wrench head ... Vice Grips worked fine ... I soaked the nut with WD40 and it came right off .

I 'm a little more sore today than after working on a 1911A1 ... A 1.5 foot pipe cheater was a real help . Torque spec for the U bolt nuts is 150 to 200 ft-lbs ( ! ) . A 1911-A1 does n't have that kind of torque spec ... It was a 'challenge ' to get the 'pack bolt ' back in the spring pack . Squeeze pack with two hands , hold bolt with third , put nut on with fourth while picking up wrench and vice grips with fifth and sixth hands ... I used some string to tie the pack together while holding the pin in for alignment ... then I could let go to get the { nut , wrench , Vice Grips ... } . Getting the pin back lined up with the lift block was a challenge too ... until I discovered that the axel had 1 ) Tilted and/or 2 ) rolled forward . One the drivers side , a bottle jack under the front of the differential tilted it back in line enough for the pin head to drop into the right hole . On the passenger side , I had to wrestle the wheel into rolling forward about 1/2 inch to get things to line up . Spent more than an hour working on getting the pin head into the hole in the lift block with levers and ropes and impliments of distruction before I took a break and thought about WHY it was n't lined up anymore ( since it HAD been lined up before , and *I* did n't move it , something ELSE must have ... hmmm , axle no longer constrained not to move ... hmmm , move it back ... hmmm ... ) .

If you want a definition of human being that does not depend on the vagaries of law , but holds solid whatever the law may rule , provide it for me . > I would suggest that your blind faith would not likely hold up if the > shoe were on the other foot .

As Larry Margolis pointed out , the law has made special exceptions in order to include fetuses , but does not follow your version of human being . And as he pointed out , brain death is not a means of determining who has the rights of the living , but rather who has died . There is a significant difference .

If you really wanted a discussion of substance , why then do you disregard logic and substance in order to toss silly accussations , e.g . `` It really does n't matter to you ... '' If it matters to you , then why not define human being and seek some substance ?

As others point out , one is sacrificed for the other depending on which has the better chance at survival . Again , your analogy fails . Not precedence , but possession makes a difference here . A woman 's womb is indisputably her own . Also , I see you ignore my statement that you would grant rights to a fetus that would not be granted a born human being .

Note the use of the phrase `` it should be '' > in my post . You simply assert things without any support . Your analogy is not accurate and your assertions are unsupported . Try this on for size . It is not murder for one Siamese twin to kill the other in the womb . There . We now have equal arguments . But the idea is illogical . For one Siamese twin to kill the other in the womb would likely be to kill itself as well . The systems are dependent on each other for life .

Your argument is from Fantasy Island . Your comparison is a total failure , as I have demonstrated already , and has no basis in reality , neither legally nor medically . And for you to assert that it is not a perfect comparison because of the impossible , that of coercion or oppression , is ridiculous . As I said , you give the analogy too little credit for failure . On the one hand you start this by saying you want to take a real , rather than a hypothetical , situation , then you fly off into Siamese twins murdering one another in the womb or coercing or oppressing each other in the womb when the reality of the situation you describe in now way matches your version . As I said before , decisions are made regarding which twin lives and dies in situations where they can not both survive . And , furthermore , as I have already said , there is a difference between an equal claim to organs and a claim that is unequal . You seem to be asserting that a fetus has a claim on a woman 's womb . When the fetus is born , what happens to its claim ? And by what reason do you assert its claim ? > > > > > 3 ) If a parent has the right to choose to not take responsibility > > > > > for their own child , why are there laws and penalties against > > > > > child abandonment ? > > > > This last question is irrelevant and something of a non sequitur . > > > > Can you establish some relevance or even some sense for it ? > > > If at some point an unborn child is a human being , the parents clearly > > > have the same responsibilities toward her as any other parents have toward > > > their children . > > Again , what is the relevance ?

What happened to that claim to bodily organs where life is at stake ? Why does this parent now have an indisputable right to his or her kidney when previously the parent did not , by your standards ? What is different about the two situations ? I see I have to spell this out for you since the meaning was too subtle for you . In the one case you do not recognize a difference between a fetus and a born child ( you ask why a born child can not be abandoned but a fetus can ) , and in this case you recognize a significant difference between the fetus and born child where the lives of the two are at stake . You ca n't have it both ways . Action and inaction are irrelevant to the principle , but you are wrong about the inaction anyway . Ask any of the numerous women who post here and have borne children how inactive their pregnancy was . To have a healthy , live child , a woman does more than hang out , eat as she chooses , plays volleyball like she always did , drinks at parties with her friends , etc . She behaves very differently , and the provision of her resources to a fetus may be no more voluntary than the beating of her heart , but it is far from inactive . Dean Kaflowitz

From : JEK @ cu.nih.gov Subject : God , morality , and massacres Lines : 258 A listmember ( D Andrew Killie , I think ) wrote , in response to the suggestion that genocide may sometimes be the will of God : > Any God who works that way is indescribably evil , > and unworthy of my worship or faith . Nobuya `` Higgy '' Higashiyama replied ( as , in substance , did others ) : > Where is your source of moral standards by which you judge God's > behavior ? It is often argued that we have no standing by which to judge God's actions . Who is the clay to talk back to the potter ? But we find a contrary view in Scripture . When God proposes to destroy the city of Sodom ( Genesis 18 ) , Abraham says : + Suppose that there are some good men in the city . + Will you destroy the righteous along with the wicked ? + Far be it from you , Lord , to do such a thing ! + Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right ? I am told that the Hebrew is actually a bit stronger than this , and can perhaps be better rendered ( dynamic equivalence ) as + Shame on you , Lord , if you do such a thing ! There are those who say that the definition of `` good '' is `` whatever God happens to want . '' But if that is so , then the statement that God is good has no meaning . It simply says that God does what He wants . That being the case , no one can either love or obey God because He is good . The only motive left for obeying Him is that He is powerful . Just as it makes sense to obey a dictator , even when he tells you to round up all Jews and exterminate them , because if you defy him you might end up in the gas chamber yourself , so it makes sense to obey God , because He has the power to punish you if you do n't . This ethical theory I take to be in radical contradiction to Genesis 18 and to Christianity in general . Any theory that makes our moral judgements worthless makes any further discussion of morality ( or of the goodness of God ) meaningless . However , it does not follow that our moral judgements are always infallible in particular cases , still less our judgements in particular cases about the course of action most likely to achieve a good result . When I read the Scriptural accounts of the actions of God in history , those actions often seem to me very different from what I might expect of a God who loves us and desires what is best for us . Moreover , leaving the Scriptures aside , and considering the natural world , I find that Nature is often very different from what I might expect if it were the work of a benevolent deity . ( Origen said : '' Those who believe that the Author of Nature is also the Author of the Scriptures must expect to find in the Scriptures the same sort of difficulties that they find in Nature . '' ) Now , that some such difficulties should exist is not in itself an argument against the existence , power , wisdom , and goodness of God . On the contrary , their ABSENCE would be such an argument . Suppose that I am watching Bobby Fisher play chess , and suppose that every time he makes a move , I find myself nodding and saying : `` Good move ! Just what I was expecting him to do . Same move I would have made if I were playing . '' That would be a sign that Fisher is no better a chess player than myself . Given that he is better , I expect that at least some of his moves will have me thinking , `` Now , what do suppose induced him to do that ? '' or even , `` Boy , that was a real slip -- he's just thrown the game away ! '' Similarly , if God understands the workings of the universe better than I do , it is to be expected that sometimes it will look to me as if He has made a mistake . One difference between Fisher at the chessboard and God at the controls of the universe is that I can see the end of the chess game . If Fisher wins , I revise my earlier inference that it was carelessness that made him lose his queen 23 moves earlier . However , if he loses , and particularly if I can see that there was a time when he had an opportunity for a checkmate in two moves and did not take it , then I know that he is not as good a player as I had thought . With God , on the other hand , I shall not in this life see the total result of some of His actions . Therefore , my grounds for judging that I have seen a bad move on His part must always be far shakier than my grounds for making a similar judgement about Fisher . ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** In the book of Genesis , we read that Joseph 's ten older brothers , who ( with good reason ) found him insufferable , conspired to sell him into slavery in Egypt . There he eventually became Viceroy , and when there was a famine in Canaan , he was able to provide for his family . When his brothers nervously apologized , he told them : `` Do not worry . You meant to do me evil , but God turned it into good . '' I once heard a rabbi speak on this text . He said : The history of the Jews is largely a history of events that look like catastrophes that threaten the continued survival of the religion , or the people , or both . But , amazingly , those events turn out to be the saving of the Jews and of Judaism . The sale of Joseph by his brothers looked like the breakup of the family . But in fact , it ended with a reconciliation of the quarrel between them . The famine that drove the family out of Canaan looked like a misfortune for them . But in fact , if they had stayed in Canaan , they would almost certainly have intermarried with the Canaanites and been assimilated into their culture . Their oppression by the Egyptians a few generations after their arrival in Egypt again looked like a disaster . But God used it to bring them out of Egypt , and into the Promised Land . Here the people built a Temple , and regularly offered sacrifices . But the Babylonians captured Jerusalem and Judea , destroyed Temple and city and countryside , and deported most of the people to Babylon . You might have thought that that would be the end of the people and the religion . But it was not . Living in Canaan , the people had been under constant danger of assimilation . Again and again , they had turned from the worship of the LORD to the worship of the Canaanite fertility cults , with their ritual prostitution and ritual human sacrifice . The Babylonian captivity put a stop to that . Never again did the Jews show any interest in polytheism or idolatry . Neither the worship of the Canaanites mor that of the Babylonians ever again had a foothold among them . Nor is that all . Judaism had been in danger of becoming simply a system of sacrifices and Temple observances . The only prescribed acts of worship consisted of coming to Jerusalem every so often and offering a sacrifice . During the Captivity , with the Temple gone , the Jews invented the synagogue , a place of meeting for reading and study and discussion of the Scriptures . They came to realize clearly , what they were in danger of forgetting while they continued to live in Judea , that God is not simply a local or tribal deity , not just the controller of the land of Canaan , or the patron of the Jewish people , but the Creator of the world , and the Ruler and Judge of all humans everywhere . Time passed , and the Babylonian Empire was replaced by that of the Persians , and then that of the Greeks , or rather the Macedonians . The ruler , Antiochus Epiphanes , was determined to stamp out Judaism , and to this end he made the reading and the study of the Torah punishable by death . Again , one might think that this would be the end of Judaism . But it was not . The people met for worship , and instead of reading the Torah portion appointed for the day , they would read some passage from the prophets that had a similar theme , and then discuss that . Before this time , the Torah , the so-called Five Books of Moses ( Genesis , Exodus , Leviticus , Numbers , and Deuteronomy ) were the only books read and studied in the synagogue . If it had not been for Antiochus , the books of the prophets would probably have been forgotten altogether . His hatred for Judaism saved them . [ Other examples here omitted for brevity 's sake . ] Some of you may remember that Julie Andrews first became famous as Eliza Doolittle in the stage production of MY FAIR LADY . When Warner Brothers undertook to make a movie of it , everyone expected that Julie , who had been so magnificent on stage , would play the same role in the movie . Instead , the studio decided to go with an established screen star , and cast Audrey Hepburn . Julie Andrews was naturally crushed . But she later realized that if she had played the screen role , she would have been type-cast for life as an Elize Doolittle type . It would have been a disaster for her . As it was , Walt Disney offered her the role of Mary Poppins , and she won an Oscar for it . At the presentation , she stood there , smiling , and looking at Walt Disney , she said , `` And now , my special thanks to the man who made all this possible -- JACK WARNER ! '' It was the most memorable line of the evening . In a similar spirit , we Jews might thank the men who in the providence of God have preserved Judaism , and kept it alive to this day , beginning with Joseph 's brothers , and continuing with two Pharaohs , with Nebuchadnezzar , with Antiochus Epiphanes ... . After the formal meeting had broken up , one woman came up to him privately and said , `` You were talking about the Holocaust , weren't you ? '' He answered , `` If that is an example that came to your mind , then you are right , I was talking about it to you . But I would not talk about it to everyone , for not everyone can bear it . '' I assume that he meant that , without the Holocaust , there would have been no state of Israel . Someone hearing the rabbi 's lecture might leap to the conclusion that God is dependent on the wickedness of men to accomplish His purposes -- or at least that the rabbi thought so . He might then go on to suppose that the wickedness is in fact God 's doing -- that He stirred up Joseph 's brothers to a murderous hate against him , and that when the Israelites were in Egypt , God hardened Pharaoh's heart , so that he oppressed the people , and would not let them go . And this raises questions about how an action can be considered wicked and at the same time be considered something that God has brought about . I suggest another way of looking at it . Consider a sculptor who has a log of wood from which he proposes to carve a statue . But the log , instead of having a smooth even grain throughout , has a large knot that spoils the appearance of the surface . The sculptor considers the wood for a while , and then carves a statue that features the knot , that makes that particular interruption in the grain and color of the wood correspond to some feature of the statue , so that observers will say : `` How fortunate the sculptor was in finding a piece of wood with a knot like that in just the right place . Its presence is the crowning touch , the thing that makes the statue a great work of art . '' In reality , the knot , far from being what the sculptor was looking for , was a challenge to his skill . If the wood had not contained that flaw , he would still have made a great work of art , but a different one . So , if Joseph 's brothers had not sold him , God would still have brought about His purposes for the Jewish people , but He would have done so in another manner . If Judas had not betrayed Jesus , if Caiaphas and his fellow leaders had not rejected Jesus , but had rather acknowledged Him as the Annointed of God , if Pilate had followed his conscience rather than his fears and had set Jesus free , it might appear that there would have been no Crucifixion , and therefore no Redemption , and therefore no Salvation . Not so . God did not need Judas ' sin to redeem us . If Judas had done right , then God in Christ would still have reconciled the world to Himself . We do not know how , just as we do not know how Michelangelo would have painted the Sistine Chapel if its interior had instead been shaped like Grand Central Station , and just as we do not know how Bobby Fisher would have won his fourth game agianst Spassky if Spassky had refused the exchange of bishops and had attacked Fisher 's knight instead ( do n't bother to look up the game in question -- I am making up this example , but the point is none the less valid ) . Thus , we may say both ( 1 ) that God used , say , the cowardice of Pilate to accomplish His purposes , and ( 2 ) that the said cowardice was not God 's doing , and that Pilate would not have thwarted God's plans by behaving justly and courageously . What , then , are we to make of the place where God says to Moses , `` I will harden Pharaoh 's heart , so that he will not let the people go '' ? Some Christians have taken this to mean that Pharaoh was a puppet with God pulling the strings , and that his stubbornness and cruelty were not his own work , but the work of God in him . I suppose rather that what God was telling Moses was something like this : `` If you see that Pharaoh is not willing to let the people go , do not be discouraged , or suppose that the situation is out of my control . My purposes will not be thwarted . If Pharaoh chooses to hear you and let the people go , well and good . If he does not , I will fit his resistance into my plans , and fit it so perfectly that future historians and theologians will suppose that I would have been thrown for a loss if Pharaoh had obeyed me . '' To return to the question that started this all off . Is it possible that the Serbs , in slaughtering the Moslems of Bosnia , are instruments of God 's will ? First point . What they are doing is wrong , just as what Joseph 's brothers did was wrong , just as what Judas did was wrong . They intend it for evil . If God somehow brings good out of it , that does not make them any less subject to just condemnation and punishment . Second point . Of course , God will bring good out of it . But not the same good that He would have brought if the Serbians had refrained from the sins of robbery and rape and murder . Nor does the good He purposes excuse us from the duty of doing what is right . Yours , James Kiefer

What was he killed for . He had n't hurt anyone , had n't said any word he ought n't have . Why did they kill him ? I want to find out -- from here , from there , from the government -- why my husband was killed . On the 27th , when I returned from work -- it was a Saturday -- my son was at home . He does n't work . I went straight to the kitchen , and he called me , `` Mamma , is there a soccer game ? '' There were shouts from Lenin Street . That 's where we lived . I say , `` I do n't know , Igor , I have n't turned on the TV . '' He looked again and said , `` Mamma , what 's going on in the courtyard ? ! '' I look and see so many people , it 's awful , marching , marching , there are hundreds , thousands , you ca n't even tell how many there are . They 're shouting , `` Down with the Armenians ! Kill the Armenians ! Tear the Armenians to pieces ! '' My God , why is that happening , what for ? I had known nothing at that point . We lived together well , in friendship , and suddenly something like this . It was completely unexpected . And they were shouting , `` Long live Turkey ! '' And they had flags , and they were shouting . There was a man walking in front well dressed , he 's around 40 or 45 , in a gray raincoat . He is walking and saying something , I ca n't make it out through the vent window . He is walking and saying something , and the children behind him are shouting , `` Tear the Armenians to pieces ! '' and '' Down with the Armenians ! '' They shout it again , and then shout , `` Hurrah ! '' The people streamed without end , they were walking in groups , and in the groups I saw that there were women , too . I say , `` My God , there are women there too ! '' And my son says , `` Those are n't women , Mamma , those are bad women . '' Well we did n't look a long time . They were walking and shouting and I was afraid , I simply could n't sit still . I went out onto the balcony , and my Azerbaijani neighbor is on the other balcony , and I say , `` Khalida , what 's going on , what happened ? '' She says , `` Emma , I do n't know , I do n't know , I do n't know what happened . '' Well she was quite frightened too . They had these white sticks , each second or third one had a white rod . They 're waving the rods above their heads as they walk , and the one who 's out front , like a leader , he has a white stick too . Well maybe it was an armature shaft , but what I saw was white , I do n't know . My husband got home 10 or 15 minutes later . He comes home and I say , `` Oh dear , I 'm frightened , they 're going to kill us I bet . '' And he says , `` What are you afraid of , they 're just children . '' I say , `` Everything that happens comes from children . '' There had been 15- and 16-year kids from the Technical and Vocational School . `` Do n't fear , '' he said , `` it 's nothing , nothing all that bad . '' He did n't eat , he just lay on the sofa . And just then on television they broadcast that two Azerbaijanis had been killed in Karabakh , near Askeran . When I heard that I could n't settle down at all , I kept walking here and there and I said , `` They 're going to kill us , the Azerbaijanis are going to kill us . '' And he says , `` Do n't be afraid . '' Then we heard -- from the central square , there are women shouting near near the stage , well , they 're shouting different things , and you could n't hear every well . I say , `` You speak Azerbaijani well , listen to what they 're saying . '' He says `` Close the window and go to bed , there s nothing happening there . '' He listened a bit and then closed the window and went to bed , and told us , `` Come on , go to sleep , it's nothing . '' Sleep , what did he mean sleep ? My Son and I stood at the window until two in the morning watching . Well he 's sick , and all of this was affecting him . I say , `` Igor , you go to bed , I 'm going to go to bed in a minute too . '' He went and I sat at the window until three , and then went to bed . Things had calmed down slightly . The 28th , Sunday , was my day off . My husband got up and said , `` Come on , Emma , get up . '' I say , `` Today 's my day off , let me rest . '' He says , `` Are n't you going to make me some tea ? '' Well I felt startled and got up , and said , `` Where are you going ? '' He says , `` I 'm going out , I have to . '' I say , `` Can you really go outside on a day like today ? Do n't go out , for God 's sake . You never listen to me , I know , and you 're not going to listen to me now , but at least do n't take the car out of the garage , go without the car . '' And he says , `` Come on , close the door ! '' And then on the staircase he muttered something , I could n't make it out , he probably said `` coward '' or something . I closed the door and he left . And I started cleaning . . . picking things up around the house . . . Everything seemed quiet until one o'clock in the after- noon , but at the bus station , my neighbor told me , cars were burning . I said , '' Khalida , was it our car ? '' She says , `` No , no , Emma , do n't be afraid , they were government cars and Zhigulis . '' Our car is a GAZ-21 Volga . And I waited , it was four o'clock , five o'clock . . . and when he was n't home at seven I said , `` Oh , they 've killed Shagen ! '' Tires are burning in town , there 's black smoke in town , and I 'm afraid , I 'm standing on the balcony and I 'm all . . . my whole body is shaking . My God , they 've probably killed him ! So basically I waited like that until ten o'clock and he still had n't come home . And I 'm afraid to go out . At ten o'clock I look out : across from our building is a building with a bookstore , and from upstairs , from the second floor , everything is being thrown outside . I 'm looking out of one window and Igor is looking out of the other , and I do n't want him to see this , and he , as it turns out , does n't want me to see it . We wanted to hide it from one another . I joined him . `` Mamma , '' he says , '' look what they 're doing over there ! '' They were burning everything , and there were police standing there , 10 or 15 of them , maybe twenty policemen standing on the side , and the crowd is on the other side , and two or three people are throwing everything down from the balcony . And one of the ones on the balcony is shouting , `` What are you standing there for , burn it ! '' When they threw the television , wow , it was like a bomb ! Our neighbor on the third floor came out on her balcony and shouted , `` Why are you doing that , why are you burning those things , those people saved with such difficulty to buy those things for their home . Why are you burning them ? '' And from the courtyard they yell at her , `` Go inside , go inside ! Instead why do n't you tell us if they are any of them in your building or not ? '' They meant Armenians , but they did n't say Armenians , they said , `` of them . '' She says , `` No , no , no , none ! '' Then she ran downstairs to our place , and says , `` Emma , Emma , you have to leave ! '' I say , `` They 've killed Shagen anyway , what do we have to live for ? It wo n't be living for me without Shagen . Let them kill us , too ! '' She insists , saying , `` Emma , get out of here , go to Khalida 's , and give me the key . When they come I 'll say that it 's my daughter 's apartment , that they 're off visiting someone . '' I gave her the key and went to the neighbor 's , but I could n't endure it . I say , `` Igor , you stay here , I 'm going to go downstairs , and see , maybe Papa 's . . . Papa 's there . '' Meanwhile , they were killing the two brothers , Alik and Valery [ Albert and Valery Avanesians ; see the accounts of Rima Avanesian and Alvina Baluian ] , in the courtyard . There is a crowd near the building , they 're shouting , howling , and I did n't think that they were killing at the time . Alik and Valery lived in the corner house across from ours . When I went out into the courtyard I saw an Azerbaijani , our neighbor , a young man about 30 years old . I say , `` Madar , Uncle Shagen 's gone , let 's go see , maybe he 's dead in the garage or near the garage , let 's at least bring the corpse into the house . `` He shouts , `` Aunt Emma , where do you think you 're going ? ! Go back into the house , I 'll look for him . '' I say , `` Something will happen to you , too , because of me , no , Madar , I 'm coming too . '' Well he would n't let me go all the same , he says , `` You stay here with us , I 'm go look . '' He went and looked , and came back and said , `` Aunt Emma , there 's no one there , the garage is closed . `` Madar went off again and then returned and said , `` Aunt Emma , they 're already killed Alik , and Valery 's there . . . wheezing . '' Madar wanted to go up to him , but those scoundrels said , `` Do n't go near him , or we 'll put you next to him . '' He got scared -- he 's young -- and came back and said , `` I 'm going to go call , maybe an ambulance will come , at least to take Alik , maybe he 'll live . . . `` They grew up together in our courtyard , they knew each other well , they had always been on good terms . He went to call , but not a single telephone worked , they had all been shut off . He called , and called , and called , and called -- nothing . I went upstairs to the neighbor 's . Igor says , `` Two police cars drove up over there , their headlights are on , but they 're not touching them , they are still lying where they were , they 're still lying there . . . `` We watched out the window until four o'clock , and then went downstairs to our apartment . I didn't take my clothes off . I lay on the couch so as not to go to bed , and at six o'clock in the morning I got up and said , `` Igor , you stay here at home , don't go out , do n't go anywhere , I 'm going to look , I have to find Papa , dead or alive . . . let me go . . . I 've got the keys from work . '' At six o'clock I went to the Emergency Hospital . The head doctor and another doctor opened the door to the morgue . I run up to them and say , `` Doctor , is Shagen there ? '' He says , `` What do you mean ? Why should Shagen be here ? ! '' I wanted to go in , but he would n't let me . There were only four people in there , they said . Well , they must have been awful because they did n't let me in . They said , `` Shagen 's not here , he 's alive somewhere , he 'll come back . '' It 's already seven o'clock in the morning . I look and there is a panel truck with three policemen . Some of our people from the hospital were there with them . I say , `` Sara Baji [ `` Sister '' Sara , term of endearment ] , go look , they've probably brought Shagen . '' I said it , shouted it , and she went and came back and says , `` No , Emma , he has tan shoes on , it 's a younger person . '' Now Shagen just happened to have tan shoes , light tan , they were already old . When they said it like that I guessed immediately . I went and said , `` Doctor , they 've brought Shagen in dead . '' He says , `` Why are you carrying on like that , dead , dead . . . he 's alive . '' But then he went all the same , and when he came back the look on his face was . . . I could tell immediately that he was dead . They knew one another well , Shagen had worked for him a long time . I say , `` Doctor , is it Shagen ? '' He says , `` No , Emma , it 's not he , it 's somebody else entirely . '' I say , `` Doctor , why are you deceiving me , I 'll find out all the same anyway , if not today , then tomorrow . '' And he said . . . I screamed , right there in the office . He says , `` Emma , go , go calm down a little . '' Another one of our colleagues said that the doctor had said it was Shagen , but . . . in hideous condition . They tried to calm me down , saying it was n't Shagen . A few minutes later another colleague comes in and says , `` Oh , poor Emma ! '' When she said it like that there was no hope left . That day was awful . They were endlessly bringing in dead and injured people . At night someone took me home . I said , `` Igor , Papa 's been killed . '' On the morning of the 1st I left Igor at home again and went to the hospital : I had to bury him somehow , do something . I look and see that the hospital is surrounded by soldiers . They are wearing dark clothes . `` Hey , citizen , where are you going ? '' I say , `` I work here , '' and from inside someone shouts , `` Yes , yes , that 's our cook , let her in . '' I went right to the head doctor 's office and there is a person from the City Health Department there , he used to work with us at the hospital . He says , `` Emma , Shagen 's been taken to Baku . In the night they took the wounded and the dead , all of them , to Baku . '' I say , `` Doctor , how will I bury him ? '' He says , `` We 're taking care of all that , do n't you worry , we 'll do everything , we 'll tell you about it . Where did you spend the night ? '' I say , `` I was at home . '' He says , `` What do you mean you were at home ? ! You were at home alone ? '' I say , `` No , Igor was there too . '' He says , `` You ca n't stay home , we 're getting an ambulance right now , wait just one second , the head doctor is coming , we 're arranging an ambulance right now , you put on a lab coat and take one for Igor , you go and bring Igor here like a patient , and you 'll stay here and we 'll se~ later what to do next ... '' His last name is Kagramanov . The head doctor 's name is Izyat Jamalogli Sadukhov . The `` ambulance '' arrived and I went home and got Igor . They admitted him as a patient , they gave us a private room , an isolation room . We stayed in the hospital until the 4th . Some police car came and they said , `` Emma , let 's go . '' And the women , our colleagues , then they saw the police car , became anxious and said , `` Where are you taking her ? '' I say , `` They 're going to kill me , too . . . `` And the investigator says , `` Why are you saying that , we 're going to make a positive identification . '' We went to Baku and they took me into the morgue . . . I still ca n't remember what hospital it was . . . The investigator says , `` Let 's go , we need to be certain , maybe it 's not Shagen . '' And when I saw the caskets , lying on top of one another , I went out of my mind . I say , `` I ca n't look , no . '' The investigator says , `` Are there any identifying marks ? '' I say , `` Let me see the clothes , or the shoes , or even a sock , I 'll recognize them . '' He says , '' Is n't they 're anything on his body ? '' I say he has seven gold teeth and his finger , he only has half of one of his fingers . Shagen was a carpenter , he had been injured at work . . . They brought one of the sleeves of the shirt and sweater he was wearing , they brought them and they were all burned . . . When I saw them I shouted , `` Oh , they burned him ! '' I shouted , I do n't know , I fell down . . . or maybe I sat down , I do n't remember . And that investigator says , `` Well fine , fine , since we 've identified that these are his clothes , and since his teeth . . . since he has seven gold teeth . . . `` On the 4th they told me : `` Emma , it 's time to bury Shagen now . '' I cried , `` How , how can I bury Shagen when I have only one son and he 's sick ? I should inform his relatives , he has three sisters , I ca n't do it by myself . '' They say , `` OK , you know the situation . How will they get here from Karabagh ? How will they get here from Yerevan ? There 's no transportation , it s impossible . '' He was killed on February 28 , and I buried him on March 7 . We buried him in Sumgait . They asked me , `` Where do you want to bury him ? '' I said , `` I want to bury him in Karabagh , where we were born , let me bury him in Karabagh , '' I 'm shouting , and the head of the burial office , I guess , says , `` Do you know what it means , take him to Karabagh ? ! It means arson ! '' I say , `` What do you mean , arson ? Do n't they know what 's going on in Karabagh ? The whole world knows that they killed them , and I want to take him to Karabagh , I do n't have anyone anymore . '' I begged , I pleaded , I grieved , I even got down on my knees . He says , `` Let 's bury him here now , and in three months , in six months , a year , if it calms down , I 'll help you move him to Karabagh . . . `` Our trial was the first in Sumgait . It was concluded on May 16 . At the investigation the murderer , Tale Ismailov , told how it all happened , but then at the trial he . . . tried to wriggle . . . he tried to soften his crime . Then they brought a videotape recorder , I guess , and played it , and said , '' Ismailov , look , is that you ? '' He says , `` Yes . '' `` Well look , here you 're describing everything as it was on the scene of the crime , right ? '' He says , '' Yes . '' `` And now you 're telling it differently ? '' He says , `` Well maybe I forgot ! '' Like that . The witnesses and that criminal creep himself said that when the car was going along Mir Street , there was a crowd of about 80 people . . . Shagen had a Volga GAZ-21 . The 80 people surrounded his car , and all 80 of them were involved . One of them was this Ismailov guy , this Tale . They -- it 's unclear who -- started pulling Shagen out of the car . Well , one says from the left side of the car , another says from the right side . They pulled off his sports jacket . He had a jacket on . Well they ask him , `` What 's your nationality ? '' He says , `` Armenian . '' Well they say from the crowd they shouted , `` If he 's an Armenian , kill him , kill him ! '' They started beating him , they broke seven of his ribs , and his heart . . . I do n't know , they did something there , too . . . it 's too awful to tell about . Anyway , they say this Tale guy . . . he had an armature shaft . He says , `` I picked it up , it was lying near a bush , that 's where I got it . '' He said he picked it up , but the witnesses say that he had already had it . He said , `` I hit him twice , '' he said , `` . . . once or twice on the head with that rod . '' And he said that when he started to beat him Shagen was sitting on the ground , and when he hit him he fell over . He said , '' I left , right nearby they were burning things or something in an apartment , killing someone , '' he says , `` and I came back to look , is that Shagen alive or not ? '' I said , `` You wanted to finish him , right , and if he was still alive , you came back to hit him again ? '' He went back and looked and he was already dead . `` After that , '' that bastard Tale said , `` after that I went home . '' I said , `` You . . . you . . . little snake , '' I said , `` Are you a thief and a murderer ? '' Shagen had had money in his jacket , and a watch on his wrist . They were taken . He says he did n't take them When they overturned and burned the car , that Tale was no longer there , it was other people who did that . Who it was , who turned over the car and who burned it , that has n't been clarified as yet . I told the investigator , `` How can you have the trial when you do n't know who burned the car ? '' He said something , but I did n't get what he was saying . But I said , `` You still have n't straightened everything out , I think that 's unjust . '' When they burned the car he was lying next to it , and the fire spread to him . In the death certificate it says that he had third-degree burns over 80 percent of his body . . . And I ask again , why was he killed ? My husband was a carpenter ; he was a good craftsman , he knew how to do everything , he even fixed his own car , with his own hands . We have three children . Three sons . Only Igor was with me at the time . The older one was in Pyatigorsk , and the younger one is serving in the Army . And now they 're fatherless ... I could n't sit all the way through it . When the Procurator read up to 15 years ' deprivation of freedom , I just . . . I went out of my mind , I didn't know what to do with myself , I said , `` How can that be ? You , '' I said , `` you are saying that it was intentional murder and the sentence is 15 years ' deprivation of freedom ? '' I screamed , I had my mind ! I said , `` Let me at that creep , with my bare hands I 'll . . . `` A relative restrained me , and there were all those military people there . . . I lest . I said , '' This is n't a Soviet trial , this is unjust ! '' That 's what I shouted , l said it and left . . . I said that on February 27 , when those people were streaming down our street , they were shouting , `` Long live Turkey ! '' and `` Glory to Turkey ! '' And during the trial I said to that Ismailov , `` What does that mean , 'Glory to Turkey ' ? '' I still do n't understand what Turkey has to do with this , we live in the Soviet Union . That Turkey told you to or is going to help you kill Armenians ? I still do n't understand why `` Glory to Turkey ! '' I asked that question twice and got no answer . . . No one answered me . . .

Battery powered devices like the PowerBook are sometimes more sensitive to serial port weirdness . I had trouble with connecting my Mac Plus to an HP 95LX handheld . Everything else worked okay on that port , but not the HP . ( it runs on two penlite batteries ) . It turned out that the plus ( by accident or by design flaw ? ) was putting a 4 volt bias on the serial port that was doing weird things to the HP ( which has only 3v dc ! ) . The HP worked fine when connected to the printer port . Does your PB screen get dim or anything when connected to the device ? Have you tried using the printer port ?

From : jerryb @ eskimo.com ( Jerry Kaufman ) Subject : Re : Questions from a newbie Organization : - > ESKIMO NORTH ( 206 ) For-Ever < - Lines : 27 The concept of God as a teacher is indeed interesting . Does He grade on a curve , does He cheat ? That is interesting . Not to mention thought provoking . My own concept is that He is a Father and we are His children . In that He loves us , with a love that we can never understand until we are with Him . The Bible says that He looks on the heart as the final measure . From that perspective , in a grading context , the heart is the final test . Specifically , most Christians would agree that there is only one Heaven and one Hell . From that perspective , it is Heaven or Hell . You either go to one or the other . The `` grading '' on a pass/fail basis is done by God the Father with intervention by Jesus the Son . Not by others . For only God sees the heart . The Bible says of the heart , `` ... who can know it . '' I would say there has always been , and always be , an unchanging method . That is what makes a relationship with Christ so secure . In an uncertain and ever changing landscape He is always the same . Yesterday , today and tomorrow . Concerning whether or not our childhoods are considerd as part of the test , my own conviction is no . Were that the case I certainly would n't be going to Heaven . The Bible speaks very plainly about the love and care Jesus had for and about children . The reality is that we are all children . Some of us just have bigger bodies and grey hair . But the Father , our Father is always there . Like most Fathers He wants only the best for His own . There maybe decipline , but there is more love . It 's sometimes looks like Christianity is a test , to see who makes it and who does n't . Those who do pass=Heaven , and those who do n't go to the other place . But it is really much more than that ... There are few experts . Most of us are just travelers looking for the light and the way Home . Praying that we can bring others with us .

RK makes radial cuts around the circumference of the cornea , up to 8 I think , and these change the curvature of the cornea through stress chages .

We 'll let you live , but just this once ... . There 's more to a real `` storage '' scope than just a long-persistence phosphor . Actually , the phosphor IS N'T usually anything special at all ; what makes a storage tube work is a screen placed just *behind* the phosphor , which becomes charged as the electron beam intially `` writes '' the trace . With the trace now written to the screen , a separate low-level `` flood '' electron gun keeps the image lit by exciting those areas of phosphor which are next to the `` written '' areas on the storage screen . There are some problems with this - the resolution is limited compared to a non-storage tube , and the stored trace tends to `` bloom '' with time .

From : kadie @ cs.uiuc.edu ( Carl M Kadie ) Subject : [ EFF ] Initial EFF Analysis of Clinton Privacy and Security Proposal Organization : University of Illinois , Dept . of Comp . Sci. , Urbana , IL Lines : 107 [ An article from comp.org.eff.news , EFFector Online 5.06 - Carl ] April 16 , 1993 INITIAL EFF ANALYSIS OF CLINTON PRIVACY AND SECURITY PROPOSAL The Clinton Administration today made a major announcement on cryptography policy which will effect the privacy and security of millions of Americans . The first part of the plan is to begin a comprehensive inquiry into major communications privacy issues such as export controls which have effectively denied most people easy access to robust encryption as well as law enforcement issues posed by new technology . However , EFF is very concerned that the Administration has already reached a conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry , before any public comment or discussion has been allowed . Apparently , the Administration is going to use its leverage to get all telephone equipment vendors to adopt a voice encryption standard developed by the National Security Agency . The so-called `` Clipper Chip '' is an 80-bit , split key escrowed encryption scheme which will be built into chips manufactured by a military contractor . Two separate escrow agents would store users ' keys , and be required to turn them over law enforcement upon presentation of a valid warrant . The encryption scheme used is to be classified , but they chips will be available to any manufacturer for incorporation into their communications products . This proposal raises a number of serious concerns . First , the Administration appears to be adopting a solution before conducting an inquiry . The NSA-developed Clipper chip may not be the most secure product . Other vendors or developers may have better schemes . Furthermore , we should not rely on the government as the sole source for Clipper or any other chips . Rather , independent chip manufacturers should be able to produce chipsets based on open standards . Second , an algorithm can not be trusted unless it can be tested . Yet the Administration proposes to keep the chip algorithm classified . EFF believes that any standard adopted ought to be public and open . The public will only have confidence in the security of a standard that is open to independent , expert scrutiny . Third , while the use of the split-key , dual-escrowed system may prove to be a reasonable balance between privacy and law enforcement needs , the details of this scheme must be explored publicly before it is adopted . What will give people confidence in the safety of their keys ? Does disclosure of keys to a third party waive individual 's fifth amendment rights in subsequent criminal inquiries ? In sum , the Administration has shown great sensitivity to the importance of these issues by planning a comprehensive inquiry into digital privacy and security . However , the `` Clipper chip '' solution ought to be considered as part of the inquiry , not be adopted before the discussion even begins . DETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL : ESCROW The 80-bit key will be divided between two escrow agents , each of whom hold 40 bits of each key . Upon presentation of a valid warrant , the two escrow agents would have to turn the key parts over to law enforcement agents . Most likely the Attorney General will be asked to identify appropriate escrow agents . Some in the Administration have suggested one non-law enforcement federal agency , perhaps the Federal Reserve , and one non-governmental organization . But , there is no agreement on the identity of the agents yet . Key registration would be done by the manufacturer of the communications device . A key is tied to the device , not to the person using it . CLASSIFIED ALGORITHM AND THE POSSIBILITY OF BACK DOORS The Administration claims that there are no back door means by which the government or others could break the code without securing keys from the escrow agents and that the President will be told there are no back doors to this classified algorithm . In order to prove this , Administration sources are interested in arranging for an all-star crypto cracker team to come in , under a security arrangement , and examine the algorithm for trap doors . The results of the investigation would then be made public . GOVERNMENT AS MARKET DRIVER In order to get a market moving , and to show that the government believes in the security of this system , the feds will be the first big customers for this product . Users will include the FBI , Secret Service , VP Al Gore , and maybe even the President . FROM MORE INFORMATION CONTACT : Jerry Berman , Executive Director Daniel J.

From : Desiree_Bradley @ mindlink.bc.ca ( Desiree Bradley ) Subject : Doing the work of God ? ? ! ! ) Organization : MIND LINK ! - British Columbia , Canada Lines : 33 As our local.religion.christian BBS group seems moribund , I 'm posting here . On one of the Sundays just before Easter I went to church . The sermon was based on a story in the Book of Joshua . ( The one about Joshua sending out spies to the land he was planning to take ) What I particularly remember , because of having heard part of a CBC radio documentary on Bosnia , was that the Rahab ( the woman who sheltered the spies ) said that the people were '' melting in fear . '' What with having heard that CBC radio documentary and knowing that the Muslims in Bosnia were losing the war , I felt uncomfortable . After all , the Serbs are driving non-Christians out . On the other hand , ministers do say that the Bible is opposed to the values held by our secular society . Anyhow members of that church are involved in out-of-country missionary work . Also , the pastor has talked of spiritual warfare and of bringing Christ to the nonreligious people of our area . The next Sunday , the sermon was about Joshua 6 ( where the Israelites take Jericho and then proceed to massacre everybody there -- - except for Rahab , who had sheltered the spies ) . With those reports about Bosnia in my mind , I felt uncomfortable about the minister saying that the massacre ( the one in Joshua ) was right . But what really bothered me was that , if I was going to try taking Christianity seriously , I should n't be so troubled about the reports of `` ethnic cleansing '' in Bosnia . Certainly , my sympathies should n't be with the Moslims . Considering that the Bosnian Muslims are descendants of Christians who , under Turkish rule , converted to Islam could the Serbs be doing God 's work ? [ The example of God 's people setting out on bloody wars of conquest has always been troubling in discussions here . I personally question whether they were right even at the time . But those who believe they were consider that the wars were justified only because they were specifically commanded by God . Somehow I do n't see the Serbs behaving like a group that is led by God in this matter . -- clh ]

I ca n't imagine the FAA allowing > people to shoot rockets up through the flight levels of passenger planes . > Not to even mention the problem of locating a rocket when it comes down . Nope , it 's not illegal . It is , however , closely regulated . In order to purchase and use the big rocket motors required , it is necessary to be one of the following : a ) An employee of a government agency . b ) An employee or student at a university doing research involving rockets . c ) A member or representative of an educational organization involved in research or other uses of rockets . There are two such organizations : The Tripoli Rocketry Association and the National Association of Rocketry . Members of either organization must demonstrate proficiency in construction and flight before they are allowed to purchase large motors on their own . The FAA will issue a waiver of its regulations , upon request , to any organization which can persuade them it has taken adequate precautions to avoid conflicts with aircraft . The usual stipulations are : - Only operation up to a specified ceiling is allowed . Depending on the location , this ceiling may be from 5000 to 50000 feet AGL . - The operator of the rocket is responsible for avoiding any aircraft within the operating radius around the launch site . - Flight into clouds or beyond visual range in haze is expressly prohibited . - The FAA will provide a NOTAM informing other users of the airspace that unmanned rocket operations are taking place at the specified place and time . Most of the launches that are held ( and there are dozens of them every year ) are held in areas where air traffic is relatively light , such as over the western deserts ( the Black Rock Desert north of Reno is particularly popular since it is 25 x 150 miles of *nothing to hit* on the ground ) . The two rocketry associations test and approve motors for their members' use , to insure safety . Depending on motor size , the launcher setback is from 50 to 500 or more feet . By the way , rockets under 1 lb and powered by an `` F '' motor are exempt from most Federal regulations on unmanned rockets anyway . See FAR 101 , Subpart C , for details . As for recovery ... although the higher altitude rockets can reach up to 50,000 feet , most of them only get to 2,000 to 5,000 feet . The typical rocket is 2 to 6 inches in diameter , and carries a 3 to 6 foot parachute , or multiple parachutes , depending on the payload . Many rockets also carry either a small transmitter or an audio sounder -- particularly at launches in the eastern US , where there are more obstructions . Camera , telemetry transmitter , and video payloads are becoming quite common . > And no , I 'm not going to even think of buying one . I 'm not that crazy . Why not ? It 's a lot of fun ... check out the traffic on rec.models.rockets for information about the model ( 3 lb and under ) and high power ( everything bigger ) rocket hobbies . As with all dangerous activities , the key is to practice safety .

Actually , Swedish coach Curt Lundmark is thinking about leaving two spots open for additions from eliminated NHLers .

I must respectfully disagree with this assertion , Brad . The government is notoriously sloppy with physical , communications , and information security . They ca n't keep their computers safe , and they 're `` trying '' . Read `` DEA is Not Adequately Protecting National Security Information '' [ GAO/IMTEC 92-31 ] for an excellent example of what I 'm talking about . Private sector organizations tend to be even more lax in their security measures . I believe that the escrow organizations will be penetrated by foreign intelligence services within months , if not weeks , of their selection . Private organizations that lack the resources of a full-fleged intelligence service will take longer - perhaps on the order of one to two years . Nonetheless , the penetrations will take place , without question . Philip R. Moyer ECN Software Staff Engineering Computer Network Voice : 317-494-3648 prm @ ecn.purdue.edu Fax : 317-494-6440

The only reference is to information already in the hands of others . The 'unauthorized release ' bit is also drawing a long bow . Most of these cases are by people who have legitimate access abusing it , and revealing , or often selling the info . These people are , of course , in this proposal , the people who will have the keys . The criminals also use lawers , courts , the CIA , white-house officials and pens to go about their business . When will they be outlawed as well ? Yeah , several of them would be a better idea than CLipper ! Them again , the protections of law and the courts have been seriously erroded over the last decade ofr so . > A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the `` Clipper Chip '' has > been developed by government engineers .

The case record seems to indicate that what is needed is a brutal tightening of the current abuses .

Lets run that line twice . Not **VERY** carefully what it says . The stated purpose of the key eschrow is to make the use of Clipper compulsory . Note the word `` ensure '' . As to 'protect ' , or 'law-abiding ' , I will leave to you . So to the person who asked if it included the outlawing of other encryptions , the answer in this press release is , YES . > ...

The 'false tension ' is false . The balance is between two repugnant points . The RIGHT to privacy is hand-waved to non-existance by putting it behind the `` false assessment '' . It is assumed that the removal of the right to take what ever steps YOU deem suitable to protect YOUR privacy is non negotiable , hence is defined in the govenment language to be non-existant .

Do I have to be the one to say it ? DO N'T BE SO STUPID AS TO LEAVE YOUR HELMET ON THE SEAT WHERE IT CAN FALL DOWN AND GO BOOM ! That kind of fall is what the helmet is designed to protect against . If you fall with the helmet on and you hit the same spot the helmet landed on during the drop , the helmet may not protect your head as well as it was intended to do . Conservative rec.moto'ers will recommend that you replace the helmet . If you want to be sure that it will protect you adequately , you should . HELMETS GO ON THE GROUND , ON A TABLE , ON A CHAIR , ON A SHELF , OR ON ANY OTHER SURFACE THAT IS LARGE ENOUGH TO SUPPORT THEM SO THAT THEY WILL NOT EASILY BE KNOCKED DOWN . Jeezus .

I 'm not sure of the basis of the belief , but it was a widely held belief among the laity of the RC church and their support of it lead to it being declared to be true . Basically the teaching on infallibility holds that the pope is infallible in matters of faith and doctrine , the college of bishops is likewise infallible , and the laity is as well . The pope gets most of the attention/criticism but the consensus of the other bodies is equally infallible ( according to RC teaching ) . Joe Moore

In fact I believe home medical tests and certain basic tests for serious diseases such as cancer , heart disease , should be offered free to the American public .

Here is the original ANNOUNCEMENT : HISTORY The University of Lowell , supported by a grant of the Open Software Foundation , has developed a wrapper-library , that encapsulates Motif widgets in C++ classes . All resources of these Widgets can now be set through member-functions , while objects can be used in callback-functions . The library was made available for free or nominal cost for anonymous ftp at 129.63.1.1 . However , the library contained a large number of bugs and oversights , and only worked under X11R3 . Due to lack of subsequent fundings , the bindings are no longer actively supported by the University of Lowell . I , Ronald van Loon , at a certain point last year , have taken the Lowell bindings , fixing the bugs I came across , adding missing memberfunctions , and enhancing functionality and made the bug-fixed library available for the general public for anonymous ftp ( made possible by Rick Murphy at DEC ) . NEW RELEASE I am now pleased to announce a new and updated release of the Motif++ bindings . This release offers : - Full Motif1.1 and X11R4 support - Support for Xbae widgetset - Two additional widgets , written by myself , that can be used to indicate progress in an application . - Imake support . NB : this release relies heavily on the existence of imake and its config files on your site . I have tried to provide the bindings with a standard Makefile , tweakable for those unfortunates without imake . I have not severely tested the standard Makefile though . Contact me if you have problems . The reason for calling this a gamma release lies in the fact that I do not have a multitude of platforms to test the Imake-files on . - Lots of testfiles ( even somewhat useful programs ) - An article I wrote on the usage of Motif , X and C++ , previously posted on Usenet . WHERE TO GET THE NEW MOTIF BINDINGS Ftp : Anonymous ftp at decuac.dec.com ( 192.5.214.1 ) , directory /pub/X11 . Note : Please be patient as the network link is quite slow . Please do not FTP large files during working hours . Also note that there is also a motif++.31.jan.92.tar.Z file at this site ; this is an old version of the bindings . E-mail : Those who do n't have ftp can send me e-mail , and I will send the bindings by e-mail . REQUEST Those who use the bindings and find bugs , or see room for improvement , please contact me , and I will try to incorporate them in a future release ( in case of bugs , a bug-fix of course ; - ) . MORE INFORMATION Contact me at `` rvloon @ cv.ruu.nl '' . If you are desperate , then you can call me at +31 30 506711 ( that is Utrecht , the Netherlands ; those within the Netherlands call 030-506711 ) .

RPN : AIAA PAPER 90-1343 Distributions of orbital debris versus height and scattering cross section are determined from a series of observations made with a high- power VHF Doppler radar ( MU radar ) of Japan . An automated data processing algorithm has been developed to discriminate echoes of orbiting objects from those of undesired signals such as meteor trail echoes or lightning atmospherics . Although the results are preliminary , they showed good agreement with those from NORAD tracking radar < -- -- observations using a much higher frequency . It is found that the < -- -- collision frequency of a Space Station of 1 km x 1 km size at an altitude of 500 km with orbiting debris is expected to be as high as once per two years .

Radio Atmospheric Science Center . In International Council of Scientific Unions , Middle Atmosphere Program . Handbook for MAP , Vol . 20 5 p Publication Date : Jun . 1986 As the first attempt among MST ( mesosphere stratosphere troposphere ) type radars , the MU ( middle and upper atmosphere ) radar features an active phased array system . Unlike the conventional large VHF radars , in which output power of a large vacuum tube is distributed to individual antenna elements , each of 475 solid state power amplifier feeds each antenna element . This system configuration enables very fast beam steering as well as various flexible operations by dividing the antenna into independent subarrays , because phase shift and signal division/combination are performed at a low signal level using electronic devices under control of a computer network . The antenna beam can be switched within 10 microsec to any direction within the zenith angle of 30 deg . Since a precise phase alignment of each element is crucial to realize the excellent performance of this system , careful calibration of the output phase of each power amplifier and antenna element was carried out . Among various aircraft which may be used for this purpose artificial satellites have an advantage of being able to make a long term monitoring with the same system . An antenna pattern monitoring system for the MU radar was developed using the scientific satellite OHZORA ( EXOS-C ) . A receiver named MUM ( MU radar antenna Monitor ) on board the satellite measures a CW signal of 100 to 400 watts transmitted from the MU radar . The principle of the measurement and results are discussed .

A large clear air radar with the sensitivity of an incoherent scatter radar for observing the whole equatorial atmosphere up to 1000 km altitude is now being designed in Japan . The radar will be built in Pontianak , West Kalimantan , Indonesia ( 0.03 deg N , 109.29 deg E ) . The system is a 47-MHz monostatic Doppler radar with an active phased array configuration similar to that of the MU radar in Japan , which has been in successful operation since 1983 . It will have a PA product of about 3 x 10 to the 9th W sq m ( P = average transmitter power , A = effective antenna aperture ) with a sensitivity of approximately 10 times that of the MU radar . This system configuration enables pulse-to-pulse beam steering within 20 deg from the zenith . As is the case of the MU radar , a variety of operations will be made feasible under the supervision of the radar controller . A brief description of the system configuration is presented .

April 23 , 1993 ( Phone : 202/358-1780 ) Kyle Herring Johnson Space Center , Houston ( Phone : 713/483-5111 ) RELEASE : 93-76 HUBBLE TELESCOPE SERVICING MISSION SCHEDULED FOR ELEVEN DAYS The December flight of Endeavour on Space Shuttle mission STS-61 to service the Hubble Space Telescope ( HST ) has been scheduled as an 11 day mission designed to accommodate a record five spacewalks with the capability for an additional two , if needed . The decision to schedule five extravehicular activities , or EVAs , was reached following extensive evaluations of underwater training , maneuver times required using the Shuttle 's robot arm based on software simulations and actual EVA tasks on previous missions . `` Basically what we 've done by going to five EVAs rather than three is to repackage our margin so that we have the capability to respond to the dynamics , or unknowns , of spacewalks , '' Mission Director Randy Brinkley said . `` It improves the probabilities for mission success while providing added flexibility and adaptability for reacting to real-time situations . '' In laying out the specific tasks to be completed on each of the spacewalks , officials have determined that changing out the gyros , solar arrays and the Wide Field/Planetary Camera ( WF/PC ) and installing the Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement ( COSTAR ) are priority objectives during the mission . `` When we looked at accomplishing all of the tasks , highest through lowest priority , and recognizing that the major tasks -- gyros , solar arrays , WF/PC and COSTAR -- would consume most of the time set aside for each spacewalk , five EVAs were deemed appropriate , '' said Milt Heflin , Lead Flight Director for the mission . While the five spacewalks will be unprecedented , the use of two alternating spacewalk teams will alleviate placing more stress on the crew than previous missions requiring two , three or four EVAs . `` We have paid close attention to lessons learned during previous spacewalks and factored these into our timeline estimates for five EVAs , '' Heflin said . `` In planning for all Space Shuttle missions , it is necessary to formulate a work schedule that represents as realistic a timeline as possible to accomplish the mission objectives . '' Planning currently calls for at least five water tank training sessions that include support from the Mission Control Center , called joint integrated simulations , lasting between 10 and 36 hours . In addition , many stand alone underwater training `` runs '' will practice individual tasks in each spacewalk . Various refinements to the specific tasks on each spacewalk will be made based on actual training experience during the months prior to the mission . Also , lessons learned from other spacewalks leading up to the flight will be valuable in assisting the STS-61 crew in its training techniques . Endeavour 's June flight and Discovery 's July mission both will include spacewalks to evaluate some of the unique tools to be used on the HST mission . The evaluations will help in better understanding the differences between the actual weightlessness of space and the ground training in the water tanks at the Johnson Space Center , Houston , and the Marshall Space Flight Center , Huntsville , Ala. Also , the inflight spacewalking experiences will assist in gaining further insight into the time required for the various tasks and expand the experience levels among the astronaut corps , the flight controllers and trainers . Designed to be serviced by a Space Shuttle crew , Hubble was built with grapple fixtures and handholds to assist in the capture and repair procedures . The telescope was launched aboard Discovery in April 1990 . At that time the NASA mixed fleet manifest showed the first revisit mission to HST in 1993 to change out science instruments and make any repairs that may have become necessary . - end - ___ _____ ___ /_ /| /____/ \ /_ /| Ron Baalke | baalke @ kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov | | | | __ \ /| | | | Jet Propulsion Lab | ___| | | | |__ ) |/ | | |__ M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand /___| | | | ___/ | |/__ /| Pasadena , CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and |_____|/ |_|/ |_____|/ | part vegetable .

What I was asking is this : Please show me that the most effective substance-absure recovery programs involve meetinsg peoples ' spiritual needs , rather than merely attempting to fill peoples ' spiritual needs as percieved by the people , A.A , S.R.C . regulars , or snoopy . This will probably involve defining `` spritual needs '' ( is it not that clear ) and showing that such things exist and how they can be filled . Annother tack you might take is to say that `` fulfilling spiritual needs '' means `` acknowledging a `` higher power '' of some sort , then show that systems that do require this , work better than otherwise identical systems that do not . A correlation here would help you , but as you point out this might just be demonstrating swapping one crutch for annother . ( however , I do feel that religion is usually a better crutch than alchohol , as it is not usually poisonous ! : ) ) I hope with that clarification , my question will be answerable . I actually did know about the 12 step program , its the question of what it does , rather than what it tries to do , that makes a difference to me . -- - - Dan Johnson And God said `` Jeeze , this is dull '' ... and it *WAS* dull .

UCS.UMASS.EDU ( AFS ) who wrote : [ AFS ] Just a quick comment : : [ AFS ] [ AFS ] Armenians killed Turks -- -- -- Turks killed Armenians . [ AFS ] [ AFS ] Simple as that . Can anybody deny these facts ? Jews killed Germans in WWII -- Germans killed Jews in WWII , BUT there was quite a difference in these two statements , regardless of what Nazi revisionists say ! [ SY ] My grand parents were living partly in todays Armenia and partly in [ SY ] todays Georgia . There were villages , Kurd/Turk ( different Turkic groups ) [ SY ] Georgian ( muslim/christian ) Armenian and Farsi ... Very near to eachother . [ SY ] The people living there were aware of their differences . They were [ SY ] different people . For example , my grandfather would not have been happy [ SY ] if his doughter had willed to marry an Armenian guy . But that did not [ SY ] mean that they were willing to kill eachother . No ! They were neighbors . OK. [ SY ] Armenians killed Turks . Which Armenians ? Their neoghbors ? As far as my [ SY ] grandparents are concerned , the Armenians attacked first but these [ SY ] Armenians were not their neighbors . They came from other places . Maybe [ SY ] first they had a training at some place . They were taught to kill people , [ SY ] to hate Turks/Kurds ? It seems so ... There is certainly a difference between the planned extermination of the Armenians of eastern Turkey beginning in 1915 , with that of the Armeno- Georgian conflicts of late 1918 ! The argument is not whether Armenians ever killed in their collective existence , but rather the wholesale destruction of Anatolian Armenians under orders of the Turkish government . An Armenian- Georgian dispute over the disposition of Akhalkalak , Lori , and Pambak after the Turkish Third Army evacuated the region , can not be equated with the extermination of Anatolian Armenians . Many Armenians and Georgians died in this area in the scramble to re-occupy these lands and the lack of preparation for the winter months . This is not the same as the Turkish genocide of the Armenians nearly four years earlier , hundreds of kilometers away ! [ SY ] Anyway , but after they killed/raped/ ... Turks and other muslim people [ SY ] around , people assumed that 'Armenians killed us , raped our women ' , [ SY ] not a particular group of people trained in some camps , maybe backed [ SY ] by some powerful states ... After that step , you can not explain these [ SY ] people not to hate all Armenians . I do n't follow , perhaps the next paragraph will shed some light . [ SY ] So what am I trying to point out ? First , at least for that region , [ SY ] you can not blame Turks/Kurds etc since it was a self defense situation . [ SY ] Most of the Armenians , I think , are not to blame either . But since some [ SY ] people started that fire , it is not easy to undo it . There are facts . [ SY ] People can not trust eachother easily . It is very difficult to establish [ SY ] a good relation based on mutual respect and trust between nations with [ SY ] different ethnic/cultural/religious backgrounds but it is unfortunately [ SY ] very easy to start a fire ! Again , the fighting between Armenians and Georgians in 1918/19 had little to do with the destruction of the Armenians in Turkey . It is interesting that the Georgian leaders of the Transcaucasian Federation ( Armenia , Azerbaijan , and Georgia ) made special deals with Turkish generals not to pass through Tiflis on their way to Baku , in return for Georgians not helping the Armenians militarily . Of course , as Turkish troops marched across what was left of Caucasian Armenia , many Armenians went north and such population movement caused problems with the locals . This is in no comparison with events 4 years earlier in eastern Anatolia . My father 's mother 's family escaped Cemiskezek - > Erzinka - > Erzerum - > Nakhitchevan - > Tiflis - > Constantinople - > Massachusetts . [ SY ] My grandparents were *not* bloodthirsty people . We did not experience [ SY ] what they had to endure ... They had to leave their lands , there were [ SY ] ladies , old ladies , all of her children killed while she forced to [ SY ] witness ! Young women put dirt at their face to make themselves [ SY ] unattractive ! I do n't want to go into any graphic detail . My grandmother 's brother was forced to dress up as a Kurdish women , and paste potato skins on his face to look ugly . The Turks would kill any Armenian young man on sight in Dersim . Because their family was rather influential , local Kurds helped them escape before it was too late . This is why I am alive today . [ SY ] You may think that my sources are biased . They were biased in some sense . [ SY ] They experienced their own pain , of course . That is the way it is . But [ SY ] as I said they were living in peace with their neighbors before .

President Clinton 's Remarks On Waco With Q/A To : National Desk Contact : White House Office of the Press Secretary , 202-456-2100 WASHINGTON , April 20 /U.S . Newswire/ -- Following are remarks by President Clinton in a question and answer session with the press ( Part 2 of 2 ) : Go ahead , Sarah . Q There are two questions I want to ask you . The first is , I think that they knew very well that the children did not have gas masks while the adults did , so the children had no chance because this gas was very -- she said it was not lethal , but it was very dangerous to the children and they could not have survived without gas masks . And on February 28th -- let 's go back -- didn't those people have a right to practice their religion ? THE PRESIDENT : They were not just practicing their religion , they were -- the Treasury Department believed that they had violated federal laws , any number of them . Q What federal laws -- THE PRESIDENT : Let me go back and answer -- I can't answer the question about the gas masks , except to tell you that the whole purpose of using the tear gas was that it had been tested ; they were convinced that it would n't kill either a child or an adult but it would force anybody that breathed it to run outside . And one of the things that I 've heard -- I do n't want to get into the details of this because I do n't know -- but one of the things that they were speculating about today was that the wind was blowing so fast that the windows might have been opened and some of the gas might have escaped and that may be why it did n't have the desired effect . They also knew , Sarah , that there was an underground compound -- a bus buried underground where the children could be sent . And they were -- I think they were hoping very much that if the children were not released immediately outside that the humane thing would be done and that the children would be sent someplace where they could be protected . In terms of the gas masks themselves , I learned yesterday -- I did not ask this fact question before -- that the gas was supposed to stay active in the compound longer than the gas masks themselves were to work . So that it was thought that even if they all had gas masks , that eventually the gas would force them out in a nonviolent , nonshooting circumstance . MS. MYERS : Last question . Q Mr. President , why are you still saying that -- Q Could you tell us whether or not you ever asked Janet Reno about the possibility of a mass suicide ? And when you learned about the actual fire and explosion what went through your mind during those horrendous moments ? THE PRESIDENT : What I asked Janet Reno is if they had considered all the worse things that could happen . And she said -- and , of course , the whole issue of suicide had been raised in the public -- he had -- that had been debated anyway . And she said that the people who were most knowledgeable about these kinds of issues concluded that there was no greater risk of that now than there would be tomorrow or the next day or the day after that or at anytime in the future . That was the judgment they made . Whether they were right or wrong , of course , we will never know . What happened when I saw the fire , when I saw the building burning ? I was sick . I felt terrible . And my immediate concern was whether the children had gotten out and whether they were escaping or whether they were inside , trying to burn themselves up . That 's the first thing I wanted to know . Thank you . Q Mr. President , why are you still saying it was a Janet Reno decision ? Is n't it , in the end , your decision ? THE PRESIDENT : Well , what I 'm saying is that I didn't have a four- or five-hour , detailed briefing from the FBI . I didn't go over every strategic part of it . It is a decision for which I take responsibility . I 'm the President of the United States and I signed off on the general decision and giving her the authority to make the last call . When I talked to her on Sunday , some time had elapsed . She might have made a decision to change her mind . I said , if you decide to go forward with this tomorrow , I will support you . And I do support her . She is not ultimately responsible to the American people ; I am . But I think she has conducted her duties in an appropriate fashion and she has dealt with this situation I think as well as she could have . Thank you . ( Applause . ) -30-

From : denning @ guvax.acc.georgetown.edu Subject : REVISED TECHNICAL SUMMARY OF CLIPPER CHIP Distribution : world Organization : Georgetown University Lines : 167 Here is a revised version of my summary which corrects some errors and provides some additional information and explanation . THE CLIPPER CHIP : A TECHNICAL SUMMARY Dorothy Denning Revised , April 21 , 1993 INTRODUCTION On April 16 , the President announced a new initiative that will bring together the Federal Government and industry in a voluntary program to provide secure communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement . At the heart of the plan is a new tamper-proof encryption chip called the `` Clipper Chip '' together with a split-key approach to escrowing keys . Two escrow agencies are used , and the key parts from both are needed to reconstruct a key . CHIP CONTENTS The Clipper Chip contains a classified single-key 64-bit block encryption algorithm called `` Skipjack . '' The algorithm uses 80 bit keys ( compared with 56 for the DES ) and has 32 rounds of scrambling ( compared with 16 for the DES ) . It supports all 4 DES modes of operation . The algorithm takes 32 clock ticks , and in Electronic Codebook ( ECB ) mode runs at 12 Mbits per second . Each chip includes the following components : the Skipjack encryption algorithm F , an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips N , a 30-bit serial number ( this length is subject to change ) U , an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip The chips are programmed by Mykotronx , Inc. , which calls them the '' MYK-78 . '' The silicon is supplied by VLSI Technology Inc . They are implemented in 1 micron technology and will initially sell for about $ 30 each in quantities of 10,000 or more . The price should drop as the technology is shrunk to .8 micron . ENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP To see how the chip is used , imagine that it is embedded in the AT & T telephone security device ( as it will be ) . Suppose I call someone and we both have such a device . After pushing a button to start a secure conversation , my security device will negotiate an 80-bit session key K with the device at the other end . This key negotiation takes place without the Clipper Chip . In general , any method of key exchange can be used such as the Diffie-Hellman public-key distribution method . Once the session key K is established , the Clipper Chip is used to encrypt the conversation or message stream M ( digitized voice ) . The telephone security device feeds K and M into the chip to produce two values : E [ M ; K ] , the encrypted message stream , and E [ E [ K ; U ] + N ; F ] , a law enforcement field , which are transmitted over the telephone line . The law enforcement field thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U concatenated with the serial number N , all encrypted under the family key F. The law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after an authorized wiretap has been installed . The ciphertext E [ M ; K ] is decrypted by the receiver 's device using the session key : D [ E [ M ; K ] ; K ] = M . CHIP PROGRAMMING AND ESCROW All Clipper Chips are programmed inside a SCIF ( Secure Compartmented Information Facility ) , which is essentially a vault . The SCIF contains a laptop computer and equipment to program the chips . About 300 chips are programmed during a single session . The SCIF is located at Mykotronx . At the beginning of a session , a trusted agent from each of the two key escrow agencies enters the vault . Agent 1 enters a secret , random 80-bit value S1 into the laptop and agent 2 enters a secret , random 80-bit value S2 . These random values serve as seeds to generate unit keys for a sequence of serial numbers . Thus , the unit keys are a function of 160 secret , random bits , where each agent knows only 80 . To generate the unit key for a serial number N , the 30-bit value N is first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1 . S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1 , producing a 64-bit block R1 : R1 = E [ D [ E [ N1 ; S1 ] ; S2 ] ; S1 ] . Similarly , N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and N3 , and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed : R2 = E [ D [ E [ N2 ; S1 ] ; S2 ] ; S1 ] R3 = E [ D [ E [ N3 ; S1 ] ; S2 ] ; S1 ] . R1 , R2 , and R3 are then concatenated together , giving 192 bits . The first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2 . The rest are discarded . The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2 . U1 and U2 are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow agencies . As a sequence of values for U1 , U2 , and U are generated , they are written onto three separate floppy disks . The first disk contains a file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part U1 . The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values . The third disk contains the unit keys U . Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent 2 takes the second disk . Thus each agent walks away knowing an 80-bit seed and the 80-bit key parts . However , the agent does not know the other 80 bits used to generate the keys or the other 80-bit key parts . The third disk is used to program the chips . After the chips are programmed , all information is discarded from the vault and the agents leave . The laptop may be destroyed for additional assurance that no information is left behind . The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the room instead of two . The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2 , and the second two ( the escrow agents ) would take the disks back to the escrow agencies . The escrow agencies have as yet to be determined , but they will not be the NSA , CIA , FBI , or any other law enforcement agency . One or both may be independent from the government . LAW ENFORCEMENT USE When law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line , they will first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get access to the communications line . Let us assume that the tap is in place and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with the Clipper Chip . The law enforcement field is first decrypted with the family key F , giving E [ K ; U ] + N. Documentation certifying that a tap has been authorized for the party associated with serial number N is then sent ( e.g. , via secure FAX ) to each of the key escrow agents , who return ( e.g. , also via secure FAX ) U1 and U2 . U1 and U2 are XORed together to produce the unit key U , and E [ K ; U ] is decrypted to get the session key K. Finally the message stream is decrypted . All this will be accomplished through a special black box decoder . CAPSTONE : THE NEXT GENERATION A successor to the Clipper Chip , called `` Capstone '' by the government and `` MYK-80 '' by Mykotronx , has already been developed . It will include the Skipjack algorithm , the Digital Signature Standard ( DSS ) , the Secure Hash Algorithm ( SHA ) , a method of key exchange , a fast exponentiator , and a randomizer . A prototoype will be available for testing on April 22 , and the chips are expected to be ready for delivery in June or July . ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND DISTRIBUTION NOTICE .

Here is where I think we are talking at cross-purposes . It is not clear to me that the kind of definition I have proposed should be taken as describing what `` science is mainly about . '' Consider , for example , a definition of invertebrates as all animals lacking a backbone . This fairly tells what is an invertebrate and what is not an invertebrate , but it hardly tells you what invertebrates are all about . One can read this definition and still not know that 95 % of all animal species are invertebrates , that invertebrates possess a remarkably broad range of form , that some invertebrate groups -- such as insects and nematodes -- are ubiquitous in all ecosystems , etc . In short , knowing the definition of invertebrates does *not* tell one what they are '' mainly about . '' The misunderstanding here is my fault .

I agree on both counts . As an example of the second , it would only take a few cases of curing rabies to convince most veterinarians that a treatment was effective , despite a lack of controls . As to the first , I do not think it is useful to talk about '' absolute scientific truth . '' I think it is more useful to talk about the kinds of evidence that various claims have and the kinds of evidence IN PARTICULAR FIELDS that in the past have proven faulty or reliable . The latter is obviously a matter of degree , and in each field , practitioners try to discover the relevance of different kinds of evidence . One of the primary mistakes that marks the advocacy of an idea as psuedo-science is that the advocacy lacks any sense of proportion regarding the kinds of evidence related to the proposed claim , the kinds of evidence that are actually relevant to it , and the historical reasons in the field that certain kinds of evidence are given more weight than others . It is perfectly alright to speculate . I have read quite a few refereed papers that speculated left and right . But the authors were careful to identify the notions as speculative , to list what little evidence was presently available for them , and to describe how research could proceed to either put the notion on more firm footing or to uncover its problems . Often what distinguishes whether a paper of this sort passes muster is the thoughtfulness with which the author sets the context and paves the way for future work . ( It is in this area that many proponents of speculative ideas fail . ) > The folks over in sci.psychology have a hundred and one excuses not to > make this simple test .

When proponents of some practice see no value in more careful investigation of that practice , that sets alarms ringing in many researchers ' minds . This is unfortunate , because there is undoubtedly some intersection between things that are worth investigating and things that are advocated by those who seem careless or unreasonable in their advocacy . On the other hand , I can understand why many scientists would just as soon select other directions for research . As Gordon Banks has pointed out , no one wants to become this generation 's Rhine . > One academic in sci.psychology said that it would be completely > unscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it has n't > been described in a scientific journal . ... I think this is absurd . > Actually , at least one fairly careful academic study has been done > ( with favorable results ) , but it 's apparently not acceptable because > it 's a doctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal . I wonder why the results were not published . In my field , dissertation results are typically summarized in papers that are submitted to journals . Often the papers are accepted for publication before the dissertation is finished . ( This certainly eases one 's defense . ) Finally , I hope Lee Lady will forgive me from commenting either on NLP or the discussion of it in sci.psychology . I know little about either and so have nothing to offer . Russell

Whether a scientific idea comes while one is staring out the window , or dreaming , or having a fantasy , or watching an apple fall ( Newton ) , or sitting in a bath ( Archimedes ) ... it is ultimately the result of a lot of intense scientific thinking done beforehand . Letting one 's mind roam freely and giving rein to one 's intuition can be a useful way of coming up with new ideas , but only when one has done a lot of rational analysis of the problem first . Scientific intuition is not something one is born with . It is something that one learns . Maybe we do n't understand completely how it is learned , but training in systematic scientific thinking is certainly one of the key elements in developing it . Informal exploration is also often an important element in finding new scientific ideas . One thinks , for instance , of Darwin 's naturalistic studies in the Galapagos islands , which led him to the ideas for the theory of evolution . This is why I am offended by a definition of science that emphasizes empirical verification and does not recognize thinking and informal exploration as important scientific work . I agree that mere speculation does not deserve to be called science . I also think that mere empirical studies not directed by good scientific thinking are at best a very poor kind of science .

Now , try dealing with the rest of what I wrote . What is more , the activities of the Armenian Government seem to have been efforts aimed at eradicating a race ( the Turks ) or aimed at carrying out a one-sided feud , instead of being a struggle for liberation . From the outset , the efforts of the Armenian revolutionaries within the Ottoman borders took the form of terrorist and destructive actions aimed at mass murder , cruelty and genocide , so that no other interpretation of them is possible . Armenian activities started during the reign of Abdulhamid II as individual acts of terror , and then developed into assassinations and surprise attacks . The element of brute force in these activities increased steadily , culminating in mass rebellions and widespread fighting during the First World War . Furthermore , when the Ottoman army withdrew from Eastern Anatolia after the 1915 Sarikamis defeat , Armenian revolutionaries initiated a series of cruelties in this area . Although the Russians occupied Eastern Anatolia as an enemy , nevertheless they were constrained by the rules of war . However , when they returned to their country in 1917 after the Revolution , Armenian revolutionaries were unchecked in this area for about a year until the Ottoman forces returned to Erzurum in 1918 . During this period , Armenian revolutionaries executed massacres on the local people which is recorded in historical documents . [ 1 ] For example , let us look at a report dated 21 March 1918 which the Commander of the Third Army submitted when he entered Erzurum and Erzincan : `` They were completely and systematically destroyed and burned down by Armenians , even the trees were cut down , and they are like a building entirely consumed by fire in every sense of the word . '' As for the people who had been living in Erzurum and Erzincan : '' Those who were capable of fighting were taken away at the very beginning with the excuse of forced labor in road construction , they were taken in the direction of Sarikamis and annihilated . When the Russian army withdrew , a part of the remaining people was destroyed in Armenian massacres and cruelties : they were thrown into wells , they were locked in houses and burned down , they were killed with bayonets and swords , in places selected as butchering spots , their bellies were torn open , their lungs were pulled out , and girls and women were hanged by their hair after being subjected to every conceivable abominable act . A very small part of the people who were spared these abominations far worse than the cruelty of the inquisition resembled living dead and were suffering from temporary insanity because of the dire poverty they had lived in and because of the frightful experiences they had been subjected to . Including women and children , such persons discovered so far do not exceed one thousand five hundred in Erzincan and thirty thousand in Erzurum . All the fields in Erzincan and Erzurum are untilled , everything that the people had has been taken away from them , and we found them in a destitute situation . At the present time , the people are subsisting on some food they obtained , impelled by starvation , from Russian storages left behind after their occupation of this area . `` [ 2 ] Foreign observers who witnessed the events , including Russian Officers who did not desert their lines , submitted detailed reports proving the genocide to Ottoman commanders who received them as prisoners of war . What is most important is that they stated in their reports 'the massacres did not happen by chance but were planned . ' [ 3 ] At the end of the war , the German author Dr. Weiss , his Austrian colleague Dr. Stein and his Turkish colleague Mr. Ahmet Vefik visited Trabzon , Kars , Erzurum and Batum between April 17th and May 20th 1918 to record the cruelties . Their writings not only show the scope of Armenian activities , but also reveal their goal and true nature .

No . No . NOOO ! ! ! The ground ( green ) wire is for safety . No current is supposed to flow in it under normal conditions . This means that there 's normally no voltage drop in it either . It is supposed to be safe to touch the ground wire ... even if you 're grounded in some other way at the same time . The neutral ( white ) wire is , as Dave Vanderbyl correctly said , the return for the hot wire . Since current flows in it , there 's a voltage drop . If you plug a heavy load into a properly-wired grounded outlet , you can commonly measure a volt or so of difference between neutral and ground . They are supposed to be connected together at the breaker panel ... but nowhere , repeat NOwhere , else . ( Well , almost . There are strange exceptions for things like sub-panels . ) What you CAN do if you want three-prong outlets without additional wiring is to use a GFCI outlet ( or breaker , but the outlet will be cheaper ) . In fact , depending on where you are putting your new outlet ( s ) , a GFCI may be *required* . There is a FAQ on electrical wiring , posted regularly to rec.woodworking and news.answers .

Traders , BTW , is located in San Leandro , CA . Granted , the document may be asking you and I to help out Traders , but in the big scope of things , I feel that we would do all gun owners a favor by helping to this cause . Anyway , here it is : NEWSPAPER AD CENSORSHIP Are you letting the newspapers tell you how to live your life , what 's good for you , what 's not , and exercise blatant censorship over what you read in their advertisments ? The newspapers have now decided to censor gun ads - which is why you no longer see the ads that Traders , San Leandro , has run for many years . These ads were run for the law-abiding honest citizens who own firearms for sporting use or self-protection . They certainly have the right to do so , under the Second Amendment Right to Bear Arms . If you are tired of newspapers who run sex and liquor ads galor , yet refuse to run legitimate gun ads , please send a letter to the editors indicating your displeasure over their censorship doctrine . Following is a list of Bay area newspapers who censor gun ads . Perhaps you'd like to send them your thoughts on this issue !

I can not validate these facts , and there were no sources , but many feel and sound very true . Here are the topic headlines : - Big Media Snow Job - Blaming Firearms for Murder is Like Blaming Hospitals for Death - I could use the same Nazi Journalistic Technique of CBS and ABC to prove that Hospitals Cause Death - How NBC , CBS , and ABC have scammed the American people on `` gun control '' - American TV journalism is based on Nazi journalism - Why TV journalists lie - The Government with the help of the TV networks , has succeeded in playing one group against the other - Gun laws are unconstitutional - American gun laws are based on Nazi gun laws - The Government is trying to devide and conquer - The CIA wants your firearms and so on for six pages . So now we have the media trying help put gun dealers out of business by trying to limit their exposure to potential customers , and preventing the customers from reading about sales of ammunition and firearms for sporting , hunting , or other recreational use .

God being unknowable , I ca n't comment on His motives , but it would be distressing if He allowed us to misunderstand Him through no fault of our own . For sanity 's sake we must assume , if we believe in Him at all , that His message comes through somehow . The question is whether it comes through immediately to every individual , or is contained in a complex canon that must be interpreted by experts in consultation with one another , or is transmitted directly through appointed representatives who are free to interpret , extend and modify the canon . If God 's message is indeed mediated , the further problem arises as to whether the individual under- stands the mediated message fully and clearly . Since the responsibility for understanding lies ultimately with the individual , we must assume that God in His benevolence guides each individual to the appropriate source for that individual , whereof the person may or may not drink . > > Metaphysically , if there are multiple moral codes then there is no > > Absolute moral code , and I think this is theologically questionable . > No .

Incidentally , the young child considers the directive > as absolute until he gets older ( see Piaget ) and learns a morality of his own . Your example is complicated in our age by the thin line between morality and politeness . You might have said `` burp '' , for burping and swearing carry about the same stigma today . If you are talking about `` taking the Lord 's name in vain '' as a serious transgression , then this example is more a case of hypocrisy than of varying moral codes . If there is an absolute moral code , propositions or laws in that code apply absolutely and universally , by definition . Conceivably some moral codes could be subsets of the universal code , as you say at the outset . So , for example , God 's code could include , `` Thou shalt not create Beings without a hospitable planet to live on '' , but this law would be inapplicable to us . Nevertheless , we would be entitled to suppose that all laws applicable to us are also applicable to God . But when you begin to ask what laws might appear in God 's moral code , you have a sense of the absurdity of the question . Does God make laws for Himself to follow ? Perhaps God is not the sort of being to which the category `` morality '' can be sensibly applied . -- James Owens ad354 @ Freenet.carleton.ca Ottawa , Ontario , Canada

Some > send data to both , some only send data to the left channel > ( the first is preferrable , of course ) Okay , I guess its time for a quick explanation of Mac sound . The original documentation for the sound hardware ( IM-3 ) documents how to make sound by directly accessing hardware . Basically , you jam values into all the even bytes from SoundBase to SoundBase+0x170 . This was because of how the Mac 128 ( and some later machines ) generated sound was by scanning this block and D/Aing every even byte ( the odd bytes went to the floppy on some machines ) . When the Mac II ( and Apple Sound Chip ) was invented , it was designed to generate stereo sound . It was also designed to be compatible with we had once documented . So storing bytes at the even values at SoundBase meant `` I want to play a mono sound '' and so it was emulated . But Apple had since retracted the documentation on SoundBase and decided not to document the lowest layers of sound generation . So apple never explained where to stuff bytes if you want to make stereo sound . Enter game developers . The sound driver and current sound manager are inconveniently lame for making games . Furthermore , people who port from the IBM do n't want to learn more APIs . So , it has become popular for game writers to write to SoundBase to make sound , since it is very easy . Since the Mac II , Apple has had many different kind of sound output hardware , and the only things they have in common are that writing to SoundBase works . On some hardware , ( Mac II , IIx , IIcx , IIci at least ) , writing to SoundBase gets you mono sound through both speakers . On some Macs ( Quadra 700/900/950 at least ) writing to SoundBase gets you mono sound on the left channel only . Both are technically correct interpretations of the original specification , but one is obviously preferable for asthetic reasons . If developers use the Sound Manager ( and I think the sound driver ) , mono sounds will ( typically ) come out through both channels regardless of the underlying hardware . It is possible to specify you want to generate left channel only , but no one does . If developers write to sound base , their games will only come out the left on some games . The other problem , the original Mac II only producing left channel sound on the internal speaker , while the SE/30 mixes both , is n't really related . It is due to the post generation amplification used on the motherboards of the different machines . It only affects true stereo sounds . Sounds which are actually mono , will play on the internal speaker , no matter what machine you have . Now , to more directly address the question , the games you list : > Lemmings > Out of This World ( awesome game , BTW ) > Glider 4.0 > OIDS and also Hellcats , Super Tetris Oxyd ( and many more , these are just what I 've tested ) Cheat and write to SoundBase and so are only left channel on Quadras . Other games you list : > Armor Alley > Spectre > Spaceward Ho ! and also PGA Tour Golf Civilization ( and more , these are again only from personal experience ) Use the sound manager and work fine on all machines . The more of the story is to developers : DO N'T CHEAT ! Really , I am absolutely , positively not allowed to do what I am about to do , but I 'm going say it anyway . Stop cheating on sound ! Really soon , you will be sorry , as even those without external speakers will be disappointed with your sound on future hardware . The grace period is about to end . The Sound Manager is understandable now , and works pretty well and will work even better soon , so use it . In conclusion : To Doug , it is n't a hardware problem , at least , not a bug . To Jon , it is n't a choice to developers as to whether they want to send sound to both channels . If they do it the right way , it is taken care of automatically . If you cheat , there is not way to make it work on all hardware . Have fun . Disclaimer number 1 : I do n't work on sound here at Apple , I 'm just pretty well informed . So do n't write me with sound questions . Disclaimer number 2 : If it says up above that I wrote anything like `` the grace period is about to end '' then it is a bug in your news feed , since I am catagorically not allowed to say anything like that . You know what I mean . Disclaimer number 3 : I do n't speak for Apple , just me . -Steve Bollinger

Jewish religion was the foundation for Christianity and Islam . In other words Judaism has fathered both religions . Now Islam has turned against its father I may say . It is Ironic that after communizem threat is almost gone , religion wars are going to be on the raise . I thought the idea of believing on one God , was to Unite all man kind . How come both Jews and Islam which believe on the same God , `` the God of Ebrahim '' are killing each other ? Is this like Dr. Frankenstien 's story ? How are you going to stop this from happening ? How are you going to deal with so many Muslims . Nuking them would distroy the whole world ? Would God get mad , since you have killed his followers , you believe on the same God , same heaven and the same hell after all ? What is the peacefull way of ending this Saga ? Man kind needs religion , since it sets up the rules and the regulations which keeps the society in a healthy state . A religion is mostly a sets of rules which people have experienced and know it works for the society . The praying , keeps the sole healthy and meditates it . God does not care for man kinds pray , but man kind hopes that God will help him when he prays . Religion works mostly on the moral issues and trys to put away the materialistic things in the life . But the religious leaders need to make a living through religion ? So they may corrupt it , or turn it to their own way to make their living . i.e Muslims have to pay % 20 percent of their income to the Mullahs . I guess the rabie gets his cut too ! Is in it that religion should be such that everybody on planet earth respects each other , be good toward each other helps one another , respect the mother nature . Is in that heaven and hell are created on earth through the acts that we take today ? Is in it that within every man there is good and bad , he could choose either one , then he will see the outcome of his choice . How can we prevent man kind from going crazy over religion . How can we stop another religious killing field , under poor Gods name ? What are your thoughts ? Do you think man kind would to come its senses , before it is too late ? P.S . on the side Do you think that Moses saw the God on mount Sina ? Why would God go to top of the mountain ? He created the earth , he could have been anywhere ? why on top the mountain ? Was it because people thought to see God you have to reach to the skies/heavens ? Why God kept coming back to Middle East ? Was it because they created God through their imagination ? Is that why Jewish people were told by God , they were the chosen ones ? Profit Mohammad was married to Khadijeh . She was a Jewish . She taught him how to trade . She probably taught him about Judaism . Quran is mostly copy right of Taurah ( sp ? old testement ) . Do you think God wrote Quran ? Makeh was a trade city before Islam . Do you think it was made to be the center of Islamic world because Mohammad wanted to expand his trade business ? Is that why God has put his house in there ? I think this religious stuff has gone too far . All man kind are going to hurt from it if they do not wise up . Look at David Koresh , how that turned out ? I am afraid in the bigger scale , the Jews and the Muslims will have the same ending ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Religion is needed in the sense to keep people in harmony and keep them doing good things , rather than plotting each others distruction . There is one earth , One life and one God . Let 's all man kind be good toward each other . God help us all . Peace

Covey '' < covey+ @ andrew.cmu.edu > Subject : Gun Stats & Mortal Risks Date : Mon , 15 Feb 1993 18:35:05 -0500 ( EST ) Folks , Hail from the nether world . On February 4th , the Wall Street Journal carried a front-page article by Erik Larson entitled `` Armed Force . '' I felt a reply was in order to his citation of the notorious scare stat that `` A Gun is 43 times more likely to kill than to protect . '' I sent the following to the WSJ . -- -- - Gun Stats & Mortal Risks Preston K. Covey Erik Larson~s even-handed article on Paxton Quigley ( ~Armed Force , ~ 2/4/93 , WSJ ) cites the world~s most notorious ~statistic~ regarding guns in the home : ~A pioneering study of residential gunshot deaths in King County , Washington , found that a gun in the home was 43 times more likely to be used to kill its owner , spouse , a friend or child than to kill an intruder.~ The ~43 times~ stat is everywhere these days ; it has grown in media lore like the proverbial urban myth : it was inflated by one pugilistic talk-show pundit to ~93.~ Given the shock value of the finding , the conclusion of the 1986 New England Journal of Medicine ( NEJM ) study is remarkably understated : ~The advisability of keeping firearms in the home for protection must be questioned.~ Responsible people should indeed question the risks and benefits of bringing a firearm into their home . But what we need to know is this : What exactly are the risks and benefits ? The NEJM testimony is neither the whole truth about the benefits nor nothing but the truth about the risks . Further , as with motor vehicles , we want to know : What control do we have over the risks and benefits ? And , as with the risks of cancer or heart disease or auto accidents : How can we minimize the risks ? Like raw highway death tolls , the NEJM stat is not very helpful here . The NEJM finding purports to inform us , but it is framed to warn us off . It is widely promulgated in the media as a ~scare stat , ~ a misleading half-truth whose very formulation is calculated to prejudice and terrify . The frightful statistic screams for itself : The risks far outweigh the benefits , yes ? What fool would run these risks ? If your car were 43 times more likely to kill you , a loved one , a dear friend or an innocent child than to get you to your destination , should you not take the bus ? Uncritical citation puts the good name of statistics in the bad company of lies and damned lies . Surely , we can do better where lives are at stake . Let~s take a closer look at this risky business : The ~43 times~ stat of the NEJM study is the product of dividing the number of home intruders/aggressors justifiably killed in self-defense ( the divisor ) into the number of family members or acquaintances killed by a gun in the home ( the dividend ) . The divisor of this risk equation is 9 : in the study~s five-year sample there were 2 intruders and 7 other cases of self-defense . The dividend is 387 : in the study there were 12 accidental deaths , 42 criminal homicides , and 333 suicides . 387 divided by 9 yields 43 . There were a total of 743 gun-related deaths in King County between 1978 and 1983 , so the study leaves 347 deaths outside of homes unaccounted . The NEJM~s notorious ~43 times~ statistic is seriously misleading on six counts : 1 . The dividend is misleadingly characterized in the media : the ~or acquaintances~ of the study ( who include your friendly drug dealers and neighborhood gang members ) is equated to ~friends.~ The implication is that the offending guns target and kill only beloved family members , dear friends , and innocent children . Deaths may all be equally tragic , but the character and circumstance of both victims and killers are relevant to the risk . These crucial risk factors are masked by the calculated impression that the death toll is generated by witless Waltons shooting dear friends and friendly neighbors . This is criminological hogwash . 2 . The study itself does not distinguish households or environs populated by people with violent , criminal , or substance-abuse histories -- where the risk of death is very high -- versus households inhabited by more civil folk ( for example , people who avoid high-risk activities like drug dealing , gang banging and wife beating ) -- where the risk is very low indeed . In actuality , negligent adults allow fatal but avoidable accidents ; and homicides are perpetrated mostly by people with histories of violence or abuse , people who are identifiably and certifiably at ~high risk~ for misadventure . To ignore these obvious risk factors in firearm accidents and homicides is as misleading as ignoring the role of alcohol in vehicular deaths : by tautology , neither gun deaths nor vehicular deaths would occur without firearms or vehicles ; but the person and circumstance of the gun owner or driver crucially affect the risk . 3 . One misleading implication of the way the NEJM stat is framed is that the mere presence of a gun in the home is much more likely to kill than to protect , and this obscures -- indeed , disregards -- the role of personal responsibility . The typical quotation of this study ( unlike Larson~s ) attributes fatal agency to the gun : ~A gun in the home is 43 times as likely to kill . . . .~ ( The Center to Prevent Handgun Violence , a major promulgator of the NEJM statistic , uses this particular formulation . ) We can dispense with the silly debate about whether it~s people or guns that accomplish the killing : again , by tautology , gun deaths would not occur without the guns . The question begged is how many deaths would occur anyway , without the guns . In any case , people are the death-dealing agents , the guns are their lethal instruments . The moral core of the personal risk factors in gun deaths are personal responsibility and choice . Due care and responsibility obviate gun accidents ; human choice mediates homicide and suicide ( by gun or otherwise ) . The choice to own a gun need not condemn a person to NEJM~s high-risk pool . The gun does not create this risk by itself . People have a lot to say about what risk they run with guns in their homes . For example , graduates of Paxton Quigley~s personal protection course do not run the touted ~43 times~ risk any more than skilled and sober drivers run the same risks of causing or suffering vehicular death as do reckless or drunk drivers . Undiscriminating actuarials disregard and obscure the role of personal responsibility and choice , just as they disregard and obscure the role of socio-economic , criminological and other risk-relevant factors in firearm-related death . This is why we resent insurance premiums and actuarial consigment to risk pools whose norms disregard our individualities . Fortunately , nothing can consign us to the NEJM risk pool but our own lack of choice or responsibility in the matter . 4 . Suicide accounts for 84 % of the deaths by gun in the home in the NEJM study . As against the total deaths by gun in King County , including those outside the home , in-house suicides are 44 % of the total death toll , which is closer to the roughly 50 % proportion found by other studies . Suicide is a social problem of a very different order from homicide or accidents . The implication of the NEJM study is that these suicides might not occur without readily available guns . It is true that attempted suicide by gun is likely to succeed . It is not obviously true that the absence of a gun would prevent any or all of these suicides . This is widely assumed or alleged , but the preponderance of research on guns and suicide actually shows otherwise , that this is wishful thinking in all but a few truly impulsive cases . ( See : Bruce L. Danto et al. , The Human Side of Homicide , Columbia University Press , 1982 ; Charles Rich et al. , ~Guns and Suicide , ~ American Journal of Psychiatry , March 1990 . ) If suicides were removed from the dividend of the NEJM study~s risk equation , the ~43 times~ stat would deflate to ~six.~ The inclusion of suicides in the NEJM risk equation -- like the causes , durability , or interdiction of suicidal intent itself -- is a profoundly debatable matter . Quotations of the NEJM study totally disregard this issue . 5 . Citations of the NEJM study also mislead regarding the estimable rate of justifiable and excusable homicide . Most measures , like the NEJM homicide rate , are based on the immediate disposition of cases . But many homicides initially ruled criminal are appealed and later ruled self-defense . In the literature on battered women , immediate case dispositions are notorious for under-representing the rate of justifiable or excusable homicide . Time~s January 18 , 1993 , cover story on women ~Fighting Back~ reported one study~s finding that 40 % of women who appeal have their murder convictions thrown out . Time~s July 17 , 1989 , cover story on a week of gun deaths reported 51 % of the domestic cases as shootings by abuse victims ; but only 3 % of the homicides were reported as self-defense . In a May 14 , 1990 , update , Time reported that 12 % of the homicides had eventually been ruled self-defense . In Time~s sample , the originally reported rate of self-defense was in error by a factor of four . The possibility of such error is not acknowledged by promulgators of the NEJM statistic . 6 . While both the dividend and the product of the NEJM risk equation are arguably inflated , the divisor is unconscionably misleading . The divisor of this equation counts only aggressors who are killed , not aggressors who are successfully thwarted without being killed or even shot at . The utility of armed self-defense is the other side of the coin from the harms done with guns in homes . What kind of moral idiocy is it to measure this utility only in terms of killings ? Do we measure the utility of our police solely in terms of felons killed -- as opposed to the many many more who are otherwise foiled , apprehended , or deterred ? Should we not celebrate ( let alone count ) those cases where no human life is lost as successful armed defenses ? The question posed to media that cite the NEJM scare stat is this : Why neglect the compendious research on successful armed defense , notably by criminologist Gary Kleck ( Point Blank : Guns and Violence in America , Aldine de Gruyter , 1992 ) ? Kleck~s estimations of the rate and risk of defensive firearm use are based on victimization surveys as well as other studies : the rate is high ( about one million a year ) and the risk is good ( gun defenders fare better than anyone , either those who resort to other forms of resistance or those who do not resist ) . Dividing one million gun defenses a year by 30,000 annual gun deaths ( from self-defense , homicides , suicides , and accidents ) yields 33 . Thus , we can construct a much more favorable statistic than the NEJM scare stat : A gun is 33 times more likely to be used to defend against assault or other crime than to kill anybody . Of course , Kleck~s critics belittle the dividend of this calculation ; what is good news for gun defenders is bad news for gun control . We should indeed question the basis and method of Kleck~s high estimation of defensive firearm use , as I have questioned the NEJM statistic . Clearly , the issue of how to manage mortal risks is not settled by uncritical citation of statistics . One thing troubles me still : we can hardly escape the unquestioned NEJM scare stat in our media , but we hardly ever find Kleck~s good work mentioned , even critically . -- Larry Cipriani -- l.v.cipriani @ att.com

In our case , other monitors cause this problem - the deflection coil of other monitors to be specific . Have also seen a monitor backed up to a fuse panel exhibit this problem . This sounds like your problem since flourescent lites , motors , etc several 10s of feet away seem to me to be too far to cause it , but the juice running to them must pass nearby your monitor . Fusebox on other side of wall maybe ? We started spec'ing Panasonic CT-1331Y video monitors ( 3 switchable input lines ( vid & aud ) S-VHS on one ) < $ 400 . This stopped the wavy interference effect on the computer monitor next to it . Now on to your problem . You need what is known as mu shielding ( very common , in fact almost mandatory on electrostatic deflection type O'scopes ) . I talked to a EE prof . He said get a coffee can , cut both ends off , mount around deflection coil of interfering monitor . BE CAREFUL TO AVOID ALL HIGH VOLTAGE CIRCUITRY . ESPECIALLY THE THICKER HIGH VOLTAGE ANODE LEAD USUALLY COLORED RED . IF YOU KILL YOURSELF , DON'T BLAME/SUE ME ! ! ! USE PLASTIC OR OTHER NON-CONDUCTING STAND-OFFS AND SUCH TO MOUNT CAN . Now , I would assume that what is good for keeping mag fields in is also good at keeping them out , so hopefully this 'll work by mounting shield on monitor being interfered with as well . If not , start shielding those other sources . Jeff Babb babb @ sciences.sdsu.edu babb @ ucssun1.sdsu.edu Programmer , SDSU - LARC

The parts are mostly independent , but you should read the first part before the rest . We do n't have the time to send out missing parts by mail , so do n't ask . Notes such as `` [ KAH67 ] '' refer to the reference list in the last part . The sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu as /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part [ xx ] . The Cryptography FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt , sci.answers , and news.answers every 21 days . Contents * How do I recover from lost passwords in WordPerfect ? * How do I break a Vigenere ( repeated-key ) cipher ? * How do I send encrypted mail under UNIX ? [ PGP , RIPEM , PEM , ... ] * Is the UNIX crypt command secure ? * How do I use compression with encryption ? * Is there an unbreakable cipher ? * What does `` random '' mean in cryptography ? * What is the unicity point ( a.k.a . unicity distance ) ? * What is key management and why is it important ? * Can I use pseudo-random or chaotic numbers as a key stream ? * What is the correct frequency list for English letters ? * What is the Enigma ? * How do I shuffle cards ? * Can I foil S/W pirates by encrypting my CD-ROM ? * Can you do automatic cryptanalysis of simple ciphers ? * What is the coding system used by VCR+ ? * How do I recover from lost passwords in WordPerfect ? WordPerfect encryption has been shown to be very easy to break . The method uses XOR with two repeating key streams : a typed password and a byte-wide counter initialized to 1+ < the password length > . Full descriptions are given in Bennett [ BEN87 ] and Bergen and Caelli [ BER91 ] . Chris Galas writes : `` Someone awhile back was looking for a way to decrypt WordPerfect document files and I think I have a solution . There is a software company named : Accessdata ( 87 East 600 South , Orem , UT 84058 ) , 1-800-658-5199 that has a software package that will decrypt any WordPerfect , Lotus 1-2-3 , Quatro-Pro , MS Excel and Paradox files . The cost of the package is $ 185 . Steep prices , but if you think your pw key is less than 10 characters , ( or 10 char ) give them a call and ask for the free demo disk . The demo disk will decrypt files that have a 10 char or less pw key . '' * How do I break a Vigenere ( repeated-key ) cipher ? A repeated-key cipher , where the ciphertext is something like the plaintext xor KEYKEYKEYKEY ( and so on ) , is called a Vigenere cipher . If the key is not too long and the plaintext is in English , do the following : 1 . Discover the length of the key by counting coincidences . ( See Gaines [ GAI44 ] , Sinkov [ SIN66 ] . ) Trying each displacement of the ciphertext against itself , count those bytes which are equal . If the two ciphertext portions have used the same key , something over 6 % of the bytes will be equal . If they have used different key , then less than 0.4 % will be equal ( assuming random 8-bit bytes of key covering normal ASCII text ) . The smallest displacement which indicates an equal key is the length of the repeated key . 2 . Shift the text by that length and XOR it with itself . This removes the key and leaves you with text XORed with itself . Since English has about 1 bit of real information per byte , 2 streams of text XORed together has 2 bits of info per 8-bit byte , providing plenty of redundancy for choosing a unique decryption . ( And in fact one stream of text XORed with itself has just 1 bit per byte . ) If the key is short , it might be even easier to treat this as a standard polyalphabetic substitution . All the old cryptanalysis texts show how to break those . It 's possible with those methods , in the hands of an expert , if there 's only ten times as much text as key . See , for example , Gaines [ GAI44 ] , Sinkov [ SIN66 ] . * How do I send encrypted mail under UNIX ? [ PGP , RIPEM , PEM , ... ] Here 's one popular method , using the des command : cat file | compress | des private_key | uuencode | mail Meanwhile , there is a de jure Internet standard in the works called PEM ( Privacy Enhanced Mail ) . It is described in RFCs 1421 through 1424 . To join the PEM mailing list , contact pem-dev-request @ tis.com . There is a beta version of PEM being tested at the time of this writing . There are also two programs available in the public domain for encrypting mail : PGP and RIPEM . Both are available by FTP . Each has its own newsgroup : alt.security.pgp and alt.security.ripem . Each has its own FAQ as well . PGP is most commonly used outside the USA since it uses the RSA algorithm without a license and RSA 's patent is valid only ( or at least primarily ) in the USA . RIPEM is most commonly used inside the USA since it uses the RSAREF which is freely available within the USA but not available for shipment outside the USA . Since both programs use a secret key algorithm for encrypting the body of the message ( PGP used IDEA ; RIPEM uses DES ) and RSA for encrypting the message key , they should be able to interoperate freely . Although there have been repeated calls for each to understand the other 's formats and algorithm choices , no interoperation is available at this time ( as far as we know ) . * Is the UNIX crypt command secure ? No . See [ REE84 ] . There is a program available called cbw ( crypt breaker 's workbench ) which can be used to do ciphertext-only attacks on files encrypted with crypt . One source for CBW is [ FTPCB ] . * How do I use compression with encryption ? A number of people have proposed doing perfect compression followed by some simple encryption method ( e.g. , XOR with a repeated key ) . Unfortunately , you can only compress perfectly if you know the exact distribution of possible inputs . For all practical purposes it's impossible to describe `` the typical English text '' beyond coarse characteristics such as single-letter frequencies . You can build up more and more sophisticated models of your inputs , but if the enemy has a slightly more accurate model , he 'll be able to find some redundancy in your compressed output . Note that nearly all practical compression schemes , unless they have been designed with cryptography in mind , produce output that actually starts off with high redundancy . For example , the output of UNIX compress begins with a well-known three-byte `` magic number '' that can serve as an entering wedge for cryptanalysis . This is not to say that compression before encryption is inherently a bad idea ; it just has to be done very , very carefully , and by no means removes the need for strong encryption . Compression after encryption is silly . * Is there an unbreakable cipher ? Yes . The one-time pad is unbreakable ; see part 4 . Unfortunately the one-time pad requires secure distribution of as much key material as plaintext . Of course , a cryptosystem need not be utterly unbreakable to be useful . Rather , it needs to be strong enough to resist attacks by likely enemies for whatever length of time the data it protects is expected to remain valid . * What does `` random '' mean in cryptography ? Cryptographic applications demand much more out of a pseudorandom number generator than most applications . For a source of bits to be cryptographically random , it must be computationally impossible to predict what the Nth random bit will be given complete knowledge of the algorithm or hardware generating the stream and the sequence of 0th through N-1st bits , for all N up to the lifetime of the source . A software generator ( also known as pseudo-random ) has the function of expanding a truly random seed to a longer string of apparently random bits . This seed must be large enough not to be guessed by the opponent . Ideally , it should also be truly random ( perhaps generated by a hardware random number source ) . Those who have Sparcstation 1 workstations could , for example , generate random numbers using the audio input device as a source of entropy , by not connecting anything to it . For example , cat /dev/audio | compress - > foo gives a file of high entropy ( not random but with much randomness in it ) . One can then encrypt that file using part of itself as a key , for example , to convert that seed entropy into a pseudo-random string . When looking for hardware devices to provide this entropy , it is important really to measure the entropy rather than just assume that because it looks complicated to a human , it must be `` random '' . For example , disk operation completion times sound like they might be unpredictable ( to many people ) but a spinning disk is much like a clock and its output completion times are relatively low in entropy . * What is the unicity point ( a.k.a . unicity distance ) ? See [ SHA49 ] . The unicity distance is an approximation to that amount of ciphertext such that the sum of the real information ( entropy ) in the corresponding source text and encryption key equals the number of ciphertext bits used . Ciphertexts significantly longer than this can be shown probably to have a unique decipherment . This is used to back up a claim of the validity of a ciphertext-only cryptanalysis . Ciphertexts significantly shorter than this are likely to have multiple , equally valid decryptions and therefore to gain security from the opponent 's difficulty choosing the correct one . Unicity distance , like all statistical or information-theoretic measures , does not make deterministic predictions but rather gives probabilistic results : namely , the minimum amount of ciphertext for which it is likely that there is only a single intelligible plaintext corresponding to the ciphertext , when all possible keys are tried for the decryption . Working cryptologists do n't normally deal with unicity distance as such . Instead they directly determine the likelihood of events of interest . Let the unicity distance of a cipher be D characters . If fewer than D ciphertext characters have been intercepted , then there is not enough information to distinguish the real key from a set of possible keys . DES has a unicity distance of 17.5 characters , which is less than 3 ciphertext blocks ( each block corresponds to 8 ASCII characters ) . This may seem alarmingly low at first , but the unicity distance gives no indication of the computational work required to find the key after approximately D characters have been intercepted . In fact , actual cryptanalysis seldom proceeds along the lines used in discussing unicity distance . ( Like other measures such as key size , unicity distance is something that guarantees insecurity if it 's too small , but does n't guarantee security if it 's high . ) Few practical cryptosystems are absolutely impervious to analysis ; all manner of characteristics might serve as entering `` wedges '' to crack some cipher messages . However , similar information-theoretic considerations are occasionally useful , for example , to determine a recommended key change interval for a particular cryptosystem . Cryptanalysts also employ a variety of statistical and information-theoretic tests to help guide the analysis in the most promising directions . Unfortunately , most literature on the application of information statistics to cryptanalysis remains classified , even the seminal 1940 work of Alan Turing ( see [ KOZ84 ] ) . For some insight into the possibilities , see [ KUL68 ] and [ GOO83 ] . * What is key management and why is it important ? One of the fundamental axioms of cryptography is that the enemy is in full possession of the details of the general cryptographic system , and lacks only the specific key data employed in the encryption . ( Of course , one would assume that the CIA does not make a habit of telling Mossad about its cryptosystems , but Mossad probably finds out anyway . ) Repeated use of a finite amount of key provides redundancy that can eventually facilitate cryptanalytic progress . Thus , especially in modern communication systems where vast amounts of information are transferred , both parties must have not only a sound cryptosystem but also enough key material to cover the traffic . Key management refers to the distribution , authentication , and handling of keys . A publicly accessible example of modern key management technology is the STU III secure telephone unit , which for classified use employs individual coded `` Crypto Ignition Keys '' and a central Key Management Center operated by NSA . There is a hierarchy in that certain CIKs are used by authorized cryptographic control personnel to validate the issuance of individual traffic keys and to perform installation/maintenance functions , such as the reporting of lost CIKs . This should give an inkling of the extent of the key management problem . For public-key systems , there are several related issues , many having to do with `` whom do you trust ? '' * Can I use pseudo-random or chaotic numbers as a key stream ? Chaotic equations and fractals produce an apparent randomness from relatively compact generators . Perhaps the simplest example is a linear congruential sequence , one of the most popular types of random number generators , where there is no obvious dependence between seeds and outputs . Unfortunately the graph of any such sequence will , in a high enough dimension , show up as a regular lattice . Mathematically this lattice corresponds to structure which is notoriously easy for cryptanalysts to exploit . More complicated generators have more complicated structure , which is why they make interesting pictures -- - but a cryptographically strong sequence will have no computable structure at all . See [ KNU81 ] , exercise 3.5-7 ; [ REE77 ] ; and [ BOY89 ] . * What is the correct frequency list for English letters ? There are three answers to this question , each slightly deeper than the one before . You can find the first answer in various books : namely , a frequency list computed directly from a certain sample of English text . Of course any such list will be `` correctly '' computed , but exactly which list you get depends on which sample was taken . The second answer is that the question does n't make sense . What do you mean by `` English letters '' ? The `` English language '' is not a fixed , finite , closed object that can be exactly characterized . It has changed over time ; it is different between different authors . Any particular message will have different statistics from those of the language as a whole . The third answer is that yes , no particular message is going to have exactly the same characteristics as English in general , but for all reasonable statistical uses these slight discrepancies wo n't matter . In fact there 's an entire field called `` Bayesian statistics '' ( other buzzwords are `` maximum entropy methods '' and `` maximum likelihood estimation '' ) which studies questions like `` What 's the chance that a text with these letter frequencies is in English ? '' and comes up with reasonably robust answers . So make your own list from your own samples of English text . It will be good enough for practical work , if you use it properly . * What is the Enigma ? `` For a project in data security we are looking for sources of information about the German Enigma code and how it was broken by the British during WWII . '' See [ WEL82 ] , [ DEA85 ] , [ KOZ84 ] , [ HOD83 ] , [ KAH91 ] . * How do I shuffle cards ? Card shuffling is a special case of the permutation of an array of values , using a random or pseudo-random function . All possible output permutations of this process should be equally likely . To do this , you need a random function ( modran ( x ) ) which will produce a uniformly distributed random integer in the interval [ 0..x-1 ] . Given that function , you can shuffle with the following [ C ] code : ( assuming ARRLTH is the length of array arr [ ] and swap ( ) interchanges values at the two addresses given ) for ( n = ARRLTH-1 ; n > 0 ; n -- ) swap ( & arr [ modran ( n+1 ) ] , & arr [ n ] ) ; modran ( x ) can not be achieved exactly with a simple ( ranno ( ) % x ) since ranno ( ) 's interval may not be divisible by x , although in most cases the error will be very small . To cover this case , one can take ranno ( ) 's modulus mod x , call that number y , and if ranno ( ) returns a value less than y , go back and get another ranno ( ) value . * Can I foil S/W pirates by encrypting my CD-ROM ? Someone will frequently express the desire to publish a CD-ROM with possibly multiple pieces of software , perhaps with each encrypted separately , and will want to use different keys for each user ( perhaps even good for only a limited period of time ) in order to avoid piracy . As far as we know , this is impossible , since there is nothing in standard PC or workstation hardware which uniquely identifies the user at the keyboard . If there were such an identification , then the CD-ROM could be encrypted with a key based in part on the one sold to the user and in part on the unique identifier . However , in this case the CD-ROM is one of a kind and that defeats the intended purpose . If the CD-ROM is to be encrypted once and then mass produced , there must be a key ( or set of keys ) for that encryption produced at some stage in the process . That key is useable with any copy of the CD-ROM 's data . The pirate needs only to isolate that key and sell it along with the illegal copy . * Can you do automatic cryptanalysis of simple ciphers ? schneier @ chinet.chi.il.us ( Bruce Schneier ) says : AccessData of Orem , Utah sells products that break the password scheme of a number of popular Macintosh and PC software packages .

From : rogntorb @ idt.unit.no ( Torbj|rn Rognes ) Subject : Adding int . hard disk drive to IIcx Keywords : Mac IIcx , internal , hard disk drive , SCSI Reply-To : rogntorb @ idt.unit.no ( Torbj|rn Rognes ) Organization : Div . of CS & Telematics , Norwegian Institute of Technology Lines : 32 I have n't seen much info about how to add an extra internal disk to a mac . We would like to try it , and I wonder if someone had some good advice . We have a Mac IIcx with the original internal Quantum 40MB hard disk , and an unusable floppy drive . We also have a new spare Connor 40MB disk which we would like to use . The idea is to replace the broken floppy drive with the new hard disk , but there seems to be some problems : The internal SCSI cable and power cable inside the cx has only connectors for one single hard disk drive . If I made a ribbon cable and a power cable with three connectors each ( 1 for motherboard , 1 for each of the 2 disks ) , would it work ? Is the IIcx able to supply the extra power to the extra disk ? What about terminators ? I suppose that i should remove the resistor packs from the disk that is closest to the motherboard , but leave them installed in the other disk . The SCSI ID jumpers should also be changed so that the new disk gets ID # 1 . The old one should have ID # 0 . It is no problem for us to remove the floppy drive , as we have an external floppy that we can use if it wo n't boot of the hard disk .

This is true for the mass market , but not for those who need strong crypto and are willing to pay the price . After all , one can buy strong crypto today if one is willing to spend enough . Thus the concern is not economic . The issue most worth worrying about is that after the system takes hold , the government will outlaw other systems , and something voluntary will become the only system available . That is a political , not an economic issue . As a separate matter , you may be making an implied advocacy for cheap secure crypto for everyone . It 's true that the Clipper chip would probably prevent that except via Clipper , but `` cheap , secure crypto for everyone '' is a political discussion , not an economic one , and the whole point of Clipper is to resolve that political ( policy ) tension between securing legitimate communications and tapping the crooks . -- David Sternlight Great care has been taken to ensure the accuracy of our information , errors and omissions excepted .
From : rich.bellacera @ amail.amdahl.com Subject : `` Ex-Gay '' ? ( was : HOMOSEXUALITY Fact & Fiction ) Lines : 152 Return-Path : < amail.amdahl.com ! rich.bellacera @ juts.ccc.amdahl.com > Tony- While I honestly believe you believe you are doing a `` good thing '' by posting that piece of propaganda , I believe the more people believe that the more they will feel justified in their blatant persecution of gay oriented people . I have seen the film called `` The Gay Agenda '' and along with my church we found it to be horrifying . Not because of what was actually shown ( cleaver use of editting can create any image one wants to portray ) , rather becaseu we are familia familiar with how widely it was actively distributed and how many naive people are actually believing the garbage found within it . The truth is that neither you nor I can fully speak for anyone who calls themself gay , but knowing as many as I do and knowing their testimonies and witnessing thier faith and life I have to say that the report you posted is a very biased report , something obviously claimed against gays as well . The truth is that unless YOU are innately gay you can not know what harm you are causing . I speak as an abolitionist who supports affirming gay rights in our society . I do not support wild sex or any other misrepresentations perpetrated by Christian Fundamentalist extremists , but I know people who are not the sexual deviants your report paints them to be . It is no mistake that the APA removed homosexuality from it 's list of mental illnesses , it is also no mistake that there are many Christians and homophobes who long to bring it back to the list . I do not feel threatened by gays , I do n't understand why others are . The following is an article concerning two of the more popular ex-gay min- istries : Exodus International & Homosexuals Anonymous . THE FOUNDER OF AN `` EX-GAY '' SUPPORT GROUP CHOOSES HOMO OVER HETERO by Robert Pela ( from Gay oriented magazine ADVOCATE ) In December 1985 , David Caligiuri received one of The Advocate 's homophobia rewaa awards : the A Prayer A Day Keeps the Lust Away citation . As director of FREE INDEED , a national ex-gay ministry , Caligiuri was singled out for offering discontented gays and lesbians `` a way out of the homosexual death-style '' through prayer . `` I 'd like to give the award back , '' Caligiuri now laughs , `` I'm no longer deserve it . '' Caligiuri 's eight year involvement with the national `` ex-gay '' movement peaked with his founding of the Phoenix chapter of Homosexuals Anonymous ( HA ) as well as Free Indeed . He has since abandoned his pulpit and now says that the ex- gay movement is a fruitless effort based on deception . `` There 's no reality in it , '' he says , `` I was selling a product , and my product was a lie . '' Headed up by national ministries like Exodus International and Courage , the organizations of the ex-gay movement rely on the tenents of born-again Christianity to convince disatisfied homosexuals -- usually young gay men who are just coming out -- that they can shed their sexuality by suppressing their sexual urges and embracing Christianity . `` We offer support to people who are seeking to leave the sin of homosexuality , '' explains Bob Davies , director of Exodus . He ventures that `` about 80 % of those seeking to abandon their homo- sexuality are men . '' `` Anybody who is involved in the ex-gay ministry is misguided and is wasting their time , '' says Lisa Seeley , a former `` redeemed lesbian '' who worked with Caligiuri as HA and appeared with him on the Sally Jessy Raphael show . `` These organizations are for people who are spiritually and emotionally wounded . '' `` It 's possible to change your identity or your behavior , '' says sex educator Brian McNaught , author of _On Being Gay_ . `` But it 's really impossible to change your orientation . These people are no longer calling themselves gay , but they continue to have same-sex erotic feelings . '' Caligiuri says he founded Free Indeed after an ominous week in 1981 when all hell broke loose in his personal life . A few days after his lover ended both their romance and their business partnership , Caligiuri was sexually assaulted by a man he picked up in a bar . `` I was really drunk , '' he recalls , `` and I went home with this guy . He tied me up and raped me . He left me tied up all night , and the next morning he raped me again . '' When Caligiuri was eventually freed by the attacker , he returned home to the home he shared with his ex-lover . `` He had another man there with him , '' Caligiuri recalls . `` I thought at this time , 'If this is what being gay is about , I do n't want to be this way anymore . '' Caligiuri vowed that if he could find a way out , he would share his discovery with others . He organized an antigay contingent to demonstrate at Phoenix's gay pride parade in June 1985 , and a few months later Free Indeed held its first public protest . At a meeting to promote a gay civil rights ordinance , Free Indeed members loudly blasted gays , telling them ther were sinners headed for hell . Free Indeed began receiving about a hundred telephone calls a week , thanks in part to a deceptive listing in the local yellow pages . `` We were listed under Lesbian and Gay Alternative Services , '' Caligiuri says , `` so people thought we were a gay information switchboard . People would call to find out where the local bars were , and we 'd preach to them about the sins of homo- sexuality . '' Ruses like this are typical of the movement , Caligiuri says , adding , `` They 'll do anything to reach these people . '' `` David used to go on radio and say really stupid things , '' recalls Peter Kelly , a counselor at Phoenix 's Catholic diocese AIDS program , `` like that he knew he was gay when he started wearing pastel colors . '' Caligiuri 's family first found out about his ministry when they saw him on Raphael 's syndicated talk show in 1985 . `` They were relieved , '' he recalls . `` They figured that if they had to have a gay person in the family , better that I should be a 'reformed ' gay person . '' But Caligiuri was hardly reformed . `` By the time I appeared on Sally's show , '' `` I 'd started having sex with men again . Men would call our hotline and tell me about thier latest sin : sex with their pastor , sex with their father . I was horny all the time . '' Unable to risk going to gay bars , where he might be recognized from his numerous television appearances , Caligiuri says he `` used to go to bookstores and get blowjobs . '' When he was n't working the bookstores , he was sleeping with other `` reformed '' homosexuals . `` I did n't realize it at first , but a lot of the HA leaders were having sex with one another , '' Caligiuri says . `` We 'd go to conferences in other cities , and we 'd be paired up in hotel rooms . Everybody was sleeping with everybody else . '' By the time he appeared on 'AM Philadelphia ' television show in May 1988 , Caligiuri was having anonymous sex a couple times a week . When the show's host asked him if he ever `` acted on temptation , '' his answer was a lie . Caligiuri 's duplicity began to take it 's toll on him , however . He was suffering from chrinic fatigue syndrome and candidiasis , a dibilitating yeast infection , and this led to his escape from the sect . `` I was too sick to go to church , '' he explains . `` The more time I spent away from those people the more I began to feel like myself . I began to remember who I used to be . '' Late in 1991 , Caligiuri turned Free Indeed phone lines over to a local church and closed the ministry 's doors . `` I 'd convinced myself that there is no need in the world for ex-gay people , '' he says . Today , Caligiuri , 31 , is studying alternative spiritualities ( `` I 'm interest- ed in belief systems that are n't judgemental . `` ) , considering romance ( `` But not with a CHristian ! `` ) , and searching for a new project to devote himself to . `` I feel compelled to commit myself to gay causes , '' he says . `` I want to eventually stop feeling guilty about what I did and make up for the damage I may have brought to our community . '' -- -end article -- - Caligiuri 's tory is by no means unique and I have read several other articles of former leaders and founders of 'ex-gay ' ministries who have said very similar th similar things . Fortuantely not all of them have left Christianity , but have come to realize that God loves them despite the attitudes of others . Some , like Chris Glaser , director of the Presbyterian `` Lazarus Project '' of West Hollywood Presbyterian Church have actually been working with the gay community to bring them into the sheepfold of Christ and encouraging real ethical values of sexuality within the sphere of being gay . I have also , as I said talked and become and become close friends with many who once attended such groups as `` Love In Action '' and others , who either once claimed to have been `` reformed '' or who were too honest with themselves to live a lie , no matter who was disappointed in them . Some were even encouraged to marry as a way of `` sealing '' their new heterosexuality , only to eventually start hitting the bars , bathhouses and bookstores , since these were usually activities under the concealment of night and one-night-stands of promiscuous behavior meant no continuous `` sin '' through a committed relationship . This is a horrible trap which the CHurch has dumped on the backs of the truly gay oriented people , and the very inno- cent victims in these cases are the wives and children of such marriages . Yet the church insists that there are only two options they are willing to allow gay people : 1 ) heterosexuality or 2 ) celebacy . This is sad . What is also mrtifying , is in the cases of those who can not suppress their desires and fear for thier sanity in such a mixed up confusion that the church forces on them , they may even opt for 'suicide ' or surgical dampering of the brain functions . In the past lobotomies and heavey drug suppressants were common- place . There are now becoming available more and more literature on the threat of coercive Christianity toward gays , such as Sylvia Pennington's _ '' Ex-Gays ? There Are None_ . and others . There are also a great many fact based books being written to help people trapped in this confusion such as Maury Johnston 's _Gays Under Grace_ , and Chris Glaser 's _Come Hom ! _ . I seriously recommend those for people seeking help for this persecution and self-acceptance . Thank you .

If your tastes tend to smaller , more petite ( cough ) churchgoers , it is more likely that they will have a smaller head , and you can safely get a medium or small helmet .

The satellite was in three sections separated by two booms . The central section housed the DISCOS Disturbance Compensation System , which consisted of a proof mass of special non-magnetic alloy housed within a spherical cavity . The proof mass flew a true gravitational orbit , free from drag and radiation pressure . Teflon microthrusters kept the body of the satellite centered around the proof mass , thereby flying the entire satellite drag free . TRIAD was one of the APL-designed Navy Navigation Satellites . The 2nd-generation operational navigation satellites flying today ( NOVA ) use a single-axis version of DISCOS . TRIAD was also the sixth APL satellite to be powered by an RTG ( APL flew the first nuclear power supply in space , in 1961 ) .

Students and professionals in the engineering and scientific communitites are encouraged to apply for classes commencing in June 1993 and January 1994 . PROGRAM OBJECTIVES The program intends to promote technology transfer between Japan and the United States . It is also designed to let scientists , engineers , and managers experience how the Japanese proceed with technological development . This is facilitated by extended internships in Japanese research facilities and laboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to develop long-term professional relationships with their Japanese counterparts . PROGRAM DESIGN To fulfill the objectives of the program , participants will be required to develop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan and its culture . Correspondingly , JSTMP consists of three major components : 1 . TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE Several Japanese language courses will be offered , including intensive courses designed to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in a relatively short time . 2 . EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTURE A particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of the cultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches in manufacturing and information technology . Courses will be available in a variety of departments throughout both universities including Anthropology , Sociology , History , and Political Science . Moreover , seminars and colloquiums will be conducted . Further , a field trip to Japanese manufacturing or research facilities in the United States will be scheduled . 3 . AN INTERNSHIP OR A STUDY MISSION IN JAPAN Upon completion of their language and cultural training at PITT and CMU , participants will have the opportunity to go to Japan and observe , and participate in the management of technology .

Let us not forget the Nazi Armenians . Nazi Armenians were of service to Germans in Arab countries as well . As Uzun put it , one well-known case which received a lot of media-coverage involved two Nazi Armenian agents which were dropped over Syria by Italian war planes . The mission of the agents was to mingle among the Armenian population in Syria and to acquire relevant information for the German Wehrmacht on the allied forces in the area . [ 1 ] Nazi Armenians also helped German propaganda efforts in Arab countries designed to promote pro-Nazi sentiments among the French- and British-ruled Arab populations . Beirut had traditionally been strong-hold of the Nazi Armenians and until very recently it was the center of international Armenian terrorism . In Russia General Dro ( the Butcher ) , the architect of the Turkish genocide in WWI , was working closely with the German Secret Service . He entered the war zone with his own men and acquired important intelligence about the Soviets . His experience with the Turkish genocide in x-Soviet Armenia made him an invaluable source for the Germans . [ 2 ] [ 1 ] Meyer , Berkian , ibid. , p. 150 .

( was Re : New Testament Double Stan Organization : Nyx , Public Access Unix at U. of Denver Math/CS dept . Lines : 98 seanna @ bnr.ca ( Seanna ( S.M . ) Watson ) asks : > What is the objection to celebration of Easter ? The objection naturally is in the way in which you phrase it . Easter ( or Eashtar or Ishtar or Ishtarti or other spellings ) is the pagan whore goddess of fertility . Therefore , your question to me is `` what is the objection to celebration of the pagan whore goddess ? '' When phrased that way I suspect ( or at least I would HOPE ) that it becomes immeadiately apparent what my objection to `` celebrating '' her would be . > It is celebration of the resurrection of Jesus . No , you are thinking perhaps of `` Ressurection Sunday '' I think . ( Though I 'm not too crazy about the word `` Sunday '' , but I certainly like this phrasing much better than envoking the name of the whore goddess . ) For that matter , stay Biblical and call it Omar Rasheet ( The Feast of First Fruits ) . Torah commands that this be observed on the day following the Sabbath of Passover week . ( Sunday by any other name in modern parlance . ) Why is there so much objection to observing the Resurrection on the 1st day of the week on which it actually occured ? Why jump it all over the calendar the way Easter does ? Why not just go with the Sunday following Passover the way the Bible has it ? Why seek after unbiblical methods ? > I do n't recall a command in Scripture for us to celebrate > the resurrection , but it is the sole and only reason that > we are Christians -- how could we not celebrate it ? So what does this question have to do with Easter ( the whore goddess ) ? I am all for celebrating the Resurrection . Just keep that whore out of the discussion . > If it is only the name which is a problem , I suggest that if > we are too concerned about etymology , there are a lot of > words we are going to have to drop .

And while we are at it , the left-handed people are both `` sinister '' and `` gauche '' so we probably will have some objections from that quarter as well . > In Quebec French , the word for the celebration of the > resurrection is `` Pa^ques '' -- this is etymologically related > to Pesach ( Passover ) and the pascal lamb .

What happened to `` there is > neither Jew nor Greek , slave nor free , male nor female , for > all are one in Christ Jesus '' ? Read the letter to Philemon . Now tell me , was Philemon 's `` slave '' returned to him ? Were there different rules upon the slave than upon Philemon ? How about male and female ? Are there different `` rules '' that apply to them as well ? Or if there is no more `` male and female '' can Adam and Steve get married to each other in your congregation ? Yes , there are differences in form and function .

I 'd like to suggest that people think very carefully about this argument . Words often change their meaning over time . The days of the week are of course originally based on pagan gods . Some Christians prefer to refer to `` first day '' , `` second day '' , etc . However the majority of Christians have not been persuaded . The question seems to be whether it makes any difference what the dictionary shows as the derivation of a word , if what people mean by it and think when they use it is different . Indeed I 'd like to suggest that postings like this could themselves be dangerous . Suppose people in general use Easter to mean the celebration of Christ 's resurrection . Postings trying to convince them that they really mean a celebration in honor of some godess run the risk of creating exactly the situation that they claim to oppose . They are doing their best to *create* a linkage in people 's minds between their celebration and the pagan goddess . It 's not clear that this is a healthy thing . -- clh ]

Better yet , instead of thrashing around on the DOS file system , take it a step further . Write yourself a minimal `` file system '' program that is used to create/delete files , en/decrypt them to ramdisk , list a directory . Put the util , password protected , on a floppy . The catch is that the storage space used by this util is NOT part of the DOS file system . Instead , defrag your disk , thus packing all allocated clusters into clusters 0-n. Then use the back end of the partition to hold your 'stealth ' file system . Or , leave a small 2nd partition on the disk that is not assigned to DOS . Another approach might be to use a directory that contains a set of invariant files ( DOS system files , for instance ) . Due to DOS allocating a minimum storage unit of a `` cluster '' there is unused physical space on the disk between the tail end of each file and the end of its associated cluster .

Having lived , played , and worked on and near the Navajo reservation for a number of years , I can confirm this is an ancient pattern , found in petroglyphs dated 800 to 1200 years old . Also , the Indians never stopped making rugs with this pattern - they just stopped selling them after the Nazi 's pre-empted the swastika . Note also that the Indian versions use both clockwise and counter-clockwise swastikas . Ob guns : It 's the rare Navaho family that does n't own a rifle . They remember being `` relocated '' by the US Army , and do n't intend to do it again . The Hopi , on the other hand , have a dislike for weapons , from my experience . Perhaps they just hide them better from strangers . -- Kirk Hays - NRA Life , seventh generation . `` The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing .
