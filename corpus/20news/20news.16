Basically , limited tort means that you give up your right to sue for pain and suffering , unless one of the following conditions is met : 1 . Your medical bills resulting from the accident exceed $ X ( where X is some number like 50,000 -- I 'm not sure of the exact number ) 2 . The accident was caused by a drunk driver ( I mean , the OTHER driver was drunk ) 3 . You get a good lawyer and have a good case ( basically , you can appeal to regain your right to sue , but there 's almost no chance of this ever happening ) . You are only giving up your right to sue for pain and suffering ; you can still sue for medical costs , actual damages , etc . By agreeing to limited tort , you are essentially giving up your right to be an asshole who treats every accident as an entry into the litigation lottery . In exchange , you get a substantial reduction in your rates . I save $ 150/year . Unfortunately , the insurance companies have managed to scare and confuse people so much that only about 5 % of Pennsylvanians go for limited tort . I guess that 's OK -- If more people opted for it , the insurance companies would be pushing harder for repeal .
From : neal @ cmptrc.lonestar.org ( Neal Howard ) Subject : Re : Dogs vs. Bikes Organization : CompuTrac Inc. , Richardson TX Lines : 28 My first encounter with a dog chasing after my bike was on my first poker run . A big german shepard ran out into the pack of bikes I was riding with and tried to bite the right leg of the guy riding in front of me . He kicked the dog a couple of times ( we were all only going about 10-15mph ) and just made the dog angrier and got away by applying WFO and outrunning the dog who then started after yours truly . At the time , I had open drag pipes ( obnoxiously loud as hell ) and as soon as the dog was about 2 feet away from the right side of my bike , I pulled in the clutch and revved the motor up to about 5000rpm and the roar of the pipes frightened the dog away ( probably made the dog 's ears hurt like hell ) and he did n't come back for the rest of the bikers behind me either . My second encounter was with an already deceased road-kill dog . I was n't paying very close attention to the pavement when the car in front of me straddled the carcass . I looked down just in time to see what I was about to run over so I just held onto the handlebars and freaked out . Both wheels went squarely over the dog 's belly with a thump-thump just like running over a piece of a 4x4 lumber . The bike did n't lose any stability at all and I kept on going . After I got to my destination , I found bits of fur , meat , and blood stuck to the bottom of my motor and frame ... ... gross . -- ============================================================================= Neal Howard '91 XLH-1200 DoD # 686 CompuTrac , Inc ( Richardson , TX ) doh # 0000001200 |355o33| neal @ cmptrc.lonestar.org Std disclaimer : My opinions are mine , not CompuTrac 's . `` Let us learn to dream , gentlemen , and then perhaps we shall learn the truth .

Such a hostage situation has taken place on numerous occasions with the result of the police trying to take the place by force and the result being the death of the hostages and the gunmen . However , this is the first time I 've heard of the blame landing squarely on the police . In this country we have a policy of not negotiating a back down from terrorists and hostage takers since that only encourages other terrorists and hostage takers . Richard

THE SOVIETS AND VENUS PART 3 Copyright ( c ) 1993 by Larry Klaes The author gives permission to any group or individual wishing to distribute this article , so long as proper credit is given , the author is notified , and the article is reproduced in its entirety . To the North Pole ! On June 2 and 7 , 1983 , two of the Soviet Union 's mighty PROTON rockets lifted off from the Tyuratam Space Center in the Kazakhstan Republic . Aboard those boosters were a new breed of VENERA probe for the planet Venus . Designated VENERA 15 and 16 , the probes were meant not for landing yet more spherical craft on the Venerean surface but to radar map the planet in detail from orbit . To accomplish this task , the basic VENERA design was modified in numerous areas . The central bus core was made one meter ( 39.37 inches ) longer to carry the two tons of propellant required for braking into orbit , double the fuel carried by the VENERA 9 and 10 orbiters eight years earlier . Extra solar panels were added on to give the vehicles more power for handling the large amounts of data which would be created by the radar imaging . The dish-shaped communications antennae were also made one meter larger to properly transmit this information to Earth . Atop the buses , where landers were usually placed , were installed the 1.4 by 6-meter ( 4.62 by 19.8-foot ) , 300-kilogram ( 660-pound ) POLYUS V side-looking radar antennae . The radar system , possibly a terrain-imaging version of the nuclear-powered satellites used by the Soviets for Earth ocean surveillance , would be able to map Venus' surface at a resolution of one to two kilometers ( 0.62 to 1.2 miles ) . The Soviet probes ' imaging parameters were a vast improvement over the United States PIONEER VENUS Orbiter , which could reveal objects no smaller than 75 kilometers ( 45 miles ) in diameter . And while the VENERAs ' resolution was comparable to that of similar observations made by the 300-meter ( 1,000-foot ) Arecibo radio telescope on the island of Puerto Rico , the orbiters would be examining the northern pole of Venus . This region was unobtainable by either Arecibo or PIONEER VENUS and appeared to contain a number of potentially interesting geological features worthy of investigation . On October 10 , 1983 , after an interplanetary journey of 330 million kilometers ( 198 million miles ) and two mid-course corrections , VENERA 15 fired its braking rockets over Venus to place itself in a polar orbit 1,000 by 65,000 kilometers ( 600 by 39,000 miles ) around the planet , completing one revolution every twenty-four hours . VENERA 16 followed suit four days later . The twin probes thus became Venus ' first polar-circling spacecraft . Radar operations began on October 16 for VENERA 15 and October 20 for VENERA 16 . For up to sixteen minutes every orbit over the north pole , the probes would make a radar sweep of the surface 150 kilometers ( ninety miles ) wide and nine thousand kilometers ( 5,400 miles ) long . The craft would then head out to the highest part of their orbits over the south pole to recharge their batteries and transmit the data back to two large Soviet antennae on Earth . Each strip of information took eight hours to process by computer . By the end of their main missions in July of 1984 , the VENERAs had mapped 115 million square kilometers ( 46 million square miles ) , thirty percent of the entire planet . VENERA 15 and 16 revealed that Venus has a surface geology more complex than shown by PIONEER VENUS in the late 1970s . Numerous hills , mountains , ridges , valleys , and plains spread across the landscape , many of them apparently formed by lava from erupting volcanoes in the last one billion years . In planetary terms this makes the Venerean surface rather young . Hundreds of craters were detected as well , the largest of which had to have been created by meteorites ( planetoids would be a better term here ) at least fourteen kilometers ( 8.4 miles ) across , due to Venus ' very dense atmosphere . There were some disagreements between U.S. and Soviet scientists on the origins of certain surface features . For example , the probes ' owners declared that the 96-kilometer ( 57.6-mile ) wide crater at the summit of 10,800-meter ( 35,640-foot ) high Maxwell Montes , the tallest mountain on the planet , was the result of a meteorite impact . American scientists , on the other hand , felt the crater was proof that Maxwell was a huge volcano sitting on the northern `` continent '' of Ishtar Terra . In any event , the U.S. decided to wait on making verdicts about Venus until the arrival of their own radar probe , scheduled for later in the decade . Originally named the Venus Orbiting Imaging Radar ( VOIR ) , its initial design was scaled back and the craft was redesig- nated the Venus Radar Mapper ( VRM ) . Eventually the machine would be called MAGELLAN , after the Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan ( circa 1480-1521 ) . This vehicle would map the entire planet in even finer detail than the VENERAs . For the time , however , the Soviet probes maintained that distinction . Radar imaging was not the only ability of the VENERAs . Bolted next to the POLYUS V radar antenna were the Omega altimeter and the Fourier infrared spectrometer , the latter for measuring the world's temperatures . The majority of the areas covered registered about five hundred degrees Celsius ( 932 degrees Fahrenheit ) , but a few locations were two hundred degrees hotter , possibly indicating current volcanic activity . The probes also found that the clouds over the poles were five to eight kilometers ( three to 4.8 miles ) lower than at the equator . In contrast , the polar air above sixty kilometers ( thirty-six miles ) altitude was five to twenty degrees warmer than the equatorial atmosphere at similar heights . When the main mapping mission ended in July of 1984 , there were plans for at least one of the VENERAs to radar image the surface at more southernly latitudes . Unfortunately this idea did not come to pass , as the orbiters may not have possessed enough attitude-control gas to perform the operation . VENERA 15 and 16 ceased transmission in March of 1985 , leaving the Soviet Institute of Radiotechnology and Electronics with six hundred kilometers ( 360 miles ) of radar data tape to sort into an atlas of twenty-seven maps of the northern hemisphere of Venus . Venus by Balloon For years the thick atmosphere of Venus had been a tempting target to scientists who wished to explore the planet 's mantle of air with balloon-borne instruments . Professor Jacques Blamont of the French space agency Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales ( CNES ) had proposed such an idea as far back as 1967 , only to have a joint French-Soviet balloon mission canceled in 1982 . Nevertheless , late in the year 1984 , such dreams would eventually come true . When two PROTON rockets were sent skyward on December 15 and 21 , the Soviet Union provided Western observers with the first clear , full views of the booster which had been launching every Soviet Venus probe since 1975 . This was but one of many firsts for the complex mission . The unmanned probes launched into space that December were named VEGA 1 and 2 , a contraction of the words VENERA and GALLEI - Gallei being the Russian word for Halley . Not only did the spacecraft have more than one mission to perform , they also had more than one celestial objective to explore , namely the comet Halley . This famous periodic traveler was making its latest return to the inner regions of the solar system since its last visit in 1910 . Since it was widely believed that comets are the icy remains from the formation of the solar system five billion years ago , scientists around the world gave high priority to exploring one of the few such bodies which actually come close to Earth . Most comets linger in the cold and dark outer fringes of the solar system . Some , like Halley , are perturbed by various forces and fall in towards the Sun , where they circle for millennia spewing out ice and debris for millions of kilometers from the warmth of each solar encounter . The Soviet Union , along with the European Space Agency ( ESA ) and Japan 's Institute of Space and Astronautical Science ( ISAS ) , did not wish to miss out on this first opportunity in human history to make a close examination of Halley . The ESA would be using the cylindrical GIOTTO probe to make a dangerously close photographic flyby of the comet , while Japan 's first deep space craft - SAKIGAKE ( Pioneer ) and SUISEI ( Comet ) - would view Halley from a much safer distance . Scientists in the United States also desired to study the comet from the vantage of a space probe , at one time envisioning a vessel powered by solar sails or ion engines . However , government budget cuts to NASA canceled the American efforts . The U.S. would have to make do primarily with Earth-based observations and the sharing of data from other nations , though an instrument named the Dust Counter and Mass Analyzer ( DUCMA ) , designed by Chicago University Professor John Simpson , was added on the Soviet mission in May of 1984 . The Soviets ' answer to Halley were the VEGAs . Instead of building an entirely new craft for the mission , the Soviets decided to modify their VENERA bus design to encounter the comet while performing an advanced Venus mission along the way . As VEGA 1 and 2 reached Venus , the buses would drop off one lander/balloon each and use the mass of the shrouded planet to swing them towards comet Halley , much as the U.S. probe MARINER 10 used Venus to flyby Mercury eleven years earlier . The Soviet craft would then head on to Halley , helping to pinpoint the location of the comet 's erupting nucleus for the GIOTTO probe to dive in only 605 kilometers ( 363 miles ) away in March of 1986 . As planned , the two VEGAs arrived at Venus in June of 1985 . VEGA 1 released its payload first on the ninth day of the month , the lander making a two-day descent towards the planet . The craft touched the upper atmosphere on the morning of June 11 . Sixty-one kilometers ( 36.6 miles ) above the Venerean surface a small container was released by the lander , which produced a parachute at 55 kilometers ( 33 miles ) altitude . Thus the first balloon probe ever to explore Venus had successfully arrived . One kilometer after the opening of the parachute , helium gas was pumped into the Teflon-coated plastic balloon , inflating it to a diameter of 3.54 meters ( 11.68 feet ) . Dangling on a tether thirteen meters ( 42.9 feet ) below was the instrument package , properly known as an aerostat . The top part of the 6.9-kilogram ( 15.18-pound ) aerostat consisted of a cone which served as an antenna and tether attachment point to the balloon . Beneath it was the transmitter , electronics , and instruments . Connected at the bottom was a nephelometer for measuring cloud particles . The aerostat was painted with a special white finish to keep at bay the corroding mist of sulfuric acid which permeated the planet 's atmosphere . The VEGA 1 balloon was dropped into the night side of Venus just north of the equator . Scientists were concerned that the gas bag would burst in the heat of daylight , so they placed it in the darkened hemisphere to give the craft as much time as possible to return data . This action necessitated that the landers come down in the dark as well , effectively removing the camera systems used on previous missions . The author wonders , though , if they could have used floodlights similar to the ones attached to VENERA 9 and 10 in 1975 , when Soviet scientists had thought the planet 's surface was enshrouded in a perpetual twilight due to the permanently thick cloud cover . The first balloon transmitted for 46.5 hours right into the day hemisphere before its lithium batteries failed , covering 11,600 kilometers ( 6,960 miles ) . The threat of bursting in the day heat did not materialize . The VEGA 1 balloon was stationed at a 54-kilometer ( 32.4-mile ) altitude after dropping ballast at fifty kilometers ( thirty miles ) , for this was considered the most active of the three main cloud layers reported by PIONEER VENUS in 1978 . Indeed the balloon was pushed across the planet at speeds up to 250 kilometers ( 150 miles ) per hour . Strong vertical winds bobbed the craft up and down two to three hundred meters ( 660 to 990 feet ) through most of the journey . The layer 's air temperature averaged forty degrees Celsius ( 104 degrees Fahrenheit ) and pressure was a mere 0.5 Earth atmosphere . The nephelometer could find no clear regions in the surrounding clouds . Early in the first balloon 's flight , the VEGA 1 lander was already headed towards the Venerean surface . Both landers were equipped with a soil drill and analyzer similar to the ones carried on VENERA 13 and 14 in 1982 . However , VEGA 1 would become unable to report the composition of the ground at its landing site in Rusalka Planitia , the Mermaid Plain north of Aphrodite Terra . While still ten to fifteen minutes away from landing , a timer malfunction caused the drill to accidentally begin its programmed activity sixteen kilometers ( 9.6 miles ) above the surface . There was neither any way to shut off the instrument before touchdown nor reactivate it after landing . This was unfortunate not only for the general loss of data but also for the fact that most of Venus was covered with such smooth low-level lava plains and had never before been directly examined . Nevertheless , the surface temperature and pressure was calculated at 468 degrees Celsius ( 874.4 degrees Fahrenheit ) and 95 Earth atmospheres respectively during the lander 's 56 minutes of ground transmissions . A large amount of background infrared radiation was also recorded at the site . As had been done when the drills and cameras on VENERA 11 and 12 had failed in December of 1978 , the Soviets focused on the data returned during the lander 's plunge through the atmosphere . The French-Soviet Malachite mass spectrometer detected sulfur , chlorine , and possibly phosphorus . It is the sulfur - possibly from active volcanoes - which gives the Venerean clouds their yellowish color . The Sigma 3 gas chromatograph found that every cubic meter of air between an altitude of 48 and 63 kilometers ( 28.8 and 37.8 miles ) contained one milligram ( 0.015 grain ) of sulfuric acid . The VEGA 1 data on the overall structure of the cloud decks appeared to be at odds with the information from PIONEER VENUS . The case was made even stronger by the fact that VEGA 2 's results nearly matched its twin . The VEGAs found only two main cloud layers instead of the three reported by the U.S. probes . The layers were three to five kilometers ( 1.8 to 3 miles ) thick at altitudes of 50 and 58 kilometers ( 30 and 34.8 miles ) . The clouds persisted like a thin fog until clearing at an altitude of 35 kilometers ( 21 miles ) , much lower than the PV readings . One possibility for the discrepan- cies may have been radical structural changes in the Venerean air over the last seven years . When the lander and balloon finally went silent , the last functioning part of the VEGA 1 mission , the flyby bus , sailed on for a 708 million-kilometer ( 424.8 million-mile ) journey around the Sun to become the first probe to meet comet Halley . On March 6 , 1986 , the bus made a 8,890-kilometer ( 5,334-mile ) pass at the dark and icy visitor before traveling on in interplanetary space . The Soviets had accomplished their first mission to two celestial bodies with one space vessel . On June 13 , VEGA 2 released its lander/balloon payload for a two-day fall towards Venus . Like its duplicate , the VEGA 2 balloon radioed information back to the twenty antennae tracking it on Earth for 46.5 hours before battery failure on the morning side of the planet . During its 11,100-kilometer ( 6,660-mile ) flight over Venus , the second balloon entered in a rather still environment which became less so twenty hours into the mission . After 33 hours mission time the air became even more turbulent for a further eight hours . When the balloon passed over a five- kilometer ( three-mile ) mountain on the `` continent '' of Aphrodite Terra , a powerful downdraft pulled the craft 2.5 kilometers ( 1.5 miles ) towards the surface . Temperature sensors on the VEGA 2 balloon reported that the air layer it was moving through was consistently 6.5 degrees Celsius ( 43.7 degrees Fahrenheit ) cooler than the area explored by the VEGA 1 balloon . This was corroborated by the VEGA 2 lander as it passed through the balloon 's level . No positive indications of lightning were made by either balloon , and the second aerostat 's nephelometer failed to function . The VEGA 2 lander touched down on the northern edge of Aphrodite Terra 's western arm on the fifteenth of June , 1,500 kilometers ( 900 miles ) southeast of VEGA 1 . The lander 's resting place was smoother than thought , indicating either a very ancient and worn surface or a relatively young one covered in fresh lava . The soil drill was in working order and reported a rock type known as anorthosite-troctolite , rare on Earth but present in Luna 's highlands . This rock is rich in aluminum and silicon but lacking in iron and magnesium . A high degree of sulfur was also present in the soil . The air around VEGA 2 measured 463 degrees Celsius ( 865.4 degrees Fahrenheit ) and 91 Earth atmospheres , essentially a typical day ( or night ) on Venus . Far above the VEGA 2 lander , its carrier bus sped past Venus at a distance of 24,500 kilometers ( 14,700 miles ) and followed its twin to comet Halley , making a closer flyby on March 9 , 1986 at just 8,030 kilometers ( 4,818 miles ) . Both probes helped to reveal that the comet is a very dark and irregular-shaped mass about fourteen kilometers ( 8.4 miles ) across , rotating once every 53 hours , give or take three hours . Since both VEGA craft were still functioning after their Halley encounters , Soviet scientists considered an option to send the probes to other celestial objects . One prime target was the near- Earth planetoid 2101 Adonis , which VEGA 2 could pass at a distance of six million kilometers ( 3.6 million miles ) . Sadly , the Soviets had to back out on the opportunity to become the first nation to fly a spacecraft past a planetoid when it was discovered that there was not enough maneuvering fuel in the probe to reach Adonis as planned . VEGA 1 and 2 were quietly shut down in early 1987 . Future Plans Diverted The impressive VEGA mission had given some scientists numerous ideas and hope for even more ambitious expeditions to the second world from the Sun . One example was the VESTA mission , planned for the early 1990s . This Soviet-French collaboration called for the launch of multiple probes on a single PROTON rocket in either 1991 or 1992 . The craft would first swing by Venus and drop off several landers and balloon probes . The aerostats would be designed to survive in the planet 's corrosive atmosphere for up to one month , a large improvement over the VEGA balloons ' two days . The mission would then head out to investigate several planetoids and comets , including a possible landing on Vesta ( thus the mission name ) , the most reflective Main Belt planetoid as seen from Earth . Unfortunately for Venus exploration , plans began to change in the Soviet Union . In 1986 the Soviets decided to reroute the VESTA mission to the red planet Mars instead of Venus , keeping the comet and planetoid aspects intact . By this time in the Soviet space program interest was focusing on Mars . Already under construction was an entirely new probe design called PHOBOS . Two members of this class were planned to leave Earth in 1988 and orbit Mars the next year . PHOBOS 1 and 2 would then place the first instruments on Mars ' largest moon , Phobos . All this was a prelude to even more advanced Mars expeditions , including balloon probes , rovers , soil sample return craft , and eventually human explorers in the early Twenty-First Century . The environment of Venus was just too hostile for any serious consideration of human colonization in the near future . But things began to look bleak for Soviet Venus and Mars exploration . Both PHOBOS probes failed to complete their missions , one losing contact on the way to the Red Planet in 1988 and the other going silent in Mars orbit just one week before the planned moon landing in March of 1989 . In 1989 a plan was devised for a Venus orbiter to drop eight to ten penetrators around the planet in 1998 . Several years later the mission launch date was moved to the year 2005 and has now been put on indefinite hold . No other official Soviet missions to Venus have since been put forth , a sad commentary after twenty-five years of continuous robotic exploration of the planet . During the late 1980s a drastic political and economic change was taking over the Soviet Union . President Mikhail Gorbachev began to `` open up '' his nation to the benefits of increased cooperation with the rest of the nations , particularly those in the West . While the culture became less oppressive than in the past , the economy was taking a very rough ride as it also underwent the effects of a `` free market '' . These effects hit everywhere , including the space program . Missions at all levels were cut back . The Soviets began making almost desperate attempts to cooperate with other space-faring nations either to keep their remaining programs alive or just to make money . In early 1992 it was reported that the Soviets were offering for sale several fully-equipped VENERAs they had in storage for the price of 1.6 million dollars each , an incredibly low price for any planetary probe . No nation took them up on the bargain . Meanwhile the United States was gearing up for new Venus missions of their own . MAGELLAN and GALILEO The U.S. reactivated their long-dormant planetary exploration with the launch of the Space Shuttle ATLANTIS on May 4 , 1989 . Aboard the Shuttle was the MAGELLAN spacecraft , a combination of spare parts from other U.S. probes designed to make the most detailed and complete radar-mapping of Venus in history . When MAGELLAN reached the second world in August of 1990 , it would be able to map almost the entire planet down to a resolution of 108 meters ( 360 feet ) , surpassing the abilities of VENERA 15 and 16 . In the interim another American probe was launched from a Space Shuttle which would make a quick flyby of Venus on its way to orbit the giant planet Jupiter in 1995 . On October 18 , 1989 , the Shuttle ATLANTIS released its second unmanned planetary probe into space , named GALILEO after the famous Italian astronomer who discovered the probe 's primary target 's major moons in 1610 . In the absence of a powerful enough booster to send GALILEO on a direct flight to the Jovian planet , the probe was sent around Venus and Earth several times to build up enough speed to reach Jupiter . As a result , Venus became GALILEO 's first planetary goal in February of 1990 . The probe radioed back images of the planet 's swirling clouds and further indications of lightning in that violent atmosphere . On the Drawing Boards With the incredible success of MAGELLAN in the last few years , new plans have been laid out for further journeys to Venus . Scien- tists in the U.S. have talked to space scientists in the former Soviet Union - now the Commonwealth of Independent States since January 1 , 1992 - of a cooperative effort to launch new VENERA lander missions within in the next decade . Japan , India , and the ESA have also considered their own Venus missions in the next few decades . In February of 1993 NASA came up with several new Venus projects as part of their Discovery Program for launching inexpensive probes throughout the solar system . For Venus two missions were selected for further study : A Venus Multiprobe Mission involving the landing of fourteen small probes over one hemisphere to measure winds , air temperature , and pressure ; and the Venus Composition Probe , designed to study Venus ' atmosphere while descending through the thick air with the aid of a parachute , much as the Soviets had done since 1967 . Final project decisions will be made in 1994 . Humans on Venus Will a human ever be able to stand on the surface of Venus ? At present the lead-melting temperatures and crushing air pressure would be threatening to any Earth life not protected in something even tougher than a VENERA lander . Plans have been looked into changing the environment of Venus itself into something more like Earth 's . However , it should be noted that any such undertaking will require the removal of much of the thick carbon dioxide atmosphere , a major reduction in surface heat , and the ability to speed up the planet 's rotation rate to something a bit faster than once every 243 Earth days . Such a project may take centuries if not millennia . In the meantime efforts should be made to better understand Venus as its exists today . We still have yet to fully know how a world so seemingly similar to Earth in many important ways became instead such a deadly place . Will Earth ever suffer this fate ? Perhaps Venus holds the answers . Such answers may best be found through international cooperation , including the nation which made the first attempts to lift the cloudy veils from Venus .

No doubt this accounts for a significant amount of the time as government efficiency in spending our tax dollars would certainly seek its absolute minimum in such an event . But my gut instinct says there is more at hand . It took some careful preplanning to demonize D.K . to such an extent . The attack meshes well with more restrictive gun control legislation that seems to be the agenda of the day . It also fits a pattern of increased government interference in personal religious beliefs .

But I am reminded of Senator Frank Church's remark that `` secrecy is the trademark of a totalitarian government .

Which Sony do you have ? ? I have a 27 '' SXR ( pre-XBR series , circa 1987 ) . That damn thing used to make noise like a mad-man . I had/have 2 separate problems ... one being the flyback , the other was the assembly where the windings of the yoke came together . First : I found by poking around the windings on that assembly , the thing would make noise . I guess that there was enough of a potential in that assembly to leak , so I sprayed it with a dielectric insulation spray -- I think it was urethane or acyrilic . That fixed it . Second : Flyback ... for the life of me , I ca n't isolate this one . If I leave the cover off , the TV will be quiet . If I put the cover back on , and let it heat up , it 'll start to whine -- kinda hard to solve with the cover on ! ! : - ( A friend of mine who used to fix TV 's says there might be a pin-hole leak somewhere on the flyback . Usually it 's surrounded by a bunch of black dust/dirt . I hope this is a start ... if you find something out , let me know ! aaron

That said , one could draw a parallel between > the Russians in Turkestan , and the Serbs in Bosnia . A typical Nazi/racist Armenian of 'ASALA/SDPA/ARF ' . Can it be that criminal/Nazi Armenians of ASALA/SDPA/ARF hate Muslims for ideological reasons regardless of what they do ? Between 1914 and 1920 , your criminal Armenian grandparents committed unheard-of crimes , resorted to all conceivable methods of despotism , organized massacres , poured petrol over babies and burned them , raped women and girls in front of their parents who were bound hand and foot , took girls from their mothers and fathers and appropriated personal property and real estate . And today , they put Azeris in the most unbearable conditions any other nation had ever known in history . Source : The Times , 2 March 1992 CORPSES LITTER HILLS IN KARABAKH ANATOL LIEVEN COMES UNDER FIRE WHILE FLYING WITH AZERBAIJANI FORCES TO INVESTIGATE THE MASS KILLINGS OF REFUGEES BY ARMENIAN TROOPS ... As we swooped low over the snow-covered hills of Nagorno-Karabagh we saw the scattered corpses . Apparently , the refugees had been shot down as they ran . An Azerbaijani film of the places we flew over , shown to journalists afterwards , showed DOZENS OF CORPSES lying in various parts of the hills . The Azerbaijanis claim that AS MANY AS 1000 have died in a MASS KILLING of AZERBAIJANIS fleeing from the town of Khodjaly , seized by Armenians last week . A further 4,000 are believed to be wounded , frozen to death or missing ... Seven of us squatted in the cabin of an Azerbaijani M24 attack helicopter as we flew to investigate the claims of the mass killings . Suddenly there was a thump against the underside of the aircraft , a red flash of tracer ripped past the starboard wing , and the helicopter rocked sharply . We swung round , and there was a deafening burst of fire from the cannon under our wing as the helicopter crew returned fire . We had been fired on from an Armenian anti-aircraft post . We swung round again , tipped to starboard and appeared to dive straight down into a valley . The brown earth swooped around our heads , the helicopter swung round again and followed the contours of the ground . Our cannon fired repeated blasts . Later it emerged that a civilian helicopter that we had been escorting had landed successfully at Nakhichevanik in the east of the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh , to pick up some of the dead . We had , in fact , been attacked both by ground fire and by an Armenian helicopter . I had seen the Armenian helicopter intermittently through the window , its cannons firing , but had thought - mistakenly - that it was on '' our side '' . Our group of Western journalists had embarked on a search-and-rescue flight that had become a combat mission . Our flight consisted of the civilian passenger helicopter and two M24 Soviet attack helicopters in the Azerbaijani service , nicknamed flying crocodiles for their armour . Our party was in the second crocodile . The civilian helicopter 's job was to land in the mountains and pick up bodies at sites of the mass killings . The attack helicopters were there to give covering fire if necessary . The operation showed a striking sign of the disintegration of the Soviet armed forces because our pilot was a Russian officer . An Azerbaijani official told us that there were now five former Soviet military helicopters -and their pilots- fighting for Azerbaijan . `` They have signed contracts to fly for us , '' he said . The helicopter we engaged in combat was most probably flown by a brother-officer of our Russian pilot , but fighting for the Armenians . We had taken off just before 5pm on Saturday from Agdam airfield , an heated for the Armenian-controlled mountains of Karabakh , a sheer white wall in the distance . The civilian helicopter picked up four corpses , and it was during this and a previous mission that an Azerbaijani cameraman filmed the several the several dozen bodies on the hillsides . We then took off again in a hurry and speed back towards Azerbaijani lines . Azerbaijani gunners on the last hill before the plain - and safety - gazed up at us as we passed . Back at the airfield in Agdam , we took a look the bodies the civilian helicopter had picked up . Two old men a small girl were covered with blood , their limbs contorted by the cold and rigor mortis . They had been shot . What did our Russian pilot think of the tragedy , our close shave , and the war in Nagorno-Karabakh ? He gave us CHEERFUL GRIN , POLITELY DECLINED TO ANSWER QUES TIONS , AND MARCHED OFF TO HIS DINNER .

Nntp-Posting-Host : apache.utdallas.edu Organization : Univ . of Texas at Dallas Lines : 34 ==== BEGIN REPOST ==== IBM , Apple , Motorola Ready to Unwrap PowerPC 601 Processor The wraps will come off the PowerPC 601 processor this week , as Motorola Corp. , IBM , and Apple Computer Inc. detail the results of their yearlong effort . This first in a series of PowerPC processors will be a 32-bit processor with a 64-bit memory interface , much like Intel Corp.'s Pentium , with the capability of performing as many as three instructions per clock cycle , according to sources familiar with the chip . Motorola is expected to release the chip in volume by year end in two configurations , running at 50 and 66 MHz with performance of 40 and 50 SPECint89 marks , respectively , sources said . Floating-point performance for the 3.6-volt processors will be even better , as their SPECfp89 performance will be 60 and 80 , respectively . The 601 , a scaled-down version of the Power 220 chip developed by IBM for its RS/6000 workstations , will also include a 32K single buffered cache on the chip with protocols to support Motorola 's 64-bit multiprocessor 88110 bus built in . The chip , which is being designed initially to support the Micro Channel Architecture , is bus independent , so vendors could develop PowerPC- based systems using a number of different architectures , including ISA , EISA , or Sun Microsystems Inc. 's S-bus design , one source noted . According to sources familiar with the development effort , Motorola has been extremely successful in developing the PowerPC as an inexpensive architecture , despite a complex design made up of more than 2.8 million transistors using a 0.6-micron technology . Initial chips are expected to be priced from $ 300 to $ 400 -- only slightly higher than Intel Corp.'s 486 processors -- but could be sold profitably for less than $ 100 , one source said . ==== END REPOST ====

There are five inputs signals : RD , DSR , DCD , CTS , and RI . There are many differnt null modem requiremts as dictated by the software . The IBM BIOS requires asserts DTR and RTS and then waits for both DSR and CTS before sending . When a BIOS recieve call is made , it asserts DTR and waits for DSR to become true ( times out after a while and returns with an error if DSR never becomes true ) . It requires CTS to be true for sending AND recieving . Most communications packages bypass this and replace it with their own protocol . The key is that each comm . package could very well have different requirements . My favorite cable works in many cases : short RTS to CTS at each end , but also run RTS through to DCD at the opposite end . TD runs through to RD and DTR runs through to DSR from both DTE 's and of course SG goes through to SG . I have never had trouble with this null modem even though I have used it with a comm . package that was expecting RTS to go to CTS instead of DCD . The advantage of this cable is that it also works with the IBM BIOS . Gordon Lang

Another guy here was using a different kind of mouse and was using 640x400x16 video driver ( the default VGA for Windows ) . He has an S3 LocalBus card like I do and when I loaded the S3 video driver in Windows for him , his mouse became jumpy too . Seems like it is the S3 driver ! Is there any newer one than version 1.4 that would solve this problem ? It is really bad . I have to use the keyboard instead sometimes !

The Swiss took the lead after Hakan Ahlund made an incredibly stupid drop pass at his own blue line , and Celio came in alone with Soderstrom and beat Tommy to the stick side . The Swedes continued to make mistakes as Howald was allowed to skate in between the Swedish D and put the puck past Tommy to make it 0-2 . 0-3 was a nice one , Howald entered the Swedish zone , slammed on the breaks , and his shot went in by Tommy 's far post . One of the lousiest periods I 've seen Sweden play this year . Second period saw a new Swedish team , and the Swiss had to ice the puck many times . On a pp , Nylander skated in from the boards , Pavoni made the initial save , but Peter Andersson scored on the rebound . Then a power play goal from the Swiss , a slap shot from the blue line hit two players on the way to the goal and past Soderstrom also . Jonas Bergqvist made it 2-4 after a nice pass from Naslund behind the goal . Jan Larsson reduced the lead to 3-4 just before the end of 2nd period , on a pp skated in unattacked in front of the goal , and put the puck through Pavoni 's 5-hole . Third period , Sweden equalized on a slap shot from Renberg that trickled through Pavoni 's 5-hole . Then , another defensive mistake by the Swedes , Waeger was allowed to skate around the Swedish goal unattacked and from close range could make it 4-5 . Hollenstein then scored 4-6 on a 2-on-1 break away , and put it top shelf with no chance for Soderstrom .

Galley took a slap shot that found Dineen by the far post , and Dineen just deflected the puck past Trefilov in the Russian goal . Then a power play goal , after a couple of deflections Eric Lindros found Kariya alone by the far post , and Kariya put the puck high over a sliding Trefilov . Russia won the shots in the first period 12-5 , and they had the most of the scoring opportunities , but they just could n't score . Second period saw Lindros scoring his 10th ( ! ! ) goal of the WC . Kariya entered the Russian zone , slammed on the break to get past his defenseman , then made a nice pass to Corson who just got the stick on the puck to deflect it to Lindros who one-timed the puck . The Russians then finally got their goal , Karpov broke in from the side and made a slap shot in Tugnutt 's top right hand corner . Player of the game in Canada was voted Paul Kariya , and for Russia Valeri Karpov . I agree , the difference in this game was Lindros and Kariya , and in part also Tugnutt . Kariya had a far better game now than vs the Swedes , and he was very impressive . Kariya got the place in the line with Lindros after Mike Gartner went out with a rib-injury early in the first period . Lindros , BTW , lead the point scoring with 14 pts ( 9+5 ) before this game , 7 pts ahead of the next player ! i.e . double as much as the next player ( among those Kariya with 1+6 ) .

How about the discussion of the STS Tether experiment . Ran forward , it would suck energy from the Earth 's magnetic field , while trivially slowing the Shuttle . It could also have run backward -- if they ran electricity through the tether the other way , it would have trivially propelled the Shuttle faster . But an even better example comes to mind .

Sex , or Christianity ? I 'm afraid I see that question as very tendentious . Try rephrasing it : What 's more important to Christians ? Love of God or love of other human beings ? to which of course the only conceivable answer is that the one is like the other . I am *deeply* suspicious of any `` flavor '' of Christianity which would elevate one clause of the Great Commandment to a `` priority '' over the other such as to claim a conflict . True , we are told to let the dead bury the dead , to `` hate '' family rather than let it keep us from following Christ . But the dichotomy here is not one between love of our fellows and love of God , but of allowing *social* constructs to blind us to the presense of God . It is particularly satanic to twist love of God in such a manner as to become an excuse to treat others as on a different level than the one who is so caught up in `` love '' of God . The trouble comes in the relation of human love and human sex . Yes , it has sometimes been the case that the Church has `` taught '' that all sex was nasty , evil , sinful stuff . But when man and wife leave their parental homes to become helpmates , living in one flesh , it is the sex that is the vehicle of becoming `` one flesh '' ( if you doubt me , read St. Paul on what is wrong with frequenting prostitutes : - ) ) . Less provocatively , what I mean is just this : sexual bonding is a deeply founded aspect of our social interaction , and in particular is the foundation of the institution of marriage , so that unlike with many mammals , human males remain with and foster the children they beget and support their children 's mothers . This is the schema behind Genesis 2:18-24 ( and behind Jesus ' citation of that passage . ) [ I observe , by the way , that not all human males in fact do as I have just described ; but another thing that characterizes human societies is our raising of *non*begotten children , not only orphans and adoptees and the like , but products of the quite common infidelities of humans to their spouses . We are in this not unique in the animal world , but the full extent of social consequences and implications is most intricate for us . ] Yes , of course it sometimes goes `` wrong '' -- like all else we do , it is infected with sin , and you find married `` couples '' where there is no bond , and people so deliriously addicted to the initial stages of sexual bond formation ( the `` infatuation '' , `` falling in love '' phase ) that they break any forming bond in order to keep stepping over the threshold of the deep unity God has prepared for us , and stepping back out again right away . Satan may indeed *use* sex as a very handy tool to corrupt human love -- but in the Edenic creation , that is not its nature , and with God 's grace under the power of Christ to make all things new it need not be a problem for Christians ( though we must be vigilant , even in Christ , as the devil is watchful , prowling around like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour . ) So , returning to the original question , what is more important to STRAIGHT Christians ? Sex , or Christianity ? Paul , clearly , tended to think that sex was at best a distraction from Christianity ( though to be charitable to him , his context was in expectation of immediate parousia , so that the hard TASKS of a married union -- the lifelong building and adaptation to each other -- seemed somehow to undercut the `` proper '' preparation for an immediate eschaton . Since we *do not* know the hour of return , we should act *both* with instant readiness for that *and* with a commitiment to our mates that proposes a long lifetime together . And telling people *not* to bond in such a perspective strikes me as crippling us in the second clause of the the commandment to love . I would claim that only a very few saints have the CAPACITY to deeply love ( without sexual tinges or complication , mind you ) their fellow human beings unless they have had a deeply spiritual life in married union growing together as one flesh -- and that means in the type case , with a persistent and continued sexual relationship . We are human , and little good comes of trying to `` mortify the flesh '' to the point of pretending to be otherwise , pretending NOT to be sexual beings . > Christianity I would hope . Would they be willing to forgo sex > completely , in order to avoid being a stumbling block to others , It depends entirely on context . If that context is major hypocrisy on the part of those who find us `` stumbling blocks '' I am much less of a mind to efface myself so that they can pontificate about MY sins . There are some people for whom a life of celibacy is a spritual gift , and maybe even a victory against a to-them troubling sexual urge that seems to them to lead only to sin . Nothing I say should ever be read as demeaning such a gift . Nor the even rarer gift of love for all our conspecifics , and indeed for all God 's creation , that can develop to the full *without* the tutoring of a spousal/helpmate marriage founded in sex . But there is a difference between spiritual gifts and penance ; telling people that they HAVE to have a particular gift ( or else ? what ? ) is fraught with manipulation and disregard of the differences of our spiritual endowments from God . To one person is given the gift of speaking in toungues , to another intepretation of toungues ; to yet another prophecy ; and to still another teaching . The notion that some *particular* gift is required of *all* is one of the earliest heresies . -- Michael L.

The medical examiner saying he has n't seen something is *not* the same thing as saying that it is n't there .

Lines : 46 Hi , netters : We have a problem with 'makedepend ' : it does n't know how to correctly process # if clause in C preprocessor statements . It evaluates everything to true no matter what the conditionals are . For example , makedepend chokes on one of X11 include files ( as distributed by Sun ) - namely Xos.h : # if ! defined ( SUNOS41 ) || defined ( __STDC__ ) # include < string.h > # define index strchr # define rindex strrchr # else /* BSD & & ! __STDC__ */ # include < strings.h > # endif /* ! SUNOS41 || __STDC__ */ Here 'makedepend ' evaluates both # if and corresponding # else statements to 'true ' and tries to open the file < strings.h > which does n't exist under Solaris2 . We also have a lot of # if statements in some of our legacy code . We got and built 'makedepend ' off the net - it did n't fix the problem . In all fairness it should be noted that 'makdepend ' man-page ( Sun's distribution ) mentions this problem : BUGS If you do not have the source for cpp , the Berkeley C preprocessor , then makedepend will be compiled in such a way that all # if directives will evaluate to `` true '' regardless of their actual value . This may cause the wrong # include directives to be evaluated . Makedepend should simply have its own parser written for # if expressions .

This is no less logical than the assumption that if something is _not_ in the Bible , then it _must not_ be done . But I do n't really think that 's what he 's saying anyway . See below . > If slavery is immoral ( which I believe it is , can I assume that everyone > else in this group does too ? ) , why does n't Jesus or any of the apostles > speak out against it ? Owning slaves was common practice back then . Paul > speaks about everything else that is immoral . He apparently thought it > was important enough to talk about things like not being a drunkard . Why > does n't anyone mention slavery ? If God 's morals are eternal and don't > change like the morals of society , then it must have been just as immoral then > as it is today . What about the letter to Philemon ? In it Paul at least hints that a certain slave be released . Also , slavery in those times was not the same as the type of slavery we had in the U.S . I think a better comparison would be to indentured servitude . I do n't really want to get into a discussion on slavery . Anyway , although it does demonstrate your point , I do n't think it is relevent , because the original poster did not say that absence of specific condemenation proves something is not immoral . Back to the original poster 's assertion . He is not in fact making the logical error of which you accuse him . He stated the fact that the Bible does not say that babies can not be baptized . Also , we know that the Bible says that _everyone_ must be baptized to enter Heaven . _Everyone_ includes infants , unless there is other Scripture to the contrary , i.e . an exception . Since there is no exception listed in the Bible , we must assume ( to be on the safe side ) that the Bible means what it says , that _everyone_ must be baptized to enter Heaven . And so we baptize infants . To summarize , you accused the original poster of saying if something is not forbidden by the Bible , then that proves it is OK ; i.e . if something can not be disproven , it is true . He rather seemed to be asserting that since the Bible does not forbid , _you can not prove_ , using the Bible , that it is _not_ OK . There is a difference between proving whether or not something can be proven or disproven ( there are theories on provability in the field of Logic , by the way ) and actually proving or disproving it . The other logical error we must avoid falling into is the converse : that if something can not be proven , then it is false . This seems to be the error of many _sola scriptura_ believers . I think the only thing that can be proven here is that one can not use Scripture alone to prove something either way about infant Baptism , although the evidence seems to me to favor it . - - - - - - - - - - Steve Creps , Indiana University creps @ lateran.ucs.indiana.edu

From : mikec @ sail.LABS.TEK.COM ( Micheal Cranford ) Subject : Re : Rawlins debunks creationism Summary : creationist nonsense Organization : Tektronix , Inc. , Beaverton , OR . Lines : 78 John E. King ( king @ ctron.com ) posts a whopping one liner : * `` The modern theory of evolution is so inadequate that it deserves to be * * treated as a matter of faith . '' -- Francis Hitching * I have a few points to make about the above posting . 1 . Science is not based on and does not consist of `` quotes '' from either real or alleged experts . Critical reasoning , evidence and ( if possible ) experimentation are necessary . Creationists frequently display a massive confusion about this by merely quoting both non-experts and experts alike ( some of the latter quotes are in fact false ) and steadfastly refusing to follow any kind of rigorous scientific procedure . This strongly suggests that ( a . ) their claims completely lack any scientific merit and ( b . ) they are aware of this fatal deficiency . Of course , you may not actually be a creationist and this may not be your real intent . 2 . You have failed to identify Hitching and the surrounding context of his statement . Why is that ? If Hitching is a scientific illiterate then the quote would merely display his profound ignorance of evolutionary biology . Creationists are frequently known to quote real scientists out of context and to fabricate statements that they subsequently attribute to legitimate scientists . Of course , you may not actually be a creationist and this may not be your real intent . 3 . Evidence supporting the alleged inadequacies of `` the modern theory of evolution '' would be a much more powerful argument than a contextless one line quote from an unidentified nobody . It is also important to note that disproving biological evolution does not automatically prove some alternate claims any more that disproving that the earth is shaped like a hockey puck proves that it is a hyperbolic paraboloid . Creationists seem rather fond of diving ( head first ) into this logical fallacy . Of course , you may not actually be a creationist and this may not be your real intent . 4 . Since evolution is central to virtually all of modern science , an attack on evolution ( either the fact or the theory ) really represents an attack on science . While the theory will unquestionably continue to evolve ( B^ ) the fact of evolution will not ever go away . Creationists lost the battle long ago ( more than 100 years in fact ) but are simply too willfully ignorant and irrational to acknowledge the fact . Of course , you may not actually be a creationist and you may not really be that ignorant . Warren Kurt vonRoeschlaub ( kv07 @ IASTATE.EDU ) asks : * Neither I , nor Webster 's has ever heard of Francis Hitchings . Who is he ? * I , like Hitchings , am not to be found in Webster 's B^ ) . Francis Hitchings is a scientifically illiterate creationist ( or perhaps he is just playing the part of one ) who wrote a quite ignorant book attacking evolution ( `` The Neck of the Giraffe '' ) . In that publication he quotes a creationist ( Jean Sloat Morton ) using the standard invalid creationist probability argument that proteins could not have formed by chance . Thus not only confusing abiogenesis with evolution ( the two are quite independent ) but also concluding with a `` non sequitur '' ( i.e . the conclusion `` does not follow '' ) . [ pp 70-71 ] Hitchings also misquotes Richard Lewontin in an effort to support creationism . [ pp 84 ] Hitchings book was reviewed by National Park Service ecologist David Graber in the Los Angeles Times ( and repeated in the Oregonian ) . The article was titled `` ` Giraffe ' sticks scientific neck out too far '' . Excerpts include : `` Francis Hitchings is not a biologist . '' `` He goes after Darwin like Mark Antony after Brutus . He flips from scientific reasoning to mysticism and pseudo-science with the sinuosity of a snake-oil salesman . '' `` He suggests a mystical ` organizing principle ' of life , using the similarity of organs in different creatures as evidence [ sic ] . '' Note that the last statement above is actually evidence FOR evolution not against it . If John E. King is quoting from this reviewed book it wouldn't surprise me much . It 's also interesting that King had nothing to add ( i.e . he only posted a quote ) .

Take a quick look at the book of Jeremiah and it is obvious ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ > that judgement prophecies can be valid . here in the US , it seems like > we might have more of a problem with positive prophecies , though I > am sure there may be a few people who are too into judgement . The words I have underlined are at the heart of the problem . A `` quick look '' does n't do justice to the depth of the book of Jeremiah . Having studied the Jeremiah/Ezekial period solidly for over a year at one stage of my life , I have to say that there is a great deal of underlying theological meaning in the judgement prophesies . Let me make one point . The clash between Jeremiah and the `` false prophets '' was primarily in the theological realm . The `` false prophets '' understood their relatioship to God to be based on the covenant that the Lord made with David . It is possible to trace within the pages of the Old Testament who this covenant , which was initially conditional on the continued obedience of David's descendants , came to be viewed as an unconditional promise on the part of the Lord to keep a descendant of David 's upon the throne and to never allow Jerusalem to subjegated by any foreign power . Jeremiah was not a Judahite prophet . He was from Anathoth , across the border in what had formerly been Israelite territory . When he came to prophesy , he came from the theological background of the covenant the Lord had made with Israel through Moses . The northern Kingdom had rejected the Davidic covenant after the death of Solomon . His theology clashed with the theology of the local prophets . It was out of a very deep understanding of the Mosaic covenant and an actute awareness of international events that Jeremiah spoke his prophesies . The `` judgement prophesies '' were deeply loaded with theological meaning . In my opinion , both the Portland earthquake prophesy and the David Wilkerson '' New York will burn '' prophesy are froth and bubble compared to the majestic theological depths of the Jeremiah prophesies . -- ___ Bill Rea ( o o ) -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -w -- U -- w -- - | Bill Rea , Computer Services Centre , | E-Mail b.rea @ csc.canterbury.ac.nz | | University of Canterbury , | or cctr114 @ csc.canterbury.ac.nz | | Christchurch , New Zealand | Phone ( 03 ) -642-331 Fax ( 03 ) -642-999 | -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -

X-Sender : newtout 0.08 Feb 23 1993 Lines : 19 Although the $ 1 billion scheme is a fantasy ( it 's an old canard in the space business called `` trolling for billionaires '' ) , there is a good chance that a much smaller program ( $ 65 million ) will pass the 103rd Congress . This is the Back to the Moon bill , put together by the people who passed the Launch Services Purchase Act . The bill would incent private companies to develop lunar orbiters , with vendors selected on the basis of competitive bidding . There is an aggregate cap on the bids of $ 65 million . Having a single rich individual paying billions for lunar missions is probably worse than having the government bankroll a $ 65 million program , as the Delta Clipper program has shown ( DC-X was funded by SDIO at $ 59 million ) . We have a clear chance of making a lunar mission happen in this decade - as opposed to simply wishing for our dreams to come true . Please support the Back to the Moon bill .

I could n't remember doing anything that would have caused it . That is , I had n't been lifting more than other people do , and in fact probably somewhat less . Eventually the thing became more painful and I had the repair operation . This year I developed a pain on the other side . This turned out to be another inguinal hernia . So I go back to the hospital Monday for another fun 8- ) operation . I do n't know of anything I 'm doing to cause this to happen . I 'm 38 years old and I do n't think I 'm old enough for things to start falling apart like this . The surgeon who is doing the operation seems to suspect a congenital weakness , but if so , why did it suddenly appear when I was 37 and not really as active as I was when I was younger ? Does anyone know how to prevent a hernia , other than not lifting anything ? It 's rare that I lift more than my 16-month-old or a sack full of groceries , and you may have noticed that your typical grocery sack is fairly small these days . Is there some sort of exercise that will reduce the risk ? Of course , my wife thinks it 's from sitting for long periods of time at the computer , reading news ... -- J.

This may sound argumentative , but do the pro-homosexual crowd give the same support to church members that are involved in incestuous relationships ? If we do a little substitution above , we get : '' although by no means all episcopalians are sympathetic to incestuous men and women , there certainly is a fairly larget percentage ( in my experience ) who are . I am good friends with an episcopalian minister who is ordained and living in a monogamous incestual relationship . This in no way diminishes his ability to minister -- in fact he has a very significant ministry with the Incest association of his community ... '' Do the same standards apply ? If not , why not ? And while we 're in the ballpark , what about bestiality ? I ca n't recall offhand if there are any direct statements in the Bible regarding sex with animals ; does that activity have more or less a sanction ? Please avoid responses such as `` you 're taking this to extremes '' . I would guess that a disproportionate percentage of the inerrant Bible community views homosexual acts with distaste in the same manner that society at large views incest . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Scott Cokely | ( 714 ) 833-4760 scott.cokely @ nb.rockwell.com '' They came for the Davidians , but I did not speak up because I was not a Davidian .

That does n't mean that the same people would accept those substitutions . The question is whether the relationships involved do in fact form an appropriate vehicle to represent Christ 's relationship to humanity . This is at least *partly* an empirical question . In some cases types of human relationship have been rejected because over time they always seem to lead to trouble . I think that 's the case with slavery . One can argue that in theory , if you follow Paul's guidelines , it 's possible to have Christian slaveholders . But in practice , over a period of time , most people came to the conclusion that nobody can really have that degree of control over another and not abuse it . The message you were responding to was asking you to look at the results from Christian communities that endorse homosexuality . ( Note : Christian homosexuals , not people you see on the news advocating some extremist agenda ) . You may not want to base your decision completely on that kind of observation , but I would argue that it 's at least relevant . You ca n't answer the request by asking why you shouldn't look at the Incest association , because in fact there is no such association . If there were , it might be reasonable for you to look at it too . Of course that does n't mean that the results of all such examinations would necessarily come out the same way . Part of why there are n't groups pushing all possible relaxed standards is that some of them do produce obviously bad results . -- clh ]

Box 4079 ( 212 ) 944-9800 19O9 AB Amsterdam Norman Dorsen President Dear Mr. Chaum : Ira Glasser Executive Director Eleanor Holmes Norton CHAIR National Advisory Council Thank you for sending me a most interesting article . A society of individuals and organizations that would expend the time and resources to use a series of 'digital pseudonyms ' to avoid data linkage does not in my opinion make big brother obsolete but acts on the assumption that big brother is ever present . I view your system as a form of societal paranoia . As a matter of principle , we are working to enact formal legal protections for individual privacy rather than relying on technical solutions . We want to assume a society of law which respects legal limits rather than a society that will disobey the law , requiring citizens to depend on technical solutions . e.g . require a judical warrant for government interception of data communications rather than encrypt all messages on the assumption that regardless of the lawt the government will abuse its power and invade privacy . As a matter of practicality , I do not think your system offers much hope for privacy . First , the trend toward universal identifiers is as much.-a movement generated by government or industry 's desire to keep track of all citizens as it is by citizens seeking simplicity and convenience in all transactions . At best , your system would benefit the sophisticated and most would opt for simplicity . The poor and the undereducated would never use or benefit from it . Finally where there 's a will , there 's a way . If government wants to link data bases , it will , by law , require the disclosure of various individual pseudonyms used by citizens or prohibit it for data bases which the government wants to link . Since corporations make money by trading commercial lists with one another , they will never adopt the system or if it is adopted , will use `` fine printn contracts to permit selling various codes used by their customers to other firms . The solution remains law , policy , and consensus about limits on government or corporate intrusion into areas of individual autonomy . Technique can be used to enforce that consensus or to override it . It can not be used as a substitute for such consensus . Sincerely Yours , /Sig/ Jerry J.

No smiley on the part about atheism , I see . Do you realize that your statement says that I was mentioning `` nonsense '' about atheism ? This is hard for me to defend against if this is the claim you are making , as you have only included the last two sentences of my post and mentioned the first . Please address the substance of my post rather than rejecting it out of hand . But , because of the sometimes ambiguous nature of English , I may be misinterpreting your wording here . Please clarify : did you or did you not mean to call my statements about atheism `` nonsense '' ? If so , care to back up that claim ? > > Do I sound `` broken '' to you ? > > I answer in the affirmative . OK , then . Start up the amatuer psycology again . How am I `` broken '' ? > Is it politically correct for Christians to be the only besieged group > permitted the luxury of arrogance ? *YAWN* Excuse me , I do n't recall any portion of my post in which I called Christians arrogant quote me , if I did . I do remember calling Christianity '' silly '' and then following that up with information that I was nine years old when I thought that . I also said that I find faith to be intellectually dishonest and I would like to see some sort of proof of your god's existence . I define `` faith '' as `` belief in the absense of any proof '' , BTW . Also , I subscribe to a.a as I mentioned and we see fundies of all types there , so in answer to your question : `` no . '' Finally , I 'd hardly call Christianity `` beseiged '' in this country . I seldom see Christians ridiculed for merely practising their religion or wearing crosses or having Christian bumper stickers . I do n't know for sure , of course , I only say I have n't seen it happening . What I have seen happening is my homosexual and/or friends being beat up , or preached at by people who claim to be Christ 's followers . I know that this sort of thing isn't practiced by the majority of Christians , but it is a very vocal minority who are doing it and I do n't see comperable victimization of Christians . > Now I have a question for Bob . Why in the world would any self-respecting > atheist want to subscribe to a Christian news group ? The implication being that I am not self-respecting , of course . I 'm not a student of psychology , BTW , but I am a student of Creative Writing and Linguistics , so literary analysis _is_ my forte . Also , if the implications I see are improper , please let me know . I 'm here because I 'm not sequestered in my own little atheist cubbyhole as you seem to think atheists should be . Did it occur to you that I _don't_ think I know everything and that maybe someone will say something that will change my life ? Have you read my other posts here or did you see '' atheist '' and decide it was time to poke at someone who does n't deserve your respect ? Aw , geez . I 'm sorry , I probably am getting my back up a little too high , here . It 's just that the `` nonsense '' thing really annoys me . I figure you should see my first reactions , though , since they are my true reactions to your question . Now , the smoothed feather version : I seek all sorts of knowledge . That 's why I came to my university . Yes , I am looking at your religion ( well , sorta , I have no idea what *kind* of Christian you are ) from the outside , and hopefully with an objective view . I 've been trying to ask reasoned questions here , because I genuinely don't know the answers to them , but when I saw the question directed at atheists I figured I would answer . After all , you can speculate about atheist motives here all you want ( hence the `` amatuer '' psychology crack ) , but without an atheist , you ca n't be sure of even one atheist 's motive . I 'm hoping people really want to know and I was trying to show that I actually checked out several religions and I actually read all the pamphlets people have to offer and I actually think about these things . Instead , I 'm still faced with the implication that atheism is some kind of aberration and that only `` broken '' people are atheist . Try it from the flip side : I posit that atheism is the natural state and only broken people are theists . I offer as proof that so many people witness from horrible lives which picked up as soon as they discovered their religion , that religion is regional ( if people didn't follow the religion of their areas , there would be a more homogenous mix ) , so many terrorists claim theistic motives , and that theists tend to be so pushy and angry when challenged on alt.atheism . Why are religions so successful ? Because there is so much suffering in the world , which '' breaks '' people . It 's an uncomfortable situation whichever way you look at it , which is another reason I 'm here , to try to see the flip side of my thinking ( and also as a watchdog for logical fallacies : ) . > I have a > difficult enough time keeping up with it , and I think I know something ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ > about the subject . ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ The implication here being that atheists ca n't possibly know anything about Christianity . Probably jumping at shadows again , but I think my reaction is somewhat justified . After all , the first post suggested that atheists are `` broken '' , hostile people . This post confirms that someone else believes it . > > Bob reminds me of my roommate . In order to disbelieve atheism , he says ^^^^^^^^^^ > he will need to be proven wrong about it . Well , he got me there . I am a strong atheist , because I feel that lack of evidence , especially about something like an omnipotent being , implies lack of existence . However , I have n't met the strong atheist yet who said that nothing could ever persuade him . Call me a `` seeker '' if you like , I do n't . _Weak_ atheism is being ignore here , though . Some atheists simply say `` I do n't believe in any god '' rather than my position : `` I believe that no god ( s ) exist . '' For the weak atheist , the is no atheism to disbelieve , because they do n't actively believe in atheism . ( If you think this is confusing , try figuring out the difference between Protestants and Methodists from an atheist point of view : ) . This is another fallacy many theists seem to have , that everyone believes in something ( followed up by `` everyone has faith in something '' ) . Guess what ? My atheism ends the moment I 'm shown a proof of some god 's existence . Is that really too much to ask ? > Well , I do n't even waste my time trying . Well , I guess you wo n't succeed in converting him or me . Why the supposition that you will fail to convince him ? ( amatuer psycology on ) Is it because you yourself are unconvinced ? : ) > I tell him that he 'll just have to take my word for it . And I told you that I find faith to be intellectually dishonest . Note that I can only speak for myself . If you find faith to be honest , show me how . I have been unable to reconcile it so far . Maybe that 's how I 'm `` broken '' ? I tell you that I have invisible fairies living in my garden and that you should just take my word for it . If you accept that , you are of a fundamentally different mind than I and I really would like to know how you think . All I ask for is proof of the assertion `` God exists '' .

From : khoo @ husc15.harvard.edu Subject : Upgrading the processor on 386/486 machines Organization : Harvard University Science Center Lines : 43 In case anyone was wondering about upgrading their 386 or 486 class machine without spending a lot of money , I looked into replacing the processor on those machines and here are the facts ( as I understand them ) . If you have a PS/2 Model 70 or Model 80 , you can replace the i386 chip with either 1 ) a Cyrix 486DLC chip for $ 130 which will increase your processing power by about 60 % for normal fuctions , and not at all for math functions . This chip will only run at your original clock speed , ie . if you have a 16MHz machine the Cyrix 486DLC will run at 16MHz . note : Windows does not use the math functions , so it is a good upgrade if you are running Windows . Or , 2 ) you can get a Kingston 486/NOW platform for $ 450 with a 25MHz i486SX on it which will increase your normal processing power by about 100 % , if you were running at 25MHz originally . But again it will not increase the speed of your math fuctions . I think that it will continue to run at 25MHz even if your original processor runs at a slower speed . There is also 3 ) the Kingston 486/NOW platform for $ 750 with a 33MHz i486DX on it . This might speed up your math functions as well , but I am not sure . If you have a PS/2 Model 70 B21 or other PS/2 machine with either an i486SX or a non-clock doubling i486DX ( ie . it runs at either 25 or 33MHz ) in it , then you can get an Intel Overdrive chip ( which is really an i486DX2 chip ) and replace your chip with it . You should get about 95 % better preformance for both normal and math functions . The 25/50 Mhz version of the Overdrive chip costs $ 450 and the 33/66MHz version costs $ 700 . The replacement for the 25MHz 486SX chip is an espeacially good deal as it provides the math coprocessor which the 486SX does not have . Note that the speed ratings on the Overdrive chips are the maximum speed at which they can run . If you have a 20MHz 486SX , then the Overdrive chip will run at 20/40MHz , ie . 20MHz externally and 40MHz internally . There is no reason to buy an Overdrive chip which is rated at faster then your machine , you will not get faster performance . You should be able to buy these chips from any of the microchip merchants that advertise at the back of PC Magazine or PC Week . You might want to shop around as prices do vary . If you need a name/phone number for a source for a particular chip , e-mail me , and I will respond with a couple of sources .

Apologies to those who've seen the following before : ] To explain my position on the `` War On Drugs , '' I offer this : Drugs And Crime : A New Approach by Ken Barnes Given that : 1 . The trade in illegal drugs is responsible for much of the crime which afflicts our nation . 2 . People who want drugs ( particularly people who are predisposed to addiction ) will find a way to get them , whether or not they are legally available . 3 . Despite current law enforcement efforts , drugs are readily available to those who want them . 4 . Addiction to drugs , both legal and illegal , is responsible for a significant drain on the productive resources of our country , and this occurs in a variety of ways , from the cocaine-addicted babies who are unable to learn , to the spread of disease among addicts , to the tragic consequences of alcohol abuse and tobacco smoking . 5 . A general economic principle of government is that whatever is subsidized you get more of , and whatever is taxed you get less of . To be most effective in confronting the nation 's drug problem , some way must be found to utilize these additional powers of government to make drug dealing and drug use less attractive . While this country 's current efforts to combat legal drugs have succeeded in some respects , ( there is a greater awareness of the health consequences of smoking , and designated-driver programs have helped reduce drunk driving , for example ) , the same can not be said for the `` war '' on illegal drugs . There remains a core group of illegal drug users which support international networks of smugglers , pushers , growers , processors , kingpins , and gangsters . These networks and their `` marketing activities , '' which include drive- by shootings , corrupting law enforcement authorities , and smuggling weapons , are directly or indirectly responsible for a large proportion of the crimes committed in our country every day . Clearly , illegal drugs and rising crime are linked . It takes only a moment 's reflection to recognize how they are linked . The link is money . As with this country 's failed effort to prohibit alcohol consumption , a black market has been created , in which greedy local monopolies , like the gangsters of a bygone era , have profited enormously from their illegal trade . The victims of this trade include not only the innocent people unfortunate enough to be caught in the crossfire , but , I would argue , the drug users themselves . Were it not for the black market , and the violent monopoly of the drug lords , drug users might not be the thieves , robbers , prostitutes and murderers they have become in order to pay the high prices the drug lords demand . In the absence of the drug lords , most would be , I believe , simply people with a problem , either a moral problem_or_a medical problem , but_not_a criminal problem . Let me be clear however , I am_not_advocating that we let the criminals who have been preying on our society for these many years of Prohibition off the hook . On the contrary , the new approach I advocate is one which would not result in either the government or private industry getting into the business of promoting crack cocaine , or any other presently illegal drug for that matter . Neither is it an approach which sees law abiding citizens handing over more and more of their freedom and privacy in an effort to track down illegal drug users , until `` the land of the free and the home of the brave '' looks like a police state . Here then is my proposal : 1 . Possession and use of all presently illegal drugs is decriminalized , but buying and selling them remains illegal . 'Potheads ' can grow their own marijuana ( as many already do today ) , other drug users can legally import their poison of choice as long as they pay the tariffs , and a barter economy of drug experimenters develops . 2 . Because of the barter economy which supplies the drug users , the black market profits that have so enriched the drug lords dwindle . If these drugs can be obtained for 'free ' or next to nothing , why buy them ? Nevertheless , there will be those who will seek to sell these `` noncommercial '' drugs even at relatively low prices . Therefore , 3 . Law enforcement activity is concentrated on those individuals who continue to buy and sell , and also on the crimes committed by drug users too poor to afford even low prices . But here is where the strategy begins to differentiate between the drug dealers , the victimizers , and the drug users , their victims . 4 . Upon arrest for_any_crime , _suspects are permitted to choose whether or not they will undergo a drug test . Those who choose to cooperate are informed that upon conviction for the crime they are accused of , if they are found to be a drug user , they will be institutionalized until they are clean , and only then will they begin to serve their sentence . If they choose to cooperate and are already drug-free , they can begin to serve their sentence right away . Those who choose not to undergo the drug test and are convicted face stiffer fines and serve longer sentences . 5 . Institutionalization of drug using criminals serves several purposes : Drug using criminals ( and this includes drunk and/or 'stoned ' drivers ) are separated from their sources of supply , thus reducing the total number of drug users in society at large , and consequently decreasing the demand for drugs on the street , putting more of the remaining drug dealers out of business . Institutionalization provides an incentive for drug using criminals to straighten themselves out , before becoming part of the general prison population . While helping protect society from crime , institutionalization could also serve to deter drug users from becoming criminals , since drug using criminals , unlike other criminals , would be delayed prior to serving their sentences by the additional time it takes for them to sober up . Institutionalization of drug using criminals separate from the general prison population would also provide a closely monitored pool of addicts who could volunteer for research studies of new techniques and treatments for addictive disease , with the potential to benefit both themselves and others . 6 . Dealers in illegal drugs are generally not drug users themselves , and this is particularly true of the drug bosses or kingpins running large illicit organizations . Under this proposal , dealers would be more readily identifiable , since upon arrest they would presumably pass the drug test , or else decline to take it in order to avoid having to explain why they are in possession of drugs when it is apparent they do not use them . Declining to take the test , they would of course face stiffer penalties . While each case of attempted sale of a noncommercial drug would have to stand on own its merits , the outcome of a suspect 's drug test could provide additional evidence for the prosecution . 7 . Just as cigarette taxes have contributed to the decline of smoking in our country by making cigarettes more costly while at the same time providing revenue for anti-smoking campaigns , noncommercial drugs should be taxed , and the money generated should be used to combat their use . Enforcement of this tax should be on a voluntary basis however , and should not be used as an excuse to infringe on the rights and privacy of noncommercial drug users , since to do so would have the effect of reintroducing Prohibition . Instead , drug users will be encouraged to pay the tax by reminding them that if untaxed drugs are ever found in their possession during the course of routine police operations , they will be required to pay the tax immediately or else forfeit their untaxed drugs to be destroyed . If drug dealers are found to be selling noncommercial drugs on which taxes have not been paid , they will face additional prosecution for evading the tax . The strategy of adding tax evasion to drug dealing charges is already in use in some jurisdictions , but its effectiveness is currently limited by the illegality of drug possession . Revenue from drug possession taxes and import tariffs would be used to fund anti-drug advertising campaigns , and provide support to private sector drug treatment programs for those unable to afford treatment . 8 . Taxpayer subsidies to all drug producers must be ended . Federal support of tobacco farming is both immoral and wasteful in this era of tight budgets , and the marijuana crops grown illicitly on federal lands in many states must likewise be eliminated . While my proposal would have the effect of permitting the use of what are now illegal drugs , it would hold the users of all drugs responsible for their actions , and I believe , would reduce the harm drugs have on our society , particularly the crime caused by the illegal drug trade . So long as we remain a free nation , with relatively porous borders , and freedom for our citizens to travel , we will always have a drug problem . Whether it takes the form of heroin addicts dying in abandoned buildings , drunk drivers killing and maiming others on our streets , or emphysema patients struggling for breath after a lifetime of smoking , the results are the same : needless suffering and death . As a society we must recognize that while our society permits us to harm ourselves with drugs , as we are already doing ( regardless of the drug laws ) , we must take a stand against the harm that drugs and drug users cause to others . We must particularly oppose the vicious and violent cartels which prey on the weakness of drug users . By taking the profits out of their deadly trade , my proposal goes a long way towards shutting down these powerful criminal organizations . The question of whether drug use is a moral or medical problem depends on which group of drug users you 're talking about . Different drugs have different effects , and some are more addictive than others . The addictiveness of a drug also often varies between individuals , and so we have some people who can drink alcohol in moderation , while others find they can not resist the bottle . Nicotine , which former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop declared to be as addicting as heroin , is a legal drug with known harmful effects , and while some people can stop smoking by willpower alone , others continue to smoke even after treatment for lung cancer . For those individuals who can stop taking drugs on their own , we may argue that because they have chosen to use them , this represents a moral failure on their part , or an unwillingness to face the difficulties of life . But for the addicts , while they may have chosen to use drugs the first time , by the time they discover their addiction it is too late . We can not hold them responsible for their disease , any more than we would blame someone who is drowning for an inability to swim . Perhaps they should have known not to go near the water , or perhaps someone should have warned them of the danger , but in their present circumstances warnings will not help . Neither does it help for the drug dealers on the shore to be tossing them weights . -- Standard disclaimer -- *.x , *dna************************************************************** * ( == ) Ken Barnes , LifeSci Bldg . * Conservative libertarians * * \ ' KEBARNES @ memstvx1.memst.edu * for Pro-Balance ! * * ( - ) **Memphis , TN********75320.711 @ compuserve.com********************** '' I find television very educating .

The change in environment can cause problems . Anesthetic agents > can cause confusion because the body can not clear the medicines out of > the body as easily . The original poster did not say why his mother had been in hospital but I can answer a few general points . Elderly patients may exhibit a marked difficulty in coping after being in hospital for a few days . The drastic change of environment will often unmask how marginally they have been coping at home . Even young people find the change unsettling . Though we have thought that this decrement in function after - say - anaesthesia and surgery for a fractured hip ( a common event in the elderly ) was due to anaesthesia there is good evidence that the change of situation is much more important . Some hospitals have tried a 'rapid transit ' system for hip fractures , aiming to have the patient back at home within 24 hours of admission . The selection of the anaesthetic has no effect on the ability to discharge these patients early . Anaesthetists who work with the elderly ( which is almost all of us ) generally take care to tailor the choice and dose of drugs used to the individual patient . Even so , there is some evidence that full mental recovery may take a surprisingly long time to return . This is the sort of thing which is detected by setting quite difficult tasks , not the gross change that the original poster noted . Haloperidol ( Haldol TM ) is a long acting drug . The plasma half life of the drug is up to 35 hours . If the decanoate ( a sort of slow release formulation ) is used it may be weeks . The elderly are sensitive to haloperidol for a number of reasons . Without knowing more it is hard to comment . Don Mackie - his opinions esiology will disavow ...

Has anybody done a > study to determine how much time is actually `` wasted '' -- say , in these A's > games ? Oh , probably . Ms. Nichols has given the average game times ( and average runs scored ) for 1983 and 1992 . ( A very nice piece of information , Ms. Nichols . Who knows ? She may be listening , and not have me in her kill file after all . ) Those numbers indicate somewhere in the neighborhood of half-a-run *less* being scored per game , and the games taking 15 minutes *longer* . Something is being done now that was n't done ten years ago , which is extending the games by 15 minutes . Ms. Nichols thinks it 's more pitches . Given the increasing specialization of pitchers , it would n't surprise me . If it 's not simply more pitches , though , I do n't think it 's unreasonable to think that something can be done to get ten of those minutes back . Then I get a couple more from shortening the warmup time for a relief pitcher after he comes in , and a couple more still from enforcing existing rules , which have been stated in other posts in this thread ( and other related ones ) . The problem is , who decides whether that time is `` wasted ? '' You do n't seem to think it is at all . Right now , I think it is , although I have heard one case favoring giving the reliever all the warmups he thinks he needs ( the difference in mounds between the field and pen ) -- but who knows ? If the rules get changed , maybe something I did n't foresee will happen to change my mind . But you can bet a lot of minds would fail to foresee the same thing , or else nothing will be changed .

So , if the 1/r^2 law is incorrect ( assume some unknown material [ dark matter ? ? ] inhibits Gamma Ray propagation ) , could it be possible that we are actually seeing much less energetic events happening much closer to us ? The even distribution could be caused by the characteristic propagation distance of gamma rays being shorter then 1/2 the thickness of the disk of the galaxy . I believe the problem with this theory is that we see gamma-ray sources at that energy range and their energy does n't seem to be significantly absorbed .

This is due to a missing XRESOLUTION and YRESOLUTION tag which apparently is required ( or at least believed to be required ) for valid TIFF . I have checked both xv 2.x and xv 3.x and neither of these do indeed copy these tags . Has anyone out there hacked in the fixes for xv to support these tags ? I have been told that I could find some code in tiff/tools/tiffcp.c , but that directory is one of many of the tiff group not distributed with xv .

From the Pluto Fast Flyby Instrument definition research anouncemnet , the instrument payload constraints are : Mass allocation - 7 kilograms ( 15.4 lbs ) Power allocation - 6 watts Required instruments : Visible imaging system ( 1024x1024 CCD , 750 mm fl , f/10 optics ) IR mapping spectrometer ( 256x256 HgCdTe array , 0.3 % energy resolution ) UV spectrometer ( 55-200 nm , 0.5 nm resolution ) Radio science ( ultrastable oscilator incorporated in telecom system ) ultrastable means 10^-14 . This does n't leave much room for payloads which are totally unrelated to the mission of the spacecraft . In addition , the power will come from a radioisotope thermal generator , and the whole space craft will be about 2 feet in diameter , with no booms , which means there will be strong gamma-lines from Pu-239 and associated schmutz in the background , which tends to reduce sensitivity somewhat .

Nah , let 's reserve rec.sports.idiots for people who POST obvious flamebait , like yourself . If someone posts something as controversial ( not to mention idiotic ) as what Austin posted in a widely accessed newsgroup , someone should challenge the statement . There is a school of thought that suggests that silence = consent . Whereas this idea may not apply to everything in life , it certainly SHOULD apply to a forum of public discussion , which r.s.b . is . If you 've been reading r.s.b . lately , you 'll find that even elementary school children have had access to our postings , alibet in an edited form . It 's making me think a little more carefully about some of the things I post . In conclusion , if someone like Austin wants to post his drivel in some obscure newsgroup that I do n't read , fine . He 's got the right to rant , rave , and drool all he wants to in the name of free speech . But if he drools in a newsgroup that I read , then I will support the right of anyone to provide rebuttal to his drooling . Now , of course , you do n't have to read any of this .

For this reason , I am alarmed that not more Jews on the Net have spoken out against what Joachim has said . They have the chance to possibly change the anti-semitic views of some people on the net , to show them that all Jews do *not* hate all Arabs and Muslims , just like all Muslims do *not* hate all Jews .

And it is not Hirschbeck 's job to help Gant with any of these difficulties . If Gant ca n't gather his concentration for whatever reason , that just makes him all the more meat in the batter 's box . The umpire 's job is to maintain flow of play . Gant is not entitled to time to regather his faculties . Nor is anyone else . > Now , it 's pretty stupid to go ahead and talk the walk when the umpire is > telling you to get in there .

Gant had a reason > to want some time ( disputed strike call ) . If a disputed strike call is ample reason for a timeout , games would last about nine-fifteen weeks , if Jack Morris or Dave `` Whiner '' Stieb were pitching . A disputed strike call is not sufficient for a time out . Suck it up , get back in the box , and never badmouth the blue . They're not going to change their mind , and you 're just going to come across as a pinhead , which wo n't help you with the borderline calls . FTR - I never speak to umpires when I do n't know them personally , nor do I glance at them , or react to calls . As a result , I think I get more than my fair share of borderline calls at the plate , because I have a rep of having a good eye .

Obviously , Clinton is again trying to make policy for image purposes in America rather than to try to deal with the real problem and assume a share of responsibility for the problem . He obviously did n't even consult with the Macedonians ... he was just looking at the map of the former Yugoslavia for the safest place to put American troops so he could say to the Europeans ... hey , look , we have troops on the ground in the former Yugoslavia too ... now let me bomb so I can make it look like I am doing something in the American media . The problem is that the blue berets in Bosnia are dead meat if Clinton starts bombing , but Clinton does n't have the courage to ask that the blue berets leave , because then he becomes primarily responsible to the Bosnian policy of the UN and the allies . Clinton wants to have his cake and eat it too ... he wants to feel free to use American military power for the sake of domestic US politics and his domestic image , but he does n't want to assume the primary international leadership role in the UN and among the allies , like Bush , for all his faults , did in the Gulf War ... because with leadership comes responsibility , and Clinton seems to want to retain the Europeans as scapegoats .

From : KEVXU @ cunyvm.bitnet Subject : Re : Christianity and repeated lives Organization : City University of New York Lines : 36 While this is essentially a discussion of reincarnation in the context of Christianity Gerry Palo has made some comparisons to Asian religious beliefs on this topic which have simplified the Asian idea of karma to the point of misrepresentation . There are significant differences in the idea of karma among Hindus , Jains , Buddhists ( and even among the various Buddhist traditions . ) To refer to karma as a system of reward for past deeds is totally incorrect in the Buddhist and Jain traditions . Karma is considered to be a moral process in which intentions ( either good or evil ) shape a person 's predilections for future intention and action and produce a person who is more prone to good than evil , or the opposite -- '' reward '' has nothing to do with it . Both Jainism and Buddhism are atheistic so there is no deity to dispense rewards or punishments . Karma is usually described in terms of seeds and reaping the fruit thereof . In fact `` As you sow , so shall you reap '' is found in the Pali Canon as I recall , the metaphor of natural growth is explicit . Hinduism , or some sects in that tradition , are I believe much more deterministic and involve concepts closer to reward and punishment being theistically inclined . In point of fact , the Theravadin Buddhist tradition of Southeast Asia considers karma as only one of five influences in human life , and in fact from their point of view they would be unable to explain the mechanics of karma without the element of free will . Also in Eastern religions there is a difference between reincarnation and rebirth , which is essentially absent in Western considerations . Is n't Origen usually cited as the most prestigious proponent of reincarnation among Christian thinkers ? What were his views , and how did he relate them to the Christian scriptures ? Jack Carroll

Rich , First of all you might want to join the VetteNet ( vettes @ chiller.compaq .com ) during your search/acquisition of the 67 . $ 20k sounds about right for a wrong engine , condition 3 car . This means that the car may not have significant investment value but could be an excellent driver and or hobby car . You will also want to get a copy of the Corvette Black Book immediately . Do n't leave home ( to look at Vettes ) without it . Since you are contemplating spending > $ 20k , you might want to invest a few hours in reading the `` Corvette Buyer 's Guide '' and purchase Noland Adams ' tape `` How to Buy a Corvette . '' The tape shows you how to check for damage , etc.. There are many many factors that will affect the value , road worthiness , and repair expense of your proposed 67 . The list is much too long to go into here . Join the VetteNet where there are over 100 current Corvette owners ( many with 60s vintage vettes ) that are available to help you . The pubs I mentioned above are available from Mid-America Designs ( 800 ) 637-5533 and several other Corvette parts sources . Good luck ! ! ! Tom ( '68 327/350hp - '79 Cruiser )

JPEG ( pronounced `` jay-peg '' ) is a standardized image compression mechanism . JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group , the original name of the committee that wrote the standard . JPEG is designed for compressing either full-color or gray-scale digital images of `` natural '' , real-world scenes . It does not work so well on non-realistic images , such as cartoons or line drawings . JPEG does not handle black-and-white ( 1-bit-per-pixel ) images , nor does it handle motion picture compression . Standards for compressing those types of images are being worked on by other committees , named JBIG and MPEG respectively . JPEG is `` lossy '' , meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't quite identical to what you originally put in . The algorithm achieves much of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye , notably the fact that small color details are n't perceived as well as small details of light-and-dark . Thus , JPEG is intended for compressing images that will be looked at by humans . If you plan to machine-analyze your images , the small errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you , even if they are invisible to the eye . A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjusting compression parameters . This means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality . You can make *extremely* small files if you do n't mind poor quality ; this is useful for indexing image archives , making thumbnail views or icons , etc . etc . Conversely , if you are n't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting , you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied , and accept lesser compression . [ 2 ] Why use JPEG ? There are two good reasons : to make your image files smaller , and to store 24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data . Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images . Being able to compress a 2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time ! ( If you are comparing GIF and JPEG , the size ratio is more like four to one . More details below . ) If your viewing software does n't support JPEG directly , you 'll have to convert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images . Even with a JPEG-capable viewer , it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image than to view an image of a simpler format ( GIF , for instance ) . Thus , using JPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff : you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply . It 's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved , the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file . I 'll let you do the arithmetic yourself . The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet posting format is that JPEG can store full color information : 24 bits/pixel ( 16 million colors ) instead of 8 or less ( 256 or fewer colors ) . If you have only 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you . Within a couple of years , though , 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as black-and-white MacPaint format does today . Furthermore , for reasons detailed in section 7 , JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware . Hence JPEG is considerably more appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard . [ 3 ] When should I use JPEG , and when should I stick with GIF ? JPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely ; for some types of images , GIF is superior in image quality , file size , or both . One of the first things to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to . As a rule of thumb , JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or gray-scale images of `` realistic '' scenes ; that means scanned photographs and similar material . JPEG is superior even if you do n't have 24-bit display hardware , and it is a LOT superior if you do . ( See section 7 for details . ) GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors , such as cartoons and line drawings . In particular , large areas of pixels that are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by GIF . JPEG ca n't squeeze these files as much as GIF does without introducing visible defects . This sort of image is best kept in GIF form . ( In particular , single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files , but they should be avoided in JPEG files . ) JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges : a row of pure-black pixels adjacent to a row of pure-white pixels , for example . Sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting . Again , this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs , but it shows up fairly often in GIF files : borders , overlaid text , etc . The blurriness is particularly objectionable with text that 's only a few pixels high . If you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text , do n't JPEG it . Computer-drawn images ( ray-traced scenes , for instance ) usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity . The more complex and subtly rendered the image , the more likely that JPEG will do well on it . The same goes for semi-realistic artwork ( fantasy drawings and such ) . Plain black-and-white ( two level ) images should never be converted to JPEG . You need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale images . It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images of up to 256 levels , while JPEG is not . If you have an existing library of GIF images , you may wonder whether you should convert them to JPEG . You will lose a little image quality if you do . ( Section 7 , which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF , only applies if both formats start from a full-color original . If you start from a GIF , you 've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information ; JPEG can only make things worse . ) However , the disk space savings may justify converting anyway . This is a decision you 'll have to make for yourself . If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG , see section 14 for hints . Be prepared to leave some images in GIF format , since some GIFs will not convert well . [ 4 ] How well does JPEG compress images ? Pretty darn well . Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have handy , a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor . The first three files are for comparison purposes ; the rest were created with the free JPEG software described in section 6B . File Size in bytes Comments ship.ppm 1145040 Original file in PPM format ( no compression ; 24 bits or 3 bytes per pixel , plus a few bytes overhead ) ship.ppm.Z 963829 PPM file passed through Unix compress compress does n't accomplish a lot , you 'll note . Other text-oriented compressors give similar results . ship.gif 240438 Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif Most of the savings is the result of losing color info : GIF saves 8 bits/pixel , not 24 . ( See sec . 7 . ) ship.jpg95 155622 cjpeg -Q 95 ( highest useful quality setting ) This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original , at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs . ship.jpg75 58009 cjpeg -Q 75 ( default setting ) You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this from the original , even with both on-screen at once . ship.jpg50 38406 cjpeg -Q 50 This has slight defects ; if you know what to look for , you could tell it 's been JPEGed without seeing the original . Still as good image quality as many recent postings in Usenet pictures groups . ship.jpg25 25192 cjpeg -Q 25 JPEG 's characteristic `` blockiness '' becomes apparent at this setting ( djpeg -blocksmooth helps some ) . Still , I 've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were of poorer image quality than this . ship.jpg5o 6587 cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize ( -optimize cuts table overhead ) Blocky , but perfectly satisfactory for preview or indexing purposes . Note that this file is TINY : the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 ! In this case JPEG can make a file that 's a factor of four or five smaller than a GIF of comparable quality ( the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the GIF , better if you have a full-color display ) . This seems to be a typical ratio for real-world scenes . [ 5 ] What are good `` quality '' settings for JPEG ? Most JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting . There seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings . `` Quality 95 '' does NOT mean `` keep 95 % of the information '' , as some have claimed . The quality scale is purely arbitrary ; it 's not a percentage of anything . The name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting ( smallest file size ) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original . This setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another , but here are some rules of thumb . The default quality setting ( -Q 75 ) is very often the best choice . This setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image . Try -Q 75 first ; if you see defects , then go up . Except for experimental purposes , never go above -Q 95 ; saying -Q 100 will produce a file two or three times as large as -Q 95 , but of hardly any better quality . If the image was less than perfect quality to begin with , you might be able to go down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation . On the other hand , you might need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation . The second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG . The default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images , but -Q 85 to 95 is usually better for converting GIFs ( see section 14 for more info ) . If you want a very small file ( say for preview or indexing purposes ) and are prepared to tolerate large defects , a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is about right . -Q 2 or so may be amusing as `` op art '' . ( Note : the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG software described in section 6B , and to many programs based on it . Other JPEG implementations , such as Image Alchemy , may use a completely different quality scale . Some programs do n't even provide a numeric scale , just '' high '' / '' medium '' / '' low '' -style choices . ) [ 6 ] Where can I get JPEG software ? Most of the programs described in this section are available by FTP . If you do n't know how to use FTP , see the FAQ article `` How to find sources '' . ( If you do n't have direct access to FTP , read about ftpmail servers in the same article . ) That article appears regularly in news.answers , or you can get it by sending e-mail to mail-server @ rtfm.mit.edu with '' send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources '' in the body . The `` Anonymous FTP List FAQ '' may also be helpful -- - it 's usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in the news.answers archive . NOTE : this list changes constantly . If you have a copy more than a couple months old , get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive . [ 6A ] If you are looking for `` canned '' software , viewers , etc : The first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one kind of system . If you do n't see what you want for your machine , check out the portable JPEG software described at the end of the list . Note that this list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over Internet ; but some commercial programs are listed too . X Windows : XV ( shareware , $ 25 ) is an excellent viewer for JPEG , GIF , and many other image formats . It can also do format conversion and some simple image manipulations . It 's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu ( 18.24.0.12 ) , file contrib/xv-3.00.tar.Z . Version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support for 24-bit displays and many other improvements ; however , it is brand new and still has some bugs lurking . If you prefer not to be on the bleeding edge , stick with version 2.21 , also available from export . Note that version 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display ( you 'll get only 8-bit color ) , nor for converting 24-bit images to JPEG . But 2.21 works fine for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG . CAUTION : there is a glitch in version 2.21 : be sure to check the `` save at normal size '' checkbox when saving a JPEG file , or the file will be blurry . Another good choice for X Windows is John Cristy 's free ImageMagick package , also available from export.lcs.mit.edu , file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z . This package handles many image processing and conversion tasks . The ImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly ; for colormapped displays , it does better ( though slower ) color quantization than XV or the basic free JPEG software . Both of the above are large , complex packages . If you just want a simple image viewer , try xloadimage or xli . xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest release , 3.03. xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu , file contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.Z . xli is a variant version of xloadimage , said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original . ( The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage , at least with respect to JPEG files , because it has the IJG v4 decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1 . The next xloadimage release will fix this . ) xli is also free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu , file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z . Both programs are said to do the right thing with 24-bit displays . MS-DOS : This covers plain DOS ; for Windows or OS/2 programs , see the next headings . One good choice is Eric Praetzel 's free DVPEG , which views JPEG and GIF files . The current version , 2.5 , is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca ( 129.97.50.50 ) , file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip . This is a good basic viewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines . The user interface is not flashy , but it 's functional . Another freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei 's Hiview . The current version , 1.2 , is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites ( see NOTE below ) , file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip . Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU and a VCPI-compatible memory manager ( QEMM386 and 386MAX work ; Windows and OS/2 do not ) . Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no bigger than your screen . For larger images , it scales the image down to fit on the screen ( rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do ) . You may or may not prefer this approach , but there 's no denying that it slows down loading of large images considerably . Note : installation is a bit tricky ; read the directions carefully ! A shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ( $ 30 ) . This is easier to install than either of the two freeware alternatives . Its user interface is also much spiffier-looking , although personally I find it harder to use -- - more keystrokes , inconsistent behavior . It is faster than DVPEG but a little slower than Hiview , at least on my hardware . ( For images larger than screen size , DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed , and both are faster than Hiview . ) The current version is 2.1 , available from Simtel20 and mirror sites ( see NOTE below ) , file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip . Requires a VESA graphics driver ; if you do n't have one , look in vesadrv2.zip or vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory . ( Many recent PCs have a built-in VESA driver , so do n't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains that the driver is missing . ) A second shareware alternative is Fullview , which has been kicking around the net for a while , but I do n't know any stable archive location for it . The current ( rather old ) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway . The author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly and it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time . The well-known GIF viewer CompuShow ( CSHOW ) supports JPEG in its latest revision , 8.60a . However , CSHOW 's JPEG implementation is n't very good : it 's slow ( about half the speed of the above viewers ) and image quality is poor except on hi-color displays . Too bad ... it 'd have been nice to see a good JPEG capability in CSHOW . Shareware , $ 25 . Available from Simtel20 and mirror sites ( see NOTE below ) , file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip . Due to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware , any one of these viewers might not work on your particular machine . If you ca n't get *any* of them to work , you 'll need to use one of the following conversion programs to convert JPEG to GIF , then view with your favorite GIF viewer . ( If you have hi-color hardware , do n't use GIF as the intermediate format ; try to find a TARGA-capable viewer instead . VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right thing with hi-color displays . ) The Independent JPEG Group 's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20 and mirror sites ( see NOTE below ) , file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip ( or jpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory ) . These files are DOS compilations of the free source code described in section 6B ; they will convert JPEG to and from GIF , Targa , and PPM formats . Handmade Software offers free JPEG < = > GIF conversion tools , GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF . These are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format ; in particular , you ca n't get 24-bit color output from a JPEG . The major advantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI 's proprietary JPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format . Since HSI-format files are rather widespread on BBSes , this is a useful capability . Version 2.0 of these tools is free ( prior versions were shareware ) . Get it from Simtel20 and mirror sites ( see NOTE below ) , file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip . NOTE : do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet , since it is not readable on non-PC platforms . Handmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation package , Image Alchemy . This will translate JPEG files ( both JFIF and HSI formats ) to and from many other image formats . It can also display images . A demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites ( see NOTE below ) , file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip . NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20 : The Internet 's key archive site for PC-related programs is Simtel20 , full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil ( 192.88.110.20 ) . Simtel20 runs a non-Unix system with weird directory names ; where this document refers to directory ( eg ) `` msdos/graphics '' at Simtel20 , that really means '' pd1 : < msdos.graphics > '' . If you are not physically on MILnet , you should expect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20 . There are several Internet sites that maintain copies ( mirrors ) of the Simtel20 archives ; most FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead . A popular USA mirror site is oak.oakland.edu ( 141.210.10.117 ) , which keeps Simtel20 files in ( eg ) `` /pub/msdos/graphics '' . If you have no FTP capability , you can retrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail ; see informational postings in comp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how . If you are outside the USA , consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is . Microsoft Windows : There are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images . ( Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware , due to Windows ' system overhead . Note that you can run the DOS conversion programs described above inside a Windows DOS window . ) The newest entry is WinECJ , which is free and EXTREMELY fast . Version 1.0 is available from ftp.rahul.net , file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip . Requires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode . This is a no-frills viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it decodes ; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers . But it 's so fast you 'll use it anyway , at least for previewing ... JView is freeware , fairly fast , has good on-line help , and can write out the decompressed image in Windows BMP format ; but it ca n't create new JPEG files , and it does n't view GIFs . JView also lacks some other useful features of the shareware viewers ( such as brightness adjustment ) , but it's an excellent basic viewer . The current version , 0.9 , is available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu ( 129.79.20.84 ) , file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip . ( Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites , including wuarchive.wustl.edu . ) WinJPEG ( shareware , $ 20 ) displays JPEG , GIF , Targa , TIFF , and BMP image files ; it can write all of these formats too , so it can be used as a converter . It has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and slideshow . The current version is 2.1 , available from Simtel20 and mirror sites ( see NOTE above ) , file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip . ( This is a slow 286-compatible version ; if you register , you 'll get the 386-only version , which is roughly 25 % faster . ) ColorView is another shareware entry ( $ 30 ) . This was an early and promising contender , but it has not been updated in some time , and at this point it has no real advantages over WinJPEG . If you want to try it anyway , the current version is 0.97 , available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu , file pub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip . ( I understand that a new version will be appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS . ) DVPEG ( see DOS heading ) also works under Windows , but only in full-screen mode , not in a window . OS/2 : The following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu ( 128.123.35.151 ) . Note : check /pub/uploads for more recent versions -- - the hobbes moderator is not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories . /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip 32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs , version 4 . /pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip 16-bit version of same , for OS/2 1.x . /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc12.zip Image Archiver 1.02 : image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface . Strong on conversion functions , viewing is a bit weaker . Shareware , $ 15 . /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip PMJPEG 1.1 : OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG , a popular viewer for Windows ( see description in Windows section ) . Shareware , $ 20 . /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview85.zip PMView 0.85 : JPEG/GIF/BMP viewer . GIF viewing very fast , JPEG viewing fast if you have huge amounts of RAM , otherwise about the same speed as the above programs . Strong 24-bit display support . Shareware , $ 20 . Macintosh : Most Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple 's JPEG implementation , which is part of the QuickTime system extension ; so you need to have QuickTime installed . To use QuickTime , you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running System 6.0.7 or later . ( If you 're running System 6 , you must also install the 32-bit QuickDraw extension ; this is built-in on System 7 . ) You can get QuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com , file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx . ( As of 11/92 , this file contains QuickTime 1.5 , which is better than QT 1.0 in several ways . With respect to JPEG , it is marginally faster and considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file . However , some applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5 . ) Mac users should keep in mind that QuickTime 's JPEG format , PICT/JPEG , is not the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format . ( See section 10 for details . ) If you post images on Usenet , make sure they are in JFIF format . Most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format . The first choice is probably JPEGView , a free program for viewing images that are in JFIF format , PICT/JPEG format , or GIF format . It also can convert between the two JPEG formats . The current version , 2.0 , is a big improvement over prior versions . Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu ( 36.44.0.6 ) , file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx . Requires System 7 and QuickTime . On 8-bit displays , JPEGView usually produces the best color image quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers . JPEGView can view large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers ; in fact , it's the only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a typical 4MB Mac . Given a large image , JPEGView automatically scales it down to fit on the screen , rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers . ( You can zoom in on any desired portion , though . ) Some people like this behavior , some do n't . Overall , JPEGView 's user interface is very well thought out . GIFConverter , a shareware ( $ 40 ) image viewer/converter , supports JFIF and PICT/JPEG , as well as GIF and several other image formats . The latest version is 2.3.2 . Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu , file /info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx . Requires System 6.0.5 or later . GIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer , but it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capabilities , so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of playing around with images . Also , the newest version of GIFConverter can load and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime , so it is your best bet if your machine is too old to run QuickTime . ( But it 's faster with QuickTime . ) Note : If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG , try converting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert , then viewing the GIF version . JPEG Convert , a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities , is available from sumex-aim.stanford.edu , file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx . This will run on any Mac , but it only does file conversion , not viewing . You can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer . Previous versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6 , a JPEG < = > GIF converter based on an old version of the IJG code . If you are using this program , you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert . Apple 's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF , QuickTime JPEG , and GIF format , and can convert between these formats . You can get PictPixie from ftp.apple.com , file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx . Requires QuickTime . PictPixie was intended as a developer 's tool , and it's really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime . Some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory , it produces relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display , and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface . Worse , PictPixie is an unsupported program , meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not intend to fix . ( There is an old version of PictPixie , called PICTCompressor , floating around the net . If you have this you should trash it , as it 's even buggier . Also , the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much cleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor . Note that Picture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net . ) Storm Technology 's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter . This rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways , but it will run without System 7 or QuickTime , so you may be forced to use it on older systems . ( It does need 32-bit QuickDraw , so really old machines can't use it . ) You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu , file /info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx . You must set the file type of a downloaded image file to 'JPEG ' to allow Picture Decompress to open it . If your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw ( a Mac Plus for instance ) , GIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing . If you do n't want to pay for GIFConverter , use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer . More and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG , although not all can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format . Adobe Photoshop , version 2.0.1 or later , can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files ( use the JPEG plug-in from the Acquire menu ) . You must set the file type of a downloaded JPEG file to 'JPEG ' to allow Photoshop to recognize it . Amiga : ( Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at amiga.physik.unizh.ch ( 130.60.80.80 ) . There are many mirror sites of this archive and you should try to use the closest one . In the USA , a good choice is wuarchive.wustl.edu ; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/ ... ) HamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter , as well as being a general image manipulation tool . It 's cheap ( shareware , $ 20 ) and can read several formats besides JPEG . The current version is 2.0.8 . A demo version is available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch ( and mirror sites ) , file amiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha . The demo version will crop images larger than 512x512 , but it is otherwise fully functional . Rend24 ( shareware , $ 30 ) is an image renderer that can display JPEG , ILBM , and GIF images . The program can be used to create animations , even capturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave . The current version is 1.05 , available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch ( and mirror sites ) , file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha . ( Note : although this directory is supposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs , the program will also run under AmigaDOS 1.3 , 2.04 or 2.1 . ) Viewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer . The current version is 1.04 , available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch ( and mirror sites ) , file amiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha . If you 're willing to spend real money , there are several commercial packages that support JPEG . Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel , the author of Rend24 and Viewtek . These are CineMorph , a standalone image morphing package , and ImageFX , an impressive 24-bit image capture , conversion , editing , painting , effects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph . Both are distributed by Great Valley Products . Art Department Professional ( ADPro ) , from ASDG Inc , is the most widely used commercial image manipulation software for Amigas . ImageMaster , from Black Belt Systems , is another well-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support . The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from amiga.physik.unizh.ch ( and mirror sites ) in directory amiga/gfx/conv , file AmigaJPEGV4.lha . These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM , GIF , Targa formats . The Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs , many based on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software ( thanks to a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month , without so much as notifying the authors ) . Among these are `` AugJPEG '' , `` NewAmyJPEG '' , '' VJPEG '' , and probably others I have not even heard of . In my opinion , anything older than IJG version 3 ( March 1992 ) is not worth the disk space it 's stored on ; if you have such a program , trash it and get something newer . Atari ST : The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST , TT , etc , from atari.archive.umich.edu , file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo . These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM , GIF , Targa formats . For monochrome ST monitors , try MGIF , which manages to achieve four-level grayscale effect by flickering . Version 4.1 reads JPEG files . Available from atari.archive.umich.edu , file /atari/Graphics/mgif41b.zoo . I have not heard of any other free or shareware JPEG-capable viewers for Ataris , but surely there must be some by now ? Pointers appreciated . Acorn Archimedes : ! ChangeFSI , supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10 , can convert from and view JPEG JFIF format . Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG , although this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking . Recent versions ( since 7.11 ) of the shareware program Translator can handle JPEG , along with about 30 other image formats . While older versions can be found on some Archimedes bboards , the current version is only available by registering with the author , John Kortink , Nutterbrink 31 , 7544 WJ , Enschede , The Netherlands . Price 35 Dutch guilders ( about $ 22 or 10 pounds ) . There 's also a commercial product called ! JPEG which provides JPEG read/write functionality and direct JPEG viewing , as well as a host of other image format conversion and processing options . This is more expensive but not necessarily better than the above programs . Contact : DT Software , FREEPOST , Cambridge , UK . Tel : 0223 841099 . Portable software for almost any system : If none of the above fits your situation , you can obtain and compile the free JPEG conversion software described in 6B . You 'll also need a viewer program . If your display is 8 bits or less , any GIF viewer will do fine ; if you have a display with more color capability , try to find a viewer that can read Targa or PPM 24-bit image files . There are numerous commercial JPEG offerings , with more popping up every day . I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find the available free or shareware software vastly too slow . In that case , purchase a hardware-assisted product . Ask pointed questions about whether the product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can handle the JFIF file format ; many of the earliest commercial releases are not and never will be compatible with anyone else 's files . [ 6B ] If you are looking for source code to work with : Free , portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent JPEG Group , which I lead . A package containing our source code , documentation , and some small test files is available from several places . The `` official '' archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net ( 137.39.1.9 or 192.48.96.9 ) . Look under directory /graphics/jpeg ; the current release is jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z . ( This is a compressed TAR file ; do n't forget to retrieve in binary mode . ) You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP . If you are on a PC and do n't know how to cope with .tar.Z format , you may prefer ZIP format , which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites ( see NOTE above ) , file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip . This file will also be available on CompuServe , in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum ( GO PICS ) , library 15 , as jpsrc4.zip . If you have no FTP access , you can retrieve the source from your nearest comp.sources.misc archive ; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34 . ( If you do n't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings , see the FAQ article `` How to find sources '' , referred to at the top of section 6 . ) The free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG `` JFIF '' format and image files in GIF , PBMPLUS PPM/PGM , Utah RLE , and Truevision Targa file formats . The core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other programs , such as image viewers . The package is highly portable ; we have tested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays . We have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use . Companies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products . We do not ask a royalty , although we do ask for an acknowledgement in product literature ( see the README file in the distribution for details ) . We hope to make this software industrial-quality -- - although , as with anything that 's free , we offer no warranty and accept no liability . The Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization ; if you 'd like to contribute to improving our software , you are welcome to join . [ 7 ] What 's all this hoopla about color quantization ? Most people do n't have full-color ( 24 bit per pixel ) display hardware . Typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel , so it can display 256 or fewer distinct colors at a time . To display a full-color image , the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors . This process is called `` color quantization '' . ( This is something of a misnomer , `` color selection '' would be a better term . We 're stuck with the standard usage though . ) Clearly , color quantization is a lossy process . It turns out that for most images , the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG ( except at the very lowest JPEG quality settings ) . Since JPEG is a full-color format , converting a color JPEG image for display on 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization . This is true for *all* color JPEGs : even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG , what comes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors , but thousands of colors . This happens because JPEG 's lossiness affects each pixel a little differently , so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors . Each original color gets `` smeared '' into a group of nearby colors . Therefore quantization is always required to display a color JPEG on a colormapped display , regardless of the image source . The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output . ( Incidentally , because of this effect it 's nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a JPEG image . Even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values , different JPEG decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences . I occasionally see posted images described as `` 256-color JPEG '' . This tells me that the poster ( a ) has n't read this FAQ and ( b ) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF . JPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale ( just like photographs ) , but number of colors just is n't a useful concept for JPEG . ) On the other hand , a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to 256 or fewer colors . ( A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its palette , and the format does n't allow more than 256 palette entries . ) For purposes of Usenet picture distribution , GIF has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization , so recipients do n't have to . This is also the *disadvantage* of GIF : you 're stuck with the sender's quantization . If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display , you have to re-quantize , resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image . Furthermore , if the sender did n't use a high-quality color quantization algorithm , you 're out of luck . For this reason , JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines do n't match the sender 's display hardware . JPEG 's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user 's display hardware . Furthermore , you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms ( there is a lot of active research in this area ) , or purchase better display hardware , to get a better view of JPEG images you already have . With a GIF , you 're stuck forevermore with what was sent . It 's also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines . If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA display , for example , you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to . This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations ( one to create the GIF , one to display it ) , but often it's also due to sloppiness . JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all , and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed . Thus , JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average GIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones ! Finally , an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display hardware already : 15-bit `` hi-color '' PC displays , true 24-bit displays on workstations and Macintoshes , etc . For these people , GIF is already obsolete , as it can not represent an image to the full capabilities of their display . JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively . Thus , JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images in a machine-independent fashion . [ 8 ] How does JPEG work ? The buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling , discrete cosine transforms , coefficient quantization , and Huffman or arithmetic entropy coding . This article 's long enough already , so I 'm not going to say more than that here . For technical information , see the comp.compression FAQ . This is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu , in files /pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part [ 1-3 ] . If you need help in using the news.answers archive , see the top of this article . [ 9 ] What about lossless JPEG ? There 's a great deal of confusion on this subject . The JPEG committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm , i.e. , one that guarantees the final output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input . However , this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular , lossy JPEG algorithm , and it offers much less compression . At present , very few implementations of lossless JPEG exist , and all of them are commercial . Saying `` -Q 100 '' to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image . What it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step . There is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step . ( With the V4 free JPEG code , you can also say '' -sample 1x1 '' to turn off subsampling . Keep in mind that many commercial JPEG implementations can not cope with the resulting file . ) Even with both quantization and subsampling turned off , the regular JPEG algorithm is not lossless , because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations . The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value ; it 's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye , but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image . At this minimum-loss setting , regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image . True lossless JPEG provides roughly the same amount of compression , but it guarantees bit-for-bit accuracy . If you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than 6 bits per pixel ( per color component ) , you may want to look into the JBIG bilevel image compression standard . This performs better than JPEG lossless on such images . JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with 6 or more bits per pixel ; furthermore , JPEG is public domain ( at least with a Huffman back end ) , while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents . [ 10 ] Why all the argument about file formats ? Strictly speaking , JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms ; it does *not* refer to a specific image file format . The JPEG committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations . Since we ca n't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format , this leaves us with a problem . In the absence of official standards , a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to '' do their own thing '' , and as a result their programs are n't compatible with anybody else 's . The closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work that 's been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems . They have defined two JPEG-based file formats : * JFIF ( JPEG File Interchange Format ) , a `` low-end '' format that transports pixels and not much else . * TIFF/JPEG , aka TIFF 6.0 , an extension of the Aldus TIFF format . TIFF is a `` high-end '' format that will let you record just about everything you ever wanted to know about an image , and a lot more besides : - ) . TIFF is a lot more complex than JFIF , and may well prove less transportable , because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different and incompatible subsets of TIFF . It 's not likely that adding JPEG to the mix will do anything to improve this situation . Both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of JPEG-related products ; it 's reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards . I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in picture postings . JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now ; the TIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted , and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details . Even when TIFF/JPEG is well defined , the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported `` lowest common denominator '' ; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable . A particular case that people may be interested in is Apple 's QuickTime software for the Macintosh . QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped inside the Mac-specific PICT structure . Conversion between JFIF and QuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward , and several Mac programs are available to do it ( see Mac portion of section 6A ) . If you have an editor that handles binary files , you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF by hand ; see section 11 for details . Another particular case is Handmade Software 's programs ( GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and Image Alchemy ) . These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF format . By default , though , they write a proprietary format developed by HSI . This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be used for Usenet postings . Use the -j switch to get JFIF output . ( This applies to old versions of these programs ; the current releases emit JFIF format by default . You still should be careful not to post HSI-format files , unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms . ) [ 11 ] How do I recognize which file format I have , and what do I do about it ? If you have an alleged JPEG file that your software wo n't read , it 's likely to be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format . You can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file : 1 . A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters ( hex ) FF D8 FF E0 , followed by two variable bytes ( often hex 00 10 ) , followed by 'JFIF ' . 2 . If you see FF D8 at the start , but not the rest of it , you may have a `` raw JPEG '' file . This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software -- - it 's worth a try , anyway . 3 . HSI files start with 'hsi1 ' . You 're out of luck unless you have HSI software . Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data , but they wo n't decompress properly with non-HSI programs . 4 . A Macintosh PICT file , if JPEG-compressed , will have a couple hundred bytes of header followed by a JFIF header ( scan for 'JFIF ' ) . Strip off everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it . 5 . Anything else : it 's a proprietary format , or not JPEG at all . If you are lucky , the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream . If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream ( look for FF D8 ) , try stripping off everything before that . In uuencoded Usenet postings , the characteristic JFIF pattern is '' begin '' line M_ ] C_X ... whereas uuencoded HSI files will start with '' begin '' line M : '-I ... If you learn to check for the former , you can save yourself the trouble of downloading non-JFIF files . [ 12 ] What about arithmetic coding ? The JPEG spec defines two different `` back end '' modules for the final output of compressed data : either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed . The choice has no impact on image quality , but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file . On typical images , arithmetic coding produces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding . ( All the file-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding . ) Unfortunately , the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the JPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM , AT & T , and Mitsubishi . Thus *you can not legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses from these companies . ( The `` fair use '' doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm , but actually storing any images with it is dubious at best . ) At least in the short run , I recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding ; the space savings is n't great enough to justify the potential legal hassles . In particular , arithmetic coding *should not* be used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet . There is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future . Stay tuned for further details . [ 13 ] Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression ? It would be nice if , having compressed an image with JPEG , you could decompress it , manipulate it ( crop off a border , say ) , and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially . Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE . In general , recompressing an altered image loses more information , though usually not as much as was lost the first time around . The next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it *without changing it* then there is no further loss , i.e. , you get an identical JPEG file . Even this is not true ; at least , not with the current free JPEG software . It 's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error . If you repeatedly compress and decompress , the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation output . ( It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change . ) One of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited , but I am not optimistic about it . In any case , the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg , at the original quality setting , would introduce no further loss . Even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation . ( If you 're wondering why , it 's because the pixel-block boundaries move . If you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels , you might be safe , but that 's a mighty limited capability ! ) The bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images , but you do n't want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps . Use a lossless format ( PPM , RLE , TIFF , etc ) while working on the image , then JPEG it when you are ready to file it away . Aside from avoiding degradation , you will save a lot of compression/decompression time this way : - ) . [ 14 ] What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG ? As stated earlier , you *will* lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing GIF image to JPEG . If you can obtain the original full-color data the GIF was made from , it 's far better to make a JPEG from that . But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from , here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality . The first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG , to make sure you are happy with it , before throwing away the corresponding GIF ; that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary . Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs , as explained in section 3 ; in particular , cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors do n't convert well . You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality will be *larger* than the GIF . ( So check the sizes too . ) Experience to date suggests that large , high-visual-quality GIFs are the best candidates for conversion to JPEG . They chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings , and they convert to JPEG with least degradation . Do n't waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes . Also , don't expect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created directly from full-color originals . To maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through JPEG files would be ( i.e. , shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file , not 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons ) . Many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color border around a GIF image . While useless , this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in GIF files . It is NOT free in JPEG files , and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts ( `` ghost '' edges ) . Do yourself a favor and crop off any border before JPEGing . ( If you are on an X Windows system , XV 's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this . ) cjpeg 's default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input , but for GIF inputs , Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation . ( If you apply smoothing as suggested below , the higher Q setting may not be necessary . ) Color GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually `` dithered '' to fool your eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store . If you enlarge the image , you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors ; at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value . The trouble with dithering is that , to JPEG , it looks like high-spatial-frequency color noise ; and JPEG ca n't compress noise very well . The resulting JPEG file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from JPEGing the original full color image ( if you had it ) . To get around this , you want to `` smooth '' the GIF image before compression . Smoothing averages together nearby pixels , thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway , and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give JPEG trouble . Appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high Q factor , thus further reducing the size of the compressed file , while still obtaining a better-looking output image than you 'd get without smoothing . With the V4 free JPEG software ( or products based on it ) , a simple smoothing capability is built in . Try `` -smooth 10 '' or so when converting GIFs . Values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs . Heavy-handed dithering may require larger smoothing factors . ( If you can see regular fine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement , then strong smoothing is definitely called for . ) Too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image , which you do n't want . If you are an image processing wizard , you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program , such as pnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package . However , cjpeg 's built-in smoother is a LOT faster than pnmconvol ... The upshot of all this is that `` cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10 '' is probably a good starting point for converting GIFs . But if you really care about the image , you 'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - For more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in particular , contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info @ uunet.uu.net . -- tom lane organizer , Independent JPEG Group Internet : tgl @ cs.cmu.edu BITNET : tgl % cs.cmu.edu @ carnegie
From : nagle @ netcom.com ( John Nagle ) Subject : Re : Key Registering Bodies Organization : NETCOM On-line Communication Services ( 408 241-9760 guest ) Lines : 29 Since the law requires that wiretaps be requested by the Executive Branch and approved by the Judicial Branch , it seems clear that one of the key registering bodies should be under the control of the Judicial Branch . I suggest the Supreme Court , or , regionally , the Courts of Appeal . More specifically , the offices of their Clerks . Courts already operate substantial record-keeping operations . Some of these records are confidential . So the concept of a court holding information in confidence in accordance with law has longstanding legal precedents . The judiciary is more immune to pressure from the executive branch than any executive branch agency or contractor can be . So judicial control of keys is appropriate . For the other half of the key , I suggest a unit of Congress , the General Accounting Office . The GAO is Congress 's staff unit for keeping tabs on the Executive Branch , and has an excellent reputation . It's controlled strictly by Congress ; the Executive Branch has no authority over it . With keys split between the Legislative and Judicial branches , we might have a chance of this system working honestly . If , of course , a way can be found to keep the keys from being siphoned off before they reach the repositories . This should not be construed as an endorsement by me of the whole Clipper concept . But if we have to have it , splitting control across all three branches of government might make it work . John Nagle

I say those who are not saved are not saved on account of their own sins . It is not because God did not give them sufficient grace , for He does do so , in His desire that all men might be saved . However , as only some are saved - and those who are saved are saved by the grace of God , `` not by works , lest any man should boast '' - the others are damned because of their obstinacy in refusing to heed the call of God . They are damned by their own free will and chosing , a choice forseen by God in His causing them to be not predestined , but reprobated instead . > so God uses grace like margarine : he only spreads it where it 's needed > and not where it is n't ? and so there are the saved and the not-saved , > and nothing in between . hmmmm . Certainly God does not distribute grace evenly . If He did , no one could have their heart hardened ( or rather , harden their heart , thus causing God to withdraw His grace ) . But , you are correct - the world is divided into those who God knows to be saved , and those God knows to be on the road to perdition . THe key is that God knows it and we do not . Thus , no one can boast in complete assurance that they are one of the elect and predestined . But no one who is a Christian in good standin should doubt their salvation either ( that shows a lack of trust in God ) . > be punished after we die . you 're saying what we get after we die has > a direct bearing on how we live now ? strange ... . You must admit it is possible . Anyway , why would you want something in the hear and know , when you can recieve 100 fold in heaven ? Better to lay up your treasure in heaven is what Jesus said . This is not to condemn the rich , but simply to point out that those who are rich are frequently very evil or immoral , so God must give them their blessing know , as they have chosen . Remeber , Jesus promised tribulation in this world , and hatred of others because we are Christians . He did not promise heaven on earth . He promised heaven . > so sin is either punished now or later -- and not both ? what if it's > sort of half-punished ? are there any grey areas in this doctrine ? Not really . Unless you do penance here on earth , you will have to do it in Purgatory , as Paul pointed out ( 1 Corinthians 3.15 ) . Those with poorer works , though still done with good intentions , will only be saved through fire ( the damned will of course go into fire immeadiately , for whatever good they did was not for God but for self ( dead works ) ) . Of course , the Church gives indulgences , has Confession , and Annointing of the Sick to remove sin and the the vestiges of sin , so there is really little excuse for ending up in Purgatory - it is a last hope for the somewhat lazy and careless as I said above in referring to Paul . And no comments were taken as flames . You are one of the more polite people I have talked to over the net . Andy Byler ps .

All the clamor over laetril resulted in the NCI spending quite a bit of money on clinical trials which proved ( to me anyway ) that laetril was ineffective against cancer . A physician who continued to use it , when better , more effective , treatments are available , may deserve to be called a quack . Anti-fungals are in a different class . The big question seems to be is it reasonable to use them in patients with GI distress or sinus problems that *could* be due to candida blooms following the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics ? Gorden Rubenfeld , through e-mail , has assured me that most physicians recognize the chance of candida blooms occuring after broad-spectrum antibiotic use and they therefore reinnoculate their patients with *good* bacteria to restore competetion for candida in the body . I do not believe that this is yet a standard part of medical practice . He deals with critical care patients where fungal infection ( systemic ) is a real problem and just because he tries to keep *good* bacteria in his patients does not mean that all physicians do this . I think that aspergillis is more likely to be found in the sinus mucus membranes than is candida . Women have been known for a very long time to suffer from candida blooms in the vagina and a women is lucky to find a physician who is willing to treat the cause and not give give her advise to use the OTC anti-fungal creams . Since candida colonizes primarily in the ano-rectal area , GI symptoms should be more common than vaginal problems after broad-spectrum antibiotic use . The problem we have here David is proof that GI discomfort can be caused by a candida bloom . The arguement is that without proof , no action is warrented . Medicine has not , and probalby never will be , practiced this way . There has always been the use of conventional wisdom . A very good example is kidney stones . Conventional wisdom ( because clinical trails have not been done to come up with an effective prevention ) , was that restricitng the intake of calcium and oxalates was the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming . Clinical trials focused on drugs or ultrasonic blasts to breakdown the stone once it formed . Through the recent New England J of Medicine article , we now know that conventional wisdom was wrong , increasing calcium intake is better at preventing stone formation than is restricting calcium intake . The conventional wisdom in animal husbandry has been that animals need to be reinnoculated with *good* bacteria after coming off antibiotic therapy . If it makes sense for livestock , why does n't it make sense for humans David ? We are not talking about a dangerous treatment ( unless you consider yogurt dangerous ) . If this were a standard part of medical practice , as Gordon R. says it is , then the incidence of GI distress and vaginal yeast infections should decline . Marty B .

BTW , Talking with the dealer I bought the car from got me nowhere . After being routed to a `` Firebird Specialist '' , I was able to confirm that this is in fact the case . At first , there was some problem with the 3:23 performance axle ratio . She would n't go into any details , so I do n't know if there were some shipped that had problems , or if production was held up because they simply did n't have the proper parts from the supplier . As I say , she was pretty vague on that , so if anyone else knows anything about this , feel free to respond . Supposedly , this problem is now solved . Second , there is a definate shortage of parts that is somehow related to the six-speed Manual transmission . So as of this posting , there is a production hold on these cars . She claimed part of the delay was not wanting to use inferior quality parts for the car , and therefore having to wait for the right high quality parts ... I 'm not positive that this applies to the Camaro as well , but I 'm guessing it would . Can anyone else shed some light on this ?

'' I am becoming increasingly convinced that most of us take Paul 's illustration about one body / many parts far too narrowly . It is easy to say that the one body represents a particular sect of Christianity ( generally our own ) , and the parts are clearly the various offices of ministry . There is a place for that . But having met people who are walking closeely with God in a wide variety of doctine - Catholic , Protestant , liberal , conservative , Orthodox , etc . - I am willing to encompass a wide spectrum of views within the context of the 'body of Christ . ' And I am equally sure that one day , after we shug off this mortal coil , when we no longer see through a glass darkly but see clearly , face to face , we will all be ashamed at some of the things we held as truth . We ought all fellowship , worship , and serve where we are called , and understand that where we are called may not be where everyone else is called . One of the fathers of the reformation ( help me out - ca n't recall the name ) put it quite succiently : In essentials , unity . In nonessentials , liberty . In all things , charity . While I agree with Lewis ( Mere Christianity ) that calling oneself a Christian implies some basic , fundamental standards of belief if the word is to mean anything at all , I think most of us define the bounds of essentials a bit too broadly , deny the place for liberty in questionable issues near those bounds , and ignore the requirements of charity all together . Me ? I attend a Vineyard church , speak in tongues , am effectively an inerrantist , though I 'll grant some inaccuracy in translation , am moderately pre-mill , and evangelical . But , I 'm not ready to damn those who use icons , say mass in latin , uphold the Virgin Mary ( though I really do n't believe that she was sinless ) , vote on Church membership , or insist on baptism for salvation . Of course , I think my doctine is pretty close to the truth - why would I follow it if I believed something else was closer to the truth ? But my understanding of the reality of a walk with Christ is continually evolving as I spend more and more time walking with Him , studying His word , and fellowshiping with others in the ( often extended ) family . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- I read , much of the night , and go south in the winter . -- T.S .

Not all kidney stones have calcium and not all calcium stones are calcium-oxalate . But the vast majority are calcium- oxalate . Calcium is just one piece of the puzzle . I cited that NEJM article as a way of pointing out to some of the physicians in this group that conventional wisdom is used in medicine , always has been and probably always will be . If one uses conventional wisdom , there is a chance that you will be wrong . As long as the error is not going to cause a lot of damage , what 's the big deal ( why call a physician who gives anti-fungals to sinus suffers or GI distress patients a quack ? ) . On the kidney stone problem . I 'd want a mineral profile run in a clinical chemistry lab . Balance is much more important than the dietary intake of calcium . I know that you use an electrical conductance technique to measure mineral balance in the body . I know that you do n't think that the serum levels for minerals are very useful ( I agree ) . If I can get a good nutritional assessment lab setup where I can actually measure the tissue reserve for minerals , I 'd like to do a collaborative study with you to see how your technique compares with mine .

No , I 'm not claiming 2,000,000 have been killed . We are in the middle of the genocide process that Mr. Major has given yet another `` green light '' to . Mladic seems to have most of what he wants , but Boban is just getting his appetite whetted . Because Mladic refuses to allow international observers to inspect mass-grave sites and killing centers in places like Foca , Brcko , and Visegrad , it will be years before we have an accurate account of the number killed . In practical terms , it would be impossible to kill all 2,000,000 . There just is n't the kind of machinery of crematoria and gas chambers and transportation lines that the Nazis took 8 YEARS to develop . And remember , the Nazis killed minorities in the countries they occupied . To actually kill 42 % of the population requires extreme genocidal organization . But I do claim that the goal of the genocide is the systematic annihilation of Bosnian Muslim culture , by killing as many as is feasible , by rape , by torture , by the demolition of mosques , libraries , and culture artificts , the burning and renaming of villages , the shelling of civilians . So that there wo n't be any of the 2,000,000 or so Muslims whose lives have not been shattered by the genocide , though they still may be alive . And Mr. Major not only finds this acceptable , he helps it along by making sure that the victims do n't have arms to defend themselves . > > -Nick > Mike . -- Michael Sells , Department of Religion , Haverford College Haverford , Pa 19041-1392

Sperm deposited near the entrance of the vagina has been known to cause pregnancy , even in the presence of a hymen . I doubt that sperm could make it through a layer of cloth then find the right path to a waiting ovum , but it might be possible . So , it is possible for a woman to be both virgin and pregnant . Also , some hymens are sufficiently loose to allow near-normal intercourse without rupturing .

Very glad you asked , since I goofed -- it should be Philippian 1:14-19 : ( here from NIV ) Because of my chains , most of the brothers in the Lord have been encouraged to speak the word of God more courageously and fearlessly . It is true that some preach Christ out of envy and rivalry , but others out of good will . The latter do so in love , knowing that I am put here for the gospel . The former preach Christ out of selfish ambition , not sincerely , supposing that they can stir up trouble for me while I am chains . But what does it matter ? The important thing is that in every way , whether from false motives or true , Christ is preached . And because of this I rejoice . My comment stems from the realization that we who love the Lord , are human and imperfect . Whatever we `` preach , '' no matter how eloquent , or how corrupted -- is of little difference . Those who know the Master's voice will recognize Him -- a gem-stone amidst rock . Such is also the lesson of the `` stumblingblock . '' For those who have an ear to hear . | -- J -- | | stephen

From : mlf3 @ ns1.cc.lehigh.edu ( Matt Fante ) Subject : [ COMMENT ] Clinton/Reno/BATF and Waco Organization : Lehigh University Lines : 115 \input amstex \documentstyle { amsppt } \pagewidth { 6.5in } \magnification=1200 \pageheight { 7.5in } \ \title { Letter to the Editor } \endtitle \author { Matthew L. Fante } \endauthor \date { April 20 , 1993 } \enddate \endtopmatter In a letter to the FBI , David Koresh said : `` Do you want me to pull back the heavens and show you my anger ? ! ... fear me . '' The 51 day standoff between federal agents and the Branch Davidians ended on April 19 in what appeared to be a mass suicide by fire . Now that the multi-million dollar standoff is over , a few things remain : cleaning up the mess , and assigning blame . \ From the onset of the April 19 tear gas attacks by federal agents , President Clinton already started passing the buck by saying `` Talk to the attorney general or the FBI ... I knew it was going to be done , but the decision was { \it entirely theirs } . { \it They } made the tactical decision . '' Enter Attorney General Janet Reno . After most of the Branch Davidians died , Reno said she took `` full responsibility '' for the decision . `` I approved the plan '' she said adding that she `` did not advise him [ Clinton ] as to the details . '' In fact , she told Clinton that it was `` the best way to go . '' As the fire was roaring through the Branch Davidian 's compound Clinton said that he was `` deeply sadened by the loss of life '' and in the same breath that `` the law enforcement agencies involved in the Waco siege recommended the course of action pursued today . '' Later he went on to say `` I stand by that [ Reno 's ] decision . '' \ How did this all begin ? At 0930 on February 28 agents of the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms ( BATF ) launched a full-scale , high-profile assault on the Branch Davidian 's compound . This raid was much more than an assault on a group suspected of possessing illegal weapons . The assault was a planned media circus used as a propaganda device of the BATF to show their might and just purpose . \ At the onset of the `` no-knock '' raid , gaggles of heavily armed BATF agents made their way inside the compound without identifying themselves or state that they had a warrant until long after the shooting began . Silently , the agents made their way to the compound 's buildings and started their `` search '' by charging at the buildings and throwing concussion grenades and ordering the cult members to come out of the buildings . \ If unknown persons dressed in black ninja costumes and combat fatigues were to attack you , throwing grenades and brandishing firearms , would you not assume that these people are criminals and attempt to defend yourself ? The tactics employed by the BATF provoked the battle . \ The initial assualt by the BATF was not successful . Unfortunately , lives were lost on both sides . But , had the assault been a success , the liberal media would have praised the BATF by showing the footage of BATF agents carting away a bunch of gun-wielding religious nuts . Of course , any violation of the cult 's rights would have been overlooked and the media would proclaim America 's fortune in having super-cop organizations like the BATF that can systematically `` take out '' terroristic groups such as the Branch Davidians . \ As far as I can see , the BATF and the FBI dropped the ball - just like Philadelphia did in the 1985 MOVE crisis which left 11 dead , 250 homeless , and a city block razed . It appears that the BATF has adopted the shoot-first tactic of no-knock raids to execute search warrants . Do n't let the BATF convince you that the no-knock raid was justified . No-knock assaults make sense when looking for , say , drugs that can easily be hidden or disposed of in a few seconds . The BATF was looking for illegal weapons , not drugs that could be hidden or flushed down the toilet in a matter of a few seconds . What ever happened to `` This is the police ! You are surrounded ... '' ? { \it This policy of no-knock raids , by federal and local agencies , should be restricted } . Further , the use of military firepower against presumed innocent citizens is a very scary idea , and is why the Davidians were justified in using lethal force to ensure that their fourth ammendment rights [ `` the right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures '' ] are not denied . \ \ \ \noindent Matthew L.

THINK , man . The BATF are serving a warrant on someone who they feel might have illegal automatic weapons . If they expected , as you state , that ` the B-D to be anything other than peaceful citizens ' they could have sent one , maybe two agents up to the front door , knock , and attempt to serve the warrant on the person answering the door . Scenario one , that person lets them in to perform the search and no one gets hurt . Scenario two , the person answering the door pulls a weapon aand kills both officers . Now you have two dead BATF agents instead of four , the BATF knows exactly where they stand with regards to the BD and began to formulate a plan of action to arrest those responsible without harm to the innocent people/children within the compound . > > The stupidity was the attempt to serve a warant on the place by > ludicrously underarmed and unprotected police .

From : wtm @ uhura.neoucom.edu ( Bill Mayhew ) Subject : Re : Laser vs Bubblejet ? Organization : Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine Lines : 90 There is a cartridge capping upgrade for older deskjet printers available from hewlett-packard . Older original deskjet and possibly deskjet 500 units may have a black plastic slide with rubber capping components in the cartrige parking area on the right side ( viewed from front ) of the printer . Newer printers have a gray or white plastic slide . The black plastic slide can allow your cartridge to dry out . There was and may still be information packaged with ink cartridges explaining the situation . HP placed a coupon for a free upgrade kit to modernize old deskjets to the new capping mechanism . I did this on my printer and did indeed find that the cartidges now last longer . I do n't have the information handy . I suggest contacting your nearest HP service center for information on obtaining the kit . HP has upgrade kits that consist of electronics and mechanical components that vary depending on the starting level printer and the level to which you wish to upgrade . I upgraded my original desket to a dekjet 500 . The kit was fairly expensive . You are likely better off selling your old printer and purchasing a new deskjet 500 now that prices have declined so much . Upgrading an original deskjet to 500 requires a fair amount of skill , but no soldering . Upgrading a deskjet plus to a 500 is involves swapping the processor card and changing a few minor parts . Contact your HP service center for further information . The PCL language used by Deskjets is considerably different from the PCL used by laser printers , especially the newer laser printers . The biggest problem is dumb laser drivers that send a raster end command after each scan line . This makes no material difference for lasers , but causes the deskjet to print the accumulated raster . As you might guess , the result is hideously slow printing . The new DOS Wordperfect print deskjet drivers are still guilty of this particular behavior . From the way Wordperfect works , this would not be easy to change . Windows Wordperfect works efficiently unless you use the DOS drivers instead of Windows ' . The PCL4 dialect used in the Laserjet IIIP allows compression that permits a full page 300 dpi image to be rendered with only one megabyte of memory . An uncompressed image could be as large as about 909 Kbytes , but the printer needs about 300K of memory for its internal house-keeping . Laserjet IV models support banded printing that allows incrmental download of the image with compression in limited memory situations . Deskjet downloadable fonts are not compatible with laserjet fonts . A single page from a laserjet only requires about 20 seconds . This is faster than any but the most trivial printing from a deskjet printer . The presumption , of course , being that the laser printer has completed its warm-up cyle . Until ink chemistry is changed , wicking resulting in image deterioration is unavoidable . I wo n't use the word impossible , but matching laser quality output from a deskjet printer is unlikely . Chosing an appropriate paper type helps , but does not eliminate the problem . Laser printers are more wastful of energy and consumable components . HP does accept return of spent toner cartridges , mitigating the material waste problem to a degree . Energy waste could use more work . Warm-up times have decreased , allowing stand-by current consumption to be significantly reduced in the laserjet IV . Kyocera produces a laser print engine that employs an amorphous silicon imaging drum with a replacable toner system . The image drum is good for approximately 100K copies . It is a very nice print engine . I wish HP used the Kyocera engine . Kyocera also has a neat modular paper source and stacker system . The recommended duty cycle for a deskjet is significantly lower than any of HP 's laser printers . The pick-up pressure rollers are subject to wear and I case confirm eventually do wear out . The usual symptom is that the printer becomes reluctant to feed paper . The paper feed is integrated in a transport mechanism that is a single part from HP service . Replacement cost for the transport is almost $ 200 . The feed rollers are not separately replacable , though it would not be a difficult job for a competent technician . I have disassembled and reassembled the transport on my own printer . It depends upon the application which printer is best for you . If you only print 5 or 10 pages a day and are satisfied with the appearance of output , the deskjet is a very good choice . As noted , the deskjet 500 is my choice for personal use . -- Bill Mayhew NEOUCOM Computer Services Department Rootstown , OH 44272-9995 USA phone : 216-325-2511 wtm @ uhura.neoucom.edu ( 140.220.1.1 ) 146.580 : N8WED

Sounds like snake oil for the 1990 's : - ) Where are your references ? I have been unable to find studies that state that chromium `` cures diabetese '' . It can reduce the amount of insulin you have to take . `` High blood pressure '' - I have never heard of this claim before . `` ... anabolic steroids '' - I have also never heard of this claim before . Sounds like you are making things up and stretching the truth for God knows what reason . Did somebody piss you off at one time ? | > On the other hand , it really cant hurt you anywhere but your wallet , and place | > bo effects of anything can be pretty dramatic ... I agree with you that chromium picolinate by itself is n't likely to make a fat person thin . But it can be the decisive component of an overall strategy for long-term weight control and make an important contribution to good health . It is important to exercise ( 11 , 12 ) and also avoid fat calories ( 9 , 10 ) . Chromium picolinate has shown to reduce fat and increase lean muscle ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) . I will not bore you with the statistics . You would n't believe these anyway . Chromium Picolinate is an exceptionally bioactive source of the essential mineral chromium . Chromium plays a vital role in `` sensitizing '' the body 's tissues to the hormone insulin . Weight gain in the form of fat tends to impair sensitivity to insulin and thus , in turn , makes it harder to lose weight ( 4 ) . Insulin directly stimulates protein synthesis and retards protein breakdown in muscles ( 5 , 6 ) . This `` protein sparing '' effect of insulin tends to decline during low calorie diets as insulin levels decline , which results in loss of muscle and organ tissue . By `` sensitizing '' muscle to insulin , chromium picolinate helps to preserve muscle in dieters so that they `` burn '' more fat and less muscle . Preservation of lean body mass has an important long-term positive effect on metabolic rate , helping dieters keep off the fat they 've lost . Chromium picolinate promotes efficient metabolism by aiding the thermogenic ( heat producing ) effects of insulin . Insulin levels serve as a rough index of the availability of food calories , so it 's not at all surprising that insulin stimulates metabolism ( 4 , 7 , 8 ) . Note that I did not say that chromium picolinate increases metabolism . In summary , you need to change your life style in order to loose weight and stay healthy : A . Reduce dietary fat consumption to no more than 20 % of calories . - Eating fat makes you fat . B . Increase dietary fiber - low in calories ; high in nutrients . C. Get regular aerobic exercise at least 3 times a week - burn calories . D. Take chromium picolinate daily - lose fat ; keep muscle References : 1 . Kaats GR , Fisher JA , Blum K.

Questionable conduct is more appropriately called unethical ( in my opinion ) . I 'll give you some examples . 1 . Prescribing controlled substances to patients with no demonstrated need ( other than a drug addition ) for the medication . 2 . Prescribing thyroid preps for patients with normal thyroid function for the purpose of quick weight loss . 3 . Using laetril to treat cancer patients when such treatment has been shown to be ineffective and dangerous ( cyanide release ) by the NCI . These are errors of commission that competently trained physicians should not committ but sometimes do . There are also errors of omission ( some of which result in malpractice suits ) . I do n't think that using anti-fungal agents to try to relieve discomfort in a patient who you suspect may be having a problem with candida ( or another fungal growth ) is an error of commission or omission . Healers have had a long history of trying to relieve human suffering . Some have stuck to standard , approved procedures , others have been willing to try any reasonable treatment if there is a chance that it will help the patient . The key has to be tied to the healer 's oath , `` I will do no harm '' . But you know David that very few treatments involve no risk to the patient . The job of the physician is a very difficult one when risk versus benefit has to be weighed . Each physician deals with this risk/benefit paradox a little differently . Some are very conservative while others are more agressive . An agressive approach may be more costly to the patient and carry more risk but as long as the motive is improving the patient 's health and not an attempt to rake in lots of money ( through some of the schemes that have been uncovered in the medicare fraud cases ) , I do n't see the need to label these healers as quacks or even unethical . What do I reserve the term quack for ? Pseudo-medical professionals . These people lurk on the fringes of the health care system waiting for the frustrated patient to fall into their lair . Some of these individuals are really doing a pretty good job of providing `` alternative '' medicine . But many lack any formal training and are in the `` business '' simply to make a few fast bucks . While a patient can be reasonably assured of getting competent care when a liscenced physician is consulted , this alternative care area is really a buyer 's beware arena . If you are lucky , you may find someone who can help you . If you are unlucky , you can loose a lot of money and develop severe disease because of the inability of these pseudo- medical professional to diagnose disease ( which is the fortay of the liscened physicians ) . I hope that this clears things up David . Marty B .

This is a very good point . I have already made the clear claim that Khomeini advocates views which are in contradition with the Qur'an and have given my arguments for this . This is something that can be checked by anyone sufficiently interested . Khomeini , being dead , really ca n't respond , but another poster who supports Khomeini has responded with what is clearly obfuscationist sophistry . This should be quite clear to atheists as they are less susceptible to religionist modes of obfuscationism . So , to answer your question , the only way you can judge is by learning more about Islam , that is by reading the Qur'an and understanding it 's basic principles . Once one has done this it is relatively easy to see who is following the principles of Islam and who is acting in a way at odds with Islam . Khomeini by attributing a superhuman status to twelve muslim historical leaders is at variance with one of basic principles of Islam , which is that no human being is metaphysically different than any other human being and in no sense any closer to God in metaphysical nature .

Center for Regional Studies Lines : 53 May 13 , 1993 _Five Russian soldiers sentenced to death in Azerbaijan_ MOSCOW ( UPI ) -- Five soldiers who served in Russia 's 7th army stationed in Armenia were sentenced to death in the Azerbaijani capital Baku Thursday for allegedly `` carrying out diversions and killing 30 Azeri soldiers . '' A statement released by the news service of Azeri President Abulfaz Elchibey said `` the sentence was final and was not subject to protest or appeal , '' the Russian state news agency Itar-tass reported . But the Russian Foreign Ministry issued an appeal for the men to be handed over to the authorities in Moscow for punishment . `` This would accord with modern standards of humanity towards those who have committed crimes , '' the statement reads . The five men , together with another soldier who received a 15-year prison sentence , were captured in September 1992 by Azeri police in the Kelbadzhar district of Azerbaijan , between Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia . The Supreme Court in Baku said the men had gone through special training in a company of the Russian 7th army in the Armenian capital Yerevan , after which they were sent across the Armenian-Azeri border into Nagorno-Karabakh to carry out diversions against Azeri troops . However , the Russian Foreign Ministry statement claimed they had deserted the Russian army and were fighting as mercenaries with Armenian armed forces in the battle zone round Karabakh . Nagorno-Karabakh is an Armenian-populated enclave within Azerbaijan which for five years has been fighting for independence from Baku in a war that has left many thousands dead and uprooted hundreds of thousands from their homes . Both Yerevan and Baku have always claimed that Russian servicemen stationed in these Caucasian republics , who were left behind after the break-up of the Soviet Union , are fighting as mercenaries in the Karabakh war . The statement from Moscow said the Russian side repeatedly appealed to the Azerbaijani government to show humanity and leniency in their treatment of the six men , and to hand them over to the Russian authorities . It said that President Boris Yeltsin himself sent a letter with this request to his Azeri counterpart Elchibey . Itar-tass said that the soldiers ' defense attorneys had lodged an appeal for clemency . -- David Davidian dbd @ urartu.sdpa.org | `` Armenia has not learned a lesson in S.D.P.A .

I hereby state that I am not claiming or denying membership in any Order , fraternity etc . with or without the word `` Rosicrucian '' in the name of the organization . I only claim having done some `` homework '' : - ) This is intended as a friendly article and if at times it seems different , it 's my lack of writing skills showing , nothing else . Heck , English may be my second language ! ( And then again maybe not by now : - ) I proceed : > > I had an ehum , interesting experience with the Rosicrucians , or at > least Rosicrucians of some sort last Sunday . > Let 's start with the name `` Rosicrucian '' . I took me a long time to come to the conclusion that there is a difference between a *member* of a '' rosicrucian '' body and BEING *a* ROSICRUCIAN . So when you say that you met some 'rosicrucians ' you mean `` members of a group that calls themselves rosicrucian '' . At least that is what your observation suggests : - ) I 'd prefer if you would have stated up front that it was the Lectorium Rosicrucianum , only because they may be confused , by some readers of this newsgroup , with the Rosicrucian Order AMORC based ( the USA Jurisdiction ) in San Jose , CA ; this being the RC org with the most members ( last time I looked ) . Of course , `` most members '' does not *necessarily* mean `` best '' . Anyway , the Lectorium Rosicrucianum claims they descend ( at least in part ) from what was the `` Gold-und-Rosenkreuz '' ( Golden and Rosy Cross ) , from the 18th century . There were two `` Golden and Rosy Cross '' , the first ( chronologically ) more alchemical , the second with Masonic tinges , but their history is the subject of a complete chapter : - ) . `` You 'll have to trust me '' when I tell you that if that lecture/class/whatever had been presented by AMORC , it is unlikely that you would have had the same impression , i.e. , you 'd probably have had a positive impression more likely than a negative one , IMHO . > The first guy also said that the R : s are a mystical Christian order , and > that they base their teachings on the teachings of the Kathars > ( English ? ) from the thirteenth century . > Again , instead of R : s , it should be `` Lectorium Rosicrucianum '' : - ) . It is curious to know that 3 other RC 'orders ' ( in the USA ) claim to be *non- sectarian* . The Cathars were a 'heretic ' christian sect that directly challenged the 'authority ' of the medieval catholic church . They flourished during the 12th century , century which saw the religious zeal expressed in the crusades and also the growing disillusion with the catholic church and the worldly ways of its clerics . It was largely in response to the church's unseemly pomp and splendor that Catharism took root , first in northern Italy , then throughout the south of France . > What made me a bit suspicious , was the way they first said that we all > contained something divine , and could find our way back to divinity , > then that we could n't become divine as the persons we are currently , > but if we worked really hard we would reach eternal bliss . I do n't see nothing *fundamentally* wrong with `` us containing something divine '' ... And yes I do n't like phrases like `` eternal bliss '' either ! : - ) > How to robotize people and brainwash ... > For a moment I thought you were referring to Madison Ave : - ) ( Madison avenue in New York City is where the most influential ( read $ $ $ ) *commercial* advertising is produced here in the USA : - ) Peace , Tony BTW , I have read the intro letters of the LRC which they will mail you free of charge .

These memoirs include an interview between Aharonian and British Foreign Minister Lord Curzon in which above-mentioned genocide was discussed . The official report mentioned by Lord Curzon is the report of British High Commissioner to Caucasia , Sir Oliver Wardrop .

The estimated population of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000 , of whom 940,000 ( 20 percent ) were Armenian , 1,200,000 ( 25 percent ) Georgian , and 2,220,000 ( 45 percent ) Moslem . Of the latter group , 1,140,000 were Tatars . Paradoxically , barely one-third of Transcaucasia 's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia , where the Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds . Erevan uezd , the administrative center of the province , had only 44,000 Armenians as compared to 68,000 Moslems . By the time of the Russian Census of 1897 , however , the Armenians had established a scant majority , 53 percent , in the guberniia ; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent , or 670,000 of the 1,120,000 inhabitants . This impressive change in the province 's ethnic character notwithstanding , there was , on the eve of the creation of the Armenian Republic , a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the southern districts , from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia .

Our artillery knocked the huts into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable and inhabitants fled from them into fields , bullets and bayonets completed the work . Some of the Tartars escaped of course . They found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border into Turkey . The rest were killed . And so it is that the whole length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of Tartar villages .

The observation is indirect , but no more so than observations I have made of atoms . Also , what about observations and experiments that have been routinely done with individual atoms . I am thinking in particular of atom trapping experiments and tests of fundamental quantum mechanics such as the quantum Zeno effect , where an individual atom is studied for a long period of time . Some of the attempts at quantum mechanical arguments were not very satisfying either . One has to be carefull about making such arguments without a solid technical background in the field . What I read seemed a little confused a quite a red herring . Anyway , if the purpose of a public debate is to make the audience think , it worked . After doing so , I 'm willing to try to defend the following assertion if anyone cares : Atoms are as real as trees , and are real in the ussual every-day sense of the word `` real '' .

Count rates are too low and signal rise times too long for this to be possible . The CGRO , is , what , 10 meters long ? You'd need to time to an accuracy of nanoseconds to do this . What BATSE actually does is measure the relative strength in each of the detectors ( also as a function of photon energy ) . Each of the detectors does not have isotropic response . To do this right one must model the scattering of photons in the material around each detector , and even scattering of photons off the Earth 's atmosphere back onto the spacecraft . I believe they have now reduced the error to about 2 degrees . Paul F. Dietz dietz @ cs.rochester.edu

Perhaps it appeared differently at the ballpark . Personally , I was amazed that Gant did n't get ejected . But that 's why Cox did ; it 's called protecting your players . And to those people who would have thrown everyone out of the game , all I can say is that you 'd be making baseball history . Even in the worst baseball brawls , usually only the major instigators are ejected , not everyone who comes onto the field . And I 'd have to say that those brawls are considerably more threatening to the game than what the Braves did Fri. night . Anyhow , that 's my last two cents on the subject , barring outrageous postings . I will try to keep my eyes open for more incidents involving Hirschbeck .

From : mls @ panix.com ( Michael Siemon ) Subject : Re : ARSENOKOITAI : NT Meaning of Organization : Panix Public Access Internet & Unix , NYC Lines : 209 Meta-exegesis : Conviction of Sin , part II Let me return to the question , stipulating that Paul meant his use of _arseonkoitai_ to refer more or less exactly to the Levitical prohibition of male-male sex . In order to bring out the problems most clearly , I'll also stipulate ( what I think is far less plausible ) that Paul coined the term for this usage . The question I want to turn to is what that would mean for Paul 's readers and for later Christians . This should be shorter than my last note , as we will see that this question rapidly confronts us with some of the major divisions within Christ 's body , and I am not trying to open the gates for flames across any of the terrible chasms that separate any of us from our fellow Christians . My own biases ( loosely characterizable as `` liberal '' ) will be evident , but I am not grinding an axe here , so much as trying to get all parties to see that it may be HARD to reach `` closure '' when the issues involved strike at the heart of what we each , in our own different ways , see as crucial to the Gospel of Christ . So ; stipulating Paul 's intent , the immediate question is : HOW CAN HIS READERS UNDERSTAND this intent ? And following on that question , there is a second one : WHAT IS OUR PROPER ACTION if we *do* manage to understand him ? Since Paul gives not a single clue about his meaning in the text of 1st Corinthians , there are two `` positive '' answers and one `` negative '' to this question : + a. Paul ( or Apollos , or someone ) in the apostolic community has conveyed to the Corinthians the then-traditional Jewish condem- nation of homosexual behavior , and Paul expects them to be sufficiently well-tutored by this tradition that he needs no futher explanation . [ I should note that there is no evidence in the letter , or in 2 Corinthians for such a supposition : - ) ] + b . The Spirit will teach us what Paul means ( or , if not Paul , what God means `` behind '' Paul 's inspired word-choice . ) - c. We *don't* know , and can not guess to within any better pre- cision here than , for comparison , in the parallel use by Paul , in the same passage of the word _pleonektai_ ( `` those who have more '' -- if you think that _areseonkoitai_ is `` obvious '' from its roots , try cutting your teeth on *this* word ! The NEB translates it as `` grabbers '' ) or even _methusoi_ ( `` drunkards '' -- at least this has the advantage of being a common insult , so that at least there is *some* hint as to its meaning ! ) The three positions more or less -- if I can be allowed some exaggeration for the sake of argument -- define a classical Catholic attitude towards tradition , one form of Protestant _sola scriptura_ , and a liberal/critical demand for evidence . All three positions have strengths and weaknesses . _ad_ a : It is unquestionable that the gospel was preached in and by the community of Christ 's disciples and their successors , and that our NT scripture itself emerges from this communal tradition . But it 's also the case that we know little or nothing about this tradition until almost a century after Paul , which is to say that we have access to the tradition only after several generations of possibly confused transmission . The scripture is itself our only documentation of the tradition in the critical era . _ad_ b : If we are NOT born of water and Spirit [ to revert to John in an attempt to explain Paul : - ) ] , then we have no more hope of under- standing the gospel than Nicodemus had ; neither the traditions of men nor the vain elevation of our own reason can prevent the Spirit from blowing where it will -- the Paraclete is a kamikaze . But the downside of Protestant belief in the efficacy of the Spirit as our guide in scripture is that the wing of Protestantism that takes this most seriously is also the most fragmented over divergent understanding supposedly derived from the `` clear '' Word of God . [ Note : classical Lutheran , Calvinist and Anglican thought constrains scripture to be read *within* tradition , even while reserving judgment against tradition out of scripture ; the more bizarre forms of `` I will read Scripture my way '' are primarily a fringe aspect of `` cultic '' Protestantism . ] The main problem with this approach is that there is apparently no means for ONE person to convey to another what that one may feel *is* teaching received from the Spirit ; and history shows incredible conflict between Christians on this point , each in his own mind '' convinced '' that he is led by the Spirit . No one can seriously urge point b without SOME sense of its potential for setting Christian against Christian . To what purpose ? _ad_ c : The critical approach has the distinct advantage that when it can reach a conclusion , it can lay out the data in a way which is open to all . The weakness is an obvious corollary : this is not usually possible . : - ) [ If I may say a word here , out of my own already acknowledged bias ; one complaint against critical methodology is that it `` dissolves '' faith -- but surely a `` faith '' that can not honestly face the evalu- ation of evidence has problems which mere theology is helpless to address . ] Anyway , there is a serious and unfortunate possibility of schism between '' liberal '' and `` conservative '' positions , mostly on the basis of extreme zealots of positions b and c. A Catholic sense of authority and tradition tends to constrain arguments of b contra c to secondary position , so that despite horrendous strains Rome is NOT as likely to find these issues as ultimately divisive as the Protestant world will . And Anglicans will ( I predict ) muddle through on the _via media_ , attempting to give each position its due , but no more than its due . Second question . Suppose tradition tells us , and lots of `` spiritual '' Christians tell us , and critical thought at least admits as possible , that Paul is refering to a flat , universal Levitical prohibition against male-male sex . What then ? Again , we can abdicate our personal responsi- bility to tradition , and let it dictate the answer . But it 's precisely where inherited traditions are NOT questioned that they 're most dangerous . We have EXAMPLES of Christ questioning the Pharisees and THEIR use of tradition ( despite his urging , in Matthew 23:2 that we are to heed them ) . We have EXAMPLES of Peter , and more radically still Paul , jettisoning the traditions that THEY were led by the Spirit to call into question . Jesus and Peter and Paul do not so much `` throw out '' tradition as subject it to radical criticism , on a couple of very basic grounds : `` the weightier demands of the law : justice and mercy and good faith '' ( Matthew 23:23 ) and `` On these two commandments [ love God & neighbor ] hand the whole Law , and the Prophets , also . '' ( Matthew 22:40 ) If there is a fundamental ( because derived from Christ ) validity in the challenge to *some* traditions , a validity that led the first generation to go so far as to waive application of the Torah to gentile converts ( vastly beyond anything that is directly deducible from Jesus ' reported words and deeds ) , it signifies to me a certain failure of the imagination to *postulate* that *only* the traditions that we have specific challenges against are in fact open to challenge . All traditions passed *through* men are traditions *of* men . That God may lead us even so , that these traditions are a source of our spiritual instruction I will freely grant . But tradition is inherently human , and inherently corruptible ( and given the Fall , corrupt ) . Nothing in it is immune to challenge , when the Spirit shows us a failure in justice , mercy and good faith . Nothing may ultimately stand unless it DOES follow from love of God and love of neighbor . I am perfectly willing to grant that I could be blind to my own sin . That the Spirit may have taught another what She refuses to teach me ( or I am too dense to learn ) . That tradition *might* have value here . But what I *know* of tradition is that on one occasion , some superstitious Christians appealed to Justinian after an earthquake in Asia Minor , and scapegoated '' sodomites '' as the `` cause '' of the earthquake , so that legislation was passed making homosexual behavior a capital offense . If that is in accord with the gospel of Christ , then I am no Christian . That is human tradition at its most hateful and vicious . And I see nothing all that much different in all the unbidden eruptions onto USENET of people who are quick to condemn but slow to understand . If that is the leading of the Spirit , then I want no part of it . But what I have found in obedience to the Lord is that I am , myself , TOTALLY dependent on the witness of other Christians , for the truth that lives in the Body of Christ . And I say to all who doubt that gay Christianity is from God what Gamaliel said to doubting Pharisees who would have suppressed the earliest Church : '' be careful how you deal with these people ... If this enterprise , this movement of theirs , is of human origin it will break up of its own accord ; but if it does in fact come from God you will not only be unable to destroy them , but you might find yourselves fighting against God . '' [ Acts 5:36 ... 39 ] All I ask is that you listen to your traditions , and read your scriptures with a mind and soul OPEN to the Spirit , and to the past history of our first Christian witnesses ' willingness to challenge tradition and OTHER readings of scripture -- though read with all the authority of scribes and rabbis -- and a submission to the declaration that all must depend on the love of God and neighbor . Then , study the evidence ; learn the history of Christians oppressing Christians out of their traditions and eagerness to judge where Jesus and Paul tell us NOT to judge . And let the witness of the Spirit in the lives of your fellow Christians -- including those who are NOT of your preference in theology -- guide you towards God 's truth . -- Michael L. Siemon I say `` You are gods , sons of the mls @ panix.com Most High , all of you ; nevertheless - or - you shall die like men , and fall mls @ ulysses.att..com like any prince . '' Psalm 82:6-7 [ There 's a certain ambiguity in your discussion of position ( a ) , as to whether you 're speaking of tradition in Paul 's time or ours . I think there are two ways to use tradition . One is to say that when Paul and his readers share a tradition , it makes sense to interpret his words in the context of that shared tradition . That 's what makes me think that these arguments over words turn out to be silly . We know that Paul came out of a background that was rather Puritanical on sex . Everything else he says on sex is consistent with that background . The tone of his remarks on homosexuality in Rom 1 is consistent with that background . Even if the words in the sin lists are n't the most general terms for homosexual activity ( and it seems to me that there's some evidence that they are not ) , they are just one more piece of evidence for something we would probably be willing to believe with no evidence at all -- that Paul shares the common Jewish rejection of homosexuality . But when you identify ( a ) with the Catholic position , that 's rather a horse of a different color . The Catholic position involves a continuing church tradition . Arguments specific to that tradition might be ( 1 ) we can get guidance on how to interpret Paul 's original meaning from tradition , e.g . the way the Church Fathers interpreted him , and ( 2 ) we gain confidence that his prohibitions still apply in our time because of the universal judgement of the church between his time and ours . I think this is a somewhat different use of tradition . A radical Protestant might be willing to use known 1st Cent . tradition to illuminate Paul 's original meaning , but not use the Catholic position to answer the question of what our own attitude to homosexuality should be . -- clh ]

Are you going to comdemn national media , then turn around > and use it to support some position you present ? Seems somewhat contradictory > does n't it . I believe that this is not contradictory on the basis that the quality of media reporting varies greatly based on the subject at hand . The media has proven itself very accurate is the areas of presenting raw , undisputed data . One good example would be the weather page in which high and low temperatures of the previous day for a large number of locations are posting . There is little evidence to show that they are in error . The American media has failed us in its analysis of complex events , however . I 'm sure that we can come up with many news stories that have left us angry because so many facts have been ommitted . Cases that come to mind are the invasion of Panama , the war with Iraq , the disaster in Waco , the issues surrounding the acceptance of gays into the military , the war on drugs , and many others . The story that you bring to light was regarding the new sex survey . While I 'm sure that due to lazyness some of the data was ommitted from the article , I would venture to guess that the data that was presented did not deviate from the survey . I do , however , think that it would be folly to have blind faith in a single newswriter's analysis of this data . In this particular case , there was little analysis , and the reader was left to draw his/her own convictions . Many netters , Mr. Cramer included , often forget that the American media are merely a number of businesses , who's purpose in life is to make money for their owners and stockholders . Revenues come largely from advertisers who merely want maximum useful exposure per dollar . The media is like fast food ; the quality of the food ( or of the reporting ) will improve only if the customers demand as such . Otherwise , it is business as usual . -- Mark Walsh ( walsh @ optilink ) -- UUCP : uunet ! optilink ! walsh Amateur Radio : KM6XU @ WX3K -- AOL : BigCookie @ aol.com -- USCF : L10861 '' What , me worry ?

The Irgun did not want to kill any civilians . The > village had almost 1000 inhabitants , most of whom survived . > > Harry . This is such Bullshit . Deir Yassin was an unprovoked attack on the part of the Jews , and a massacre defines it best in my opinion . The village of Deir Yassin had had a pact with the Jews , a peace pact , but the Irgun purposely broke this agreement in order to scare off the Palestinians . I might grant that this village housed armed Arabs [ I doubt it ] but nothing in the archives and available literature indicates that this was a motivating force amongst the Irgun . The Deir Yassin MASSACRE was part of an over all strategy to intimidate the Palestinians to flee the Jewish Homeland. , ... and contrary to your belief , many civilians were killed . Deir Yassin was later advertized by the very Jews who perpetrated it because it was useful in getting many Palestinians to leave . The Palestinians were rightfully scared off , because they did not want another Deir Yassin . I 'm not necessarily condemning the Israelites here ; atrocities were aslo committed on the part of the Arabs . Israelophiles should just be careful in thinking that they are and were the good guys in the middle east . Both Arab and Jew suck equally .

I am doubting a claim presented without any evidence to support it . If you are able to present real evidence for it , then great . But unsupported claims , or even claims by such and such news agency will not be accepted . If you want to stick to the sheer impossible , instead of the merely difficult , then fine . The statement that if such a fact is classified , then you ca n't prove it , is a simple matter of pragmatics and the law . If you have access to classified information that you know to be classified , and you reveal it , there is a good chance that you or someone else ( the person who revealed it to you ) , is going to jail . I never said that you could n't prove it to my satisfaction , I merely said that it was difficult .

The survey presented , according to Mr. Cramer , a value called the median- which one used this makes us believe that 1/2 of the males had 7.3 plus sex partners and 1/2 of the males had 7.3 or less sex partners . Homosexuals are purported to make up only 1 % . In this case , the majority of people with 7.3 plus sex partners are heterosexual . It is my feeling that median was not the intended word usage . But if it is then we have little evidence to support Mr. Cramer claims about gay promiscuity > hetero promiscuity . > > Many netters , Mr. Cramer included , often forget that the > American media are merely a number of businesses , who's > purpose in life is to make money for their owners and > stockholders .

The News Media is a business and as such becomes skewed because of where its loyalties lie . There is an old statement by a man ( and I can not remember him or his statment exactly ) but it warns against the merger of business and news reporting , because of the obvious consequences .

From : mussack @ austin.ibm.com ( Christopher Mussack ) Subject : What _do_ we feel ? Lines : 35 I see a parallel between what I will stupidly call the `` homosexual '' issue and the `` atheist '' issue . Please take no offense at these comparisons . The homosexual `` feels '' things that I admit I do not `` feel '' . He learns that these feelings are classified as homosexual feelings and learns of a model of sexuality that seems to apply to his feelings , which he then can fit with his experiences . That is , this model gives him a sense of understanding his situation . Models that do not match up with what he knows he feels will be discarded . However , one wonders if once accepting the idea of his being gay and deciding what exactly that means he will analyze all his feelings and experiences based on the definition he has already accepted , which of course validates his model . If that was hard to understand now listen to my parallel . The Christian `` feels '' things that an atheist claims he does not feel . The Christian accepts the Christian theology as the true description of what his feelings mean . Once accepting this model he interprets his experiences with regards to this model which of course validates his Christianity . As a reminder , I am a Christian , a Catholic , I do n't hate homosexuals or atheists , but am just trying to understand them . I only compare them because they are both so foreign to me . Am I as blind to the homosexual as the atheist seems blind to me ? Or am I as prejudiced against atheistic denial of religious experience as the homosexual is prejudiced against attempts by society to deny his sexuality ? Or am I just out to lunch , again ?

Dear Senator/Congressman/President { fill in the blank } I am writing you to voice my strong opposition to President Clinton 's Clipper Chip initiative . This proposal to establish a secret government designed cryptography chip with government key registration as the standard for voice encryption is very disturbing . The idea that citizens must register their secrets with the government just in case they are trying to keep them secret is patently unAmerican . Additionally , the press release for this program strongly implied that other forms of cryptography would be banned after the Clipper Chip standard is in place . This latest attack on our civil rights is deeply disturbing and is frankly a voting issue for me . The presidents press release stated that the plan strikes a balance between the legitimate needs of law enforcement and a citizens right to privacy but this is not the case . The fact is that since other strong cryptographic equipment is avalible the criminals , drug dealers and terrorists mentioned in the press release will simply use non clipper cryptography . Meanwhile the average citizen may gain no protection against warentless wiretaps by the government since the government escrowed key is derived deterministicly from the unit serial number which is broadcast by the chip durring its opperation . This seems like an obvious back door for the NSA and law enforcement . If you still do nott understand my objection to key registration , consider the way J. Edgar Hoover blackmailed government officials like yourself ; would you now use a phone to transmit personal details of your life that the NSA and FBI have the keys to ? ______________________________________________________________________________ Well heres a letter , I didnt spell check it since I dont know how in EMACS so you might want to do that .

While I 'm all for cutting down the number of chain-rattles and other examples of rampant Hargroving , there was a difference here . 1 ) Since time immemorial , batters have complained about calls . So have pitchers and catchers . Usually , nothing happens . Unless the league notified teams this year about not allowing complaints , Hirschbeck was acting against expectations . 2 ) It 's not as if Gant was `` in Hirschbeck 's face '' . Gant said something about the call , stepped out of the box , and turned away from Hirschbeck . As a hitter ( alibet of little consequence , but with a decent eye ) , whenever receiving the short end of the stick on a questionable call , I 'd want a moment or two out of the box , if for no other reason than to rethink the strike zone based on the experience of the last pitch . And if I was really angry at the ump , I 'd rather turn away and catch my breath than turn to him and say something that might get me tossed , especially at a key moment in the game . When Gant turned away , Hirschbeck IMMEDIATELY motioned for Gant to step into the box . IMO , at this point in time , Hirschbeck was determined to show Gant exactly WHO was in charge of this game . Gant was n't dawdling ; he had n't had a chance to dawdle . And Hirschbeck was simply exercising a power play . Gant resisted , as many of us might to what we thought was an unreasonable request , and Hirschbeck called for the pitch . At that point , Cox came out on the field , the pitch was thrown , and many other Braves left the dugout . Cox was tossed `` protecting his player '' . I was pleasantly surprised that Gant kept his cool enough to stay in the game . It 's a small sample size , but based on what I saw in that game , Mark Hirschbeck has a hair-trigger temper and a need to play God on the field . Not good qualities for an umpire . I will keep my eyes open for future appearances of Hirschbeck in the future , in order to improve my sample size . IMO , any game where you remember the name of the umpire was a bad game for the umpire . Eric Roush

From : rlhunt @ amoco.com ( Randy L. Hunt ) Subject : LOVE in the morning : by Malcolm Smith Ministries Lines : 184 -- -- - Begin Included Message -- -- - The following teaching is brought to you on behalf of Malcolm Smith Ministries , a ministry dedicated to leading believers everywhere into a knowledge of the love of God . If you would like more info on the ministry , and/or would like to comment on whether you found this teaching beneficial , e-mail to Randy Hunt at rlhunt @ hou.amoco.com . LOVE IN THE MORNING ( Psalm 90:14 ) by Malcolm Smith Moses wrote this prayer at a weary time in the history of Israel . A generation before the time of its writing , the people of Israel had stood at Kadesh , gateway to Canaan , and made the fateful choice to go their own way rather than God 's way . They refused an adventure of faith in God which would have given them Canaan , the homeland of promise . God honored their decision , and said they would wander in the desert only a few miles from the land of promise until they were all buried in the sand . The young decision- makers of that fateful day were between twenty and thirty years old , and destined to be dead within forty years ... bleached bones in the desert by the time they were seventy -- eighty , at the most . The lives of these wanderers had been unending sadness . Moses described it as ending each year with a sigh ( v. 9 ) . The fact that they knew , give or take a few months , when they were going to die , underscored the meaninglessness of their existence . Whatever heights of success they reached , they would be a heap of bleached bones within forty years . The only ones to live outside of that depression of hopeless disbelief were Joshua and Caleb , who had stood against the nation at Kadesh and had God ' s promise of one day entering the land . The forty-year period was finally drawing to an end . The new generation , those who were children at Kadesh , were now grown and eager to take the inheritance their parents had refused to enjoy . In the light of this , Moses prays ... it is time for a new day to begin and the days of misery to be over . All these years , as Moses had walked with these moaning and complaining people through the wilderness of their exile , he had carried a double burden . His was not only the sadness of living in less than what could have been ; but he also knew why they had chosen as they had at Kadesh . The problem was that they were ignorant of the character of their God . If asked . `` Who is your God ? '' they would have described Him as the God who is Power . When Aaron had created their concept of God in an idol . he chose a calf . or young bull -- a symbol of power , of virility . In their minds , God was the young bull who had impaled Pharaoh on his horns and gored Egypt 's gods as He led Israel to Sinai . But when man worships a God of power , His miracles grow thin and even boring . After miracle food on the desert floor and water gushing miraculously from the solid rock through the desert wasteland , the God of Almightiness becomes `` ho-hum -- What ' s next on the miracle menu ? '' And a God of power can be as unpredictable as a young bull calf . He might be all they need , but then ... who knows ? If He has all power , He has a right to do whatever He wants , whenever He wants . The only person these people had known who had absolute power was Pharaoh , and men 's lives had hung on the whim of his moods , which could change with the wind . They believed God could work His wonders on their behalf , but they did not know HIM and , so , could not trust Him . Israel had a God based on what He DID , His acts ; Moses knew the heart of God , the motivation behind the acts . From the day of his encounter at the burning bush , Moses had been fascinated by God . At Sinai , he asked to be shown His glory ... to know who He really was . He had seen what God had done ; he wanted to know who God was . This request was granted , and Moses was given a glimpse of God 's glorious Person . He had come to know the heart of God as compassion and lovingkindness ( Exodus 34:6,7 ) . The word `` lovingkindness '' is not to be understood as a human kind of love . It speaks of the kind of relationship arising out of the making of a covenant . It can only be understood as the love that says , `` I will never leave you nor forsake you . '' Lovingkindness is as tenacious as a British bulldog ; when the world walks out , this love digs in its heels and refuses to leave.And it is not human romantic love , based on feelings and rooted in emotions . It is a love of covenant commitment and , therefore , operates quite apart from feelings . God 's love is not an emotion that wavers day by day ; it is the total commitment of His Being to seek our highest and best , and to bring us to our fullest potential as humans . God does not see something good and beautiful in us which arouses His feelings of love toward us ... we do not woo Him and cause Him to fall in love with us ! If that were the case , the first ugly , sinful thing we did would cause Him to reject us . He is Love , and He loves us because of who He is -- not because of who we are . He does not love what we do , but He is committed to us , pursuing us down every blind alley and bypath of foolishness . He will not let us go . His is a love that is not looking for what it can get out of us -- but a committed love that searches for opportunities to give to us . It is saying to the recipient , `` For as long as we shall live , I am for you . '' The God who has revealed Himself to man through Scripture and , finally , in Jesus -- in His coming , and in His death and resurrection -- is the God who is lovingkindness . Thus He loves us and gives Himself to us ... He will never leave us nor forsake us . Tragically , many believers have never seen Him as love ; they see Him as power . No one will come to faith by just seeing miracles . Miracles point to who He is , and that is when faith springs in the heart . Israel did not see God as lovingkindness ; they saw His acts of power . Moses knew His ways , the kind of God He was , and the love that He had for these people . Because of their total lack of understanding of His love , they could not trust Him to be their strength in taking the land . Faith is born out of knowing the love He has for us ; it is the resting response to the One who gives Himself to us . He is not the force , and to call Him the Almighty is to miss His heart . He is Love who is the Almighty and the Infinite Force . If man is to make force or raw power work for him , he must depend on knowing the forrnula and have faith in it . But the power that issues from love demands faith in the Person of love Himself . The forty years of meaningless wandering was a monument to a people who had never come to know the God of love . At this point , with the new generation and the possibility of enjoying all that God promised , Moses prays verse 14 . The language Moses uses is reminiscent of a baby having slept secure in its mother 's love , now waking to look up into the delight of her eyes . It is waking to the consciousness of being loved ... watched over , cared for , protected , fed , and cleaned , day and night , by the mother . Suppose we were to ask , `` What has the baby done to deserve this ? '' or , `` Have arrangements been made for the child to repay the parents for this inconvenience ? '' Our questions would be considered unnatural , even immoral . The child was conceived in love , anticipated and prepared for with love 's excitement , a love that has been to the gates of death to bring it into being . The parents ' love is unconditional , spontaneous ... it has nothing to do with the looks of the child or its performance . So God is love . He loves us unconditionally , spontaneously . We were conceived in His imagination and fashioned after His image , to be brought to where we are at this moment by the blood of the Lord Jesus . It is slanderous , and immoral , to even ask what we must do to earn and deserve that love . The child discovers its personhood and identity through the eyes and touch , through the cuddles , of its parents ' love . It is a scientific fact that a baby who is not touched and held will probably die or , if it survives , will have severe emotional problems . And a person who has been held and loved will still never know the true meaning of life without the embrace and knowledge of love from God . Moses prays that the new generation will learn to wake every morning , resting with total confidence in the love of God . and will receive all His promises and blessings with joy and gladness . Significantly , Moses prays that they will be SATISFIED with His love . `` Satisfied . '' in the Hebrew language . is a rich picture word describing being filled with an abundance of gourmet food . It is also used to describe the earth after the rain has soaked it and all the vegetation has received enough water . Moses prays that they will awaken every morning to be drenched in the life-giving love of God . That sense of satisfaction is the lifelong quest of every man and woman . When we are satisfied in our deepest selves , many of our emotional -- and even our physical -- problems disappear . Man seeks that sense of satisfaction which comes from feeling that he is fulfilled as a human being ... his hours have meaning , which make sense out of the ordinary and mundane . Apart from God , man seeks this satisfaction through intellectual pursuit , through the exciting of the emotions , and through the feeding of his body ... he will even seek it in religious exercise . But man will always be dissatisfied until he is responding to the love of the living God . Only in knowing God 's love will the rest of life make sense . As the forty years drew to a close and the land of promise again became the inheritance to be taken , Moses prayed this psalm . I find it fascinating that he should pray and ask God for a daily revelation of His love . Considering the awe with which the people held Moses . one would think he could have lectured them on the subject of lovingkindness and , by the knowledge they gained , they would live in it . But Moses knew better . God is the only one who can make known to us His love . We won't find it in a religious lecture or a formula which we can learn and use to manipulate Him . Nor is it in a beautiful poem to titillate our emotions and give us God feelings . It is God , himself , the Lover , who must open our eyes and satisfy us with His love . This prayer is man , in helplessness , asking God to make the love He is real in our hearts . Moses ' prayer was partially answered in the next generation and seen in the exploits of faith which worked by love in The Book of Judges . But it would not be answered in its fullest dimensions until the coming of the Holy Spirit , who pours out the love of God in our hearts ( Romans 5:5 ) . In the history of the early Church , we read of the Holy Spirit `` falling upon '' the believers . This is an ancient expression that , in modern English , means to give a bear hug . It is used in Luke 15 to describe the father running to the prodigal and `` falling on his neck and kissing him . '' The Holy Spirit is God hugging you in your deepest self and smothering you with divine kisses at the deepest level of your being . This is not a one-time experience to be filed in our spiritual resumes . Moses prayed that morning by morning we would awaken to the realization that we are loved . The world , and much of our religious training , has taught us to perform in order to be accepted . We have spent far too long living in a state of doing in order to find satisfaction for ourselves ... to find acceptance and love from others , and from God . We now come humbled to receive love we can not earn ... to be still and let Him tell us we are loved : to let the Holy Spirit descend into us , pouring out the love of God . We come in stillness to think on and repeat His words of love to our minds . which have been jaded with the doctrine of `` perform to be accepted . '' We begin to realize that He loves us as we are , and gives meaning and purpose to all of life . I challenge everyone reading this to begin each day , from the moment you open your eyes , by celebrating the God of love and praying this prayer . You may not feel anything , but SOMETHING ALWAYS HAPPENS . I was X-rayed the other day . I did not see or feel anything , but I noted that the technicians kept behind protective walls . They know you can not be exposed to those rays without being affected . So it is as we consciously begin our day knowing that we are loved . Such experiential knowledge will produce , according to Moses , `` joy and gladness all our days . '' Joy is the result of a life that is functioning as God intended us to function when He made us . You might say that joy is the hum of an engine that is at peak performance . Man ' s highest performance is to rest in the love God has for him ... the hum will be joy , and the result will be endless creativity arising from the sense of meaning he now has in life . Stop wandering in the wilderness . Be satisfied with His love and , in joy , day by day , receive all His promised blessings . -- -- - End Included Message -- -- -

I believe that Apple , Sun and a number of other desktop machine manufacturers have agreed with the government to incorporate power-saving techniques ; this is also something that governments in other countries are likely to require in the future , so expect to see it . This may include the ability for the system to fully power down the monitor , via a controllable power outlet , and power it back on automatically . ( Is this a `` sell '' on screen saver software companies ? ) Goals for `` idle '' power consumption have been set at something like 30 watts for the system , not including the monitor ( ? do n't quote me on this ) . Note that in many businesses , the savings will be substantial , especially if you factor in reduced load on air conditioning systems . Sun did a study that indicated that simply powering off monitors for the night would save the company ( Sun itself ) on the order of $ 1M per year . Putting other ( and automatic ) power-saving features in would probably have greater than double that value . Given that we are seeing more and more reason to leave our work and home computers on ( getting faxes , automatically getting email , ... ) , building power consumption control into all machines has a potential to cut ~2 % off the national power consumption , based on data I heard . BTW : when encouraging employees to power off monitors when leaving work , it was pointed out that this should only be done with monitors with the power switch on front . There was some indication that monitors with power switches on the rear are not designed to tolerate lots of power cycling . This may only apply to the monitors we use , but might be worth checking if you happen to have a monitor with the switch in back .

Burzynski 's work is not too promising . None of his A-1 through A-5 antineoplastons have been shown to have antineoplastic effects against experimental cancer . The NCI conducted tests of A-2 and A-5 against leukemia in mice , with the result that doses high enough to produce toxic effects in the mice were not effective in inhibiting the growth of the tumor or killing it . ( These were in 1983 and 1985 ) Burzynski claims that A-10 is the active factor common to all of A-1 and A-5 ( something which he has not shown , A-10 has only been extracted from A-2 . He also has n't shown that A-1 through A-5 are actually distinct substances ) . The NCI conducted a series of tests using A-10 against a standard panel of tumors that included different cell lines from tumors in the following classes : leukemia , non-small-cell and small-cell lung cancer , colon cancer , cancer of the central nervous system , melanoma , ovarian cancer and renal cancer . A-10 exhibited neither growth inhibition nor cytotoxicity at the dose levels tested . It is necessary to process A-10 since it is not soluble ( Burzynski's theory requires soluble agents ) , but this basically hydrolizes it to PAG ( which he calls AS 2.5 ) . PAG is not an information carrying peptide , something which Byrzynski claims is necessary for antineoplastic activity . AS 2.1 ( also derived from A-10 ) is a 4:1 mixture of PA and PAG . PA ( also not a peptide ) can be purchased at a chemical supply houses for about $ 0.09 a gram . A-10 is chemically extremely similar to glutithamide and thalidomide , both of which are habit forming and can cause peripheral neuropathy . The nasty effects of thalidomide are widely known . In spite of this similarity , A-10 does not appear to have been tested for it 's potential to induce teratogenicity or peripheral neuropathy . Many of Burzynski 's statements about the origin of his theory , early research , past and present support by others for his work have been shown to be untrue . sdb -- - sdb @ ssr.com

From : JEK @ cu.nih.gov Subject : Goedel 's ontological proof Lines : 22 Fred Gilham asks ( May 11 ) whether it is true that Kurt Goedel wrote a version of the ontological argument for the existence of God . Yes , he did . He did not publish it , but it will be published by the Oxford University Press in German and with English translation in Volume 3 , due to appear this fall , of his Collected Works . Meanwhile , you can find a summary , or perhaps the whole thing , in an article by Jordan Howard Sobel called `` Goedel 's ontological proof '' in the book ON BEING AND SAYING , edited by Judith Jarvis Thompson ( sp ? ) , published by the MIT Press in 1987 . Professor C Anthony Anderson of the Philosophy Department of the University of Minnesota has written an article , `` Some Emendations of Goedel 's Ontological Proof , '' which appeared in the magazine FAITH AND PHILOSOPHY , v. 7 ( 1990 ) : 291-303 . It discusses some objections that various critics have raised against Goedel 's proof , and offers a revised version of the proof that is not vulnerable to these objections . Yours , James Kiefer

As far as I can see if your obstetrition has an ultrasound in his rooms and is expirienced its use and interpretation , he should be just as capable of reading it as any radiologist . All doctors are `` qualified '' to read x-rays , u/s , ct scans etc . it is just that a radiologist does nothing else , and thus , is only better at reading them because of all this time spent doing this ( skill in reading x-rays etc . just comes from plenty of practice ) .

No , they are not guaranteed to become productive members of society . Even if they do that is *MANY YEARS* in the future -- until which they are a burden on someone , or society .

'' > That a person has a right to make a choice does not imply legally or > otherwise that someone else should Foot the Bill [ sic ] for that choice . Ok , look . It 's like this . We *are* footing the bill . Maybe they will take choice A . Maybe they will take choice B . Maybe they will take choice C. They ca n't afford any *one* of them . If they take choice A we 'd have to pay them , say $ 5 . If they take choice B it would cost us $ 20 . If they take choice C it will cost us $ 20 now and a hell of a lot more for the next 18 years . Which one sounds the most realistic for us to be willing to pay for ? Now some people happen not to like choice A . Other people happen not to like choice C ( paying for it , that is ) . C has been around and paid for for years . Even though it means we spend a lot of money , we ca n't in conscience refuse to pay for it . Now A has been around and is perfectly legal , but it has n't been funded in the past . Now A is going to be funded but some people object . They do n't like the idea of their tax money going to pay for choice A . So we could refuse to fund A at all . Then those women who ca n't afford any of those choices will be forced to take choice B or C , which will cost *all of us* more money . Most of us do n't see any reason at all why *more money* should be spent to the effect of *removing personal choice* from some women . The alternative is to fund A if that is what the mother chooses . We will also still fund B and even C if *that* is what the mother chooses . However , some women will certainly choose A , and that will then save us $ 15 we otherwise would have had to spend . Your '' taxes '' are not being raised to fund a choice you object , they are being *lowered* because we will fund a choice that is *legal* , despite your objections to it . ( Actually , your taxes are not really going to go down , as I 'm sure you would point out . But the amount that is saved in that area can help out in another -- like our massive debt . ) > > If you disagree then give us some `` reasons '' .

Look up the facts first , post second . Bernadotte was assassinated in September 1948 by Lehi under the orders of its three commanders ( one of whom was Yitzhak Shamir ) . There is no hard evidence of complicity of the Israeli government despite some effort by the UN and other organizations ( US intelligence , Swedish government ) to find it . However a great fuss was made over the apparent lack of zeal of the Israeli government to track down the killers .

It is my understanding that Roman Catholics believe that such declarations by the Pope are infallible . I see three possibilities : 1 ) The Church has received a Public Revelation since the death of ( for example ) Joan of Arc . 2 ) The Church was given a list before the death of St John which had Joan 's name on it . 3 ) There is no public revelation about Joan , and Roman Catholics are free to doubt that she died in a state of grace , or even that she is a historical character .

From : steve-b @ access.digex.com ( Steve Brinich ) Subject : How To Escrow , If Escrowing Were OK Organization : Express Access Online Communications , Greenbelt , MD USA Lines : 24 NNTP-Posting-Host : access.digex.net There is a description of something called a `` fair crypto system '' in the May 1993 issue of BYTE , p. 134 , attributed to MIT professor Silvio Micali . The way it works is as follows : You generate your private key S , and break it up into pieces s1 , s2 , s3 , s4 , and s5 , such that ( s1 + s2 + ... + s5 ) mod p = S. You give each piece s1 , s2 , etc . to a different escrow agency . The agencies each compute g^sn mod p , and forward the result to the public key telephone book keeper . The public key telephone book keeper multiplies all the g^sn mod p , reduces the result to mod p , and this will be the user 's public key . Now , if there were several hundered recognized escrow agencies , and the user could give a piece of the key to each of the ones he trusted , the result would be something of an improvement over the proposed Clipper system . I still do n't think key escrow is a good idea , for both philosophical and security reasons , but I do offer this suggestion simply to determine whether escrow advocates are at all interested in considering alternatives in good faith , or whether the goal is to insure the use of only two agencies selected for spinelessness in the face of official requests .

The fact is > that the Croat govt . using their secret police ( called the Ustache , I think ) > were the prime agents of the Nazis in Yugoslavia against the Serbs . > Actually , just after the FIRST world war , many Muslims were killed by Serbs . Under Serbian-led regime between the two world wars , many Croats were also killed ( especially during the dictatorship introduced on Jan. 6 , 1929 ) . Some Croats formed a resistance movement `` Ustashas '' ( Insurgents ) and were forced into exile , to fascist Italy , which sheltered them . In exile , they practiced a terrorist approach to liberating Croatia ; while Croats in Croatia followed the approach of peaceful negotiations under the leadership of Vladko Macek . After the Axis powers took control in the SECOND world war , Vladko Macek refused to collaborate , so Ustashas were brought in to run the newly formed puppet state . This state included both Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina , and its ideology saw Muslims as the best Croats ( `` flowers of Croatian people '' ) . Some Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina therefore joined Ustashas . However , even more others did not ; they joined Tito 's Partisans . The Ustashas membership peaked at less than 1 % of Croat and Muslim population of that area at that time . After WWII , Muslims were still considered a religious minority descended from Croats or Serbs who converted to Islam centuries ago . But , in 1968 , it was decided that forcing Muslims to declare their nationality as either Serbs or Croats is not a good policy . Dobrica Cosic , the current president of the rump Yugoslavia , was strongly opposed , and sought to prevent the category `` Muslim '' ( in an ethnic sense ) from appearing on the next census . He was criticized and expelled from the party . So , since that time , Bosnian Muslims are considered a separate nationality , although some still deny this and insist that they choose either Serb or Croat nationality . Sincerely , Josip

I'd > love to see how they manage to squeeze out so much from such > low volume : - ) Most commercial switchers do NOT use magnetics for their energy storage ; that 's handled by the big caps on the primary side , those which in a linearly-regulated power supply would be considered the `` filter '' caps , coming right after the bridge . The transformer is just that - a transformer . It 's there primarily to step the voltage up or down . ( Although the inductance seen by the switch transistor on the primary side is NOT negligible , as anyone who 's zapped said transistor from either failing to get one with a high enough breakdown voltage or neglecting to include a '' snubber '' diode across it would tell you . Actually , many transistors intended for switcher use today have the diode built in . ) The basic switched-mode power supply operates something like this ( in a somewhat simplified manner ) : The AC line is rectified to produce a high voltage , more-or-less unregulated DC rail . The energy storage ( or '' filter '' ) caps appear across this rail , as does the switching transistor . The transistor chops the current into the primary side of the transformer , resulting in stepped-up or stepped-down pulses out the secondary , which are then rectified and filtered . At least one of the transformer 's outputs is sampled and fed back to the control circuit for the switching transistor , which acts in a `` pulse-width modulation '' ( PWM ) fashion to control ( by varying the pulse width ) the amount of energy being dumped into the primary , and therefore the voltage coming out at the secondary . The remaining outputs may be allowed to simply run at whatever value they will , more-or-less tracking the regulated output , or they may have some additional linear regulation added . You may also note that the feedback between the regulated output and the PWM control ( which is most typically an IC ) is not done via a direct electrical connection ; this is due to various safety standards which require primary and secondary circuits to be electrically isolated . Often , the feedback path involves an optoisolator to meet this requirement . While the transformer is n't the primary energy-storage device in these designs , this does not mean that the energy stored in the transformer can be ignored ; besides the inductive `` kick '' giving the switch transistor a bad time ( as noted above ) , you also need to worry about getting all the energy that went *in* to the transformer back *out* again , one way or another . In some designs , this happens more or less automatically - but in others , you need to take special care to ensure that the transformer core doesn't saturate , which again would have disastrous results ( best left to the imagination ! : - ) ) . I 'm NOT by any stretch of the imagination a power-supply designer ; hopefully , a real one will come along soon and clean up any gross errors in the above .

Copyright 1993 , Information , Inc. , Bethesda , MD ================================================================= April 19 , 1993 ================================================================= `` Absence of HIV Transmission From an Infected Orthopedic Surgeon '' Journal of the American Medical Association ( 04/14/93 ) Vol . 269 , No . 14 , P. 1807 ( von Reyn , C. Fordham ) The risk of HIV transmission from an HIV-positive surgeon to patient is extremely low , provided that the surgeon strictly adheres to universal infection control procedures , write C. Fordham von Reyn et al . of the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon , N.H . The researchers contacted 2,317 former patients on whom an HIV-positive orthopedic surgeon performed invasive procedures between January 1 , 1978 and June 30 , 1992 . The orthopedic surgeon voluntarily withdrew from practice after testing positive for HIV . A total of 1,174 former patients underwent HIV testing , representing 50.7 percent of patients on whom the orthopedic surgeon performed invasive procedures during the 13.5-year period . Patients were tested from each year and from each category of invasive procedure . All patients were found to be negative for HIV by enzyme-linked-immunosorbent assay . Two former patients reported known HIV infection prior to surgery . The examination of AIDS case registries and vital records neglected to detect cases of HIV infection among former surgical patients . The estimated cost of the initial patient notification and testing was $ 158,000 , with the single most expensive activity being counseling and testing . This accounted for 37 percent of the total expense . The patient notification and testing were conducted while maintaining the confidentiality of the orthopedic surgeon who was an active participant in the planning and execution of the study . Notifying patients of the infected surgeon 's HIV-status is both disruptive and expensive and is not routinely recommended , the researchers conclude . \ ================================================================= '' Investigation of Potential HIV Transmission to the Patients of an HIV- Infected Surgeon '' Journal of the American Medical Association ( 04/14/93 ) Vol . HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 38 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 269 , No . 14 , P. 1795 ( Smith Rogers , Audrey et al . ) The risk of HIV transmission during surgery is so remote that it will be quantified only by gathering data from multiple , methodologically similar investigations , writes Audrey Smith Rogers et al . of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore , Md . The researchers identified a total of 1,131 persons in hospital databases who underwent invasive surgical procedures between 1984 and 1990 and for whom the HIV-positive surgeon was listed as the operating surgeon . The AIDS case registries were reviewed for all patients having undergone invasive procedures and death certificates were obtained . Among the 1,131 patients , 101 were dead , 119 had no address , 413 had test results known , and 498 did not respond to the questionnaire . No study patient name was found in reported AIDS case registries . One newly detected , HIV-positive patient was determined to have been most probably infected in 1985 during a transfusion . There was no HIV transmission in 369 person-hours of surgical exposure , suggesting that HIV transmission to patients is unlikely to occur more frequently than once per 1000 person-hours of surgical exposure . The researchers determined there is no evidence to suggest that the surgeon failed to adhere to standard infection-control guidelines ; over 50 percent of the patients with invasive procedures chose to be tested , and of those whose results were revealed , only one person was found to be infected with HIV . The study patient 's infection was probably the result of a tainted blood transfusion received in 1985 . As a result , there is no evidence that the transmission of HIV from the HIV-positive surgeon to any patient transpired , the researchers conclude . ================================================================== April 20 , 1993 ================================================================== `` Drug Concerns to Share AIDS Data '' New York Times ( 04/20/93 ) , P. C10 ( Kolata , Gina ) A total of 15 major pharmaceutical companies have decided , in a highly unusual move , to share AIDS drugs and information while the drugs are undergoing early clinical testing . Dr. Edward Scolnick , president of the Merck Research Laboratory in Rahway , N.J. , arranged the collaboration . He said that cooperation between companies seemed increasingly significant as it had become clear that combinations of drugs were likely to be more effective in fighting HIV than any drug used alone . The researchers are hopeful that HIV , when faced with a combination of several drugs requiring mutation at different sites for resistance to develop , will be unable to evolve all the mutations at the same time . Therefore , several drugs taken together or one after the other could halt the spread of HIV . Currently , the drug companies do not know what other drugs their competitors are developing . The new agreement allows companies to routinely exchange animal data and safety data on new AIDS drugs . `` An agreement like this will greatly facilitate HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 39 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 companies ' ability to choose the best drug combinations much faster and in a much more efficient way , '' said Scolnick . He also said that the collaboration would not violate antitrust laws . In creating the agreement , Merck spoke frequently to members of AIDS advocacy groups , including ACT-UP . Dr. Daniel Hoth , director of the division on AIDS at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease said , `` We 're delighted to see the pharmaceutical industry take this step because we think that increasing the information flow will likely accelerate the discovery of better compounds for AIDS . '' Related Stories : Wall Street Journal ( 04/20 ) P. B1 ; Philadelphia Inquirer ( 04/20 ) P. A3 ; USA Today ( 04/20 ) P. 1B ================================================================== '' The Next Step in AIDS Treatment '' Nature ( 04/08/93 ) Vol . 362 , No . 6420 , P. 493 ( Maddox , John ) Although AZT was found to be ineffective in prolonging the lives of people infected with HIV , the findings do not indicate that AZT should not be administered in people with full-blown AIDS , writes columnist John Maddox . AZT has been used in the United States in asymptomatic HIV-positive people on the basis that administration of the drug appeared to abate the decline of T-cell counts . However , a report in the Lancet demonstrated that AZT should not be used early in the course of disease . While the CD4 counts of the 877 people given AZT were consistently greater than those of patients receiving only placebo , the first three years of follow-up have shown that the proportions of people in the two groups progressing to overt AIDS or even to death were not significantly different at roughly 18 percent . The conclusions are that AZT is not an effective AIDS drug in HIV-infected individuals , and that CD4 cell count may not be a reliable proxy for the progression to AIDS in infected people . But nothing is implied by the study of the utility of AZT in the treatment of those in whom symptoms have already appeared -- there is no case for abandoning that treatment , at least on the evidence now available . It is much more alarming that the CD4 count has proven to be an unreliable mark of the efficacy of drug treatment in HIV infection . AIDS researchers should acknowledge HIV is alive from the beginning of infection and turn it into a workable assay of the progress of disease . The general application of such an assay will probably in itself provide a better understanding of the pathogenesis of AIDS , concludes Maddox . ================================================================== '' Infective and Anti-Infective Properties of Breastmilk From HIV-1-Infected Women '' Lancet ( 04/10/93 ) Vol . 341 , No . 8850 , P. 914 ( Van de Perre , Philippe et al . ) A vaccine preparation inducing a persistent immune response of the IgM type in the mother 's body fluids could be valuable to prevent transmission of HIV-1 from mother to child , write Philippe Van de Perre et al . of the HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 40 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 National AIDS Control Program in Kigali , Rwanda . The researchers hypothesized that transmission of HIV-1 through breastmilk could be favored by the presence of infected cells , by deficiency of anti-infective substances in breastmilk , or both factors . A total of 215 HIV-1-infected women were enrolled at delivery in Kigali , Rwanda ; milk samples were collected 15 days , 6 months , and 18 months post partum . HIV-1 IgG , secretory IgA , and IgM were assayed by western blot , for the latter two after removal of IgG with protein G. In the 15-day and 6-month samples , the researchers sought viral genome in milk cells by double polymerase chain reaction with three sets of primers ( gag , pol , and env ) . At 15 days , 6 months , and 18 months post partum , HIV-1 specific IgG was detected in 95 percent , 98 percent , and 97 percent of breastmilk samples ; IgA in 23 percent , 28 percent , and 41 percent ; and IgM in 66 percent , 78 percent , and 41 percent . In children who survived longer than 18 months the risk of infection was associated with lack of persistence of IgM and IgA in their mothers ' milk . The presence of HIV-1- infected cells in the milk 15 days post partum was strongly predictive of HIV-1 infection in the child by both univariate and multivariate analysis . The combination of HIV-1 infected cells in breastmilk and a defective IgM response was the strongest predictor of infection . IgM and IgA anti-HIV-1 in breastmilk may protect against postnatal transmission of HIV , the researchers conclude . ================================================================== April 21 , 1993 ================================================================== '' Firms to Share AIDS Research in Global Venture '' Journal of Commerce ( 04/21/93 ) , P. 7A A total of fifteen U.S. and European pharmaceutical companies announced Tuesday they will swap drug supplies and information on early-stage AIDS research to hasten the search for combination therapies to fight HIV infection and AIDS . The companies said the unusual move resulted primarily from the increasing concentration of AIDS research on combination therapies since realizing that HIV is likely to develop resistance to every individual AIDS drug . Edward Scolnick , president of Merck & Co. Research Laboratories , led the collaborative effort that took a year of negotiations to come together , said participants . In addition to Merck , the other companies involved in the Inter-Company Collaboration for AIDS Drug Development are Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. , Burroughs Wellcome , Glaxo Inc. , Hoffman-La Roche , Eli Lilly & Co. , Pfizer Inc. , Smithkline Beecham , AB Astra , Du Pont Merck , Syntex Inc. , Boehringer Ingelheim , Miles Inc. , and Sigma-Tau . The participants said that all companies involved in AIDS drug development they were aware of had joined the collaboration , and that any company actively involved in HIV anti-viral development may participate . Scolnick said the collaborators would most likely meet every couple of months for a daylong scientific meeting where they will review for one another their preclinical HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 41 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 and early clinical data . The American Foundation for AIDS Research ( AmFAR ) was pleased with the news of the collaboration , which it hopes will lead to the development of drug combinations that will reduce viral resistance .

Following recent highly publicized reports of health professionals who contracted HIV , the department issued revised guidelines on the management of such cases . Dr. Kenneth Calman , Chief Medical Officer , said doctors , dentists , nurses , and other health-care workers have an ethical duty to seek advice if they have been exposed to HIV infection , including , if appropriate , diagnostic HIV testing . He said , '' Infected health care workers should not perform invasive procedures that carry even a remote risk of exposing patients to the virus .

While the context of the time is important , value judgments must ultimately be according to current understanding , or at least to some base standard ( relative stability/success of a society , e.g. ) . This is obviously true in comparing it to practices of surrounding people , for instance : according to the Bible , the surrounding people were immoral savages with repulsive and inhuman habits . We need to look rather at what those peoples were *really* like . For instance , in what way is it better to worship a single god whose presence is symbolically strongest in a tent or temple over multiple gods some of whose presence is symbolically represented in a statue ? By the Bible 's own terms idolatry is inherently evil , but I see no evidence that the followers of the various other religions of the area and time were particularly bad people , relative to the people in the Bible . > [ ... scissors and cloth ... ] Now in the past , our ancestors > did cut cloth with scissors , but they at least knew that > their inhumane neighbors cut it with their bare teeth , > so this was a relatively enlightened step forward from > their earlier barbarism , and made the transition to > modern civilized paper-cutting that much easier . '' Sounds good , but it presupposes teeth-rending neighbors , which I see no support for . One can argue that post-facto assertion of inhumane neighbors can be used to make moral points , but that does n't mean that the actual neighbors really were inhuman . More to the point , such dehumanization of the people across the river or over the mountain , or even of a different people dwelling among us , is all too common . > | > That complex > | > and benign moral traditions have evolved based on particular mythic > | > interpretations of that history is interesting , but I still don't > | > think it fair to take that long tradition of interpretation and use it > | > to attack condemnation of the original history .

Well , I did a little research into Ka usage in this area and found out that Ka is not currently being used in this state as well as surrounding states . Here 's how I found out : - A cop friend who did spend time nailing speeders does n't even know what Ka is . He 's heard of K , which is what they use here and I explained that Ka is used for photo radar etc.. He then said , yeah , `` Ka stands for K automatic '' ... duuhh . He then went on to say that plans were being made for getting laser guns as far as going high tech were concerned , but he did n't know too much . - My 8 year old 2 band whistler was consistently going off at speed traps , even the real sneaky ones . - When I called the Escort Shop , they confirmed that Ka is not used here or in surrounding states . They did claim that Laser was being used a lot here , which I was quite skeptical of . So in the end , instead of spending a lot of money and/or waiting months for a state of the art detector , I got a low priced , high performance 2 band Escort 2200 . Incidentally its performance is equal to their top of the line model in X and K band detection . I know that Escort has been surpassed by other brands lately , but I 've never fully relied on a detector and I was convinced that the Escorts would be at least quite good , which was good enough for me and my wallet . eliot

Bosnian Muslims are slavic in ethnicity . They speak Serbo-Croatian . But there is a Christo-Slavic ideology whereby all true slavs are Christian and anyone who converted to Islam thereby must have changed ethnicity by changing religion . See the poems of Ngegos or the novels of Ivo Andric who brilliantly displays these attitudes on the part of what he calls '' the people '' ( i.e . Christian slavs ) . For this reason , the war-criminals call all the Bosnian Muslims `` Turks '' even though they are not ethnically Turk and do not speak Turkish as their first language . For this reason , what is actually a genocide labeled against those who are ethnically identical but religiously `` other '' is called , paradoxically , `` ethnic cleansing '' rather than `` religious cleansing . '' Thus , while a war rages between Serbs and Croats as a continuation of WWII , and older agenda , the annihilation of Islam and Muslims from Bosnian , is being carried out under the cover of the Serbo-Croat war .

The above conveniently ignores the murder of four BATF agents by the Branch Davidians in an unprovoked ambush . Any government that allows tinpot dictators to set up shop and declare a private state has drifted into anarchy . There are laws to control the ownership of guns and the BATF had good reason to beleive that they were being violated . They set out to obtain a legal warrant and attempted to serve it only to be met with gunfire when they rang the doorbell . The paranoid assertion that the BATF fired first in an unprovoked assault assumes that the BATF were on a death wish . Had they expected the B-D to be anything other than peacefull citizens who would accept a search authorized by a court they would have turned up in a tank and broken the door down on day one . The stupidity was the attempt to serve a warant on the place by ludicrously underarmed and unprotected police .

V.42bis , of course , is currently only *STANDARDIZED* for operation on top of V.42 ( in its primary mode of operation , LAPM ) , but that 's about as far as that goes . and just in case there 's some confusion on this , V.42/V.42bis are also supported by the Courier line ( unless you have a really ancient one ) . > The difference > with the Courier , is that it can run at 16.8 and only in the HST mode . take a second look at the original question : > In a previous article , cs3sd3ae @ maccs.mcmaster.ca ( Holly KS ) says : > > What is the difference between the US Robotics Courier v32bis external ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ see the V.32bis up there ? the question was not about the Courier HST modem , or about the Courier Dual Standard ... it was about the Courier V.32bis modem . the modem in question does not support HST , period . it therefore does not support the 16.8 kb HST . also , not all Courier HST / Courier Dual Standard modems support the 16.8 kb version of HST . my Dual Standard only supports HST at 14.4 kb . there are even older models that only run HST at 9.6 kb . > This is a proprietary mode of USR and it will only connect to another of > the same type unit to achieve this speed .

I do hope you did n't mean for these two sentences to be related in some way ... .. first off , V.32 and V.32bis are both synchronous and asynchronous . this is part of the CCITT Recommendation ( i.e. , part of the standard ) . it is n't a feature unique to the Sportster ( I just looked at the appropriate chapter in the Courier DS manual ) . second , HST is not `` one way only . '' more correctly put , it is an asymmetrical modulation scheme , meaning it does n't work at the same speed in both directions . HST operates at [ 9.6 / 14.4 / 16.8 ] in one direction , and has a low-speed back-channel in the other direction . the high-speed channel goes in the direction of the higher data flow . this is fine if you 're logged on to say , a BBS , and type one letter and get screens of info back , transfer files ( not using bimodem ) , etc ... . there is , of course , a penalty for turnaround time when the high-speed channel needs to reverse directions . V.32 and V.32bis are both symmetrical , meaning they do transfer the full data rate in both directions at the same time . third , synchronous vs asynchronous has absolutely nothing to do with symmetrical vs asymmetrical ... they are two completely different topics . > The HST 's will be upgradeable to the v.fast spec when it is available . again , more correctly put , *SOME* of the Courier line will be upgradeable to whatever `` V.fast '' is called when it 's complete . if you have the large footprint Courier modems ( like I do ) , you 're S.O.L ... .. there was an upgrade plan a while back to upgrade to a small footprint variety , which could eventually be upgraded to support V.fast , but the cost of the two upgrades together pretty much put it higher than just buying a new modem . later ... .. -- jim -- # include < std_disclaimer.h > 73 DE N5IAL ( /4 ) -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- INTERNET : jim @ n5ial.mythical.com | j.graham @ ieee.org ICBM : 30.23N 86.32W AMATEUR RADIO : n5ial @ w4zbb ( Ft.

From : hammerl @ acsu.buffalo.edu ( Valerie S. Hammerl ) Subject : Sabres/Bruins notes Organization : UB Lines : 57 Nntp-Posting-Host : lictor.acsu.buffalo.edu It was unlikely , improbable . For the Bruins , it was the stuff of nightmares ; for the Sabres , it was a taste of heaven . For the first time since 1983 , the Sabres have won the first three games of a series . Last time was a three games to none victory in a best of five against the Canadiens . It takes a little more work this time . The Sabres seem ready to put in the extra work . On the heels of a shutout , one that took away Boston 's home ice advantage , the Sabres came back with a four to three overtime win . It was n't easy . It was n't always pretty . It still worked . John Blue got the nod for Boston , supplanting Andy Moog as starting goaltender . Moog was pulled midway through game 2 on Tuesday . Buffalo started with a goal by Mogilny , his fourth of the playoffs , on the powerplay , with Boston 's Don Sweeney and Gord Roberts in the box . LaFontaine and Hawerchuk had the assists . Goal number two was Khmylev 's first of the playoffs , a pretty goal scored when the Sabres stole the puck and passed to an open and waiting Khmylev . Smehlik and Hannan assisted . Determined not to be shut out , Boston tallied on a shot by Ray Bourque on the powerplay , with Colin Patterson and Bob Sweeney both in the box . Period two was scoreless , a split of penalties between the two clubs . The third saw Boston 's Smolinski get his first , courtesy of Oates . Buffalo resecured the lead two minutes later , from former Bruin Bob Sweeney ( Khmylev and Carney ) . Neely tied the game 3/4 of the way through the third , sending it into overtime . Last year overtime meant a Bruin win . Last night , it spelled sweet revenge , as Buffalo scored with Ray Bourque in the penalty box , on a tip in by Khmylev ( Hawerchuk and LaFontaine ) a minute into overtime . Both teams finished with 34 shots . Power-play conversions -- Boston 5-1 . Buffalo 7-2 . Referee -- Rob Shick . Comments : Shick pocketed the whistle in the third , allowing a lot of clutching and grabbing . Buffalo 's penalty killing unit was fantastic again . Mogilny was checking . Granted he missed once and instead flung his body into the boards , but checking like this is a novel idea to Mogilny . The crowd was unbelievable . I do n't think I 've ever heard a crowd that loud in the Aud for a Sabres game ( remember , I was only five when they played for the cup . I do n't remember it and no one took me to the games ) . Doug Bodger , in a postgame interview , noted that he tried to say something to Hawerchuk , but the crowd was too loud , even though he was shouting . It did n't seem to matter , as most of the Sabres and even Muckler said it was great . Yuri Khmylev did n't seem to realize that he was the game 's third star and didn't skate out when his name was called . Sweeney ( 2 ) and Fuhr ( 1 ) each were out before Yuri made his appearance , sans jersey . When asked in an interview later whether he knew how big a goal that was , he responed yes ( ok , it was through an interpreter and he said more than that , even more than the interpreter said , but I digress ) . The interviewer seemed to think just because he does n't speak English , he must not understand playoffs . Uh-huh . -- Valerie Hammerl John Sr. would lift Pat over the boards , grab hammerl @ acsu.buffalo.edu his hand , and start running around the outside , V085PWPZ @ UBVMS.CC.BUFFALO.EDU faster and faster . `` I wanted to learn how to get that feeling , and the only way was to learn how to skate .

Rex , there are literally hundreds of thousands of 32nd degree Masons in this country , and thousands of 33rds . If nasty stuff was really going on , do n't you think you 'd have more than a couple of disgruntled members `` exposing '' it ? Heck , if what you say is true , then Rev . Norman Vincent Peale is an Osiris worshiper . [ ... Long quote from someone named Hislop ( source not given ) deleted . I'm attempting to extract from it the relevent points : * Osiris is actually Nimrod , a Babylonian Deity . * `` It is admitted that the secret system of Free Masonry was originally founded on the Mysteries of the Egyptian Isis , the goddess-mother , or wife of Osiris . '' * The Babylonian Nimrod and Osiris are both connected with the building trade , ie , with Masonry . * Nimrod , as the son of Cush , was a negro . [ is n't this refering to a Biblical Nimrod , rather than the Babylonian god ? ] * ... there was a tradition in Egypt , recorded by Plutarch , that 'Osiris was black ' . ... ] There is a long tradition in Masonry of claiming ancient lineage for the order , on the flimsiest of grounds . This dates right back to the Constitutions of 1738 , which cite Adam as the first Mason . I've seen other claims which place Masonry among the Romans , Greeks , and Egyptians , and Atlanteans . I even have a book which claims to prove that Stonehenge was originally a Masonic temple . Claims prove nothing . Where 's the beef , Rex ? [ ... Claims ex-Mason showed him leopard skin he wore in lodge ] > Any representation of Osiris usually show the wearing of some leopard . I 'd have to check this .

This whole `` leopard skin '' business sounds bizarre .

They threatened no one . Their neighbours thought they were a little strange but all in all the kind of people you would want to live next door to . One version has the BATF serving a *search* warrant by jumping out of a horse trailer with guns and tossing concussion grenades . If this is the true order of events then the 'cult ' could not know that a search warrant was being served and since there was no proof that these guys were police , the 'cult ' had every right to defend themselves . : Torching themselves shows briliant tactics , and convinces me : they *realy* belong in society ... If you watch actual footage of the fire from start to finish it is not at all clear that fire was n't started by the tanks . The people who survived are claiming that the fire was started by the tanks knocking over some kerosene lanterns . The FBI is claiming that the 'cult ' started the fire . 'they *realy* belong in society ' is a catchy phrase but I 'm personally waiting to see what the Texas Rangers have to say about it all before I pass judgment . Why do n't you do the same . Some more interesting facts about the Waco incident : 1 ) The original assault was conducted by BATF officers wearing an assorted types of camouflage . I saw , on CNN , at least three different types . I would be hard pressed to identify a bunch of guys in 'bring-your-own ' battle fatigues as uniformed officers of the law even if they were claiming to be police . 2 ) The BATF has been lying from the beginning : + `` We only had handguns '' - the original footage showed 4 BATF officers on a roof top getting shot at , one had an MP-5 assault sub-machine gun . + `` We were out gunned '' - sub-machine guns and shotguns are the BEST in quarters weapon , you ca n't be out gunned when you have the best guns available for the job . + `` We did n't know they had guns that would shoot through doors ! '' - this one is the best , there are very few guns that wo n't shoot through a household door , or through a house WALL for that matter . Since officers from the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , and *Firearms* should know that , they are either lying or incredibly incompetent . Not to mention criminally negligent if they are shooting bullets that they think will stop when the encounter plywood . + `` We had a search warrant . Actually , we had an arrest warrant . No , wait , we had both . Yeah , that 's the ticket . Oh , and they 're child molesters too . And they make *drugs* . Did we mention we think they have rocket launchers . '' - The story from BATF and FBI spokespeople has changed daily and their claims were getting increasingly outrageous . 3 ) Throughout the siege the FBI and BATF have be claiming that one of their biggest concerns was that Koresh and his followers would mass suicide . Now they are claiming that that 's what he did AND that they are surprised that he did . Huh ? All in all I think that anything the FBI and BATF say should be taken with a grain or two of salt .

Okay ... here 's some gripe '' ing '' ( ? griping ? ... whatever ) . ( I live in Santa Barbara ... for reference ... I think ) Okay , ABC showed the Kings/Flames ... fine ... YAWN . ESPN ( through a fortunate rainout of a baseball game ) showed the Red Wings/Toronto game ... cool . But I SWEAR that the advertisements all week long had said that ESPN would show Pitt/NJ on Tuesday and Bos/Buff on Thursday . I raced home from work early ( 4:30 Pacific ) to catch the game , but ALAS , it was the Boston/Buffalo game and then they promised that they would show the Pitt/NJ game on Thursday . OVERNIGHT they changed their mind . I did n't mind THAT MUCH . I watched the game ( hockey is MUCH better than NO hockey ) . During the game their were no video highlights from the Patrick division . What the hell was going on ? At least they should show video highlights of the other games ( especially the NYI/Caps game that was so close ) . My father ( lives in Bowling Green , Kentucky [ Bumbf*ck , Egypt ] ) got to watch the Pens game on ESPN . I just do n't get it . The biggest problem is that Buffalo or Boston fans who did n't want to see the Pittsburgh/New Jersey game 2 , will turn on their TVs on Thursday and see the Pittsburgh/New Jersey game 3 instead of the Buffalo/Boston game 3 . At least , in my case , I just had to wait 2 more days to see my game . If I were a big Boston or Buffalo fan and I missed the game on Tuesday due to false advertising on the part of ESPN , I 'd be mad as hell . Oh well ... hopefully we 'll get better coverage next year OR SOMETHING . Matt Coohill P.S . The announcers for the Buffalo/Boston were the worst that I have ever heard ( as far emotion goes ) . They had the enthusiasm of '' Droopy Dog '' . I hope for better on Thursday .

The criminal acts of the x-Soviet Armenian Government come directly under the scope of the Convention on Genocide adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 8 , 1948 , containing the following provisions : The Contracting Parties , having considered the declaration made by the General Assembly of the United Nations in its Resolution 95 ( 1 ) dated December 11 , 1946 , that genocide is a crime under international law , contrary to the spirit and aims of the United Nations and condemned by the civilized world ; Recognizing that in all periods of history genocide has inflicted great losses on humanity ; and Being convinced that , in order to liberate mankind from such odious scourge , international cooperation is required ; Members agree as hereinafter provided : Article 1 . The Contracting Parties confirm that genocide , whether committed in time of peace or in time of war , is a crime under international law which they undertake to prevent and to punish . Article 2 . In the present Convention genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy , in whole or in part , a national , ethnical , racial or religious group , as such : A ) Killing member of the group ; B ) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group ; C ) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part ; D ) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group ; E ) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group ; Article 3 . The following acts shall be punishable : a ) Genocide b ) Conspiracy to commit genocide c ) Direct and public incitement to commit genocide d ) Attempt to commit genocide . Article 4 . Persons committing genocide or any of the other acts enumerated in Article 3 shall be punished , whether they are constitutionally responsible rulers , public officials or private individuals . Had the Convention on Genocide existed before the Armenian massacres of the Turks and Kurds , it would probably have been difficult for the x-Soviet Armenian Government and its responsibles to start murdering of civilian , defenseless , faithful Ottoman citizens , children and women , ( GENOCIDE AND ATTEMPT TO GENOCIDE ) , to make plans to exterminate , as they have done also to Urartus and Jews , faithful Ottoman citizens ( CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT GENOCIDE ) , to incite Armenians to armed revolt against the legal authority and to commit Genocide , ( DIRECT AND PUBLIC INCITEMENT TO COMMIT GENOCIDE ) .

Exactly . Although this may be a dissapointing answer , there has to be an interplay of the two . Personal Ethos and Societal Morality .

Some say this , some say > that . > > How can the bulk of the people be informed , when they wo n't read > informative publications ? Because much of the public are n't even aware of the NAMES of informative publications . Look at the 'wealth ' of material on the typical newsstand . Unless the person is working in some kind of technical environment , with the usual trade journals , all they ever see is the media ( note : media in this context is the popular media - TV , radio , daily newspapers , and such publications as Time , Newsweek , and all that ) . And they all say pretty much the same thing . I see most of them being in the range of center-left to far Left , and generally supportive of pie-in-sky we-will-take- care-of-you-think-for-you-cradle-to-grave . There seems to be an air of arrogance that the individual is not capable of understanding major issues so the media does n't bother to inform them ( as with Clipper , for example ) or tells the people how to interpret events in others . What is lost sight of is that the people are not good at understanding things because they are not TOLD accurate information about them . It is a lot to expect of the people for them to be clarirvoyant . For example , I would have been unaware of Clipper had I not picked it up on USENET . How much of the population has USENET , let alone Internet access ? For access to better publications , the person has to spend time digging . Many folks , especially who work long hours , have families , etc. , do not have TIME to go digging , and many are not ( yet ) aware things are wrong , so are not motivated to dig . Not saying its right , just saying that is the way things are . People are n't upset about things when they aren't TOLD . And the less than objective media is a major contributer to the problem . And then compound that with an attitude of arrogance in the civil service ( bureaucrats , politicians ) that act as if the person without political connections , or deep pockets ( potential contributer ) should have few if any rights , being a resource to be used by those in control for their polticial or financial gain . Some Law Enforcement agencies act as if they regard the common person with a rather intense degree of contempt , peons that are supposed to do what they are TOLD , and get very nasty when someone questions them . The media pundits/editors , etc tend to fall into those with privilege , and tend to not be upset by the current state of affairs . The fellow in DC , who shot the swimmer in his Jacuzzi for daring to swim in it , with an ILLEGALLY owned gun ( violating the law he pushed to be foisted on everyone else ) , ends up walking where a less well-connected person would have been crucified . A typical example of one standard for 'us ' , a much more restrictive standard for 'other folk ' . Perhaps I am not real eloquent in expressing this , but the solution sure as hell is NOT to make it HARDER for people to find out what is going on , or dismiss their concerns because one happens to be in a position where one feels they are exempt or insulated . Such as that hypocrite of a journalist in DC described above . One notices that these less-than complimentary points about that double-standard was NOT covered in the media . I feel the reason was it dovetailed with their political views on the subject , and it involved a 'brother ' journalist . Is n't it time for our 'objective ' media , the MAIN SOURCE of info for the average person , to start being what they claim to be , instead of spin doctors for the Statist elements ? > -- > Rahul Dhesi < dhesi @ rahul.net > > also : dhesi @ cirrus.com -- pat @ rwing.uucp [ Without prejudice UCC 1-207 ] ( Pat Myrto ) Seattle , WA If all else fails , try : ... ! uunet ! pilchuck ! rwing ! pat WISDOM : `` Only two things are infinite ; the universe and human stupidity , and I am not sure about the former .

I think the answer to Mr. Mayamsky 's question can be found in the ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ( Mr. Mamaysky 's ) first amendment to the US Constitution . Amendment I ( 1791 ) Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances . Steve I do not say that freedom of speech should be banned . Far from it . I am merely suggesting that there are certain things which can be universally agreed to be morally incorrect . There are not many such things . But there are some . As an example : ( 1 ) murder is morally incorrect ( 2 ) the idea that one group of people is somehow racially inferior to another is morally incorrect etc . The point is that any action which serves to promote a morally incorrect action should be forbidden . This implies that no one has the right to say that an innocent person should be murdered . Regardless of freedom of speech , I may not stand on a street corner and advocate the murder of innocent people . The reason for this is that murder is a morally incorrect action . In the same way , since bigotry is morally incorrect in the narrow definition which we have given it , ( 2 ) , I , nor any one else , has the right to stand on a street corner and promote bigotry . Such an enforcement does in no way deny any one their rights as guaranteed by the first amendment . It merely ensures that no person may be the target of an attempt to deny him a fundamental moral right , such as the right to not be murdered , and the right not to be discriminated against . I believe , Mr. Berson , that to blindly accept the constitution is a terrific mistake . We must cinstantly question the constitution and interpret it in a way befitting the society in which we live . Anything short of such an effort would render us little more than trained monkeys , who are able to merely repeat what they have heard without paying the slightest bit of attention to the intent of the document in question . Would you disagree , Mr.Berson ? Harry .

Just in case the original poster was looking for a serious answer , I 'll supply one . Yes , even when steering no hands you do something quite similar to countersteering . Basically to turn left , you to a quick wiggle of the bike to the right first , causing a counteracting lean to occur to the left .

Tip is the GREEN wire of most standard phone lines . They two constitute the two wires most often used for voice telephone ( the two live lines ) . They are the two innermost connectors of an RJ-11 phone jack . Another way of telling is that if you measure voltage from RED to GREEN ( ring to tip . tip/green being at ground potential of the voltmeter ) , it should read -48 volts in the on-hook no-ring position ) . I am 98 % sure it 's -48 V and not +48 volts . Does n't hurt a phone too much if they 're reversed , it 's just bad if one happens to somehow get grounded to earth ground elsewhere ) . Additionally , when off-hook , the voltage drops to about -4 to -9 Volts DC . I think it is supposed to correspond to a 36 to 40 mA current loop . And lastly , when ringing , the two wires develop an AC potential of about 80 V p-p at 20 to 30 Hz across them ( where you get the electromechanical old fashioned bell ringer from ) .

By `` almost '' I mean the differential cryptanalysis attack . The chosen plaintext attack requires a detailed analysis of about 2^36 chosen plaintexts drawn from a total of about 2^47 that need to be run , if I understand the situation correctly . This is certainly a `` break '' under the meaning of the Act , but does not constitute much less work than the brute force keysearch . The rest of his article assumes that we can figure out the Skipjack encryption algorithm E by choosing the correct data to send through it and observe the results . I wish him joy of it , and choose not to try that attack . I am not defending the system , and in fact am offended by the ideas of escrowed keys or a secret algorithm becoming a de facto industry standard . However , I also object to opposing it for the wrong reasons , since that weakens the case against it . I said ( in my private e-mail ) : > > It 's not clear that the `` experts '' will be told F.

No , it 's quite different . The government would have no percentage in choosing F to be a weak key , since it 's not to their advantage to have anybody else know it . The `` experts '' could thus assume that F is no worse than anything else during their analysis . Totally different situation from unknown S-boxes . Again , I 'm not saying it would be good or satisfactory for the experts to just be given the raw algorithm without the rest of the surrounding details regarding the chip and protocols and so on -- simply that I doubt that they < would > be given all the information . -- Jim Gillogly Trewesday , 2 Thrimidge S.R . 1993 , 03:01

'' > > Serbs did not do that , although they supressed some rebellions > by Albanian Muslims and Bosnian Muslims quite bloodily . However , This is quite a misrepresentation . After WWI , many Bosnian Muslims were killed and their land taken over by Serbs , and the motive was plunder , not some fictitious `` supression of rebellion . '' Even earlier , one can point to the destruction of mosques in Serbia itself and expulsion of Muslims . Here is what Dr. Vaso Cubrilovic , political adviser to the Serbian monarchic regime , says in his memorandum `` The Expulsion of the Arnauts '' which he presented to the royal government of Stojadinovic on March 7 , 1937 , in Belgrade : The Mode of Removal -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - [ describes how expulsion of ethnic Albanians from Kosova is to proceed through state terror and `` private initiative '' , i.e . Chetnik plunder : ] Private initiative , too , can assist greatly in this direction . We should distribute weapons to our colonists , as need be . The old forms of Chetnik action should be organized and secretly assisted . [ ... ] ... the whole affair should be presented as a conflict between clans and , if need be , ascribed to economic reasons . Finally , local riots can be incited . These will be bloodily suppressed with the clans and the Chetniks , rather than the army . There remains one more means , WHICH SERBIA EMPLOYED WITH GREAT PRACTICAL EFFECT AFTER 1878 , that is , by secretly burning down Albanian villages and city quarters . ( Emphasis above is mine . ) These events in Serbia itself forced out virtually all Muslims during late 19th century . This policy of state terrorism against Muslims , aided by Chetnik `` private initiative , '' has continued in WWII and today . For example , Muhamed Hadzijahic in his book `` Od tradicije do identiteta : Geneza nacionalnog pitanja bosanskih Muslimana '' ( Sarajevo : Svjetlost , 1974 ) writes ( pg . 235 ) how Serbs killed a Muslim in Foca in WWII even though he claimed to be a Serbian patriot , explaining their action as follows : `` Inasmuch as you were a Serb , you sullied the Serb name , because you are a Turk [ i.e . Muslim ] . And since you helped us , we shall not torture you . '' so the shot him instead of cutting his throat . In the past year , Serbs have repeated the slaughter of Muslim residents of Foca . Destruction of mosques , including priceless historical monuments , completes the eradication of the Muslim presence from territories claimed by Serbs . > > I strongly dispute your notion that Croats had a similar older agenda , > > in fact , for the past century or two , Croats and Muslims have seen > > themselves as having a lot in common , and they generally had friendly > > relations .

Explain yourself , or withdraw your claim . > Croats from Croatia mostly had no contacts with Muslims , since they > were mostly `` dealt with extreme preudice '' long time ago . However > one of the main agendas is turning Bosnia into purely Catholic state . Croatia never had many Muslim citizens for historical reasons , because it was not a part of the Ottoman Empire . The last major battles between Austro-Hungarian monarchy and the Ottoman Empire in Croatia were at the end of the 17th century . Need I remind you that modern Croatian nationalism came into being with Dr. Ante Starcevic , who saw Bosnian Muslims as the best Croats , so much so that in 1853 he contemplated moving his operations to Sarajevo ? You are confusing clericalist Croatianism with Croatian nationalism here . Political nationalism has always been stronger . As for your other theories , you are clearly overjoyed that Croat-Muslim alliance in Bosnia-Herzegovina is now in trouble . Arguments such as yours are clearly intended to create and deepen this split . > I should add few more things . A.J . Evans , in his `` On Foot Through > B & H '' describes that Catholic clergy in the last century was > apparently more scared by Serbs , then by Turks , because Serbs were > growing stronger and , unlike Turks , represented great danger for > idea of Catholic Bosnia .

In international relations 101 you 'll learn that unless weak unite to counterbalance the strong player , soon they are taken over and that 's the end of them . Balance of power thinking has brought together Croats and Bosnian Muslims . This is only natural ; all other alignments are unstable . I 'm working on pointing out this basic fact : Croats and Muslims have been aware of it for as long as Serbia has existed . You are wrong if you think only `` image '' is at stake here . Croatia has a deep interest in her alliance with Bosnian Muslims , and vice versa . I think Tudjman understands this , although he does not have much choice at this point . Tensions should have been defused better earlier , before any open confrontation developed . Although I still think Croatia will survive , it will lose a lot ; but Bosnian Muslims may end up even worse off . However , their position now is so horrible that perhaps they do not see it getting any worse . The key point is : do they still have any hope left ? If not , then all bets are off . Mr. Stojanovic is clearly very , very happy about this . I 'm deeply hurt . This is not about some `` image '' but about survival of a concept of a partnership which I believe is natural and essential for both Croats and Muslims . Sigh ... Josip

Well , it beats a 32-bit design for thee sake of ellegance . 48 bit means 16 bits per primary colour . The 2^48 nr of colours is a bit misleading . It makes more sense to see it as 65536 possible shades of pure red . This might actually make some sense , since 256 shades of red ( 24 bit colours ) may produce visible 'jumps ' in intensity .

This brought to my mind a sermon I heard recently in which the speaker said `` God 's second name does not begin with a D '' referring , I believe , to use of God 's holy name and titles as swear words . I was also reminded of the experience of Moses at the burning bush when God told him `` Take off your sandals , for the place where you are standing is holy ground . '' These and other texts seem to imply that God 's people must treat holy things differently from other `` common '' things , or `` make a difference '' between holy and common things . The obvious questions are What makes something holy ? and How are Christians ( primarily ) supposed to make this difference between holy and common things ? ( e.g .

From : mcelwre @ cnsvax.uwec.edu Subject : The LAW of RETRIBUTION Organization : University of Wisconsin Eau Claire Lines : 89 The LAW of RETRIBUTION Violent crime , racism , bigotry , domestic abuse , rape , police brutality and oppression , human rights violations , etc. , ETC. , continue to get worse and worse in spite of more and more man-made laws on all levels from local ordinances to international law . The man-made laws are NOT working . `` WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS FAILURE TO COMMUNICATE ! '' Perpetrators remain IGNORANT of The LAW -- a universal , cosmic , and Spiritual Law -- The `` LAW of RETRIBUTION '' or `` KARMA '' : `` Be not deceived ; God is not mocked : for whatsoever a man soweth , that shall he also reap . '' Galatians 6:7 , KJV . `` He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity ; he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword . Here is the patience and faith of the saints . '' Revelation 13:10 , KJV . `` What goes around comes around . '' This LAW of the Universe is just as real as the physical law that for every action there is an equal and opposite REaction . It is the ENFORCEMENT , the TEETH , behind The `` GOLDEN RULE '' : `` Do unto others as you would have others do unto you . '' ALL perpetrators in the present will become VICTIMS in the future , most likely in a FUTURE INCARNATION . Most victims in the present were PERPETRATORS in the past , usually during a PREVIOUS LIFE . What is needed is a MASSIVE WORLDWIDE PROGRAM of EDUCATION to teach ALL present and potential perpetrators , in a convincing manner ( with sufficient supporting evidence ) , that what they do to others WILL BE DONE TO THEM , in this life or the next . Anyone who doubts the FACT of REINCARNATION , and the related `` LAW of Retribution '' , should read books such as `` HERE AND HEREAFTER '' , by Ruth Montgomery , which describes several kinds of evidence supporting REincarnation , including HYPNOTIC REGRESSION to past lives [ about 50 % accurate ; the subconscious mind can sometimes make things up , especially with a bad hypnotist ] , SPONTANEOUS RECALL ( especially by young children , some of whom can identify their most recent previous relatives , homes , possessions , etc . ) , DREAM RECALL of past life experiences , DEJA VU ( familiarity with a far off land while traveling there for the first time on vacation ) , the psychic readings of the late EDGAR CAYCE , and EVEN SUPPORTING STATEMENTS FROM THE CHRISTIAN BIBLE including Matthew 17:11-13 ( John the Baptist was the REINCARNATION of Elias . ) and John 9:1-2 ( How can a person POSSIBLY sin before he is born , unless he LIVED BEFORE ? ! ) . Strong INTERESTS , innate TALENTS , strong PHOBIAS , etc. , typically originate from a person 's PAST LIVES . For example , a strong fear of swimming in or traveling over water usually results from having DROWNED at the end of a PREVIOUS LIFE . And sometimes a person will take AN IMMEDIATE DISLIKE to another person being met for the first time in their PRESENT life , because of a bad encounter with him during a PREVIOUS INCARNATION . People would behave much better toward each other if they knew that their actions in the present will SURELY be reaped by them in the future , or in a FUTURE INCARNATION !

The classic comment on new encryption algorithms comes from Friedman : '' No new cypher is worth considering unless it comes from someone who has already broken a very hard one . '' Historically , Friedman has been right . It 's really hard to develop a good cypher . IBM 's Lucifer , the precursor to DES , turns out to have been fatally flawed . Most of the DES-like systems other than DES seem to be vulnerable to differential cryptanalysis . The first two tries at public key encryption ( remember knapsack cyphers ? ) were broken . Most if not all of the machine cyphers of the electromechanical era were broken eventually . Attempts in the computer era to home-brew encryption have been disappointing ; the classic `` A survey of data insecurity packages '' in Cryptologia contains analyses and breaking techniques for a few of the popular `` security packages '' of the late 1980s . A new , proprietary algorithm ? No way . If the US is permitting general export of this thing , it has to be weak ; that 's how the current regulations work . Currently there's a willingness to allow systems with short keys ( 32 bits appears to be no problem ; the 56 bits of DES are too many ) or weak algorithms ( I think Word Perfect qualifies under that rule ) to be exported . I ca n't believe these guys shepherded their technique through the PTO and the State Department 's Arms Control Division without finding that out . John Nagle p.s . No , I 'm not thrilled with Clipper either , but that 's a different issue .

From : stark @ dwovax.enet.dec.com ( Todd I. Stark ) Subject : Re : OCD Organization : Digital Equipment Corporation Lines : 60 NNTP-Posting-Host : DWOVAX Summary : Two important clarifications to previous post of mine ... This is to followup my previous reply on this topic , which it has been pointed out to me might have been dangerously misleading in two spots . 1 . I stated that psychotherapy ( meaning talking therapy and so on ) was used to treat Obsessive Compulsive Disorder , which though sometimes true is misleading . It is not often found effective , particularly by itself . Primary treatment today usually consists at least in part of drug therapy . The most current theories of this condition attribute it to more to biological causes than psychological , in places where this distinction becomes important . 2 . I mentioned that the DSM-IIIR mentions 'impulses ' as a possible diagnostic marker . However , this might look like something people associate with psychotic conditions , uncontrollable or unpredictable behaviors , which is NOT the case with OCD . One of the diagnostic criteria of OCD is that the individual can and does suppress some of their 'impulses , ' although they are an unending source of anxiety . The obsessive thoughts and ritualistic actions usually associated with OCD are most frequently very mundane and predictable , closer to a superstitious nature than a dangerous nature for the most part . Some references ( one non-technical and several technical ) that someone was kind enough to supply for me but was unable to post themself : | '' The boy who could n't stop washing '' by judith rapaport . *** ( technical refs ) : | pharmacotherapy of o-c disorder | donna m jermain and lynn crismon | pharmacotherapy 1990 ; 10 ( 3 ) :175-198 | epidemiology of ocd | seteven a rasmussen and jane eisen | j clin psychiatry 1990 ; 51 ( 2 , suppl . ) :10-13 | the waking nightmare : an overview of ocd | judith l rapoport | j clin psychiatry 1990 ; 51 ( 11 , suppl . ) :25-28 | absence of placebo response in ocd | matig r mavissakalian , bruce jones , stephen olson | j nerv ment disease 1990 vol 178 no . 4 And thanks very much to those who supplied constructive criticism to my first post on OCD .

Wrong , it had 128 bytes of RAM from the RIOT . This was multiply mapped into both page 0 ( pseudo-registers ) and page 1 ( stack ) , and also throughout the bottom 4K of memory . TIA registers also sat in this address space . As 128 bytes of RAM was somewhat limiting , some later cartridges also carried RAM themselves , which was interesting as Atari had provided no write line to the cart . This was managed by mapping the reads from RAM into one address range , and the writes into another , but all the time this scheme ate into the *very* scarce ROM address space . Ian .

The way you power things is with electricity , so the answer to the first question is definitely yes . ( If you meant to say `` propel '' rather than '' power '' , the answer is `` sort of '' . ) Yes , you can use interaction with the Earth 's magnetic field to get electrical power , and there are potential applications for this . However , bear in mind that there is no free lunch . The energy isn't coming from nowhere . What such systems do is convert some of the energy of your orbital velocity into electrical energy . There are cases where this is a useful tradeoff . Using power obtained in this way for propulsion is useful only in special situations , however . What you *can* do is get your power by some other means , e.g . solar arrays , and run the interaction with the magnetic field in reverse , pumping energy *into* the orbit rather than taking energy out of it . If you want more information , trying looking up `` electrodynamic propulsion '' , '' tether applications '' , and `` magsails '' . > Can the idea of a `` dragless '' satellite be used in part to create the > electrical field ? No . A `` dragless '' satellite does not magically have no drag ; it burns fuel constantly to fight drag , maintaining the exact orbit it would have *if* there was no drag .

There are *lots* of military targets in Israel . There are lots of legitamate targets in Israel . Old ladies , children , and civilians in general are not acceptable targets .

No , they killed soldiers so that the British government would leave . The objective was not to scare civilains , but show that the cost of staying was way too high . In contrast , a terrorist kills civilains to scare other civilains . They use random violence against people to make a point that no one is safe until their demands are met . An analogy would be the Irgun blowing up Harrods or 10 Downing . > Sounds like a form of terrorism to me , and not much removed from > Arab terrorism . Thats because you missed the essential point of arab terrorism , which is to scare civilains away from Israel , by killing those who have something to do with Israel . It is to kill Jews because they might be Zionists . It is to kill people who live in Israel because of where they live . The targets are rarely soldiers , or other people who understand they might be attacked in the line of duty , but innocent civilians , to underscore the message that no one who deals with Israel is safe . > I 'll reiterate again ... . both sides are screwy , but > I 'll favor the underdog in this case because I do think they > were a bit screwed .

Such nonsense do not belong in s.r.c and it really hurts me to read some of the posts on this issue . We chose to believe whetever we want , but we are not allowed to define our own Christianity . we see in parts . If you see something that I do not see , or vice versa , it does not give me the right to play jokes on your belief ! There is no wonder that your `` miracle '' does not work . You designet it yourself , and even if you were able to collect a group of people like the one you describe , I see no reason why your `` miracle '' should really happen . God is the one who does miracles , not humans ! After all we are all on the same way , or at least , we are all headed for the same goal , following different paths . Remember that we are going to spend eternity together . If I can not stand your view here on earth , how can I possibly stand spending eternity together with you ? Tongues is a question of belief . Not wether you believe in Jesus , but if you believe that He is able to give you this gift . Just as any other of the gifts mentioned in the Bible . But there is no evidence in the Bible that people who do not accept these gifts are in any way better than others . > Perhaps I would believe the `` gifted ones '' more if they were > glorifying God rather than themselves . Then perhaps we'd > witness a real miracle . Maybe some of the people who have received spiritual gifts are more interested in glorifying themselves than glorifying God , I do n't know . But if this is the case , it still does not suggest that the gifts are faked . In the Bible you will find that Jesus did not always do miracles . He said that `` I do nothing , except what my father tells me . '' Perhaps it woulkd be for the best of all if we where all able to live by that example !

But doctors who know of an HIV-positive colleague who has not sought advice must inform the employing authority and the appropriate professional regulatory body . The guidelines also emphasize the significance of notifying all patients on whom an invasive procedure has been done by an infected health-care worker . A model letter to patients who have come into contact with such an individual is provided , along with suggestions for health officials on how to deal with the media . In addition , a U.K. advisory panel on HIV infection in health-care workers has been formed to provide specific occupational recommendations to those treating such patients . ================================================================== '' Properties of an HIV 'Vaccine ' '' Nature ( 04/08/93 ) Vol . 362 , No . 6420 , P. 504 ( Volvovitz , Franklin and Smith , Gale ) The questions raised by Moore et al . about recombinant gp160 envelope glycoprotein precursor from HIV-1 produced by MicroGeneSys are advantages rather than disadvantages , write Franklin Volvovitz and Gale Smith of MicroGeneSys in Meriden , Conn. Moore et al . says that gp160 in a baculovirus expression system does not bind strongly to the CD4 receptor , and that this recombinant gp160 does not stimulate the same antibodies as the HIV-1 virus does in natural infection . But vaccination with recombinant gp160 in patients infected with HIV-1 broadens HIV-1 specific envelope-directed immune responses , including crossreactive antibodies to gp160 epitopes and CD4 and CD8 cytotoxic T-cell responses . Volvovitz and Smith claim that they never intended their gp160 molecule to be identical to the native protein . Antibody responses against native HIV-1 proteins , including the types described by Moore et al. , exist in nearly all AIDS patients but do not prevent HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 42 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 progression of HIV disease . In addition , the binding of gp120 or gp120- antibody complexes to CD4 has been shown to interfere with antigen specific activation of CD4 cells and trigger programmed cell death in vitro , which may contribute to the pathogenesis of HIV infection . The absence of CD4 binding by the MicroGeneSys gp160 vaccine may therefore be viewed as an added safety feature . Phase I studies have demonstrated stable CD4 counts , stimulation of cytotoxic T cells , and the suggestion of restoration of immune function . Based on these and other clinical results , MicroGeneSys gp160 was chosen by researchers at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden for the first phase III vaccine therapy studies , conclude Volvovitz and Smith . ================================================================== '' HIV-1 Infection : Breast Milk and HIV-1 Transmission '' Lancet ( 04/10/93 ) Vol . 341 , No . 8850 , P. 930 ( Mok , Jacqueline ) There are still more questions than answers regarding HIV-1-positive women breastfeeding their babies , writes Jacqueline Mok of the Lancet . The anti-infective properties of milk are well documented . While the numbers of leukocytes , concentrations of lactoferrin and IgA , and lymphocyte mitogenic activity decline sharply during the first two to three months of lactation to barely detectable levels , lactoferrin and IgA then increase from three to twelve months , with 90 percent of total IgA in milk being secretory IgA . Breastfeeding protects infants against gastrointestinal and respiratory illnesses , in both normal and uninfected children born to HIV-positive mothers . The Italian National Registry of AIDS discovered that breastfed HIV- 1 infected children had a longer median incubation time ( 19 months ) than bottlefed infants ( 9.7 months ) . Breastfed children also had a slower progression to AIDS . There is no agreement on which antibodies offer protection against HIV-1 infection . Studies of the biological properties of milk from 15 HIV-1 infected women showed the presence of IgG and IgA antibodies against envelope glycoproteins , as well as IgA antibodies against core antigens . Binding of HIV-1 to the CD4 receptor can be inhibited by a human milk factor . In the developing world , where infectious disease and malnutrition contribute significantly to infant mortality , breast milk is still the best food for infants , regardless of the mother 's HIV status . Transmission might be restricted by breastfeeding after colostrum and early milk have been expressed and discarded . The possibility remains that breast milk could protect the infant who is already infected with HIV at birth and may even delay progression to AIDS , concludes Mok . ================================================================== '' Absence of HIV Transmission From an Infected Dentist to His Patients '' Journal of the American Medical Association ( 04/14/93 ) Vol . 269 , No . 14 , P. 1802 ( Dickinson , Gordon M. et al . ) If universal precautions are practiced , the risk of HIV transmission from dentist to patient appears to be infinitesimal , write Gordon M. Dickinson HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 43 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 et al . of the University of Miami School of Medicine in Miami , Fla . The researchers contacted all patients treated by a dentist with AIDS and attempts were made to contact all patients for HIV testing . Living patients with newly detected HIV infection were interviewed , and DNA sequence analysis was performed to compare genetic relatedness of their HIV to that of the dentist . Death certificates were obtained for deceased patients , and the medical records of those with diagnoses suggestive of HIV disease or drug abuse and those dying under the age of 50 years were examined in detail . There were 1,192 patients who had undergone 9,267 procedures , of whom 124 were deceased . An examination of the death certificates of patients identified five who had died with HIV infection , all of whom were either homosexuals or IV-drug users . The researchers were able to detect 962 of the remaining 1,048 patients , and 900 agreed to be tested . HIV infection was reported in five of the 900 patients , including four who had clear evidence of risk factors for the disease . One patient who had only a single evaluation by the dentist denied high-risk behavior . Comparative DNA sequence analysis showed that the viruses from the dentists and these five patients were not closely related . The study suggests the potential for HIV transmission from a general dentist to his patients is minimal in a setting in which universal precautions are strictly observed , conclude Dickinson et al . ================================================================ April 22 , 1993 ================================================================ '' AIDS Patients are Susceptible to Recurrences of TB , Study Says '' Washington Post ( 04/22/93 ) , P. A13 Tuberculosis can strike AIDS patients more than once , which makes the resurging health hazard harder to control , according to a study published in today 's New England Journal of Medicine . People who contract TB usually develop an immunity that protects them if they are exposed to the bacteria again . But a person whose immune system is depleted may not be able to fight off a new TB infection , doctors found . Peter M. Small of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute at Stanford University , director of the study , said that in order to protect against reinfection , it may be necessary for some people to use TB medicines permanently . The study examined the genetic makeup of TB bacteria and how the germs changed over time in 17 patients at Kings County Hospital in New York . ================================================================ '' HIV-1 Infection : Breast Milk and HIV-1 Transmission '' Lancet ( 04/10/93 ) Vol . 341 , No . 8850 , P. 930 ( Mok , Jacqueline ) There are still more questions than answers regarding HIV-1-positive women breastfeeding their babies , writes Jacqueline Mok of the Lancet .

While the numbers of HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 44 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 leukocytes , concentrations of lactoferrin and IgA , and lymphocyte mitogenic activity decline sharply during the first two to three months of lactation to barely detectable levels , lactoferrin and IgA then increase from three to twelve months , with 90 percent of total IgA in milk being secretory IgA . Breastfeeding protects infants against gastrointestinal and respiratory illnesses , in both normal and uninfected children born to HIV-positive mothers . The Italian National Registry of AIDS discovered that breastfed HIV- 1 infected children had a longer median incubation time ( 19 months ) than bottlefed infants ( 9.7 months ) . Breastfed children also had a slower progression to AIDS . There is no agreement on which antibodies offer protection against HIV-1 infection . Studies of the biological properties of milk from 15 HIV-1 infected women showed the presence of IgG and IgA antibodies against envelope glycoproteins , as well as IgA antibodies against core antigens . Binding of HIV-1 to the CD4 receptor can be inhibited by a human milk factor . In the developing world , where infectious disease and malnutrition contribute significantly to infant mortality , breast milk is still the best food for infants , regardless of the mother 's HIV status . Transmission might be restricted by breastfeeding after colostrum and early milk have been expressed and discarded . The possibility remains that breast milk could protect the infant who is already infected with HIV at birth and may even delay progression to AIDS , concludes Mok . ================================================================ '' HIV and the Aetiology of AIDS '' Lancet ( 04/10/93 ) Vol . 341 , No . 8850 , P. 957 ( Duesberg , Peter ) Because there is no proof that HIV is the cause of AIDS , the hypothesis that drug use leads to AIDS will hopefully become a hindrance to the physiologically ( AZT ) and psychologically ( positive AIDS test ) toxic public health initiatives , writes Peter Duesberg of the University of California -- Berkeley . In the Lancet 's March 13 issue , Schechter et al . call Duesberg 's hypothesis that injected and orally used recreational drugs and AZT lead to AIDS , `` a hindrance to public health initiatives . '' However , their hypothesis that HIV is the cause of AIDS has not attained any public health benefits . The U.S. government spends $ 4 billion annually , but no vaccine , no therapy , no prevention , and no AIDS control have resulted from work on this hypothesis . Schechter et al . conclude that HIV has a key role in CD4 depletion and AIDS based on epidemiological correlations with antibodies against HIV and with self reported recreational drug use among homosexuals from Vancouver . However , their survey neglects to disprove Duesberg 's drug- AIDS hypothesis , because it does not provide controls -- i.e. , confirmed drug- free AIDS cases -- and because it does not quantify drug use and ignores AZT use altogether . To refute Duesberg 's hypothesis Schechter would have to produce a controlled study demonstrating that over a period of up to 10 years HIV-positive patients who use recreational drugs or AZT or both have the same AIDS risks as positives who do not do so . The 10 year period is claimed by HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 45 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 proponents of the HIV hypothesis to be the time needed for HIV to cause AIDS . Alternatively , they could show that HIV-free individuals who have used drugs for 10 years never get AIDS-defining illnesses , concludes Duesberg . ================================================================ '' Rapid Decline of CD4+ Cells After IFNa Treatment in HIV-1 Infection '' Lancet ( 04/10/93 ) Vol . 341 , No . 8850 , P. 959 ( Vento , Sandro et al . ) Interferon ( IFN ) , which induces autoantibodies and autoimmune diseases in some settings , may hasten CD4 T-cell loss in some HIV-1 infected individuals through the amplification of harmful `` autoimmune '' reactions , write Sandro Vento et al . of the A. Pugliese Hospital in Catanzaro , Italy . The researchers report three asymptomatic HIV-1 infected individuals with hepatitis C Virus related chronic active hepatitis ( CAH ) who had a rapid , profound decline of CD4 cells after IFN . All three patients throughout the observation were consistently negative for serum HIV p24 antigen and had circulating antibodies to p24 . Sera from all three patients , obtained at the end of IFN treatment and testing in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay , contained high titres of antibodies reacting to a sequence located in the aminoterminal of the beta chain of all human HLA class II antigens , homologous to a sequence located in the carboxy terminus of HIV-1 gp41 . These autoantibodies , which also recognize `` native '' class II molecules and may contribute to the elimination of CD4 T cells `` in vivo '' , were at low tires ( 50-100 ) in all three patients six months after stopping IFN . Such autoantibodies were not detected in 28 other patients with HIV infection and HCV related CAH treated with IFN and who did not experience CD4 T-cell loss in some HIV-1 infected individuals through the amplification of harmful '' autoimmune '' reactions . The subjects had A1 ; B8 ; DR3 ; and B35 , DR1 HLA antigen combinations which are linked with a more rapid fall in CD4 cell counts and clinical progression of HIV-1 disease . IFN can induce a very rapid decline of CD4 cells and should be used cautiously in patients with these HLA haplotypes , the researchers conclude . ================================================================ April 23 , 1993 ================================================================ '' TB Makes a Comeback '' State Government News ( 04/93 ) Vol . 36 , No . 4 , P. 6 ( Voit , William and Knapp , Elaine S. ) Although tuberculosis was once believed to be eliminated in the United States , it is emerging again among the homeless , AIDS patients , immigrants , minorities , and prisoners . Dr. Lee B. Reichman , professor of medicine at the University of New Jersey Medical School and president of the American Lung Association , said , `` Right now , it 's a big city problem , but potentially it 's everyone 's problem . '' The ALA predicts that 10 million Americans are infected with TB , and about 10 percent of them will develop the disease because their immune systems are depressed , especially those with AIDS or HIV . Gene HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 46 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 Tammes , a Centers for Disease Control expert , said that is why the CDC has issued guidelines warning hospitals and institutions not to mix AIDS with TB patients . State health officials believe the TB is also spreading because those who are most susceptible are the least likely to follow through with treatment . In addition , the increase is attributed to a shortage of public health services . In New York City , TB is an epidemic `` because the number of cases is increasing faster than we can treat people , '' said Dr. George Diferdinando , director of the New York State TB Control . According to Diferdinando , curbing the spread of TB entails keeping 85 percent or more of diagnosed TB cases in treatment . About 40 percent of infected New York City residents do n't complete therapy . When TB patients do n't finish taking their medication , multi-drug resistant TB can develop , which requires taking more expensive drugs and can take two years instead of the normal six months to treat . ================================================================ `` Increasing Frequency of Heterosexually Transmitted AIDS in Southern Florida : Artifact or Reality ? '' American Journal of Public Health ( 04/93 ) Vol . 83 , No . 4 , P. 571 ( Nwanyanwu , Okey C. et al . ) The alarmingly high rate of heterosexually acquired AIDS cases in southern Florida was partially related to misclassification of risk , write Okey C. Nwanyanwu et al . of the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta , Ga . The researchers investigated 168 such AIDS cases from Broward and coastal Palm Beach counties . All of these cases attributed to heterosexual transmission reported sexual contact with bisexual men , injecting drug users , or persons born in countries where heterosexual contact is the primary route of HIV transmission . Medical records of patients , in addition to records from social services , HIV counseling and testing centers , and sexually transmitted disease ( STD ) clinics were reviewed . If no other HIV risk factor was found from medical record review , patients were interviewed using a standardized questionnaire . Once STD clinic and other medical records were reviewed , 29 men and 7 women were reclassified into other HIV transmission categories . After adjustments were made for the reclassification , the percentage of AIDS cases reported from Palm Beach and Broward counties between January 1 , 1989 , and March 31 , 1990 , that was attributed to heterosexual transmission decreased from 10 percent to 6 percent among men and from 33 percent to 28 percent among women . While the percentage of heterosexually transmitted AIDS cases in southern Florida decreased after adjustment was made for reclassified cases , it still remained above the national average , the researchers conclude .

The purpose of copy protection is to discourage casual pirates ( `` Oh , can I have a copy of that ? `` / '' Sure , here . '' ) and the less sophisticated pirates ( `` Let 's look for all those calls to INT13H ... '' ) . Any one determined enough to break copy protection can and will succeed . They can always backtrace the entire load-sequence of the program . The point of copy protection is to make such attempts take as long as possible while not intruding upon the uses ( or to minimize such intrusion ) of legitimate use . Pirates who see copy protection as a challenge love breaking them , and no amount of copy protection will stop them , but the rest of us WILL be stopped . How many of these hardcore pirates are there compared to rest of us ? Not that many . -- Kasey Chang
From : maureen @ scicom.alphacdc.com ( Maureen Brucker ) Subject : Is this ethical ? Lines : 82 The following was published in the May 15th Rocky Mountain News . I guess I have some REAL ethical problems with the practices at this church . I understand that Baptism is an overriding factor . I also understand that this is not an honest way to proceed . Unfortunately , this is becoming more typical of congregations as the Second Coming is perceived to approach . There is a real element of disparation in this 'make it happen at any cost ' style of theology . I wonder where TRUST IN THE LORD fits into this equation ? Baptisms draw parents ' ire -- Children at church carnival in Springs told they 'd be killed by bee stings if they did n't submit to religious rite . By Dick Foster -- Rocky Mountain News Southern Bureau Colorado Springs -- Outraged parents say their children were lured to a church carnival and then baptixed without their permission by a Baptist minister . Doxens of children , some as young as 8 years old and unaccompanied by their parents , thought they were going to a carnival at the Cornerstone Baptist Church , where there would be a big water fight , free balloons , squirt guns and candy . Before that May 1 carnival was over , however , children were whisked into a room for religious instruction and told they should be baptized . In many cases they consented , although they or their families are not of the Baptist faith . The baptisms by the church have angered many parents , including Paulette Lamontagne , a Methodist and mother of twin 8-year-old girls who were baptized without her knowledge or consent . 'My understnading was they were going to a carnival . I feel that 's a false pretense , ' said Lamontagne . Her daughters said the minister told them they would be killed by bee stings if they were not baptized . Cornerstone church officials defended their actions . 'We take our instructions from the word of God and God has commanded us to baptize converts . No one can show me one passage in the Bible where it says that parental permission is required before a child is baptized , ' said Dan Irwin , associate pastor of the Cornerstone Baptist Church . Church officials did not tell parents their children would be baptized because 'they did n't ask , ' Irwin said . Many other parents also felt they were simply sending their children to a carnival at the invitation of their children 's friends who were members of the Cornerstone Church . Police said chhurch officials had broken on laws in baptizing the children , but indicated the parents could pursue civil action . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Are n't these the same behaviors we condemn in the Hari Krishnas and other cults ? [ I think the issues are more complex than the newspaper account mentions . First , I 'm not entirely sure that parental consent is absolutely required . This would be extremely difficult , because of the clear commandment to obey parents . But if an older child insisted on being baptized without their parents ' consent , I might be willing to do it . However this would be a serious step , and would warrant much careful discussion . The problem I find here is not so much parental consent as that there was nobody 's consent . Whether you believe in infant baptism or not , baptism is supposed to be the sign of entry into a Christian community . If there is n't a commitment from *somebody* , whether parent or child , and no intent to become part of the Church , the baptism appears to be a lie . Furthermore , it is likely to raise serious practical problems . What if the child is from a baptist tradition ? Normally when he reaches the age of decision , he would be expected to make a decision and be baptized . But he already has been , by a church claiming to be a Baptist church . So does he get rebaptized ? Neither answer is really very good . If not , he 's being robbed of an experience that should be very significant to his faith . -- clh ]
From : barring @ cs.washington.edu ( David Barrington ) Subject : Moe Berg Organization : Computer Science & Engineering , U. of Washington , Seattle Lines : 22 NPR this morning had an interview with Linda McCarthy ( name possibly garbled by me ) , an official historian for the CIA . She has won an Emmy for research on Moe Berg for a TV documentary ( which I know from nothing but which sounds good ) . She said that among other things , Berg was the principal spy for the OSS ( CIA 's WWII precursor ) spying on Axis atomic programs , because of his physics background and language skills . She said that during the war he met with Heisenberg in Switzerland , and had instructions to shoot Heisenberg if the Germans were close to us in bomb research ( he concluded they were two years behind , and did n't shoot him ) . ( I have heard elsewhere that Heisenberg deliberately misled the Nazi bomb program , but I do n't know how reliable this is . ) Unfortunately , NPR didn't mention any kind of a book she 's writing -- I 'd certainly buy it . ( In case you 're wondering about baseball relevance , Berg was a longtime MLB backup catcher . He was a member of an MLB All-Star team that toured Japan in 1934 , presumably not because of his baseball prowess but because he was one of the few Americans , much less MLB players , who spoke Japanese . Photos he took of Tokyo on that trip were later used to plan bombing raids , according to McCarthy . ) Dave MB

Pat , this would be slower , more expensive and worse . Slower : The shuttle mission is scheduled to go up in December . That 's less than eight months away . There is no way you could build new hardware , retrain and reschedule the EVA 's in that time . More Expensive : Your proposal still requires the shuttle to do everything it was going to do execpt fire the OMS . In addition , you 've added significant extra cost for a new piece of complex hardware . According to a GAO report on the OMV I have before me , there are only two currently planned missions that could use such a vehicle -- HST and AXAF . Since AXAF has since been scaled back and HST can rely on the shuttle , there does n't seem to be any need for your vehicle . -- Josh Hopkins jbh55289 @ uxa.cso.uiuc.edu `` Find a way or make one .

From : kstell @ cbnewsl.cb.att.com ( kevin.l.stell ) Subject : SQUIDS and Dealers Organization : AT & T Distribution : na Lines : 47 Yesterday , a friend had asked me to accompany him to a local motorcycle dealer . It has been a while since he last rode ( > 10 years ) , and I myself have never bought a new bike from a dealer . What follows is an experience of that visit and of an observation of `` SQUILDLY '' behavior by other customers and/or sales personel : BACKGROUND : I ride with a group of friends , who mainly are into `` cruiser '' type bikes . My friend was hell bent on getting an Intruder and had seen a few used ones . He wanted to see what the new ones were going for , so we happened upon a dealer that sold both Suzuki and Yamaha . The place was fairly busy , so we browsed a bit . We happened upon a few Intruders , most of which had SOLD signs on . My friend had been bitten . Well the salesdroid appeared and as my friend started chewing the fat , I moseid on outside . The next thing I know , I see 3 or 4 sport bikes pull in . I could stereo-type the type of riders ( backward ball hat , oakley , IQ < 40 ) , but I wo n't . Well they went inside , I did n't think much of it . I figured to each his own . I went back in to see if the salesdroid had his fangs firmly implanted into my friends back , when I noticed the `` hormone gang '' talking to other salesdroids/managers . Lot 's of laughter , jokes etc . No big deal . Here is the part that concerned me . The `` HG '' and those shop personel that were not busy with customers went back out , where said `` HG '' members fired up their rides and did the obligatory reving up of those 600 beasts . At this point , one decided to see how much rubber a Katana 600 could deposit in the drive . SQUIDS , I thought to myself . BUT I was appalled that the salesdroids/manager not only condoned this behavior , but encourged it , to the point were they were betting how long he could keep it up and egged him on to pull a wheely as he rode off onto a busy street around rush hour . THe girl that was riding pillion on another bike , seemed rather hormonal about this display , and urged her '' pilot '' to quickly catch up . The others followed , making sure there Kerkers could be heard as well as felt . I felt embarassed at this point to be a motorcyclist . I felt the eyes of those in cages , witnessing this display , then glancing over to the dealers lot and damning all those on two wheels . Needless to say , my friend felt a little uncomfortable and we left . I will now turn off my frustration and go ride ... peacefully , to clear my anger . I only hope that the cop who is following me home , has an open mind and does n't associate me with them . BTW , I ca n't afford a new bike ... ..

I guess that it was not acceptable because Germany *also* chose a path of aggression simultaneously that put the interests of other countries in peril . I wonder whether US or other countries would have risked themselves if only Jews were persecuted and Hitler had no imperialist ambitions . ( I am no student of history and I am just asking questions . ) If even for a moment you think that I am condoing ethnically motivated violence and killings , you are dead wrong . Let me assure I am not . My only question is this : Do powerful countries have a moral obligation to interefere in other countries if their own interests are not threatened . I cite an essay by Charles Krauthammer in the Time ( this week ) that discusses this issue eloquently . For example , did US and other European countries abandon their moral compunctions when they chose not to send military troops to Bombay when Hindus , in a rare fit of impassioned rage , killed many Muslims recently . I think not ! Under what conditions should US interfere in foregin countries , is an abstraction one must clarify before resorting to acrimonious accusations of religious bigotry and such .

I know this is kinda off the subject of sci.space , but not really , I want to answer this for their , as well as everyone else 's information . What these people are proposing , by and large already exists and can be purchased today . It is called labview by National Instruments . IT is a wonderful object oriented graphical programming language . IT has been implemented on both Mac 's PC 's and VME unix boxes . IT is fare superior to any programming approach that I have ever seen and allowed us to decrease the software development time for our shuttle payloads by 90 percent . This program is not dependendant on specific hardware and already has exensive analysis capability . Why re-invent the wheel on a platform that may not exist ? It is a great idea but look out there at what is available today . The Hydrogen leak on the Shuttle was found using this software . All SSME control and simulation studies , along with the real testing at MSFC is handled with LabVIEW . There are tons of applications , with the ability to create `` virtual '' instruments that can accomplish any specific custom task the maker desires . With the addition of IEEE-488 support , the computer becomes a virtual control station , allowing the graphic representation of remote instrumentation . With serial I/O support that instrument can be anywhere . The ground control software for the main control of SEDSAT 1 will utilize this approach . Dennis , University of Alabama in Huntsville

You want to dismiss us , and use the sleaziest means > you can think of to do so . I can see you have a revulsion for bestiality that far exceeds my distaste for homosexuality . Certainly if I spoke about homosexuality the way you speak of bestiality , nobody would have any trouble labelling me a homophobe . Let me ask this gently : why are you so judgemental of other people 's sexual preferences ? What happened to `` No doubt I am free to do anything '' ? I think you have a serious double standard here . When you describe a comparison between homosexuality and bestiality as `` slimey '' and `` sleazy '' , you are making an implicit judgement that bestiality is perverted , sinful , disgusting , unnatural -- in short , all the things that society once thought about homosexuality . Not all people share your view . You claim not to know any sincere zoophiles , but this does not mean that they do not exist . They even have their own newsgroup : alt.sex.bestiality . Are you going to accuse them all of being mere `` jokers '' ? I notice you deleted the main point of my comment : the fact that the only Biblical condemnations of bestiality occur in connection with the Levitical prohibitions against homosexuality . While there are some New Testament passages that can arguably be taken as condemning homosexuality , there are none that condemn bestiality . One of your main points seems to be that Christian homosexuality is acceptable due to the lack of any `` clear '' New Testament statements against it ; if this is a valid argument , then should not Christian zoophilia be made that much more acceptable by the fact that the New Testament makes no reference , clear or unclear , to the subject at all ? I am quite serious here . If I am going to accept homosexuality as Biblically acceptable on the basis of your arguments , then I am going to be fair and apply the same standards to everyone else 's declared sexual preferences as well . If the arguments you make for homosexuality can be applied to other sexual preferences as well , I 'm going to apply them and see what comes up . I 'm not trying to `` torpedo a serious issue '' by using what you label `` a ridiculous joke '' . I posted a question about how we should interpret Biblical guidelines for Christian sexuality , and I do n't think such a question is `` irrelevant '' in a group called `` soc.religion.christian '' . The Bible discusses homosexuality and bestiality together in the same context , and therefore I feel I have a good precedent for doing the same . > Jesus and Paul both expound , very explictly and in considerable length , > the central linch-pin of Christian moral thought : we are required to > love one another , and ALL else depends on that . Gay and lesbian Christ- > ians challenge you to address the issue on those terms -- and all we get > in return are cheap debate tricks attempting to side-track the issues . I do n't know whether it makes any difference , but for the record , this is not a side issue for me . I believe loving one another includes not encouraging people to defile themselves , therefore it is of high importance to determine whether God regards certain sexual acts as defiling . I can read in the New Testament that `` God has joined together '' heterosexual couples , and that the marriage bed is undefiled . I can read in the Old Testament that homosexual intercourse and bestiality defile a person whether or not that person is under the Law . If gay Christians can validly put aside the Old Testament standards of defilement , then I want to know so that I can fairly apply it to all the sexual practices that defiled a person in the old days . I do n't think it 's right to take just bits and pieces of the Law and try and apply them to Christians today , e.g . bestiality still defiles you but homosexuality does n't . That was pretty much what you said earlier , right ? You used different examples , but I think you said essentially the same thing about it being wrong to apply only certain parts of the Law to Christians . > Christians , no doubt very sincere ones , keep showing up here and in every > corner of USENET and the world , and ALL they ever do is spout these same > old verses ( which they obviously have never thought about , maybe never > even read ) , in TOTAL ignorance of the issues raised , slandering us with > the vilest charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can > manage to conjure up , tossing out red herrings with ( they suppose ) great > emotional force to cause readers to dismiss our witness without even > taking the trouble to find out what it is . It was not my intent to stir up such an emotional reaction . I personally do n't get all that upset discussing alternatives to the monogamous heterosexual orientation ; I 'm afraid I naively assumed that others would have a similar attitude . Please note that I have never intended to equate homosexuality with child abuse . I have merely noted that , for all the lack of `` clear '' NT condemnation of homosexuality , there is an even greater lack of NT condemnation ( or even mention ) of bestiality , a practice which a number of people ( e.g . on alt.sex.bestiality ) consider to be their true sexual orientation . > Such behavior should shame anyone who claims to have seen Truth in Christ . > WHY , for God 's precious sake , do you people quote irrelevant verses to > condemn people you do n't know and wo n't even take the trouble to LISTEN > to BEFORE you start your condemnations ? Is that loving your neighbor ? > God forbid ! Is THAT how you obey the repeated commands to NOT judge or > condemn others ? Christ and Paul spend ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE more time in > insisting on this than the half-dozen obscure words in Paul that you are > SO bloody ready to take as license to do what God tells you NOT to do . > > Why , for God 's sake ? > [ quote from John 3:17ff omitted for brevity ] This is an excellent question , and I pray that you will not treat it as a mere rhetorical question , but will genuinely seek to discover and understand the answer . I recommend you begin with a little introspection into why you yourself have much the same attitude towards zoophilia . Why do you find bestiality so repugnant that you regard it as slanderous to even mention in connection with other alternative sexual orientations ? Why do you not apply all the same verses about love and tolerance to zoophiles the way you apply them to homosexuals ? Is it because you automatically experience a subjective feeling of revulsion at the thought ? A lot of people have the same experience at the thought of homosexual intercourse . Is it because you regard the practice as socially unacceptable ? A lot of people regard homosexuality as socially unacceptable . Do you feel that it violates the traditional Judeo-Christian standard of sexual morality ? Many people feel that homosexuality does . Do you feel the Bible condemns it ? Many people think the Bible says more to condemn homosexuality than it does to condemn bestiality . Why then do you think comparing bestiality with homosexuality is insulting to homosexuality ? If you can honestly answer this question , you will have come a long way towards understanding why many people feel the same way about homosexuality as you feel about bestiality . Also please note that I am not in any sense condemning *people* . I am merely pointing out that when I read the Bible I see certain sexual *practices* that the Bible appears to condemn , e.g . sex outside of marriage . When I say I think adultery and pre-marital sex are sinful , do you take that as me failing to love my neighbor ? When you treat bestiality as something disgusting and unmentionable , are you disobeying `` repeated orders not to judge or condemn others '' ? When you say other Christians are guilty of sinning by condemning you and judging you , are you by that accusation making yourself guilty of the same offense ?

Siemon I say `` You are gods , sons of the > mls @ panix.com Most High , all of you ; nevertheless > - or - you shall die like men , and fall > mls @ ulysses.att..com like any prince . '' Psalm 82:6-7 I 'm not sure what you mean by the above two paragraphs . If you mean that Jesus is the Truth , and that He accepts sinners , and does not reject them , then I agree . If we were not sinners , then we would not *need* a Savior . Our salvation in Christ , however , does not mean that sin is now irrelevant for us , and we can now do whatever we want . Nor does Christ 's grace mean that those who refer to sin as `` sin '' are being judgemental or intolerant . I am speaking in general terms here , not specifically about homosexuality . If the Bible calls something `` sin '' , then it is not unreasonable for Christians to call it sin too . As applied to Christian homosexuality , I think the only definitive authority on Christian sexuality is the Bible . If you make a list of everything the Bible says on the subject of homosexual intercourse , I think you will find that every verse on the list is negative and condemning at worst , and `` unclear '' at best . The most pro-gay statement you could make about the list is that there is some dispute about the New Testament verses which many people interpret as condemning homosexual intercourse . That is , from a gay perspective , the most positive thing you can say about the Bible 's treatment of homosexuality is that some verses fail to clearly condemn it . That 's it . Jesus declared all foods clean , the council at Jerusalem declared that Gentiles were not required to keep the ritual Law , but nobody ever reclassified homosexual intercourse from being an abomination deserving of death to being an accepted Christian practice . You have verses describing homosexual intercourse as an abomination that defiles both Jews under the Law and Gentiles not under the Law , and you have some verses which are at best `` not clear '' but which some people believe *are* clear in their condemnation of homosexual behavior , and that 's the sum total of what the Bible says about same-sex intercourse . I can appreciate ( from personal experience ) your desire to have everything simple , cut-and-dried , black-and-white , what-I-want- is-ok , and those-who-oppose-me-are-wicked . However , I do not think the Bible makes your case as definitively as you would like it to . In fact , I do n't believe it says anything positive about your case at all . Yes , I know the verses about loving one another , and not judging one another , but that 's not really the issue , is it ? You know and admit that there are still things that are sinful for Christians to do , since you say it is wrong for Christians to condemn you . Therefore , the issue is whether the Bible says homosexual intercourse is a sin . Even if you do challenge the clarity of the New Testament verses , you are still left with the fact that the only thing the Bible does say clearly about homosexual intercourse is that it is an abomination that defiles both those who are under the law and those who are not . - Mark [ Actually I do n't think the reaction to the comparision with bestiality is based on bestialophobia . I think what he regards as slimey is the rhetorical approach of connecting homosexuality and bestiality . Most people who accept homosexuality take a radical approach to the Law . They regard all of Lev as not binding on Christians . The argument is that there 's no way in the text to separate bestiality , homosexuality , and wearing mixed fabrics . This does not mean that such people have no limits on their conduct , nor does it mean that they accept bestiality . It simply means that their sexual ethics does not come from the Law , and particularly not from Lev . -- clh ]

Chris Behanna is especially a squid . A squid is the guy I saw back in December on cool 40 degree morning on my way to work . He was wearing knee-length pants , light jacket , no gloves , though he was going considerably slower than DoD nominal . A POSER squid was the guy I saw yesterday on my way home . Similar attire as above sans jacket ( it is April in Texas ya know ) , but he is riding down the freeway , left hand on his side ( kinda Robinhoodlike ) , with his body turned slightly left .

You can spend a billion pretty quickly buying Titan launches . What 's more , if you buy Titans , the prize money is your entire return on investment .

From : barring @ cs.washington.edu ( David Barrington ) Subject : Mea Culpa -- Bosio no-no Organization : Computer Science & Engineering , U. of Washington , Seattle Lines : 46 Like Clinton and Reno , I accept full responsibility for this senseless disaster . My wife and I picked this game to go to and thus caused the return of the pre-season-projected Sox offense . Like all no-no 's Bosio was good , lucky ( hard grounder by Vaughn off T. Martinez ' glove but straight to Boone who threw to Bosio at first , 3-4-1 ) , and backed by good defense ( many non-trivial groundouts ) . The game was amazingly fast , as the Sox tended to go down quickly and Hesketh was also working fast . The Sox relief pitching was ok -- the runs off Quantrill were on two ridiculous bloops and a hard line single which Greenwell let get past him trying for a catch . Greenwell 's mental stability is a serious concern ( I guess it has always been , but his quirks were amusing back when he was an MVP candidate ) . Wednesday he got in a huff with Johnson a after striking out on a bad inside pitch ( apparently Johnson made an `` ok , I 've got to stay focused '' gesture which Iron Mike interpreted as taunting ) , and struck out to heavy booing the next two times . As Valentine noted , last night he came up in the first after Riles and Quintana had walked to open the game . Can you say `` take the first pitch '' ? Not Mike , who dribbled it into a 6-4-3 . The PI quoted Bosio that this was a `` batting practice fastball '' . Next time up he also hit the first pitch , a hard liner straight to KGJr in center . He also made the pathetic error and failed to catch Boone 's HR ( which looked comparable to the ball Lance Johnson caught on the highlight reel that night ) . Is Riles suppsoed to be good defensively ? I could n't tell from the field angle but his range looked bad , and he coughed a DP that cost a run or two . Why was he leadoff ? I hope Fletcher gets well soon . Also on lineups , Pinella put Bret Boone fifth for reasons beyond me . It seemed to work , as he was 3-4 with a HR and some good defense ( a wag behind us said `` He sure do n't want to go back to Calgary ! '' ) There is a theory that you put a leadoff type fifth because they 'll likely lead off the second ( as Boone did ) . Well , now we face the hot Angels and another power pitcher in Langston . A reminder that contest entries are open through next Wednesday -- I expect a surge of pessimism . By the way , ties will be broken by earliest entry . One entry per person or pseudonym , please , and easy on the pseudonyms . Dave MB

We only have the word of the FBI spokepeople that a survivor made this claim . We have the contradictory word of the lawyers who spoke with the survivors individually that ALL of them agreed that they did NOT have a suicide pact and did not intentionally start the fire . In the absense of any more evidence , I do n't see how we can decide who to believe . Furthermore , its quite possible that there was no general suicide pact and that some small inner circle took it upon themselves to kill everyone else .

This is a good reason to believe that the BD 's did . I will agree on your assessment as to the relative probabilities . Its more likely that the BD 's started the fire than did the FBI .

The fire was an started accidentally by the BDs . I am truely amazed that I have heard ( or read ) of no one suggesting this possibility . With all the tear gas and the lack of electical power in the compound and the adults wearing gas masks , it had to have been chaotic inside . I can easily image someone leaving a lamp too close to something or accidentally dropping a lamp or knocking one over .

No , I think that D is also quite reasonable . I personally ca n't really asses any relative probablities to either of these 3 probabilities although if forced to bet on the issue , I would probably take an accident ( either FBI or BD ) over intential setting of the fire ) . I would also like to add a comment related to the reports that bodies recovered had gunshot wounds . The coroner was on the Today Show this morning and categorically denied that they 've reach any such conclusions . He pointed out that under intense heat , sufficient pressure builds up in the head that can cause it to explode and that this can look very much like a massive gunshot wound to the head which is quite consisted with te reports I 've read and heard . In short , there 's been almost no evidence corroborating any of the many scenarios as to what happened on Monday .

There was an article in USA today a few months ago showing the results of a study that actually only about 1 % were homosexual . I saw another figure that listed 2 % as the figure . Of course , even if it were 99 % that would have little bearing on whether or not it is a sinful behavior . How many people have commited other acts of fornication ? How many people have lied or sinned in other ways ? > But in all fairness , the `` shameless '' nature of their acts is a > reflection of the general spiritual state of the people , and not a > specific feature of homosexuality . Why is n't it a specific feature of homosexuality ? Paul describes '' men with men working that which is unseemly '' to describe the acts . Sure , there spirtual nature was depraved also , and like the other sins , the idolatry , the other sexual immoraity , and the other sins sprang from their depraved spiritual state which was a result of man 's not glorifying God as God and being thankful . Still , their acts were shameless . > homosexuality or even considered it acceptable in some cases . On the > other hand , none of these passages contains explicit teachings on the > subject . Rom 1 is really about idolatry . It refers to homosexuality > in passing . Is everything sinful specifically elaborated on in the New Testament ? Scripture does not condemn being a drug dealer . Being ruled by the Spirit rather than the letter not only frees from legalism , it also protects us from sins that are against the Spirit . The word is a two edged sword that cuts both ways . I think we must be careful before we totally throw out Leviticus . If the Law is reflection of God 's character and true holy nature , then those who say that God endorses homosexuality run into a problem . If homosexuality were `` natural '' ( whatever that means ) wholesome , endorsed by God , and those who oppose sexual behavior are narrow-minded biggots , as some would have us believe , why is there a condemnation of it in Leviticus . This condemnation is in the midst of all the other sex sin condemnations , and there is nothing in the text to say that this law was limited to temple prostitution , and no good reason to believe that this was the case . Furthermore , male homosexual sex was a death-penalty crime ! Is every sin elaborated on in the New Testament ? Take a look at I Corinthians 5 . Paul said that one of the Corinthians had broken a law not even heard of among the Gentiles , that one should have his father's wife . There is a prohibition against having your father 's wife in Leviticus . No other new Testament verse clearly condemns it ( besides this one . ) Notice that Paul did not say that the sin was in commiting adultery , etc.- he spoke against having one 's father 's wife . Notice also that this sexual condemnation in Leviticus is not mentioned in the specific context of paganism either . And there was no pagan coustom mentioned in I corinthians either . As a matter of fact taking one 's father 's wife was n't even done among the Gentiles . It was just a plain blantant sin , whether worshipping idols was involved or not . > One commonly made claim is that Paul had simply never faced the kinds > of questions we are trying to deal with .

He had never faced the experience of Christians who try to act > '' straight '' and fail , and he had never faced Christians who are trying > to define a Christian homosexuality , which fits with general Christian > ideals of fidelity and of seeing sexuality as a mirror of the > relationship between God and man . It is unfair to take Paul's > judgement on homosexuality among idolaters and use it to make > judgements on these questions . One of the reasons that some of us do not accept that common argument is because Paul probably did face this and other problems . Sin can be tough to over come , especially without supernatural power . Is homosexual sin any more difficult to overcome that heterosexual sin , like lusting after a married woman , or sleeping around with people of the opposite sex ? I doubt it , and even if it is , that is no excuse . God is greater than all of it . Another reason we reject it is because it ignores the supernatural power of God to intervene in this kind of situation . How many people have been set free from sin by the power of God ? Sure there may be any groups that have tried to change homosexuals and failed . That is a reflection on the people involved in the program , and not God 's willingness and ability to change a sinner . Any program that uses formulas may fail . What people need is the power of God to change them , whether they are involved in homosexual sin , or any other sin . > I claim that the question of how to counsel homosexual Christians is > not entirely a theological issue , but also a pastoral one . Paul's > tendency , as we can see in issues such as eating meat and celebrating > holidays , is to be uncompromising on principle but in pastoral issues > to look very carefully at the good of the people involved , and to > avoid insisting on perfection when it would be personally damaging . > For example , while Paul clearly believed that it was acceptable to eat > meat , he wanted us to avoid pushing people into doing an action about > which they had personal qualms . I do n't see how you come to that conclusion . Paul 's dealings with pastorial issues encouraged people to give up their liberties in order to spare others- not to allow people to continue in sin because it was just too difficult . Take the example of eating meat offered to idols . Paul felt that there was nothing wrong , in an abstract sense , with eating the meat . Yet he advised believers to sacrifice their liberty to eat meat in order to spare others . But Paul never allowed people to sin because living holy was just to tough . Paul wrote to `` make no provision for the flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof . '' ( Romans 13:14 ) Then he goes in to a discourse on how we should sacrifice our own liberty in order to spare the consciences of others . Suppose it were not a sin for people to practice homosexual acts . Since others consider it to be a sin , then using Paul 's approach on pastorial issues , those who would otherwise be homosexuals should sacrifice their liberty and be celbate or monogamously married to a member of the opposite sex . Paul never offers a lesser sin ( homosexual '' marriage '' ) to prevent people from engaging in what may be considered a more damaging sin . > For another example , Paul obviously > would have preferred to see people ( at least in some circumstances ) > remain unmarried . Yet if they were unable to do so , he certainly > would rather see them married than in a state where they might be > tempted to fornication . Yet marriage itself is not a sin . marriage is holy in all- and something that God ordains , and Paul recognizes this . > Note that in the > creation story work enters human life as a result of sin . This > does n't mean that Christians can stop working when we are saved . Actually , Adam was put in the garden to tend to it before he fell . After he fell he would have to toil over the ground . > The dangers of trying to cure it are that the attempt most often > fails , and when it does , you end up with damage ranging from > psychological damage to suicide , as well as broken marriages when > attempts at living as a heterosexual fail . That is why we are dependent totally on God- what a vunerable and glorious position to be it . We all must be transformed by the renewing of our minds- and that is the only way homosexuals can walk in freedom , just like anyone else . > but I can well imagine Paul > preferring to see people in long-term , committed Christian > relationships than promiscuity . As with work -- which Genesis > suggests was n't part of God 's original ideal either -- I think such > relationships can still be a vehicle for people sharing God 's love > with each other . I 'm sure you can see how people with the opposing view see this conclusion . It 's like saying , `` How should I kill myself , with gun or aresenic ? What about the person who just is overcome with a desire to sleep with goats ? Would it be better for him to sleep with one goat , or all of them ? What about the person who wants to sleep with his aunts ? Would it be better for him to sleep with one aunt or all of them ? In all these cases , the more people or animals one sleeps with , the higher the chance that they will get a disease . But this only deals with physical aspects of the question . Whichever sin is commited , it all leads to spiritual death . > Cent . actions are the same . When Christian homosexuals say that their > relationships are different than the Greek homosexuality that Paul > would have been familiar with , this is exactly the same kind of > argument that is being made about judicial oaths and tax collectors . The issue that is most often addressed in Scripture seems to be the actual act . Second , is n't it historical snobbery to say that only homosexuals of this century are capable of having `` loving relationships ? '' There are ancient writings glorifying homosexual `` love . '' ( btw , I am one who believes in refraining from making oathes . Also , where do you get that tax collectors are sinners . That 's certainly not explicit . Jesus did n't tell Zachias to quit his job . ) Link Hudson . [ I 'm reluctant to comment in this in detail . Our basic concepts of the intention of Jesus and Paul are greatly different . As I indicated in the article , whatever the ambiguities of various words ( and I still think they are significant ) , it does seem clear that Paul considered the homosexuality he saw around him wrong . What you do with this fact depends upon your basic approach to the Bible . I 'm afraid that communication between legalist and anti-legalist Christians is even harder than between Protestants and Catholics in the 16th Cent . Since you disagree with my starting point , obviously you 're going to disagree with all of the intermediate discussion and conclusions . Sometimes discussion is still useful . I 've seen some very interesting work on Paul done by Jews . Obviously they do n't agree with him , but they sometimes have helpful insight into what he meant . But I don't see much sign for hope here . In talk.religion.misc there 's an axiom that by the time Hitler 's name is invoked , all hope for sensible discussion is gone . On this subject , when sleeping with goats is invoked , I do n't think there 's enough basis for understanding to be worth pursuing . -- clh ]

From : David.Anderman @ ofa123.fidonet.org Subject : Update - Back to the Moon bill X-Sender : newtout 0.08 Feb 23 1993 Lines : 51 Introducing the Back to the Moon in Congress : The Next Step The next key hurdle for the Lunar Resources Data Purchase Act is introduction of the Act in Congress . At this point , many congresspersons have been approached about the bill . However , for a successful effort to pass the bill , we need the best possible congressperson to introduce the bill . Due to his position as Chair of the House Committee on Space and Science , Congressman George Brown is the logical choice . He has a long record of support and interest in space development , and helped pass the Launch Services Purchase Act and the Space Settlements Act . There is a small group of activists in southern California who have assisted George Brown in his recent re-election campaigns . We are mobilizing this group to have them tell Congressman Brown about the Back to the Moon bill . We are also asking pro-space constituents to let him know that they care about getting America back to the Moon . Finally , there is a good chance that a nationwide alert for space activists to call or write George Brown to have him introduce the Back to the Moon bill may be staged during late spring , 1993 . All this should produce a positive reaction from Brown's office . As more is known , it will be passed on . However , even if we are successful in getting him to support the bill , this alone will not ensure passage of the bill . For any bill to become law , one of three conditions must exist : either the bill must reflect widespread national support for an issue ( such as extension of unemployment insurance benefits ) ; be propelled by high-priced lobbyists ( we 're out of luck there ) ; or have widespread support within Congress , due to small , but widespread , constituent support . The latter is the path that we , by necessity , must choose . This means that the introduction of the Lunar Resources Data Purchase Act must be immediately accompanied by a large number of congresspersons ' sponsorship of the bill . To accomplish this , we need activists to ask their congressperson to support the Lunar Resources Data Purchase Act - now . To wait until the bill is introduced is simply too late - it takes time to have a congressperson 's staff review a bill . If your congressperson mentions that the bill is not yet introduced , please elicit their opinion of the bill as currently written . We appreciate all comments on the bill from activists and politicians . If you have yet to see the Back to the Moon bill , please request a copy by Email ( please include your U.S. postal service address ) , or contact your local chapter of the National Space Society ) . -- - Maximus 2.01wb

Assoc. , Nazareth The Arab Association for Human Rights P.O . Box 215 Nazareth , 16101 Israel Phone ( 972 ) -6-561923 Fax ( 972 ) -6-564934 The Arab Association for Human Rights ( HRA ) was formed in 1988 to address discriminatory practices and human rights abuses by Israel against its Palestinian citizens . It is a unique association concerned with the civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights of the Palestinian national minority in Israel . Among the issues of concern are land confiscation , education , prison conditions , unemployment , torture and the unequal allocation of Israel 's resources . Today there are around 800,000 Palestinian Arabs living within the Green line ( the pre-1967 borders of Israel ) , constituting 18 % of Israel 's citizens . For them it is an empty citizenship in a system geared exclusively for the needs of the Jewish population . Legally and practically , Israel has proclaimed itself a Jewish state and early promises of equality for non-Jewish citizens have not been fulfilled . This is apparent in many areas strongly affecting the Palestinian national minority . Most Arab agricultural land has been confiscated since 1948 . The Arab sector is vastly underfunded and does not receive a fair share of state resources . On a day-to- day level , Palestinians face discrimination in many different forms and find it is a struggle to get permission to build a house , start a business , find a job or educate their children . ACTIVITIES - Monitoring civil , economic , cultural and human rights abuses of Palestinians within the Green Line . - Taking carefully selected test cases to court . - Providing legal advice and assistance to lawyers in the Occupied Territories . - Educating the Palestinian public as to their rights and methods of mobilization . - Conducting public campaigns on local and international levels . - Researching and publishing pertinent publications .

The key for Sabres 's win over Boston is whole team 's strong commitment > as an underdog and all their talent players including Mogilny and Fuhr . > I think that Grant Fuhr deserves more credit than that ! While it 's true that the entire Sabres team played very well , I still believe that if it was n't for Grant Fuhr , the series would now be tied 2-2 . He virtually stole games 1 and 3 for the Sabres . In both of these games , Fuhr stood on his head to give the Sabres the chance to win . Especially in game 3 , Fuhr made a series of huge stops in the third period when the score was tied 2-2 . Even in game 2 when the Sabres won 4-0 , the score seemed to indicate that the Sabres dominated . However , if it had n't been for Fuhr , the Sabres would n't have been up ( 2-0 I think it was ) through the 2nd period and the Bruins would n't have had to open up the game ( thereby allowing Mogilny to score the third goal on a breakaway to salt away the game ) . There is no doubt in my mind that Fuhr was the critical factor in the victory . In my opinion , Neely , Oates and Juneau played as well as LaFontaine , Mogilny and Hawerchuk . The Sabres did get extraordinary efforts from Hannan , Sweeney , Wood , and Khmylev ( compared to that of the Bruins checkers ) . However , the Bruins defense , IMO , played better than the Sabres defense ( the Sabres have Ken Sutton playing a regular shift afterall ; - ) The difference in the series was Fuhr , who outplayed Andy Moog .

My information shows that the last San Marco launch was 1988 . There seem to have been a total of seven before that . I seem to recall that someone , either ASI or the University of Rome ( ? ) includes money in their annual budget for maintainance of the platforms ( there are actually two ) .

A `` reasonable '' umpire would have realized that there was a 1-run game in progress , with two outs in the ninth . What Ron Gant did was try to regain his composure .

My point is that your implied position about the `` Waco Massacre '' is an assertion cum political position . According to a CNN poll , about 86 % of Americans think the FBI acted properly , and a majority think they should have done it ( the tear gas ) a lot sooner . A large majority also believe the FBI was not at all responsible for the death of the victims , Koresh was . ( Let 's avoid the kind of fruitless argument of the sort If A had n't X 'd , then B might not have Y 'd ... . ) What you call the `` Big Brother Chip '' is right now a proposal under discussion , and it is not yet clear that strong crypto is going to be banned . Therefore neither justifies `` any tactic is fair . '' Thus the statement is nonsense . It is pernicious , because `` any tactic '' can lead to damaging others .

PR material for the other three instruments > give accuracies on the order of `` fractions of a degree '' , if that 's > any help . But I believe that there is a fundamental difference here . The other x three instruments are focusing instruments , that , more or less , form an image , so positional errors are limited by craft attitude and the resolving power of the optics . BATSE is an altogether different beast , effectively just 8 coincidence counters , one on each corner of the craft . Positional information is triangulated from the differential signal arrival times at each of the detectors . Positional error would be predominantly determined by timing errors and errors in craft attitude . Since none of the 8 BASTE detectors have any independant angular resolution whatsoever , they can not be used to determine parallax . Indeed , parallax would just add a very small component to the positional error . Demonstrating that these puppies are beyond the oort cloud would require resolution on the order of arcseconds , since the oort cloud is postulated to extend to about 0.5 parsec ( all together now : `` Parallax ARc SECond '' , a parsec is the distance of an object that demonstrates one arc second of parallax with a 2 AU base line ) . If the 3 degree accuracy reported above is true , we 're going to have to add a BASTE to the pluto fast flyby to get enough baseline . The beauty of BASTE is that it both gives positional information and watches the entire sky simultaneously , a realy handy combination when you have no idea where the next burst is coming from . -Kevin

Congradulations tim . I think the other people answered you on most of the factual parts ( esp . about the internal conflicts policy ) . Israel very often gets away with more than most other nations ( Due to U.S. vetos ) . While I am not familiar with every instance I know that the reason Saudi Arabia was not condemned for killig the pilgrims was that the pilgrims were iranian . Yes , the UN is biased but mostly in favor of the US and its allies ( Including Israel , Saudi Arabia and Pakistan ) and against `` Outlaw '' countries like iran and more recently Iraq . Far be it from me to support the repressive governments there but I think they get more slack than Israel for things they do `` wrong '' . Again the reason some condemnations do n't occur lies in the race or country of the victims . The gassed Iraqi kurds got associated with Iran in the war and since Iran was perceived as worse than Iraq no condemnation resulted . The palestinians killed by arab countries involved another case of who cares . It seems that until very recently no one cared about how many palestinians died anywhere ( including in Israel and the occupied territories ) . Again I appreciate the lack of personal insults .

From : leo.wikholm @ compart.fi ( Leo Wikholm ) Distribution : world Organization : ComPart BBS , Helsinki-Finland , +358 0 506 3329 ( 20 lines V.32bis ) Lines : 44 A bright light phenomenon was observed in the Eastern Finland on April 21 . At 00.25 UT two people saw a bright , luminous pillar-shaped phenomenon in the low eastern horizont near Mikkeli . The head of the pillar was circular . The lower part was a little winding . It was like a monster they told . They were little frightened . Soon the yellowish pillar became enlarged . A bright spot like the Sun was appeared in the middle of the phenomenon . At last the light landed behind the nearby forest . Now there was only luminous trails in the sky which were visible till morning sunrise . The same phenomenon was observed also by Jaakko Kokkonen in Lappeenranta . At 00.26 UT he saw a luminous yellowish trail in the low northeastern horizont . The altitude of the trail was only about 3-4 degrees . Soon the trail began to grow taller . A loop was appeared in the head of the trail . It was like a spoon . This lasted only 10 seconds . Now the altitude was about five degress above horizont . He noted a bright spot at the upper stage of loop . The spot was at magnitude -2 . The loop became enlarged and the spot was now visible in the middle of the loop . A cartwheel-shaped trail was appeared round the bright spot . After a minute the spot disappeared and only fuzzy trails were only visible in the low horizont . Luminous trails were still visible at 01.45 UT in the morning sky . The phenomenon was caused by a Russian rocket . I do n't know if there were satellite launches in Plesetsk Cosmodrome near Arkhangelsk , but this may be a rocket experiment too . Since 1969 we have observed over 80 rocket phenomena in Finland . Most of these are rocket experiments ( military missile tests ? ) , barium experiments and other chemical releases . During these years we have observed 17 satellite launches .

I do n't even know what port is : used . : : Help me please ( at ke_kimmell @ vax.cns.muskingum.edu ) : : Kevin : : p.s . I 'm intending to use the cable for PC-to-PC transfers ( via Lap-Link or : Telix . Ideas and info gladly accepted . ) I do not have specific knowledge of Lap-Link or Telix , but my recommendation for ANY package is to follow each one 's instructions for making the null- modem cable . The reason is that each one may be different since there isn't really a standard for PC to PC communications . The following is a tutorial I wrote up that will give you an understanding about RS-232 and null modems , but you should still check your software ! I will eplain a couple of details of RS-232 . RS-232 is a commumications specification for communicating between a computer and a modem . Actually it can be between any end system and any communications hardware . The terminology used is Data Terminal Equipment ( DTE ) and DATA Communications Equipment ( DCE ) . RS-232 spells out the voltage levels , the connector type , the pinouts , and the signal protocols . The connector is a `` DB-25 '' but IBM has set an alternative `` standard '' of DB-9 . The primary signals are Transmit Data ( TD ) , Recieve Data ( RD ) , and Signal Ground ( SG ) . There are other signals that provide control between the DTE and the DCE . For example , the DTE announces that it is powered up and ready to participate in communications via the Data Terminal Ready ( DTR ) signal . DTR is an output on the DTE and an input on the DCE . Similarly , the DCE announces that it is ready to participate in communications via the Data Set Ready ( DSR ) signal . DSR is an input on the DTE and an output on the DCE . Ok that's five signals ; there are only four more of interest . The Request To Send ( RTS ) signal is an output from the DTE ( and an input to the DCE ) that is used to ask the DCE permission to send data . If the DCE agrees , it sends an ok via the Clear To Send ( CTS ) signal . ( For completeness , the CTS is an input to the DTE and an output from the DCE ) . The other two signals ( of interest ) are Ring Indicator ( RI ) and Data Carrier Detect ( DCD ) . These are both inputs to the DTE and outputs from the DCE . RI is just what you would expect - a signal to the DTE saying that someone is attempting to establish a connection to the DCE . This is rather specific to the modem / telephone line setup . DCD is a way for the DCE to announce that the `` connection '' has been established i.e . the local DCE is talking to some remote DCE . There - that 's it . Oh there are many other RS-232 signals defined , but they are obsolete . I have explained the nine signals that are on a PC . The pinouts are as follows : Name DB-9 DB-25 SG 5 7 TD 3 2 RD 2 3 DTR 4 20 DSR 6 6 DCD 1 8 RTS 7 4 CTS 8 5 RI 9 22 Now to address your problem at hand . When you connect a PC to a PC ( a DTE to a DTE ) , there is no DCE pair in the middle and therefore the RS-232 signal definitions do n't work out quite right . There is no DCE to assert the CTS , DSR , DCD , or RI . So the common thing to do is to not use these signals at all - and also forget about the DTR and RTS outputs as well . If this is done you simply make a null modem ( a cable ) that passes through SG , and crosses TD and RD ( i.e . pin 2 of one end connects to pin 3 at the other end , etc ) . The problem with this solution is that a PC that wants to send data has no way of knowing if the other PC is ready . It would have to just send the data and hope it got through . Therefore a better null modem would include the DTR/DSR pair crossed . A particular point a confusion is in the software area . Just because you run the wires does not mean that the soft- ware will use them . If you are using the built-in BIOS to control the serial port , then the BIOS dictates what wires you need and how they are to be used . But if you have a comm . package such as Brooklyn Bridge , or Lap- Link or Telix , then those packages dictate the cabling requirements . The only thing you can guess reliably is the SG , TD , and RD . The DTR/DSR is also fairly common . There is one more issue that needs to be addressed here . And that is flow control . In the RS-232 scenerio , the DCE 's are responsible for flow control and it is assumed that the DCE could n't possible over-run the DTE . By this I mean that as long as the DTE has its DTR line asserted , the DCE will send data - without requesting permission first . Note the contrast to the other direction of data flow : the DTE must request permission by asserting the RTS line and it must wait for the CTS signal before it can send . And now in the DTE to DTE scenerio , the question is do you need flow control ? The answser is usually . But how ? For non-binary communications , one common technique is XON - XOFF which is implemented in software - no wires are dedicated to flow control ; the TD and RD carry the XON and XOFF commands . This type of flow control can be used in addition to hardware flow control , but the problem is that you ca n't send binary data because your data might include the XON or XOFF codes and cause erroneous conrol signals . ( A work around is to have the software insert and extract `` escape '' codes , but the hardware flow control is prefered ) . The problem with hard- ware flow control is that there is no standard . There are lots of ways to do it and I bet they have all been tried . One cornerstone of all the methods is to use the RTS/CTS for one direction . But beyond that anything is fair game . Again , you must look to you comm package for cabling requirements . But I bet you 'll find that one cable ( if wired properly ) could work with all of the packages as long as they are of the same vintage . By the way , I am familiar with one package that uses RTS/CTS and DTR/DSR for flow control the RTS is request to send and the DTR is ready to recieve , the CTS is the clear to send and the DSR is the request to recieve . This does not mean a differnt cable - it is just software . The clincher to all of this cabling stuff is that it is common to have the UART directly controlled by the CTS signal which means that the CTS must be present even if you are not support- ing it in software . For these cases you will find cables that short the RTS to the CTS at the same end ( or perhaps the DTR to the CTS ) . Other possible shorting might be done just because the software expects certain signals that you do n't have ( or do n't feel like providing because it would mean additional wires ) . Specifically I am talking about the DSR . Shorting the DTR to the DSR is not a good idea in general but you may find cables like this . It is a bad idea because it defeats the whole purpose . One more '' gotcha '' signal is the DCD . Some software ( including the PC BIOS ) expects to see the DCD before it will work . This signal sometimes gets shorted with the DTR . But my favorite null modem has the RTS and CTS shorted at each end , but the RTS is also connected through to the other end and connected to DCD . And of course the DTR/DSR are crossed as are the TD/RD and of course the SG must pass through . This null modem works with most software . The flow control , if any , can use the RTS/DCD with the DTR/DSR . If your comm . package does not specify the cable required for PC to PC connection , then I suggest you use this one .

But it would clarify further if you would answer > from the point of view of any disinterested observers - perhaps an > observer as likely to be in position A as in position B ( where A and B > disagree ) in the future , and have his or her conclusion now binding on > them at that time . Well , if our observer X is as likely to be in A 's position as B 's , and if he agrees that both A and B are making appropriate observations and inferences regarding the situation , then I would expect him to conclude that there is no right answer . Hopefully there would be some other factor which would allow him to make some judgement regarding which answer to accept . If , on the other hand , he disagrees with the principles of either A or B , I suspect he would make a decision in favour of the other one . It is unfortunately the case that not all moral arguments have answers from all perspectives . For instance , I am completely unable to come to any conclusion regarding whether abortion should be allowed or not , from my perspective . In an ideal world , all living things would have a right to life ; but in an ideal world , women would have the absolute right to do what they like with their own bodies . Clearly there is no way to resolve in favour of both these principles . Therefore I agree with the compromise solution of allowing abortion up to a certain time after conception , and deciding on the time based on various ( sometimes ill-defined ) criteria . This is also a sensible move , I think , because it lets people make their own decisions ( within reason ) . And for what it 's worth , I am reasonably happy with current UK abortion law . Similarly , the situation in what 's left of Yugoslavia is a horrible mess , and I really ca n't see my way to any sort of conclusion . There , I do n't even know enough to imagine what sort of compromise one might manage . mathew

The types of cells that vitamin A regulates are the general epithelial cells and these cell types are not the ones that function in the ear hearing process . The hair cell nerve-like epithelial cells in the ear may respond to vitamin A during cellular differentiation ( embryogenesis ) but I do n't know if they are still capable of responding in adults . If they are capable of responding with new hair growth , this would be a very major breakthrough in hearing loss . With all of the medical interest in vitamin A , it would not be too surprising if a clinical study was done using vitamin A to reverse hearing loss . But with only a news announcement to go on ( and this type of communication is notoriously bad ) , I ca n't comment on your question anymore than I already have . If one study has been done , more will need to follow to firm up a link between vitamin A and hearing loss if there really is one . Marty B .

The story WAS > NOT filed frim Agdam but from London . I 'll let the rest of the net judge this on its own merits . Source : 'The Sunday Times , ' 1 March 1992 ( a British Weekly , written by Thomas Goltz , from Agdam , Azerbaijan . ) ARMENIAN SOLDIERS MASSACRE HUNDREDS OF FLEEING FAMILIES . The spiralling violence gripping the outer republics of the former Soviet Union gained new impetus yesterday with cold-blooded slaughter of hundreds of women and children in war-racked Nagorno-Karabakh . Survivors reported that Armenian soldiers shot and bayoneted more than 450 Azeris , many of them women and children , who were fleeing an attack on their town . Hundreds , possibly thousands , were missing and feared dead . The attackers killed most of the soldiers and volunteers defending the women and children . They then turned their guns on the terrified refugees . The few survivors later described what happened : '' That 's when the real slaughter began , '' said Azer Hajiev , one of three soldiers to survive . `` The Armenians just shot and shot . And then they came in and started carving up people with their bayonets and knives . '' `` They were shooting , shooting , shooting '' , echoed Rasia Aslanova , who arrived in Agdam with other women and children who made their way through Armenian lines . She said her husband , Kayun , and a son-in-law were killed in front of her . Her daughter was still missing . One boy who arrived in Agdam had an ear sliced off . The survivors said 2000 others , some of whom had fled separately , were still missing in the gruelling terrain ; many could perish from their wounds or the cold . By late yesterday , 479 deaths had been registered at the morgue in Agdam 's morgue , and 29 bodies had been buried in the cemetery . Of the seven corpses I saw awaiting burial , two were children and three were women , one shot through the chest at point blank range . Agdam hospital was a scene of carnage and terror . Doctors said they had 140 patients who escaped slaughter , most with bullet injuries or deep stab wounds . Nor were they safe in Agdam . On friday night rockets fell on the city which has a population of 150,000 , destroying several buildings and killing one person . Now wait , there is more . IT 'S INHUMANE TO IGNORE THIS VIOLENCE The stories of survivors of Karabag massacre : 69 year old Hatin Nine telling : - '' My Twin grandchildren were cut to pieces in front of my eyes . They told me : We wo n't kill you . But the babies have to die in front of your eyes . '' 72 year old Huseyin Ibrahimoglu : - `` Our Turkish village in Khojalu Town was blown up in two hours . While killing children and babies mercilessly they said : You are Turks , you must die . '' 28 year old Gulsum Huseyin : - `` They bayonetted my 3 year old daughter in her stomach in front of my eyes . '' Are these stories lies ? Have the eye-witnesses been day-dreaming ? Were these stories forged by Turkish journalists in the region ? The nonsense of such a claim is clear from the writings of British Journalists , too . Two days before we had quoted from a Sunday Times article . They [ British ] reported the events in Karabag even before Turkish journalists . What is more here are the pictures . Pictures of people who were bayonetted , whose eyes were gouged , ears cut off . Even the Armenian Radio could n't claim these `` lies . '' They are saying '' exaggeration . '' That means `` somethings '' have happened but the situation is not as bad as reported . Perhaps that village of Khojalu town was destroyed in 4 hours , instead of 2 ... Or Gulsum Huseyin's 3 year old daughter was bayonetted in her chest instead of stomach ... The massacre is clearly seen with all its dimensions . The effects of this massacre on Karabag and environs can not be reduced by any word . Some of the western press ' , led by some French Newspapers , ability to `` close their eyes '' is nothing but complicity in this massacre . Yesterday we gave samples from Le Figaro . Until yesterday 's print no news about the real events in Karabag were printed . So were the French TV channels.. The subject they considered related to Karabag was `` The necessity of protecting Armenians against Azeri attacks . '' The age we are living in is termed a human rights age . There are lots of organizations such as United Nations and CSCE ( Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe ) , and rules , all designed to fight against human rights violations . International reactions must be made with international cooperation . With support of everybody and every organization claiming to be civilized . Could there be a more serious human rights violation than that of the right to live -and with such levels of barbarity and cruelty- ? Where is the cooperation ? Where are the reactions ? And the intellectuals , journalists , writers , TV stations of certain western countries such as France who are fast to claim leadership of `` human rights ? '' Where are you ?

I would also like to know more about their past record etc . but again based on solid not media reports . My reason for asking for such evidence is that last night on Larry King Live a so-called `` cult-expert '' was interviewed from Australia who claimed that it was his evidence which led to the original raid . This admission , if true , raises the nasty possibility that the Government acted in good faith , which I believe they did , on faulty evidence . It also raises the possibility that other self proclaimed cult experts were advising them and giving ver poor advice . A few years ago Anson Shupe and David Bromley published STRANGE GODS : THE GREAT AMERICAN CULT SCARE ( Beacon , Boston , 1981 - and THE NEW VIGILANTES : ANTI-CULTISTS AND NEW RELIGIONS -Sage , Beverly Hills , 1980 . Both books suggested the possibility of tragic results if self-proclaimed cult experts were ever taken seriously . Perhaps their diagnosis of the anit-cult movement needs investigating in light of the Waco tragedy .

This is not at all comparable . Christianity is the main stream in western culture . You are trivializing the experiences of others . I remember what it was like being `` different '' as a Christian . We were told all the time that we were different , and in fact that only members of the our church were really Christians ( though others who believed in God were n't as bad as atheists ) , so we were a small minority . That was nothing compared to being an atheist . The only thing comparable would be a young child being Christian being surrounded by staunch atheists , including parents , who actively persecute any religious tendancies - both actual punishments and , even worse , emotional blackmail . They would also have to have the whole mainstream society on their side . Maybe these conditions could have occured in the old Soviet Union* not in a country with `` under God '' in its pledge of allegiance . * I doubt it even then , because children have to be taught to be Christians and hence must have support somewhere . > > I have sympathy for gays growing up in repressive environments and > > having to hide and sometimes at first try to deny a part of themselves > > because I 've been there .

[ please , no flames about whether or > not gay people `` choose '' their lifestyle -- that 's elsewhere in this > newsgroup ] Yes . My atheism was `` born of necessity . '' For an intellectually honest person belief is mostly a response to evidence . Will or wishes have nothing to do with it . I could choose to lie , or to be silent about my true beliefs . I could no more choose to believe in the God of Christianity than I could decide that the ordinary sky looks red to me . Still I should be clear that I 'm not equating what I went through with what gays go through . However it is a mistake to assume that everyone who goes through painful experiences are broken by them . Happily some are made stronger , once we get past it . > > I must say that I > > was n't hurt by my experiences in church any more than some of my friends > > who did n't become atheists . I was just hurt differently . > > i 'm not sure i understand this sentence -- could you explain ? Not without going to details and violating the confidences of some of my childhood friends . Suffice it say to that religion does not guarantee that a person will be happy and strong emotionally , and a repressive upbringing can leave its scars even , or especially , on those who don't get free of it . I doubt that any sane and sincere person doubts that and I feel no need to defend it . By the way I am much happier and stronger being out of the closet . In the end it has been , as someone eloquently put it in private email , an experience of liberation rather than disillusion . Bill Mayne

True , which is why many of the newer keys ship out , oh , maybe 32 bits or so , have the key encrypt them , and return them to the PC .

It makes little difference if you have eyewitnesses or people one step away ( reporters , if you will ) . As I said earlier , the `` telephone '' metaphor is innately bad , because the purpose of a game of telephone is contrary to the aims of writing these sorts of texts . ( Also , I would point out that , by the standards generally asserted in this group , the distinction between eyewitnesses and others is hollow , since nobody can be shown to be an eyewitness , or indeed , even shown to be the author of the text . ) There is no evidence that the `` original '' texts of either the OT or the NT are largely lost over time in a sea of errors , `` corrections '' , additions and deletions . In the case of the NT , the evidence is strongly in the other direction : the Textus R. and the Nestle-Aland text do not differ on more than a low level of significance .

I have an appl . which uses 1 window to draw in . Since I give the user the capability of scaling and zooming as well as allowing the window to be resized , I made a translation table for the Expose & Configure events . The Expose event calls my redraw method while the Configure event calls my rescale method . The rescale method invokes a `` fake '' Expose event ( actually just calls the redraw w/ an appropriate Expose struct ) to draw the data . Quest 1 . When the appl . is compiled/linked w/ R4 ( running in either R4 or R5 env . ) I get multiple ( > 4 ) redraws when the window gets uncovered or the size is changed . I assume I 'm getting cascading events . Is that right ? Any suggestions as to how to handle/trap events in a better way ? Quest 2 .

This is not arrogance -- > it is just an inescapable fact . Yes , there are these two senses of interpretation , and certainly our decision to accept Scripture as inspired ultimately rests on our own private opinion . However , when reading Scripture , we have to remember that the Scriptures were given by God for our instruction , and that the interpretation that matters is the one God intended . For example , if I decide that the fact that John the Baptist is Elijah teaches the doctrine of reincarnation , I am wrong because that is not the intended interpretation . The prophets did n't make up this teaching ; it came from God , and we must accept it as such . This necessarily means that our private interpretations must take a back seat to the meaning God intended to convey . Certainly we must rely on our best efforts to determine what this meaning is , but this very fact should make us recognize that our private interpretations can not be automatically accepted as the infallible interpretation of God . We need to test the spirits to see if they are from God . When the Holy Spirit speaks , he says the same thing to all ; he wo n't tell me that a passage means one thing and tell you it means another . If the two of us come to conflicting conclusions , we ca n't both be completely right . We know our interpretations are reliable only when the Church as a whole agrees on what Scripture means . This is how we know the doctrines of the Trinity , the dual nature of Christ , etc . infallibly . These matters are not up for private interpretation . This is the reason Peter goes on to talk about the deceptiveness of the false teachers . They preferred their own private interpretation to the God-given teaching of the apostles . It is through such private interpretation that the traditions of men , so soundly denounced in Scripture , are started . Tony

The only way you can use a gun is to hurt somebody else . Crypto- graphy helps prevent other people from hurting you . Sorry for the digression .

Either A : God exists , or B : He does n't . We have two choices , either 1 : Believe in God , or 2 : Do n't believe in God .

Such things are derived from Biblcal texts through the centuries by the apocolic fathers of the faith . You are right that people read things differently in the Bible , and this is alright in parts like parables and such forth . However , when it comes to the essential doctrines of the Historical Orthodox Christan Beliefs , there is only one correct way to read it . For example , either the doctrine of the Trinity is true , or it is false . Yes , people read the texts differently , but only one position is true . They both can not be . According to the text , the doctrine is true and has always existed . Therefore , when people like Joseph Smith come along with a vision and thinks he can undo centuries of a doctrine that is supported by the Bible , people consider him a cult .

Of course no set of circumstances can be inconsistent with supernaturalism , but similarly , no set of circumstances can be inconsistent with naturalism .

Actually , both numbers are correct . The difference is in the direction of the acceleration . For pilots , accelerations tend to be transverse to the direction you 're facing ( pulling out from a steep dive , the acceleration will force blood toward your feet , for instance ) . In this case , you can only put up with about 8 g 's even with a pressure suit . The record for acceleration , though , is measured along `` the direction you 're facing '' ( for lack of a better term ) . As I recall , this record was set in rocket sleds back in the 60 's -- and was about 40 g 's or so . Eric Seale seale @ pogo.den.mmc.com

In fact , I do n't remember _ever_ crashing . Of course , I really do n't run any OS/2 programs , just the same bunch of DOS and Windows stuff that I 've always been running . And when I had the 56SLC ( this is the 386SLC system ) running Dos/Windows , I had only one crash , and it was consistent . FTP had a tendency to crash whenever I would get large files ( > 1mb ) from particularly fast clients ( DTR 's 150K-200K/sec ) , I figured out the problem was with smartdrv 's write buffering -- if I turned off the write buffer , everything would work fine . FTP under OS/2 has never locked , though . I can even format floppies ( to use the most often cited example of the superiority of OS/2 . ) > For instance , I 'm still wondering why print preview in a windowed > WP 5.1 ( DOS ) locks up my system . Yeah , I guess I 'm willing to admit that OS/2 is somewhat sensitive to specific hardware . WP51 for DOS works perfectly fine on my SLC2 ... > Please explain .

Well , I save all my personal files to floppy , and when i did that under Windows , a floppy save of a large file hung up the system . I also found it quite bothersome to have to continually tweak the tasking options on fractint for dos whenever I wanted to do a fractal computation in the background . > > and not being able to address your memory better than DOS , > Not sure what you mean here . The idea is that OS/2 's DOS sessions can see more memory than Windows DOS sessions . I let XPL ( a shareware calculus program ) see around 720KB of free _conventional_ memory , which lets me do bigger symbolic manipulations than is possible under straight DOS ( where it would see around 610KB of conventional RAM. ) . I also found it really handy for my _own_ DOS-based programs , which , without any re-writing , could now handle larger data sets , simulate for more iterations , etc . Of course , the point is now moot , since the OS/2 programs I now write simply _never_ run into memory limitations . I never programmed for Windows , so I do n't have much of a comparison here , though ... .

Judging from the responses so far , I have not made clear enough in my article quoted above that Imake-TeX is not for installing TeX , but for *using* it .

We do them regardless . Kent Sandvik responds : > Hmm , it seems that this is the core of Christianity then , you > have to feel guilty . . . I think I see where you are coming from Kent . Jesus does n't view guilt like our modern venacular colors it . `` Feelings '' have nothing to do with guilt . Feelings arise from the state of being guilty . Feeling and guilt are mutally exclusive . Feelings are a reaction from guilt . Jesus is talking about the guilt state , not the reaction . Let me give you an example : Have you ever made a mistake ? Have you ever lied to someone ? Even a little white lie ? Have you ever claimed to know something that you really did n't know ? Have you ever hated someone ? Have you ever been selfish ? Are you guilty of any one of these ? The answer is of course , YES . You are guilty . Period . That is it what Jesus is getting at . No big surprise . Feelings do not even enter the picture . Consider Jesus 's use of the word '' guilt '' as how a court uses it . Jesus is concerned that everyone should admit that they are guilty of being imperfect . The Bible calls it the state that we are all sinners . We all do bad things . Even the most insignficant thing that we do wrong is proof of our guilt that we are all sinners . It is it in our nature to do bad things . We are sinners , therefore we do bad things . Being a sinner is fact . It is not a pleasant fact . But it is just a fact . We are not perfect . Calling us sinners should have no more emotional charge to you than calling you a human being . Guilty as charged . > and then there 's this single personality that will save you from this > universal guilt feeling . You can handle your guilt in one of two ways : Acknowledge you made a mistake , learn from it , and try to not do it again -- in the meantime , not punishing yourself for it : which is the way Jesus wants you to handle or it . This is the healthy way . Or two , the destructive way : put yourself down , slap yourself and feel like crap , never forgive yourself , force yourself to say a thousand Hail Marys . . . even to suicide . This the way Jesus does NOT want us to deal with it . All people fall into this category to some extent in their lives . Jesus is not in the business of saving us from this guilt feeling . Jesus is in the business of showing us how much he loves us despite our guilt . Jesus knows we are guilty . That is n't new to him . It is no big deal to him . He just wants you to realize that this sinful nature destroys the relationship between you and him . That is what he wants you to know . Why , because he wants to have your company . You are immensely valuable to him . Jesus wants a relationship with you , however , in our present sinful nature , we are incapable of having this relationship . God is perfect . We are not . You can not fit a square peg into a round hole . However , God has provided a way for us to change our nature so that we can have a relationship with him . God has provided Jesus , so that whosoever just believes in Jesus , will have their nature changed . The Holy Spirit will move it . And now divine nature is now within lives our very being -- and us and God communicate with each through his unifying Holy Spirit . The benefits of this are endless . For with the divine nature living within us , we can now see our imperfections better . We can now head them off at the pass . With the power of the Holy Spirit living in us , we now have his power to help us overcome our shortcomings . Because the divine nature lives within us , we can now understand profound Bible passages that never before we could understand . Because the divine nature now lives within us , we now have authority over demonic forces . And lastly , because the divine nature now lives within us , we have eternal life -- for the Holy Spirit is eternal . The relationship with Jesus is of the utmost importance . Because it is not what you do in life that qualifies you to belong to heavenly kingdom , it is your relationship to the living God . Remember what Jesus said at the tail end of Matthew when he separated the `` goats from the sheep '' . Many people in the last day will ask him , `` Did n't I prophesy in your name and do miracles , and do good things in your name ? '' And what did Jesus say ? `` Depart from me , for I never *knew* you . '' That is the cornerstone of Christianity , Kent . Jesus must know you as his friend . It is your relationship to Jesus . If he is your friend and you are his , you will be counted among those who will share in his inheritance in heaven . > Brian , I will tell you a secret , I do n't feel guilty at all , > I do mistakes , and I regret them , however I 've never had this > huge guilt feeling hanging over my shoulder . Good . It shows that you have a strong self-image -- that you love yourself . That is the second greatest commandment Jesus taught . If only more people could do as you do . As I said before , in the common english venacular , `` feeling guilty '' has a different meaning than the state of guilt . > This all is a very clear indication that you need a certain > personality type in order to believe and adjust to certain > religious doctrines . And if your personality type is > opposite , then you are not that easily attached to a certain > world view system .

The nice > thing is that when you finally shake off this huge burden , > the shoulders feel far more relaxed ! Yes . You have stated what Jesus said . Remember ? `` Come to me , take my yoke upon your shoulders , for my burden is light . '' A yoke is used to direct oxen to do work . Once you have a relationship with Jesus , you and him share the yoke and the burdens of life . Having God at your side is of great advantage .

Certainly in the UK the 21Mb flopticals are about the same price as a cheap CD-ROM now ( you seem to be able to get them for around GBP 200-250 ) . However the bigger optical drives ( e.g . 128Mb ) are much more expensive - around the GBP 1000 mark . A couple of questions that someone may be able to answer - the 21Mb flopticals - are they direct drop in replacements for a floppy or do they need driver software etc . I.e . do you just rip out the floppy drive , plug the same cables into the floptical , stick in a flopti-disk and hey presto you have a 21Mb floppy . This sounds far too easy . On the subject of Sony developing MDs for computers , I have reread a PCW article on this subject and there it says that Sony have been doing optical drives for other people for some time and may be about to do a product themselves . From the article it seems that the audio MD format is a byproduct of their computer storage work - the MD mechanism is identical to their MO computer optical drives . A Sony spokesman was quoted as saying that a 2.5 '' MD disk would hold about 100Mb of data though he refused to comment on any possibility of this being productized . The article said that one of the problems holding back development in this area was lack of sensible standards plus there are at least 2 distinct optical storage mechanisms around at present . Given that it probably needs MDs being used as a distribution medium to get it into the market and since this has already been cornered by CDs it probably needs someone to come in with a very strong marketting lead to get MDs accepted . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- david shepherd : des @ inmos.co.uk tel : 0454-616616 x 625 inmos ltd , 1000 aztec west , almondsbury , bristol , bs12 4sq '' They did n't like the rates , they do n't like the poll tax , and they wo n't like the council tax .

Do I assume correctly from the above aricle that your mother has a historyy of cancer ? I was just wondeing , since you mentioned thhat she has an oncologist . A bone scan is a nuclear scan . Thperson receivving the scan is gven a dose of a radioactive tracer , and an imaging device is used to track the distribution of the tracer wwithin the body . The tracer is usually given intravenously . ( IV ) This means that the physician or his assistant will insert a needle into a vein and inject medicine into the vein . After a few minutes has passed for the tracer to circulate through the body , the person is scanned with an imaging device to detect high concentrations of the tracer . The radiologist or doctor is looking for areas that take up more of the radioactive tracer or less of it . As far as pain , the only pain comes from the needle stick that is required to start the IV line . What the doctor is probably looking for are changes in the bones that may have resulted from cancer . This is also why I was wondering if your mother has had cancer , since cancer can spread from one site and wind up in the skeletal system . I hope I have answered some of your questions . Feel free to e-mail me if you have more questions related to the bone scan or anything else related to your mother 's care . I 'm a newly graduated nurse , and I enjoy sharing information with other people to help them understand things that they did not know about before . My thoughts are with you both . Elisa B.

Israel will express its readiness to give the Palestinians control of more land than previously offered . According to the radio report , one estimate is that Israel will give the Palestinians control over as much as two thirds of the administered lands , as well as broad authority on water issues . Israel will seek to promote its offer to hold elections in the Territories in hopes of strengthening the position of the Palestinian delegation to the peace negotiations . According to Israel Radio , the Israeli delegation to the bilateral talks with the Palestinians will offer greater responsibilities to the Palestinian Executive Council allowing it certain legislative capabilities , without making it a symbol for Palestinian sovereignty .

That 's the trouble : *what* peak years ? He wavers between excellent and very good , with no real bell-shaped pattern in there . 1979 was a fine year ; 78 and 80 were merely really good .

All Muslims knew that the whole thing was set up to destroy Iraq , not to `` Liberate Kuwait '' , The people who were killed by the invasion are more ( many many more ) , than the ones that were killed by the Iraqis in their smaller invasion . I lived in the west , and I have seen how your media prepared you ( helpless naive Americans ) for a war against ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ No doubt you plan on exploiting `` helpless naive Americans '' for your own purposes . Hmm ... let 's see : Iraq even before the artificial conflict between Iraq and Kuwait that led to the invasion , as the CIA correctly predicted ( and pretended to be surprised not to know ) . It just happened that Saddam was so predictible and so arrogant and stupid . What would I have done : Most Muslims would choose 300 dead Kuwaitis over 200,000 dead Iraqis and 1000 dead Kuwaitis . The first case would happen if no western intervention happened , and the second case was a direct or indirect result of western envolvement . Possibly , if 200,000 Iraqis had indeed died , but this number is based on Greenpeace estimates . Greenpeace had compromised its alleged impartiality during the war by condemning the potential environmental consequences of Allied miiltary action , while initially *completely* ignoring Iraq 's horrible environmental crimes , starting with the dumping of millions of barrels of oil into the Gulf at Ahmadi to the blowing of over 700 oil wells . What is the real number ? There has been a lot of work on this in the last two years , none of it reported as the Greenpeace figure seems to get continuously bandied about . The real number seems to be around 10,000 , on the same order as the number of Kuwaitis killed , tortured and kidnapped during the occupation . I've included an article I recently posted below , but this is really old news . Independent Television News reported a figure around 15,000 only a few months after the war , but it was hardly reported . For the Allies to have killed 200,000 Iraqis , they would have had to kill twice the *total* number of Iraqis in Kuwait . The favored image of the hysterics is the last battle of the war at Mutla ' . This was yet another example of the American and European media playing into the hands of Iraq and its de facto allies . The destruction of the Iraqi convoy at Mutla ' was portrayed as an all-out slaughter . This is simply not true . The head and tail of the convoy was bombed initially , resulting in a lot of casualties at these points . Before bombers came back , most of the rest of the Iraqi soldiers fled on foot . Furthermore , your estimates of Kuwaiti war dead if Allies had n't invaded is completely ridiculous . You have acknowledged ( certainly implicitly ) that Saddam is a barbarous brute . You have acknowledged the hundreds of thousands he has been responible for killing *in his own country* . You *know* that the man he appointed as governor of Kuwait , Ali Majid , was his most brutal henchman , presiding over the near genocide of the Kurds in the late 80 's and , more recently , the Shi ' a . Yet , when it comes to his treatment of Kuwaitis , he is an angel . In your estimate , he would 've killed *fewer* than he already had when the war started . What a joke ! APn 03/09 0006 Iraq War Dead Copyright , 1993 . The Associated Press . All rights reserved . By NICK LUDINGTON Associated Press Writer WASHINGTON ( AP ) -- After the Persian Gulf War ended , the world was told that as many as 100,000 Iraqi soldiers were killed . At one point , even Baghdad put the toll that high , as did the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency in private . But U.S. officials have been backpedaling ever since , even though the Pentagon has yet to settle on an official estimate to release to the public . Now , one former DIA analyst says the number of Iraqi troops killed may have been as low as 1,500 . That conclusion by John Heidenrich , writing in the current issue of the quarterly magazine Foreign Policy , represents the lowest estimate yet from U.S. defense sources . The revisions suggesting a less devastating Iraqi toll fit a pattern of vastly moderated U.S. military claims in the months after the war ended . Claims for a number of U.S. weapons also were scaled down . Despite the dramatic videotapes of successful weaponry or the shocking pictures of Iraq 's disastrous retreat from Kuwait , arguments have continued unabated about what really happened in the Gulf War . Heidenrich is not the first to question the Iraqi death toll numbers that originally were aired . More that a year ago , Air Force Lt. Gen. Charles Horner , the commander of the air campaign in the Gulf War , said he believed the Iraqi military death toll was fewer than 10,000 for the entire war . The Pentagon itself still refuses to provide an estimate of the number of Iraqis who died in the 42-day war against the U.S.-led coalition in January and February 1991 . On Monday , Pentagon spokesman Lt. Cmdr . Joe Gradisher reiterated past statements that `` there just is n't a number , '' that is credible . But some current internal estimates range from 8,000 to 25,000 Iraqi troops killed , said one analyst , speaking on condition of anonymity , who is familiar with the Pentagon 's reports . Allied deaths were put at 146 Americans , 35 by friendly fire ; 24 British , 9 by American fire ; 2 Frenchmen , 1 Italian and 39 among various Arab allies . Of the postwar reassessments , the most widely publicized was the Army 's reluctant acknowledgement , months later , that its touted Patriot air defense system was nowhere near so effective as claimed against Iraq 's Scud missiles . The Bush administration initially claimed an almost perfect record for the Patriot ; last spring it revised the hit ratio to 60 percent . The success record of the Navy 's Tomahawk high-tech cruise missile used against targets in Baghdad and other parts of Iraq also turned out to be more modest than initially indicated by the Pentagon . The first Iraqi casualty figures to surface after the war came in a May 1991 report by the environmental group Greenpeace , which said 100,000 to 120,000 Iraqi soldiers were killed . It estimated that 5,000 to 15,000 Iraqi civilians were also killed . The same month , published reports said the Defense Intelligence Agency estimated 100,000 Iraqi soldiers were killed and 300,000 wounded in the air and ground campaigns -- although the agency qualified that by saying the estimate could be off by as much as 50 percent in either direction . But as more information became available , those figures gradually were revised downward . The House Armed Services Committee staff estimated 9,000 dead and 17,000 wounded after a review last year . But Heidenrich , writing in the current issue of the quarterly Foreign Policy , estimated the total death toll from both the air and ground offensives as low as 1,500 -- with about 3,000 wounded . Heidenrich based the conclusion in his article on the number of bodies found and buried by U.S. troops -- 577 -- and on prisoner of war interviews . He noted that only about 2,000 of 69,000 Iraqi prisoners of war were wounded . Based on the calculation that about half as many wounded escaped as were captured , he put the number of wounded at about 3,000 . Using a conservative ratio of one dead to two wounded , applicable to Third World armies like Iraq , he set battlefield deaths at 1,500 . `` Maybe the figures are too low , '' he wrote . `` Maybe the real death toll on the battlefield was 2,000 or 3,000 or even 6,000 . Even then , the evidence suggests a death toll of well below 100,000 -- or even 10,000 . '' In an interview , he said the 100,000 figure was obviously off base because it would mean that virtually all the Iraqi soldiers in the Kuwait theater of operations were casualties . He said today 's bloodiest wars were not those fought with high technology , but rather the drawn-out conflicts such as those in Yugoslavia and Somalia .

If you do n't agree with Joseph 's accurate statement of the Catholic dogma of Mary 's perpetual sinlessness , then how do you interpret Luke 1:28 , And when the angel had come to her , he said , `` Hail , full of grace , the Lord is with thee . Blessed art thou among women . '' and Luke 1:48 ? ... for , behold , henceforth all generations shall call me blessed . I suppose that these verses might be interpreted to mean that Mary was possessed of some limited quantity or quality of grace , just as some of us are , but it seems to me that `` full of grace '' means just what it says : filled to the brim , incapable of containing more . The only other people we know of who have an abundance of grace are those souls existing in heaven now ( another Catholic dogma , based on the communion of saints , as I explained in an earlier post ) . Full of grace to me means sinless , and anyone who has ever sinned in his life can not be without sin in the same sense as Mary was sinless . As a Catholic , I too find certain of the dogmas tough to embrace . But that 's where the Catholic faith and prayer come into play . I pray God to strengthen my will to accept the faith given the bride of Christ , which in turn usually strengthens my community faith in His Church . And , as you probably know , faith in Christ 's Church is tantamount to faith in Christ inasmuch as the Church is Christ 's Mystical Body . A Catholic by nature must have two aspects to his faith in Christ : ( 1 ) a personal faith in Christ as his own personal redeemer and ( 2 ) a community faith in the Church as the body of Christ . -- Randal Lee Nicholas Mandock Catechist gt7122b @ prism.gatech.edu [ You might want to check the Greek . `` full of grace '' translates a single word that simply means `` favored '' , or perhaps more literally , '' graced '' . The `` full '' is a vestige of the specific translation you're using . -- clh ]

When they use the _same_ deconvolution software on the images from the fixed Hubble , be ready for some incredible results ! There is every reason to believe that the results will _exceed_ the original specs by a fair margin . Adaptive optics is a combination of hardware and software . It works realtime , not after the fact , as is the case with Hubble . You might be interested to know this technology has made it to the amateur market , in the form of the AO-2 Adaptive Optics System . Starting on page 52 of the April , 1993 Sky & Telescope is a three page review of this new product . It lists for $ 1,290 . The article states : `` The AO-2 Adaptive Optics System comes in a handy soft-plastic case that a three-year-old could carry around . '' Even though this device is really only good for the brightest objects , `` it could cope with image movements of up to 0.8 millimeter in the telescope 's focal plane . '' Now just imagine how well this infant technology will do in a few years , especially in a dedicated system that has hundreds of thousands of dollars , and many man-hours invested in its development .

Withrow Associates , 21 Railroad Ave , Swampscott MA 01907-1821 USA For those who are interested , the FCC does indeed care about cable leakage , particularly into the aviation nav band , or leakage that is `` causing interference to other services '' . Part 76.611 details specific limits to acceptable leakage , and measurement technique . If you will clearly document your problem , and measurement technique ( a signal level meter with dipole is the normal approach , remember to correct between measurement data and microvolts per meter ) and fax or mail the details to Mr. John Wong Cable Branch , FCC 1919 M st. NW Wash DC , and a copy of your letter to the local cable company , you will get results . In fact the cable company will probably start treating you much better when they realize you have figured out how to get the FCCs attention . What is important is to document your case as it relates to the applicable rules . However the cable company *is required* to at least check out every complaint of leakage . They must file with the commission and maintain on premises a yearly measurement report that details the results of leakage testing . But remember , call the cable company first , and give them a chance to work to correct the problem before contacting the commission . I am in the business of measuring cable system leakage via the airborne method . -- SCOTTCR @ WKUVX1.BITNET aka Chris Scott- Telco : ( 502 ) 745-3834

From : jhpb @ sarto.budd-lake.nj.us ( Joseph H. Buehler ) Subject : Re : Baptism requires Faith Organization : none Lines : 43 ( Aaron Bryce Cardenas ) writes : Romans 10:16-17 `` But not all the Israelites accepted the good news . For Isaiah says , 'Lord , who has believed our message ? ' Consequently , faith comes from hearing the message , and the message is heard through the word of Christ . '' So then we receive God 's gift of faith to us as we hear the message of the gospel . Faith is a possible response to hearing God 's word preached . Kids are not yet spiritually , intellectually , or emotionally mature enough to respond to God 's word . Hence they can not have faith and therefore can not be raised in baptism to a new life . Catholics view the effects of Baptism slightly differently , and that's one primary reason why they baptize babies . They believe that Baptism produces a change in the soul of the baby , quite independently of any volitional act on the part of the baby . This change in the baby's soul gives the infant certain capabilities that he would not have without Baptism . Since the infant does not have the use of his intellect and will yet , these new faculties are dormant . But as the child gets older , the gifts of Baptism come more and more into play . Ezekiel 18:20 `` The soul who sins will die . The son will not share the guilt of the father , nor will the father share the guilt of the son . The righteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him , and the wickedness of the wicked will be charged against him . '' If you read all of Ezekiel 18 , you will see that God does n't hold us guilty for anyone else 's sins . So we can have no original guilt from Adam . Adam was given a number of gifts by God . The chief among them was what Catholics call `` sanctifying grace '' . ( In the New Testament , the word used for this is `` charity '' . ) By his sin , Adam lost this grace . He did n't lose it just for himself , however , he lost it for the whole human race . Because once he lost it , he could n't pass it on to his descendents . That 's why Catholics baptize babies . Through his Original Sin , Adam lost sanctifying grace for all his descendents . Christ instituted Baptism to give it back to everyone . Babies are not being punished for anything they personally did ; they are simply lacking in something they need , in order to enter Heaven .

I wonder how hard it would be ( i.e . what it would add to the cost ) to design desktop machines with a power saver feature built in which would reduce power consumption automatically if the machine is idle for more than some amount of time . This is pretty standard in portable machines , and the same kinds of tricks could be played ; spinning down disks , turning off screens , reducing clock speed , etc . The advantage of this over just turning the thing off would be 1 ) you do n't have to remember to do anything and 2 ) the machine is still available over the network . The tricky part might be in defining what constitutes inactivity . Certainly , you do n't want to wake up from sleep mode just because somebody pinged you , but you do want to wake up ( at least the CPU ) if somebody logs in via a telnet connection . I would n't worry too much about wasting electricity in the winter months ; that energy is just getting turned into heat . It may not be as efficient a way to heat a building as the central heating plant , but it's not too bad . In the summer though , it 's a disaster . Not only are you wasting that power , but you 're probably also running the air conditioning to get rid of the waste heat . -- Roy Smith < roy @ nyu.edu > Hippocrates Project , Department of Microbiology , Coles 202 NYU School of Medicine , 550 First Avenue , New York , NY 10016 '' This never happened to Bart Simpson .

My interpretation of Denning 's description is that S1 and S2 are chosen randomly by agents of the key escrow companies at the start of each 300- chip programming session . I imagine that the chips are in a carrier which will allow them all to be programmed fairly quickly - there would not be a need to transfer chips one at a time into a little PLA programmer as some people have envisioned . My guess as to why this procedure is used is that basing the keys on the S1 and S2 using a specified algorithm provides an ( in-principle ) checkable way to verify that no back doors exist in the choice of the random numbers used to generate the keys . Since we have to trust the escrow companies anyway , it does not weaken the system to have the keys be generated from random seeds entered by the escrow agents . And since the algorithm for key-generation is public ( modulo Skipjack secrecy ) then in principle an agent could challenge the procedure , ask for S1 and S2 to be exposed , and run his own independent calculation of U1 and U2 to verify that that is what is actually being put onto the floppies . And yes , there are many ways in which failures to follow this scheme could be hard to check . The laptop probably will not really be destroyed each time . Hidden cameras in the ceiling could see the S1 and S2 entered by the trusted escrow agents . Back doors in the chip could allow U to be recovered . Heck , each chip could be recorded with the same U , ignoring what was on the floppy . Hal Finney

Well , if it is one of those that comes with windows , just highlight the item by clicking once on it , click on 'File ' and then on 'Properties ' . You should see a box which says 'Change icon ' . Click on it . You are going to be presented with some icons ( sometimes just one ) . If you do n't like any of those presented , click on the 'browse ' box , and look for the file 'moricons.dll ' Select it . Browse through the icons presented , and just double click on your desired icon . If you want to replace it with an icon from some other icon manager , say iconPower for instance , open the icon manager at the bottom of your screen , where it will not block the application icon you wish to replace . When you have found your desired icon , click on it once , and while holding the mouse button down , pull this icon over the one you wish to change .

If a manifestation such as God is truly infinite in power can God place limits upon itself ? . . Some stuff I ca n't recall . Then some other questions I think I recall correctly : Can God unmake itself ? Can God make itself ( assuming it does n't yet exist ) ? Has God has always existed or is it necessary for an observer to bind all of Gods potential quantum states into reality ? Was God nothing more than a primordial force of nature that existed during the earliest stages of universal ( inflationary ? ) creation ? Is God a vacuum fluctuation ? Given a great enough energy density could we re-create God ? Would that make US God and God something else ? . . Some more stuff I do n't recall concerning creating God . Followed by : Is God self-aware ? Is it necessary that God be self-aware ? Is God a living entity ? Is it necessay that God be a living entity ? Is God unchanging or does it evolve ? . .

Every Vote Counts ... ... ..Feel free to Flood my mail ! ! ! Rationale -- -- -- -- - The rationale for this proposal is a need for those interested or involved in the publishing of cdrom materials to have a forum for the discussion relating to their needs . At the moment the main fora for such discussion are in alt.cd-rom and comp.multimedia neither of which have publishing as their focus . Some lists serve the general cdrom community with focuses on library , government and network usage , and until several weeks ago none were devoted to publishing ( CDPub has just been setup ) . In any case a list is not , and ought not , be a replacement for regular usenet newsgroups . The reason for the division into three groups is a natural partition of interest between the hardware and software topics , and between the two main focal points of software , i.e . fulltext and multimedia publishing . Topics such as CDROM XA , CDI , CD-R , Photo CD and other related formats would be included as well . Topics related to cdrom publishing that are neither clearly hardware or software related such as books , copyright issues and other legal matters , packaging , distribution , could be included in the purvue of comp.publish.cdrom.software , as would any other nonhardware or multimedia topic that relates in some way to cdrom publishing , in any format , and is appropriate to the Internet .

From : JEK @ cu.nih.gov Subject : James and Sirach Lines : 31 On Thursday 6 May 1993 , Dave Davis writes : > I 'm leaning ... SIRACH ... is more directly referenced by JAMES > than JOB or RUTH is ... in any NT verse I 've seen . It would help if you mentioned chapter and verse from SIRACH and from JAMES . Job 5:13 ( `` He taketh the wise in their craftiness '' ) seems to be quoted in 1 Corinthians 3:19 . James 5:11 ( `` You have heard of the patience of Job '' ) , while not a quote , implies that James and his listeners are familiar with a story of a man named Job who exhibited exemplary patience . It is possible that the story they know is not that found in the Hebrew Bible , but rather another similar and related story . ( One has the same problem with direct quotes . ) Again , Matthew 1:5 ( `` Boaz begat Obed of Ruth '' ) tells us that Matthew knew a story about a woman named Ruth who married a man called Boaz and became the ancestor of David . Since Ruth is not mentioned in the OT outside the Book of Ruth , it seems likely that Matthew was familiar with the book and respected it , and thought Ruth important enough to be one of the few women mentioned in the genealogy . References like this do not prove that the NT writer considered his OT source inspired or inerrant or canonical . But neither do direct quotes . Yours , James Kiefer

From : maridai @ athos.rutgers.edu Subject : Traveling Fatima ( was Re : Consecration and Anniversary ) Lines : 48 Hello . I just like to share this rosary and other prayer propagation practice we do in my country . I am not sure if it is going on also here in the US or any other country . In all these 4 1/2 yrs . I 've been here in Illinois , USA , I have not encountered it . May I just call it `` Traveling Fatima '' since I do n't know of an exact translation of what we call it in my native language . For certain regions in a district in a town or city , an image/ statue of our Lady of Fatima is moved from one home ( originating from owner ) to another . This will stay with that family for one ( 1 ) week and this family is required to pray the rosary and other prayers ( prayer sheets accompany the image ) to our Lady of Fatima . The move will be like a simple procession of folks picking up the image from its current 'home ' after 'departing' prayers and proceeds to move it to the next home which has the prior notification about the move . There will be the 'receiving' prayers at the next home to welcome our Lady of Fatima image there . It does not have to be that only members of the family in that home who must pray to the image . They may invite others ( or others/friends can invite themselves in ; ^ ) ) to participate during prayer time in that 'new ' home everyday for one week . This image is moved from one family to the next within the bounded region of that district , until it goes back to the owner of the image . This is probably going on around there ( Philippines ) right now ( or somebody correct me when exactly since I forgot ) and every year , this is part of our devotion to our Lady of Fatima . It has been easy to facilitate this back home because it is more likely that your next door neighbor is a Catholic and the image then is just moved next door . I am thinking of starting something like it in the village where my sister and her family lives . Most of our friends and neighbors there are Catholics and practicing ones . I 'd like to know if there are any state/community laws that this practice will violate , whatsoever , before I go for it . Thank you for any comments or help about this matter . -- -Marida ( maridai @ ecs.comm.mot.com )

One usual suggestion is to put everything into your every-time shell rc-file instead of your login-only one , which is fair enough if you only have a few users who know what they 're doing . If you have several hundred users who do what the books tell them , though , then it 's confusing at best . Another is to have your xterms run login shells , but that still leaves the window manager and the things that get started from its menus with the wrong environment . Our alternative is that instead of having xdm run the client startup scripts , it runs the user 's favourite shell as a login shell , and has *it* then run the rest of the startup scripts . That way the user 's usual environment gets set up as normal and inherited by everything .

I am a relativist who would like to answer your question , but the way you phrase the question makes it unanswerable . The concepts of `` right '' and `` wrong '' ( or `` correct/incorrect '' or `` true/false '' ) belong to the domain of epistemological rather than moral questions . It makes no sense to ask if a moral position is right or wrong , although it is legitimate to ask if it is good ( or better than another position ) . Let me illustrate this point by looking at the psychological derivatives of epistemology and ethics : perception and motivation , respectively . One can certainly ask if a percept is `` right '' ( correct , true , veridical ) or `` wrong '' ( incorrect , false , illusory ) . But it makes little sense to ask if a motive is true or false . On the other hand , it is strange to ask whether a percept is morally good or evil , but one can certainly ask that question about motives . Therefore , your suggested answers ( a ) - ( c ) simply ca n't be considered : they assume you can judge the correctness of a moral judgment . Now the problem with ( d ) is that it is double-barrelled : I agree with the first part ( that the `` rightness '' of a moral position is a meaningless question ) , for the reasons stated above . But that is irrelevant to the alleged implication ( not an implication at all ) that one can not feel peace is better than war . I certainly can make value judgments ( bad , better , best ) without asserting the `` correctness '' of the position . Sorry for the lengthy dismissal of ( a ) - ( d ) . My short ( e ) answer is that when two individuals grotesquely disagree on a moral issue , neither is right ( correct ) or wrong ( incorrect ) . They simply hold different moral values ( feelings ) . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - John A.

From : jayas @ vast.unsw.edu.au ( Jayasooriah ) Subject : Experiences with DOS 6 Summary : Microsoft Botches it up ! Nntp-Posting-Host : oyster.vast.unsw.edu.au Organization : University of New South Wales , Kensington , Australia Lines : 236 ( I have been having trouble posting this article from within tin for over a week . If you do get multiple copies , my apologies . ) Here is a challenge to Microsoft or Microsort Supporters to defend the pathetic state of DOS 6 as an upgrade distribution -- it is a long story but would make good reading for those who are interested in knowing the potential pitfalls of `` upgrading '' to DOS 6 that I have been able to notice after only about a week of playing around with it . My envorinment ============== TI TravelMate 4000 WinSX ( 486SX/25 ) 4M Ram 120M Disk System BIOS version 1.03 05/21/92 by Texas Instruments CL-GD6420 VGA BIOS v 1.03 a1 by Cirrus Logic & Quadtel Advance Power Manager BATTERY.PRO v b6.00 by Texas Instruments Smart Drive Cache ( WIN3.1/DOS6 ) Parameters : 2048 1024 a- b- Windows Benchmark WinBench ( tm ) v 3.11 02/11/93 by ZD Labs After `` updgrading '' to DOS 6 , I could not understand why certain things became so slow , especially after I decided to try 'dblspace ' . In the process of finding out why , I discovered some interesting things . Disk Performance with Double Space and Smart Drive ================================================== While most things did not appear to slow down most of the time , certain applications appeared to run very much slower . What was interesting is that commands like 'chkdsk ' and 'defrag ' were running far too slowly to consider them useful by any standards . I suspected Double Space ( DS ) and decided to measure its impact on my system using WinBench ( tm ) . The Real Disk WINMARK of 20350 for the original system ( as shipped from factory with DOS 5 and Windowws 3.1 ) became 10718 when `` upgraded '' to DOS 6 with DS . Thus there is an effective performance degradation of more than 50 percent which did not really surprise me because I knew that DS compression must cost something . Specifically , for short sequential reads up to 512 bytes , DS actually *improves* transfer rates by about 10 % ( because CPU being faster than I/O , more CPU cycles needed for DS is more than compensated by savings in I/O cycles ) . However , for all other cases , particularly large random writes , the transfers take up to three times as long . While the performance depends on the type of access ( i.e random or sequential , small or large transfer units ) , on the average ( based on WinBench 's assumptions ) , the disk slows down to half its speed . The tests alone , done in 'real mode ' ( see WinBench ) and with smartdrv on , do not say much except that it helps to put into those subjective statements like 'there is no noticable difference in performance ' or even that 'it will speed up disk access when you have a fast CPU and slow disk I/O ' . This explained why some applications ran markedly slower , but not why 'chkdsk ' and 'defrag ' ( the latter especially ) too so long . Double Space and Windows ======================== DBLSPACE will not run at all from within windows , not even if you wanted to only to get information , not modify anything , or for that matter even check on its usage -- try `` fasthelp dblspace '' in a dos box within windows and you will see what I mean from the error message you get . How narrow minded can a programer get , I wonder . Yes , this information can be obtained through the mstools.dd add-on to file manager , but this 'mstools ' dll does not understand a compressed floppy ! ( Use the DOS 6 supplement utility to create a compressed floppy if you dont know how to . ) DOS 6 Defragmenter is incompatible with TI APM ============================================== Defragmentation seemed to take too much time . Even so , I waited patiently till it finished and then ran it again to just to confirm . This confirmation 'dblspace /def ' command for the 120M drive should take no more than 30 seconds ( much faster on other defragmenters I have used ) but it took 12 minutes . I discovered that if I moved the mouse , defragmentation checking ran faster ( the % figure ticked more rapidly ) . It dawned on me that this had to do with TI 's battery saver Advanced Power Management ( APM ) module which slows the clock down when it thinks that the CPU is idle , and it obviously thought DS defragmentation was an idle process ! After disabling the TI 's power saver , this operation took only 20 seconds . Microsft programmers think TI4000 and Gateway NOMAD users are idiots ==================================================================== In the readme.txt file , you can find the the following Running Microsoft Backup with TI4000 and Gateway NOMAD computers -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- To avoid a conflict between the Turbo feature and Microsoft Backup for Windows or MS-DOS , add a /L0 switch to the DEVICE command in your CONFIG.SYS that loads the BATTERY.PRO file . Or , before you run Microsoft Backup , type SETPOWER /L0 at the command prompt . If you checked TI 's manual on the /L0 option , you will realise that it means `` disable all power saving features of your notebook '' . Why would anyone want to run a driver disabled ! As I have found out , not only does TI 's power management interfere with Microsoft Backup as the readme.txt claims , but 'chkdsk ' and 'dblspace ' ( and who knows what else ) are crippled by the TI 's power saver . It is obvious that there is not such thing as APM specifications . If there indeed is such a thing , then either Microsoft programmers or TI programmers dont know how to read these specifications . You dont have to guess as to who are the idiots . By the way , if you run the advance power management utility , POWER.EXE in DOS6 , when you check the status , it says : Power Management Status -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Setting = ADV : MAX CPU : idle 60 % of time . This figure of 60 % seems to be the steady state value on my notebook when I am running nothing ( windows with only program manager in iconised form ) . Does that mean that Windows takes up 40 % of my CPU all for itself , and that I have at best only 60 % left for useful work ? Is such an overhead justified ( whether or not Windows is an operating system or just another user interface ) ? ( In DOS alone , it reports 99 % idle time . ) Looks like Windows is a good example of busy waiting type of package that I like my students to study as the classical 'negative' example of our times ! Microsoft programmers do not know batch programming =================================================== I like to structure my startup script and thus have the equivalent of addpath statements like this : set PATH=C : \DOS ... set PATH=C : \ETC\BIN ; % PATH % ; C : \BIN ... set PATH=C : \ETC\WINDOWS ; % PATH % ; C : \WINDOWS ... set PATH= % PATH % ; C : \BCC\BIN ... set PATH= % PATH % ; % MOUSE % Even though the new dos was installed in the same directory as the old one ( i.e . c : \dos ) , DOS 6 installation program modifes each and every path statement , and prepends C : \DOS to its value . As a result , my resultant path has so many DOS 's . If the installation program wanted to remove the old DOS path , and add the new DOS path , clearly it has to only scan for the path statement containg the old DOS directory and replace it by the new DOS path . ( Even this should only be done if the new DOS is installed in a directory different from the old one being 'upgraded ' . ) Instead , the Microsoft programmer ( if you can call this person one ) decided to meddle every path statement I had in the autoexec and prepend DOS to the value . I wonder if Microsoft is so desparate that it would not fire programmers who are incapable of the thought process . I started a thread on this when DOS 4 came up , and the Microsoft representative in Singapore called me about this poster . In fact he specifically said his US counterparts saw the poster and relayed the information to him as he did not have access to internet . Now that has not changed one bit . In fact , if you have a PATH statement with % PATH % already in it , is it not obvious that the this statement should not be touched for any reason ? As another example of the inability of Microsoft programmers to understand batch programming -- I had the mouse driver invoked as : set MOUSE=C : \ETC\MOUSE set PATH= % PATH % ; % MOUSE % loadhigh % MOUSE % \MOUSE.COM Guess what MEMMAKER did ? It replaced the last statement with LH ... C : \ETC\MOUSE\MOUSE.COM Why is it so difficult just to replace loadhigh with LH and its parameters , without touching the rest of the line , I do not understand . DOS 6 Software Quality ====================== DOS 6 is the only operating system I know , in which , under normal usage , you end up creating a file that you can not get rid of using of the commands that come with it . I am deliberately being cryptic about this : I challenge Microsoft to use all its programmers to catch this bug and publish it . If they dont within a week , I will post how you can create this `` ghost '' file . Surely if I can pick this bug without even looking for it after using a particular command only twice , I am sure two dozen Microsoft ( idiot ) programmers randomly banging on their keyboards over a week could find it -- that is what I was told how Microsoft `` tests the quality '' of their products . I think it is funny that Microsoft has found ways to `` test quality '' when it is accepted in the industry that quality can not be tested , but can only be built into the product . No wonder they can not provide any form of guarantees on their products , not even a decent list of bugs that will prevent scores of user from destroying their disks beyond repair ! Also , if you run 'dblspace /def ' often enough , repeatedly when the disk is fully defragmented , you may get errors , that was created by the defragmenters . I got my IO.SYS file size error and it got truncated when I did the chkdsk . This happend only after five successive defragmentation efforst after the first one supposedly did its job and with no new file creation since . Microsft , dont you dare reply to this poster on the network until you admit that your DS has bugs , and are willing to let us know what we should watch out for if we have already used DS .

These are things like the need for love and acceptance , and the need for meaning in life . If one denies the existence of spiritual things , one would presumably call these `` emotional needs '' . The reason Christians call them spiritual needs is that they have aspects that are not fulfillable except by spiritual means -- ie a person could be loved and accepted by many people , and do many meaningful things , but still have a need for love , which can only be satisfied by the love of God . Now the problem is that there are people who accept the existence of these needs , and people who reject them . Since I believe in absolute truth , some of these people are right , and the others are wrong . So here are the 2 possibilities : 1 ) If Christians are right , then we all have spiritual needs -- ie we all need God . Those who do not realize that they need God are deluded -- they just have n't recognized it yet . 2 ) If Christians are wrong , spiritual needs are an artefact of our brain chemicals . Well-adjusted and properly-integrated personalities do not have such things . Christians are simply using the concept of God and spiritual needs to mask their own inadequacies . I hate to belabour the point , but the existence of spirits and spiritual needs can not be objectively demonstrated or proven , just like the existence of God can not . And yes , this means that there is a risk that all my subjective evidence is manufactured by my brain chemicals . But on the other hand , I could venture into solipsism and say that there is a risk that everything that I appear to objectively know is really manufactured by my brain chemicals . I suspect this is an unsatisfactory answer to a request for evidence and demonstration of the existence of spirits and spiritual needs , but my assertion is that such things are not objectively demonstrable . As I have said before , I myself am on the Christian side of agnosticism , having been pushed off the fence by subjective evidence .

( It 's too slow . ) Why would you dispose a channel if you are going to play more sounds soon ? If you are trying to write a game , you shouldn't be using SndPlay . Instead , make a channel and use BufferCmds to play sounds on it . It works great . You can add CallBacks to the channel also to let you know when the channel is getting empty .

Callbacks are very reliable , I found them 100 % reliable , even under System 4.1 . I was doing continuous background sound with interrupting sound effects on System 6.0 with the IM-V documentation . You probably were cancelling your callback commands out of your channels , of course you did n't get called . In general , if you have problems with sounds working when you play one per channel and then close the channel ( with the related slowdown ) , but then when you play more than one you don't work , then you are adding more than one synthesizer to a channel , possibly the same one multiple times . This might be because you are calling SndPlay on a preexisting channel with a sound resource which adds the sampled sound synthesizer to the channel first thing before it plays . Most sampled sounds have this command at the start of them . You need to resedit the sound and remove that command , then when you create your channel , specify the sampled sound synthesizer to be the channel 's synth . Then you can use asynch sndplay 's all you want . You 'll probably want to switch to BufferCmd 's , since you are going to have to use SndDoCommand anyway to add callbacks . Now before you go ahead and tell me I am full of it , and the sound manager does n't work for games , remember , Spectre uses it . And it works great . If Spectre can spare the CPU time , you can too . One little disclaimer : There are some out there who say the Sound Manager in the IIsi ca n't be made to work right . I 'm not sure either way , but I know for sure that you can make your sounds work 100 % correctly on every other machine using the Sound Manager . -Steve

Organization : University of Illinois at Urbana Lines : 23 I have a '72 CL350 which I stopped riding about 2 years ago ( I upgraded to an '84 Sabre 750 ) . I parked it in the corner of my parking lot , and planned on draining the gas , spraying oil in the tank , etc . to get it ready to store . Well , after a lot of procrastination , all I ended up doing was throwing a tarp on it . Well , now I have to move and want to clean up the 350 . I tried starting it ( with someone else 's battery ) and had no luck . My first guess is that it is the gas and so I plan on draining it and replacing it with new gas ( I can only pray that I did n't trash the carbeurators ) .

But clearly It was a `` no-knock '' , according to the Associated Press report . Here 's something I found in my collection : Excerpts from an article in the Knoxville News-Sentinel Final Edition Monday , March 1 , 1993 ( the byline is associated press ) : WACO , Texas - Fierce gun battles erupted Sunday as more than 100 law officers tried to arrest the leader of a heavily armed religious cult . At least four federal agents and two cult members were reported killed . [ ... ] The gun battles began when federal agents hidden in livestock trailers stormed the sect 's head-quarters Sunday morning , ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ witnesses said . The agents had warrants to search for guns and explosives and to arrest Howell , said Les Stanford of the ATF in Washington . [ ... ] Witnesses said the law officers stormed the compound 's main home , throwing concussion grenades and screaming `` Come out , '' while three ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ National Guard helicopters approached . For a moment , there was no response . Then the shooting began .

There is no reason to believe that Paul 's thorn in the flesh was a sin in his life . That makes little sense in the light of Paul' writings taken in totality . He writes of how he presses for the mark , and keeps his body submitted . No doubt Paul had to struggle with the flesh just like every Christian . Paul does associate his thorn with a Satanic messenger , and with physical infirmities and tribulation , but not with a sin in his life . Link Hudson .

In one sense , no statement by another is subject to my private interpretation . If reliable historians tell me that the Athenians lost the Pelopennesian War , I can not simply interpret this away because I wanted the Athenians to win . Facts are facts and do not go away because I want them to be otherwise . In another sense , every statement is subject to private interpretation , in that I have to depend on my brains and expereience to decide what it means , and whether it is sufficiently well attested to merit my assent . Even if the statement occurs in an inspired writing , I still have to decide , using my own best judgement , whether it is in fact inspired . This is not arrogance -- it is just an inescapable fact .

[ ... . ] : Therefore I conclude that if you call yourself a hacker , and somebody : perceives you as a thief , then this person belongs to a very very : small group that has some computer knowledge , but not enough to know : the wider ( and original ) meaning of the word . [ ... . ] Unfortunately , the general public has a very narrow view of the deep , dark recesses of the art of computing . What little they do see is from the view given to them by the media . From what I have seen from the media , 'hacker' is not a proper way by which to refer to a respected person . I , on the other hand , know what 'hacker ' means from those who consider themselves such . Following is the definition from `` Jargon File 2.9.10 '' . ( This is also known as the `` Hackers Dictionary '' . ) The definitions are arranged in order of decreasing frequency of usage : : hacker : [ originally , someone who makes furniture with an axe ] n. 1 . A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems and how to stretch their capabilities , as opposed to most users , who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary . 2 . One who programs enthusiastically ( even obsessively ) or who enjoys programming rather than just theorizing about programming . 3 . A person capable of appreciating { hack value } . 4 . A person who is good at programming quickly . 5 . An expert at a particular program , or one who frequently does work using it or on it ; as in ' a UNIX hacker ' . ( Definitions 1 through 5 are correlated , and people who fit them congregate . ) 6 . An expert or enthusiast of any kind . One might be an astronomy hacker , for example . 7 . One who enjoys the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming or circumventing limitations . 8 . [ deprecated ] A malicious meddler who tries to discover sensitive information by poking around . Hence 'password hacker ' , 'network hacker ' . See { cracker } . The term 'hacker ' also tends to connote membership in the global community defined by the net ( see { network , the } and { Internet address } ) . It also implies that the person described is seen to subscribe to some version of the hacker ehic ( see { hacker ethic , the } ) . It is better to be described as a hacker by others than to describe oneself that way . Hackers consider themselves something of an elite ( a meritocracy based on ability ) , though one to which new members are gladly welcome . There is thus a certain ego satisfaction to be had in identifying yourself as a hacker ( but if you claim to be one and are not , you 'll quickly be labeled { bogus } ) . See also { wannabee } . : hacker ethic , the : n. 1 . The belief that information-sharing is a powerful positive good , and that it is an ethical duty of hackers to share their expertise by writing free software and facilitating access to information and to computing resources wherever possible . 2 . The belief that system-cracking for fun and exploration is ethically OK as long as the cracker commits no theft , vandalism , or breach of confidentiality . Both of these normative ethical principles are widely , but by no means universally ) accepted among hackers . Most hackers subscribe to the hacker ethic in sense 1 , and many act on it by writing and giving away free software . A few go further and assert that *all* information should be free and *any* proprietary control of it is bad ; this is the philosophy behind the { GNU } project . Sense 2 is more controversial : some people consider the act of cracking itself to be unethical , like breaking and entering . But this principle at least moderates the behavior of people who see themselves as ` benign ' crackers ( see also { samurai } ) . On this view , it is one of the highest forms of hackerly courtesy to ( a ) break into a system , and then ( b ) explain to the sysop , preferably by email from a { superuser } account , exactly how it was done and how the hole can be plugged -- - acting as an unpaid ( an unsolicited ) { tiger team } . The most reliable manifestation of either version of the hacker ethic is that almost all hackers are actively willing to share technical tricks , software , and ( where possible ) computing resources with other hackers . Huge cooperative networks such as { USENET } , { Fidonet } and Internet ( see { Internet address } ) can function without central control because of this trait ; they both rely on and reinforce a sense of community that may be hackerdom 's most valuable intangible asset . : Finally , a true hacker does not name himself/herself one , for this is : a title that is bestowed by the befuddled sysadmins and users at large . : To me , a sign of a truly great hacker is to be introduced to someone who : says `` Nahh , I just know a thing or two , people always exagerate ... '' : - ) Note that the above definition does not preclude a hacker from describing limself ( meaning : himself/herself ) one , but simply says that it is better not to do so . There are many who do not know the meaning of 'hacker ' . So , in order to defend the true meaning of the word , it is sometimes necessary to borrow on the reputation of a known ( respected ) hacker around the workplace . ( This means that 'hacker ' is defined in terms of some well-known and respected person . ) Sometimes , there may only be one such person . : > No matter what Mr. Dumpty says , language does n't work that way . : Actually it does , you just have to get adequate press coverage ... : - ) Language works anyway that we want it to work .

Knies '' < ISSCCK @ BYUVM.BITNET > Organization : Brigham Young University Lines : 78 Joakim Ruud ( joakimr @ ifi.uio.no ) writes : # Recently , I 've asked myself a rather interesting question : What RIGHT does # god have on our lives ( always assuming there is a god , of course ... ! ) ? ? # # In his infinite wisdom , he made it perfectly clear that if we do n't live # according to his rules , we will burn in hell . Well , with what RIGHT can god # make that desicion ? Let 's say , for the sake of argument , that god creates # every one of us ( directly or indirectly , it does n't matter. ) . What then # happens , is that he first creates us , and then turns us lose . Well , I didn't # ask to be created . # # Let 's make an analogue . If a scientist creates a unique living creature # ( which has happened , it was even patented ... ! ! ! ) , does he then have the # right to expect it to behave in a certain matter , or die ... ? Dear Joakim , let me begin by saying that these are excellent questions , but that by asking , you will find as many different explanations as there are respondents . As a Latter-day Saint , I believe that all of us ( you , me , etc . ) lived once as spirit-children of God the Father ( Hebrews 12:9 ) in the pre-mortal existance . In order to continue our eternal progression , an earthly probationary time was required . ( To live by faith , not by sight , to choose good over evil , and to prepare ourselves in all things to become worthy of a higher order of existance . ) We believe that all of God 's spirit-offspring were once assembled to discuss the specifics of this earthly sojourn . One-third chose for Lucifer 's plan , most followed the Firstborn ( the pre-mortal Jesus Christ ) . Lucifer 's aspirations ( `` I will exalt my throne above the stars of God . . . '' Isaiah 14:12-17 , etc . ) resulted into the rebellion of his followers against the Firstborn and those who followed Him , resulting in the casting out of Lucifer ( who became Satan , the father of lies ) and one-third of the hosts of heaven ( `` And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven , and did cast them to the earth . . . '' Revelation 12:4 ) as demons ( evil spirits ) . To get back on OUR choice to be born on this earth , and to be subject to God and His plan ( for good or bad , based upon our obedience and choices ) , we made that choice individually . ( God speaking to Job : `` Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth , . . . when the morning stars sang together , and all the sons of God shouted for joy ? '' Job 38:4-7 ) . We lost the knowledge of our pre-mortal existance ( the `` Veil of Forgetful- ness , '' somewhere in Psalms ) , in order to live by faith , not by sight . You may not accept this scenario , neither do quite a few who rely on the Bible alone , which offers only fragmentary insights into this particular aspect of our existence as individuals , as sons and daughters of God . # Who is god to impose its rules on us ? Who can tell if god is REALLY so # righteous as god likes us to believe ? Are all christians a flock of sheep , # unable to do otherwise that follow the rest ? # # Hmmmmmmmmmmmm . ( All Christians , by definition , ARE a flock of sheep , following the Shepherd as they understand Him ; - ) -- But in any event , not all Christians believe in the same theology , such as the one Latter-day Saints believe in . ( They will cry `` heresy '' and other accusations of `` perverting '' the doctrines of the Bible , while they themselves believe in a myriad of interpretations , as found in their catechisms and various do-it-yourself Bible-study manuals ... ) As for me , I have a personal conviction that the pre-existance scenario as explained above , is most in harmony with Biblical doctrine , some Dead Sea Scroll books , the pseudographion , other ( Jewish ) sources , and last but not least , modern-day revelation on the subject . # I just want to point out that this is not sarcasm , I mean it . # # How should one deal with a man who is convinced that # he is acting according to God 's will , and who there- # Jokke fore believes that he is doing you a favour by # stabbing you in the back ? # # -Voltaire Casper C.

You can do a whole hell of a lot better than 2 or 3 degrees with the differential timing measurements from the interplanetary network . Ignore the directional information from BATSE ; just look at the time of arrival . With three detectors properly arranged , one can often get positions down to ~arc minutes . BTW , about Oort cloud sources : should n't this be testable in the fairly near future ? Some of the GRBs have very short rise times ( < 1 ms ) . We could detect the curvature of the burst wavefront out to a distance of on the order of b^2/ ( t c ) where b is the detector spacing and t the time resolution . For t = 1 ms and b = 2 AU , this is on the order of 16 light years . I understand statistics will reduce this number considerably , as would geometry if the burst is coming from the wrong direction .

The argument is that we ca n't have half the > church not accepting the leaders of the other half . Maybe people will > -- clh ] It might be interesting for folk to know that the Church of Scotland ( also a Presbyterian church ) managed to `` agree to disagree '' over women 's ordination for 25 years . The reasoning was that congregations are free to call whoever they wish , and that Ministers and Sessions choose elders . If a congregation did not wish to have a woman , they were not obliged to , and if a Session did not wish to , they could not be forced to . ( Note that the who issue of freedom to call on the part of the Congregation is VERY important here - this year is the 150th Annivarsary of the Disruption , where the church split on that very issue , they did n't get back together for almost 80 years ) . A couple of years ago on the 25 anniversary of the allowing of womens ordination the position was changed - so that , in theory , all ministers and elders must recognise that women can be ordained . In theory , a minister who refused to ordain a woman to his Session , or refused to work with a woman minister in Presbytery , could be disciplined . In practice this has not happened , and I believe it is unlikely to happen . My personal view is that the new legislation was a mistake , and that the permissive ( but not prescriptive ) legislation worked very well . We are going to start going round the homosexual debate at next years assembly . At this years , a motion was put to ban the blessing of same-sex couples ( after an Edinburgh minister did so ) . Our Panel on Doctrine is currently looking at marriage , and will report next year - the matter will be considered and debated then . Hope this is interesting Alison

To the people who wrote the Bible and to whom the Bible is written , there is evidence of love , but that is a cultural bias . This is a poor answer which you need n't rebut . I will now pull the old bait and switch . I think you should use the Bible to judge man , not God . By that I mean , if your moral intuition does n't like what is described in the Bible , realize that such things are going on now . I will avoid the semantic arguments about the cause of evil and ask what are you doing to fight it ? Not you specifically , but everyone , including myself . If I do n't like the genocide in the Bible , what about the genocide that goes on right now ? To move beyond the question of a hell , realize that many people right now are suffering . If you think hell is n't fair and are willing to sacrifice everything just to deny its existence , what about how life is n't fair ? Right now there is a young mother with three little kids who does n't know how she will get through the day . Right now there is a sixth grader who is a junkie . Right now there is an old man with no friends and no money to fix his TV . Instead of why does n't God help them ask why don't we help them . I think you are correct to challenge any Christian who does n't live his life with the compassion you seem to possess . You want evidence of God . Find someone who is making a difference , someone you admire , someone who has been through some tough times and has come out with his head up . Ask the person how he does it . Ask the Vietnam vet who was battle medic how he kept his mind . Ask the woman who was pregnant at 15 , kept the baby and now is a successful business woman . Ask the doctor who has operated on a 1-1/2 pound baby . They wo n't all be Christians , or even what you might call religious , but there will be something in common . God is not defined in the Bible , God is defined by what is in those people 's hearts . It does n't matter if you ca n't give intellectual assent to any description you 've heard , they're all wrong anyway . The compassion you already feel in your heart is a step in the right direction . Follow that instead . Then come back and read the Bible and you 'll see that same thing described there . > > If nothing else makes sense , hang on to that idea , that God is love . > > I would say something similar , but in reverse order : love > is god .

So what will happen when the tv contract runs out , considering networks have been losing money on it ? Either ticket prices will go up , or someones salary will be cut , or perhaps the local community or merchindise could make up the difference .

Indeed they were worried about that . One concern was the possibility that they would lose a motor or something on the way up , and make orbit but one that was too low to give HST a useful lifetime against atmospheric drag . I believe the decision was to deploy HST even if the projected lifetime was as short as six months . In fact we got an excellent orbit , on the upper envelope of what the Shuttle can do . I have never heard of any serious consideration that HST might be brought down for refurbishment . You would have the horrendous cost of transporting , cleaning , re-testing , and re-certifying all the hardware on the ground , in addition to the lost observing time and the cost of a second deployment mission with the risks that we might not get such a good orbit the second time . And , you would probably STILL need a ( third ) servicing mission in a few years as gyros and other components wear out . Better to have two servicing missions in space ( which could well happen ) than to bring HST down and take it up again . Ben

Khafre with 24 rounds can be broken with the same attack using 2^53 different encryptions .

Source code for this algorithm ( and Khafre ) are in the patent . Snefru is a public-domain one-way hash function .

It never comes right and says `` Only people that know > right from wrong or who are taught can be baptised . '' This is not a very sound argument for baptising babies .

I know there 's a specific term for this form of logic , but it escapes me right now . However , if it were sound , then you should be able to apply it this way ; If the Bible does n't specifically say that something is wrong , then it must be OK , which , coincidentally , leads perfectly into a question I 've often pondered . If slavery is immoral ( which I believe it is , can I assume that everyone else in this group does too ? ) , why does n't Jesus or any of the apostles speak out against it ? Owning slaves was common practice back then . Paul speaks about everything else that is immoral . He apparently thought it was important enough to talk about things like not being a drunkard . Why does n't anyone mention slavery ? If God 's morals are eternal and don't change like the morals of society , then it must have been just as immoral then as it is today .

A 3-D widget is usually located in the same scene as other 3-D objects of the application . It may let you - manipulate application data , the camera , 3-D objects in the scene and so on , or - view the status of the application or 3-D objects via the widget 's shape , color , position , orientation and so on , or - do whatever I missed but you think is possible . For example , a manipulative widget can be virtual trackball ( shown as a partially transparent sphere ) super-imposed on the object to be rotated . A feedback widget can be a ruler with ends anchored to 2 objects . The length of the ruler changes as the objects move and a numeric value is shown on the ruler indicating the distance . A widget can provide both manipulation and feedback . For example , the ruler can be used to change the distance between the objects along its own axis . Please e-mail me or post your opinions on 3-D interaction . The information I gathered will help me design a 3-D UI construction tool . Your help is very much appreciated .

From : jc @ minya.UUCP ( John Chambers ) Subject : painting with increasing resolution Lines : 40 Some people working a few cubes over have come up with this need , and it seems that someone out there just might have done it already , and can point me to some tools that would help . What they 'd like to do is : Given a window that is taking a long time to draw ( because either the data is arriving over a slow link , or the $ DISPLAY is across a slow link ) , they would like to first paint a low-resolution version of the picture , and then repaint it in higher resolution . Thus , the picture might first be generated in 1/4 resolution , with each 4x4 square of pixels being filled in with a single color . Next , each 4x4 square would be replaced by 4 2x2 squares ; finally the 1x1 version would be painted . Since one of the scenarios is with the window being on the other side of a slow link , the low-res version obviously would n't be transmitted as a bitmap ; that would n't help at all . Instead , there would have to be a process on the far end that receives the low-res picture as a small bitmap , and blows up each pixel into a square ( sorta like the magnifier programs do ) . This brings up the question of whether the X server can help . That is , when a window is opened , is there a way to ask that a `` filter '' program be run to process the pixels ? Or is the only way to use something like rsh to start up a remote process ( `` Permission denied '' ; - ) , and have it open a local window ? It seems the most likely scenario is a library routine that starts up such a program remotely , and then accepts bitmaps , compressing each one by some amount , and sending them to the remote program to expand . But if there is something that X itself can do to help , it 's be nice to hear about it . ( I looked in several FMs , but if it 's there , I obviously do n't know the keywords ; - ) . If someone has a nifty tool available that packages it all , we might want to get a copy . Oh , yes ; this is to run on some Suns . Part of the idea is to build demos that can show such things as `` If this were run across , say , a 4800-bps link , this is how fast the pictures would appear .

I find it very interesting that you say there will be 2.5 million queers in the march on Washington . The largest figure I 've seen in the press is 1 million and we all know how liberal the press is with their numbers . : ) For another thing , 1 % of 250 million is 2.5 million not 6 . Maybe that 's where you got the 2.5 million number . Also , the number cited in the actual report is 1.5 % so that would be about 3.75 million . As for this march on Washington , I wonder how much the media is going to inflate the numbers this time . Last time , for the pro-abortion rally , they more than doubled the actual number of people who showed up . That and all the stories coming out of how the press `` slants '' the news really makes one wonder who 's watching the watchers .

In storage , either the electrolyte should be removed and replaced for use ( fat chance I 'd ever do that at home ) , or the battery should be stored on a trickle charge . I have also ( I think ) read that the condition may be reversable if hooked up to a current limited charging circuit fro a LONG period of time . The refernce I remember is to use C/50 ( where C is the amp hours ) as the charging circuit , and leave it hooked up for weeks . Some of this may only apply to Gel type cells , but I suspect the same applies to the liquid type . Richard Dell

Forensic experts will study the rubble and ashes of the Branch Davidian compound , where at least 85 people , including 24 children , perished in smoke and fire caused by theapocalyptic visions of a manipulative madman AND A STUNNING LAPSE IN JUDGMENT BY FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS . [ emphasis added by me ] Investigators will re-create conditions at the compound and identify accelerants and other fac- tors fueling the inferno . That is their strong suit . But the public must question why agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation lacked the oper- ational skill and teh behavioral insight to resolve the 51-day standoff free of flames and fury . The loss of life most clearly reflects the demen- tia of cult leader David Koresh , whose personal delusiosn are now seared on the public conscious- ness . His assembly of Davidians had stockpiles of arms -- and had used them . LIttle in the way of rationality could be expected from Koresh , a self- confsesed `` sinner without equal . '' What continues to mystify are th eactions of federal agents , who bungled the case from the start . The misadventure began on Feb. 28 when 100 agents of the federal Bureau of Alcohol , To- bacco and Firearms storemd the compound , intent on seizing Koresh and a cache of automatic weap- ons . Four agents and an estimated six cult mem- bers died inteh ensuing gun battle . Earlier oppor-tunities to isolate and arrest Koresh outside the complex had not been adequately explored . Authorities prepared a siege and resolved that those deaths would be the last . Fifty-one days into the siege there was no public outcry to storm the compound . It had been correctly perceived that the chil- dren inside `` Rancho Apocalypse '' were essentially hostages . With their lives at stake , there was no reason for the government to be impatient . The government 's superior firepower , control of water and utilities and freedom of movement created the conditions for a belated but bloodless resolution . Neither Attorney General Janet Reno nor the FBI has provided a sigle compelling reason for abandondoning the course of patience . If intelligence was accurate and Koresh was growing increasingly violent and bizarre , it is diffi- cult to see how a tear-gas attack launched by an M-60 combat vehicle would clear his mind . If re- ports of escalating child abuse were accurate , they would have to be weighted against the potential for eve ngreated hamr . etc etc tec ... . [ paragraphs , 2.5 paragraphs deleted ] But some of the responsibility rests with Clinton , and inexperienced president who did not pay enough attention to the life-and -death decisions being made on WAco . If Reno is to be faulted for anything , ti would be for her overreliance on the judgment of law en- forcement officers -- a common problem among prosecutors . Full investigations into th eWaco tragedy must be conducted by both the executive and legislative branches . The first step is to verify how the blaze started . Though apportioning blame will play a role , it is of greater importnace to find strategies to elude the fire next time . [ end of editorial ] -J . Case Kim kim39 @ husc.harvard.edu

The rest of the great Canadian scientists will appear in an appedix with one paragraph biographies . If you have any other ideas about this project , I am interested to hear them .

It 's amazing to see just how much was discovered by Canadians . Actually there are many more who were born in Canada , but became Americans after graduate school . Please note : a lot of people have nominated Alexander Graham Bell but I feel he was really a Scottish/American with a summer home in Canada . Now I know this is debatable , but please do n't nominate him again . If anyone can fill in some of the question marks on the list , please drop me a line . ================================================== That was two years ago . Since then , I have received a grant from Science Culture Canada , a division of Supply and Services Canada to research the book . Since my old posting the book has evolved into an educational book for kids aged 9 - 14 ( though this may change again ) It will have about 40 two-page spreads with a large graphic in the middle and text/graphic boxes all around on the following subjects : Vital statistics and photo of the scientist , Personal statement from the scientist , Narrative of a few moments in the life of the scientist , `` What I was doing when I was 12 '' , So you want to be a < insert kind of scientist > , Experiment you can do . There will be an appendix with 100 - 200 more scientists with one paragraph biographies who did n't quite make it to the double spreads . The whole thing will then be published on CD-ROM with video and sound clips for added richness . I am looking for a CD-ROM publisher as well . The text part may also be available on the CANARIE electronic highway being developed in Canada as well . I am still looking for a publisher though Penguin Canada came close to being it . Hope to find one soon . I would like to again ask for more nominations , especially in the pure sciences of Physics , Chemistry and Biology . Also criticisms of the list are welcomed . Also women and French-Canadian scientists are needed . I hope this posting will get others to nominate more Great Canadian Scientists , and to discuss what is `` great '' what is `` Canadian '' and what is '' scientist '' .

They need to be discussed in detail , indeed . But for the purposes of this newsgroup and thread thus far and in this newsgroup , I risked oversimpli- fication . My main purpose was to emphasize that I was not coming from a Buddhist or Hindu point of view . As you observed , the main context is that of Christianity . But by all means , add comments and corrections as you find them . I wrote a longer reply addressing some of your points , but decided to not post it . Perhaps it would be more appropriate for soc.religion . eastern . Instead I just add the following couple of items about karma and reincarnation as I see the matter from an anthroposophical and a Christian point of view . 1 . Karma is not simple reward and punishment dealt out by a `` judging deity '' . 2 . Reincarnation is not the same as being born again . 3 . Reincarnation is not the same as the resurrection of the body . 4 . Reincarnation and karma do not contradict the fundamental teachings of Christianity about God , the fall , the being . incarnation , death , and resurrection of Christ , his coming again , sin , grace , forgiveness , salvation , and the last judgement . > Is n't Origen usually cited as the most prestigious proponent of reincarnation > among Christian thinkers ? What were his views , and how did he relate them > to the Christian scriptures ? > > Jack Carroll Origen 's work was mostly lost . He was not anathematized , to my knowledge , but his writing comes down largely in fragments and quotations from enemies . Perhaps someone else can comment on Origen . I do n't know if there is a specific statement about reincarnation from him , but from what I do know about him he probably did hold to the teaching in one form or another . I do n't know too much about the history of the idea of reincarnation in the Church . However , I heard an interesting story about Pope John Paul II from an astronomer who teaches at the University of Cracow . The Pope likes to go to Poland for a scientific conference every couple of years so he can relax and talk Polish to friends and fellow countrymen . My acquaintance , an anthroposophist , related the fact that Woitila knew about Steiner and Anthroposophy from his early days . Before he became a priest he was an actor in a dramatic company in Cracow whose leader was a pupil of Steiner and based his acting and directing methods on Steiner 's indications . Part of the work was the study of the basic works of anthroposophy . Well , going to this conference with him a few years ago , the astronomer and another Polish anthroposophist thought they would ask the Pope what he thought about Anthroposophy . They chickened out at the last minute , but one of them did ask him what he thought about reincarnation . The Pope smiled and said , '' Actually there have been quite a few good Catholics who believed in reincarnation , '' and he proceeded to name several from the earliest times to modern times . Then he changed the subject . My Polish friend did not say whether Origen was among those he mentioned . Gerry Palo ( 73237.2006 @ compuserve.com ) [ As far as I know Origen himself was not anathematized . He was controversial , but avoided outright condemnation during his lifetime . However some of his views were condemned at a Council in Alexandria in 400 and two councils in Constantinople in 543 and 553 . I am fairly sure the preexistence of souls is one of the doctrines condemned . -- clh ]

( Re : the newsgroup -- followups set to talk.politics.mideast where this belongs . ) This may make the term 'civil war ' dubious , but it does nothing to the phrase 'destroy the government ' . An occupying government is still a govern- ment , and the Palestinians have made it quite clear that their goal is not simply to prevent it from occupying the territories that do n't con- fer citizenship ( which is your own determination of the distinction ) but to wipe it out entirely ( and , not incidentally , the entire Jewish population it rules with it ) . This is an intent to 'destroy the government ' , no matter where the government happens to be from . > If the > current government in Isreal would be willing to let all adult individuals > who are capable to > vote in elections within the _DEFACTO_ boundaries of the Isreali > state , a requirement for being called a democracy in my opinion , Was n't a requirement for democracy in Athens . For that matter , isn't a requirement for the term democracy in the United States , which doesn't let non-citizens vote either . Both the United States and Israel have processes whereby it is possible to acquire citizenship , with a great deal of effort and a modicum of screening -- it 's just that it isn't automatic for living in the territories . It is n't automatic for living in New York , either . That said , suit yourself . Having never considered democracy the ultimate in Good In This World , I could care less if you feel like calling Israel , or America , or anywhere else , a democracy . Personally , I withhold the term from Israel for the same reason I withhold it from Britain ... the parliamentary system is a serious handicap . > then Mr. Frank would be correct . As the current government neither > is willing to > enfrachise the vast majority of individuals in the territories or to > allow these people to have the right to self determination it is not > a civil war or THEIR government , rather it is resitance to a FOREIGN > occupier . Again , suit yourself . In which case Israel is *not* attacking its own people , it is fighting a war on foreign soil , in which case the residents are entitled to play rough , yes -- but Israel 's allowed to get just as rough , within the bare limits of the rules of war . This includes , among other things , the right to shoot or bomb *anyone* a national of the coun- try in question who is fighting them ( which permits mass frontal assault on all rock-throwers ) , along with the right to take out any installation of military importance ( certain villages with too-good fortifications can be handled by aerial bombing , as can waterways since they count as supply lines to the enemy ) , and the right to do anything whatsoever to whatever constitutes a government that they can lay hands on ( if Hamas is trying to set up as the ruling party , let them beware ) . If this is not the scenario you want , I recommend you go back to calling it a civil war . Civil wars have to be handled nicer . You can not say the Palestinians are a nation fighting a resistance war against a foreign nation and still call Israel a government who is treating its own people cruelly . If the Palestinians are fighting a war against a foreign country , so is Israel , and the gloves come *off* . -Naomi -- Yes , it is bread we May the Source of peace fight for , but we fight Naomi Rivkis in the heavens bring peace for roses too . rivk @ midway.uchicago.edu to us , and to all Israel .

It proved to have an amazing Bacterio-cidal effect without human toxicity . It 's immediate administration showed immediate dramatic results solving problems that previously were fatal . Although initially enormously expensive to culture , within 3 years , the price had fallen at least two orders of magnitude , and within 10 years , was not much more expensive then aspirin . Penicillin was also usable for an amazingly wide class of infections . Centoxin is a drug that is not passing FDA approval . It promised amazing results for Toxic shock , a rapidly fatal disease . It consumed enormous amounts of funding in testing and developement , However it works less then 1 in 5 times of administration and costs $ 2,000 per administration with no promise of any reduction in manufacturing cost . The drug thus costs $ 10,000 per useful case , and is implicated in a slight increase in mortality for some patients . I would not dare to compare the shuttle to Pennicillin , but to centoxin . pat

EDT THE PRESIDENT : Good afternoon . Please be seated . I want to say , first , how delighted I am to be here with Secretary Riley and with Senator Graham . The three of us served as governors together during the 1980s when we worked constantly on strategies to improve our schools , when we led often difficult and long efforts to upgrade the standards in American education and to improve the quality of instruction our children were receiving . There were no two governors whom I admired more during that period than the two who now stand on this stage with the Teacher of the Year . And I think both of them would join me in saying that , after all the testimony has been heard and all the bills have been passed and the funds have been raised and allocated , it all comes down to what happens between the teacher and the students in the classroom . That 's why today 's ceremony honoring the National Teacher of the Year is so important . Tracey Leon Bailey is one recognition all across our country for highly advanced and innovative science programs . He 's developed and introduced into Florida 's classrooms cutting-edge programs in molecular biology and DNA fingerprinting -- subjects usually taught only in college and , I might add , probably only dimly understood here in the Nation 's Capital . ( Laughter . ) Within three years of being hired by a satellite high school , Mr. Bailey 's institution had one of the strongest science programs in the entire state of Florida , and it won numerous national and international awards . These advanced programs are n't just for a favored few . Tracey Bailey has inspired all kinds of students , including those previously known as low-achieving or at-risk to reach for excellence and to attain it . This is what our students need and what our country needs . Today , we know that a good future with high wages and rich opportunities rests on the foundation of quality education for a lifetime . The basics are n't enough anymore . All our kids need competence in math and science and advanced problem-solving . That 's why Tracey Bailey 's accomplishments are so important and why I am so pleased and proud to participate in recognizing and honoring these accomplishments . Tracey , you represent the best in the United States . I 'm glad to recognize you today and to formally present you with this Apple Award as the Teacher of the Year for 1993 . ( Applause . ) MR. BAILEY : Thank you , Mr. President . It is indeed a great honor and a tremendous responsibility to represent the nation 's 2.5 million teachers . And we appreciate the support that you have shown for education , and we 're looking forward to working with you to help redesign and improve our nation 's schools . We know that the quality of our children 's education will directly impact the future of our economic and social landscape in the years to come . And we thank you so much for your continued support and commitment to our children 's education . Thank you again . ( Applause . ) THE PRESIDENT : In closing , I would like to also welcome the education leaders in Florida who are here , those representing the national education groups who have also come . I 'd like to recognize Tracey 's congressman , Representative Jim Bacchus in the back , himself a great advocate of education . And I 'd like to remind all of you that the ultimate purpose of the National Teacher of the Year Award is to find a way for the rest of us to express our appreciation to people all across this country who give their lives to our children , all of the teachers of this country who get up every day and do their best to try to advance the cause of learning for all the children of America . They are , in so many ways , our most important public servants . Thank you very much . ( Applause . ) END1:29 P.M. EDT

First of all , it is a knee-jerk judgement . The facts are quite muddled at this point and will likely be for quite a while . Secondly , things do not improve by pointing blame and accusatory fingers . Pointing fingers is a destructive action . If everyone sat around pointing fingers all the time , nothing would get done and nothing would ever get any better . And despite the tragedy , we can learn something from this - if it is approached in a constructive manner . Does n't it seem that working together is more productive than working against one another ? Thirdly , it seems incredibly hypocritical to place blame given the benefit of hindsight - something that those who made the decisions did not have the benefit of . Why not give them the courtesy of acknowledging that they did the best they could with the data they had - in a very , very difficult situation . Some responses have gone so far to suggest that the actions were done without regard for the lives of the people in the compound - give me a break . Be part of the solution - not the problem .

'' A summary of the findings : Over the 5 year period , sac-fly type fly balls were produced 17.6 percent of the time in situations where a sac fly was useful , and 17.7 percent of the time when a sac fly was n't useful . They looked at the leaders in sac flies , and found that the leaders in sac flies - in other words , the guys you would expect to be good at it it - hit sac fly type fly balls only 3 % more often when they needed to - a difference way too small to be the result of a skill . Essentially , the players who hit a lot of sac flies seem to do so because they hit hit sac fly type flies often , with and without a runner on third . STATS concludes `` So it appears conclusive that hitters can not hit sacrifice flies on purpose - even if they practice in the bATTING cage . '' gREG

Those > who are familiar with Directory Opus on the Amiga know what I'm > looking for . Well , a few things might help you like the 3.1 File Manager better . 1 ) To get more than one window simply double click on a drive icon . That it only gives you one window to work with is a fallacy . You can drag files between windows , to any icon on the tree on the left side of the window , and to any drive icon . This beats your `` left and right window '' as you can have as many open as you wish instead of just two . 2 ) You can launch any app from within File Manager by double clicking on the executable 's icon . 3 ) You can launch any application and open a document file by double clicking on the document file 's icon , provided you have associations set correctly . This is easily done with the menus . The `` browse '' capability adds a lot of functionality to 3.1 . So if you name all your text files with .txt and point all GIF , TIFF , etc . files towards Paintshop or WinGIF , this takes care of your requirement for `` text reading and graphics viewing '' . I know someone who prefers using File Manager as his shell . Setting up all the associations you need is the way to do it . If Directory Opus is half as good as File Manager then it must be pretty good indeed ! File Manager just needs you to understand how some things are done . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Iskandar Taib | The only thing worse than Peach ala Internet : NTAIB @ SILVER.UCS.INDIANA.EDU | Frog is Frog ala Peach Bitnet : NTAIB @ IUBACS !

I 'm glad we ( MS ) are starting to remedy this situation with DOS 6 ( and it will get better in future releases ) . You do need to be aware of some history , however . In the mid-late 80 's , MS 's point of view was that OS/2 was going to take over the world and DOS would be phased out . As such , resources for DOS ( and windows , for that matter ) development were mostly redirected to OS/2 . The theory was to keep just enough resources on DOS to support people until they started using OS/2 , so utilities and such for DOS fell by the wayside . Then Windows 3.0 hit the market , OS/2 flopped ( 1.x , at least ... 2.x seems to be doing a little better , but its future is still cloudy ) , and people either stayed with their DOS ( 3.x and 4.x ) apps or moved to Windows . About that point in time , MS made its decision to drop OS/2 for DOS/Windows in the short term and Windows/NT in the long term . DOS 5 , much improved over DOS 3.x and 4.x , was the first result of MS 's refocussing on DOS and Windows .

Like I said before , I can understand why non-Christians would be denied *access* to holy ceremonies , but the ceremony itself ( communion ) was not secret . In fact , all four gospels record the first `` breaking of the bread '' in some detail . Communion was a fellowship meal , and it was ( and still should be , in my opinion ) inappropriate to invite those who did not share in the fellowship of the Body of Christ . The fact that unbelievers , denied access to these communal meals , began to imagine all sorts of secret and debased rituals during communion does not by any means imply that the early Christians were in fact hiding shameful things from the general public . In fact , I think if you read some of the early church fathers , you will find that they were not at all bashful about describing what went on during communion . That 's why it seems funny to me when Mormons , who claim to be the only true restoration of 1st century Christianity , insist on hiding certain rituals on the grounds that they are `` too sacred . '' - Mark [ Actually , that 's not quite the case . John omits the central elements of the Last Supper . His Gospel is full of symbolism of bread and wine . But the actual story is n't there . Some people think he has omitted some of the details because they were not talked about in public in his community . There is also evidence that some aspects of baptismal practice were kept secret . See Morton Smith 's `` Secret Gospel '' -- I do n't agree with his lurid speculations on what the secret practices actually were , but there does seem to be some evidence that Mark omitted certain details because they were inappropriate for publication . -- clh ]

There is no doubt that we have here two editions of the same text ; and as that of De Sacramentis is localised in Upper Italy and dated about the year 400 , it is the most ancient witness we possess as to the principal parts of the Roman canon , which only appear in the Sacramentaries some time after the seventh century . The question as to whether the Roman canon is not older even than that of De Sacramentis is discussed by liturgiologists . Mgr . Batiffol is of this opinion , but we , on the contrary , think that the former bears traces of closer composition , of a more carefully guarded orthodoxy , and that consequently it is a text corrected from De Sacramentis . We shall see , in studying the list of names in the Memento of the living and that of the dead , that Mgr . Batiffol argues with good reason that he can date these fragments from the pontificate of Symmachus ( 498-514 ) . We thus have the state of the Roman Mass , or at least of the chief parts of the canon , at the beginning of the fourth century .

( Sorry about double posting , but I forgot something . ) `` make , use or sell '' in this context have non-standard meanings : '' Make '' means making an encrypted message . `` Use '' may mean using PGP , or using an encrypted message . `` Sell '' would probably mean selling an encrypted message .

I guess we all know better now . > People dumb enough to give their money and possessions to a guy who says he's > jesus deserve all they get Really ? That 's interesting , as I was always of the opinion that people dumb enough to keep a monarchy around and support them with tax funds when said monarchy is merely a figurehead deserve all that they get . Dunkirk , for example . What ? That has nothing to do with it ? Then enjoy your helping of foot . > Anyway , he killed a few feds And they killed a few people of their own , including one child at last report . So what ? Being a federal agent is not license to kill . Then there 's CNN indicating that the ATF/FBI actually *DID* start the fires which would mean feds killed just under 100 people .

Not exactly correct , but nice try . The Catholic doctrine of infallibility refers to freedom from error in teaching of the universal Church in matters of faith or MORALS . It is this teaching which is taken as doctrine . -- Randal Lee Nicholas Mandock Catechist gt7122b @ prism.gatech.edu
