I think he could have gone back to Arizona St. for one more year if he hadn't signed . Anyhow , the Braves did try to send him to Richmond once ; it lead to a week-long walkout .

The US has been running on debt for the past four generations and has still financed what it pleases . And after the Gulf War , Israel could do whatever it wanted after not decimating Iraq after the Scud attacks . It was encouraged , but by no means forced , to negotiate . Mr. Baker , to address all of your points would be impossible , but in a nutshell , it is hypocritical for you to attack Israel 's presence in Lebanon without attacking Syria . Syrian occupation has been hostile , and amounts to annexation . Israel 's is clearly defensive . If it were not defensive , you would see all of Lebanon occupied , and governed by Israel .

Brian K. , I am pleased with your honesty . And to be honest as well , I believe you have not asked my god to come to you . Why do I say this ? Because by the things you write on the net , and the manner with which you write them , you show me that you made up your own god and are attempting to pass him off as the real thing .

And > if I decide to believe for no good reason , why not believe in some > other god ? Zeus seems like a pretty cool candidate ... I am sorry Brian , but when I read your postings , I do not see an open mind . What I do see is misunderstanding , lack of knowledge , arrogance and mockery . > Please tell me what more I can do while still remaining true to myself . Be true to yourself then . Have an open mind . And so end the mockery . Gain knowledge of the real God . Put your presumptions aside . Read the Bible and know that there is , truly is , a reason for everything and there exists a God that has so much love for you that the depth of it goes beyond our shallow worldly experience . A person who commits himself to seeking God , will find God . Jesus stands at your door and knocks . But a person who half-heartedly opens the Bible , or opens it with purpose to find something to mock , will find , learn and see nothing . The only thing one will gain with that attitude is folly . Be careful to not jump the gun , for at first glance , there are many passages in the Bible that will seem bizarre and absurd . Be assured that even though they seem alien at first , be confident that they are not . Be assured that beyond your present comprehension , there lies such deep reasons that once you see them , you will indeed be satisfied . I will personally guarantee that one . As Jesus put it , `` You will never be thirsty again . Your cup will even flow over . '' From King Solomon ( 970 B.C . to 930 B.C . ) : `` It is the glory of God to conceal a matter ; to search out a matter is the glory of kings . '' Jesus says in John 6:44 & 55 : `` No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him . '' And in John 3:16 : `` For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son , that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life . '' You are included in `` whosoever '' . And I also pray that the Father is drawing you , which it seems He is doing else you would n't be posting to talk.religion.misc . Remember Brian , you could be a St. Paul in the making . Paul not only mocked Christians as you do , but also had pleasure stoning them . Yet God showed him mercy , saved him , and Paul became on of the most celebrated men in the history of God 's church . You see Brian , I myself better be careful and not judge you , because you could indeed be the next Paul . For with the fervor that you attack Christians , one day you might find yourself one , and like Paul , proclaim the good news of Jesus with that very same fervor or more . Or you could be the next Peter . What Jesus said to Peter , Jesus would probably say to you : `` Satan would surely like to have you . '' Why so ? Because Peter was hard-headed , cynical and demonstrated great moments of stupidity , but once Peter committed himself to a task he did with full heart . Peter was the only apostle to have the faith to walk on water as Jesus did . You asked `` Why not believe in Zeus ? '' Zeus did n't offer eternal life . You got nothing to gain by believing in Zeus . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Brian Ceccarelli brian @ gamma1.lpl.arizona.edu

Here again , the problem with most of the individuals posting here , you take the biblical account as though it were some sort of historical recounting in the modern sense . I would refer you to John Dominic Crossans Book _The Cross That Spoke_ ( Pub . Harper and Row , 1988 ) . The earliest texts which we have make no reference to an empty tomb . Nor is an empty tomb necessary for a claim of resurrection . Modern Evangelicals/Fundamentalists have completely missed what the point of resurrection is -- Here the work of George Nickelsburg 's work _Resurrection , Immortality , and Eternal Life in Intertestamental Judaism_ ( Publ Cambridge , Havard Univ . Press , 1972 ) is most helpful . Look At Rom 1:1-3 . Paul here has no need of an empty tomb . Additionally in 1 Cor 15 , Here again there is no mention of an empty tomb . He was raised ( note the passive ) , he appeared , no ascension either . Resurrection could be accomplished without ever disturbing the bones in the grave . The whole idea of an empty tomb is n't broached in any of our texts until well after the fall of Jerusalem . By that time , the idea of coming up with a body would have been ludicrious . Moreover Mack has argued ( convicingly , I think ) that the empty tomb story first appears in Mark ( we have no texts before this which mention the tomb ) . > > Now , you say that you think that the disciples stole the body . But think on > this a moment . Would you die to maintain something you KNEW to be a > deliberate lie ! ? If not , then why do you think the disciples would ! ?

Even the Idea of a subjective mystical event as the foundation of the resurrection narratives is currently becoming more untenable . See B. Mack _A Myth of Innocence_ . randy

From : operator @ mast.mast.queensu.ca ( Me ) Subject : Vanishing font problem ... . Organization : Department of Mathematics , Queen 's University at Kingston Lines : 25 A colleague has a bizarre font problem on his new MIPS workstation . When he first logs on ( via xdm ) , he has a single xterm window appear with the mwm window manager running . In this configuration , X windows applications ( particularly xdvi ) work fine . However , if he opens up a second xterm application , suddenly xdvi can not start in either window , giving the error : Unable to load ISO 8859-1 font . The only difference between the two xterm windows is that the initial one references a different name in the Xsession file , with prettier colours and other slight changes . Further investigation shows that only opening a default xterm causes this behaviour , and more significant , ALL X applications can no longer load any fonts if they are invoked from the command line in either window . If I start the xterm with a different font ( using the -fn option ) , no problems . It would seem that the default xterm is loading a font which somehow causes the server to lose all of its fonts . Note : xlsfonts in either window shows all of the fonts available , so there does n't appear to be a problem in the font directories/hash-tables . Other than rewriting the XTerm app-defaults file to use a different font and hope for the best , does anyone have any ideas ? More info : This is the most recent MIPS workstation ( R4000 I believe ) , with the most current operating system and running X11R5 . It is not mwm 's fault , as the same problems occur under twm , etc .

The jealousy does not technically exist until the object is apparent . However , the capacity to be jealous is presumably still there even though it is not detectable . Your description of the Unbilical took me three passes to understand ( ! ) but I get the gist and I have to tentatively agree . I think our two definitions can sit side by side without too much trouble , though . I have n't attempted to define the reason behind the Moral Driver ( only hinted through the essence of each Moral ) . Your definition hints that animals are also capable of a similar morality - Simians have a similar Social Order to ourselves and it is easy to anthropomorphize with these animals .

I have no particular plan ( except to do my bit - personal ethics AND social work ) . My opinion ( for what it is worth ) is that the Authority for each Moral must be increased somehow , and that this will probably take several generations to be effective . I do n't think that the list of Morals has changed for Society significantly , though . The Authority element may come from our authority figures and roles models ( see Eric Berne and his transactional analysis work [ + Mavis Klein ] for references ) and this is what gives rise to a deterioration of moral standards in the long term . I 've had some more thoughts on my definitions : I 've was thinking that I should add Moral Character to the list of definitions in order to get a dynamic version of the Moral Nature ( ie . the interplay of the Moral Code and associated Authorities ) . A suitable analogy might be a graphic equaliser on a HiFi system - the Moral Nature being the set of frequencies and the chosen 'amplitudes ' , and the Moral Character being the spectrum over time . Conscience is a little more difficult because I ca n't define it as the reasoning of a person between actions in the context of his Moral Nature because Conscience seems to cut in most of the time unbidden and often unwanted . I think Conscience is manifest when a decision is made at a given time which compromises one 's Moral Nature . My Conscience fits in more with Freud 's SuperEgo ( plus the Moral Driver ) with the stimulous being the urges or Freud 's Id . The reasoning that I mentioned before is Freud 's Ego , I suppose . If the Moral Driver is part of the Id then the reason why Conscience cuts in unbidden is partially explained . The question is `` what provides the stimulous to activate the Moral driver ? '' . I think I need some more time with this one . That 's about it for now ! David . -- - On religion : '' Oh , where is the sea ? `` , the fishes cried , As they swam its clearness through .

My problem is this . My system only had a IDE cable for one drive , so I had to buy cable with two drive connectors on it , and consequently have to switch cables . The problem is , the new hard drive 's manual refers to matching pin 1 on the cable with both pin 1 on the drive itself and pin 1 on the IDE card . But for the life of me I can not figure out how to tell which way to plug in the cable to align these . Secondly , the cable has like a connector at two ends and one between them . I figure one end goes in the controler and then the other two go into the drives . Does it matter which I plug into the `` master '' drive and which into the `` Slave '' ? any help appreciated . thanks ...

I have no particular desire > to post it yet again . > > Brendan . > ( normally bdm @ cs.anu.edu.au ) You apparently think you are some sort of one-man judge and jury who can declare `` total '' victory and then sit back and enjoy the applause . But you 've picked the wrong topic if you think a few rigged `` quotations '' can sustain the legend and lie of the Deir Yassin `` massacre . '' You have a lot to learn when it comes to historical methodology . At the most basic level , you should know that there is a big difference between weighing evidence fairly and merely finding '' quotations '' that support your preset opinions . If you have studied the history of Israel at all you must know that many of the sources of your `` quotations '' have an axe to grind , and therefore you must be very careful about whom you `` quote . '' For example , Meir Pa'il , whom you cite , was indeed a general , a scholar , and a war hero . But that does n't mean everything that comes out of his mouth is gold . In fact ( and here your lack of experience shows ) , Pa'il is such a fanatic , embittered leftist that much of his anti-Israel blathering ( forget about anti-Irgun blathering ) would be considered something like treason in non-Israel contexts . But of course you do n't consider this AT ALL when you find a juicy '' quotation '' that you can use to attack Israel . Benny Morris ( of Hashomer Hatzair ) represents himself as a `` scholar '' when he rehashes the old attacks on the Irgun . Do n't be fooled . It 's just the old Zionist ideological catfight , surfacing as an attack on the ( then- ) Likud government . If you will look closely at the section on Deir Yassin in his book on the War of Independence , you will see his `` indictment '' to be pure hot air . And this is the BEST HE CAN DO after decades of digging for any sort of damning evidence . Unfortunately for him , because his book parades itself as '' scholarly , '' he is forced to put footnotes . So you can clearly see that his Deir Yassin account is based on nothing . The Deir Yassin `` massacre '' never took place as the propagandists tell it , any more than the Sabra and Shatila `` massacres . '' Do you get the feeling people like to blame the Jews for `` massacres , '' even if they have to make them up ? It must sound spicy . Even some Jews like to do it , for reasons of their own . Please , do n't confuse any of you Deir Yassin `` massacre '' stuff with facts or scholarship . You should stick to Begin 's version unless you find something serious to contradict it . Vic

This argument of yours regarding the certainty of an observation or a conclusion is not necessarily substantiated by experience . It reminds me of the theoretical physicist who said that you can never be certain of a measurment because the sensor interferes with the field you are trying to measure . Now , the experimental physicist will reply that although the measurement can never be made with absolute certainty , he is able to determine the certainty with which the measurement can be made , and this knowledge is often sufficient to render the measurement useful enough to allow evidence of the true condition of the field under observation . Therefore , although our minds are finite and susceptible to error , our competence in arriving at inductive insights gives confidence in our ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true , even in areas not subject to the experimental method . ?

Its very hard on meters ( and electricians ) when you put the milliamp shunt across a 600 volt bus . But that 's not why we stopped buying Beckmans - after a while a lot of them got `` funny '' in the LCD display . A black stain would spread from one edge , or else they 'd come adrift from those Zebra connectors and fail to operate . Now we buy Flukes , the low-end 20 series mostly ( and we still fill the amp jack with silicone ) . What the world needs is a meter that wo n't let you change ranges or turn it on/off with a lead stuck in the amps jack - a little bit of clever plastic detailing would take care of this and make the world safer for electricans , anyway . Not that I 've ever put a meter on the wrong range into a live circuit , no , not me ... not more than a dozen times , anyway ... .

From : scst83 @ csc.liv.ac.uk ( Mr. C.D . Smith ) Subject : Voltage Multiplier Problem . Organization : Computer Science , Liverpool University Lines : 53 Nntp-Posting-Host : goyt.csc.liv.ac.uk Hi , I 've just built a valve preamp and use a diode/capacitor voltage multiplier to step the 12vAC supply voltage up to approx 260vDV . As the load resistance increases , the RC constant decreases and hence the output voltage drops . I need as high an output voltage as possible . ( about 260v ) . The circuit consists of seven voltage multiplier stages ( ie 14 diodes and 14 capacitors ) each capacitor develops about 38v across them , and I take the output from across seven capacitors=260v . Each capacitor is 100mfd at 68v . If I increase each of the capacitors rating ( 220-470mfd ) , that will increase the RC constant , and hence alleviate some of the problem . These capacitors are going to be a little expensive as I need 14 of them , So : 1 . What would happen if I connected a 470mfd at 400v capacitor in parallel with the output ( and hence in parallel with the seven 100mfd capacitors ) ? Will it , as I assume , increase the C in circuit and hence increase the RC time constant ? If it does , and my output voltage becomes more stable by doing this , then I will have killed two birds with one stone ... as I am experiencing some 50Hz ripple ( and hence amp hum ) , and this new capacitor will 'smooth ' this out . and 2 . Can anyone recomend a suitable value for an inductor ( choke ) to be placed in the output line of the power supply to filter out the 50Hz mains hum . Lowest resistance possible ! I 've not got my preamp with me at the moment because it is TOO MUCH of a distraction ... . ( I 'm at university and I 've got to get my dissertation finished in two weeks ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ) hence I 'm mailing not playing with my solderoing iron ( it 'll be cheaper too in the long run ... especially if 14 new large capacitors do n't work as planned ! ) Email please ... .

Certainly it turns up repeatedly in basic > phil . of sci . texts as an example of the inventive component of > hypothesizing . And has been rather thoroughly demolished as myth by Robert Scott Root- Bernstein . See his book , `` Discovering '' . Ring structures for benzene had been proposed before Kekule ' , after him , and at the same time as him . The current models do not resemble Kekule 's . Many of the predecessors of Kekule 's structure resemble the modern model more . I do n't think `` extra-scientific '' is a very useful phrase in a discussion of the boundaries of science , except as a proposed definiens . Extra-rational is a better phrase . In fact , there are quite a number of well-known cases of extra-rational considerations driving science in a useful direction . For example , Pasteur discovered that racemic acid was a mixture of enantiomers ( the origin of stereochemistry ) partly because he liked a friend 's crank theory of chemical action . The friend was wrong , but Pasteur 's discovery stood . A prior investigator ( Mitscherlich ) , looking at the same phenomenon , had missed a crucial detail ; presumably because he lacked Pasteur 's motivation to find something that distinguished racemic acid from tartaric ( now we say : d-tartaric ) acid . Again , Pasteur discovered the differential fermentation of enantiomers ( tartaric acid again ) not because of some rational conviction , but because he was trying to produce yeast that lived on l-tartaric acid . His notebooks contained fantasies of becoming the `` Newton of mirror-image life , '' which he never admitted publically . Perhaps the best example is the discovery that DNA carries genes . Avery started this work because of one of his students , and ardent Anglophile and Francophobe Canadian , defended Fred Griffiths ' discoveries in mice . Most of Griffiths ' critics were French , which decided the issue for the student . Avery told him to replicate Griffiths ' work in vitro , which the student eventually did , whereupon Avery was convinced and started the research program which , in 15 or so years , produced the famous discovery ( Avery , MacLeod , and McCarty , JEM 1944 ) . -- Mark A.

It would have the plus of RocketShare and the minus of NuBus accelerators - no true boot off the accelerator , NuBus bottleneck to video and other I/O . Apple , it seems , will not compete with third parties here -- except perhaps for not-yet-available Macs like Cyclone , where a PowerPC slot might be advertised . Look for Daystar and such to make PowerPC accelerators . One potential problem with any accelerator , though , is that it will need a ROM companion and Apple has licensed only Radius , with Rocketshare , to use any of its proprietary code . Apple is , between the lines , trying to let us know that PowerPC Macs will have simplified logic boards due to the magical nature of RISC and that these boards should be much cheaper to build than those in existing 68040 Macs . Perhaps , then , we 'll see groundbreaking prices in Mac-logic board upgrades , much the same way we 've seen much cheaper high-performance CPUs this year . First generation PowerPCs , 98601s , will also hopefully have socketed CPUs so that they 'll be chip upgradeable to 98604s a year later . This should be possible in much the same way that 486s can be pulled for clock doublers . If there is too much technical baggage ( which I doubt since the external busses are the same size/width ) to do this , perhaps we can have CPU daughterboard , a la Powerbook , as standard to facilitate better CPU upgrades . This is an area where Apple has fallen far behing the Intel-based world . Perhaps catchup is in order . By the way , last week 's PC week had an excellent story on PowerPC , Pentium , MIPS R4000 , DEC Alpha ( the big four on the microprocessor front for the forseeable future ) . Worth reading for technojunkies . Also , the latest PC has a cover story on Pentium . Read it , and all the other stories about how Intel is unstoppable and preeminent right now . Once anyone is this secure , they are due to fall . Intel 's market position will never again be as dominant as it is today ( especially if AMD gets the go ahead to sell its 486s this week as it appears it might ) . The competition from all fronts is gearing up for an awesome battle .

I am curious to find > out the required bandwidth that a link must have if one machine running > DV/X is supporting multiple users ( clients ) and we require adequate response > time . Anyone have any ideas ? ? I expect the limiting factor will be your server machine , not the network itself . To give you a real-world example , here at Quarterdeck we have roughly 100 people using DVX to talk to a bunch of unix boxes , novell file servers , and each other . It 's not _too_ much of a load on our Ethernet ( with maybe 4 concentrators , so you have 20-30 people on each segment ) . If you had a badly loaded net , or the apps you wanted to run were very network intensive , you could run into some slowdowns . But the biggest problem would be the machine itself . Say you have a 486 33 with plenty of ram and a fast hard disk and network card . If you have 10 people running programs off it , you 're going to see some slowdowns because you 're now on ( effectively ) a 3.3 MHz 486 . Of course , DVX will attempt to see if tasks are idle and make sure they give up their time slice , but if you have 10 working programs running , you 'll know it . Having said that , if you can tweak the programs being run ( by adding in calls to give up time slices when idle and that sort of thing ) , you could probably run 15-20 people on a given machine before you started seeing slowdowns again ( this time from network bandwidth ) . It all really depends on what the programs are doing ( ie . you 're going to see a slowdown from X-bandwidth a lot sooner if your apps are all doing network things also ... ) -- Quarterdeck Office Systems - Internet Support - Tom Bortels Pricing/Ordering : info @ qdeck.com | Tech Questions : support @ qdeck.com BBS : ( 310 ) 314-3227 * FAX : ( 310 ) 314-3217 * Compuserve : GO QUARTERDECK Q/Fax : ( 310 ) 314-3214 from touch-tone phone for Technotes On Demand !

From : jodfishe @ silver.ucs.indiana.edu ( joseph dale fisher ) Subject : Re : Sin Organization : Indiana University Lines : 22 Sorry for taking this off of Sharon 's resp , but I 'd also like to add some more verses to that and perhaps answer the second Q. Verses : 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 Colossians 3:5-10 As for knowing when , that 's a bit tricky . People normally have consciences which warn them about it . However , as in my case , a conscience can be hardened by sin 's deceitfulness ( Hebrews 3:12:13 ) so that the person has no idea ( or does n't care about it ) that they are sinning . Of course , there are those sins which we do when we do n't know that they 're sinful to begin with . Those take searching and examining of Scripture to find out that they are sinful and then repent and change . The best question to ask in every circumstance to judge sinful possibilities is : `` Would Jesus wholeheartedly do this at this point in time ? '' I know , it sounds like a cop-out , but it truly is a stifling question . Joe Fisher Oh , I missed one . 1 John 1:8-2:11,15-23 .

I 've never had problems and I know : numerous people that are still using the original battery in there : 8-10 year old beemers . THe original battery in an 8-10 year old BMW may be fine . Mine lasted many years . The replacement 30AH battery from BMW was a disaster . The mechanic from Comp . Acc . told me that CA would warantee replace the bad one with a new one of the same evil bad batteries and tell the customer if they have problems to bring it back and they 'd do it again . It seems that many of those 30AH batteries were DOA , near-DOA , and always unlikely to be going strong by the end of the warantee period on them . THere was a big batch of bad ones , and they replaced them with -you guessed it - more bad ones . BMW switched to a 25AH battery that has more cold cranking amps , even if it has less total juice . I switched to a YUASA that has even more cold cranking amps and cost one third fewer dollars .

Of course , if you 're a criminal , or hang around with criminals , or flash large wads of cash in the wilder parts of town , or utter verbal bigotry in the right public places , your chances of being shot are much higher . Avoiding these behaviors , on the other hand , decreases your chances of being shot . Something like 60 % of all murders are criminals killing criminals .

Possibly you punched in the wrong numbers on your calculator . 256 color modes take a byte per pixel so 640 time 480 is 307,200 which is 300k to be exact . 640x400x256 only takes 250k but I do n't think it is a BIOS mode . I would n't bet that all VGA cards can do that either . If a VGA card has 512k I bet it can do both 640x400 and 640x480 . That by definition is SVGA , though not very high SVGA .
From : molnar @ Bisco.CAnet.CA ( Tom Molnar ) Subject : sudden numbness in arm Organization : UTCC Lines : 30 I experienced a sudden numbness in my left arm this morning . Just after I completed my 4th set of deep squats . Today was my weight training day and I was just beginning my routine . All of a sudden at the end of the 4th set my arm felt like it had gone to sleep . It was cold , turned pale , and lost 60 % of its strength . The weight I used for squats was n't that heavy , I was working hard but not at 100 % effort . I waited for a few minutes , trying to shake the arm back to life and then continued with chest exercises ( flyes ) with lighter dumbells than I normally use . But I dropped the left dumbell during the first set , and experienced continued arm weakness into the second . So I quit training and decided not to do my usual hour on the ski machine either . I 'll take it easy for the rest of the day . My arm is *still* somewhat numb and significantly weaker than normal -- my hand still tingles a bit down to the thumb . Color has returned to normal and it is no longer cold . Horrid thoughts of chunks of plaque blocking a major artery course through my brain . I 'm 34 , vegetarian , and pretty fit from my daily exercise regimen . So that ca n't be it . Could a pinched nerve from the bar cause these symptoms ( I hope ) ? Has this happened to anyone else ? Nothing like this has ever happened to me before . Does it come with age ? Thanks , Tom -- Tom Molnar Unix Systems Group , University of Toronto Computing & Communications .

The idea is commercialized in at least one product , the Private Eye . That 's a small cube-shaped device that the user straps around the head similar to a sweat band . There is a boom that comes from the side on which the device is mounted so that it is positioned in front of the user 's eye . The Private Eye we had here for evaluation was Hercules-MDA compatible . The innards are a row ( ~400 LEDs ) that are swept up and down by a galvonometer-like movement . The result is that the sweeping LED bar forms a fused raster . There is a virtual image projected in front of the user that the visual system tends to fuse with the background . I did n't like the device very much . I found it easiest to use if I looked at a blank white wall . I had problems with focus tracking if I glanced down to look at my keyboard for an out-of-the-way key .

While I applaud investing of money in Yehuda , Shomron , v'Chevel-Azza , in order to create jobs for their residents , I find it deplorable that this has never been an active policy of any Israeli administration since 1967 , *with regard to their Jewish residents* . Past governments found funds to subsidize cheap ( read : affordable ) housing and the requisite infrastructure , but where was the investment for creating industry ( which would have generated income *and* jobs ) ? After 26 years , Yehuda and Shomron remain barren , bereft of even middle-sized industries , and the Jewish settlements are sterile '' bedroom communities '' , havens for ( in the main ) Israelis ( both secular *and* religious ) who work in Tel-Aviv or Jerusalem but can not afford to live in either city or their surrounding suburbs . There 's an old saying : `` bli giboosh , ayn kivoosh '' -- just living there was n't enough , we had to *really* settle it .

The manual transmission keeps the drive always doing something , granted it is n't a large movement . Plus , driving should be FUN ! Driving a manual is fun , driving an automatic is a chore .

OK , you guys stirred up my childhood memories , so I went and did some research on the final month or so of the 1964 season . It turns out that my recollections were pretty darn accurate , at least as far as the Phillies record goes . On September 1 1964 this was the top of the N.L . standings : W L GB Philadelphia 79 51 - Cincinnati 74 57 5 1/2 St. Louis 72 59 7 1/2 San Francisco 73 60 7 1/2 This is a game-by-game description of the remainder of the Phillies' season : Date Score Opponent Lead Pitcher ( starting and winner/loser ) 9/1 4-3 Houston 5 1/2 Bunning ( 15-4 ) 9/2 2-1 Houston 5 1/2 Short ( 15-7 ) 9/3 0-6 Houston 5 1/2 Bennett ( 9-12 ) 9/4 5-3 San Francisco 6 1/2 Mahaffey ; Baldschun ( 6-5 ) 9/5 ? ?

But now it all falls apart ... 9/21 0-1 Cincinnati 5 1/2 Mahaffey ( 12-9 ) ( Reds take sole possesion of 2nd place ) 9/22 2-9 Cincinnati 4 1/2 Short ( 17-8 ) 9/23 4-6 Cincinnati 3 1/2 Bennett ( 12-13 ) 9/24 3-5 Milwaukee 3 Bunning ( 18-6 ) 9/25 5-7/12 Milwaukee 1 1/2 Short ; Boozer ( 3-4 ) ( Cards now 2 1/2 back in 3rd , Giants 3 1/2 in 4th ) 9/26 4-6 Milwaukee 1/2 Mahaffey ; Schantz ( 2-5 ) 9/27 8-14 Milwaukee -1 Bunning ( 18-7 ) ( Phils lose 7 1/2 games in 7 days ; Reds take over 1st , Cardinals 1 1/2 back in 3rd ) 9/28 1-5 St. Louis -1 1/2 Short ( 17-9 ) ( Cardinals take over 2nd place , Phils drop to 3rd ) 9/29 2-4 St. Louis -1 1/2 Bennett ( 12-14 ) ( Reds and Cardinals now tied for 1st ) 9/30 5-8 St. Louis -2 1/2 Bunning ( 18-8 ) ( Cardinals take 1/2 game lead over Reds ) 10/1 4-3 Cincinnati -1 1/2 Short ; Roebuck ( 5-3 ) ( Phillies halt 10-game losing streak ; Cards lead Reds by 1/2 game ) 10/2 Did not play ; Cards lose to Mets , Reds tied for 1st , Phils 1 game back 10/3 10-0 Cincinnati -1 Bunning ( 19-8 ) ( Cards beat Mets , take first by 1 from Reds and Phillies ) Whew ! what a finish ! And the final standings were : W L GB St. Louis 93 69 - Philadelphia 92 70 1 Cincinnati 92 70 1 San Francisco 90 72 3 Now it does n't appear to me that Phillies pitchers Bunning and Short were really overused , at least by the four-man rotation standard of the day , until well along into the 10-game losing streak , at which time Mauch was probably desperate for a win at any cost because the Phillies substantial lead had evaporated . The way they were used at that time may have made the problem worse , although Bunning had one of his sharpest games of the year in the final day 10-0 shutout of the Reds that cost the Reds a share of the pennant . Bunning pitched a complete game six-hitter , striking out five and walking one . It would be inetersting to see , though , how the total innings for the year for Bunning and Short stacks up against the rest of the league . Also notice that the Phillies played every day from at least September 1 through October 1 ; while they did n't play substantially more games than the other teams , the other teams each had a couple days off during that stretch . -- -- - Eric Smith erics @ netcom.com erics @ infoserv.com CI $ : 70262,3610

However , the Mac SE can not DISPLAY grayscale on The original poster ( W G Wright ) posted an item saying that he had bought a new wizz-bang Laser Printer from Apple ( a Select 300 I think ) which can print GrayScale . He then said that he CAN NOT PRINT GRAYSCALE from his SE computer ( and also that all the 'experts ' he has dealt with agree that it is not possible ) . This is the one major bugbear about doing a 3rd party SE upgrade ( compared to Apple 's SE to SE/30 upgrade ) : you will never be able to run Color Quickdraw . It is Color Quickdraw that controls Color AND Grayscale . SEs CAN print some COLOUR : this is because Quickdraw - the original , non-colour version , has the right hooks for eight colours . Some of you will remember the 'SCSIgraph ' solution to getting a colour screen for your SE ( I think that it gave you sixteen colours by dithering or something ) . There is no reason that Apple could n't release software patches for older computers ( there are lots of Mac Pluses , Classics and SEs that have been upgraded to 68020 and 68030 processors which should be perfectly able to deal with Color Quickdraw ) - but they wont , and 3rd parties are having a difficult time in duplicating the Mac 's ROMs ( i.e . Nutek et al. ) . Just one Caveat : I would have thought that if you were printing a POSTSCRIPT Grayscale image onto a POSTSCRIPT Grayscale printer , that you would be able to do so , whatever Mac you were using . ( And I am pretty sure that the Select 300 is NOT a POSTSCRIPT printer [ ? correct me if I 'm wrong ? ] ) . Phil Ryan Melbourne , Australia

Some other owners on the ford-probe @ world.std.com mailing list have commented about this problem , but I have n't seen it happen on my 3 month old '93 Probe GT . I think this may be something that Ford has corrected since the initial batch of cars . Also , someone said that Ford has issued a service bulletin to inform dealers about how to correct this problem , so you may be able to get your dealer to fix it . > Headlights have `` stuck '' up a few times ( weather ? ) > air conditioning broke ~4000 miles ( pressure cycling switch ) > condensation around rear washer fluid container does n't drain completely .

It 's pretty much takes up all the space where you 'd expect to find the horn . Speaking of the horn , I was surprised to find that the Probe comes with one of those nice 'merican sounding horns instead of the Japanese sounding kind .

I know that some of the very early Probes ( '89 and maybe '90 ) had problems with prematurely rusting mufflers ( which Ford will replace at no charge ) , but I have n't heard about anything like this concerning the '93 Probes . I have n't had any real trouble with this car outside of a CV joint boot that was leaking , but the dealer took care of that promptly , and even gave me a free rental car for the day and a half that I was without my car . I was quite happy with the way they handled ... especially considering that I was expecting the worst from them ! From what I 've heard , it sounds like Ford/Mazda had some QC problems with the Probe ( and probably MX-6 ) when they first went into production , but I think these problems have mostly been corrected at this point .

Actually , it is simple . A person P has committed a crime C in country X if P was within the borders of X at the time when C was committed . It does n't matter if the physical manifestation of C is outside X . For instance , if I hack into NASA 's Ames Research Lab and delete all their files , I have committed a crime in the United Kingdom . If the US authorities wish to prosecute me under US law rather than UK law , they have no automatic right to do so . This is why the net authorities in the US tried to put pressure on some sites in Holland . Holland had no anti-cracking legislation , and so it was viewed as a `` hacker haven '' by some US system administrators . Similarly , a company called Red Hot Television is broadcasting pornographic material which can be received in Britain . If they were broadcasting in Britain , they would be committing a crime . But they are not , they are broadcasting from Denmark , so the British Government is powerless to do anything about it , in spite of the apparent law-breaking . Of course , I 'm not a lawyer , so I could be wrong . More confusingly , I could be right in some countries but not in others ... mathew

From : nichael @ bbn.com ( Nichael Cramer ) Subject : Re : Some questions from a new Christian Reply-To : ncramer @ bbn.com Organization : BBN , Interzone Office Lines : 49 OFM responds to a query about reference works : [ Aside from a commentary , you might also want to consider an introduction . These are books intended for use in undergraduate Bible courses . They give historical background , discussion of literary styles , etc . And generally they have good bibligraphies for further reading . I typically recommend Kee , Froehlich and Young 's NT introduction ... Two other Intros to consider : The `` Introduction '' by Ku : mmel is a translation of a strandard NT text . The references are slightly dated and the style is somewhat dense , but the book contains a wealth of information . Perrin and Duling 's Intro is also very good . It 's somewhat more modern than Ku : mmel 's but not quite so densely packed . Also the authors tend to go through the books of the NT in the historical order of composition ; this gives a very useful perspective on the development of the NT . ... There are also some good one-volume commentaries . ... Probably the best recommendation these days would be Harper 's Bible Commentary . A slight dissent : I think the Harper 's is `` OK '' but not great . One particular problem I have is that it tends to be pretty skimpy on bibliographic material . My feeling is that it is OK for quick look-ups , but not real useful for study in depth ( e.g . I keep a copy in my office at work ) . ... ( I think there may be a couple of books with this title ... So far as I know there is the only one book with this exact title ( James L Mays , general editor , Harper and ROw , 1988 ) although I think I recall a ( older ) series under the name `` Harper Commentaries '' . Also there 's a separate Harper 's Bible Dictionary ( most of my comments on the HC also apply to the HBD . ) My favorite one-volume commentary is the `` New Jerome Biblical Commentary '' . The NJBC is rather Catholic in focus and somewhat biased towards the NT . ( The reader can decide for her- or himself whether these are pluses or minuses . ) In any case the scholarship is by and large excellent . NOTE : The NJBC is a completely reworked , updated version of the '' Jerome Biblical Commentary '' , copies of which can still be found on sale . Nichael

OpenGL is a graphics programming library and as such is a great , portable interface for the development of interactive 3D graphics applications . It is not , however , an indicator of performance , as that will vary strongly from machine to machine and vendor to vendor . SGI is committed to high performance interactive graphics systems and software tools , so OpenGL means that you can port easily from SGI to other platforms , there is no guarantee that your performance would be comparable . | > | > What I *am* annoyed about is the fact that we were led to believe that | > we *would* be able to upgrade to a multiprocessor version of the | > Crimson without the assistance of a fork lift truck . If your sales representative truly mislead you , then you should have a valid grievance against us which you should carry up to your local SGI sales management team .

As one of the previous posts stated , the Personal IRIS was introduced in 1988 and grew to include the 4D/20 , 4D/25 , 4D/30 and 4D/35 as clock rates sped up over time . As a rule of thumb , SGI platforms live for about 4-5 years . This was true of the motorola-based 3000 series ( '85-'89 ) , the PI ( '88-'93 ) , the Professional Series ( the early 4D 's - '86-'90 ) , the Power Series parallel systems ( '88-'93 ) . Individual CPU subsystems running at a particular clock rate usually live for about 2 years . New graphics architectures at the high end ( GT , VGX , RealityEngine ) are released every 18 months to 2 years . These are the facts of life . If we look at these machines , they become almost archaic after four years , and we have to come out with a new platform ( like Indigo , Onyx , Challenge ) which has higher bus bandwidths , faster CPUs , faster graphics and I/O , and larger disk capacities . If we do n't , we become uncompetitive . From the user perspective , you have to buy a machine that meets your current needs and makes economic sense today . You ca n't wait to buy , but if you need a guaranteed upgrade path for the machine , ask the Sales Rep for one in writing . If it 's feasible , they should be able to do that . Some of our upgrade paths have specific programs associated with them , such as the Performance Protection Program for older R3000-based Power Series multiprocessing systems which allowed purchasers of those systems to obtain a guaranteed upgrade price for moving to the new Onyx or Challenge R4400-based 64-bit multiprocessor systems . | > | > Now I understand that SGI is responsible to its investors and has to | > keep showing a positive quarterly bottom line ( odd that I found myself | > pressured on at least two occasions to get the business on the books | > just before the end of the quarter ) , but I 'm just a little tired of | > getting boned in the process . | > If that 's happening , it 's becausing of misunderstandings or mis-communication , not because SGI is directly attempting to annoy our customer base . | > Maybe it 's because my lab buys SGIs in onesies and twosies , so we | > are n't entitled to a `` peek under the covers '' as the Big Kids ( NASA , | > for instance ) are .

Most SGI customers are onesy-twosey types , but regardless , we rarely give a great deal of notice when we are about to introduce a new system because again , like a previous post stated , if we pre-announced and the schedule slipped , we would mess up our potential customers schedules ( when they were counting on the availability of the new systems on a particular date ) and would also look awfully bad to both our investors and the financial analysts who watch us most carefully to see if we are meeting our commitments . | > The boxes that we buy now will have to last us pretty much through the | > entire grant period of five years and , in some case , beyond .

New processor technologies are arriving every 1-2 years , making a 5 year old computer at least 2 and probably 3 generations behind the times . The competitive nature of the market is demanding that rate of development , so if your timing is really 5 years between purchases , you have to accept the limited viability of whatever architecture you buy into from any vendor .

From : darcym @ fpddet4.mentorg.com ( Darcy McCallum ) Subject : Keyboard mapping and window placement questions Nntp-Posting-Host : fpddet4.mentorg.com Organization : mentor Keywords : Lines : 27 These are two common subjects so I hope someone has had to deal with these specific questions . 1 . If my application depends on modifiers , what is the best lookup method ? My choices are to call XGetModifierMapping ( ) for each key press with a modifier , or make the call once at the init of the app and store the modifiers in a lookup table . I would like to do it the second way , but I ca n't seem to get the notify when the user uses xmodmap to remap the modifiers . I know that when an app calls XSetModifierMapping ( ) a MappingNotify event is generated ( non-maskable ) which I can pick up and modify my internal table . But , I don't seem to get any notify events when the user uses xmodmap . If I use Xt , all O'Reilly has to say is ' ... is automatically handled by Xt ... ' . If I use Xlib , ala XNextEvent ( ) , I get nothing . This all stems from problems with users of the Sun 4/5 keyboard and the NumLock ; plus various Alt/Meta/etc . modifier requirements . 2 . I would like to place a popup so that it will be to the immediate right of my main window . I want it at the same y coord , and their right/left sides touching . What I need to ask for is the x , y coord of the window manager 's border for the main window . This should ring a bell with anyone who has called XtMoveWidget ( ) , immediately checking the x , y after the move and seeing that it is right , and in their next callback asking for the x , y and seeing that it is now offset by the WM border . Any help would be most appreciated . Darcy darcy_mccallum @ mentorg.com

I will oblige . My name is Elias Davidsson , Icelandic citizen , born in Palestine . My mother was thrown from Germany because she belonged to the 'undesirables' ( at that times this group was defined as 'Jews ' ) . She was forced to go to Palestine due to many cynical factors . I have meanwhile settled in Iceland ( 30 years ago ) and met many people who were thrown out from my homeland , Palestine , because of the same reason ( they belonged to the 'indesirables ' ) . These people include my neighbors in Jerusalem with the children of whom I played as child . Their crime : Theyare not Jews . My conscience does not accept such injustice , period . My work for justice is done in the name of my principled opposition to racism and racial discrimination . Those who protest against such practices in Arab countries have my support - as long as their protest is based on a principled position , but not as a tactic to deflect criticism from Israel . The struggle against discrimination and racism is universal . The Center for Policy Research is a name I gave to those activities undertaken under my guidance in different domains , and which command the support of many volunteers in Iceland . It is however not a formal institution and works with minimal funds . Professionally I am music teacher and composer . I have published several pieces and my piano music is taught widely in Europe . I would hope that discussion about Israel/Palestine be conducted in a more civilized manner . Calling names is not helpful . Elias Davidsson ICELAND

The Seattle-based study showed that roughly one in eight emergency visits for asthma in that city was linked to exposure to particulate air pollution . The actual exposure levels recorded in the study were far below those deemed unsafe under federal air quality laws . `` People with asthma have inflamed airways , and airborne particles tend to exacerbate that inflammation , '' said Joel Schwartz , Ph.D. , of the Environmental Protection Agency , who was the lead author of the study . `` When people are on the threshold of having , a serious asthma attack , particles can push them over the edge . '' The Seattle Study correlated 13 months of asthma emergency room visits with daily levels of PM , , , . or particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 10 microns or less . These finer particles are considered hazardous because they are small enough penetrate into the lung . Cities are considered out of compliance with clean air laws if the 24-hour average concentration of PM10 exceeds 150 micrograms per cubic millimeter of air . In Seattle however , a link between fine particles and asthma was found at levels as low as 30 micrograms . The authors concluded that for every 30 microgram increase in the four-day average of PM10 , the odds of someone with asthma needing emergency treatment increased by 12 percent . The findings were published in the April American Review of Respiratory Disease , an official journal of the American Thoracic Society , the Lung Association 's medical section . The study is the latest in a series of recent reports to suggest that particulate matter is a greatly under appreciated health threat . A 1992 study by Dr. Schwartz and Douglas Dockery , Ph.D. , of Harvard found that particles may be causing roughly 60,000 premature deaths each year in the United States . Other studies have linked particulate matter to increased respiratory symptoms and bronchitis in children . `` Government officials and the media are still very focused on ozone , '' says Dr. Schwartz . `` But more and more research is showing that particles are bad actors as well . '' One problem in setting , standards for particulate air pollution is that PMIO is difficult to study . Unlike other regulated pollutants such as ozone and carbon monoxide , particulate matter is a complex and varying mixture of substances , including carbon , hydrocarbons , dust , and HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 29 Volume 6 , Number 10 April 20 , 1993 acid aerosols . `` Researchers ca n't Put people in exposure chambers to study the effects of particulate air pollution , '' says Dr. Schwartz . `` We have no way of duplicating the typical urban mix of particles. `` Consequently , most of what is known about particulates has been learned through population-based research like the Seattle study . Given that the EPA 's current priority is to review the ozone and sulfur dioxide standards , the agency is unlikely to reexamine the PM10 standard any time soon . Until changes are made , there appears to be little people with asthma can do to protect themselves from airborne particles . `` In some areas , you can get reports on air quality , but the reports only cover the pollutant that is closest to violating its standard , and that 's rarely particulate matter , '' says Dr. Schwartz . `` However , PM10 does n't have to be near its violation range to be unhealthy . '' HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 30 Volume 6 , Number 10 April 20 , 1993 NIH Consensus Development Conference on Melanoma The National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference on Diagnosis and Treatment of Early Melanoma brought together experts in dermatology , pathology , epidemiology , public education , surveillance techniques , and potential new technologies as well as other health care professionals and the public to address ( 1 ) the clinical and histological characteristics of early melanoma ; ( 2 ) the appropriate diagnosis , management , and followup of patients with early melanoma ; ( 3 ) the role of dysplastic nevi and their significance ; and ( 4 ) the role of education and screening in preventing melanoma morbidity and mortality . Following 2 days of presentations by experts and discussion by the audience , a consensus panel weighed the scientific evidence and prepared their consensus statement . Among their findings , the panel recommended that ( 1 ) melanoma in situ is a distinct entity effectively treated surgically with 0.5 centimeter margins ; ( 2 ) thin invasive melanoma , less than 1 millimeter thick , has the potential for long-term survival in more than 90 percent of patients after surgical excision with a 1 centimeter margin ; ( 3 ) elective lymph node dissections and extensive staging evaluations are not recommended in early melanoma ; ( 4 ) patients with early melanoma are at low risk for relapse but may be at high risk for development of subsequent melanomas and should be followed closely ; ( 5 ) some family members of patients with melanoma are at increased risk for melanoma and should be enrolled in surveillance programs ; and ( 6 ) education and screening programs have the potential to decrease morbidity and mortality from melanoma .

HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 31 Volume 6 , Number 10 April 20 , 1993 NCI-Designated Cancer Centers The Cancer Centers Program is comprised of 55 NCI-designated Cancer Centers actively engaged in multidisciplinary research efforts to reduce cancer incidence , morbidity , and mortality . Within the program , there are four types of cancer centers : basic science cancer centers ( 14 ) , which engage primarily in basic cancer research ; clinical cancer centers ( 12 ) , which focus on clinical research ; `` comprehensive '' cancer centers ( 28 ) , which emphasize a multidisciplinary approach to cancer research , patient care , and community outreach ; and consortium cancer centers ( 1 ) , which specialize in cancer prevention and control research . Although some cancer centers existed in the late 1960s and the 1970s , it was the National Cancer Act of 1971 that authorized the establishment of 15 new cancer centers , as well as continuing support for existing ones . The passage of the act also dramatically transformed the centers ' structure and broadened the scope of their mission to include all aspects of basic , clinical , and cancer control research . Over the next two decades , the centers ' program grew progressively . In 1990 , there were 19 comprehensive cancer centers in the nation . Today , there are 28 of these institutions , all of which meet specific NCI criteria for comprehensive status . To attain recognition from the NCI as a comprehensive cancer center , an institution must pass rigorous peer review . Under guidelines newly established in 1990 , the eight criteria for `` comprehensiveness '' include the requirement that a center have a strong core of basic laboratory research in several scientific fields , such as biology and molecular genetics , a strong program of clinical research , and an ability to transfer research findings into clinical practice . Moreover , five of the criteria for comprehensive status go significantly beyond that required for attaining a Cancer Center Support Grant ( also referred to as a P30 or core grant ) , the mechanism of choice for supporting the infrastructure of a cancer center 's operations . These criteria encompass strong participation in NCI-designated high-priority clinical trials , significant levels of cancer prevention and control research , and important outreach and educational activities -- all of which are funded by a variety of sources . The other types of cancer centers also have special characteristics and capabilities for organizing new programs of research that can exploit important new findings or address timely research questions . HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 32 Volume 6 , Number 10 April 20 , 1993 Of the 55 NCI-designated Cancer Centers , 14 are of the basic science type . These centers engage almost entirely in basic research , although some centers engage in collaborative research with outside clinical research investigators and in cooperative projects with industry to generate medical applications from new discoveries in the laboratory . Clinical cancer centers , in contrast , focus on both basic research and clinical research within the same institutional framework , and frequently incorporate nearby affiliated clinical research institutions into their overall research programs . There are 12 such centers today . Finally , consortium cancer centers , of which there is one , are uniquely structured and concentrate on clinical research and cancer prevention and control research . These centers interface with state and local public health departments for the purpose of achieving the transfer of effective prevention and control techniques from their research findings to those institutions responsible for implementing population-wide public health programs . Consortium centers also are heavily engaged in collaborations with institutions that conduct clinical trial research and coordinate community hospitals within a network of cooperating institutions in clinical trials . Together , the 55 NCI-Designated Cancer Centers continue to work toward creating new and innovative approaches to cancer research , and through interdisciplinary efforts , to effectively move this research from the laboratory into clinical trials and into clinical practice .

Copyright 1993 , Information , Inc. , Bethesda , MD ================================================================== April 12 , 1993 ================================================================== '' NIH Set to Test Multiple AIDS Vaccines '' Reuters ( 04/08/93 ) ( Frank , Jacqueline ) Washington -- The Clinton administration will permit the National Institutes of Health to test multiple AIDS vaccines instead of only allowing the Army to test a single vaccine , administration sources said Thursday . The decision ends the controversy between Army AIDS researchers who had hoped to test a vaccine made by MicroGeneSys Inc. and the National Institutes of Health , which contended that multiple vaccines should be tested . Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said a final announcement on the therapeutic vaccine trials was expected to be made last Friday . Companies including Genentech Inc. , Chiron Corp. , and Immuno AG have already told NIH that they are prepared to participate in the vaccine tests . The testing is intended to demonstrate whether AIDS vaccines are effective in thwarting the replication of HIV in patients already infected . Shalala refuted last week 's reports that the Clinton administration had decided the Army 's test of the MicroGeneSys VaxSyn should proceed without tests of others at the same time . `` The report was inaccurate , and I expect there to be some announcement in the next 24 hours about that particular AIDS research project , '' said Shalala . Administration sources subsequently confirmed that NIH director Dr. Bernadine Healy and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner David Kessler had convinced the White House that multiple vaccines should be tested simultaneously . But MicroGeneSys president Frank Volvovitz said a test of multiple vaccines could triple the cost of the trial and delay it by two years . ================================================================== HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 41 Volume 6 , Number 10 April 20 , 1993 '' The Limits of AZT 's Impact on HIV '' U.S. News & World Report ( 04/12/93 ) Vol . 114 , No . 14 , P. 18 AZT has become the most widely used drug to fight AIDS since it was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1987 . Burroughs Wellcome , the manufacturer of AZT , made $ 338 million last year alone from sales of the drug . However , a team of European researchers recently reported that although HIV-positive patients taking AZT demonstrated a slightly lower risk of developing AIDS within the first year of treatment , that benefit disappeared two years later . The Lancet published preliminary findings of the three-year study , which could give more reason for critics to argue the drug 's cost , side effects , and general efficacy . Even though U.S. researchers concede the study was more comprehensive than American trials , many argue the European researchers ' suggestion that HIV-positive patients experience little improvement in their illness before the development of AIDS symptoms .

( ! ) > Either some of you are a little paranoid ( no offence ... ) Mr. Parsli , I have to take exception at this . There are verifiable , previous *examples* of levels of U.S. governments abusing gun-control restrictions . I do n't think it is paranoid to worry that what has been abused in the recent past might be abused in thye future . After so many times of getting burned any sane person will stop putting his hand on the stove . > OR you should > get a new goverment . ( You do have elections ? ? ) I 'd love to . But as long as the politicians grab power to sell pork back to their constituents , there 's not a lot I can do . It 's silly to suggest that if there 's anything we ca n't trust the government to do , and therefore the government should be allowed to do it , then we should change governments . Down that road lies total government power . I 've never been a fan of totalitarianism . > Guns ' n Criminals : > MOST weapons used by criminals today are stolen . This is very likely . > Known criminals can NOT buy weapons , that 's one of the points of gun control . > And because gun control are strict in WHOLE scandinavia ( and most of europe ) , > we dont have any PROBLEM with smuggled guns . The North American Continent is not Europe , no matter how many people would like it to be . Drugs are very illegal and they're here . For years Canada has crowed about its gun control . If it is necessary to control guns over the whole continent , then Canada should have always had comparable rates to the U.S. , yet they still do n't . Unless you can tell me why the Canadian border is so much more magical than the Mexican border ( which is shorter and far more heavily patrolled ) then I really ca n't accept that argument . > Mixing weapons and things that can be use as one : > What I meant was that cars CAN kill , but they are not GUNS ! No , there are approximately 31,000 deaths due to guns in the U.S. , two-thirds of which are suicides . ( Unfortunately I do n't have suicide rates for Norway . ) However , this makes the per-gun death rate about half the per-car death rate . > The issue ( I hope.. ) : > I think we all agree that the criminals are the main problem . > Guns are not a problem , but the way they are used is ... . ( and what are they for ? ? ) > > I think this discusion is interesting when you think of ( ex ) Jugoslavia : > They should all have weapons , it 's their rigth to have them , and if they use them > to kill other ( Innocent ) people the problem is humans , not guns . The problem 's been humans since before we had stone axes . The fct of the matter is simply this : If nobody ever assaulted anybody , whether there is a weapon of any sort around would be totally irrelevent . Yet weapons are *built* . I 'd suggest , then , that the murderous impulse in humanity pre-dates weapons . Anyway , the Bosnians et al . have been making an excellent attempt to kill each other for half a thousand years . Taking away their guns , even if we could , would neither halt the killing nor reduce the brutality . > If 50 % of ALL murders was done with axes , would you impose some regulations on them > or just say that they are ment to be used at trees , and that the axe is not a problem , > it 's the 'axer ' ? ? > ( An example , do n't flame me just because not exactly 50 % are killed by guns ... ) In the U.S. , approximately 60 % of murders are commited with firearms . ( 50 % with handguns , 10 % with non-handguns . ) The reason I say that guns , per se , are not the problem , is that our non-gun rate exceeds most of Europe's countries *entire* violent crime rate . I do n't really think we 've got more knives or fists . In any case , I think examples of gun control *applied* to the U.S. have been abkect failures , just like drug prohibition and other forms of prohibition . Until you deal with *why* people are doing what they are doing , you wo n't solve your problem . And if the problem is violent crime , you should n't concentrate on the tools instead . The *vast* majority of guns is never , ever misused . ( On the order of 99.5 % over the entire lifetime of the gun ) . This says to me that you ca n't make the argument that the gun itself causes the misuse . > Think about the situation in Los Angeles where people are buying guns to protect > themselves . Is this a good situation ? ? The situation is not `` good '' in that people fear for their lives . But recall the scenes of the store-owners during the last riots , protecting their shops with guns . Would it have been better they , too , lost their livelihoods ? > Is it the rigth way to deal with the problem ? ? The problem of poverty and rage in Los Angeles , no it is n't . However , if that problem becomes a violent action , then yes , it can be appropriate . Whether or not some person has been hurt by their condition wo n't make me less dead if they burn down my house with me in it . You have to examine which problem you 're referring to . If you 're discussing someone violently assaulting you , then it is a perfectly legitimate response to make them stop . ( Hopefully simply letting them know you 're prepared to shoot them would be enough , as it was with the above-mentioned store-owners . ) > If everybody buys guns to protect themselves from criminals ( and their neighbor who have > guns ) what do you think will happen ? ? ( I mean if everybody had a gun in USA ) 45 % of Households have some form of firearm , usually a long gun . That accounts for a level of access for at least 100 million Americans . Firearm ownership is most likely among educated , well-off whites , the group *least* likely to be involved in violent crime .

That is your opinion and the opinion of the Israeli government . I agree peace guarantees would be better for all , but I am addressing the problem as it stands now . Hopefully a comprehensive peace settlement will be concluded soon , and will include security guarantees for both sides . My proposal was aimed at decreasing the casualties in the interim period . In my opinion , if Israel withdraws unilaterally it would still be better off than staying . The Israeli gov't obviously agrees with you and is not willing to do such a move . I hope to be be able to change your opinion and theirs , that 's why I post to tpm . | > If the Lebanese army was able to maintain the peace , then | > Israel would not have to be there . Until it is , Israel prefers that | > its soldiers die rather than its children . As I explained , I contend that if Israel does withdraw unilaterally I believe no attacks would ensue against northern Israel . I also explained why I believe that to be the case . My suggestion is aimed at reducing the level of tension and casualties on all sides . It is unfortunate that Israel does not agree with my opinion . | > | > > If Israel really wants to save some Israeli lives it would withdraw | > > unilaterally from the so-called `` Security Zone '' before the conclusion | > > of the peace talks .

It seems to me that the better bargaining position is while | > holding your neighbors land . Because Israel is not occupying the `` Security Zone '' free of charge . It is paying the price for that . Once Israel withdraws it may have lost a bargaining chip at the negociating table but it would save some soldiers ' lives , that is my contention . If Lebanon were willing to agree to | > those conditions , Israel would quite probably have left already . | > Unfortunately , it does n't seem that the Lebanese can disarm the | > Hizbolah , and maintain the peace . That is completely untrue . Hizbollah is now a minor force in Lebanese politics . The real heavy weights are Syria 's allies . The gov't is supported by Syria . The Lebanese Army is over 30,000 troops and unified like never before . Hizbollah can have no moral justification in attacking Israel proper , especially after Israeli withdrawal . That would draw the ire of the Lebanese the Syrian and the Israeli gov'ts . If Israel does withdraw and such an act ( Hizbolllah attacking Israel ) would be akin to political and moral suicide .

I can't remember trying to rebuild the desktop with it , however it did give me a strange problem . When I held down shift during startup to disable all extensions , nothing happened .

I checked the dipswitches and they are fine . Try disabling your extensions and tell me if it works . I am annoyed with Datadesk . I sent them the keyboard in the mail for inspection/repair/replacement .

So , if you reply to this , please send private email to the address esther @ demand.ed.ray.com -- I have set the Reply-To line to have that address but I do n't know if it will work . [ It depends upon the software , but generally I would n't expect reply-to to cause an email cc to be sent in addition to a posting . You 'll probably need to do something specific , which will vary depending upon your news software . -- clh ] At any rate , I need some support . ( Much thanks to Jayne K who is already supporting me with kind words and prayers ! ) I 've been working at this company for eight years in various engineering jobs . I 'm female . Yesterday I counted and realized that on seven different occasions I 've been sexually harrassed at this company . Seven times . Eight years . Yesterday was the most recent one ; someone left an X-rated photo of a nude woman in my desk drawer . I 'm really upset by this . I suppose it could have been worse -- it could have been a man having sex with a sheep or something . There was no note . I do not know if it was : - someone 's idea of an innocent joke , that went awry - someone 's sick idea of flirting - an act of emotional terrorism ( that worked ! ) I dreaded coming back to work today . What if my boss comes in to ask me some kind of question , I do n't know the answer so I take a military specification down off from my shelf to look up the answer , and out falls a picture of a man having sex with a sheep ? I generally have a Bible on my desk for occasional inspiration ; what if I open it up to Corinthians and find a picture a la the North American Man Boy Love Association ? I want to throw up just thinking about this stuff . I can lock up my desk , but I ca n't lock up every book I have in the office . I ca n't trust that someone wo n't shove something into my briefcase or my coat pocket when I 'm not looking so that I go home to find such a picture , or a threat , or a raunchy note about what someone wants to do to my body . To make it worse , the entire department went out to lunch yesterday to treat our marvelous secretary to lunch . The appointed hour for leaving was 11:30 . I was working in another building but wanted to go to the lunch . So I returned at 11:25 , only to find that ever single person had already left for lunch . They left at 11:15 or so . No one could be bothered to call me at the other building , even though my number was posted . So , I came back to a department that looked like a neutron bomb had gone off and I was the sole survivor . This , despite the fact that everyone knew how bad I felt about this naked woman being left in my desk drawer . I need some prayers -- - I ca n't stop crying . I am so deeply wounded that it 's ridiculous . I feel like I 'm some kind of sub-human piece of garbage for people to reduce me and my sisters to simply sex organs and the sex act . I feel like I 'm a sub-human piece of garbage that 's not worthy of a simple phone call saying `` We 're leaving for Mary 's lunch a little early so that Bob can get back for a big 1:00 meeting ... '' Please pray that my resentments will either go away , or be miraculously turned into something positive . Please pray that whoever is torturing me so will stop , and find some healing for him- or herself . Please pray for my being healed from this latest wound ( which falls on top of a whole slew of other wounds ... ) . Please pray that I can find a new job in a place where the corporate culture does its best to prevent such harrassment from happening in the first place , and swiftly acts appropriately when something occurs despite its best precautions . ( This company , in my opinion , has pretty words about how sexual harrassment is n't tolerated but when you get right down to it , how is it that one female engineer can be touched inappropriately , left obsene or threatening notes , left obscene pictures , spoken to lewdly , etc , seven times in eight years in the same place ? Pretty words from the company do me no good when I 'm terrified or healing from the latest assault . ) And please pray that I do n't turn into an automaton because of this . That 's my bad habit : `` ignore it and it will go away '' , `` you 're not worth anyone 's time so do n't go talking to anyone about this '' , `` you 're right , you are a sub-human piece of garbage and deserve to be treated this way '' , `` you are just an object '' , `` you prostitute your mind to this company so why ca n't others expect you to prostitute your body there as well ? `` , `` what makes you think women are n't just possessions , and nothing more than sex organs and their ability to perform the sex act ? '' This is the kind of thinking that can catapault one into a major depressive episode ; please pray that these thoughts do n't come into my head and stay there , triggering depression . Please pray that this latest trauma does n't come between me and God . In a way , a wound like this is an invitation to a deeper connection to God , and it 's also a possible trigger for a spiritual crisis that can separate one mentally from God . ( I know God does n't drop me from his loving hand , but it 's awfully easy for me to walk to the edge of the hand , look down , think I 'm falling and forget that God 's still holding on to me . ) Although this probably is n't entirely appropriate for this newsgroup , I really can use the kind of loving support you all provide . For this reason I hope good Mr. Moderator allows me this latest indulgence . After all , he 's allowed me the thermometer note , and a few other off-the-wall topics .

Windows will use a swap file larger than the recommended size . Last summer I went to a Microsoft Windows 3.1 Technical Workshop and they distributed A LOT of information that the general public might not be aware of . Anyway in the main book they handed out they have a section on `` Creating larger than recommended swapfile '' . I 'll quote the information If you create a permanent swapfile larger than the recommended size , you will receive a message telling you that Windows will not use anything larger than the recommended size . THIS ERROR MESSAGE IS INCORRECT , we will allow the use of the larger swapfile , up to four times the amount of RAM on your machine . So as you see , Microsoft does know that the information is incorrect . You probably just ran into some doofball who was new on the job and was only telling you what little he knew . Be that what it may , I would really suggest to everyone to take the opportunity to go to these Technical Workshops . They are n't actually incredibly in-depth , but you do get a lot of material about bugs and optimization straight from those in the know . Besides that they offer you HUGE discounts on software . If I remember correctly , you could pick up Word 2.0 , Excel 4.0 , or whatever their presentation program is for $ 130 . That is the full blown version , not an upgrade or educational version . You could also pick up Microsoft Office for $ 500 or something like that . Myself I sprang for Word . Well , hope that was helpful to someone . And besides that I hope someone will go to a workshop and save a little money . And if anyone at Microsoft is reading this -- I really love your products . I need a job once I graduate also , can we work something out ? ; - ) Thanks , Brent Casavant bcasavan @ mailhost.ecn.uoknor.edu

From : bear @ kestrel.fsl.noaa.gov ( Bear Giles ) Subject : How do they know what keys to ask for ? ( Re : Clipper ) Organization : Forecast Systems Labs , NOAA , Boulder , CO USA Lines : 24 This may be a stupid question , but how does the government know which keys to ask for ? Will owners be required to REGISTER their phones , faxes , modems , etc. , and inform the government when they are moved to a different phone number ? Will there be penalities if the public does not do this ? Will identification ( the National Health Care ID , perhaps ) be required when purchasing a Clipper-equipted phone ? Or will each chip transmit identifying information at the start of a conversation ? Identification which could be used to automatically log who calls whom ? ( The _phone_ company keeps records , but this information would be accessable by a well-placed van near a microwave relay station ) . This raises the question of how the two phones agree on a communications encryption key . Will it be something that is derived from information exchanged at the start of the conversation -- and hence derivable by an eavesdropper ? -- Bear Giles bear @ fsl.noaa.gov

It 's amazing how everyone automatically blames one side or the other . One thing for sure : Koresh will have no chance to defend himself against the statements ( lacking in fact or COurt sponsored verification ) made by agents who participated in the situation that killed him . I do n't know they murdered him ; I also do n't know that the Branch Davidians set a fire and suicidede .

If anyone thinks blaming Koresh -- or the BATF helps this any at all , is sick . and wrong . The reason you can tell that the BATF may not be entirely straight on this is that the leaders at press conferences havew made ANY comments about even the POSSIBILITY that Koresh or his followers caused this .

I do hate liars or the six letter variety of same . The official side has its advocates already ; lets balance the equation and asj a few questions on the other side , for the sake of an old saw the BATF abd FBI seem to want to bypass : innocent until proven guilty . not innocent until presumed guilty . 1 ) Where are the video tapes from the tanks ? ALL of them . Do n't tell me they do not exist . They are standard equipment . 2 ) So you think Koresh fired the place , because of the explosion ? a ) Tear gas comes with an aerosol to spread it . This aerosol is DELIBERATELY made to be as non-flammable as possible . It is as non-flammable as possible . ... . gotcha ! ... when in isolation from other substances . WHy was a pipe deliveryu system used rather than remote launchers ? WHy did the FBI not announce `` this window , blown in plus tear gas , five minutes ; then the wall come down '' , and maintain a left to right sequence ? b ) Most aerosols also have a secondary compound , that when mixed in , becomes a VERY flammable ( and difficult to trace ) suspension , with a VERY special property : exposure to brief eruptions of high heat ( muzzle blasts ) or long exposure to low heat ( matches , a stove ) will NOT tend to ignite . What other chemicals come up in the forensics ? Who else will be allowed to test the site ? c ) After a few minutes to hours ( ifdesired , the combnation rate can be controlled as desired ) , the mixture can be made to become veryignitable onb exposure to a temperature above a certain point ( a tracer round ) for a certain heat quantity ( a small explosive charge ) or for a length of time ( start a wall fire and wait ) . Check your military records ; look at the tapes . Why were tanks ( large capacity delivey systems ) , tear gas ( why not somnorifics ? ) , and now ( why the hurry . was there still a comm channel open to the outside ? ) . Do you see any trace of fire coming BACK to the compound in the videos ? ALL the videos ? Which ones are missing ? Do I sound paranoid ? Maybe . Am I ? Probably not . You trust the FBI and BATF to render judgement ? IN advance of a Court ? God help us . ( For we are surely not helping ourselves ) . You trut the Federal Gevernment to give us a clean slate ? You are 4.3 trillion ( admitted ! ) down and counting . Look again . Did it happen that way ? I do not know . I was not there . AND IT SHOULD WAIT FOR A COURT TO DECIDE .

Yes , absolutely , though I 'd make the observation in a more general sense of all observations are made by human beings and therefore made with various biases . But here your message leaves talk of hypothesis and gets back , once again , to equating the business of science with the end result , the gizmo produced . > Science works very well at developing theories > within paradigms , but is very poor at dealing with paradigm shifts .

Indeed we now > recognize an important psychological component to healing . Perhaps you 'd admit that this is an oversimplification on your part ( the topic of the philosophy of science is made for them , I 'm making them too ) but I think that it also summarizes popular misconceptions of science and the business of doing science . Biomedical research does n't make any basic assumptions that are n't the same as any other discipline of scientific research . That is , that you make empirical observations , form an hypothesis and test it . Modern medicine has much more to do with biochemistry than '' the old Newtonian model of the world '' . And I doubt that many psychologists would appreciate being put outside this empirical `` world view '' . Psychology also has more to do with biochemistry than spoon bending . > It is also important to distinguish reason from science . Science may be > reasonable , but so are many non-scientific methodologies . Aristotle reasoned > that frogs came from mud by observing one hop out of a puddle . Oversimplified , of course , but a good example . This is an empirical observa- tion . It was then tested , though perhaps not by Aristotle , and eventually found wanting . In the meantime , some folk will have continued to believe in the spontaneous generation of animal life . There 's nothing at all surprising about this , it 's the way the gathering of knowledge works . There are probably more than a few things in my own discipline of molecular biology that will be found to be totally off-base , even idiotic , to someone in the future . These future people wo n't have come to these relevations because they had suddenly gone all Zen-like and had a vision in an LSD trip . Someone will have thought of something new and tested it . This is the bit that people who seem to relish misrepresenting science and research ca n't seem to wrap their minds around . Science is a creative process . What I think of as factual and good research can be totally turned on its head tommorrow by new results and theories . Again , I think it gets down to defining what you mean by `` science '' . I often do n't recognize what it is that I do , and am involved in , in the way science is portrayed by popular media or writings of people in the humanities . They portray science as a collection of immutable facts , pronouncements of TRUTH in big gold letters . That 's silly . Its as though we just go into the lab , turn over a stone , and come up with a mechanism for transcriptional regula- tion . Its much more interesting than that . It really is a very human process .

Here are the details of the car : 1958 Hardtop -- Exterior condition : Rocker panels rusted out at weld points , no rust at typical spots like door hinge mounting points , back battery box , etc . Missing front bumper , front pan dented up , one weld popped in front . This is for the most part a solid , restorable automobile . Interior Condition : Missing original steering wheel , has one of the smaller aftermarket wheels , seats need reupholstered , general fair condition . Mechanical Condition : Had been running , but now does not want to start ... needs new rings ( which I have ) also have extra parts such as complete long block , extra steering shaft , etc . For a car that has not been touched since 1958 , it is in solid shape . It will obviously need some work , but will make a good project . PRICE : Well , this is a tough one , I would like to get around 800.00 , but will consider any serious offers by individuals willing to come and get it . If you have things to trade such as tools , toys , cameras , comics , cards , etc. , anything easily movable to Florida , I may consider that as well .

From : by028 @ cleveland.freenet.edu ( Gary V. Cavano ) Subject : Pantheism & Environmentalism Organization : Case Western Reserve University , Cleveland , Ohio ( USA ) Lines : 21 Hi ... I 'm new to this group , and maybe this has been covered already , but does anybody out there see the current emphasis on the environment being turned ( unintentionally , of course ) into pantheism ? I 've debated this quite a bit , and while I think a legitimate concern for the planet is a great thing , I can easily see it being perverted into something dangerous . As evidence , may I quote THE WALL STREET JOURNAL ( of all things ! ) , April 2 ( Editorial page ) : '' We suspect that 's because one party to the ( environmental ) dispute thinks the Earth is sanctified . It 's clear that much of the environmentalist energy is derived from what has been called the Religious Left , a SECULAR , or even PAGAN fanaticism that now WORSHIPS such GODS as nature and gender with a reverence formerly accorded real religions .

From : rats @ cbnewsc.cb.att.com ( Morris the Cat ) Subject : Re : WI and IL firearms law Questions Organization : AT & T Distribution : usa Lines : 56 |Question # 2 |As I understand it , in Evanston , IL , they have a ordinance banning handguns . |Is there any way to get around this provision ? Why do n't you call the City and ask ? Oak Park also has an illegal handgun ban as well , but does allow those with a `` collectors FFL '' to possess ( `` collectible ? '' ) handguns . |What would the penalty if you were found out be ? Probably a fine in practical terms . |What if you used said handgun in a defensive shooting in your apartment |there ? How would the city law apply to your impending |trial for the shooting ? It would n't impede your defense at all . There was an actual incident in Oak Park where a gas station owner engaged in a shootout with a handgun ; the grand jury decided not to presecute . On the other hand , a black man used an illegally owned handgun in Oak Park to defend himself , and the Village tried to make an example out of him . An NRA Director who lived there made a stink about this , and it was decided not to charge the guy . Of course , pissing off anti-gun police thugs has it 's own drawbacks , like when the Oak Park Police Chief came to his house , and told him : `` this is stepping over the line ; this could get dangerous for you . '' Whereupon the few black Oak Park police officers watched over his house to ensure that the white anti-gun police chief and his anti-gun cronies would n't f*ck with him , his home or family . |Also , what is IL state law concerning short barreled weapons ? Short barreled |shotgun is what I would be interested in if a handgun were not available , |either that or a shortened 9mm carbine ( ie Colt , Marlin ) . L.V . Cipriani states that the `` Any other weapon '' category is allowed , but the exact relationship between an Ithaca Auto-burgular , which I believe is in the `` Any other weapon '' category and a chopped barrel H & K HK-94 ( Class 3 for sure ) is not clear to me ... |One more thing , what is the chance of getting a CCW permit in IL without being |rich or famous or related to the mayor ? In your dreams , buddy . As long as Democrats reign in Chicago , Illinois residents will always be disarmed and helpless in the streets . Politicians get around this by provisions in the law that allow them to carry concealed weapons . Voters in Chicago are too stupid to vote these a**holes out of office ; because the Dems are always in power , the Illinois Supreme Court is always tilted to the Democratic Party 's views on guns . [ All candidates supported by political consultant David Axelrod are anti-gun , which explains anti-RKBA Crook County States Attorney Jack ( ass ) O'Malley being a so-called `` Republican . '' ] Get rid of the Chicago Democrats , get rid of their members on the IL Judiciary , and you got a fighting chance of a preemption law and a CCW law ...

Although both of the papers ( Turk and Witkin & Kass ) were very well organized and extremely helpful , I guess what I need is a more basic description of the technique , especially wrt the control mechanisms .

I just got through listening to the 10 o'clock news on Channel 4 here in Dallas . They trotted out a list of justifications produced by the ATF after '' months of investigation '' for their raid . I could n't believe the junk on this list ! For example , the BDs were accused of stockpiling a bunch of `` 9mm and .223 ammunition that can be used in M15 and M16 assault rifles '' . Imagine that -- they had ammunition ! They also had aluminum dust ! ( Yeah , it 's a component of thermite , but so far I haven't heard that it 's illegal to take a grinder to the aluminum lawn furniture ... ) The only thing on the list that could conceivably have been illegal was an M-79 grenade launcher .

From : JBUDDENBERG @ vax.cns.muskingum.edu ( Jimmy Buddenberg ) Subject : Revelations - BABYLON ? Organization : Muskingum College Lines : 34 Hello all . We are doing a bible study ( at my college ) on Revelations . We have been doing pretty good as far as getting some sort of reasonable interpretation . We are now on chapters 17 and 18 which talk about the woman on the beast and the fall of Babylon . I believe the beast is the Antichrist ( some may differ but it seems obvious ) and the woman represents Babylon which stands for Rome or the Roman Catholic Church . What are some views on this interpretation ? Is the falling Babylon in chapter 18 the same Babylon in as in chapter 17 ? The Catholic church ? Hate to step on toes . thanks -- -- -- -- Jimmy Buddenberg INTERNET : jbuddenberg @ vax.cns.muskingum.edu Muskingum College [ Reading this imagery as the Roman Catholic Church was certainly common in earlier Protestant writers . A lot of us find that frankly embarassing now , though some of our readers will certainly advocate such a position . The problem is that the description makes it look a lot like a political entity . It 's associated with kings , controls world commerce , is seated on seven mountains ( 17:9 -- recall that Rome is traditionally regarded as built on seven hills ) . If it 's a church , then it 's not the current Roman Catholic church , but a church that has been taken over by the anti-Christ and merged with the state , turning into something rather different than it is now . Presumably in such a scenario the true Catholics are among those who are persecuted . Given the overall impression that Satan is pretending to be an angel of light , and the true church is a persecuted remnant , I think the most consistent playing out of the image would be that the anti-Christ would be presiding over a church that claims to be the heir of both the Protestant and Catholic traditions , but that the true spiritual descendants of both Peter and the Reformers are equally being persecuted . -- clh ]

And why are we in Somalia ? When right across the Gulf of Aden are some of the wealthiest Arab nations on the planet ? Why does the US always become the point man for this stuff ? I do n't mind us helping out ; but what invariably happens is that everybody expects us to do most of the work and take most of the risks , even when these events are occuring in other people 's back yards , and they have the resources to deal with them quite well , thank you . I mean , it 's not like either Serbia , or Somalia represent some overwhelming military force that their neighbors ca n't handle . Nor are the logistics a big deal -- it 's a lot bigger logistical challenge to get troops and supplies from New York to Somalia , than from Saudi Arabia ; harder to go from Texas to Serbia , than Turkey or Austria to Serbia . -- -peter

It would if malpractice and `` defensive medicine '' were the main factors in explaining spiralling US health care costs , but they are n't . Although Gary is correct in noting that malpractice-related problems are greater in the US than Canada , they by no means account for the overall difference in health care costs . ( They do account for a somewhat larger portion of the difference in physicians ' gross income in the two countries . ) Some facts . Malpractice insurance and awards account for less than 1 % of total health care costs in the US . In 1991 , according to a survey of physicians conducted by a national medical journal physicians averaged paying 3.7 % of their practice receipts in malpractice insurance . Malpractice insurance premiums and malpractice awards peaked in 1985 ; they 've declined significantly since then . At the same time , health care costs have increased more than any period in history . As far as `` defensive medicine '' is concerned , the AMA estimates that its total impact is about $ 7 billion per year . That 's about 8 % of the total current INCREASE in health care costs -- and the estimate is from a group that could be expected to overestimate the impacts of defensive medicine on health care . As small a problem as this is in the overall scheme of things , however , Clinton has been on record for a long time favoring an indemnification of MD 's against malpractice suits if they follow procedures set by their specialties . This would eliminate most , if not all frivolous suits while retaining the ability to sue for true malpractice . jsh -- Steve Hendricks | DOMAIN : steveh @ thor.ISC-BR.COM '' One thing about data , it sure does cut| UUCP : ... ! uunet ! isc-br ! thor ! steveh the bulls**t.

The machine also uses a Super IDE I/O Card ( model PT-604 ) . ( of course niether the motherboard or the I/O card booklet clearly state who the manufacurers are ) I 'm also using a Trident 8900C SVGA card . Anyway , that 's all of the pertinent info I can think of . My problem is that the computer often freezes or displays `` Parity Error -- System Halted '' messages depending on whether I set the Memory Parity Error Checking to `` disabled '' or `` enabled '' in the setup of the bios ( makes sense ) . Its AMI bios ( so it must be an AMI board ? ) . I just took it back to the dealer and they replaced all of the SIMMS but I keep getting the same error ( more frequently now ) . It all worked at the dealer and did n't start screwing up 'till I got home ( figures ) . I 've tried to take out all of the SIMMS and even re-inserted them in reverse order , making sure that the connections were solid . My suspicion jumps to this damn all in one HD controller/serial/ parallel/game-port I/O card , or to the motherboard ( God forbid ) . CAN ANYONE HELP ?

Evidence given for her prostitute status , besides the admittedly questionable claim of the man on trial included : 1 . Prior employment in a number of massage parlors , with women who claimed that she worked as a prostitute ; 2 . Walking around a truck stop at 4:00 AM wearing a lace miniskirt , a halter top , and no underwear of any sort ; 3 . Not having a purse or other I.D . with her .

From : kilroy @ gboro.rowan.edu ( Dr Nancy 's Sweetie ) Subject : Re : Food For Thought On Tyre Summary : Another Inerrantist rewrites the Bible . Keywords : Scripture , implication , prophesy , ` Woof ! ' Organization : Rowan College of New Jersey Disclaimer : Brandy the WonderDog hopes his doghouse will be rebuilt . Lines : 93 There has been a lot of discussion about Tyre . In sum , Ezekiel prophesied that the place would be mashed and never rebuilt ; as there are a lot of people living there , it would appear that Ezekiel was not literally correct . This does n't bother me at all , because I understand the language Ezekiel used differently than do so-called Biblical literalists . For example , it sometimes happens that someone says `` My grandson is the cutest baby ! '' and then turns around and sees the granddaughter and says `` Oh ! Is n't she the cutest thing ! ? '' This person is not literally claiming to have lined up all the babies in the world according to cuteness and discovered his own grandchildren tied for first . Rather , he is trying to express his emotions using words that are very object-oriented . Because this example is one that is common to many people , nobody misunderstands the intent of the statements ; the Bible , however , is often at the mercy of people who assume that everything within must be exactly literally true . For those people , the existence of Tyre is a problem ; for me , it is not . Turning to the latest person trying to defend Ezekiel , we read this from John E King : > The prophesy clearly implies that people would still be living in the > area [ . ] No , it implies nothing of the kind . If you had nothing but the prophecy from Ezekiel , and you were told you interpret it literally , you would never say '' Oh , he means that there will be houses and businesses and plants and stuff like that . '' You would read `` I will make you a bare rock '' and `` You will never be rebuilt '' , and you 'd conclude that Tyre would be a bare rock . The only way to get from ` fishing nets ' to ` houses and buildings and a medium-large population ' is if you KNOW that all that latter stuff is there . In other words , your answer means that Ezekiel misled everybody who read the prophecy at the time it was written . There is no way that , given a literal reading , they could read this passage and conclude `` medium-size city '' . You seem to feel that `` Never be rebuilt '' means `` be rebuilt '' -- maybe so , but it is hardly a ` clear implication ' . Mr King also writes : > So far I 've seen stated figurers ranging from 15,000 to 22,000 . > Let 's assume the latter one is correct . By modern standards > we are talking about a one-horse town . Well , no . That 's only a bit less than the population of Annapolis , where I'm from . You know , the Naval Acadamy , the state capital , George Washington resigned his commission in the statehouse ? Annapolis may not be New York , but it 's at least a two-horse town . But supposing 22,000 people is a `` small town '' -- it 's still 22,000 people MORE than Ezekiel predicted . And you 've said nothing about the other problem . In chapter 26 , Ezekiel predicts that Nebuchadnezzar will will destroy Tyre and loot all their valuables . However , Nebuchadnezzar did NOT destroy Tyre , and in chapter 29 Ezekiel even quotes God as saying `` he and his army got no reward from the campaign he led against Tyre . '' Let 's ignore Alexander for a moment , and just pay attention to chapter 26 . Ezekiel says N. would destroy Tyre , and N. did NOT destroy Tyre . Ezekiel says that N. would plunder their valuables , but N. did NOT plunder their valuables . Regardless of what you think about Tyre _now_ , the fact is that N. died before the place was destroyed . Ezekiel said N. was going to do it , and N. did not . * This post is , of course , pointless . Inerrantists have an amazing ability to rewrite the Bible as needed to fit whatever they want it to say . For example , I expect Mr King to respond to the comments about Ezekiel 26 by pulling some `` clear implications '' out of hat . When Ezekiel said that N. would `` demolish your towers '' , that clearly implied that the walls would still be standing so people would know where the towers used to be . And when Ezekiel said that N. would `` demolish your fine houses and throw your stones , timber and rubble into the sea '' , that clearly implied that N. would never set foot on the island . And when Ezekiel wrote that N. would `` build a ramp up to your walls '' , that clearly implies that N. would spend 13 years stomping around on the mainland and never get close to the walls . See ? A few `` clear implications '' that are totally contrary to the text , and you can reconcile anything you want . Darren F Provine / kilroy @ gboro.rowan.edu '' [ Do ] You know why I 'm the enabler ?

They are n't designed , they evolved . And , much as it discomforts us , in humans a trouble-free birth process was sacrificed to increased brain and cranial size . Wild animals have a much easier time with birth than humans do . Domestic horses and cows typically have a worse time . To give you an idea : my family tree is complicated because a few of my pioneer great-great- grandfathers had several wives , and we never could figure out which wife had each child . One might ask why this happened . My great-great- grandfathers were , by the time they reached their forties , quite prosperous farmers . Nonetheless , they lost several wives each to the rigors of childbirth ; the graveyards in Spencer , Indiana , and Boswell , North Dakota , contain quite a few gravestones like `` Ida , wf . of Jacob Liptrap , and baby , May 6 , 1853 . '' > You wanted > to section all women carrying breech in case one in a hundred or a > thousand breech babies get hung up in second stage , More like one in ten . And the consequences can be devastating ; I have direct experience of more than a dozen victims of a fouled-up breech birth . > and now you want > all babies born in hospital based on a guess of how likely maternal > hemorrhage is and a false belief that it is fatal . It is n't always fatal . But it is often fatal , when it happens out of reach of adequate help . More often , it permanently damages one 's health . Clearly women 's bodies _evolved_ to give birth ( I am no believer in divine design ) ; however , evolution did not favor trouble-free births for humans . > You have your kids where you want . You encourage your wife to > get six inch holes cut through her stomach muscles , expose herself > to anesthesia and infection , and whatever other `` just in case '' measures > you think are necessary . My , are n't we wroth ! I have n't read a more outrageous straw man attack in months ! I can practically see your mouth foam . We 're statistically sophisticated enough to balance the risks . Although I ca n't produce exact statistics 5 years after the last time we looked them up , rest assured that we balanced C-section risks against other risks . I would n't encourage my wife to have a Caesarean unless it was clearly indicated ; on the other hand , I am opposed ( on obvious grounds ) to waiting until an emergency to give in . And bear this in mind : my wife took the lead in all of these decisions . We talked things over , and I did a lot of the leg work , but the main decisions were really hers . > But I for one am bothered by your continued > suggestions , especially to the misc.kidders pregnant for the first > time , that birth is dangerous , even fatal , and that all these > unpleasant things are far better than the risks you run just doing > it naturally .

My wife was unwilling to take any significant risks in order to have nice surroundings . In view of the intensity of the birth experience , I doubt surroundings have much importance anyway . Somehow the values you 're advocating seem all lopsided to me : taking risks , even if fairly small , of serious permanent harm in order to preserve something that is , after all , an esthetic consideration . -- Mark A.

Waldron . It will be held at 7:30 p.m. at the Rockwell Science Center in Thousand Oaks , CA . Dr. Waldron is currently a Technical Specialist in Space Materials Processing with the Space Systems Division of Rockwell International in Downey , California . He is a recognized world authority on lunar materials refinement . He has written or coauthored more than 15 articles or reports on nonterrestrial materials processing or utilization . Along with Dr. David Criswell , Waldron invented the lunar/solar power system concept . Momentum is building for a coalition of entrepreneurs , legal experts , and Soviet and U.S. scientists and engineers to build the Lunar Power System , a pollution-free , energy source with a potential to power the globe . For the past three years members of the coalition , nearly half from California , have rejuvenated the commercial and scientific concept of a solar power system based on the Moon . The LPS concept entails collecting solar energy on the lunar surface and beaming the power to Earth as microwaves transmitted through orbiting antennae . A mature LPS offers an enormous source of clean , sustainable power to meet the Earth 's ever increasing demand using proven , basic technology .

There are other animals on this planet with advanced mental facilities which have not developed `` religion '' as a satisfactory explaination for the unexplained . Why is this so ? Further , it appears that only humans have a `` need '' to explain the unexplained . Why is this so ? The other animals on this planet , including those with advanced mental facilities , seem perfectly content in their ignorance . I 'd like to point out that your presuppositions scream out at me from your unsupported statement . They are : 1 ) humans are animal *only* ; 2 ) religion exists as a crutch so that the unexplained need not be researched ; 3 ) religion was `` made up '' by humans to address a perceived need ; 4 ) the biological aspect of humans is deified ( that is , all aspects of human life can be categorized in a hierarchical structure with biology at the apex ) . Needless to say , I disagree with your strong opinion # 1 and the underlying presuppositions . > Christianity is an infectious cult . The reasons it flourishes are > because 1 ) it gives people without hope or driven purpose in life > a safety blanked to hide behind . `` Oh wow..all i have to do is > follow this christian moral standard and I get eternal happiness . '' > For all of you `` found jeezus '' , how many of you were `` on the brink ? '' I disagree that Christianity is `` an infectious cult '' . It has certainly shown itself to be persistent as a belief system , in spite of various persecutions throughout the past two millenia . That it continues to persevere does not demonstrate that it is '' infectious '' in a derrogatory sense ; it may be that it provides a workable system for its adherents ( and I would argue that this is the case ) . I disagree that Christianity is `` a safety blanket '' which supplants hope and purpose . Rather , it points an individual to the one Source of hope and purpose . There is nothing hidden about a Christian 's source for hope and purpose . Of what usefulness to you is the distinction between internally motivated hope and purpose and externally given hope and purpose ? Is the ( apparent ) loss of control over one 's own life the problem or is it something else ? Finally , one does not appropriate `` eternal happiness '' by following Christian moral standards . Indeed , the sole reason for the existance of Christianity is *because* standards are inadequate to save people from their imperfections . Moral standards are merely guides to the Christian ; the real power to moral living is given to the Christian in the Person of God 's Spirit . Heaven is one of two final states that Christian doctrine postulates . However , Christians are generally not motivated to live according to Christian moral standards by this promised future reward ; rather , they are motivated by the perceived benefits to them in the here-and-now . > but i digress ... The other reason christianity flourishes is its > infectious nature . A best friend of mine breifly entered a christian > group and within months , they set ministry guidelines for him which > basicaly said this -- > Priority # 1 Spread the Word . Many Christian organizations are concerned with evangelism as a priority , and rightly so ( for it was Jesus Himself who gave this as a priority for His followers ) . However , it is not the penultimate priority as evangelism is normally understood ( i.e . preach the word , convert at nearly any cost , repeat with new convert ad infinitum ) . Rather , such evangelism is generally best done through respecting the opinions of others while *demonstrating* the very real benefits of a Christian lifestyle . This demonstration should be so powerful that it compels the non-Christian to seek out the Christian to ask '' Why ? '' Needless to say , such a demonstration is not easily accom- plished ( it takes a radical committment to the person of Jesus ) , it does not happen quickly ( so perseverance on the part of the Christian is required ) , and it can not occur where no personal bonds of friendship exist ( it is ineffective with strangers who can not evaluate the demonstration over time , and it is easy to alienate or harm others if the sole purpose of being a `` friend '' is to gain a conversion ) . As a long-time Christian ( nearly 20 years ) , I view with some skep- ticism *all* evangelism programs which incorporate a `` hurry-up '' attitude . Pressured conversions may ultimately be worse than no conversion at all ( because the pressured convert realizes s/he was coerced and disavows Christianity when they would have been open to it in the future had they not been taken advantage of now ) . The Bible states that it is the very Spirit of God which brings conviction of wrong-doing to people . I am content to do my part ( witness ) and let the Spirit do the rest . > We are _just_ animals . We need sleep , food , and we reproduce . And we > die . We are far more than animals . We sleep , eat , reproduce , and die just as other animals do - true .

( please , if i am mistinterpreting , correct me . ) however , i have witnessed marriages where two people were very much in love but recognized that they were destroying themselves and each other by staying in a marriage , and that the problems were due to personal childhood issues that had never been resolved . i ask you , is divorce justified in such a case ? they knew who they were , what they were doing , they were deeply in love , but in the end , it did not work out . i must admit that i do n't see jesus forcing them to live together , or even condemning that they go and seek happiness with someone else later on . opinions ? vera ******************************************************************************* I am your CLOCK ! | I bind unto myself today | Vera Noyes I am your religion ! | the strong name of the | noye @ midway.uchicago.edu I own you ! | Trinity ... . | no disclaimer -- what - Lard | - St. Patrick 's Breastplate | is there to disclaim ? ******************************************************************************* [ This is a commonly discussed question , though it 's been long enough that I 'll allow it to be asked . As you might expect , there is a range of answers . Catholics and some others will say that divorce is never justified . ( By the way , in situations where someone is being abused , or for other serious cause , separation is allowed by all traditions that I know . No one should be forced to stay in a situation where they are in danger . ) Others see it as a last resort in situations that have fallen apart badly enough that the best we can hope for is to choose the lesser of evils . In some sense the difficult legal question turns out not to be divorce , but remarriage . That 's because of Jesus ' statement in Mark 10:11-12 and par . As with so many other things , this turns on your approach to the Bible . Conservative Protestants tend to see statements like this as having no exceptions . More liberal ones are willing to make allowances for situations where a literal interpretation would lead to painful results . ( It is noted that at the time it was possible for a man to divorce his wife almost on a whim . Thus a common explanation in the more liberal approach is that Jesus was trying to protect people from this sort of thing , not to establish an absolute rule to which there could never be exceptions . ) Catholics , as is typical with Catholic ethics , take a theoretical hard line , but allow for exceptions in practice through the process of anullment . In the last discussion most of our non-Catholic readers seemed to accept with some reluctance that in some cases there might be no good alternative , but there was a feeling that the church should often be doing a better job of helping people prepare for marriage and deal with problems that come up during it , and that in a properly run church , divorce should not be necessary . -- clh ]

While I do n't mean to damn Henrik 's attempt to be helpful here , he 's using a common misconception that should be corrected . Mach banding will occur for any image . It is not the color quantization you see when you do n't have enough bits . It is the human eye 's response to transitions or edges between intensities .

The military surplus stuff I've driven -- `` Jeep Classic '' ( Willys/Kaiser/AMC , pre-independent suspension ) and Power Wagons ( Slant 6 in a crew-cab pickup ) were n't exactly congenial at highway speeds , and I wouldn't swear any of them would do 80 except as a bedload on a semi . You just got ta love the standard military tire , too , or at least the one they used to use . Designed circa WW II as a compromise between traction in icky sticky goo and longevity on sharp rocks and so forth , it 's quite ill-adapted to high speeds on civilian roadways . For those who ca n't remember what they look like , imagine a mountain-bike tire with a road rib in the middle , scaled up to car size . Oh , yeah , and narrow too . One of the standard mods for civilizing a surplus Jeep was to install tires and wheels that reflected some of the advancements made in ride and handling since D-Day . But the point made by Wharfie and others still stands : if you 're going to do 80 in a mil-spec '58 Power Wagon ( or a Jeep or a tank transporter or other unwieldy rubber-tired vehicle ) anywhere , I 'd suggest the American interstate . Your safe speed there tends to be limited more by your car and skills , road maintenance , and the swarms of fools around you ; the roads were designed for going like the devil .

From : daa7365 @ tamuts.tamu.edu ( Diego A. Aranda ) Subject : Windows Shareware Monthly ( INFORMATION ) Article-I.D . : tamsun.1ps35rINNfpd Organization : Texas A & M University , College Station Lines : 100 NNTP-Posting-Host : tamuts.tamu.edu Windows Shareware Monthly ( WSM ) is an on-line forum for information about the newest and best Windows 3.x and NT shareware/freeware software . WSM is a compilation of submissions from shareware/freeware authors in a single Windows .HLP ( Help System ) file . All types of software may be submitted for entry in WSM - utilities , applications , games , programming tools , etc . WSM benefits Windows shareware/freeware authors by allowing them to publicize their software releases , inform users of updated versions , and to increase their installed base of users . Those searching for specific Windows software will benefit by having a complete list of available software available at their fingertips - complete with feature lists , current prices , and any other relevant information . Windows software authors may submit entries to Windows Shareware Monthly in the following manner : 1 . Compose a short summary of the function of the software . Include all special features which are unique to your product and which set it apart from other programs in the genre . Be sure to include specific details such as : the current release version , where the software is available , how much the registration fee costs , how much disk space is required , any special requirements ( e.g . sound card , or VBRUN200.DLL , etc . ) , how the author may be contacted , etc . Because text is highly compressible , the summary may be as long as is necessary , however , it is best to keep it short . A good guideline is a single screenful of 12-point text at 640x480 resolution . Order forms and other such addendum may be included if desired . All submissions whould be in plain text ( ASCII ) format . Formatting will be exactly as it is submitted - I will simply cut and paste text files into a Help Authoring system . If you require special formatting conventions - such as boldface text or italics , or a larger font size , indicate so CLEARLY within the text file . For best results , use Windows NotePad to create the .TXT file . 2 . Include up to 100k of Windows-format .BMP ( bitmap ) screen-shots which display the workings or special features of each program . Special cases ( rendering applications for example ) which require 256-color bitmaps may submit up to 250k of .BMP files - all other should observe the 100k limit and use 16-color format . For maximum compatiblity with the software which will be used to create the WSM .HLP file ( Stefan Olson 's Help Writer's Assistant for Windows ) , please save the bitmaps with Windows Paintbrush or WinGIF . 3 . Include a 16-color .BMP of the program 's icon ( .ICO file ) . Many programs are available to convert .ICO to .BMP format , or Windows Paintbrush may be used . The .BMP will be embedded in the summary text . 4 . Double-check for spelling errors , formatting corrections , etc . 5 . Compress the .TXT file , the .BMP of the program icon , and any additional .BMPs into a single file using PKZIP ( any version ) . 6 . Submit the entry by UUENCODING the .ZIPfile , and e-mailing it to : DAA7365 @ TAMUTS.TAMU.EDU if submitting via the Internet or Compuserve . If submitting via America Online , send a brief message indicating submission , and append the .ZIP file , then e-mail to : DiegoAA 7 . If any changes are required , or a new version is released , complete the above procedures again . Send all submissions to the @ TAMUTS address , and any comments , suggestions , criticisms , to DAA7365 @ RIGEL.TAMU.EDU . All entries received before the deadline will be included in the subsequent edition of WSM . The editor will not be held responsible for any errors , and we reserve the right to make changes to the entries . WSM is not limited to shareware/freeware software . A special area will be devoted to commercially available Windows 3.x and NT software . Commercial software authors should follow the same steps above , with the exception of the limitations on size - the .TXT file and .BMPs may be as large as required ( and as large as is practical for transmission over phone lines ) . There is no charge for the publishing of either shareware/freeware or commercial product entries . Advertisements for computer hardware , software , bulletin boards , etc . may be submitted as well . Again , the same procedures apply , with the exception of the size limitations . There is no charge for advertising space . The first ten advertisements submitted each month will be included ; subsequent submissions will not be included due to size constraints . WSM is currently looking for persons willing to devote the time to author columns within WSM . A C/C++ programing section , a Visual Basic section , and two Windows-specific opinion/advice columns are envisioned . All work will be on a voluntary basis . If you wish to aid WSM and author a monthly column on one of the above topics , please send us mail at DAA7365 @ TAMUTS.TAMU.EDU or DiegoAA on America Online . The first edition of WSM will be distributed May 1st via America Online , Compuserve , and the Internet . The deadline for submissions is April 28th . The first edition filename will be WSM-1.ZIP , with each subsequent monthly release continuing in the series naming convention ( WSM-2.ZIP , etc. ) . Each edition will be released on the first of each month , and the deadline for submission will be at least three days before release .

While I think it is unrealistic to suppose that the federal agencies will fail to promptly comply with a court order , there is still a good point here . Local law enforcement will be unable to perform a wiretap without bringing in federal agencies . Based on the ( possibly incomplete ) understanding of the system quoted from D. Denning , only the FBI will be able to decrypt the system key encryption layer , which seems to be needed even to identify what escrowed keys to request . This moves a great deal of law enforcement power to the federal level . The reason I like this point is that it may sway or even persuade people who do n't generally line up with the civil liberties crowd . A national police force is opposed by people from a broad range of political viewpoints . olson @ umbc.edu

Once more around the racetrack . See the original statement that it is nonsense to believe that you can not legislate morality . I simply stated that they can pass all the laws they want but not a single one of them will make you or I more moral people . They may make us act in a moral manner , but our actions are only a reflection of the unwillingness to risk punishment . They say nothing about whether we have become more moral or not .

Yes , it was specifically the *ability* or understanding of the technique which was absent .

The specific recommandation cited in the Hurt study was that a formal '' street strategy '' , like SIPDE for example , was the most important component of any rider education curriculum . The specific skills of emergency braking , cornering and swerving must be taught and practiced as well , but more significant was that 35 % of rider did NOTHING confronted with a potential accident , and another third collided or fell over as a result of rider error .

On of the attributes of being sacred in this case is that they should not be spoken of in a `` common manner '' or `` trampled under feet '' such as the Lords name is today . The ceremonies are performed in the temple because the temple has been set aside as being as sacred/holy/uncommon place . We believe that the ceremonies can only be interpreted correctly when they are viewed with the right spirit- which in this case is in the temple . So from our point of view , when they are brought out into the public , they are being trampled under feet , because of misinterpretations and mocking , and it is therefore offensive to us .

My understandingis that former officer Cranston approached a teenager who was being questioned by another officer . Officer Cranston struck Teenager A in the head with a heavy police flashlight , causing a significant , though not life-threatening . THere is no evidence that Teenager A was doing anything threatening at the time . Teenager A was released on bail/recognizance and filed a formal complaint against Officer Cranston . The Police Chief suspended Cranston pending an investigation into the use of excessive force . The above is pretty clear ... but what seems to have happened is this . The Chief requested Cranston 's gun , but Cranston refused to turn it over until the Chief went the Cranston 's home to get it . Sources said Cranston had always wanted to be a cop and was very afraid of loosing his job because of the complaint against him . A few days afterward , Cranston allegedly walked into Wilson 's Garage , where Teenager A and friends were known to hang out and work on cars as a hobby . Cranston fatally shot Teenager A as well as TEenagers B and C. Teenager D was shot once in the shoulder/chest . Teenager E was working under the car and was not noticed by Officer Cranston . Teenager D went to a home and summoned police , who went to Wilson 's Garage and found the 3 corpses and one unscathed survivor .

Let 's assume a brute-force engine like that hypothesized for DES : 1 microsecond per trial , 1 million chips . That's 10^12 trials per second , or about 38,000 years for 2^80 trials .

I do n't doubt that this will be the attitude of many corporate leaders . It 's understandable -- most corporate execs do n't know much about cryptology , and it 's easy to get taken in by someone peddling snake oil . And , the proposed scheme *is* a major improvement in telephone security to what exists now . The problem is that , with any security scheme of this kind , you have to concern yourself with the weakest link in the chain . I suspect that NSA has put a fairly strong encryption algorithm in this wiretap chip of theirs , probably at least as strong as ( say ) DES in OFB-mode . Unfortunately , the existence of the key-registry system seems to make possible all kinds of possible attacks at a small fraction of the expense of trying to build ( say ) a DES keysearch machine . As originally described , it sounded like any police / court combination could acquire the key for a given chip . I hope that 's not the case , since it would imply a glaring hole . ( How much does it cost to find *one* crooked jodge and *one* crooked cop ? Especially for a foreign intelligence agency or organized crime boss ? ) However , even if more intelligent schemes are used to allow access to the unencrypted phone conversations , there will be weak- nesses . They may be very expensive , and very difficult . But who would trust his/her confidential information to an encryption scheme that , for ( say ) $ 100,000 could by cracked one time in a hundred ? ( DES , for all the complaints about a 56-bit key , would probably cost several million dollars to build a keysearch machine for . ) How many million dollars would the confidential phone messages of the GM headquarters be worth to Nissan , Chrysler , or Audi ? How about home phones of major execs and important engineers and designers ? `` Gee , Mr Jones , I understand you 've had some financial problems lately . Maybe I can help ... '' > > I 'd trust something from the NSA long before I 'd trust something from some > > Swiss or anybody Japanese . Indeed , if NSA really designed the algorithm to be secure , it 's very likely as secure as IDEA or 2-key DES . However , the system as a whole is n't resistant to `` practical cryptanalysis . '' In _The Puzzle Palace_ , Bamford describes how several NSA employees were turned by foreign ( presumably KGB ) agents , despite security measures that I doubt any Big 8 accounting firm could match . And NSA confidential data was *not* subject to being requested by thousands of police organizations and courts across the land . -- John Kelsey , c445585 @ mizzou1.missouri.edu

Interesting . Where there is no divine imperative of course we must establish rules of operation . But we can not be as creative with what God has explicitly spoken on .

Then we got on the Sumgait bus bound for Baku for my first cousin 's birthday , my father , my mother , and I .

When we were entering town , near the 12-story high-rises , our bus was stopped by a very large crowd . The crowd demanded that the Armenians get off the bus . The driver says that there are no Armenians on board ; then everyone on the bus begins to shout that there are no Armenians on board . The group comes up to the doors of the bus and has people get out one by one , not checking passports , just going by the way people look . We get off the bus , but are not taken for Armenians . We set out in the direction of home . At first we were going to go into an old building where we knew there 'd be a place to hide , but the whole road was packed with groups of people , all the way from Block 41 to the 8th Microdistrict . These groups were emptying people 's pockets and checking passports . People who did n't have passports with them were beaten as well . Then we decided to go home instead . Near the 12-story high-rises I saw burning cars and a great many people standing around the driveways , yelling . `` Death to the Armenians '' was written on the cars . When we came into the courtyard -- we live in an L-shaped building -- it was still quiet . We went on upstairs , but did n't turn on any lights . We tried to call Baku to warn our relatives , who were due to arrive on Wednesday , not to come . Then there was a knock at the door . It was our neighbors , who advised us to come down to stay at their place . We went down to their place , and they led us to the basement . They live on the first floor and have a basement which you enter across the balcony . We sat in the basement while an Armenian woman was beaten -- she ran away naked . Our neighbors ' daughter said that that 's right , that 's what the Armenians deserve , because in Stepanakert , allegedly , people were being killed , 11 girls from Agdam had been raped . We did n't stay very long in the basement . We tried to support one another as best we could , looking out the small window with the iron grating . Papa watched and said things now and then . He said that there was a fire near Building 5 , probably a car on fire . Then one of the groups approached our driveway and demanded that they be shown the apartments where Armenians lived . The neighbors said that there were n't any Armenians here , and the group set out for the other wing of the building . They appeared from the 5/2 side of the building , where , I later found out , a woman had been murdered . The woman who ran away naked died . Yuri Avakian was killed , too . When the crowd left , the neighbors said that it was all over and we could go home . We went back up to our place and again did n't turn on the light . We started to gather up our things in order to leave Sumgait for a while . We tried to call a relative who lived in Sumgait , but there was no answer . We decided she had already left . We sat at home . The phone rang , and the caller asked to speak with my father . I called him to the phone . It was Jeykhun Mamedov , from my father's work brigade . He said he was disgusted by what was happening in our town . He asked for our address and promised to get a car and help us get out of the city . To be quite honest , Papa did n't want to give him our address , but my mother got on the phone and told him . Some 15 minutes after the call a crowd ran into our entryway . Bursting into the building , they broke down the door and came into the apartment . . . They came straight to our apartment , they knew exactly where the Armenians were . They came into our place . We tried to resist , but there was nothing we could do . One of them took my parents ' passports and began to read them . He read the surname `` Danielian , '' turned the page , read `` Armenian , '' and that alone was enough to doom us . He said that we should be moved quickly out into the courtyard , where they would have done with us . Another , standing next to him , pushed some of the keys on the piano and said `` your death has tolled . '' They had knives and steel truncheons . I had a knife in my hand . Unfortunately , I did n't use it . I just knew that if I did n't give up the knife things would be much worse . They struck my parents and said that I should put the knife on the piano . Then , one of them commanded that we be taken outside . One person was giving orders . When we were taken outdoors I went in the middle , and my mother was behind me . Someone started to push her so she 'd walk faster ; I let her go ahead of me , and fell in behind her . When he tried to push me , I hit him , and at that moment they began beating my parents ; I realized that resistance was completely useless . We are taken out into the courtyard , and the neighbors are standing on their balconies to see what will happen next . The crowd surrounds us . At first they strike me , and I 'm knocked out ; when I come to , they beat me again . . . I lose consciousness often . . . I do n't see or hear my parents , since I was the first one hit and was out cold . When I come to I try to pick them up ; they are lying next to me . The crowd is gone , the only people around are watching from their balconies . That 's it . I try to pick them up , but ca n't . My left arm is broken . I start toward the drive , wanting to tell the neighbors to call an ambulance . The bodies of my parents are still warm . We were attacked at around 9 o'clock . I regain consciousness at about 11 and try to make it up the stairs home . . . When I knock at the neighbors ' door , they push me back and tell me to go away . I go up to the third floor , our neighbor puts a damp cloth on my head and says she will call an ambulance ; she sends her son off for one and takes me to our apartment . I often look out the window to see if the ambulance has arrived , but I ca n't see very far as a result of the blows , and it seems that my parents have already been taken away . Then I calm down and try to convince myself that they have been taken away , and everything will be OK . But they were still there . Later , at 8 in the morning as I found out , the ambulance picked them up , but they were already dead . If they received attention on time , it is possible they would still be alive . Later , around 12 o'clock on the 29th , policemen in civilian clothing come to our house with some `` assistants . '' They call an ambulance , and 20 minutes later it arrives , and I am taken to the Sumgait Emergency Hospital . There they stitch the wounds on my head and rebind my arm . At 3 o'clock I and the other Armenians who are in the hospital are sent by ambulance to Baku . In my ward at the Sumgait Hospital there were five people , all of them Armenians . The hospital was nearly overflowing with Armenians . The only Azerbaijanis there were those whose car had flipped over before the events , before the 27th . Then I was in the Semashko Hospital in Baku . I was there 38 days . When I was released , on the 40th day , I found out that my parents were dead . At first they told me that they were in Moscow being treated , but later I found out that they were dead . My father 's older brother told me . My father 's name was Nikolai Artemovich Danielian . He was born in 1938 . My mother , born in 1937 , was Seda Osipovna Danielian . Papa worked at PMK-20 , the leader of the roofing brigade ; mamma was a compressor operator . They were also beaten on the head . The coroner 's report stated that their heads were smashed open and bled profusely . At the confrontation I met Jeykhun Mamedov , who had called . As it turned out later , he had been the one who tipped the crowd off . He had called specifically to find out if we were at home and to find out the exact address and dispatch the group . He knew the phone number , but did n't know the address . Before the events I had never seen him , but had often spoken with him on the phone , when he would ask to speak with my father . I knew him by name . He denies that I was the one who answered the phone , saying that my father answered it . He denies that he called from a public phone , saying that he called from home , which also is n't true . I heard noise and the sounds of automobiles . As I later found out , earlier he had been convicted , but had never served any time -- he had received a suspended sentence . He was about 20 years old . I do n't know if he has since confessed or not . I am sure that he was the one who tipped the crowd off . One-hundred percent sure . My parents were from Karabagh . Father was from the village of Badar , and was two years old when his family moved to Baku , where his elder brothers were to go to school . He was a student at the Naval School , but never graduated . He went off to work on the virgin lands [ one of the gigantic agricultural projects instituted under Khrushchev . ] When he returned he lived in Baku , and later moved to Sumgait , helping with the town 's construction . Mamma was from the village of Dagdagan , also from Karabagh . She worked in Sumgait , first in a bookstore , and later , on a construction site . My sister is older than I . She lives with her husband here in Karabagh . I always loved my parents . That was why I went on to 9th grade , because it was their dream that I would continue my studies . I finished 8th grade and wanted to enter the Baku Nautical School , and after that , the Military School . But later I changed my mind , or rather , my parents got me to recon- sider , saying that it would be better to finish the 10th grade and then join the Naval School . I was planning to be in the Navy almost my whole life long -- since childhood I had dreamed of being a sailor . My father wanted it more than anything . He always recollected his youth , telling of the School , and he always said that he had made a big mistake in leaving it . Now I live in Karabagh and never plan to leave here . I will stay at the home of my grandfather , of my ancestors , till the end of my days . While in the hospital in Baku I learned the fates of many others who had suffered as well , like Ishkhan [ Trdatov ] . He managed to hold them off [ at their residence in Microdistrict 3 , Building 6/2 , Apartment 6 . ] for a long time , lost his father [ Gabriel ] , and by some miracle managed to survive . I also learned of Uncle Sasha , from Building 5/2 , whose daughter was raped . . . Besides them , Valery -- I forgot his last name -- was in the hospital too , about a year younger than I , he went to School No . 14 . He was riding with his parents in the car . People were throwing rocks at them , he was hit , and his parents brought him to the hospital , and he was in our ward . We even came to be friends . Before that we had just seen each other around town . But in the hospital we got to know one another better . I learned of the fates of others , those who had died , or who were befallen by misfortune . . . Today Suren Harutunian , the First Secretary of the Communist party of Armenia , was shown on television . To be honest I am glad that Armenia agreed to recognize Nagorno Karabagh as part of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic . I was repelled , no , revolted , to hear the Baku announcer who read the decision of the Azerbaijani Supreme Soviet Presidium against Karabagh becoming part of Armenia . After the events in Sumgait and those in Baku , the best solution is to give Karabagh to Armenia , return it to Armenia , since the people want to live peacefully with the Azerbaijanis , but everything has to be right before they can do that . I arrived in Karabagh on April 11 . I felt very bad . I had constant headaches . After a while my strength returned . My older sister , Suzanna , took me in . I think that justice should prevail ; the people are demanding their due . You ca n't take away what is their due . My parents and I often spoke of Nagorno Karabagh , often visited here -- spent almost all of my vacations here . We had even decided that if Karabagh would be made part of Armenia , we would move here for sure . We always said that the Armenian people had suffered much , and that what had been done in 1921 -- removing Nagorno Karabagh from Armenia -- was wrong . Sooner or later , mistakes should be corrected . And in order to correct a mistake , it must not be repeated ; and the fate of all Nagorno Karabagh lies in the hands of our government .

I can only plead the exigency of the current dynamics in the space biz . This column is put together at lunch hour and after the house quiets down at night , so data can quickly build up if there 's a lot of other stuff going on .

As published in `` US Industrial Outlook 1993 '' ( which was released in January ) , revenues from the 1993 US space business are currently projected to be about $ 4,890 M. In contrast to previous years when US commercial space sales had shown double digits growth rates , this year 's projected results are driven by the US satellite manufacturing industry , where sales are projected to drop from 12 satellites worth $ 1,300 M in 1992 to 7 satellites worth $ 670 M in 1993 . The US Industrial Outlook also projects U.S. commercial launchers faces flat demand in coming year , and while predicting that 1993 revenues will increase 10 percent to $ 450 M , future sales will be `` adversely affected by the downward revision in Department of Defense launch plans . '' Offsetting flat launch revenues and satellite deliveries , revenues for fixed and mobile satellite services are projected to increase to $ 1,900 M , primarily driven by increased revenues from broadcast and cable TV networks . Similarly , remote sensing products and sales are projected to increase to $ 250 M in 1993 ( up 15 % ) .

In general , not a bad report -- with most of the bad news concentrated in the satellite manufacturing area . There , changes of only a few satellites worth $ 100 M or so apiece can substantially influence the annual projection . If we look forward over several years , this market sector should retain strong sales as US firms have been very successful in regaining international market share in the satellite business . Furthermore , sales of satellite ground equipment should go up in the next revision of this data , expected to be released about mid- year . Data on mobile satellite ground equipment sales ( including such items as GPS receivers and portable satellite terminals ) appears to be missing from the January data set . DoC usually publishes a listing of `` Space Business Indicators '' in mid-year , and the next revision of commercial space revenues should be released then . I expect the revised revenues should easily top $ 5,000 M , if the mobile satellite ground equipment are added back into the numbers , and the year should show about a 10 % overall market growth . Looking beyond this year 's data , future markets look quite promising . The DoC projects satellite service revenues could top $ 3,000 M by 1995 if new mobile satellite services and direct broadcasting are implemented as planned , and that mobile satellite station sales are expected to continue to growth at 15-20 % per year through the mid 1990 's . My numbers are somewhat more pessimistic for near-term market growth , but I agree the trend should be for substantial growth in US commercial space sales over at least the next 5-10 years . ( My pessimism is due to more conservative assumptions on market capture and growth in LEO communications and satellite direct broadcasting services . I do n't believe all of the current players in the yet-to-be-born LEO communications satellite market and in the yet-to-be-proven direct broadcasting market will be financial successes , nor that sales growth will be as explosive as currently projected . ) It should also be noted this year 's DoC data is the first release to show revenues from privately funded microgravity research facilities . The $ 60 M shown in the Janurary data is primarily for the Spacehab module , planned for launch in April on the Space Shuttle , but also hidden in these numbers are the projected first sales from the COMET orbital launch and recovery experiment module . ] 2- DELTA WINS TWO KEY LAUNCH CONTRACTS McDonnell Douglas Corporation , which builds and markets the Delta launch vehicle has won two important launch contracts . Motorola Inc. announced in mid February that it had selected the Delta to launch most of the satellites in the 66-satellite Iridium LEO communications constellation , and in mid April , McDonnell Douglas was awarded the USAF Medium Launch Vehicle III contract . The launch services contract with Motorola for the Iridium constellation launch is for at launch of least 45 Iridium satellites . Another 21 satellites have been contracted to be launched by Khrunichev Enterprise in Russian on 3 Proton vehicle launches . These 45 satellites planned for the Delta will be launched 5 at a time , providing for at least 9 launches . Additional satellites in the Iridium constellation , such as a planned on-orbit spares , may also be launched on Delta . Although details of the launch services contract were reported to be negotiation , and not yet final . The USAF MLV contract also went to MDC , bidding a variant of their Delta II launcher . This contract is only initially worth $ 7.5 million , but establishes a set of launch options for up to 36 launches , encompassing launches from 1996 through 2002 . These launches will deploy the next generation of the USAF 's Global Positioning System Block IIR navigation satellites , plus other programs . First option for to meet the USAF launch options is expected to be exercised this year , after which the USAF is expected to request launches of up to 6 Deltas per year for at least 6 years . Under this contract the USAF can also request `` launch on demand '' services from MDC for the 1996-2002 time period , with a launch to occur within 40 days of the request . [ Commentary : If these two contracts are fulfilled , they should provide an excellent business base for MDC 's Delta launch program through the turn of the century . Combined , these two contracts have a potential for about 45 launches , worth about $ 2,200 M to MDC , and sustaining a core business base of $ 300-400 M/year . Other contracts for international and commercial payloads , as well as for NASA Medium ELV-class payloads , will add to this business base -- keeping MDC as a viable commerical launch company . However , it should be noted there are risk elements in these contracts . Motorola 's Iridium LEO communications constellation has not yet received a US Federal Communications Commission license for operation in the U.S. , nor has Motorola lined up all the financing and financial partners for the Iridium venture . Without these approvals or financial backing there will be no Iridium launches . But , hopefully , these uncertainties will be settled this year . Similarly , the USAF MLV III program has been the target of several Congressional actions which have slowed the production of the GPS Block IIR satellites and deleted the funding for the MLV III program in favor of the USAF NLS/ '' Spacelifter '' program . At this time , while it appears the MLV III contract will be executed , future funding for the MLV III and other USAF commercial launch contracts is being reconsidered as part of national space launch strategy reviews . Some opinions expressed from within the Administration and Congress propose cancellation of all `` ELV upgrade '' programs ( including the MLV programs ) in favor of the proposed `` Spacelifter '' program . Such opinions may have some weight in this year 's budget deliberations , particularly as DoD funds will be more difficult to find in the shrinking US Defense budget . ] 3- COMMERCIAL REMOTE SENSING VENTURE GETS DOC `` GO-AHEAD '' The first commercial license to operate a remote sensing satellite was approved in early February by the US Department of Commerce 's Office of Space Commerce . A license was granted to WorldView Imaging Corporation of Oakland , California to build and operate a pair of LEO imaging satellites to provide multi-spectral images of the Earth . [ Commentary : There has been little data released on this venture by WorldView and the DoC , other than the announcement of the operating and construction license . This was reported to be at the request of WorldView . Most industry speculation identifies this new venture as a `` Star Wars '' spinoff , using SDI-type technology to provide digital Earth sensing data , and heavily integrated into digital GIS databases for remote sensing/GIS users . Most probable customers for this service include exploration geologists , agricultural planners , and urban planners . It is noteworthy this is the first commercial venture under the 1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act . The Act , as passed last November , provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote sensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices . Prior to this act , remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to all users at the same prices , and private remote sensing ventures would have had to sell at the government-set Landsat data prices . There are rumors of several other potential commercial remote sensing ventures working their way through the system at different stages of development . I think the large Landsat and SPOT satellite systems will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing data market for the next decade or so . In contrast to these large , government-sponsored remote sensing systems , smaller market ventures such as WorldView and others can exploit market niches and use innovative technology , and I believe , can find profitability on the margin . I predict there may be some very interesting ventures appearing in the next year or so . ] 4- INVESTMENT FIRM CALLS GD 'S SPACE BIZ `` STILL A GOOD INVESTMENT '' Wall Street investment house Morgan Stanley thinks General Dynamic 's Space Systems Division could still be a moneymaker , despite having failed in the last 3 Atlas launches . In a recent analyst 's report Morgan Stanley said `` We are more than ever convinced that if the company can return the Atlas to its historical 95 % -plus success rate , this will become a highly profitable , cash- generating unit . '' Based upon discussions with GD 's corporate management , Morgan Stanley projects that if the Atlas problems are cleared up the unit could see $ 70 M in earnings per year by 1995 and $ 100 M per year by 2000 . This is based upon GD 's projection of capturing about 10 Atlas launches per year on the world market . [ Commentary : Three failures in a row of their launch system has hurt General Dynamic 's Space Systems Division . Since GD has restructured to only keep a very few profitable core businesses , many market pundits have been speculating GD 's space business might be next to be sold . The Morgan Stanley report indicates GD 's Space Systems Division has some potential as a moneymaker , despite current problems -- if they can get their act together . Sales are projected to be about $ 560 M in 1993 , which will probably generate a loss of about $ 25 M. If GD can capture their projected share of the space launch market , and if they have managed to clean up the reliability of their Atlas launchers , then they could generate healthy profits from those sales . But until they demonstrate the Atlas Centaur program is back on track , this division will continue to show substantial losses . In response to the sell-off rumors , in my opinion , this operation is not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability . To do such a takeover , the current set corporate and divisional management would be replaced with another set from outside the firm . In GD SSD 's case , to get the division back on track , the management team will have to concentrate hard on the technical problems with the Atlas Centaur , as well as in selling Atlas services . This would indicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch operations could find such talent in-house , and be able to convince customers to buy their launch services . Optimally , the firm would have substantial liquid rocket experience , and experience in marketing space technology internationally as well . Candidates for this might be TRW , Rockwell , Lockheed , and Martin , and possibly McDonnell Douglas and Boeing . But most of those firms have cash flow problems ( MDC ) , have had a substantial business contraction ( Boeing and MDC ) , are involved with other launch firms ( Lockheed ) , or have taken on substantial debt ( Martin ) . And coming up with the $ 700-1500 M purchase price for the division is a big chunk of change for any company . ] 5 - ARIANE PREDICTS DIP IN LAUNCH DEMAND Arianespace , the operator of the Ariane launch system , is projecting a dip in launch demand in the late 1990 's . In early February , Arianespace released their annual market survey , which detailed their projection of the space transportation market for the next decade . Over short run , Arianespace expects to retain their dominant position and sustain a majority share of the launch market . Of 54 international and commercial launches planned through 1995 , Ariane holds contracts for 31 , General Dynamics ' Atlas vehicle holds 14 contracts , McDonnell Douglas ' Delta holds 7 , and Great Wall 's Long March vehicle holds 2 launch contracts . Three-quarters of future launch contracts for which Ariane can compete are projected to come from communications satellites with the remaining 25 % split between weather , Earth observation , and scientific satellites . Most of the future telecommunications demand growth is predicted to come from the Asia/Pacific region . Arianespace expects the current market consolidation of individual satellite operators into regional or national groups will continue , with these groups investing in heavier satellites with larger communications payloads carrying more transponders . Arianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunications satellites should increase by 20 % over today 's average level , to about 3000 kg in GEO . Demand for commercial launch services is expected to remain strong over the next three years , but in the second half of the decade , Arianespace predicts demand will decrease . Arianespace bases this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder demand and supply , particularly as new data compression techniques appear to could double or triple transponder capacity using existing or near-term transponders . One of the significant possible changes in the market was identified as the arrival of new launch vehicles , including Russian launch systems . But Arianespace predicts that in the long term , investors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade off between launch service quality and price , and that Russian and other new launch services will have to prove out their capabilities and service quality , and their market penetration will be minimal . [ Commentary : Ariane releases their market surveys annually , and I reported on their prior market survey in a past issue of CSN/STI . Comparing the two surveys , there are n't outstanding differences in the numbers . The most notable change is the consideration of new data compression techniques , reducing the demand for new physical transponders on orbit . I note that in contrast to some predictions , demand for space- based communications transponders appears to be remain strong . While fiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the established point-to-point telecommunications markets , growing demand for telecommunications services world wide and for point-to- multipoint broadcast services have prevented a decrease in space transponder demand . Fiberoptic cables provide a higher capability service , but only from established point A to established point B . To establish a fiberoptic link it is necessary to install cable between the points , and while there are improved network solutions , installing a large network of distributed fiberoptic links can cost millions or billions of dollars . For broadcast services where there is not an existing ground network structure , satellites still offer the most cost effective solution . And if new services are required into a new region , it is cheaper to install a small satellite link costing only a few tens of thousands of dollars and tie into the existing global satellite network . This allows rapid growth of new satellite services , and has kept demand high . The replacement market for fiberoptics is growing as well , since as demand grows between the points serviced , it becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to handle the increase in traffic . Since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still growing rapidly , satellite market projections remain rosy . But satellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes . Current generation satellites are now getting guarantees of at 15 years of on-orbit service or more , in contrast to 10 years of service from last generation 's satellites . This has cut back some of the launch demand , as satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite launches over longer intervals . And as last note ; Arianespace did n't flag it this year , but it looks like the space transportation market will be rather over- supplied by existing launch systems in the near term . The annual commercial launch demand is for about 15-20 medium sized satellites per year . From the supply side , Ariane is capable of launching up to about a dozen medium sized satellites a year , Delta is capable of about 9-12 per year , Atlas is capable of 6-12 , Long March 4-8 , Japan 's H-Vehicle 2-4 , Russia 's Proton capable of 8 , and other systems such as Zenit and Soyuz another 10-20 medium launches per year . That 's a lot of capability for a small market . We can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial launches . ] 6- NTSB INVESTIGATES PEGASUS LAUNCH OVER ABORTED ABORT The 9 Feb Pegasus launch by Orbital Sciences Corporation has spawned an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety rules . A valid abort order from a NASA range safety officer to halt the mission was overridden and the Pegasus was launched in violation of range safety rules . In the last few minutes of the Pegasus launch countdown , one of two abort command receivers aboard the Pegasus failed . Such a failure typically scrubs a launch , and a NASA range safety officer at Wallops Island , VA issued a mission abort order about a minute before the scheduled Pegasus launch . Somehow this command was overridden by the OSC launch team or the message was lost in the communications channels , and the Pegasus was launched despite the valid abort call . Fortunately , the Pegasus functioned as expected , and the abort command receiver was not needed . But this incident did spark an investigation since a valid abort order was given under agreed-to launch constraint rules , and was not obeyed . Leading the investigation is the National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ) with support from NASA , OSC , and the Air Force . This investigation marks the first time NTSB has taken the lead on an incident involving a space launch . According to the NTSB , their investigation will take about 6 months , and is primarily looking at lines of authority , communications links and safety procedures used in the launch . [ Commentary : This is the first time that the NTSB has led an investigation into a space launch . Their leadership was requested by the Department of Commerce 's Office of Commercial Space Transportation , who had licensed the commercial launch . At the time of writing this column , some of the initial investigations have been concluded , and some of the results are starting to leak out into the trade press . Apparently , 3 or four different communications channels were in use during the test . After the abort destruct receiver stopped responding , the NASA test director and range controller in the Mission Control room at Wallops Island gave abort orders about a minute before the launch . According to the mission rules , this should have stopped the launch . Somehow , the OSC test conductor ordered the abort reversed , and the NASA communicator on the net relayed that order to the B-52 carrying the Pegasus at about 22 seconds before launch . Differing explainations of exactly how this happened are proposed -- with the best set being that clear lines of communications and clear definition of the responsibilities of the mission control team , and understanding of the mission rules were not established before the launch . As we see more and more commercial launches , more of these procedural issues are going to crop up and will have to be resolved . This case is interesting because it is the first time the NTSB has been called in to investigate a commercial launch problem ( as they do with commercial aircraft problems ) . I think this problem will turn out to be primarily problems with procedures and communications , and will be cleared up with issuance of guidelines on how launch communications should be set up and how specific lines of authority should be delineated . ] 7- ANOTHER PEGASUS COMPETITOR IS ANNOUNCED Tsniimach Enterprise in Russia announced it is marketing a new small space launch system , based upon converted ICBM components . Two versions of the launcher are being marketed : the `` Aerokosmos '' winged vehicle launched like the OSC Pegasus , and the `` Severkosmos '' , launched from a mobile ground transporter . The Aerokosmos is projected to deliver 900 kg to a 200 km circular orbit or 580 kg to an 800 km circular orbit , and the Severkosmos to be capable of 430 kg to 200 km orbits and 225 kg to 800 km . Also proposed to be used with these launch systems is a LEO data relay system called 'Sineva ' . Tsniimach Enterprise is described as a ex-military establishment , focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection of spacecraft and which has participated in the development of the Buran shuttle system , They are located near the NPO Energia facility in Kaliningrad , outside of Moscow . [ Commentary : There 's very little released information on this new venture . My suspicion is it is another Russian enterprise looking for hard currency and trying to capitalize upon their in-house knowledge of ex-Soviet launch systems . It adds to the list of numerous commercial space startups announced from the ex-Soviet Union . This one 's a little different in that they are offering variants of ex-Soviet ICBMs , but I ca n't identify any key customers being targeted or substantial financial backing . ] 8- GEORGIA LAUNCH SITE DROPPED FROM PLANNING In late January , Georgia Tech Research Institute released the results of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial rocket launching site in Camden County , Georgia at the old Kingsland Missile Test Launching Site on the Atlantic coast . The preliminary study recommended the site not be pursued as a commercial launch site , stating reopening the site was not feasible due to projected low investment returns , plus environmental and other geographic considerations . However , the report did say the site might be ideal for other aerospace uses , and recommended other potential uses . [ Commentary : This should put the nails in the coffin of the Kingsland Commercial Launch Site . While other sites are still proceeding with commercial launch site development plans , Kingsland found without a key customer to act as anchor tenant , and if substantial infrastructure had to be put in , then the expected returns were too low to justify the cost of development . This might point out some key discriminators in judging the feasibility of a commercial launch site . These include : - Is there an identified key customer to provide core usage sufficient to recover setup costs ? - Is there a market advantage of using the site ? - Can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site ? - Can financing be found at low enough cost to support the investment ? Other commercial launch site ventures -- including those at Woomera , Poker Flat , Cape York , White Sands , Alabama Off-Shore Platform , Hawaii , and Vandenberg have to also be judged against these criteria . In my opinion , some of these ventures are flying on hope and speculation , and not on sound financial grounds . ] 9- SPAIN 'S CAPRICORNIA LAUNCHER STILL PROCEEDING In one of his last official acts , former President Bush authorized space technology transfer for several joint space ventures between US and other firms . One of these was a proposed use of US technology by Spain to build a small booster . With that regulatory impediment removed , the 3-stage Capricornia launch vehicle will start development later this year , planning for a first launch in the 1995/96 time period . The Capricornia is described as a small 3-stage all solid booster designed to put 250-500 Kg into LEO . Several launch sites are being examined for the system , including 2 on the Iberian peninsula and 1 on the Canary Islands . Originated by INTA in Spain , the project reports it has $ 30 M in development funding , and will use technology from Argentina 's Condor launch vehicle as well as from the US . [ Commentary : Several firms have identified a market opportunity in providing a small launcher for the European market . Small payloads from European firms or organizations currently use either Ariane piggyback launches or the US/Italian Scout launcher . However , Ariane piggyback opportunities are limited , and the Scout program is being phased out ( accompanied by some disarray in the Italian government and space industry regarding any follow-on system ) . This has left an apparent niche for a new European small launch system . Surprisingly enough , ESA has not supported development of such a system within the current space funding structure . Studies have been performed by British Aerospace , Aerospatiale , Deutsche Aerospace , and Italian organizations , but with the exception of the Swedish/PacAstro system ( reported below ) , I have not been able to find any other European development work with even a rumor of funding for hardware . Also of interest is the linking of the Capricornia to the Argentinian Condor launcher . There have been some interesting rumors surfacing out of Argentina over the past year about a space launcher/IRBM program funded under the military junta which ruled the country in the 1970 's and early 1980 's . What is known is in Feb 1992 , the Argentinian Air Force formally transferred control of the Condor 2 missile program to the new civilian Argentinian national space agency ( Comison Nacional de Atividades Espaciales - CNAE ) . The Condor 2 program was described as originating in 1983 , expanding upon the smaller Condor 1 rocket program in collaboration with Egypt and with support of German firms . The Condor 2 was also reportedly funded indirectly by Iraq in the mid-1980 's . Fairly large solid rocket motors were built and tested , but Argentinan development of a suitable guidance package lagged that of the propulsion system . It should be noted CNAE is planning to launch its first scientific satellite in late 1994 . The US $ 9 M , 181 Kg , SAC-B satellite will study the Earth 's upper atmosphere and includes cooperative experiments from Italy and the US . No launch vehicle has yet been selected , but OSC 's Pegasus and the Russian Burlak Air launched rocket are reported to be strong contenders for this contract . ] 10- PACASTRO SIGNS LAUNCH RESERVATION WITH SWEDISH SPACE CORP PacAstro , a small launch firm in Herndon , Virginia announced in late February it had received a $ 6 M launch reservation contract from the Swedish Space Corp to launch a satellite on PacAstro 's PA-2 launch vehicle . This will be performed as part of the Polar Satellite Service ( PSS ) , a joint Norwegian Space Center/ Swedish Space Corp. program to upgrade the Andoya Rocket Range in Norway and offering small satellite launches into the polar regions . According to PacAstro , PSS is also performing an $ 8 M upgrade of the Andoya launch facilities , including a new integration facility and a fully- enclosed vertical assembly building for small launch vehicles like the PacAstro PA-2 . PacAstro has been chosen as `` the main alternative rocket supplier '' for the small satellite launch service to be offered by PSS from Andoya . The date of the launch of the Swedish satellite was not specified . [ Commentary : PacAstro has been trying to line up customers and funding for their launch vehicle for some time now . The PA-2 is a small , two stage rocket fueled by RP-1 and Liquid Oxygen . From PacAstro 's literature , the engines designed for the PA-series rockets are built of `` off the shelf '' components based upon the Lunar MOdule Descent Engines built by TRW , and are capable of putting a 225 Kg satellite into a 750 km circular polar orbit . PacAstro is trying to arrange construction financing for its first three PA-2 vehicles , with a first launch planned for 1995 , and 2 orbital launches planned for 1996 . My records show PacAstro hired TRW to provide marketing support and systems design , with primary engineering to be done by AeroAstro , a small satellite builder closely associated with PacAstro ( headquartered in the same building ) . The Swedish Space Corporation would supply engineering , launch operations , vehicle subsystems , and marketing support . Sumitomo Corp. of Tokyo , is a first round investor and sits on the board of directors . PacAstro has gotten a first round financial package of at least $ 550 K ( Some sources place this of high as $ 1 M ) , but has been searching for about a year for the additional $ 20-30 M needed to design , build and launch their first set of vehicles . The launch reservation from SSC can possibly be used to help bring some investors on board , but by my estimate , they will need much more than the single $ 6 M sale to put their venture into real hardware . ] 11- CHINA AND TAIWAN JOINT SATELLITE VENTURE REPORTED In early March , it was reported a joint satellite communications venture between a Taiwanese and mainland Chinese was in the works . As reported in the Taipei press , China Development Corp. ( CDC ) , headquartered in Taiwam and with links to the ruling Nationalist Party , is planning to set up a joint venture in Hong Kong with China Great Wall Industry Corp. with the objective of launching a regional communications satellite . CDC would cover about 10 % of the satellite system cost ( US $ 10 M ) in exchange for rights to 10 % of the satellite 's communications channels . [ Commentary : This announcement came close on the heels of the release of Taiwanese plans for space development ( released in mid January ) . In those plans , the National Space Program Office of Taiwan will launch 3 satellites , starting with ROCSAT-1 , a 400 Kg scientific spacecraft , planned for launch in 1997 . Two additional satellites are planned , both communications satellites . TRW has been helping Taiwan plan this program , budgeted at T $ 13.6 B ( US $ 530 M ) through 2006 . I have n't been able to establish any relationship between this venture and those of the NSPOT , but there might be a connection . While Taiwan has the financing to pursue several ventures , the current Taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two separate sastellite ventures . The reported name for the Tiawanese/Chinese system is `` Asiasat- 2 '' , but I do n't thinks this has any relationship with the existing Hong Kong-based `` Asiasat '' program involving Chinese , Hong Kong , and other Asian investors , other than using it as an organizational model . There are some obvious advantages to pursuing such a joing venture -- it could provide excellent first-hand experience to Taiwan for a very low cost , which then can be used in later satellite ventures . But there are internal political issues between Taiwanese and Chinese ventures , but putting any joint venture through a Hong Kong intermediary corporation might allow it to proceed . In any case , the East Asian satellite market is lighting up with substantially growth projected in space services and revenues . This is just another indicator to add to the list . ] 12- SOUTH KOREA ANNOUNCES NATIONAL MOVE INTO SPACE TECHNOLOGIES South Korea 's Trade , Industry and Resources Ministry recently announced plans to invest US $ 22 B in research and development and another US $ 17 B into manufacturing and research facilities for advanced aerospace technologies . Space technologies have been specifically targeted as part of this program , beginning with manufacture and launch of an advanced multi-purpose satellite by 1997 . The objective of this investment is to raise South Korea 's aerospace technology to the level of the world 's top 10 countries by 2000 . [ Commentary : South Korea has been quietly working to develop its national aerospace industry , specifically including space activities . I 'm noting this as a flag that potential new players are coming into the commercial space market . As part of their national effort , 2 national telecommunications satellites for Korea Telecom will be launched in April and Oct 1995 on Delta . Designated Koreasat 1 and 2 , the platforms will provide television and telephone service throughout the Korean Peninsula , southwestern Japan and portions of China bordering North Korea . South Korea launched its first small satellite piggyback on Ariane in Aug 1992 , called Uribyol-1 ( Our Star ) and costing about US $ 8.8 M. Uribyol-2 is planned for piggyback launch in October of this year , again on Ariane , and will be entirely `` made in Korea . '' Uribyol-3 , projected for a 1995 launch , will be an environment- monitoring micro-satellite . This satellite may be the precursor to a series of small Earth observation satellites , The KEOS ( Korean Earth Observation System ) project , which has been submitted for approval to the South Korean government , would use two or three 300-kg spacecraft equipped with optical and microwave sensors . South Korean press reports claim there is also a parallel military effort to establish the capabilities for building and launching small military satellites by 2001 . Supposedly a government panel had been established to oversee such an effort , funded at US $ 500 M between 1993 and 2001 , in anticipation of an expected pullout of U.S. intelligence-gathering systems from the Korean peninsula . In conjunction with all of these reported efforts , South Korean is also pursuing production work either as off-sets to existing aerospace technology contracts ( for example , McDonnell Douglas is offsetting production of some Delta parts to South Korean firms as part of the Koreasat launch contracts ) , or for production of consumer space items ( among other products , South Korea exports satellite receiver television setups to Japan , and Samsung has announced teaming for production of OSC 's Orbcomm user terminals. ) . This looks like a very aggressive push into space technologies . Considering that East Asia is currently the fastest growing sector for commercial space services ( primarily for telecommunications ) , a South Korean push into space technologies may change the composition of commercial space market there over the next decade . ] 13- SPACE TECHNOLOGY INDEXES THROUGH MARCH As announced in the last CSN/STI , each issue will give the results of stock indexes and portfolios regarding space stocks and investments . The table below summarizes results to the end of March . The Space Technology Index did quite a bit better than the market as a whole , as represented by the S & P 500 index . Since 90+ % of the values included in the index are US firms , this represents a general increase in the market value of space-related firms . The increase in the first quarter is more than in all of 1992 -- which is a very promising sign , although future months may reverse this trend . The Commercial Space Technology Index has also done quite well , but the Pure Play portfolio -- consisting of stocks of firms which are pure plays in space technologies -- has also surpassed its results in all of 1993 . We 'll keep an eye on these ... .

However , I do n't know anyone who has one . I have my eye on two choices . Dexxa : This scanner is available at Wal-Mart for $ 90 . It includes GrayWorks software and provides 400 dpi and 32 grayscales ( I think ) . The OCR software Catchword is available through mail-order for about $ 90 also . Mustek : ( Gray Artist for Windows ) This scanner offers 256 grayscales ( according to Cad & Graphics ) and 800 dpi . It is available for $ 169 mail-order and comes with Perceive OCR and Picture Publisher LE . I am also looking at a Genius hand scanner ( B105 ) from Cad & Graphics . It is basically the same as the Mustek scanner except for the resolution ( 400 dpi ) and price ( $ 149 ) . Basically , I would like recommendations on which to buy . I have heard that Logitech makes the best and manufactures Dexxa scanners . But which one is the best buy ? Would 800 dpi really be helpful ( output would be no better than HP LaserJet III or Canon BJ-200 - 300x300 to 360x360 ) ? I am leaning toward the Mustek because it offers the most features and is in the middle in terms of prices . Which should I buy ? If you have a hand scanner , please let me know whether or not you would recommend it . Also , if you know of another scanner within the price range ( under $ 225 ) that would be a better deal , please E-Mail me . Any and all help would be greatly appreciated . - Kevin Harter

It is not even April 1 anymore . If this is true , I think it 's a great idea . Learning how to build to build structures in space in an essential step towards space development , and given that Freedom appears to be shrinking towards the vanishing point , I question whether NASA 's space station is going to provide much , if any , knowledge in this area .

The DC-X vehicle is a 1/3 scale vehicle designed to test some of the concepts invovled in SSTO . It is currently undergoing tests . The DC-Y vehicle would be a full scale experimental vehicle capable of reaching orbit . It has not yet been funded . On April 6th , Rocky Nelson of MacDonnell Douglas gave a talk entitled '' Optimizing Techniques for Advanced Space Missions '' here at the University of Illinois . Mr Nelson 's job involves using software to simulate trajectories and determine the optimal trajectory within given requirements . Although he is not directly involved with the Delta Clipper project , he has spent time with them recently , using his software for their applications . He thus used the DC-Y project for most of his examples . While I do n't think the details of implicit trajectory simulation are of much interest to the readers ( I hope they are n't - I fell asleep during that part ) , I think that many of you will be interested in some of the details gleaned from the examples . The first example given was the maximization of payload for a polar orbit . The main restriction is that acceleration must remain below 3 Gs . I assume that this is driven by passenger constraints rather than hardware constraints , but I did not verify that . The Delta Clipper Y version has 8 engines - 4 boosters and 4 sustainers . The boosters , which have a lower isp , are shut down in mid-flight . Thus , one critical question is when to shut them down . Mr Nelson showed the following plot of acceleration vs time : ______ 3 G /| / | / | / | As ASCII graphs go , this is actually fairly / | / | good . The big difference is that the lines 2 G / |/ | made by the / should be curves which are / | concave up . The data is only approximate , as / | the graph was n't up for very long . 1 G / | | | 0 G | ^ ^ ~100 sec ~400 sec As mentioned before , a critical constraint is that G levels must be kept below 3 . Initially , all eight engines are started . As the vehicle burns fuel the accelleration increases . As it gets close to 3G , the booster engines are throtled back . However , they quickly become inefficient at low power , so it soon makes more sense to cut them off altogether . This causes the dip in accelleration at about 100 seconds . Eventually the remaining sustainer engines bring the G level back up to about 3 and then hold it there until they cut out entirely . The engine cutoff does not acutally occur in orbit . The trajectory is aimed for an altitude slightly higher than the 100nm desired and the last vestiges of air drag slow the vehicle slightly , thus lowering the final altitude to that desired . Questions from the audience : ( paraphrased ) Q : Would it make sense to shut down the booster engines in pairs , rather than all at once ? A : Very perceptive . Worth considering . They have not yet done the simulation . Shutting down all four was part of the problem as given . Q : So what was the final payload for this trajectory ? A : Ca n't tell us . `` Read Aviation Leak . '' He also apparently had a good propulsion example , but was told not to use it . My question : Does anyone know if this security is due to SDIO protecting national security or MD protecting their own interests ? The second example was reentry simulation , from orbit to just before the pitch up maneuver . The biggest constraint in this one is aerodynamic heating , and the parameter they were trying to maximize was crossrange . He showed graphs of heating using two different models , to show that both were very similar , and I think we were supposed to assume that this meant they were very accurate . The end result was that for a polar orbit landing at KSC , the DC-Y would have about 30 degrees of crossrange and would start it 's reentry profile about 60 degrees south latitude . I would have asked about the landing maneuvers , but he did n't know about that aspect of the flight profile . -- Josh Hopkins jbh55289 @ uxa.cso.uiuc.edu `` Find a way or make one .

I recall , before we did anything for Somalia , ( apparent ) left-wingers saying that the reason everyone was more willing to send troops to Bosnia than to Somalia was because the Somalis are third-worlders who Americans consider unworthy of help . They suddenly shut up when the US decided to send troops to the opposite place than that predicted by the theory . For that matter , this theory of yours suggests that Americans should want to help the Serbs . After all , they 're Christian , and the Muslims are not .

I 've implemented the ideas from the article above and I 'm very satisfied with the results . I needed it for my bezier curve approximation routine . In some cases ( generating offset curves ) loops can occur . I now have a fast method of detecting the generation of a curve with a loop . Although I did not follow the article above strictly . The check if the fourth control point lies in the the loop area , which is bounded by two parabolas and one ellips is too complicated . Instead I enlarged the loop-area and surrounded it by for straight lines . The check is now simple and fast and my approximation routine never ever outputs self-intersecting bezier curves again !

I 'm looking for recommendations for a suitable replacement . I would like to buy a full Aerostich suit but I ca n't afford $ 700 for it right now . I 'm considering two basic options : 1 ) Buy the Aerostich jacket only . Dunno how much it costs due to recent price increases , but I 'd imagine over $ 400 . That may be pushing my limit . Advantages include the fact that I can later add the pants , and that it nearly eliminates the need for the jacket portion of a rainsuit . 2 ) Buy some kind of leather jacket . I like a few of the new Hein-Gericke FirstGear line , however they may be a bit pricey unless I can work some sort of deal . Advantages of leather are potentially slightly better protection , enhanced pose value ( we all know how important that is : - ) , possibly cheaper than upper Aerostich . Requirements for a jacket are that it must fit over a few other layers ( mainly a sizing thing ) , if leather i 'd prefer a zip-out lining , it MUST have some body armor similar to aerostich ( elbows , shoulders , forearms , possibly back/kidney protection , etc . ) , a reasonable amount of pocket space would be nice , ventilation would be a plus , however it must be wearable in cold weather ( below freezing ) with layers or perhaps electrics .

Apparantly it 's not as clear to Charles Ryrie as it is to you . 2 Timothy 3:16-17 All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching , for reproof , for correction , for training in righteousness ; that the man of God may be adequate , equipped for every good work . Galations 1:11-12 For I would have you know , brethren , that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man . For I neither received it from man , nor was I taught it , but I receieved it through a revelation of Jesus Christ . When I read these passages , it was not immediately clear to me what every phrase meant . I had stop and think about the possible connotations of words , what the intent of the author may have been , wonder if the translator used the correct English word to convey the same meaning : I had to interpret . If you want to believe that your are not interpreting Scripture as you read , there 's probably nothing I can say to change your mind . But I think it 's naive to think that our culture , experiences , education , do not affect everything we read . > Also , based on the fact that Jesus is the Word incarnate and he judges > people if they follow him ( see Acts 17:29-31 and John 5:21-27 ) and that > those who reject Jesus ' teachings are judged by the very words he spoke > ( see John 12:47-50 ) , then Jesus ' words are true and do not need > interpretation , nor would it be just of God to judge based on his word > if it had to be interpreted . In college , I took an entire course in Biblical interpretation . Go to any Christian bookstore , there are scores of books on interpreting and understanding Scripture . If interpretation is unnecessary , there are an awful lot of misguided Christians out there wasting a lot of time and energy on it . Carol Alvin caralv @ auto-trol.com

Sure , it 's been cold , the food lines were long , and the hired hands were surly , but this was all part of the Giants mystique . Or so I thought . I went to Tuesday 's game ( 3 - 1 Giants over the Marlins ) and the 'Stick was a much different place . Nothing short of a dome will eliminate the wind , but everything is a lot better . The lines are a lot shorter , the bathrooms are CLEAN and have running water , and the hired hands were very polite . The new foghorn ( lights up and blows after each homerun ) and the wooden fence are very nice , as are the new bleachers . The bleachers start right at the top of the fence and give a great view , and they 've got beer stands at the bottome of the bleachers . The only complaint is that the electronic old-fashioned scoreboard looks electronic - could be better . These things should have been done a long time ago , but it took a real businessman ( ex - Safeway President Peter Magowan ) to figure it out . Just like he used to tell his checkers , `` If the customers do n't come back , I don't need as many checkers '' . This is n't a knock on Bob Lurie - he was a competent businessman but he did n't deal much with the general public . I 'll give an example of how the level of service has changed . The onion dispenser jammed as I was using it . An attendant came over , apoligized for the problem and proceeded to fix the machine . After he was done , he cleaned the machine and said he was glad to be able to help .

Center for Regional Studies Lines : 57 4/15/93 1242 Turkey sends light weapons as aid to Azerbaijan By SEVA ULMAN ANKARA , Turkey ( UPI ) -- Turkey is arming Azerbaijan with light weapons to help it fight Armenian forces in the struggle for the Nagorno- Karabakh enclave , the newspaper Hurriyet said Thursday . Deputy Prime Minister Erdal Inonu told reporters in Ankara that Turkey was responding positively to a request from Azerbaijan for assistance . `` We are giving a positive response to all requests '' from Azerbaijan , `` within the limits of our capabilities , '' he said . Foreign Ministry spokesman Vural Valkan declined to elaborate on the nature of the aid being sent to Azerbaijan , but said they were within the framework of the Council for Security and Cooperation in Europe . Hurriyet , published in Istanbul , said Turkey was sending light weapons to Azerbaijan , including rockets , rocket launchers and ammunition . Ankara began sending the hardware after a visit to Turkey last week by a high-ranking Azerbaijani official . Turkey has however ruled out , for the second time in one week , that it would intervene militarily in Azerbaijan . Wednesday , Inonu told reporters Ankara would not allow Azerbaijan to suffer defeat at the hands of the Armenians . `` We feel ourselves bound to help Azerbaijan , but I am not in a position right now to tell you what form ( that ) help may take in the future , '' he said . He said Turkish aid to Azerbaijan was continuing , `` and the whole world knows about it . '' Prime Minister Suleyman Demirel reiterated that Turkey would not get militarily involved in the conflict . Foreign policy decisions could not be based on street-level excitement , he said . There was no immediate reaction in Ankara to regional reports , based on Armenian sources in Yerevan , saying Turkish pilots and other officers were captured when they were shot down flying Azerbaijani warplanes and helicopters . The newspaper Cumhuriyet said Turkish troops were digging in along the border with Armenia , but military sources denied reports based on claims by local people that gunfire was heard along the border . No military action has occurred , the sources said . The latest upsurge in fighting between the Armenians and Azerbaijanis flared early this month when Armenian forces seized the town of Kelbajar and later positioned themselves outside Fizuli , near the Iranian border . -- David Davidian dbd @ urartu.sdpa.org | `` How do we explain Turkish troops on S.D.P.A .

Deir Yassin was on the road to Jerusalem , which the Arabs had blockaded , and it housed Iraqi troups and Palestinian irregulars . Snipers based in Deir Yassin were a constant threat to Jewish citizens in Jerusalem . `` Arab civilians were killed at Deir Yassin , but that attack does not conform to the propaganda picture that the Arabs have tried to paint . The number of Arabs killed was generally reported to be about 250 . In 1983 , however , Eric Silver of _The Guardian_ ( Britain ) interviewed a survivor , Mophammed Sammour , who testified that 116 out of a population of 800-1000 were killed . 'About three days after the massacre , ' Sammour explained , 'representatives of each of the five clans in Deir Yassin met at the Moslem offices in Jerusalem and made a list of the people who had not been found ( alive ) . We went through the names . Nothing has happend since 1948 to make me think this figure was wrong . ' `` Unlike the PLO 's deliberate attacks on civilians , the killing of civilians at Deir Yassin was not premeditated . The attackers left open an escape corridor from the village and more than 200 residents left unharmed . After the remaining Arabs feigned surrender and then fired on the Jewish troops , some of the attackers killed Arab soldiers and civilians indiscriminately . Independent observers told _The Guardian_ that among the bodies they found Arab men disguised as women . ''

This however , contradicts what the Bible > says . The Bible teaches that not everyone is a child of God : > It always cracks me up when anti-Mormons presume to tell Mormons what they believe . Mormons do , in fact , believe that all people , including Christ and Lucifer , are children of God in the sense that we were all created ( or organized or whatever ) by Him . We also believe that being `` offspring '' of God has a symbolic sense when applied to being spiritually `` born again '' of Him . Thus the same word can be used to convey different meanings .

On the contrary , Robert , it is not a red herring at all to show that those who rely wholly on the Bible can not seem to agree on what it says .

On the contrary , Robert , if you are quoting McConkie 's words as Mormon canon then the question of whether they are canon or not is of *great* importance . The fact is that they are not .

E.G . homoeopathy : like cures like . The more you dilute things , the more powerful they get , even if you dilute them so much there is no ingredient but water left . Chiropractic : all illness stems from compressions of nerves by misaligned vertebrae . Such systems are so patently absurd , that any good they do is accidental and not related to the theory . The only exception is probably herbalism , because scientists recognize the potent drugs that derive from plants and are always interested in seeing if they can find new plants that have active and useful substances . But that is n't what is meant by alternative medicine , usually . If you get into the Qi , accupuntunce charts , etc , you are now back to silly theories that probably have nothing to do with why accupuncture works in some cases . Perhaps another reason they are reluctant is the Rhine experience .

I do n't know what a `` low grade '' fusion reactor is , but the major problem with 3He ( aside from the difficulty in making any fusion reactor work ) is that its concentration in lunar regolith is just so small -- on the order of 5 ppb or so , on average ( more in some fractions , but still very small ) . Massive amounts of regolith would have to be processed . This thread reminds me of Wingo 's claims some time ago about the moon as a source of titanium for use on earth . As I recall , Wingo wasn't content with being assured that titanium ( at .5 % in the Earth 's crust , average ) would not run out , and touted lunar mines , even though the market price of ilmenite concentrate these days is around $ .06/pound . This prompted me to look up large potential terrestrial sources . On the moon , titanium occurs in basalts ; `` high-Ti '' basalts ( Apollo 11 and 17 ) have 8-14 % titanium dioxide ( by weight ) . This is nice , but ... terrestrial continental flood basalts are also typically enriched in titanium . They very often have 3 % TiO2 , frequently have 4 % , and sometimes even 5 % TiO2 ( again , by weight ) . These flood basalts are *enormous* -- millions of cubic kilometers , scattered all over the world ( Siberia , Brazil , the NW United States , Ethiopia , etc. ) . If even 1 % of the basalts are 5 % TiO2 , this is trillions of tons of TiO2 at concentrations only a factor of 2-3 less than in lunar high-Ti basalts . It is difficult to see how the disadvantages of the moon could be overcome by such a small increase the concentration of the ore ( never mind the richer , but less common , terrestrial ores being mined today ) .

This description 1. ignores the role of the ballast , 2. misrepresents the heating effects in the starter . The bimetalic strip cools down immediately after the contacts short circuit , because the neon discharge stops , and much less heat is generated from the I^2R loss in the metal as compared to the neon discharge . The starter contacts open before the tube fires . Actually , the tube fires as a result of the back-emf generated in the ballast because of this immediate opening of the starter 's contacts . A capacitor is connected in parallel with the contacts to prevent excessive arcing during the firing . The neon reionizes but does not draw sufficient current to prevent firing of the tube itself . -- Mustafa Kocaturk mustafa @ seas.smu.edu EE Dept. , Room 305A , Caruth Bldg .

Then you must be living in an alternate universe . Where were they ? An Appeal to Mankind During the last three years Azerbaijan and its multinational population are vainly fighting for justice within the limits of the Soviet Union . All humanitarian , constitutional human rights guaranteed by the UN Charter , Universal Declaration of Human Rights , Helsinki Agreements , Human Problems International Forums , documents signed by the Soviet Union - all of them are violated . The USSR 's President , government bodies do not defend Azerbaijan though they are all empowered to take necessary measures to guarantee life and peace . The 140,000 strong army of Armenian terrorists with Moscow's tacit consent wages an undeclared war of annihilation against Azerbaijan . As a result , a part of Azerbaijan has been occupied and annexed , hundreds of people killed , thousands wounded . Some 200,000 Azerbaijanis have been brutally and inhumanly deported from the Armenian SSR , their historical homeland . Together with them 64,000 Russians and 22,000 Kurds have also been driven out , a part of them now settled in Azerbaijan . Some 40,000 Turkish-Meskhetians , Lezghins and representatives of other Caucasian nationalities who escaped from the Central Asia where the President and government bodies did not guarantee them the life and peace also suffered from these deportations . One of the scandalous vandalisms directed not only against Azerbaijan science but the world civilization as well is the Armenian extremists ' destruction of the Karabakh scientific experimental base of The Institute of Genetics and Selection of the Academy of Sciences of the Azerbaijan SSR . We beg you for humanitarian help and political assistance , for the honour and dignity of 7 million Azerbaijanis are violated , its territory , culture and history are trampled , its people are shot . There is persistent negative image of Azerbaijanians abroad , and this defamation is spread over the whole world by Soviet mass media , Armenian lobby in the USSR and the United States . One of the myths is that all events allegedly involves and generated by interethnic collisions and religious intolerance while the truth is that all these shootings and recent events stem from the territorial claims of Armenia on Azerbaijan . It is a well documented fact that before the conflict there were no frictions between Armenians and Azerbaijanis on the issue of Karabakh . Hundreds and thousands Armenians placidly and calmly lived and worked in Azerbaijan land , had their representatives in all government bodies of the Azerbaijan SSR . We are for a united , indivisible , sovereign Azerbaijan , we are for a common Caucasian home proclaimed in 1918 by one of the founding fathers of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic - Muhammed Emin Rasulzade . But all these goals and expectations are trampled upon the Soviet leadership in favour of the Armenian expansionists encouraged by Moscow and intended to create a new ' 1,000 Year Reich ' - the 'Great Armenia ' - by annexing the neighboring lands . The world public opinion shed tears to save the whales , suffers for penguins dying out in the Antarctic Continent . But what about the lives of seven million human beings ? If these people are Muslims , does it mean that they are less valuable ? Can people be discriminated by their colour of skin or religion , by their residence or other attributes ? All people are brothers , and we appeal to our brothers for help and understanding . This is not the first appeal of Azerbaijan to the world public opinion . Our previous appeals were unheard . However , we still carry the hope that the truth beyond the Russian and Armenian propaganda will one day reveal the extent of our suffering and stimulate at least as much help and compassion for Azerbaijan as tendered to whales and penguins . THE COMMITTEE FOR PEOPLE 'S HELP TO KARABAKH ( OF THE ) ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE AZERBAIJAN SSR > Everyone knows this , even the Turks know this , you know this . Give > us a time period when the world is currently boring , and what is > happening in Armenia would make front page headlines . Think I 'm lying ? > Take a look at what happened in Somalia . When did the press report > it to the world ? But perhaps Turkiye should intervene in the affairs of the Caucasus in the name of peace and democracy . The Armenians are Christians , the Azerbaijanis are Moslems , and Islam is a religion especially unloved by the democrat-westernizers . Besides , at the root of this conflict lie the territorial claims on Azerbaijan , a consequence of which were the blood and suffering of innocent Azeri people , hundreds of thousands of refugees , and gross violations of human rights . Recently Armenians attacked the Azeri town of Khojaly and massacred thousands of Azeris . The Paris-based 'Association for Democracy and Human Rights in Azerbaijan ' puts the number of Khojali victims at 3,145 . Some of the dead were scalped and mutilated . This whole thing has now gone entirely too far . > Want to know what will bring the story in Armenia to the front > page ? If the Russians move into the area with a shit load of tanks > THEN your human rights advocates will show up defending the Armenians . > Of course we can also be sure that the Russians wo n't show up with > any tanks , not with the problems they are having at home . They already did . The scenario and genocide staged by the Armenians 78 years ago in the Ottoman Empire is being reenacted again - this time in Azerbaijan . There are remarkable similarities between the plots , the perpetrators , and the underdogs . Report taken from The New York Times , Tuesday , March 3 , 1992 MASSACRE BY ARMENIANS BEING REPORTED Agdam , Azerbaijan , March 2 ( Reuters ) - Fresh evidence emerged today of a massacre of civilians by Armenian militants in Nagorno-Karabakh , a predominantly Armenian enclave of Azerbaijan . The republic of Armenia reiterated denials that its militants had killed 1,000 people in the Azerbaijani populated town of Khojaly last week and massacred men , women and children fleeing the carnage across snow-covered mountain passes . But dozen of bodies scattered over the area lent credence to Azerbaijani reports of a massacre . Scalping Reported Azerbaijani officials and journalists who flew briefly to the region by helicopter brought back three dead children with the back of their heads blown off . They said shooting by Armenians has prevented them from retrieving more bodies . `` Women and children have been scalped , '' said Assad Faradshev , an aide to Nagorno-Karabakh 's Azerbaijani Governor . `` When we began to pick up bodies , they began firing at us . '' The Azerbaijani militia chief in Agdam , Rashid Mamedov , said : `` The bodies are lying there like flocks of sheep . Even the fascists did nothing like this . '' Truckloads of Bodies Near Agdam on the outskirts of Nagorno-Karabakh , a Reuters photographer , Frederique Lengaigne , said she had seen two trucks filled with Azerbaijani bodies . `` In the first one I counted 35 , and it looked as though there were as many in the second , '' she said . `` Some had their head cut off , and many had been burned . They were all men , and a few had been wearing khaki uniforms .

It is speach that some find questionable that must be protected , be it religiously blasphemous or inherently racist . It is only through civilized discourse and not scare tactics that one can enlighten those that one perceives to be ignorant . That is the idea behind freedom of expression .

One Friday , one Saturday , and a good-old Sunday doubleheader . `` What could be better , '' declared Ernie Banks . Perhaps the fact that the Cubs are challenging ? `` It 's pitching , it 's always been pitching that we 've lacked , '' announced Ryne Sandberg . `` If we can get by Brewer , then beat Carlton , Alexander , or Bunning - preferrably 2 of the last three - we 'll know we might be able to win . `` Lord , I hope we pull it off . '' The Phils scored once in the top of the first ; Richie Ashburn singled , Pete Rose followed with a hit , sending Ashburn around second . Kiki Cuyler cut the ball off in left center , and threw a bullet in to Ernie Banks , who threw to Ron Santo to get Ashburn at third . Rose went to second on the play . Christobel Torrienti lifted a long fly to center , moving Pete Rose to third . Schmidt was walked - the Cubs were absolutely refusing to let him beat them . Both Torrienti and Schmidt will likely draw 130-150 walks this year . Chuck Klein is starting to hit very well , and he lashed a double into a gap in right-center . `` Cool Papa '' Bell 's speed allowed him to cut the ball off and prevent Schmidt from scoring . Nellie Fox was walked , and Bob Boone grounded out to second , ending the threat . `` Teams are starting to realize that you do n't have to pitch to Schmidt or Torrienti , and that is lowering their run total . It puts a lot of pressure on Klein and Dick Allen ( who platoons with Chuck Klein and occasionally spells Rose at first ) , and it 's a credit to the Phillies that they 've been able to sustain their pace . The picthers have slumped at times . '' So came the analysis from Frank Chance . The Cubs got that run back when Bell bunted for a hit , Thomas ' grounder moved him to second , and - after Sandberg made out - Billy Williams singled home a run . In the sixth , Ron Santo launched a two-run homer to make it 3-1 . Dick Redding got in trouble in the eighth , as Schmidt singled and Klein singled him to third . Ed Reulbach entered to face Fox , but Dick Allen popped out of the dugout to hit . Allen doubled to right , but luckily for the Cubs , Williams had moved to left and Andre Dawson had been inserted for defense . He fired a bullet to home plate to keep Klein at third . Lance Parrish , hitting for Boone , was walked , and Bruce Sutter entered . Larry Bowa grounded into a 1-2-3 double play , but Ed Delahanty walked as a pinch-hitter . Desiring a strikeout , since Ashburn was likely to attempt a bunt hit with the quick Trillo pinch-running at third , Chance brought in Lee Smith , who induced a pop-up to the catcher from the speedy centerfielder , ending the inning . The Cubs took the win , 3-2 , moving a game behind the Phillies . Steve Carlton was called upon to battle 3-Finger Brown Saturday . To get another righthander in the lineup , Ron Santo moved to first and Bill Madlock played third . Unfortunately , Brown allowed six doubles , and the Cub bullpen was worn down even more , as the Cubs tried to maintain a lead against Lefty . Madlock , batting sixth , had knocked two doubles of his own , driving home four runs . Gabby Hartnett hit two home runs , and Cuyler added another , and the score was 8-6 , Cubs after six innings . The Phillie bullpen had more troubles in the bottom of the eighth , as the Cubs grabbed 3 more runs to ice an 11-7 triumph . Sunday 's twin bill saw Cool Papa Bell gather seven straight hits at one point , including a rare outside-the-park home run in the second game , off Robin Roberts . Grover Alexander of the Phils took the first contest , 4-2 , but the Cubs captured the second one 5-4 , with Waddell gaining the win . Bruce Sutter tossed two innings for the save , though he allowed one run in the eighth . The Cardinals stood half a game behind these co-leaders , and would conclude their series with the Expos on Monday . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Montreal at St. Louis ( August 3-6 ) : 3-way tie for 1st Dennis Martinez is on a roll , and he continued it versus John Tudor Friday . The Expos have a wide variety of hitters , and - while they are n't among the all-time greats , they are getting the job done . After winning their first first two games , they suddenly found themselves only 2 1/2 games out of first in this wacky season . Martinez triumphed 5-3 on Friday , and WIlliams outdueled Dizzy Dean 3-2 Saturday . However , the Cardinals refused to give up , winning 6-2 on Sunday . The Cards captured Monday 's game , too , as Steve Carlton outdueled Steve Rogers 3-2 . `` We 're really good against ground ball pitchers because of our team speed , '' remarked Lou Brock . `` I do n't see why we ca n't win this division .

Keith Hernandez added that `` their defense takes away quite a few runs per year , and it must be giving them an extra 6-7 wins . '' The Pirates have made only 26 errors all season , 6 ahead of the second place Dodgers . Error totals tend to be around 50 for the best defensive All-Time teams . Rube Foster defeated Sid Fernandez 5-2 Friday , and Candelaria outshone Seaver 3-2 Saturday , in a game featuring some outstanding defense . When Nolan Ryan and two relivers 6-hit the Mets in another 3-2 win Sunday , the Pirates could once again look forward to a victory getting them back to the .500 mark . They had been unable to several times in the past month . Bert Blyleven met Dwight Gooden in the afternoon game . Both pitchers possessed fantastic stuff , and the only runs scored through eight innings were on home runs - a solo shot by Rusty Staub of the Mets and a two-run blast by Ralph Kiner for the Pirates . The Mets ' Darryl Strawberry singled home a run in the top of the ninth off Jesse Orosco , working his second inning , after Mookie Wilson pinch-ran for Gary Carter at second . With one out and a runner on first , Lee Mazilli was sent in to pinch-hit . The Pirates countered with Kent Tekulve , placing him in the fifth spot in the order and putting Barry Bonds in left field as the ninth place hitter . Tekulve induced a groundout forcing Strawberry at second . He slid hard into Honus Wagner , preventing the Pirates from turning their fifth double play of the afternoon . Tekulve allowed a hit , but Clemente threw Mazilli out at third from near the right field line , ending the inning . Tug McGraw relieved Randy Myers , who entered to pitch the eighth , and got one out before Bonds launched a rocket to deep center , running through the stop sign at third to score an inside-the-park homer to win . The Pirates had scored an improbable 3 straight 3-2 wins , and had moved to within 2 games of first place , with seven weeks to go . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- San Francisco at Boswaukta ( August 3-5 ) : Another Sunday doubleheader appeared on the schedule , as the Giants managed to close the gap on the other teams thanks to some starting pitching that just would n't tire . In fact , reported manager John McGraw , '' once this rough part of the schedule is over , maybe as early as this coming week , we may shift to a 4-man rotation again for a little while . '' Juan Marichal continued his hot pitching Friday , beating Lew Burdette and the Braves 4-1 . Willie Mays had all four r.b.i.s on 3 hits . Rick Reuschel faced Joe Niekro Saturday in a slugfest . The Braves ' park had been a homer haven , but this took the cake , as the Giants won a seesaw affair 16-13 . Willie Mays had three homers , Willie McCovey , Eddie Matthews , and Don Baylor had two , and Hank Aaron , Ernie Lombardi , Biz Mackey , and Mel Ott had one each . The Braves had collected 149 home runs going into Sunday's doubleheader , putting them on a pace for 223 , which would be 4 short of the National League record . They were still a tad behind the '61 Yankees ' pace . They had allowed over 120 , though . Vida Blue actually got the win after retiring 2 batters in the fifth . He allowed only a run in the sixth , but faltered in the seventh . Joe McGinnity earned the save . In the doubleheader , the Braves ' Hoyt Wilhelm failed to hold a lead in the first game , but Hank Aaron homered off Bill Foster in the eighth as the Braves won , 4-3 . The Giants took the second game , however , by a 6-2 score . The homer by Aaron was a magical # 150 by the Braves ; however , they fell to three game below .500 , making a comeback extremely unlikely . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - San Diego at Cincinnati ( Aug. 3-5 ) : Randy Jones faced Ewell Blackwell in the first of this 3-game series , and the Padres felt rather good . With Don Mattingly straining his back in the last Cleveland game , the trade looked even better . McGriff 's batting average was even rising . Of course , the bench was very poor , and Joe Gordon was only adequate in the outfield , but these were minor problems , since the pitching was holding up . Jones pitched a good game Friday , and won 6-3 . McGriff launched two home runs . Mel Harder earned a win with the help of Mark Davis and Ray Narleski Saturday ; 5-4 was the final score . Tom Candiotti battled Satchel Paige to a 3-3 tie through eight innings before departing . The game was scoreless for 4 more innings until the thirteenth . Paige had departed after 10 , and John Franco hurled a scoreless inning . Tom Browning was working his second scoreless inning , when Dave Winfield doubled with one out and Joe Gordon was pitched around . Thurm Munson doubled both runners home , and the Padres gamed a 5-3 win . The three-game sweep had pulled the Giants into a tie with the Reds . Though the Reds denied it , the highly emotional series with the Dodgers may have taken too much out of them . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Brookangeles at Houston ( August 3-5 ) : Another series capped off by a weekend doubleheader took place in the wide open plains of the Astrodome . The Astros sent Joe Niekro to the hill in the first game , opposite Don Drysdale . `` Normally , '' Drysdale remarked , `` I would be challenging hitter by being ready to throw at them . I ca n't afford to with this team , though ; we have to get our own runners going ; we can't afford to let the Astros beat us . '' He then winked and said : `` Well , maybe Davis will get decked once . '' The fact that Glenn Davis leads the team in homers with six ( ! ) is primarily why he would be decked , but it should be understood that his current pace would give him nine for the season . The hitting on this team is a little better , but the power is all doubles and triples . Still , Carl Furillo is the main reason no Astro home runs were hit over the weekend , as he threw two runners out trying for inside-the-park homers . For those unaware of the nastness of the Astros ' park , they have a 23-foot high gray wall all around the outfield ; balls must be hit into the seats to be home runs . The foul poles are 355 feet from home plate , but the alleys are 400 feet away , with center field at 420 feet . `` It 's as if some three-year-old threw a tantrum and told his playmates : 'If I ca n't hit home runs , nobody will hit home runs ' , '' remarked Roy Campanella . The Dodgers stole five bases Friday , but the Astros decided to revitalize the Baltimore chopping that had failed 6 weeks before ; for tonight , anyway , Davis , Jim Wynn , and Jose Cruz did not have to mess with their swings , according to the manager . After Poles and Willie Wells reached base via the Baltimore chop , Drysdale decked Jose Cruz with a pitch . He responded with a two-run double , but Wynn - playing first for Davis - popped up , and the Astros did n't score any more in that inning . They did score 3 in the fourth to erase a 3-2 deficit , and the Astros wound up winning 6-4 . They threatened to do even better the next game , as Tommy John would be their opponent . Walt Alston met privately with the starters at 6 A.M. before the game . `` I think I know how we can beat the Baltimore Chop , '' he explained . `` How can we do that , '' Pee Wee Reese wondered . `` They 're going to be beating the ball down , so we 've got to be ready to throw on the run . Steve will start at first to dig balls out of the dirt , but I want all of you to practice your barehanded picks and throws . We 'll go with a shallow infield almost the whole time . '' The plan almost worked . Mike Scott allowed only two runs through eight innings , but the Astros got three ; two of them scored when Bill Doran pushed a bunt into the outfield in the fourth with runners on second and third . 3-2 Astros was the final , with Dave Smith earning another save . The Dodgers scored a victory in the first game of the twin bill Sunday , as Nolan Ryan walked five , three of whom scored in a 4-1 Dodger win . Fernando Valenzuela lost the second game 4-2 to Don Sutton , however , as the Dodgers' thirteen stolen bases in the series proved to not be enough . `` We 're mostly a power team , '' remarked Ron Cey . `` Jackie and , when he plays , Maury Wills are our only real speed demons , though a couple other plays can do it now and then . We 're sunk in a place like the Astrodome . I guess that 's why they 're so successful there . '' Indeed , it seems that basestealing teams give them the most trouble in the dome . The 'Stros swiped 12 bases in 16 attempts , giving them 230 on the season .

( AP ) -- A police officer afraid he would be fired for allegedly assaulting a teen-ager walked into an auto body shop wher the youth worked , said `` You 're going to die '' and fatally shot him and two others , police said . A fourth youth was wounded . A fifth escaped injury by hiding under a car . The wounded youth ran about two blocks to a house after the shooting at about midnight Tuesday and called police .

From : renew @ blade.stack.urc.tue.nl ( Rene Walter ) Subject : CView answers Organization : MCGV Stack , Eindhoven University of Technology , the Netherlands . Lines : 66 NNTP-Posting-Host : blade.stack.urc.tue.nl Summary : some CView problems explained Keywords : Stupid Programming X-Newsreader : TIN [ version 1.1 PL6 ] A very kind soul has mailed me this reply for the bugs in CView . Since he is n't in the position to post this himself , he asked me to post it for him , but to leave his name out . So here it comes : CView has quite a number of bugs . The one you mention is perhaps the most annoying , but not the most dangerous . As far as I can determine , it has to do with the temp files that CView creates . CView gives the user no control over where it places its temp files : it just places them in its '' current directory '' . The problem you mention occurs ( as far as I can tell ) when it runs out of disk space for its temp files . It seems as if CView does n't check properly for this situation . As Cview decodes a jpeg , it seems to write out a temp file with all the pixel data with 24 bit colour information . Then , for 8 bit displays , it does the `` dithering '' , again writing another file with the 8 bit colour information . While it is writing this second file , it also writes the data to your colour card . Then when it does the last chunk of 8 bit data , it recopies all the data from the 8 bit file to your screen again . ( It does this last `` recopy '' operation for its '' fit to screen '' feature , even when this feature is not enabled . ) The result of this process is the following : 1 ) If it runs out of disk space when writing the first 24 bit file , all you ever see is as much data as it has room for , and the last bit of data is simply repeated over and over again because CView never realizes the disk has filled up and disk writes/reads are n't performed . 2 ) If it has enough room for the 24 bit data , but runs out of room for the 8 bit data , you see almost all of the picture as it does the dithering and writes to the screen card . However , then when it finishes the dithering and recopies the data from the 8 bit file to screen ( for whatever reason it does this ) one again just gets a repetition of the last chunk of data for which there was room on the disk . This is just a guess , but probably fairly accurate . At least the general idea is on track I think , although I have probably made errors in details about file I/O etc . The way around this is of course to clear up sufficient disk space . The temp files for large JPEG 's ( 1200x900 and bigger ) can be very large ( 3 Meg + 1 Meg ) . On some of the largest I have needed in excess of 6 Meg free disk space . CView has a much more serious bug : if you are trying to display a file from a floppy , and you change floppies while CView has some temp file open on the floppy , then CView in certain circumstances will write the directory ( and FAT table ? I ca n't remember ) for the removed floppy onto the newly inserted floppy , thus corruptimg the new floppy in a very serious , possibly unrevcoverable way . SO BE CAREFUL ! It is incredibly poor programming for a program to do this . On the other hand , when choosing files in the Open Files menu , CView insists on doing a few disk reads every time one moves the hi-lighter square . Incredibly annoying when it could do them all at once when it gets the directory info . And really , how much effort does it take to sort a directory listing ? With much thanks to the originator of this article . +=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=+ | Rene Walter | renew @ stack.urc.tue.nl | + -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -+ -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -+ | `` Will I drown in tears of sorrow , Is there hope for tomorrow , | | Will this world ever get better , Ca n't we all just live together | | I do n't wan na live in strife , I just wan na live my life | | I deserve to have a future ...

Nationwide , the immunization rate among toddlers is about 50 % , but it is reportedly as low as 10 % in some inner-city neighborhoods . I bet more than 10 % kids living in such neighborhoods are already covered by Medicaid . Here in Massachussets , we have had a universal immunization program , the kind of Clinton seems to be proposing , for many years ( two decades ? ) . Mass ' immunization rate is 65 % . What about the other 35 % ?

I do n't know how to say it best but you are gaurenteed that the price of the C650 is going to drop this year . This week 's MacWeek reports that Apple is probably planning a drop in August . My guess is that it may come sooner if Apple decides to change the price structure upon release of the multimedia units this summer . Your price looks pretty good at about $ 50 more then I payed for mine last month . I would have rather waited for one of the new machines this sommer ( like the Cyclone ) but the resale value of my IIci would have not been squat by then . Thus , financing forced me to purchase now . I 'm happy with the machine and wo n't feel betrayed at all when Apple cuts the price to less then $ 1000 next week ( heh ) . Bottome line : If the C650 does what you want , buy it . If you wait until the Cylcones come out for a price break then you might as well wait for the PowerPCs to come out for another price break and then the units which follow them . You may save some money but you 've lost a lot of time when you could have been using the computer . Face it , Apple 's prices are going to be in a continuous state of flux . At least they are n't going to try raising them again ( grin ) . -John Komp @ leonardo.src.honeywell.com

I 've got unix loaded on one of my pcs ( along with windogs ) and the OS can only use one of the two IDE drives at one time . It 's pretty ugly . If data is going from one drive to another , and if SCSI has the ability to perform that transfer without the data having to go through the CPU or main memory , then yes , that is the optimal way to do it . As far as I know , IDE ca n't do that . But when the CPU wants data from both drives ( data to be stored in main memory ) are you saying that SCSI can grab data from both drives at the same time *and* store/transfer that data to main memory also at the same time ?

A friend of mine just got a Maxtor 245 meg IDE drive for $ 320 . ( that 's 245 million bytes , or 234 mega-bytes ) . With the basic $ 20 interface , he gets close to 1 meg/sec transfer on his 286-20 . Does your figure include a few hundred $ $ $ for SCSI drivers ? > No , actually , we 're talking about SCSI being expensive simply because > nobody did a common interface for the PC . If they had a common ( read : > easily implemented ) method of adding scsi to a PC ( like as in a Sun or > Mac ) , then you 'd find SCSI the connection medium of choice . So you 're saying that SCSI would have been the default interface type , considering that the vast majority of PC 's do n't have cd-rom drives or tape backups or etc ? That most PC 's only have ( or had ) 1 hard drive and run DOS ? That SCSI hard drives cost a lot more than MFM or RLL drives at the time ? ( and how common were SCSI drives under 80 megs 4 to 10 years ago ? ) There 's a lot more than the lack of a common interface card that prevented SCSI from becoming the connection medium of choice . > : I wo n't argue that the SCSI standard makes for a good , well implimented > : data highway , but I still want to know why it intrinsically better > : ( than IDE , on an ISA bus ) when it comes to multi-tasking OS 's when > : managing data from a single SCSI hard drive . > > On a single drive , SCSI is more expensive . But on that point , is it faster ? This is what all this is about . Do you get more performance for the money . For all the people that will only have a single hard drive in their system ( regardless of the OS ) will the SCSI choice really give them more performance than IDE ? > But , you bought your PC for > expandibility , so , you 'd want to add more drives or whatever . True , but expandibility can also start on the bus , which means the option is there for cd-rom drives or tape backups that run off their own cards . > 1 .

From : nlu @ Xenon.Stanford.EDU ( Nelson Lu ) Subject : SHARKS REVIEW Part 5 : Left Wings Organization : Computer Science Department , Stanford University . Lines : 161 Apparently , Part 2 ( defensemen numbered 2 through 19 ) was lost when I posted it ; to make things worse , I lost my own copy . I have asked on the Sharks mailing list , on which it did get out , to see if someone can mail me a copy back . If someone responds , I will repost it when I get it ; otherwise , I will re-write it in a day or two and post it . Sorry about that . # 8 LARRY DEPALMA Season : 3rd Acquired : '91-92 , free agent from Minnesota Grade : I ( C-/D+ ) No netter/fan watching the Sharks , including me , knows where DePalma was at the end of the season ; the Sharks appeared to still have his rights , but he was n't in San Jose , he was n't in Kansas City , and his name has n't appeared on the waiver wire . And that kind of invisibility was prevalent for the most part for DePalma . After being called up October 30 against the Tampa Bay Lightning , DePalma had an excellent week , scoring 5 points in 3 games while playing good defense . Unfortunately , the 27-year-old DePalma then disappeared the rest of the way , getting just 3 more points in 15 more games , and generally looked lethargic and uninterested on both ends of the ice . He then was sent down to Kansas City , walked out from there , and was suspended and later reinstated when it was revealed that he was injured ; he then promptly disappeared from the watching eyes of Shark Bytes ( as the mailing list is now known to Sharks officials ) faithful , and neither the Sharks nor we miss him . # 10 JOHAN GARPENLOV Season : 3rd Acquired : '91-92 , trade with Detroit for D Bob McGill and 8th round pick in '92 entry draft from Vancouver Grade : A/A- After an early slump , Garpenlov was nothing short of inspirational the rest of the way , finishing with 66 points in 79 games , second highest total on the team , as he clicked well with team MVP Kelly Kisio and right wing Rob Gaudreau . Kisio got most of the credit , but Garpenlov , finishing second in the MVP voting , clearly demonstrated his playmaking and scoring skills , as he was seen making excellent centering passes as well as finishing passes to him by putting the puck past opposing goaltenders , getting a club-high 14 power- play goals . Contrary to his previous rep , Garpenlov also showed that despite his small size ( 5 ' 11 '' , 183 lbs . ) , he was willing to throw himself around when necessary , albeit not very successful yet . He also still needs to work on his defense , although he improved tremendously throughout the season , and was actually quite a good penalty killer by the end of the season . He will be a major key to the offense next year . # 15 DAVID BRUCE Season : 5th Acquired : '91-92 , from St. Louis in expansion draft Grade : I ( ? ) After a banner '91-92 , when he led the team in power-play goals ( 10 ) and was third in total scoring ( 38 points in 60 games ) , Bruce was bothered virtually all of this season with a groin injury , which kept him out of the lineup for all by 17 games this season . Of course , it is difficult to speculate how well he would have done this season had he not been affected by the injury , but the 28-year-old Bruce was effective with a man up or a man short in the Sharks ' first season , and was expected to be a strong offensive leader this season as well . The injury appears serious , which is a shame , because otherwise he may have a much brighter future for now ; instead , his future with the Sharks next season appears clouded . # 18 MARK PEDERSON Season : 3rd Acquired : '92-93 , trade with Philadelphia for C/LW Dave Snuggerud Grade : I ( B ) It is difficult for me to understand the Flyers ' decision to unload Pederson , after a very good offensive season last season ( 40 points in 58 games ) , but after riding the pine early in the season , Pederson was summarily sent to the Sharks in exchange of the defensive-minded Snuggerud , and he finished with 41 games combined with the Flyers and the Sharks . He was also limited by injuries this season , and this limited his production ( 17 points ) . But when healthy , Pederson appears impressive , with a good scoring touch , good size ( and the willingness to throw it around , although he 's not considered a physical forward ) , and good speed . He also does not appear to be a liability on defense , but the Sharks probably have to wait until next season to see how much , exactly , Pederson can do . # 20 JOHN CARTER Season : 4th Acquired : '91-92 , free agent from Boston Grade : I ( B+/B ) Carter was definitely one of the hardest workers on the team , and the hard work worked wonders , as at times he looked great on ice . However , although he did look great at times , the fact that he received just 16 points ( in 55 games ) for his efforts is a sign that there is only so much his hard work can do , and the Sharks confirmed that by sending him to Kansas City with about 20 games left in the season . Carter , who will turn 30 on May 6 , always hussled , but as a result , was sometimes trapped too deep within the offensive zone while forechecking , but he was generally a credit on the defensive end , but he is probably of limited utility in that capacity , and he did not impress offensively , although he was one of the best Sharks at drawing penalties . He is very unlikely to be back next season . # 28 JEAN-FRANCOIS QUINTIN Season : 1st Acquired : '91-92 , from Minnesota in dispersal draft Grade : I ( B+/B ) I do n't understand why the Sharks did n't let Quintin play any more than the 14 games he played this season . He was generally hard-working and creating opportunities offensively , and appeared , at age 23 , ready for regular NHL duty , at least for a team like the Sharks , finishing with 7 points in those 14 games while not being a defensive liability . Shoulder injury in training camp before the '91-92 season limited Quintin , the team 's leading scorer in exhibition games despite sitting out the final two , to just 29 games with the Sharks and the Blades that season , but he looked impressive . He should be a solid contender for regular duty next season . # 41 MARK BEAUFAIT Season : 1st Acquired : 2nd round pick in 1991 supplemental draft Grade : I ( ? ) After a all-star season at Kansas City , Beaufait got a cup of coffey with the Sharks late in the season when the Blades knocked down a playoff spot and the Sharks decimated with injuries , playing 5 games and scoring a goal for his only NHL point thus far . Despite small size ( 5 ' 9 '' , 165 lbs . ) , Beaufait was not shy to throw himself around when necessary , and looked pretty good at times , although it 's too early to judge him based on 5 NHL games , in which he played mostly left wing , away from his center position at Northern Michigan and Kansas City . # 42 JAROSLAV OTEVREL Season : 1st Acquired : 8th round pick in 1991 entry draft Grade : I ( ? ) Like Beaufait , Otevrel also played away from his normal position when he was up for his cup of tea ( 7 games ) midway through the season . He was generally very much of a defensive liability , and did not show much offensively either , although that may be more indicative of the lack of ice time he got in those 7 games . He may need another season to work on his defense , but once his defense is acceptable , he should be ready . # 44 MICHEL PICARD Season : 1st Acquired : '92-93 , trade with Hartford for LW Yvon Corriveau Grade : I ( B-/C+ ) The 23-year-old Picard , although he perennially tore up the minors , seems to be close to being out of chances , for some reason , after being acquired by the Sharks but failing to impress the management in 25 games , scoring 4 goals for his only points , and he spent most of the rest of the way in Kansas City . He was not particularly strong defensively , and despite his offensive brilliance in the minors , he has failed thus far to score in the NHL , although he has been given limited opportunities . He may be the Sharks ' bait in the expansion draft . # 45 DODY WOOD Season : 1st Acquired : 3rd round pick in 1991 entry draft Grade : I ( D+/D , although perhaps I should n't give a grade at all ) I have been accused of knocking on Wood too much . : - ) Then , it is probably no surprise to you that I am thoroughly unimpressed by Wood thus far , although 13 games is a small example . He was generally a nonfactor on offense , was not particularly good defensively , and took too many silly penalties , losing many fights in the process and gathering 69 penalty minutes in those 13 games , projecting to to 446 ( ! ) in an 84-game season . He 's not ready , and needs at least another season at KC , where he can work on his fighting skills , if nothing else . His relatively small size ( 5 ' 11 '' , 181 lbs . ) does not give much possibility that he can survive , at this stage , as an enforcer . =============================================================================== GO CALGARY FLAMES !

I can tell you that mixing them between 'banks ' ok , and I ca n't see why mixing in one bank is not unless they are of different speeds ( e.g . mixing of 60ns and 100ns SIMMs in one bank ) . The two only differ in the type of chips it uses . Assuming that the SIMMS are 1Mx9 ( 9 bit wide ) , here is the two equivalent configuration . The 3-chip SIMM uses two 4-bit wide 4Mbit ( 1M of 4-bit nibbles ) and one 1-bit wide 1Mbit chip ( for a total of 9-bit wide 1Mbyte ) . The 9-bit SIMM uses nine 1-bit wide 1Mbit chips . These are equivalent because of the way that it is 'pinned ' on the SIMM board . At the SIMM interface , they both act as 9-bit wide 1MByte SIMMS ( 2*4+1=9*1 ) . [ sorry if too techie for ya ] .

If my system supports MG > > of 8 MEG ( it has 8 SIMM slots ) , can I plug in 4 4MB SIMMs to give my MG > > 16MB ? ? That sounds correct . the problem is that if your computer takes 9-bit wide SIMMs , you can not mix different sizes in one bank . Why you ask ? Simple , if you understand why there is banks . Assuming you have a 32-bit CPU ( 386DX or 486 ) , the data bus ( e.g . the mechanism to retrieve data from memory ) is 32-bits wide , so the computer expects to see 32 bits when it asks for data . To get that bandwidth ( 32-bit wide ) , the motherboard links 4 1Mx9 ( one bit is not data , but parity , so I will ignore that in this simple explaination ) to get 32bits [ ( 9-1 ) *4=32 bits ] . That means that a SIMM in a bank stores only 1/4 of the 32 bit wide data . If you have a 16-bit bus , two 1Mx9 SIMMs are linked together to get 16-bit wide data , which is the reason why 286 banks are 2 SIMMs wide , and 32-bit banks are 4 SIMMs wide . If your computer required 1Mx36 ( e.g . 32-bit wide data with 4 parity bits , used in some PS/2s and ASTs ) , you could upgrade by one SIMM at a time .

If you do n't have an XUSERFILESEARCHPATH environment variable then set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to be the directory where the BuilderXcessory file is . You can do this using the setenv command under csh . Note that the name ends in .ad so you will have to set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to { BX } / % N.ad to get the app-defaults to load correctly . To make sure the the app-defaults file can be read by all the users , make sure that a copy of or a link to the app-defaults file exists in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults or /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults , depending on how your system is set up . Once you have taken care of this set the *systemDirectory resource to be the directory in which you have installed BX . For example let 's say I 've installed BX in /t then my system directory resource should be set like this : *systemDirectory : /t/builderXcessory Thanks , ICS Tech Support

When the choice is > '' more feechurs '' or `` make the damn thing fast enough to keep up with the > flood '' , you have to bet that `` fast enough '' wins . Ed , as usual , makes a very good point . One time a friend of mine at Sun sent me an e-mail . He composed it using the Sun OpenWindows 3 `` mailtool '' which handles ( non-MIME ) `` attachments '' and the like . Since I do n't use `` mailtool '' , I had to manually save it , cut & paste , and then `` uudecode '' the actual attachment . What I got - after a not-inconsiderable amount of time spent doing this - was an audio file . The original message was over 32Kb of mail headers and uuencoded data ; the resulting audio message was a single sentence that I transcribed as a 135 character message . If he had sent me the sentence in plain text , the e-mail would have been around 250 bytes , and it would have taken me about 3 seconds to process it at most . Instead , it was 32k and it took at least a minute . A complete waste of ( my ) time and bandwidth , as far as I 'm concerned . Sending plain text is still the most efficient method of transmission , given the same transport mechanism . I shudder to think what would happen if everyone started posting their Usenet articles as audio files instead of plain text ! Meltdown of the Net predicted ! Film at Eleven ! Back to Mono !

Pick it up , hold it about a foot from your face and look closely at the saftey lever . If it has two positions , its an AR-15 , if it has three , its an M-16 . There are numerous internal differences as well , but since one would have to field strip the weapon to see them , they are not valid in this discussion . So , in conclusion , there is very little external differences to distinguish an AR-15 from an M-16 except at close ( very close ) range .

The Stars goals were scored by Mike McPhee and Ulf Dahlen , who netted two including the final one in franchise history , with less than a minute to play . Tonight , on the air on the Stars TV telecast , announcer Al Shaver , the voice of the North Stars , stated basically that he will not follow the team to Dallas . Shaver , when asked by his son ( who was doing the broadcast with him ) , '' What will you do now ? '' responded , `` First I 'm going to get me a new pair of slippers . Then I 'm going to sit in my easy chair and watch the world go by . '' Thank you North Stars , and thank you Al Shaver , for 26 years of Minnesota memories . Joel Alvstad

Anything which affects the physical world can be studied . For example , since we are part of the physical world , anything ( including spirits ) which affects our behaviour can be observed . Science does not make any claims about the existence or non-existence of objects which do not affect the physical world . > Since these asumptions about the nature of the world can not > themselves be made the subject of experiment , it is bad science > to believe them , as well as arrogance , illogic , and just plain > sloppy thinking . The purpose of science is to produce a model of the *physical* world . The model must be able to explain all past observations and predict the outcome of future observations . One of the aims of experiments is to carry out well defined observations which are objective . Ideally scientist will except the model which best describes the world , and the model which realises on the minimal number of assumptions . At the moment models which do not rely on the assumption of some *spiritual* world existing are equally powerful to ones which assume the assumption of a *spiritual* world . As the non-spiritual models has fewer assumptions it should be the currently accepted models . The scientific process never assumes that its present models are the correct ones , whereas many religions claim to represent the truth . The arrogance of many theists is that they claim to represent the truth , this can not be said of scientists .

You can generally tell the difference just by using it . If the cursor blinks a lot when there 's screen activity , it 's probably a software cursor . If it has a hardware cursor , I think you're probably battling a bug in HP 's X server . I 'm not familiar with any hardware cursor chips that display cursors greater than 64x64 . It 's quite possible that the server is just echoing your preferred cursor size without actually checking it . I vaguely recall that very old MIT server revisions did just that . In reality you 're probably stuck with a 64x64 maximum size cursor regardless of what the server returns . -joel

Nntp-Posting-Host : fcs280s.ncifcrf.gov Organization : Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center Lines : 53 Printer model and specification : Canon CLC 500 ( Color Laser Copier ) ps-ipu unit ( postscript intelligent processing unit ) Hello , We have recently purchased a very expensive and nice color copier/printer . We want to be able to print to it from our SGI iris network . The copier/printer has both a parallel and SCSI interface . I have configured the printer with the `` lp '' system using the parallel interface and can print postscript files to the printer . I can also print rgb files , but these are in turn converted to postscript by an internal filter . The Canon CLC 500 is a publication quality printer but the quality of our postscript printouts are less than acceptable . We create the postscript files with a variaty of programs , such as showcase , xv , and tops . When we convert to postscript with tops and use the -l option to specify the halftone screen density of 98 rather than the default 40 the output is better , but still much less that acceptable . Note , that we are starting with a screen image in rgb image format and translating the image into postscript . We suspect that if we could use the SCSI interface we would get higher quality pictures . We have not purchased the software that drives the printer from the SCSI port . To my knowledge this software is $ 5000 and does not come with a warranty . The management here does not want to spend this much money without some assurance that the product will work . Here my questions : If anybody on the net uses this printer are you using the SCSI or parallel port ? What is the quality of the printouts ? Is there a way to create high quality postscript printouts ? What is the limiting component , the postscript language or the postscript interpretor on the printer ? The Big question : Where can I get some software to drive the SCSI port for this printer ? Please email directly to me , I do n't not read news on a regular basis . I will post a summary .

Currently the most stable of anonymous remailing and posting sites is anon.penet.fi operated by julf @ penet.fi for several months , who has system adminstrator privileges and owns the equipment . Including anonymized mail , Usenet posting , and return addresses ( no encryption ) . Send mail to help @ penet.fi for information . Hal Finney has contributed an instruction manual for the cypherpunk remailers on the ftp site soda.berkeley.edu ( 128.32.149.19 ) : pub/cypherpunks/hal's.instructions . See also scripts.tar.Z ( UNIX scripts to aid remailer use ) and anonmail.arj ( MSDOS batch files to aid remailer use ) . ebrandt @ jarthur.claremont.edu -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Anonymized mail .

Request information from above address . phantom @ mead.u.washington.edu -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Experimental remailer with encryption to server . ` finger ' site address for information . Notes ===== - Cypherpunk remailers tend to be unstable because they are often running without site administrator knowledge . Liability issues are wholly unresolved . - So far , all encryption is based on public-key cryptography and PGP software ( see the question on cryptography ) . - Encryption aspects ( message text , destination address , replies ) vary between sites . - Multiple chaining , alias unlinking , and address encryption are mostly untested , problematic , or unsupported at this time . _____ < 8.2 > What are the responsibilities associated with anonymity ? Users -- -- - - Use anonymity only if you have to . Frivolous uses weaken the seriousness and usefulness of the capability for others . - Do not use anonymity to provoke , harass , or threaten others . - Do not hide behind anonymity to evade established conventions on Usenet , such as posting binary pictures to regular newsgroups . - If posting large files , be attentive to bandwidth considerations . Remember , simply sending the posting to the service increases network traffic . - Avoid posting anonymously to the regular hierarchy of Usenet ; this is the mostly likely place to alienate readers . The ` alt' hierarchy is preferred . - Give as much information as possible in the posting ( i.e . references , etc . ) Remember that content is the only means for readers to judge the truth of the message , and that any inaccuracies will tend to discredit the entire message and even future ones under the same handle . - Be careful not to include information that will reveal your identity or enable someone to deduce it . Test the system by sending anonymized mail to yourself . - Be aware of the policies of the anonymous site and respect them . Be prepared to forfeit your anonymity if you abuse the privilege . - Be considerate and respectful of other 's objections to anonymity . - `` Hit-and-run '' anonymity should be used with utmost reservation . Use services that provide anonymous return addresses instead . - Be courteous to the system operator , who may have invested large amounts of time , be personally risking his account , or dedicating his hardware , all for your convenience . Operators -- -- -- -- - - Document thoroughly acceptable and unacceptable uses in an introductory file that is sent to new users . Have a coherent and consistent policy and stick to it . State clearly what logging and monitoring is occurring . Describe your background , interest , and security measures . Will the general approach be totalitarian or lassaiz-faire ? - Formulate a plan for problematic ethical situations and anticipate potentially intense moral quandaries and dilemmas . What if a user is blackmailing someone through your service ? What if a user posts suicidal messages through your service ? Remember , your users trust you to protect them . - In the site introductory note , give clear examples of situations where you will take action and what these actions will be ( e.g . warn the user , limit anonymity to email or posting only , revoke the account , 'out ' the user , contact local administrator , etc . ) - Describe exactly the limitations of the software and hardware . Address the bandwidth limitations of your site . Report candidly and thoroughly all bugs that have occurred . Work closely with users to isolate and fix bugs . Address all bugs noted below under `` ( in ) stability of anonymity '' . - Document the stability of the site -- -how long has it been running ? What compromises have occured ? Why are you running it ? What is your commitment to it ? - Include a disclaimer in outgoing mail and messages . Include an address for complaints , ideally appended to every outgoing item . Consult a lawyer about your liability . - Be committed to the long-term stability of the site . Be prepared to deal with complaints and ` hate mail ' addressed to you . If you do not own the hardware the system runs on or are not the system adminstrator , consult those who do and are . - Be considerate of providing anonymity to various groups . If possible , query group readers . - Keep a uniformity and simplicity of style in outgoing message format that can be screened effectively by kill files . Ensure the key text ` Anon ' is somewhere in every header . - Take precautions to ensure the security of the server from physical and network-based attacks and infiltrations . Readers -- -- -- - - Do not complain , attack , or discredit a poster for the sole reason that he is posting anonymously , make blanket condemnations that equate anonymity with cowardice and criminality , or assail anonymous traffic in general for mostly neutral reasons ( e.g . its volume is heavy or increasing ) . - React to the anonymous information unemotionally . Abusive posters will be encouraged further if they get irrationally irate responses . Sometimes the most effective response is silence . - Notify operators if very severe abuses occur , such as piracy , harassment , extortion , etc . - Do not complain about postings being inappropriate because they offend you personally . - Use kill files to screen anonymous postings if you object to the idea of anonymity itself . - Avoid the temptation to proclaim that all anonymous postings should be barred from particular groups because no ` possible ' or ` conceivable ' need exists . References -- -- -- -- -- See e.g . ftp.eff.org : /pub/academic/anonymity : > This article is an excerpt from an issue of FIDONEWS on individual > privacy and the use of handles . It accepts the need of a system > operator to know the name of a user ; but suggests that the use of > a handle is analogous to a request to withhold the name in a > letter to the editor . The article concludes with a set of > guidelines for preserving the right to be anonymous . _____ < 8.3 > How do I ` kill ' anonymous postings ? James Thomas Green < jgreen @ zeus.calpoly.edu > : > Try putting this in your kill file : > > /Anon/h : j > /Anonymous/h : j > > This will search the headers of the messages and kill any that > contain ` Anon ' or ` Anonymous ' in them . Not perfect and won't > kill followups . Note that anonymous server operators have the capability to mask anonymous postings under which the above method will not work ; so far this practice is not widespread , but it may become more common as a countermeasure to widespread anonymous filtering . _____ < 8.4 > What is the history behind anonymous posting servers ? Originally anonymous posting services were introduced for individual , particularly volatile newsgroups , where anonymity is almost the preferred method of communication , such as talk.abortion and alt.sex.bondage . One of the first was one by Dave Mack started in ~1988 for alt.sex.bondage . Another early one was wizvax.methuen.ma.us run by Stephanie Gilgut ( Gilgut Enterprises ) but was disbanded due to lack of funds . The system provided anonymous return addresses . n7kbt.rain.com ( John Opalko ) took up the functions of this server , including reinstating the anonymous alias file . The group `` alt.personals has been chewing through servers like there 's no tomorrow . '' Spurred by the disappearance of ` wizvax ' and interested in researching the idea , Karl Kleinpaste < Karl_Kleinpaste @ godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu > developed his own system from scratch in six hours . By this time the idea of extending the server to new , more ` mainstream ' groups was starting to emerge , and he explored the possibility partly at the specific request by multiple users for anonymity in other groups . `` The intended advantage of my system was specifically to allow multiple group support , with a single anon identifier across all . This was arguably the single biggest deficiency of previous anon systems . '' K. Kleinpaste posted a message on rec.nude asking users whether an anonymous service would be welcome there , and judged a consensus against it . K. Kleinpaste introduced what he calls a `` fire extinguisher '' to ` squelch ' or ` plonk ' abusive users in response to complaints , and used this in three cases . Nevertheless , after a few months of intense traffic he was eventually overwhelmed by the abuses of his server . `` Even as restricted as it was , my system was subjected to abuses to the point where it was ordered dismantled by the facilities staff here . Such abuses started right after it was created . '' In ~Nov 1992 , Johan Helsingius ( julf @ penet.FI ) set up the most controversial anonymous site to date . anon.penet.fi is based on scripts and C code written by K. Kleinpaste and supports anonymized mail , posting , and return addresses . He initially wanted to confine the service to Scandinavian users but expanded it to worldwide accessability in response to 'lots ' of international requests . J. Helsingius policy of allowing anonymous posting to every Usenet newsgroup has been met with strong and serious ideological opposition ( e.g . by news adminstrators in news.admin.policy ) . Because of the relative newness and recent emergence of the medium , abuses by anonymous posters tend to have higher visibility than `` routine '' abuses . His total commitment to preservation of anonymity is also controversial . For example , in a highly controversial and publicized case in ~Feb 1993 , an anonymous user posted a supposed transcript of desperate crew dialogue during the Challenger shuttle disaster via anon.penet.fi to sci.astro . Despite that the transcript had been posted in the same place up to a year earlier ( then non-anonymously ) and actually originated not with the poster but a New York news tabloid , subsequent responses consisted largely of vociferous outrage at the poster 's use of anonymity , reverberating through many newsgroups . The original poster , using the same anonymous handle , later conceded that the story `` seemed likely to have been fabricated , '' suggesting the plausible possibility that the original intent was not to provoke outrage but gauge reactions on the authenticity of the story ( albeit crudely ) , free of personal risk from perceived association with the item . The ensuing commotion generated queries for the original article by late-entering readers . The anonymous user later posted deliberately offensive comments at his detractors . Despite piercingly irate and outraged complaints , and even the vocal opposition and verbal abuse of K. Kleinpaste and eminent news operators , J. Helsingius has largely avoided use of the `` fire extingisher '' and the `` group bouncer '' mechanisms that limit the scope of the service . As of ~March 1993 the anon.penet.fi site is best described as ` inundated ' : it has registered over 13,000 users in its initial three months of operation , forwards ~3000 messages a day , and approximately 5 % of all Usenet postings are anonymized through the site . The immense popularity is probably largely due to the capability for ` global ' anonymity which has allowed users to find creative uses in diverse areas not previously envisioned . Johan Helsingius has been subject to extraordinary pressure to dismantle his server in ~Feb 1993 . At one point K. Kleinpaste threatened publicly to organize a sort of vigilante group of irate news operators to send out revocation commands on all messages originating from the site . J. Helsingius has also alluded to threats of flooding the server . The server has crashed several times , at least once due to a saturation ` mailbombing ' through it by an anonymous user . Mr. Helsingius reports spending up to 5 hours per day answering email requests alone associated with the service 's administration . In response to the serious threats he disabled global group access temporarily for one week and encouraged his users to defend the service publicly . Based on fast-moving dialogue and creative suggestions by `` cypherpunks , '' J. Helsingius has identified many security weaknesses and valuable new features for the service , and is currently in the process of code development and testing . He is planning on upgrading the IBM compatible 386 machine to a 486 soon to handle the voluminous load and is considering integrating a new system with very sophisticated functionality , including multiple email aliases , alias allocation control , public-key encryption , etc . A very sophisticated anonymous posting system was set up in Dec. 1992 by D. Clunie < dclunie @ pax.tpa.com.au > that used cryptography in both directions ( to/from ) the server for the highest degree of confidentiality seen so far . However , it was running on a public access account , and he had to shut it down after only several weeks , upon receiving requests and conditions apparently ultimately originating from NSF representatives . D. Clunie has released the software to the public domain . Recently the idea of a newsgroup devoted to ` whistleblowing ' on government abuses has received wide and focused attention , and group formation is currently underway . In the basic scenario the group would allow people to post pseudonymously using remailers , and even establish reputations based on their authentifiable digital signatures . The traffic may eventually reach reporters in the mainstream news media . deltorto @ aol.com has volunteered to attack multiple aspects of this project , including distributing easy-to-read documentation on posting , anonymization , and encryption .

I am not in favor of paganism . I am not in favor of the Easter Bunny or other non-Christian aspects of Easter as presently celebrated . ( Incidentally , Easter eggs are not non-Christian ; they are a way of ending the Lenten fast . ) My point was to distinguish between ( 1 ) intentionally worshipping a pagan deity , and ( 2 ) doing something which may once have had pagan associations , but nowadays is not understood or intended as such . Many people who are doing ( 2 ) are being accused of ( 1 ) . It would be illogical to claim that one is `` really '' worshipping a pagan deity without knowing it . Worship is a matter of intention .

Well , I 'm not sure I 'd use this to process a guitar but there was a audio filter DSP construction article in the Sept 92 issue of QST magazine ( Ham Radio oriented ) . The DSP is available in kit form for about $ 120 . This particular DSP filter was targetted toward processing audio to remove noise ( static ) . I built it and it really works well . The source code is available too . It makes a noisy audio signal much easier to hear .

At first , the news media seemed entranced by all the new gizmos the military was using , not to mention the taped video transmissions from the missiles as they zeroed in on their targets . But later , and especially after the bunker full of civilians was hit , they changed their tone . It seemed to me that they did n't have the stomach for the reality of war , that innocent people really do die and are maimed in warfare . It 's like they were only pro-Gulf-War as long as it was `` nice and clean '' ( smart missiles dropping in on military HQs ) , but not when pictures of dead , dying , and maimed civilians started cropping up .

I have often wondered about this . I 've always thought that the first bomb should have been dropped on Japan 's island fortress of Truk . A good , inpenatrable military target . The second bomb could 've been held back for use on an industrial center if need be . But I digress . Yes , I have heard that we found evidence ( after the war , BTW ) that Japan was seriously considering surrender after the first bomb . Unfortunately , the military junta won out over the moderates and rejected the US's ulimatum . Therefore the second bomb was dropped . Most unfortunate , IMO . > > > I , for one , do n't regret it . > > Nuke a Jap for Jesus ! > I do n't regret the fact that sometimes military decisions have to be made which affect the lives of innocent people .

Actually , it was the fact that both situations existed that prompted US and allied action . If some back-water country took over some other back-water country , we probably would n't intervene . Not that we don't care , but we ca n't be the world 's policman . Or if a coup had occured in Kuwait ( instead of an invasion ) , then we still would n't have acted because there would not have been the imminent danger perceived to Saudi Arabia . But the combination of the two , an unprovoked invasion by a genocidal tyrant AND the potential danger to the West 's oil interests , caused us to take action . > > [ I 've moved a paragraph from here to later on ] > [ ... ] > > > > If we had n't intervened , allowing Hussein to keep Kuwait , then it would > > have been appeasement . > > Right .

Hardly . I did n't say that it 's a Good Thing [ tm ] to kill innocent people if the end is just . Unfortunately , we do n't live in a perfect world and there are no perfect solutions . If one is going to resist tyranny , then innocent people on both sides are going to suffer and die . I did n't say it is OK -- it is unfortunate , but sometimes necessary . > > I , a moral relativist , am arguing that saturation bombing of German cities at > the end of World War II was ( as far as I can see ) an evil and unnecessary act . I would agree that it was evil in the sense that it caused much pain and suffering . I 'm not so sure that it was unnecessary as you say . That conclusion can only be arrived at by evaluating all the factors involved . And perhaps it *was* unnecessary as ( let 's say ) we now know . That doesn't mean that those who had to make the decision to bomb did n't see it as being necessary . Rarely can one have full known of the consequences of an action before making a decision . At the time it may have seemed necessary enough to go ahead with it . But do n't assume that I feel the bombing was *morally* justified -- I do n't ! I just do n't condemn those who had to make a difficult decision under difficult circumstances . > > You , having criticised moral relativism in the past , are now arguing that I am > in no position to judge the morality of allied actions at the end of the > War . You certainly are not in such a position if you are a moral relativist . I , as an absolutist , am in a position to judge , but I defer judgment . > You are arguing that the actions need to be assessed in the particular > context of the time , and that they might have been moral then but not moral > now . Wrong . They were neither moral then nor now . They seemed necessary to those making the decisions to bring a quick end to the war . I simply refuse to condemn them for their decision . > > Where 's your Christian love ? Where 's your absolute morality ? Oh , how quick > you are to discard them when it suits you . As Ivan Stang would say , `` Jesus > would puke ! '' One day I will stand before Jesus and give account of every word and action ; even this discourse in this forum . I understand the full ramifications of that , and I am prepared to do so . I do n't believe that you can make the same claim . > > mathew And BTW , the reason I brought up the blanket-bombing in Germany was because you were bemoaning the Iraqi civilian casualties as being '' so deplorable '' . Yet blanket bombing was instituted because bombing was n't accurate enough to hit industrial/military targets in a decisive way by any other method at that time . But in the Gulf War , precision bombing was the norm . So the point was , why make a big stink about the relatively few civilian casualties that resulted *in spite of* precision bombing , when so many more civilians ( proportionately and quantitatively ) died under the blanket bombing in WW2 ? Even with precision bombing , mistakes happen and some civilians suffer . But less civilians suffered in this war than any other iany other in history ! Many Iraqi civilians went about their lives with minimal interference from the allied air raids . The stories of `` hundreds of thousands '' of Iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk . Yes , bunk . The US lost 230,000 servicemen in WW2 over four years and the majority of them were directly involved in fighting ! But we are expected to swallow that `` hundreds of thousands '' of *civilian* Iraqis died in a war lasting about 2 months ! And with the Allies using the most precise bombs ever created at that ! What hogwash . If `` hundreds of thousands '' of Iraqi civilians died , it was due to actions Hussein took on his own people , not due to the Allied bombing . Regards , Jim B .

If a 'dog 's prayers were answered , bones would rain from the sky . Did you know that the word 'Karabag ' itself is a 'Turkish ' name ? Before 1827 , before the Russians and their 'zavalli kole ' Armenians , drove all the Turks/Muslims out , it was a Turkish majority town . Well , anyway , it is not surprising that Armenians also collaborated with the Nazis . `` Wholly opportunistic the Dashnaktzoutun have been variously pro-Nazi , pro-Russia , pro-Soviet Armenia , pro-Arab , pro-Jewish , as well as anti-Jewish , anti-Zionist , anti-Communist , and anti-Soviet - whichever was expedient . `` [ 1 ] [ 1 ] John Roy Carlson ( Arthur Derounian ) , 'Cairo to Damascus , ' Alfred A. Knopf , New York , 1951 , p. 438 . As a dear friend put it , the Tzeghagrons ( Armenian Racial Patriots ) was the youth organization of the Dashnaktzoutun . It was based in Boston ( where ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism Triangle is located ) but had followers in Armenian colonies all over the world . Literally Tzeghagron means 'to make a religion of one 's race . ' The architect of the Armenian Racial Patriots was Garegin Nezhdeh , a Nazi Armenian who became a key leader of collaboration with Hitler in World War II . In 1933 , he had been invited to the United States by the Central Committee of the Dashnaktzoutun to inspire and organize the American-Armenian youth . Nezhdeh succeeded in unifying many local Armenian youth groups in the Tzeghagrons . Starting with 20 chapters in the initial year , the Tzeghagrons grew to 60 chapters and became the largest and most powerful Nazi Armenian organization . Nezhdeh also provided the Tzeghagrons with a philosophy : `` The Racial Religious beliefs in his racial blood as a deity . Race above everything and before everything . Race comes first . `` [ 1 ] [ 1 ] Quoted in John Roy Carlson ( real name Arthur Derounian ) , `` The Armenian Displaced Persons , '' in 'Armenian Affairs , ' Winter , 1949-50 , p. 19 , footnote . Now wait , there is more . THE GRUESOME extent of February 's killings of Azeris by Armenians in the town of Hojali is at last emerging in Azerbaijan - about 600 men , women and children dead in the worst outrage of the four-year war over Nagorny Karabakh . The figure is drawn from Azeri investigators , Hojali officials and casualty lists published in the Baku press . Diplomats and aid workers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates . The 25 February attack on Hojali by Armenian forces was one of the last moves in their four-year campaign to take full control of Nagorny Karabakh , the subject of a new round of negotiations in Rome on Monday . The bloodshed was something between a fighting retreat and a massacre , but investigators say that most of the dead were civilians . The awful number of people killed was first suppressed by the fearful former Communist government in Baku . Later it was blurred by Armenian denials and grief-stricken Azerbaijan 's wild and contradictory allegations of up to 2,000 dead . The State Prosecuter , Aydin Rasulov , the cheif investigator of a 15-man team looking into what Azerbaijan calls the `` Hojali Disaster '' , said his figure of 600 people dead was a minimum on preliminary findings . A similar estimate was given by Elman Memmedov , the mayor of Hojali . An even higher one was printed in the Baku newspaper Ordu in May - 479 dead people named and more than 200 bodies reported unidentified . This figure of nearly 700 dead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova , the new spokeswoman of the Azeri Ministry of Defence . FranCois Zen Ruffinen , head of delegation of the International Red Cross in Baku , said the Muslim imam of the nearby city of Agdam had reported a figure of 580 bodies received at his mosque from Hojali , most of them civilians . `` We did not count the bodies . But the figure seems reasonable . It is no fantasy , '' Mr Zen Ruffinen said . `` We have some idea since we gave the body bags and products to wash the dead . '' Mr Rasulov endeavours to give an unemotional estimate of the number of dead in the massacre . `` Do n't get worked up . It will take several months to get a final figure , '' the 43-year-old lawyer said at his small office . Mr Rasulov knows about these things . It took him two years to reach a firm conclusion that 131 people were killed and 714 wounded when Soviet troops and tanks crushed a nationalist uprising in Baku in January 1990 . Those nationalists , the Popular Front , finally came to power three weeks ago and are applying pressure to find out exactly what happened when Hojali , an Azeri town which lies about 70 miles from the border with Armenia , fell to the Armenians . Officially , 184 people have so far been certified as dead , being the number of people that could be medically examined by the republic 's forensic department . `` This is just a small percentage of the dead , '' said Rafiq Youssifov , the republic 's chief forensic scientist . `` They were the only bodies brought to us . Remember the chaos and the fact that we are Muslims and have to wash and bury our dead within 24 hours . '' Of these 184 people , 51 were women , and 13 were children under 14 years old . Gunshots killed 151 people , shrapnel killed 20 and axes or blunt instruments killed 10 . Exposure in the highland snows killed the last three . Thirty-three people showed signs of deliberate mutilation , including ears , noses , breasts or penises cut off and eyes gouged out , according to Professor Youssifov's report . Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those believed to have been killed , Mr Rasulov said . Files from Mr Rasulov 's investigative commission are still disorganised - lists of 44 Azeri militiamen are dead here , six policemen there , and in handwriting of a mosque attendant , the names of 111 corpses brought to be washed in just one day . The most heartbreaking account from 850 witnesses interviewed so far comes from Towfiq Manafov , an Azeri investigator who took a helicopter flight over the escape route from Hojali on 27 February . `` There were too many bodies of dead and wounded on the ground to count properly : 470-500 in Hojali , 650-700 people by the stream and the road and 85-100 visible around Nakhchivanik village , '' Mr Manafov wrote in a statement countersigned by the helicopter pilot . `` People waved up to us for help . We saw three dead children and one two-year-old alive by one dead woman . The live one was pulling at her arm for the mother to get up . We tried to land but Armenians started a barrage against our helicopter and we had to return . '' There has been no consolidation of the lists and figures in circulation because of the political upheavals of the last few months and the fact that nobody knows exactly who was in Hojali at the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villages taken over by Armenian forces .

I 'm new to motorcycles so no flames please . I don't > have my bike yet so I need a few pieces of information : > > [ ... ] Any stories on how you all learned ? I 'll tell you my story as an example of what *not* to do . Early in 1984 I took some riding lessons from my college roommate on his old Honda CB360T . He had taken the MSF beginner 's course , so I actually learned *some* of what I needed to know to ride . I proceeded to buy a beat-up Honda CL350 for $ 400 and a $ 12 helmet and rode around wearing this and a cotton windbreaker . Then I decided to invest in a full-face helmet ( first smart move ) . Sometime around then I also passed my road test . On May 4 , 1984 , I got caught in a rainstorm on my way home from a 4-mile trip . Entering the town where I lived ( a rather urban suburb ) , I had to stop suddenly for a red light that I noticed too late , skidded the rear tire out , and was ejected face upward into the oncoming lane of traffic . Fortunately for me the oncoming traffic was also stopped for the same red light , otherwise I might have slid under a car and been killed . Now this is anecdotal evidence , to be sure , but I later took the Experienced Rider Course from the MSF and saw that earlier training could have helped me greatly . In your case the need is even greater since you have nobody to help you practice even the most basic stuff as I did . So my advice is to take the MSF beginner 's course first thing . I would n't even buy a bike until you 've taken the course , unless you happen to pick up a real good deal and can store it someplace until you 're ready to use it . > 1 ) I only have about $ 1200-1300 to work with , so that would have > to cover everything ( bike , helmet , anything else that I 'm too > ignorant to know I need to buy ) While you 're waiting to take the course ( it might take a few weeks in DC , as I recall there were always waiting lists in Boston ) , could you save up some more money to start out right ? Say $ 300 for riding gear , plus the cost bike , plus maybe $ 100 ( guess ) to a mechanic to make sure the machine is safe ( assuming you economize by buying some old beat-up machine from a private individual ) , plus insurance , plus registration and licensing fees , plus the course , you 're looking at maybe $ 600 not including the bike itself and a reserve for ongoing maintenance . > 2 ) What is buying a bike going to do to my insurance ? I turn 18 in > about a month so my parents have been taking care of my insurance up > till now , and I need a comprehensive list of costs that buying a > motorcycle is going to insure ( I live in Washington DC if that makes > a difference ) I pay about $ 100 insurance now ( upstate NY ) but it was closer to $ 200 in Boston ( more urban ) for decent insurance including substantial coverage for liability , which you want unless you plan always to be poor . I 'd guess DC is more like Boston than like a rural area , ergo more expensive . > 3 ) Any recommendations on what I should buy/where I should look for it ? There used to be annual buyer 's guides in the usual motorcycle magazines ; I found those helpful in getting an idea of what new or recent models might be available . You could probably look through past issues to size up what used bikes might be available . ( My first bike was 13 years old when I bought it so I went on my friend 's advice instead . ) Also look at the bikes that you see people riding or that are parked on the street . I basically settled on my present bike by noticing that there were a lot of high-mileage BMW 's running around and they were generally set up the way I wanted . Nothing wrong with talking to various dealers in your area or visiting showrooms . Dealers in the Boston area , at least when I was shopping , were very nice about letting you look around their showrooms and quoting prices for bikes that were n't the latest models ( hence cheaper ) , although I ended up buying both bikes in private sales . -- David Karr ( karr @ cs.cornell.edu ) -- '80 BMW R65 DoD # 0969 also BMWMOA , NRA , ACLU , et al .

From : kilroy @ gboro.rowan.edu ( Dr Nancy 's Sweetie ) Subject : Re : Freemasonry and the Southern Baptist Convention Summary : Update on events . Keywords : update , report , ` Woof ! ' Organization : Rowan College of New Jersey Disclaimer : Sometime tonight , Brandy the WonderDog will turn 11 years old . You can e-mail your presents ( he likes rawhide chewy toys ) to the address above . Lines : 73 There were some recent developments in the dispute about Masonry among Southern Baptists . I posted a summary over in bit.listserv.christia , and I suppose that it might be useful here . Note that I do not necessarily agree or disagree with any of what follows : I present it as information . * For a short summary : a Southern Baptist named Larry Holly wrote a book claiming that Freemasonry is a religion incompatible with Christianity . ( Mr Holly 's father rejects Christianity , and Mr Holly blames that on the Masons . ) The SBC 's Home Missions Board includes an interfaith witness department , which studies other religions and how to teach them about Christ . A few years ago , they were ordered to produce a report on Masonry : they concluded that it was not a religion , and therefore was outside their speciality . However , Mr Holly led a movement of people who oppose Masonry , and last year the Convention again ordered the HMB to study Masonry . ( I got the feeling that they were saying `` You got the wrong answer last time , try to do better and get the answer we want . '' ) Anyway , there 's been a bit of infighting and some inappropriate actions , but the dust has settled and the report is in . Nobody is entirely happy with it , but everybody seems willing to live with it . Both sides are saying things such as : `` This was the best we were going to get in the current environment . '' The report commends the Masons for the charity work they do , such as the hospitals and burn centers they operate , as well as efforts to help the elderly and prevent drug abuse . The report acknowledges that many well- known Christians are and have been Masons , and notes that many teachings of Masonry are `` supportive of Christian faith and practice '' . Examples of the latter include belief in God , emphases on honesty and integrity , and that some Masonic lodges incorporate explicit Christian beliefs . On the other hand , they note that some aspects of Masonry are incompatible with Southern Baptist principles . These included the use of titles which some people consider sacrilegious , the taking of certain oaths ( even though they are not meant seriously ) , the `` undeniably pagan and/or occultic '' writings of some Masonic leaders , the implication in some Masonic writings that salvation can be achieved by good works , and the racial discrimination practiced by many Masonic lodges . ( I note with some chagrin that Baptist churches as a whole are n't really in a place to speak on this last point . ) The report concludes that Masonry is not a religion , and says that membership should not be endorsed or censured , but left to the discretion of individuals . This was in part because there is variation among different Masonic Lodges , and while one may include elements strongly against Christianity , another may not . Many Southern Baptists have strong convictions about the priesthood of the believer and the autonomy of the local church , and this history probably influenced how the report came out . * The information above was gleaned from `` The Religious Herald '' , a publication of the Baptist General Association of Virginia , and `` Baptists Today '' , which does not have any direct links to a religious organisation . ( Autonomy is a big issue among some Baptists . 8- ) Because I have neither the report itself , nor whatever Masonic documents are relevant to these issues , none of the above comes with a guarantee . Your mileage may vary . Void where prohibited .

Lines : 55 Nntp-Posting-Host : sunspot.ece.clarkson.edu It might pay to start looking at what this proposal might mean to a police agency . It just might be a bad idea for them , too . OK , suppose the NY State Police want to tap a suspect 's phone . They need a warrant , just like the old days . But unlike the old days , they now need to ( a ) get two federal agencies to give them the two parts of the key . Now , what happens if there 's a tiff between the two escrow houses ? Posession/release of keys becomes a political bargaining chit . State and lower-level police agencies have to watch the big boys play politics , while potentially good leads disappear , lives and property are lost , statutes of limitations run out , etc . Not to mention : a moderately clever person who suspects the police are after her/him will be buying new phones faster than tap requests can be processed . Or using stolen ones . [ Will the Turing Police come and arrest you for transmitting without a dialing license ? ] There 's also bureacracy and security problems -- within each escrow house , how will requests for key disclosure be authenticated ? Put in enough safeguards of the kind bureaucrats and activists feel comfortable with , and it might take a LONG time to get that key . [ Even when a request is approved , how is the key going to be disclosed ? Will it be encrypted by a Clipper-type chip for transmission ? In a bureaucracy the size of the Federal Government , with a databank of the necessary size , and data traffic of the projected volume , there 's going to be a lot of weak links . How many of these kinds of problems will be open for public or `` expert '' scrutiny ? ] Furthermore , the Feds might be leery of handing completed keys around , even to State Police agencies : a trust and security issue . This would be an especially acute issue if some other State 's Police had mishandled a key , resulting in lawsuits , financial settlements , and political embarassment . So , the Feds implement it this way : ( b ) some federal agency gets the keys , performs the tap , and turns the results over to the NY State Police . But let 's say Cuomo 's been causing some problems over a Clinton Aid-To-Urban-Areas proposal . Or there just happens to be a turf war going on between the State cops and the Justice department on a case . Now , not only do we have the keys as a political chit , we have an extra player in the game *and* we have the tap 's tapes as another bargaining chit . Again , the State Police lose . I understand that ( legal ) wiretaps are quite expensive to maintain .

I was opposed to intervention in Somalia for the same reason I am opposed to intervention in Bosnia - there is no security interest of the United States there which justifies risking the lives of American servicemen , and there are too many crises in the world for us to take on all of them . In the case of Bosnia , the risks are obviously much greater , and there are other countries in a much better position and with far better reasons to take action than the US . > The whole point is that Somalia _is_ a third world country , and we were more > willing to send troops there than to Bosnia -- exactly the _opposite_ of what > the `` fixation on European countries '' theory would predict . ( Similarly , the > desire to help Muslims being fought by Christians is also exactly the opposite > of what that theory predicts . ) You continue to misunderstand . I did not say the reason why people want to intervene is because of racist ( < - you seem to be overly fond of using this word , btw . I said the phenomenon was race-related , which is not the same as racist . Perhaps this distinction is too subtle for you to grasp ) motives - I said the attention and outrage at the entire Yugoslavian situation was a result of it being 1 ) closer to home , 2 ) happening to people we can identify with , and 3 ) relentlessly harped on by the media . I never said anything about which side would be preferred , which has a lot more to do with the presentation of the conflict than any psychological factors . I think there is no doubt that despite the fact we intervened in Somalia , the level of attention devoted to there was considerably less than what is devoted to Bosnia , if the newspapers and tv news I see are any guide .

From : mathew < mathew @ mantis.co.uk > Subject : Alt.Atheism FAQ : Overview for New Readers Summary : Hi . Please read this before you post . Keywords : FAQ , atheism Expires : Thu , 20 May 1993 10:52:53 GMT Distribution : world Organization : Mantis Consultants , Cambridge . UK . Supersedes : < 19930413094109 @ mantis.co.uk > Lines : 145 Archive-name : atheism/overview Alt-atheism-archive-name : overview Last-modified : 5 April 1993 Version : 1.2 Overview Welcome to alt.atheism and alt.atheism.moderated . This is the first in a series of regular postings aimed at new readers of the newsgroups . Many groups of a 'controversial ' nature have noticed that new readers often come up with the same questions , mis-statements or misconceptions and post them to the net . In addition , people often request information which has been posted time and time again . In order to try and cut down on this , the alt.atheism groups have a series of five regular postings under the following titles : 1 . Alt.Atheism FAQ : Overview for New Readers 2 . Alt.Atheism FAQ : Introduction to Atheism 3 . Alt.Atheism FAQ : Frequently Asked Questions ( FAQ ) 4 . Alt.Atheism FAQ : Constructing a Logical Argument 5 . Alt.Atheism FAQ : Atheist Resources This is article number 1 . Please read numbers 2 and 3 before posting . The others are entirely optional . If you are new to Usenet , you may also find it helpful to read the newsgroup news.announce.newusers . The articles titled `` A Primer on How to Work With the Usenet Community '' , `` Answers to Frequently Asked Questions about Usenet '' and `` Hints on writing style for Usenet '' are particularly relevant . Questions concerning how news works are best asked in news.newusers.questions . If you are unable to find any of the articles listed above , see the `` Finding Stuff '' section below . Credits These files could not have been written without the assistance of the many readers of alt.atheism and alt.atheism.moderated . In particular , I 'd like to thank the following people : kck+ @ cs.cmu.edu ( Karl Kluge ) perry @ dsinc.com ( Jim Perry ) NETOPRWA @ ncsuvm.cc.ncsu.edu ( Wayne Aiken ) chpetk @ gdr.bath.ac.uk ( Toby Kelsey ) jkp @ cs.HUT.FI ( Jyrki Kuoppala ) geoff.arnold @ East.Sun.COM ( Geoff Arnold ) torkel @ sics.se ( Torkel Franzen ) kmldorf @ utdallas.edu ( George Kimeldorf ) roe2 @ quads.uchicago.edu ( Greg Roelofs ) arromdee @ jyusenkyou.cs.jhu.edu ( Ken Arromdee ) madhaus @ netcom.com ( Maddi Hausmann ) J5J @ psuvm.psu.edu ( John A.

These articles are free . Truly free . You may copy them and distribute them to anyone you wish . However , please send any changes or corrections to the author , and please do not re-post copies of the articles to alt.atheism ; it does nobody any good to have multiple versions of the same document floating around the network . Finding Stuff All of the FAQ files *should* be somewhere on your news system . Here are some suggestions on what to do if you ca n't find them : 1 . Check the newsgroup alt.atheism . Look for subject lines starting with `` Alt.Atheism FAQ : '' . 2 . Check the newsgroup news.answers for the same subject lines . If you do n't find anything in steps 1 or 2 , your news system is n't set up correctly , and you may wish to tell your system administrator about the problem . 3 . If you have anonymous FTP access , connect to rtfm.mit.edu [ 18.172.1.27 ] . Go to the directory /pub/usenet/alt.atheism , and you 'll find the latest versions of the FAQ files there . FTP is a a way of copying files between networked computers . If you need help in using or getting started with FTP , send e-mail to mail-server @ rtfm.mit.edu with send usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in the body . 4 . There are other sites which also carry news.answers postings . The article `` Introduction to the news.answers newsgroup '' carries a list of these sites ; the article is posted regularly to news.answers . 5 . If you do n't have FTP , send mail to mail-server @ rtfm.mit.edu consisting of the following lines : send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources send usenet/alt.atheism/faq send usenet/alt.atheism/introduction send usenet/alt.atheism/logic send usenet/alt.atheism/resources 5 . ( Penultimate resort ) Send mail to mail-server @ mantis.co.uk consisting of the following lines : send atheism/faq/faq.txt send atheism/faq/logic.txt send atheism/faq/intro.txt send atheism/faq/resource.txt and our poor overworked modems will try and send you a copy of the files . There 's other stuff , too ; interesting commands to try are `` help '' and `` send atheism/index '' . 6 . ( Last resort ) Mail mathew @ mantis.co.uk , or post an article to the newsgroup asking how you can get the FAQ files . You should only do this if you 've tried the above methods and they 've failed ; it 's not nice to clutter the newsgroup or people 's mailboxes with requests for files . it 's better than posting without reading the FAQ , though ! For instance , people whose email addresses get mangled in transit and who do n't have FTP will probably need assistance obtaining the FAQ files . mathew ÿ

The University of Washington ( plus 3 or 4 others [ Harvard , UNC ] ) has a department and advanced degree program in Biostatistics . My wife has an MS Biostat , and there are plenty of MDs , PhDs , and postdocs doing Biostatistical work . People do this for a living . Really bright people study for decades to do this sort of study well . Anecedotal evidence is worthless . Even doctors who have been using a drug or treatment for years , and who swear it is effective , are often suprised at the results of clinical trials . Whether or not MSG causes describable , reportable , documentable symptoms should be pretty simple to discover . The last study on which my wife worked employed 200 nurses , 100 doctors , and a dozen Ph.Ds at one University and at 70 hospitals in five nations . I would think the MSG question could be settled by one lowly Biostat MS student in a thesis . -- bruce

I 'd driven it since the previous July , putting 20k miles on it . The sensor light used to light up regularly , starting about 5k miles after I bought it . My brother and I rebuilt the engine but used all of the original equipment , so I suppose the sensor could have used replacement . Performance ( hah , if you could call it that ) did not change .

For a stat-head , I 'm amazed that you put any credence in spring training . Did you notice who he got those 10 ( ! ) hits off of , or are you going to tell me that it does n't make a difference ? > > The kid *will* improve playing at AAA , > > Just like Keith Mitchell did ? Wait a minute . I missed something here . First , forget Keith Mitchell . Are you saying that a kid who moves from AA to AAA and then does not improve would have been better off making a direct leap to the majors ? If a player does well at AA and then does not improve at AAA , is n't that a sign that maybe he doesn't belong in the bigs ? Now , Keith Mitchell . As I recall ( no stat books handy - surprise ! ) he jumped from AA to Atlanta in 1991 . He did so well that he was returned to the minors , where he did n't do very well at all . Now his career is in jeopardy . So how does he fit in with your point . Good MLE 's in AA . Moved him right to the big club . Now he 's one step away from being traded or moved out of baseball .

From : shiva @ leland.Stanford.EDU ( Matt Jacobson ) Subject : Windows Errors and a bad memory Organization : DSG , Stanford University , CA 94305 , USA Lines : 18 Hi . My last question for the year . I have a mail-order no-name notebook with 4 meg ram . I never have problems with my huge ramdisk or when running desqview , but Win3.1 and W4W2.0 constantly crash on me , most commonly citing a `` memory parity error . '' The only thing I can do is TURN OFF and re-boot . My CMOS ticks off & counts all the memory every startup , and there is never a problem with this either . Could it be a bug in my Windows copy instead of the hardware ? I remember having some disk error problems when installing it . Is there any change I could make to lessen the frequency or likelyhood of this happening ( I think win vs win /s produce different crashes , but both crash frequently nonetheless ) I know this is a pain , but PLEASE answer by EMAIL because my home account does n't have rn . And I will stop asking questions now . Thank you . Chet Pager = chetter @ ucthpx.uct.ac.za

Article-I.D . : shelley.1qsce9INNgd0 Distribution : world Organization : University of Washington , Seattle Lines : 37 NNTP-Posting-Host : stein.u.washington.edu Hi there , I 'm having a bizarre video problem within Windows 3.1 . I have a 286 with a GVGA-16 video board . I 've been using the standard Windows VGA driver with other similarly configured computers . I am thinking that my problem is with the way Windows refreshes it 's screen . The problem is that once Windows has been envoked , the colors start changing themselves . At first I thought it was hardware , but if you open a full screen DOS program from within the Windows session , you do n't have any problems until you get back to Windows - however , when you initially return to Windows , the original colors get refreshed properly . Also , it is not a uniform color change - so if you are in solitaire , the design on the back of the card maintains it 's original color scheme , but the white fronts of the cards will turn grey , then blue , etc . The color changes keep getting darker until finally everything is a dark purple-ish black . If you pop out to DOS and exit back to Windows - the screen gets refreshed again . If I do n't log into Windows and just do DOS things from the Novell network , everything is fine . I originally loaded the software by bouncing it down to the net from the other machine I had just finished configuring , then from the net to this machine . When I ran into problems , I deleted everything on this machine and the net , and tried bouncing it again . When that did n't work , I tried reloading Windows to no avail . Any thoughts on things to check out ? I am totally baffled ! Thanks in advance for any assistance and instruction ! Linda Cornell lcornell @ u.washington.edu UW Office of Research

I also know that there is a movement called something like 'Jesus alone . ' I believe in the Trinity and have no plans to change that , but reently I was made aware that there is at least one person within our church who holds the view that there is no trinity . In the near future we will discuss this item , and I feel that I shall ask you , my friends on this group , for background information . Can anybody tell me the basic reasons for holding a belief that there is only Jesus ? And vice versa : The foundations for the Trinity ? I shall appreciate both quotes from the Bible and historical development . Thank you all .

From : silly @ ugcs.caltech.edu ( Brad Threatt ) Subject : Remote file system security Organization : California Institute of Technology , Pasadena Lines : 20 NNTP-Posting-Host : vex.ugcs.caltech.edu In light of my recent paranoia concerning government proposals , I 'd love to see a UNIX-based encryption scheme that : 1 ) Kept some files encrypted on the host machine ( say , all the files in your home directory ) 2 ) Used a key system that could not be compromised by eavesdropping over a modem line . It seems that this would require modifications to a shell program and a way of telling whether a file was encrypted or not , among other things . I 'd love to know about potential security holes in such a system . Does such a system exist ? If it were made easy-to-use and readily available , I think it would be a Good Thing ( tm ) . I realize that this would probably just involve putting a nice front-end on a readily available and very secure encryption scheme , but it should be done . Thanks for the ear , Brad

A piece of advice for you : do n't be abrupt with the throttle . No wheelies , accelerate a wee bit more slowly than usual . Consciously worry about spitting her off the back . It 's as much your job to keep her on the pillion as it is hers , and I guarantee she 'll be put off by the bike ripping out from under her when you whack it open . Keep the lean angles pretty tame the first time out too . You and her need to learn each other 's body English . She needs to learn what your idea is about how to take the turn , and you need to learn her idea of `` shit ! Do n't crash now ! '' so you do n't work at cross purposes while leaned over . You can work up to more aggressive riding over time . A very important thing : tell her to put her hand against the tank when you brake -- this could save you some severely crushed cookies .

The Ack man is apparently an alien life-form , much like the pod people from planet Mars , who can take on any form ( the ability remains the same , however ) . The Ack-people have been spotted on many teams to date , but it appears that the Orioles staff ( mentioned above ) and the Expos bullpen ( Barnes , Walton , Fassero , Gardiner and Rojas ) have been the prime target . Apparently John Wetteland was roughed up by the Ack-people during spring training due to the fact that his system rejected the takeover , and has been on the DL ever since . Contact the authorities !

Their faults were in intelligence ( military and civilian definitions apply ) , tactics ( attacking during DAYLIGHT ? ? ) , methodology ( the FBI stated that it is against government policy to assault a position where there are non-combatants/potential hostages without attempting negotiations first ) , and legality . The BATF 's jurisdiction is TAXES on firearms and tobacco . They are a branch of the department of the treasury . They have very curiously backed away from their claims of illegal weaponry to push the child-abuse charges ... The BATF has no jurisdiction over non-firearms/tobacco issues ! And the charges of child-abuse had been investigated in the past with no violence and no validation . This was a clear case of first the BATF , then the FBI , having watched too many Rambo movies ... My opinion is that the agent in charge should be charged with executing an illegal raid , criminal negligence , murder , civil rights violations , and breaking his/her oath to uphold and defend the Constitution of the US . The warrant should be unsealed to reveal to the public what justification the BATF thought it had in committing an armed assault on American citizens . And while on the issue of investigating this issue , the Randy Weaver case and the Johnny Lawmaster case should be investigated for BATF wrongdoing . James btw , if the BATF came busting in my windows with concussion grenades , you could damn well bet I would return fire to the utmost of my ability . -- ******************************************************************************** James S.

The 27th was a short day at work , we worked until eleven or eleven-thirty and left for home . I decided to go for a short walk . I went to Primorsky Park . I walked past the Eternal Flame and saw a group of about 8 to 10 people standing there . When I had walked another 15 to 20 yards I heard the screech of automobile brakes behind me . I turned my head toward the sound . It was a light blue GAZ-24 Volga . I see that the people who were standing there have gone over to the car . A man and a woman get out . The man is expensively dressed , in a suit , and the woman has a raincoat on . She does n't have anything on her head , and her hair is let down , sightly reddish hair , a heavy-set woman . They 're 40 to 45 years old . They get something out of the trunk . The people start to help them . I become curious just what are they pulling out of there ? When I got up close I heard them turn something on . I did n't see what it was , but it was probably a tape recorder . They put it on the ground near the Eternal Flame honoring the 26 Baku Commissars and formed a tight circle around it . I ask , `` What 's going on ? '' Someone tells me , `` Come listen . '' Well they were Azerbaijanis , I had asked in Azerbaijani . I hear appeals : `` Brother Muslims , our time has come . . . `` and something else along that line . I did n't understand what it was all about . I walked around the group trying to get a look at the owner of the tape recorder . But the circle drew in tighter . New people started coming from various directions , five here , seven there . And the comments started : `` Right , we should slaughter the Armenians ! '' and `` There's no need to be afraid , all of Moscow is behind us . '' I even heard that : `` All Moscow is behind us . '' Well I watched and listened in and realized that this was no joke . I quietly left and went home . Now before that at work I had heard that something was going on in Karabagh , that there were demonstrations there . Well , people were saying all kinds of things , but I did n't have any idea what was really going on . My wife and son were at home , but my daughter was at my aunt 's house in Baku . I did n't say anything to my wife . We sat and drank tea . Sometime around two o'clock right behind our house suddenly there is noise , whistling , and shouting . I looked out the window and saw a crowd . The crowd is moving slowly , like they show on TV when blacks in South Africa are striking or having a demonstration and move slowly . My wife asks what 's going on out there . I say I do n't know . I put on some outdoor clothes and went out to find out what it was all about . In the crowd people are shouting `` Down with the Armenians ! '' and `` Death to the Armenians ! '' I waited for the entire crowd to pass . At first they went down Narimanov Street on the side with the SK club and the City Party Committee ; then they turned and went against the traffic -- it 's one way there -- down the Street of the 26 Baku Commissars toward the streetcar line . I went home and told my wife there was a demonstration going on . In fact I thought that we were having the same kind of demonstrations that they had had in Yerevan and in Karabagh . Aside from the things they were shouting , I was surprised that there were only young people in the crowd . And they were minors , under draft age . My wife and son wanted to go upstairs to visit a friend , but I was kind of uneasy and said , `` No , let 's stay at home instead . '' An hour went by , or maybe an hour and a half . Well , I was n't keeping track of the time , I ca n't say exactly how long it was . I look and see another crowd on Narimanov , but now on the side with the microdistricts , the bazaar , and the Rossiya movie theater . I put outside clothes on and went out again . There 's noise , an uproar outside , and the crowd has grown . There are more people . And whereas the first time there were individual shouts , this time they are more focused , more aggressive . No , I think , something 's wrong here , this is n't any demonstration . They would run , stop , then walk quickly and make sharp dashes , and then run again . I was walking along the sidewalk and they were in the street . I followed them . I was thinking I 'd just watch and see . Who knew where this was leading ? We came out on Lenin Square . At the square the SK club is on one side , and the City Party Committee is on the other . I went toward the square and heard noise and shouting , as though the whole town had turned out . There was some sort of a rally going on . I go closer and hear exclamations , appeals . I heard both anti-Armenian and anti-Soviet appeals . `` We do n't need perestroika , we want to go on living like we have been . '' Now what did they mean by `` living like we have been ? '' The Azerbaijanis work like everyone else . But too many people live at the expense of the government and at the expense of others . Speculation , theft , and cheating go on all the time . And not just in Azerbaijan , everywhere , in all the republics , but I 've never seen it anywhere else like I have in Azerbaijan . Now at this rally someone says that they should go around to the Armenians ' apartments and drive them out , beat them and drive them out . True , I did n't hear them say `` kill them '' over the microphone , I only heard `` beat them and drive them out . '' I stayed at the square a few minutes longer . First one , then another are going up onto the stage , and no one tries to stop the crowd . Off to the side of the crowd there were small groups of three or four people , and I think they were MVD [ Ministry of Internal Affairs ] or State Security KGB . There were also uniformed policemen there , but I did n't see any of them try to pacify the crowd . New people kept coming up onto the stage . Well I had finally decided that this could end badly : This was no demonstration , and I had to protect my family . I left the Square to return home and suddenly noticed a truck . It was next to the City Party Committee , on Narimanov Street , it stood next to the tai- lor 's shop there , a low truck , and it had low , wooden panels . I see that some- thing is being unloaded , crates of some sort . I decided to go look because after all those appeals I was apprehensive and thought there might be weapons in there . They pulled the crates out onto the square , not toward the City Party Committee , but toward the SK club . And when I went right up to them I saw that they were cases of vodka . There were two people handing down the cases from the bed of the truck , and on the ground there were many people , 15 to 20 . They were handing them down from the truck and each case was carried off by two people . Two people , one case of vodka . And there was a man standing right next to the truck and he was handing out roundish black lumps , maybe about the size of a fist , maybe a little bigger or smaller . It was anasha . When I passed next to that person , he stood with his side to me . There was about a yard and a half between us , and two people were standing near him . He has a package in his hand , and he 's pulling out anasha and handing it out . I have never smoked it myself . Once I tried it for fun , but I 've seen a lot of people smoke it , I 've seen it many times , and I know what it is . I strolled around and no one asked me who I was or what I was doing there . Before I got to the Glass Bazaar I heard more howling , more warlike shouting . I turned around and saw them running . Well I 'll just keep on going like I am , I thought . When they caught up with me I saw that they were carrying flags . And I recognized the person who was carrying the flag on my side of the street . He 's a young guy , 21 or 22 years old . He was carrying a red flag , which had `` Ermeni oryum '' written on it in Azerbaijani , that means `` Death to Armenians ! '' That guy used to live off the same courtyard as us . I do n't really know what his name is , but I know his father very well . His father 's name is Rafik ; he used to be a cook , and then became head chef . He used to have a dark blue Zhiguli van , then he sold it and now he has a white Zhiguli 06 . His family , as I said , lived on the same courtyard as we did . Our building was on Narimanov Street , and theirs was on the Street of the 26 Baku Commissars ; their apartment was in the far entryway , on the fifth floor , the door on the left . Now Rafik 's little brother lives there , and he , Rafik , I heard , got a new apartment either in the forth or eighth microdistrict . In a word , his son was carrying a flag that said `` Death to Armenians ! '' I was surprised because before this I had gotten the impression that all of this nonsense was being done not by people from Sumgait , but by Azerbaijanis from Agdam and Kafan . Well anyway I went home . My wife was upset . I told her , `` It 's OK , it 'll pass , they 're young kids , they 've just gotten all whooped up . '' Naturally I did n't want her to get overly upset . After a while a new surge of crowd went by . And this time they were breaking glass . I could hear it breaking , but I could n't see where . Well I think , here we go , the machine 's in motion . They were n't handing out that vodka and anasha for nothing . I did n't see people drinking and smoking on the spot , but they certainly had n't unloaded the vodka and hashish to put in a store window ! So the thought flashed through my head that the machine was running , no one would stop them now , they were n't even trying , although , I 'll say it again , the police were there , I saw them . And it 's not just that the police were n't breaking them up , they were joking with them , they were having a good time . True , at the time I could n't even imagine that under our government , our much- vaunted leadership -- and I 'm not afraid to say these words : so many people died , So many women were abused , and how many abominations there were ! -- I could n't imagine that under our much-vaunted authorities , and if I were to be specific , I would say under the much-touted authorities in our city of Sumgait , I could n't imagine that such things could take place . When they started breaking glass I told my wife and son : `` Let 's go upstairs . '' We went to our neighbors , the Grigorians , on the fourth floor . And in the evening , when those crowds started going past again , I went outside once more . I stopped at `` The Corner , '' a place called that right next to the bazaar . I look and see a crowd on the run . And there , a few yards from the entrance to the bazaar , are three respectable-looking men of around , say , 50 years old . The crowd was running and one of the three waved with his arm and pointed toward the bazaar . And then the whole crowd , as though it were one person , wheeled and raced toward the bazaar . And not a soul went past those three , as though it were off limits ! Well everything got all churned up , there was more noise , and the glass was flying again . We spent the night at the neighbors ' . My apartment was on the first floor , there was really no way to defend yourself there . In the morning I went out to buy bread and to see what was happening in town . On the way I saw someone hunched up , still . I never found out who it was or what happened to him . There were 10 to 15 people standing near him . I got the bread and on my way back , they had gathered around the person who was lying there hunched up , sort of enclosing him ; because of the way they were standing you could n't even see him . That was on the morning of February 28 . Everyone knows the rest .

From : mcelwre @ cnsvax.uwec.edu Subject : LARSONIAN Astronomy and Physics Organization : University of Wisconsin Eau Claire Lines : 552 LARSONIAN Astronomy and Physics Orthodox physicists , astronomers , and astrophysicists CLAIM to be looking for a `` Unified Field Theory '' in which all of the forces of the universe can be explained with a single set of laws or equations . But they have been systematically IGNORING or SUPPRESSING an excellent one for 30 years ! The late Physicist Dewey B. Larson 's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe , which he calls the `` Reciprocal System '' , is built on two fundamental postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of space and time : ( 1 ) `` The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE component , MOTION , existing in THREE dimensions , in DISCRETE UNITS , and in two RECIPROCAL forms , SPACE and TIME . '' ( 2 ) `` The physical universe conforms to the relations of ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics , its magnitudes are ABSOLUTE , and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN . '' From these two postulates , Larson developed a COMPLETE Theoretical Universe , using various combinations of translational , vibrational , rotational , and vibrational- rotational MOTIONS , the concepts of IN-ward and OUT-ward SCALAR MOTIONS , and speeds in relation to the Speed of Light ( which Larson called `` UNIT VELOCITY '' and `` THE NATURAL DATUM '' ) . At each step in the development , Larson was able to MATCH objects in his Theoretical Universe with objects in the REAL physical universe , ( photons , sub-atomic particles [ INCOMPLETE ATOMS ] , charges , atoms , molecules , globular star clusters , galaxies , binary star systems , solar systems , white dwarf stars , pulsars , quasars , ETC . ) , even objects NOT YET DISCOVERED THEN ( such as EXPLODING GALAXIES , and GAMMA-RAY BURSTS ) . And applying his Theory to his NEW model of the atom , Larson was able to precisely and accurately CALCULATE inter- atomic distances in crystals and molecules , compressibility and thermal expansion of solids , and other properties of matter . All of this is described in good detail , with-OUT fancy complex mathematics , in his books . BOOKS of Dewey B. Larson The following is a complete list of the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson 's books about his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe . Some of the early books are out of print now , but still available through inter-library loan . `` The Structure of the Physical Universe '' ( 1959 ) `` The Case AGAINST the Nuclear Atom '' ( 1963 ) `` Beyond Newton '' ( 1964 ) `` New Light on Space and Time '' ( 1965 ) `` Quasars and Pulsars '' ( 1971 ) `` NOTHING BUT MOTION '' ( 1979 ) [ A $ 9.50 SUBSTITUTE for the $ 8.3 BILLION `` Super Collider '' . ] [ The last four chapters EXPLAIN chemical bonding . ] `` The Neglected Facts of Science '' ( 1982 ) `` THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION '' ( 1984 ) [ FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL astrophysical mysteries . ] `` BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER '' ( 1988 ) All but the last of these books were published by North Pacific Publishers , P.O . Box 13255 , Portland , OR 97213 , and should be available via inter-library loan if your local university or public library does n't have each of them . Several of them , INCLUDING the last one , are available from : The International Society of Unified Science ( ISUS ) , 1680 E. Atkin Ave. , Salt Lake City , Utah 84106 . This is the organization that was started to promote Larson 's Theory . They have other related publications , including the quarterly journal `` RECIPROCITY '' . Physicist Dewey B. Larson 's Background Physicist Dewey B. Larson was a retired Engineer ( Chemical or Electrical ) . He was about 91 years old when he died in May 1989 . He had a Bachelor of Science Degree in Engineering Science from Oregon State University . He developed his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe while trying to develop a way to COMPUTE chemical properties based only on the elements used . Larson 's lack of a fancy `` PH.D. '' degree might be one reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him , but it is NOT A VALID REASON . Sometimes it takes a relative outsider to CLEARLY SEE THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES . At the same time , it is clear from his books that he also knew ORTHODOX physics and astronomy as well as ANY physicist or astronomer , well enough to point out all their CONTRADICTIONS , AD HOC ASSUMPTIONS , PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE , IN-CONSISTENCIES , ETC.. Larson did NOT have the funds , etc . to experimentally test his Theory . And it was NOT necessary for him to do so . He simply compared the various parts of his Theory with OTHER researchers ' experimental and observational data . And in many cases , HIS explanation FIT BETTER . A SELF-CONSISTENT Theory is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX physicists and astronomers have ! They CLAIM to be looking for a `` unified field theory '' that works , but have been IGNORING one for over 30 years now ! `` Modern physics '' does NOT explain the physical universe so well . Some parts of some of Larson 's books are FULL of quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who agree . And remember that `` epicycles '' , `` crystal spheres '' , `` geocentricity '' , `` flat earth theory '' , etc. , ALSO once SEEMED to explain it well , but were later proved CONCEPTUALLY WRONG . Prof. Frank H. Meyer , Professor Emeritus of UW-Superior , was/is a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson 's Theory , and was ( or still is ) President of Larson 's organization , `` THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF UNIFIED SCIENCE '' , and Editor of their quarterly Journal `` RECIPROCITY '' . He moved to Minneapolis after retiring . `` Super Collider '' BOONDOGGLE ! I am AGAINST contruction of the `` Superconducting Super Collider '' , in Texas or anywhere else . It would be a GROSS WASTE of money , and contribute almost NOTHING of `` scientific '' value . Most physicists do n't realize it , but , according to the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson , as described in his books , the strange GOOFY particles ( `` mesons '' , `` hyperons '' , ALLEGED `` quarks '' , etc . ) which they are finding in EXISTING colliders ( Fermi Lab , Cern , etc . ) are really just ATOMS of ANTI-MATTER , which are CREATED by the high-energy colliding beams , and which quickly disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible with their environment . A larger and more expensive collider will ONLY create a few more elements of anti-matter that the physicists have not seen there before , and the physicists will be EVEN MORE CONFUSED THAN THEY ARE NOW ! Are a few more types of anti-matter atoms worth the $ 8.3 BILLION cost ? ! ! Do n't we have much more important uses for this WASTED money ? ! Another thing to consider is that the primary proposed location in Texas has a serious and growing problem with some kind of `` fire ants '' eating the insulation off underground cables . How much POISONING of the ground and ground water with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of the `` Supercollider '' ? ! Naming the `` Super Collider '' after Ronald Reagon , as proposed , is TOTALLY ABSURD ! If it is built , it should be named after a leading particle PHYSICIST . LARSONIAN Anti-Matter In Larson 's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe , anti-matter is NOT a simple case of opposite charges of the same types of particles . It has more to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the photons of which they are made , in relation to the vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light , which Larson calls `` Unit Velocity '' and the `` Natural Datum '' . In Larson 's Theory , a positron is actually a particle of MATTER , NOT anti-matter . When a positron and electron meet , the rotational vibrations ( charges ) and rotations of their respective photons ( of which they are made ) neutralize each other . In Larson 's Theory , the ANTI-MATTER half of the physical universe has THREE dimensions of TIME , and ONLY ONE dimension of space , and exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our MATERIAL half . LARSONIAN Relativity The perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury has been observed and precisely measured to ADVANCE at the rate of 574 seconds of arc per century . 531 seconds of this advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational perturbations from the other planets ( Venus , Earth , Jupiter , etc. ) . The remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to help `` prove '' Einstein 's `` General Theory of Relativity '' . But the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieved results CLOSER to the 43 seconds than `` General Relativity '' can , by INSTEAD using `` SPECIAL Relativity '' . In one or more of his books , he applied the LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION on the HIGH ORBITAL SPEED of Mercury . Larson TOTALLY REJECTED `` General Relativity '' as another MATHEMATICAL FANTASY . He also REJECTED most of `` Special Relativity '' , including the parts about `` mass increases '' near the speed of light , and the use of the Lorentz Transform on doppler shifts , ( Those quasars with red-shifts greater than 1.000 REALLY ARE MOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT , although most of that motion is away from us IN TIME. ) . In Larson 's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe , there are THREE dimensions of time instead of only one . But two of those dimensions can NOT be measured from our material half of the physical universe . The one dimension that we CAN measure is the CLOCK time . At low relative speeds , the values of the other two dimensions are NEGLIGIBLE ; but at high speeds , they become significant , and the Lorentz Transformation must be used as a FUDGE FACTOR . [ Larson often used the term `` COORDINATE TIME '' when writing about this . ] In regard to `` mass increases '' , it has been PROVEN in atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near the speed of light . But the formula for acceleration is ACCELERATION = FORCE / MASS , ( a = F/m ) . Orthodox physicists are IGNORING the THIRD FACTOR : FORCE . In Larson 's Theory , mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drops toward zero . FORCE is actually a MOTION , or COMBINATIONS of MOTIONS , or RELATIONS BETWEEN MOTIONS , including INward and OUTward SCALAR MOTIONS . The expansion of the universe , for example , is an OUTward SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and NOT a result of the so-called `` Big Bang '' ( which is yet another MATHEMATICAL FANTASY ) . THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION I wish to recommend to EVERYONE the book `` THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION '' , by Dewey B. Larson , 1984 , North Pacific Publishers , ( P.O . Box 13255 , Portland , Oregon 97213 ) , 456 pages , indexed , hardcover . It contains the Astrophysical portions of a GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by that author , an UNrecognized GENIUS , more than thirty years ago . It contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL Astrophysical mysteries , including the FORMATION of galaxies , binary and multiple star systems , and solar systems , the TRUE ORIGIN of the `` 3-degree '' background radiation , cosmic rays , and gamma- ray bursts , and the TRUE NATURE of quasars , pulsars , white dwarfs , exploding galaxies , etc.. It contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are ALL looking for , if they are ready to seriously consider it with OPEN MINDS ! The following is an example of his Theory 's success : In his first book in 1959 , `` THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE '' , Larson predicted the existence of EXPLODING GALAXIES , several years BEFORE astronomers started finding them . They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of Larson 's comprehensive Theory . And when QUASARS were discovered , he had an immediate related explanation for them also . GAMMA-RAY BURSTS Astro-physicists and astronomers are still scratching their heads about the mysterious GAMMA-RAY BURSTS . They were originally thought to originate from `` neutron stars '' in the disc of our galaxy . But the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in Earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions uniformly , and their source locations in space do NOT correspond to any known objects , ( except for a few cases of directional coincidence ) . Gamma-ray bursts are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of the GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson . According to page 386 of his book `` THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION '' , published in 1984 , the gamma-ray bursts are coming from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe , which Larson calls the `` Cosmic Sector '' . Because of the relationship between the anti-matter and material halves of the physical universe , and the way they are connected together , the gamma-ray bursts can pop into our material half anywhere in space , seemingly at random . ( This is WHY the source locations of the bursts do not correspond with known objects , and come from all directions uniformly . ) I wonder how close to us in space a source location would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most life on Earth ! There would be NO WAY to predict one , NOR to stop it ! Perhaps some of the MASS EXTINCTIONS of the past , which are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids , were actually caused by nearby GAMMA-RAY BURSTS ! LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation About half of all the stars in the galaxy in the vicinity of the sun are binary or double . But orthodox astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory theory about how they form or why there are so many of them . But binary star systems are actually a LIKELY CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson . I will try to summarize Larsons explanation , which is detailed in Chapter 7 of his book `` THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION '' and in some of his other books . First of all , according to Larson , stars do NOT generate energy by `` fusion '' . A small fraction comes from slow gravitational collapse . The rest results from the COMPLETE ANNIHILATION of HEAVY elements ( heavier than IRON ) . Each element has a DESTRUCTIVE TEMPERATURE LIMIT . The heavier the element is , the lower is this limit . A star 's internal temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays , gradually reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and lighter elements . When the internal temperature of the star reaches the destructive temperature limit of IRON , there is a Type I SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION ! This is because there is SO MUCH iron present ; and that is related to the structure of iron atoms and the atom building process , which Larson explains in some of his books [ better than I can ] . When the star explodes , the lighter material on the outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less than the speed of light . The heavier material in the center portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to the speed of light , because of the high temperature . The explosion pushes that material OVER the speed of light , and it expands OUTWARD IN TIME , which is equivalent to INWARD IN SPACE , and it often actually DISAPPEARS for a while . Over long periods of time , both masses start to fall back gravitationally . The material that had been blown outward in space now starts to form a RED GIANT star . The material that had been blown OUTWARD IN TIME starts to form a WHITE DWARF star . BOTH stars then start moving back toward the `` MAIN SEQUENCE '' from opposite directions on the H-R Diagram . The chances of the two masses falling back into the exact same location in space , making a single lone star again , are near zero . They will instead form a BINARY system , orbiting each other . According to Larson , a white dwarf star has an INVERSE DENSITY GRADIENT ( is densest at its SURFACE ) , because the material at its center is most widely dispersed ( blown outward ) in time . This ELIMINATES the need to resort to MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES about `` degenerate matter '' , `` neutron stars '' , `` black holes '' , etc.. LARSONIAN Solar System Formation If the mass of the heavy material at the center of the exploding star is relatively SMALL , then , instead of a single white dwarf star , there will be SEVERAL `` mini '' white dwarf stars ( revolving around the red giant star , but probably still too far away in three-dimensional TIME to be affected by its heat , etc. ) . These will become PLANETS ! In Chapter 7 of THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION , Larson used all this information , and other principles of his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe , to derive his own version of Bode 's Law . `` Black Hole '' FANTASY ! I heard that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of TWO `` black holes '' merging together into a SINGLE `` black hole '' , and concluded that the new `` black hole '' would have MORE MASS than the sum of the two original `` black holes '' . Such a result should be recognized by EVERYone as a RED FLAG , causing widespread DOUBT about the whole IDEA of `` black holes '' , etc. ! After reading Physicist Dewey B. Larson 's books about his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe , especially his book `` THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION '' , it is clear to me that `` black holes '' are NOTHING more than MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES ! The strange object at Cygnus X-1 is just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR , NOT the `` black hole '' that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want to `` prove '' their theory . By the way , I do NOT understand why so much publicity is being given to physicist Stephen Hawking . The physicists and astronomers seem to be acting as if Hawking 's severe physical problem somehow makes him `` wiser '' . It does NOT ! I wish the same attention had been given to Physicist Dewey B. Larson while he was still alive . Widespread publicity and attention should NOW be given to Larson 's Theory , books , and organization ( The International Society of Unified Science ) . ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION I heard of that concept many years ago , in connection with UFO 's and unorthodox inventors , but I never was able to find out how or why they work , or how they are constructed . I found a possible clue about why they might work on pages 112-113 of the book `` BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER '' , by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson , which describes part of Larson 's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe . I quote one paragraph : `` As indicated in the preceding chapter , the development of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally different concept of the nature of electrical resistance . The electrons , we find , are derived from the environment . It was brought out in Volume I [ Larson 's book `` NOTHING BUT MOTION '' ] that there are physical processes in operation which produce electrons in substantial quantities , and that , although the motions that constitute these electrons are , in many cases , absorbed by atomic structures , the opportunities for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are limited . It follows that there is always a large excess of free electrons in the material sector [ material half ] of the universe , most of which are uncharged . In this uncharged state the electrons can not move with respect to extension space , because they are inherently rotating units of space , and the relation of space to space is not motion . In open space , therefore , each uncharged electron remains permanently in the same location with respect to the natural reference system , in the manner of a photon . In the context of the stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron , like the photon , is carried outward at the speed of light by the progression of the natural reference system . All material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation . Meanwhile there are other processes , to be discussed later , whereby electrons are returned to the environment . The electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level . '' Note that in Larson 's Theory , UNcharged electrons are also massLESS , and are basically photons of light of a particular frequency ( above the `` unit '' frequency ) spinning around one axis at a particular rate ( below the `` unit '' rate ) . ( `` Unit velocity '' is the speed of light , and there are vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light , according to Larson 's Theory . ) [ I might have the `` above '' and `` below '' labels mixed up . ] Larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass- LESS UN-charged electrons flying around at the speed of light ! If this is true , then the ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these electrons , or other particles in space , perhaps GIVING them a charge ( and mass ) and shooting them toward the rear to achieve propulsion . ( In Larson 's Theory , an electrical charge is a one-dimensional rotational vibration of a particular frequency ( above the `` unit '' frequency ) superimposed on the rotation of the particle . ) The paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is generated in clouds . SUPPRESSION of LARSONIAN Physics The comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson has been available for more than 30 YEARS , published in 1959 in his first book `` THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE '' . It is TOTALLY UN-SCIENTIFIC for Hawking , Wheeler , Sagan , and the other SACRED PRIESTS of the RELIGION they call `` science '' ( or `` physics '' , or `` astronomy '' , etc . ) , as well as the `` scientific '' literature and the `` education '' systems , to TOTALLY IGNORE Larson 's Theory has they have . Larson 's Theory has excellent explanations for many things now puzzling orthodox physicists and astronomers , such as gamma-ray bursts and the nature of quasars . Larson 's Theory deserves to be HONESTLY and OPENLY discussed in the physics , chemistry , and astronomy journals , in the U.S. and elsewhere . And at least the basic principles of Larson 's Theory should be included in all related courses at UW-EC , UW-Madison , Cambridge , Cornell University , and elsewhere , so that students are not kept in the dark about a worthy alternative to the DOGMA they are being fed . For more information , answers to your questions , etc. , please consult my CITED SOURCES ( especially Larson 's BOOKS ) .

If his defense is good enough for Greenville , or Richmond , it 's good enough for Atlanta . If he really was awful defensively , he would no longer be a catcher . See Sprague , Ed . > Now .

The kid *will* improve playing at AAA , and > he probably wo n't being a reserve with the big club . Oh , where to start ... OK. First of all , solid ! = good . I want good players . Solid is one of those words used to describe nice white guys who really are n't very good at baseball . Think of it as `` TWG '' without the caps . It 's a losing strategy to say , `` We have solid guys , we do n't need to improve . '' You used it four times in that paragraph , BTW . Same for experienced . I might add , though , that Greg Olson and Damon Berryhill are n't exactly Carter and Fisk . Olson has played three years , Berryhill five , although 90 and 91 were a wash . The only difference , IMHO , between Olson and Valle is the supporting cast . `` Two big bats . '' Hrm . I like Justice , but I find Mr. Gant 's trend disturbing . Call it one and a maybe . The Braves ' platoon is OK , but neither player has *any* value outside of the platoon . Bream vs. LH and Hunter vs. RH are awful . I 'll leave the thirdbase comment alone . Pendleton has wasted too much bandwidth already . If the CF platoon hits .300 , I 'll retrace Mr. Likhani 's midnight run down Forbes , and I live in NY and LA .

I hope somebody out here can help me . I am currently working on a project where I am trying to communicate from an IBM 386 with Phoenix BIOS , using C++ , to a board that I made with an Intel 8085 CPU with UART chip . The board works fine with the TRANSMIT command and Terminal Emulation mode of Kermit , but there seems to be something wrong with the initialization or protocol used when I try C++ . I need to access the unit I built using C , because I have a sizable chunk of C code that I will be using to perform calculations and operations that will be very difficult to code in assembly language for the 8085 . I have included the assembly code that I am running and the C++ code that I am trying to use . If anyone can show me something that I am doing blatantly incorrectly or that I am missing because of my lack of knowledge about RS-232 serial communications , please e-mail me . I wrote the assembly language to wait for a character to be received and then to check it against the 0x20 character , if a 0x20 is received , the LEDs will indicate this . Two C++ programs that I have written do nothing , but set up COM port 2 and send the 0x20 character . One uses the bioscom ( ) function in bios.h the other uses the software interrupt int86 ( ) function in dos.h .

For all of us have become like one who is unclean , And all our righteous deeds are like a filthy garment ; And all of us wither like a leaf , and our iniquities , like the wind , take us away . -Isaiah 64:6 , NAS Our prayers like the rest of our deeds are too unholy to go directly to the Father because they are tainted by our sin . Only by washing these prayers with Christ 's blood are they worthy to be lifted to to the Father . `` First , I thank my God through Christ Jesus . . .

Is this the joke of the month ? 1 . Your fascist grandparents exterminated 2.5 million Muslim people between 1914 and 1920 . 2 . Your Nazi parents fully participated in the extermination of the European Jewry during WWII . 3 . Your criminal cousins have been slaughtering Muslim women , children and elderly people in fascist x-Soviet Armenia and Karabag for the last four years . The entire population of x-Soviet Armenia now , as a result of the Genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people , are Armenians . For nearly one thousand years , the Turkish and Kurdish people lived on their homeland - the last one hundred under the oppressive Soviet and Armenian occupation . The persecutions culminated in 1914 : The Armenian Government planned and carried out a Genocide against its Muslim subjects . 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were murdered and the remainder driven out of their homeland . After one thousand years , Turkish and Kurdish lands were empty of Turks and Kurds . The survivors found a safe heaven in Turkiye . Today , x-Soviet Armenian government rejects the right of Turks and Kurds to return to their Muslim lands occupied by x-Soviet Armenia . Today , x-Soviet Armenian government covers up the genocide perpetrated by its predecessors and is therefore an accessory to this crime against humanity . x-Soviet Armenian government must pay for their crime of genocide against the Muslims by admitting to the crime and making reparations to the Turks and Kurds . Turks and Kurds demand the right to return to their lands , to determine their own future as a nation in their own homeland . During the 78th Anniversary , we come once again reiterate the unity of the Muslim People , the timelessness of the Turkish and Kurdish Demands and the desire to pursue the struggle for that restitution - a struggle that unites all Turks and Kurds . Today , we appeal to all Turkish and Kurdish people in the United States and Canada to participate en masse in the Commemorative Events , be they cultural , political or religious . Serdar Argic 'We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the Turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination .

The excerpt from Time magazine that I included in this post is > an excellent example of how organizations like the DEA attempt to > deceive the public . Unfortunately , there 's not much we can learn from the statistics presented here either . Due to rounding , the 1991 est . for LSD could be anywhere from .550 to .649 and the 1992 est . could be anywhere from .850 to .949 . This means that the actual change ( if you believe these statistics in the first place ) was anywhere from 31 % to 73 % . Similarly the increase in cocaine use could be anywhere from 18 % to 66 % and the increase of crack use could be anywhere from 29 % to 120 % . This does n't even take into account the margin of error which is n't provided here . This does not mean that the rest of the argument you present is unfounded , but it does mean that USA Today has ( not surprisingly ) provided us with virtually no information .

( Hint : serving a search warrant is NOT sufficient provocation to stage a military style assault on a religious group . At Least not here in the US . Maybe in Iraq , or Syria ... ) With the arms build up in Waco they needed to hit that compound with mega fire power . They could of gone in there blasting and killed a few women and kids but it would of been better then letting them all burn to death 51 days later . This is a joke , right ?

The moderator of the firearms-politics mailing list , Karl Kleinpaste , has agreed to set up an anonymous ftp archive directory for RKBA related information . This directory can be used for things like articles by Kates , Wright , Tonso , Levinson , Supreme Court Decisions , the RIA vs US decision , copies of legislation , and so on . It 's not meant to be for the discussions that normally appear here . So , in the future if you 're looking for something check there first and then ask here . Instructions : Short version for techies : The site is godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu . Place contributions into the directory /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba . The ftp commands get , put , mget , or mput should work . Give the command `` type binary '' to be sure files are transferred correctly . Your files will be moved to the rkba directory . To get a file use the commands get or mget . I will maintain an index which you should get first to check if the file you want to read or write already is archived . Long version for non-techies : In order for you to use this archive your computer must be on the Internet . To connect to the archive site run the command : ftp godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu If that does n't work you can not use this archive . If the ftp command is successful you 'll get this prompt asking you for a login : Name ( godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu : lvc ) : Instead of lvc your initials will appear . Answer this prompt with : ftp Next you 'll get this prompt asking your for your e-mail address : Guest login ok , send e-mail address as password : I would enter : l.v.cipriani @ att.com You 'll enter your own e-mail address . You 'll get these lines or similar as output : Remote system is UNIX . Using binary mode to transfer files . Next , the command prompt is printed : ftp > If you do not get the line `` Using binary mode to transfer files . '' Run the command : type binary Now you 're logged in to the archive machine . There are many directories on this machine but the two you are concerned with are /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba and /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/incoming There are subdirectories to the rkba directory , those are discussed below . When you login to the system your directory is /usr0/anon . To retreive files change your current directory to the rkba directory with the command : cd /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba or cd pub/firearms/politics/rkba To submit files change your directory to the incoming directory with the command : cd /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/incoming or cd pub/firearms/politics/incoming Once you do this you 'll get another ftp > prompt asking you to enter another command . To find the names of the existing files in the directory you are in run the command : ls -l This will produce something like : total 6021 -r -- r -- r -- 1 karl 6932 Jun 16 1992 DMN_Gratia_CCP -r -- r -- r -- 1 karl 69149 Apr 5 19:20 INDEX -r -- r -- r -- 1 karl 18965 Jun 16 1992 Knox_AW_lies -r -- r -- r -- 1 karl 10930 Apr 30 1992 S361 -r -- r -- r -- 1 karl 8958 Jun 16 1992 WSJ_Crimestrike -r -- r -- r -- 1 karl 2649 Jan 13 18:33 academia-bias -r -- r -- r -- 1 karl 935 Mar 22 22:38 academics -r -- r -- r -- 1 karl 36079 Aug 4 1992 aclu ... and so on ... Each line corresponds to one file . Reading right to left , the fields are the file name , the last modification date of the file , the size of the file in bytes , and some permission fields which you do not need to be concerned with . To get a file run the command `` get '' followed by the name of the file you want , for example : get INDEX or get noduty After the file is transfered to your machine a message like this : Transfer complete . 19580 bytes received in 5 seconds ( 4 Kbytes/s ) You can repeat the get command for every file you want to retreive . You can use the mget command to retreive multiple files . If the file you want is in a subdirectory , for example , congress/103rd/HR1025 you should change your directory to the appropriate subdirectory first and then retrieve it : cd congress/103rd get HR1025 Once you 're finished you can log off with the command : quit If you have a file you want to contribute the procedure is a little different . First of all you should find out if the file already exists , so get a copy of the index file with the procedure above and look it over to make sure you would n't repeat an entry . The index will have a description of each of the files in the rkba directory . For example : -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- File : whitemanslaw White Man 's Law by William R. Tonso , from the December 1985 Reason magazine -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Once you 've determined you wo n't be duplicating an entry , login and change to the incoming directory command ( see above ) . Once you are in the incoming directory use the command : put file_name In this case : put whitemanslaw Again there 'll be a `` Transfer complete , so many bytes transfered in so many seconds '' message . Now your file is on the archive machine . Another thing to watch out for is duplicate file /names/ . Be sure there is n't a file in the incoming directory that is called the same as the file you want to write . If you use the same name you'll overwrite the previous file [ or you 'll get an error message ] . Your file may have to be renamed if there is a conflict with a file by the same name in the rkba directory . Once your file is in the incoming directory send me an entry for the INDEX file and I will add it to the file . If you can not use anonymous ftp and would still like to contribute a file email the file to me and I 'll take care of the rest . If you submit a file and do not notify me it may be removed , so be sure to let me know first . If you have any questions feel free to ask me . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Larry Cipriani -- l.v.cipriani @ att.com -- Michael Phelps , ( external ) mjp @ vnet.ibm.com ..

This was an open question . I assumed that if Mr. Archer is a chronic liar , someone whould have documented it . This assumption is based on how talk.origins regulars have documented numerous cases of Creationist deceptions ( such as Duane Guish and his friends ) . No long list of Archer mistakes has yet been given , so this may be just an isolated incident ... -- Dale Skiba

At the time this seemed the thing to do as the documentation I had with my Adaptec SCSI controller said that this is the driver to be used with CD-ROM drives . Since then I have learn that this driver is out of date in a major way and that Adaptec have an upgrade deal for going to the next driver ( I think it 's called EZI-SCSI or something ) . I was n't too fussed about this until I upgraded by CD-ROM drive from a Sony CDU-541 to a Sony CDU-641 . I now find that the audio-mode will not work . I assume it is not being handled correctly by the ASW-410 driver . So , should I chase Adaptec for an upgrade ? If so does anyone know their FAX number ? Any assistance appreciated .

What I would like to see is some serious discussion of this incident . I believe the moves made were right and proper , but I still have some problems with some of the tactics . After watching the ABC special on it tonight , as well as CNN and Nightline , I question some of the ATF and FBI actions . 1 ) Could it have been possible to have taken Koresh outside the compound at some time before the Feb. 28th raid ? 2 ) Could a further wait have resulted in a different outcome . 3 ) Were FBI actions ( blaring loudspeakers , etc . ) the `` right '' course of action ? And a few other questions . Like I said , I believe the actions taken , in general , were proper . But I still have some reservations . One other point , I 'm no fan of Janet Reno , but I do like the way she had the '' balls '' to go ahead and take full responsibility .

Platform : 386/486 class machine . 800x600-16 or 1024x728-16 VGA graphics ( speed is important , 16-color for non-rendering purpose is enough ; may stay at 800x600 for speed reason . ) ( hope the code would be generic enough for different SVGA cards .

Presumably in assembly languagine . Yes , VERY FAST please . 2 ) related codes to help rotating/zooming/animating the drawings on screen .

The optoisolator is a 4N35 . On the led side , I put the signal I want through a 10k resistor to the base of a 2N2222 . On the transistor side , I tie my cpu input line to the collector which has a pull-up resistor of 47k . It functions OK , but seems VERY slow . I can detect pulses that occur at about 2kHz , but not much faster . Is n't the rise/fall time of this device , something like 5uS ? I should be able to detect my target of 40kHz , but I ca n't get 16kHz . This is done using wire-wrap and the wires going to the cpu and to the test pin are about 8 inches long , but I 'm not doing anything high-speed .

Ipser , Jr. , 1993 > Here 's my own top ten response to Mr. Ipser 's list 10 . It 's about time we have a President that might actually stand up to the military . Our men and women in uniform must learn that the world does not revolve around them , and that one of the things they 're out there defending is our right to be critical of them , even denounce them . 9 . Let me explain something to you . Environmental policy and industrial policy MUST go hand in hand . Our nation , and indeed , our planet can not afford to continue ignoring this as was done over the last twelve years . Our industrial/environmental position has been downright SHAMEFUL ! We must have active government support of the key industries such as , telecommunications , microelectronics , medical , biotech , and environmental tech . Meanwhile weed out old , inneficient , high-polution , industries that are better left to other nations . This will make us richer , help produce new jobs , and help the environment . To give credit where credit is due , I heard a lot of this in a speech by Senator John Kerry ( D-MA ) tonite . In addition , it 's time we get really , really serious about issues like overpopulation , globabl warming , and ozone depletion . The planet on which we live should be our utmost priority ! 8 . It just so happens that that it takes money to make this country work , to provide the services that people need , and to help solve the problems that need to be solved . Granted , some things can probably be done more efficiently for less money , and should be . But some things are going to cost more money and I 'm sick and tired of hearing everyone whining about taxes all the time . You want to live in my country , you pay your fair share ! 7 . I ca n't believe what hypocrites people are when they ask people to give up their lives for their country and then complain about taxes . If you're willing to send me off to die for some stupid obsession with fighting an enemy which at best does n't affect us and at worst really should be our friend , then you have no right to tell me you should n't pay taxes ! 6 . Hey , I think the beaded curtains add a lovely 60's-esque touch ! 5 . Look , Canada , Europe , and Japan manage to provide health care for their citizens ( and , yes , basic health IS a human right which people are entitled to ) . If these nations are n't capitalist enough for you , then I guess we 've found something better than capitalism ! There is nothing sacred about the capitalist system , and if something , be it socialism or anything else , works better , then I say let capitalism die . 4 . Make love , not War ! 3 . Contrary to popular belief , it is possible to be a male and a feminist at the same time . To discriminate against or to deny equal opportunity to a MAJORITY of the population is just plain wrong , and trying to force them into some sort of tradition role is even worse . Women certainly have as much to offer this world as men , and the day that gender discrimination is finally broken it going to make all the revolutions of the past few centuries seem like reform bills . I look forward to it . 2 . See number 10 . 1 . HEY MAN , ACADAMIA RULES ! ! -Amar Chaudhary Peace , Land , at Matzoh ! `` AC in DC in 2008 !

Everyone 's property rights were > protected ; the plaintiffs were made whole ; unnecessary settlement > costs were avoided . Okay , now here 's my interpretation of _Boomer_ , based on the facts as presented in the New York Court of Appeals < * > holding ( _Boomer v. < * > Note : The New York Court of Appeals is the highest court in New York State . While the United States and 48 of the fifty states call their highest court `` Supreme Court , '' `` Supreme Judicial Court '' or `` Supreme Court of Appeals , '' Maryland and New York call theirs simply the `` Court of Appeals . '' To make matters worse , New York also calls its _second-highest_ court the `` Supreme Court , Appellate Division '' ... Atlantic Cement Co._ , 26 N.Y.2d 219 , 257 N.E.2d 870 ( 1970 ) ) : Oscar H. Boomer , et al. , owned land near the Atlantic Cement company's plant near Albany , N.Y. ( The fact pattern gives no information as to which came first , the plaintiff 's acquisition of the land or he defendant 's start of production at their cement plant . ) In the course of its regular operations , the cement plant did injury to the plaintiffs ' property via dirt , smoke and vibrations emanating from the plant . The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief -- that is , they asked the court to order Atlantic Cement to stop damaging their property . ( Commentary : this seems entirely reasonable to me . Boomer at al owned their property and , presumably , a right to quiet enjoyment of it . Atlantic Cement 's actions were depriving Boomer et al of that right . ) Instead of granting the plaintiffs ' request for an injunction , the court ordered them to accept the damage being done to their property , provided that Atlantic Cement paid them $ 185,000 in compensatory damages . In other words , the court granted Atlantic Cement Co. , a private party , the power and authority to _take_ the plaintiffs rights to quiet enjoyment of their property by eminent domain . A taking by eminent domain is always problematical even when it 's done by the state ; allowing a private firm to do it is , in my opinion , totally wrong . ( Yes , I know , the _Boomer_ court did n't call it eminent domain . But if it walks like eminent domain and swims like eminent domain and quacks like eminent domain ... ) Let me take issue with the way you 've presented the case ... you say that '' What happened in _Boomer_ was that the judge did n't allow the plaintiffs to blackmail the cement plant by demanding a multi-million dollar plant to be shut down over $ 185,000 in damages . '' Blackmail ? ( Pulls out Black 's Law Dictionary , Abridged 5th Edition ... . `` Blackmail : Unlawful demand of money or property under threat to do bodily harm , to injure property , to accuse of crime , or to expose disgraceful defects . This crime is commonly included under extortion statutes . '' ) How do you define as `` blackmail '' one party 's act of demanding the right to set its own sale price for a unique piece of property which it owns and which another party has expressed an interest in buying ? Or of demanding the right not to sell that property at any price ? As I see it , Boomer et al , having found themselves in the fortunate position of owning something which Atlantic Cement had to purchase if it wanted to stay in business , had every right in the world to set whatever price they wanted . There is n't , or at least should n't be , any law that says that you have to be a nice guy in your private business dealings . You go on to say : `` The plant would never have been shut down -- the plaintiff 's lawyers would have just negotiated a windfall settlement , because the plaintiffs would prefer an amount greater than $ 185K to having the plant shut down , while the plant would prefer any amount less than the value of the plant to have the plant continue in operation . '' If so , so what ? Since when are the courts supposed to be in the business of preventing parties from reaping windfall settlements from other parties when those settlements arise from wrongful acts by those other parties ? If Atlantic Cement did n't want to have to face a choice between paying a windfall settlement or going out of business , well , should n't Atlantic Cement have thought of that before going _into_ business ? ( I note that as far as the facts show Boomer et al were _not_ the parties responsible for bringing about this situation -- that was Atlantic Cement 's own fault for choosing to build and operate the type of plant they did where and when they did . ) And then you say : `` Everyone 's property rights were protected ; the plaintiffs were made whole ; unnecessary settlement costs were avoided . '' As above , I dispute your claim that the plaintiffs were `` made whole . '' They were , in fact , by court action deprived of their rights as owners of property to choose to sell or not sell that property at a price acceptable to them . And for that deprivation they were _not_ made whole . And again I ask : Since when are the courts supposed to be in the business of ensuring that `` unnecessary '' settlement costs are avoided ? ( If so , I 've been miseducated -- I always thought that the courts were supposed to be in the business of ensuring that justice is done . ) > Is _Boomer_ really being taught as `` infamous ? '' That 's really sad if > it is , because I fail to see how it 's less than completely sensible . > You should read the law and economics stuff first-hand instead of > filtered through teachers who clearly do n't like it , for whatever > inexplicable reasons . ( 1 ) _Boomer_ is not being taught as `` infamous , '' at least not at my school . ( Aside : Northeastern Law usually does a very good job of hiring for their first-year , mandatory classes ( such as Torts , where I first encountered _Boomer_ ) instructors who , regardless of their personal opinions , can and do teach the law neutrally . When the students get into their second and third years , in which the students ( a ) can pick and choose which courses to take ( except for the mandatory Professional Responsibility , of course ) and ( b ) are presumed to be a bit more worldly and self-confident , less likely to be consciously or sub-consciously intimidated by Law School Professors and able to learn from openly biased instructors rather than be indoctrinated by them , the instructors tend to be more open in expressing their own opinions . This is especially true of part-time instructors who , in real life , are practicing attorneys or sitting judges ... this can be _very_ educational , sometimes far more so than being taught by a somewhat cloistered scholar . End of aside . ) I called it infamous because that 's my opinion of it . For the reasons I 've stated above , I believe it to be a triumph of something that I can only call `` economic correctness '' over justice . ( 2 ) It is `` completely sensible '' only if you believe that the alleged right of the owners of Atlantic Cement to stay in business and avoid losing a lot of their own money due to their own wrongful act , and the alleged right of several hundred Atlantic Cement employees to not have their jobs disappear , should trump the rights of people who own property which was damaged by Atlantic Cement 's wrongful acts . ( And if you believe that it is correct for the courts ( or any other branch of government ) to grant to private parties the right to take other people 's property by eminent domain . ) > You 'd like Posner , Bill . He 's a libertarian . Really ? I did n't know that ... what , if anything , has he had to say about cases like _Boomer_ ? > Of course , he has too much of a paper trail to ever be nominated by a > president , Democrat ( wo n't like his antitrust stance ) or Republican > ( wo n't like his support of gay marriage ) , and if bright law students > `` shiver '' at what they do n't understand , it 's easy to imagine how the > press will play it up as baby-selling . ( I 've seen Mike Godwin claim > that Posner asserts that law and economics is applicable to everything > and is the end-all and be-all , when Posner says precisely the > opposite . ) So it goes . I 've admitted that my understanding of the field generally referred to as `` law and economics '' is weak . If it advocates the use of economical analysis as one of many `` tie-breaker '' factors which courts may use to help them reach decisions in cases in which the dispute , as measured by the scale of `` justice '' , is evenly balanced , fine . But as illustrated by _Boomer_ , it is _not_ fine when the courts start viewing the economics of a case as being more important than the justice of a case . -- William December Starr < wdstarr @ athena.mit.edu >

From : artmel @ well.sf.ca.us ( Arthur Melnick ) Subject : Big Brother ( Clipper ) chip Summary : Some thoughts on the use of the Big Brother ( Clipper ) chip Keywords : clipper Nntp-Posting-Host : well.sf.ca.us Organization : The Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link , Sausalito , CA Lines : 57 There are some issues which come to mind when one considers the law enforcement aspects of the use of the Big Brother ( Clipper ) chip . The drug dealers and terrorists are n't going to let themselves be caught by using this type of encryption . In 1985 the New York Times reported that government investigators broke up a narcotics ring that was operating highly sophisticated equipment capable of allowing the leaders of the ring to eavesdrop on the law-enforcement agents who were trying to arrest them . A Mr. Deely , an NSA official , said `` There are a lot of medium-sized countries that would have been proud to have the signals intelligence operation of this group . '' For every John Gotti there are probably many more people who have the sophistication to know what the risks of unsecure communications are . The press given to the Big Brother chip will only increase their numbers . Even if there is some benefit to law-enforcement through the use of Big Brother , it must be weighed against the constitutional and civil liberties questions involved . For example , in some areas of the world torture is used as an investigative tool by the local `` law-enforcement '' people . I suspect it is an effective means of obtaining information and shortening many investigations . It probably also helps keep the conviction rate high . The fact that the torture tool is not used in this country ( even with a court order obtained by showing `` probable cause '' ) is because we have rightly balanced the questions of expediency and what is ethically and morally right . I think that the same question of expediency versus morality should come into play when considering the use of Big Brother . I vote for morality . I am quite disturbed by what I interpret as a veiled threat to prohibit the use of all encryption if this Big Brother chip is not put into wide spread use . After a quick reading of the White House press release I came away with that impression . To most of the American public , the word `` hacker '' has rightly or wrongly come to mean `` high tech adolescent vandal '' . It has struck me that most of the people posting to sci.crypt regarding this issue are intelligent , thoughtful individuals who have genuine concerns about the privacy and constitutional issues surrounding Big Brother . I hope that the use of Big Brother does not become mandatory and other encryption become illegal . I would hate to see this become some kind of high tech Volstead Act . The high speed digital communications revolution is coming at us with the speed of an SST . The times they are a changing , and just as IBM is learning that they ca n't do business the same way they have done it for the past 40 years , maybe NSA should evaluate another approach . EFF , who have correctly questioned the cryptographic strength of Big Brother , may need to send a stronger message out regarding the constitutional issues involved . Al Gore may want to think this one through a little more . And as for Dorothy Elizabeth Robling Denning : En quoi cela vous concerne , cheri ?

The analogy does not depend on the premisses being true , because the question under discussion is not truth but arrogance . A similar analogy might be a medical doctor who believes that a blood transfusion is necessary to save the life of a child whose parents are Jehovah 's Witnesses and so have conscientious objections to blood transfusion . The doctor 's efforts to persuade them to agree to a blood transfusion could be perceived to be arrogant in precisely the same way as Christians could be perceived to be arrogant . The truth or otherwise of the belief that a blood transfusion is necessary to save the life of the child is irrelevant here . What matters is that the doctor BELIEVES it to be true , and could be seen to be trying to foce his beliefs on the parents , and this could well be perceived as arrogance . ============================================================ Steve Hayes , Department of Missiology & Editorial Department Univ . of South Africa , P.O .

From : ernie @ woody.apana.org.au ( Ernie Elu ) Subject : MGR NAPLPS & GUI BBS Frontends Organization : Woody - Public Access Linux - Melbourne Lines : 28 X-Newsreader : TIN [ version 1.1 PL9 ] Hi all , I am looking into methods I can use to turn my Linux based BBS into a full color Graphical BBS that supports PC , Mac , Linux , and Amiga callers . Originally I was inspired by the NAPLPS graphics standard ( a summary of which hit this group about 2 weeks ago ) . Following up on software availability of NAPLPS supporting software I find that most terminal programs are commercial the only resonable shareware one being PP3 which runs soley on MSDOS machines leaving Mac and Amiga users to buy full commercial software if they want to try out the BBS ( I know I would n't ) Next most interesting possibility is to port MGR to PC , Mac , Amiga . I know there is an old version of a Mac port on bellcore.com that does n't work under System 7 But I ca n't seem to find the source anywhere to see if I can patch it . Is there a color version of MGR for Linux ? I know there was an alpha version of the libs out last year but I misplaced it . Does anyone on this group know if MGR as been ported to PC or Amiga ? I ca n't seem to send a message to the MGR channel without it bouncing . Does anyone have any other suggestions for a Linux based GUI BBS ? Thanks in advan

From : jca2 @ cec1.wustl.edu ( Joseph Charles Achkar ) Subject : Blues into playoffs , beat TB 6-5 Keywords : Blues , Shanahan , Joseph , Hull , Minnesota , TB Nntp-Posting-Host : cec1 Organization : Washington University , St. Louis MO Lines : 127 By Dave Luecking Of The Post-Dispatch Staff At 9:11 Thursday night , the scoreboard watchers at The Arena began to cheer . Their cheer quickly turned into a roar , and finally , the sellout crowd of 17,816 rose as one to rock the old barn at 5700 Oakland Avenue in a salute to the playoff-bound Blues . The scoreboard had just flashed the news from Detroit -- Red Wings 5 , Stars 3 . With the North Stars ' loss , the Blues officially clinched fourth place and the final playoff spot in the Norris Division . Good thing , because the Blues quit playing . They held a 5-1 lead over Tampa Bay when the Detroit-Minnesota final appeared with 3 minutes 52 remaining in the second period . They promptly went to sleep and barely held on for a 6-5 victory that nearly slipped away at the buzzer . Tampa 's Bob Beers tipped in a pass from Shawn Chambers , but officiating supervisor John D'Amico and video goal judge Rich Schweigler ruled that the shot had gone into the net after time had expired . `` I 'm glad I did n't see it go in at the end , '' Blues coach Bob Berry said . If the goal had counted , he 'd have been more upset than he was by the Blues' disappearance in the final 24 minutes . Holding on for the victory and making the playoffs tempered Berry 's anger . `` It was n't pretty at the end , '' he said . `` We played 36 , 37 great minutes , as good as we played all year . It slipped away at the end . It should n't have , but it did . '' Still , the Blues won , prompting another ovation from the crowd at game 's end . Despite their shoddy effort in the third period and all the turmoil this season , the Blues still made the playoffs . They 'll meet the Chicago Blackhawks in a best-of-seven Norris Division semifinal , beginning at noon Sunday at Chicago Stadium . The Blues finished the regular-season with a record of 37-36-11 for 85 points , their fourth consecutive plus-.500 season . Minnesota finished three points behind in fifth place , with a record of 36-38- 10 for 82 points . Tampa Bay , which played spoiler last week by tying the Blues 2-2 at Tampa , ended its first season with a record of 23-54-7 for 53 points . The poor finish cast an unnecessary shadow over what should have been a joyous Blues locker room . Instead , the mood was one of relief and some disappointment . `` It 's a shame we let down , '' said Kevin Miller , one of three Blues to score two goals . Brendan Shanahan and Bob Bassen were the others . `` There was no need for a letdown . If we 'd have kept working , it would have ended 6-2 and everyone would be happy . '' Instead , a lot of players were happy just to make the playoffs . `` We won , and that 's all that matters , '' said Brett Hull , scoreless and minus-3 for the night . `` Once we got up 4-0 , it was really tough to play . '' Some players did n't have a problem . `` Just because the score was announced , our line did n't quit , '' said Rich Sutter , who played with Bassen and Miller . `` We still had a game to play . You ca n't allow five goals like we did , that 's not right . `` It was disappointing to see what was going on . '' Bassen was almost frantic on the bench because of the Blues ' effort . Somehow , he missed the announcement of Minnesota 's loss . `` I did n't know it was final , '' he said . `` I was kind of looking around on the bench . I did n't realize it was a final for some reason . We 're in the playoffs , and that 's great , but it 's a little disappointing to play like we did at the end . '' The letdown was precisely the reason that Berry had instructed the scoreboard operators to keep the Minnesota-Detroit score off of the board . The score showed 0-0 until it first popped up with Detroit leading 4-2 in the third period . The Blues already led 4-0 at the time . `` I told them I did n't want to see the score , I did n't want to know the score , '' Berry said . `` I felt we had to win the game , and that 's the approach we took . '' If Minnesota took a lead , Berry feared , the pressure of having to win might bother the Blues . If Detroit led , he worried , the Blues might quit . Until the announcement , the Blues played splendidly . Shanahan got the crowd going at 10:44 of the first period , scoring his 50th of the season . Then , Miller and Bassen took charge late in the period . With the teams playing four on four , Miller broke in on left wing , deked defenseman Roman Hamrlik and beat former Blues goalie Pat Jablonski with the rebound of his own shot with 21.6 seconds remaining in the period . Then , just 10.5 seconds later , Bassen rifled a long slap shot past Jablonski after defenseman Rick Zombo intercepted a Tampa pass in the neutral zone . Bassen made it 4-0 just 14 seconds into the second period , scoring on the rebound of Bret Hedican 's shot . The goal gave him his first two-goal game of the season and reminded him of a special friend . Last year , Bassen befriended young Oliver Mulvihill , who died of a rare form of cancer at age 6 on Feb. 23 . `` I was thinking of my buddy Oliver , '' Bassen said . `` He 's in heaven now , and I know he was watching . I know he 's happy . '' Miller increased the Blues lead to 5-0 on a break-away goal set up by Zombo at 11:09 . Then , Steve Maltais broke Curtis Joseph 's shutout just 18 seconds later , making it 5-1 . Less than a minute after the North Stars ' final was announced , Tim Bergland scored and cut the lead to 5-2 . But Shanahan scored his 51st , converting a pass from Nelson Emerson with 21.3 seconds remaining in the second period . Then , it was all Lightning . Adam Creighton scored 40 seconds into the third period , prompting Berry to rest the overworked Joseph . Guy Hebert allowed goals to Shawn Chambers and Danton Cole in a span of 1:21 midway through the third period . The goals by Chambers and Cole made Shanahan 's second goal stand up as the winner . `` We were in there , '' Shanahan said . `` The game was over . We were in .

If I forgot or botched your favorite acronym , please let me know ! Also , if there 's an acronym *not* on this list that confuses you , drop me a line , and if I can figure it out , I 'll add it to the list . Note that this is intended to be a reference for *frequently seen* acronyms , and is most emphatically *not* encyclopedic . If I incorporated every acronym I ever saw , I 'd soon run out of disk space ! : - ) The list will be posted at regular intervals , every 30 days . All comments regarding it are welcome ; I 'm reachable as bradfrd2 @ ncar.ucar.edu . Note that this just tells what the acronyms stand for -- you 're on your own for figuring out what they *mean* ! Note also that the total number of acronyms in use far exceeds what I can list ; special-purpose acronyms that are essentially always explained as they 're introduced are omitted . Further , some acronyms stand for more than one thing ; as of Edition 3 of the list , these acronyms appear on multiple lines , unless they 're simply different ways of referring to the same thing . Thanks to everybody who 's sent suggestions since the first version of the list , and especially to Garrett A. Wollman ( wollman @ griffin.uvm.edu ) , who is maintaining an independent list , somewhat more verbose in character than mine , and to Daniel Fischer ( dfi @ specklec.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de ) , who is maintaining a truly HUGE list ( 535 at last count ) of acronyms and terms , mostly in German ( which I read , fortunately ) . Special thanks this time to Ken Hollis at NASA , who sent me a copy of NASA Reference Publication 1059 Revised : _Space Transportation System and Associated Payloads : Glossary , Acronyms , and Abbreviations_ , a truly mammoth tome -- almost 300 pages of TLAs . Special Bonus ! At the end of this posting , you will find a perl program written by none other than Larry Wall , whose purpose is to scramble the acronym list in an entertaining fashion .

He then constructs his religious beliefs around > this understanding , reading *other* scripture in the context of > these commandments , with `` love '' benignly understood . I regard love as no more or less `` benign '' than any other Christian does . You are merely expressing `` approval '' of the consequences I find therein . Which says more about our politics and cultural trappings than about my ( or any ) religion . `` Love '' is a highly ambiguous word , of which Christians can write both the `` gentle '' words Paul uses of it in 1 Corinthians -- in a passage that even the `` conservatives '' will quote at you : - ) -- and the words of T. S. Eliot in his Pentacost Hymn , `` Love is the unfamiliar Name that wove the intolerable shirt of flame ... '' This is in any case rather to the side of what I was attempting to raise in my note , as will become more evident below . > As a non-believer , I find Michael 's Christianity kinder and gentler . blechhh . I think you are misreading me , rather seriously . Though , given my principle that one CAN NOT force one 's own notion of `` sin '' on another , and my unshakeable `` disestablishmentarianism '' , Russel Turpin and others ( believers and unbelievers alike ) are under no threat of my legislating my own understanding of Christian love . > If I take him at > his word , he can not condemn the Inquisitors , because they were > also following these commandments as *they* understood them . If You misread . I can do ( and have repeatedly done ) a complete bill of accusation against the Inquisition by exhibiting in as thorough a form as anyone might want a demonstration of the harm it has done to human beings ( in the first place ) and to respect for ( let alone love of ) `` God '' in near succession . Please go back to my quoted words above : The `` possibility that always exists '' is that I ( or , to revert to proper time sequence , my predecessors over the last several centuries ) could persuade `` Christian B '' of my case that the Inquisition *does* indeed constitute an egregious violation of the Law of Love . I must also note that the majority of Christians HAVE been so persuaded . By Christian argumentation , as well as by secular [ both Christian and non-Christian ] prohibitions . What Mr. Turpin alludes to is a trickier point : A. I demonstrate the human pain and violation of love involved in the Inquisition . B . The Inquisitor responds that Mother Church must , however painful this *seems* , `` discipline '' her children for their own good -- in this case the salvation of their souls ( or if the tortured heretic will not recant , than by bad example `` deterring '' others from the same loss-of-soul . ) A. I point out that this `` justification '' of a failure in love depends on a highly speculative construal of texts and of philosophical assertions that are quite undemonstrable . B. Burns me at the stake . My rhetoric has failed , but the point I am making is sustained . What is going on here has a *lot* to do with `` cultural baggage . '' In this case , the baggage includes a ( nearly universal , and absolutely secular ) belief that an accused person must prove innocence and that testimony is most believable if taken under torture . The elimination of Inqisitorial practice ( in those places where it *has* been eliminated , or at least greatly reduced ) has very little , if anything , to do with the discussion of sin in the exchange between A and B. Mr. Turpin is pointing out that , if I am A versus the Grand Inquisitor 's B , then my persuasion is not very likely to work . I know this ; and in what- ever personal agony , I consign the issue to God and my ghostly defense attorney . So , `` one possibility '' fails in this case -- as it will fail in may others . At the other extreme , the `` persuasion '' will succeed when it properly SHOULD not , if it entails mistaken assumptions I share with the Inquisitor . And that is potentially an even more troubling case , in that many of the victims of Inquisition will have `` accepted '' that they were in fact sinful ( in such random cases as they may actually have been guilty of charges brought against them . ) The point is that the `` persuasion '' breaks down when the parties do NOT share enough to agree on all the cultural baggage -- and given the main thrust of the Inquisition , against `` heresy '' , it is *bound* to break down in precisely the `` worst '' cases . The `` conservative '' ( I do n't think that is the right word , BTW ) will take refuge in what I attribute to B above , that he is `` justified '' in causing harm because he *thinks* that works to a `` greater good . '' But this is a violent and extravagant REFUSAL to follow the gospel , as if one 's theories about `` sin '' entitled one to cast aside Jesus ' words on dealing with sinners ( cf . Matthew 5:39ff ) . I am a `` radical '' Christian *only* in that I take the gospel seriously . > ( Or , for that matter , what does it mean to love one 's fellow > man ? ) And what is the `` right thing '' ? And how does one go about > loving god ? Well , the whole *point* of making these the `` base '' commandments is that they *aren't* reducible to rules . A set of rules is a moral code or a law code or an algorithm for acting . Such things can be very helpful to individuals or societies -- but not if they are used *instead* of a personal involvement in and responsibility for one 's actions . The Great Commandment is , more than anything else , a call to act *as if you were God and accepting ultimate responsibility* in your every action . A demand that I , like most , would rather *not* hear , but it keeps popping up nonetheless ( along with the reassurance that it is more important that I be open to trying this , than succeeding at it ) . `` Conservatives '' may twist this `` act as if you were God '' to mean `` lay down rules for other people and be as nasty to them as possible if they do n't keep YOUR rules . '' They are so insistent ( and obvious ) about this that they have convinced a lot of people ( who rightly reject the whole concept ! ) that such idiocy IS how God acts . That , after all , is the standard accusation `` against God '' by the atheists here and elsewhere . That the `` conservatives '' have confused THEIR manipulative , hoop-jumping notions of coercing other people with the Nature of God is almost the entire content of standard American atheism -- and I quite agree with it on this point . > Ethical systems are not differentiated by the nice sounding goo > up front , much of which sounds pretty much the same , but by the > *specific* acts , procedures , and arguments that they recommend . And different bodies of Christians have , from the beginning , urged *different* `` ethical systems '' ( or in some cases , none ) . As a result , it is bizarre to identify any one of these systems , however popular ( or infamous ) with Christianity . Christianity DOES NOT HAVE A TORAH . It does not have a QU'RAN . Specifically Christian scripture has very little , if anything , in the way of `` commandments '' -- so little that the `` Christians '' who desperately *want* commandments go `` mining '' for them with almost no support ( and thus almost no obvious limitation : - ) ) for their efforts . The one , single , thing in the gospels which Jesus specifically `` gives '' as `` a commandment '' to us is `` love one another . '' [ I will be expanding on this point in a reply to Paul Hudson that I hope to get to in a day or so -- it is quite true that SOME Christians infer LOTS of commandments from the NT ; I'll point out what has to be going on in these inferences , and why there is a huge amount of `` cultural baggage '' involved . ] You are quite right that this is `` goo '' if one is looking for an ethical system . But why should anyone BE looking for an ethical system , since our society is eager to hand us one or more no matter what we do ? It may be that we need a principle for the CRITIQUE of ethical systems -- in which case I will profer the _agapate allelou_ once again . > I am glad that a few Christians , > such as Michael , find a benign meaning for the goo , and then > interpret the usually ugly specifics in a more constructive > fashion . On the other hand , I do think that this tells us more > about Michael and Christians like him that it tells us about > Christianity . I think you are begging the question . Why do n't I and the ( myriads of ) other Christians like me tell you something about Christianity ? [ Nor is this very new in Christianity -- you might want to look up the origins and fundamental doctrines of the Quakers , from the 17th century onwards , and they are not at all the first to understand the gospel in a manner that is congenial to my case . ] -- Michael L.

From : JEK @ cu.nih.gov Subject : etymology of `` Easter '' Lines : 53 for SRC In most languages , the Feast of the Resurrection of Our Lord is known as the PASCH , or PASQUE , or some variation thereof , a word which comes from the Hebrew PESACH , meaning `` Passover . '' In English , German , and a few related languages , however , it is known as EASTER , or some variation thereof , and questions have been asked about the origin of this term . One explanation is that given by the Venerable Bede in his DE RATIONE TEMPORUM 1:5 , where he derives the word from the name of an Anglo-Saxon goddess of Spring called EASTRE . Bede is a great scholar , and it is natural to take his word for it . But he lived 673-735 , and Augustine began preaching in Kent in 597 . The use of the word EASTER to describe the Feast would have been well established before the birth of Bede and probably before the birth of anyone he might have discussed the subject with . It seems likely that his derivation is just a guess , based on his awareness that there had been an Anglo-Saxon goddess of Spring bearing that name , and the resemblance of the words . Thus , if the said resemblance ( surely it is not surprising that a personification of Spring should have a name similar to the word for Dawn ) is not in istelf convincing , the testimony ( or rather the conjecture ) by Bede does not make it more so . Assuming that Bede was right , that would not justify saying that the Christian celebration ( which , after all , had been going on for some centuries before the name EASTER was applied to it ) has pagan roots . It would simply mean that the Anglo-Saxons , upon becoming Christians and beginning to celebrate the Resurrection by a festival every spring , called it by the name that to them meant simply `` Spring Festival . '' However , Bede 's is not the only theory that has been proposed . J Knoblech , in `` Die Sprach , '' ZEITSCHRIFT FUER SPRACHWISSENSCHAFT 5 ( Vienna , 1959 ) 27-45 , offers the following derivation : Among Latin-speaking Christians , the week beginning with the Feast of the Resurrection was known as `` hebdomada alba '' ( white week ) , since the newly-baptized Christians were accustomed to wear their white baptismal robes throughout that week . Sometimes the week was referred to simply as `` albae . '' Translaters rendering this into German mistook it for the plural of `` alba , '' meaning `` dawn . '' They accordingly rendered it as EOSTARUM , which is Old High German for '' dawn . '' This gave rise to the form EASTER in English . Yours , James Kiefer [ No , I 'm not interested in restarting discussions of the propriety of celebrating Easter . However this seems like it contains enough interesting information that people might like to see it . -- clh ]

I have recently become aware that my health insurance includes coverage for illness and injuries suffered by Christians . It disturbs me deeply to know that my premiums may be used to pay for that which I sincerely believe is divine punishment for their sinful conduct . In addition these folks are able to avail themselves of such alternative therapies as Lourdes , Fatima , Morris Cerullo , Benny Hinn , etc . In any case as `` Jesus Saves ' I feel that there is no reason for them to be covering their bets at my expense .

'' You read more into the medal than it is worth . The Woman is the Church . Catholics have always called our Church `` Holy Mother Church '' and our `` Mother . '' An example would be from St. Cyprian of Carthage , who wrote in 251 AD , `` Can anyone have God for his Father , who does not have the Church for his mother ? '' Hence the image of the Church as a woman , holding a Cross and a Cup , which tell of the Crucifxition of Our Lord , and of the power of His Blood ( the grail legend , but also , more significantly , it shows that '' This is the Cup of the New Covenant in my blood , which shall be shed for you and for many . '' ( Luke 22.20 ) , the Cup represents the New Covenant and holds the blood of redemption ) . The fact that the woman is holding both and is said to have the whole world for her seat , is that the Catholic Church is catholic , that is universal , and is found throughout the world , and the Church shows the Crucifixtion and applies the blood of redemption to all mankind by this spread of hers , thorugh which the Holy Sacrafice of the Mass , can be said and celebrated in all the nations as Malachi predicted in Malachi 1.11 , `` From the rising of the sun to its setting , my name is great among the gentiles , and everywhere there is sacrafice , and there is offered to my Name a clean oblation , for my Name is great among the gentiles , says the Lord of hosts . '' And so we acknowledge what St. Paul wrote `` For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup , you show the Lord 's death until he comes . '' ( 1 Corinthians 11.26 ) You are quite right about the identification of `` Babylon the Great , Mother of all Harlots '' with Rome . I think we simply disagree as to what time period of Rome the Apostle John is talking about . Andy Byler

How does one tell if a Second Coming is the real thing , unless the > person claiming to be IT is obviously insane ? First by his fruits . The messiah comes to build the kingdom of heaven on the earth . He also comes to first reveal the root cause of original sin ( fallen nature ) and then provide a means to cut the connection to that original sin . He also wants to create world peace based on Godism . The messiah 's teachings will build on the foundation of the Bible but provide profound new insights into the nature of God , the fall of man , the purpose of creation , and God 's providence of restoration . It will also provide a foundation for the unity of all the World 's religions . Many Christians expect Jesus to come on literal clouds , so they may miss him when he returns . Just as the Jewish people missed Jesus 2000 years ago . They are still waiting for his first coming . The Jewish people of that age expected Elijah to come first . Jesus said that John the Baptist was Elijah . But John the Baptist denied that he was Elijah . ( How did this reflect on Jesus ? ) Later in prison John even questioned who Jesus was : `` is he the one who is to come or do we look for another '' .

Very good point and perhaps the most important point of all for Christians : How to recognize the Second Coming ? The Messiah should not claim to be God . What sets a Messiah apart is that he is born without original sin . He is not born perfect but achieves perfection after a period of growth . Adam and Eve were born sinless but they fell , and this tragedy meant that it would take God thousands of years to create the kingdom of heaven on the earth as God originally intended . God 's restoration providence is still not complete . The messiah is the true Son of God , one with God , God's representative on the earth , but not God himself . There is only one God . > [ Mark 13:21 And then if any one says to you , 'Look , here is the Christ ! ' > or 'Look , there he is !

Sorry , Nelson , but you forgot to ask me . If you check the THN stats for Kansas City , you 'll find that Larry has been playing for the games , having played in 8 games in the period covered in the stats between 3/26 and the 4/16 issue ( 1-3-4 with 13 PIM ) .

Well , having gotten to a chance to talk to him a few times , this is n't quite accurate . He injured his back ( a disk injury ) and did one stupid thing , which was to hide it from the Sharks and he tried to play through it because he knew he was on the bubble . The Sharks then sent him to K.C. , at which point he disclosed the injury . Since he did n't disclose it , the Sharks and he disagreed about the responsibility and he was suspended for not reporting . That was eventually worked out , the Sharks re-instated him as injured and put him into therapy , and when he was able to play then shipped him down to K.C . He fully expects to play in the NHL again , although clearly not with the Sharks ( hiding injuries is a stupid no-no , beyond just a no-no ) . Very nice guy . Always hustled his butt off . He disappeared because he was hurt . I expect he 'll surface with another team at some point ( probably another expansion team ) , but is likely to be a bubble player for the rest of his career . Has a good work ethic and is good at getting other players motivated . Unfortunately , he played himself out of the Sharks future with a bad judgement call . > # 20 JOHN CARTER Season : 4th > Acquired : '91-92 , free agent from Boston > Grade : I ( B+/B ) > He > is very unlikely to be back next season . Always gave 110 % , best work ethic on the club ( except maybe Kisio ) , but hustle is n't always enough . His future with the Sharks was made clear to me one night against the Flames when he went behind the crease and tried to hold Joel Otto against the board . He literally had one arm around Otto's neck and another wrapped around Otto 's stick arm . Otto casually turned around and fed the puck in front of the crease for a goal , as though Carter was n't there . Hustle can only cover size so far . The Sharks have told me , point blank , that he 's gone for good ( ditto HUbie McDonough ) . He was one of the favorites of the staff , but as one said to me '' you have to make room for the kids '' . Carter , in fact , refused to report to K.C . and has been suspended by the Sharks . That might be a defacto retirement , but I have n't heard anything official . His only hope in hockey now is the Gulls . > # 28 JEAN-FRANCOIS QUINTIN Season : 1st > Acquired : '91-92 , from Minnesota in dispersal draft > Grade : I ( B+/B ) > I do n't understand why the Sharks did n't let Quintin play any more than the > 14 games he played this season .

The couple had been separated for a month and the woman had gone to his apartment to talk about getting some more money for food . A violent quarrel broke out and Prevost attacked his wife with a kitchen knife , cutting her throat , police said . She was only the latest of 13 women slain by a husband or lover in Quebec in the last five weeks . Five children have also been slain as a result of the same domestic `` battles . '' Last year in Quebec alone , 29 [ women ] were slain by their husbands . That was more than one-third of such cases across Canada , according to statistics from the Canadian Centre for Justice . [ rest of article ommited ] Then to say that women are somehow `` better '' or `` should '' be the one to `` stay home '' and raise a child is also laughable .

Experts on international terrorism assert that the Armenian terrorists use proceeds from drug trafficking ( and from the Armenian Foundation ) to fund their deadly enterprises . The deadliest of terrorist assassins , Carlos , proclaimed on Spanish television that his organization had entered into a working relationship with Armenian terrorists and they are using drug trafficking to raise money 'to continue ' to slaughter innocent people . Now , what is your personal and organizational role in this scheme ?

Science Lines : 37 Distribution : usa NNTP-Posting-Host : tomato.cis.ohio-state.edu Hi all , I 'm an assistant manager at a local art theater here in Columbus . I'd like to expand our show automation a bit- namely add the capability to use cue tapes to bring the houselights up . Our current automation consoles date from the early 60 's and do n't provide this function . We already have the combo failsafe/contact rollers to read the cuetapes , and our dimmer system will raise the houselights when its fade-up control circuit ( 120 VAC ) is momentarily closed , for at least 0.5 second . I 've tried wiring the dimmer control to a 12V relay , activated when the cue tape completes the circuit . Low tech and simple , but there 's one problem : In order to get the 1/2 second pulse , there needs to be a sh**load of cuetape on the film . ( 35mm runs at 90 feet per minute , so to get a 1/2 second pulse , there needs to be at least 9 inches of solid cuetape ! ) Ideally , I would like to use a single cross-cue to accomplish this function . ( A single strip of cuetape perpendicular to the length of the film ) This would give a pulse of approximately 1/100 of a second . What I need is a circuit to detect the short cue and activate the relay for around 1/2 second . The ability to adjust how long the relay is activated would be nice . I figure this would require an RC circuit of some sort . I 'm sure some of you already have the solution figured out in your heads . Any suggestions and schematics would be appreciated !

From what I 've heard ( pure hearsay ) the results of outputting TT fonts as Type 1 is _not_ as good as using high-quality Type 1 fonts in the first place . Unless you ` print ' to file with the correct resolution set for the final output device ( image setter ) . A problem with TT fonts in Windows is that they do get converted to T1 format OK , and the hinting is even used while this is done , but the resulting T1 fonts are NOT hinted . The result is that they WILL work fine on a device of the resolution assumed by the printer driver when the PS file is generated , but they will not look good when printed at a different resolution . So when you print to an attached PS printer , with the PS driver set up for this printer results , may be quite good . But if you take a PS file made for that printer and run it on a device of different resolution ( such as an image setter ) , then the results may not be so good .

EDT THE PRESIDENT : Thank you very much . The speech that Octavius gave says more than anything I will be able to say today about why it 's important to give all of our young people a chance to get a work experience and to continue to learn , to merge the nature of learning and work ; why it 's important to honor the efforts of people like Jerry Levin and Nancye Combs and Pat Irving and all of those who are here . I want to thank the Secretaries of Labor and Education and all the people who work with them for sponsoring this ; and my good friend , Governor Wilder , for being here and for speaking ; and all of the business and local community leaders from the city and county and state level from around America who are here . This has been a pretty fun day . ( Laughter . ) I loved hearing the young people sing . It was music to my ears because it is their future that we are really struggling about . ( Applause . ) A year and a half ago I began the quest to seek the presidency because I was concerned about their future . Because I believe that our country , which had always been a beacon of hope for the young , had too little opportunity , was too divided among ourselves across lines of income and race and region and other ways , without a vision to take us into the future . I entered with the hope that together we could create more opportunity and insist on much more responsibility from all of our people . But in the process we might recreate the best of America 's community , knowing that together we could always to more than we could individually and that we might secure our future . All of you here today are committed to that . The 1,000 jobs that Jerry Levin has committed Time-Warner to is symbolic of the commitments made by many of the private sector people who are here , and those who are around the country . The work that Nancye Combs does , and the successes of all the young people like those on this stage , and especially the eloquent statement Octavius Jeffers -- all those things show that together we know what we need to do , and we 're on the right track . Last July when I was traveling across America 's heartland in my luxurious bus , I visited Seneca High School in Louisville , Kentucky . And there I met young people and business people who were participating in the Louisville Education and Employment Partnership . I saw what Nancye Combs talked about today . I saw how the young people were making an extra effort to succeed both in school and at work . I saw , as I have seen many times in my own state , the principle illustrated that Octavius has talked about -- that for millions of American young people it is really an impediment to both their learning and their ability to be good workers to draw a sharp dividing line between what is work and what is learning . In the world in which we are living , the average young person will change the nature of work seven or eight times in a lifetime . We must learn to merge the work world and the learning world much better . And we must determine that all of our young people see the opportunities that some of them have had showcased here today . Whether you 're in business or in government or in education , you know that we have a big job to do when it comes to building a future that really , honestly includes opportunity for all of our people . There are still a lot of people who say , well , things are pretty good here in Washington and everything 's fine ; the best thing we can do about this whole thing is nothing . They all have jobs . ( Laughter . ) All the people who say that . ( Applause . ) They all have health insurance . They all have a pretty good education . And they all have a pretty secure knowledge that they 'll be okay no matter what happens . I say that not to be either political or unduly critical , but to point out that one of the great challenges of this age for every advanced nation -- everyone -- is to fully develop the capacities of all of its people , and then find work for them to do . All the European countries have higher unemployment rates than we do , but also stronger support systems for the unemployed . The Japanese unemployment rate has been going up . They 're going to adopt a stimulus that , even if you count it in its most rigorous terms , is three or four times bigger than the one that I have proposed to create jobs . In West Germany alone , the unemployment rate is now about as high as ours . This is a big problem for advanced nations . It costs a lot of money to add an extra employee , with a lot of pressure from low-wage producers in other countries that are growing their own economies and trying to provide new opportunity for their people . But it is especially important for America for two reasons : One is , we have a whole lot of folks who , unless we move aggressively , will not have the education and skills we need to be competitive and productive in a nation like this . The second is , even if we educate them all , if there are n't jobs they will be robbed of the fruits of their educational labors . People need to be able to work in this country . ( Applause . ) We have always had some unemployment ; and , indeed , some of it is normal . You 've always got some people leaving jobs and moving around the country and doing first one thing and another . We have now , at this moment in our history , the necessity for all big organizations , including the government , to reexamine the way they are organized and who ask whether there are too many people working at some kinds of jobs . But in the whole , we must still be able to create jobs in a country like America , to provide people with the chance to work . It 's going to be difficult for me to make the welfare reform proposals that I will make to Congress in the next couple of months -- it 's going to be hard for me to make those work if , at the end of all this work , to get off welfare there is n't a job . ( Applause . ) So we have two tasks . One is to develop the capacity of the American people to perform without regard to race or income or the circumstances of their birth . The other is to make sure that there are some opportunities for them to bring to bear for their talent and to be rewarded with a paycheck . It is a great challenge . I do not pretend that all of the answers are simple . But I know if you want to ask the American people , all of them , to be more responsible , if you want to recreate a sense of community in this country that bridges the lines of race and income and region , you have got to have opportunity in that mix . A part of our vision for America has to be a future for every young person in this country who 's willing to play by the rules and work hard and strive for the end of the rainbow . There has to be something at the end of that rainbow . And that is what we are basically here to talk about today : What can we all do as partners , recognizing none of us can do it alone , to develop the capacities of our people to succeed wherever they live and whatever their background . And then , what can we do to make sure that there 's something there for them to do ? The summer jobs program we 're discussing today is an integral part of that plan , because it will promote the values of work and opportunity and fairness , community . It will put the people first , and it does have a partnership between the public and private sector . I said when I addressed the United States Congress in February on this program that I would seek to create about 700,000 extra summer jobs from government sources and then challenge the American business community to meet that target so that we can create more than a million new summer jobs over and above what had been created before . Many , many people have responded to that challenge . And Jerry is just a shining example of that which has been replicated in this room and around the country -- people who are going to do more than they otherwise would in the private sector to give young people a work experience . And it is terribly important . I want to emphasize that this summer jobs program is part of an overall commitment to increase the capacity of the American people -- from retraining defense workers who lose their jobs and other adults who need to acquire new skills ; to improving the transition from school to work for young people who do n't go to college but do need at least two years of post-high school training either on the job or in a community college or a vocational setting , so that they can be competitive workers , making it possible for more people to go on to college who do want to go . All these things are part and parcel of a comprehensive plan . It 's also important , as I said , that we create more jobs . The emergency jobs program that I asked the Congress to adopt would create a half a million extra jobs over the next year and a half , and that would reduce the unemployment rate by a half a percent . It would also enable us to absorb more young people coming into the work force in jobs that otherwise will not be created . It also will help a lot of cities and counties to invest in things that need to be done at the grass-roots level -- projects long delayed , water projects , sewer projects , park projects , new industries and particularly in small and medium-size communities -- a whole range of things that will improve the economy and improve the environment . The summer jobs program is an important part of that because we have tried for the first time , through the work of the Labor Department and the Education Department and through reaching out to people like you , to make this more than just a one-shot summer jobs program ; to integrate it with private sector efforts ; to hopefully replicate it in each coming summer ; to move these young people into further educational opportunities and to further job opportunities ; and to have a strong , meaningful education component to these summer jobs -- something that the United States government has never fully emphasized before . A lot of these young people , as you well know , because they come from difficult backgrounds , because they go to school in difficult and challenging circumstances , need extra help in building their basic skills in math and language , reasoning and in other areas . And a lot of educational studies show that young people who have difficulty in school often forget as much as 30 percent of what they learn over the summer and then that has to be repeated the next year . What we are trying to do here is to give people the opportunity to learn good work habits and to reinforce their learning skills and to put them together ; and then , hopefully , over the next couple of years , if our entire program passes , to give every school in this country the opportunity to have a good work and learning environment . There will be more applied academics , more opportunities for people to learn and work during the school year , so that this will not simply be an isolated moment for these young folks , but will be a part of building a whole new educational experience , a whole new work experience , and moving on a pathway to a better future . The summer jobs programs are not designed to be make- work jobs . They 're designed to make a future for the people holding the job . And that 's what they will do . In the process , they 'll help to build local communities , to strengthen local economies , to solve local problems . Real jobs -- renovating housing , repairing public buildings , doing clerical work , providing nursing assistance in hospitals , supervising and training children at child care centers , and learning all the way . Challenging young people to learn while they earn , but letting them earn . You know , it 's very difficult to make a case to people who have never seen opportunity on their own street that they should do this , that , or the other thing if there 's no evidence of the opportunity that 's at the end of the effort . I have not been sparing in going for the last year-and-a-half into places where it is n't exactly popular to say it , and say I wanted to reform the welfare system ; I wanted to toughen child support ; I wanted to require people to work ; I was sick and tired of people being irresponsible in the use of guns on the streets , and I wanted to change all that . But if you 're going to summon people to greater responsibility , you have to reward them when they do the right thing with opportunity . ( Applause . ) The young people we propose to put to work under our program will spend 90 hours learning basic skills , such as math , reading , writing -- either on the job in the classroom . They will stretch their minds as well as work up a sweat . They will have a sense of accomplishment . It will literally be a summer challenge , but a challenge that will take them into a different life . So I want to ask all of you to support this effort even as I , as your President , support your effort . At the end of the summer we will evaluate all the young people who participate . We 'll see whether they , instead of falling behind over the summer academically as too many young people do , they stayed even or moved ahead . I suspect that they will . This summer , Secretary Reich and Secretary Riley and I will be visiting many of your communities . We 'll really try to learn from you which of these efforts are working , what we should do next summer , how we can build it in to what goes on during the school year , how we can build in our job training efforts and the works that we do with your companies to make sense of this whole thing -- so that we maximize the impact of the taxpayer dollar and your private investments as well . We want to honor the companies and the communities , the business leaders and the young people who do the very best jobs this summer . And , again , I want to say to all of you in private business who have matched our effort , I thank you . And to all of you who have n't , and those across the country who may listen or learn about this event today , I want to implore other private employers to stretch a little bit to give other young people a chance to work this summer . I 'm telling you , we can not go through another 10 years when we do n't give these children anything to say yes to . If we exhort them to do right , we 've got to be able to reward them . ( Applause . ) When the other speakers were talking , I was sitting up here on the platform , listening and reveling . And they got talking about work , and I got to thinking about all the different things I 've done to make a living in my life . When I was 13 , I made a very foolish short-term business investment : I set up a comic book stand and sold two trunks full of comic books . Made more money than I had ever had in my life . But if I had saved those trunks , they 'd be worth $ 100,000 today . ( Laughter . ) That does not mean young people should not be entrepreneurial . It just means that you ca n't foresee a generation ahead . I have mowed yards and cleared land and built houses and worked in body shops and the parts departments of a car dealership . And I 've done a lot of different things for a living . Some people say I got into politics to escape work . ( Laughter . ) I learned something from every job I ever had . But I grew up in a generation where I literally did not know a living soul without regard to race or income who wanted to work who did n't have a job . I grew up in a generation when all you had to really say to people is , get an education and you 'll be all right . You 'll get a job and you 'll make more money next year than you did this year . Now I live in a generation full of people , most of whom do n't make any more money in real dollars than they did 10 years ago and they 're working longer hours and they 're paying more for the basics of life . And we are now wondering whether we can create the jobs that these young people want . Now , I want to close by reemphasizing these two things : It does n't matter what kind of economic policies this administration pursues , or how much productivity increases there are in the private sector , if young Americans do n't get a good education , do n't learn how to work and ca n't be productive , those jobs will not be created in this country . Machines will do the work or the work will be done off-shore by people who have the same skill levels and can work for a third or a fourth or a fifth the wages . So nothing we can do economically will matter unless we build the skills and capacities of America 's work force . And anybody that pretends otherwise is just kidding . On the other hand , we need to be honest . Every wealthy country in the world , including the United States , is having difficulty creating jobs . If I knew everything that needs to be done I 'd be glad to tell you and we could just call off the whole deliberations of Congress and everything else . I do n't have all the answers . But I know this : Doing nothing is not the answer . ( Applause . ) And so the jobs program that I have presented to Congress , with the summer jobs , with the money for the cities and the counties , through the Community Development Program , with the infrastructure money , is a small part of a big budget . It is an attempt to engage in an experiment to see whether or not , with the economy recovering in terms of corporate profit , we can give a little boost to it , give opportunities to young people , create a half a million jobs and maybe get the engine going again . Most of the jobs in this program are going to be jobs in the private sector , not government jobs , even though it 's government money . And the lion 's share of the work in rebuilding the American economy obviously will come from the private sector . That 's the kind of system we have and it works pretty well . But this is the challenge we have . So I ask all of you here today to support the summer jobs program , to ask your friends and neighbors to support it , to go back home and ask your employers to make a little extra effort ; to do what you can to help me pass the funds to create the 700,000 jobs that the United States government should create this summer , so that together we can have this partnership . Because more than anything else , we have to give a future -- a future that our young people can believe in . We need to send them a message that here in America if you study hard and work hard , if you obey the law and contribute something to your community , you will be rewarded by your country . You can build a future from you own dreams . That has always been the promise of America . Together that 's what this summer of challenge needs to be : a reaffirmation of the promise of America for so many young people to whom that promise has been an illusion . We can make it a reality . Thank you very much . ( Applause . ) END11:45 A.M. EDT

I was wondering if anyone can shed any light on just how it is that these electronic odometers remember the total elapsed mileage ? What kind of memory is stable/reliable enough , non-volatile enough and independent enough ( of outside battery power ) to last say , 10 years or more , in the life of a vehicle ? I 'm amazed that anything like this could be expected to work for this length of time ( especially in light of all the gizmos I work with that are doing good to work for 2 months without breaking down somehow ) . Side question : how about the legal ramifications of selling a used car with a replaced odometer that starts over at 0 miles , after say 100/200/300K actual miles . Looks like fraud would be fairly easy - for the price of a new odometer , you can say it has however many miles you want to tell the buyer it has . Thanks for any insight .

Contents : * In mathematical terms , what is a private-key cryptosystem ? * What is an attack ? * What 's the advantage of formulating all this mathematically ? * Why is the one-time pad secure ? * What 's a ciphertext-only attack ? * What 's a known-plaintext attack ? * What 's a chosen-plaintext attack ? * In mathematical terms , what can you say about brute-force attacks ? * What 's a key-guessing attack ? What 's entropy ? * In mathematical terms , what is a private-key cryptosystem ? A private-key cryptosystem consists of an encryption system E and a decryption system D. The encryption system E is a collection of functions E_K , indexed by `` keys '' K , mapping some set of `` plaintexts '' P to some set of `` ciphertexts '' C. Similarly the decryption system D is a collection of functions D_K such that D_K ( E_K ( P ) ) = P for every plaintext P. That is , succesful decryption of ciphertext into plaintext is accomplished using the same key ( index ) as was used for the corresponding encryption of plaintext into ciphertext . Such systems , wherein the same key value is used to encrypt and decrypt , are also known as `` symmetric '' cryptoystems . * What is an attack ? In intuitive terms a ( passive ) attack on a cryptosystem is any method of starting with some information about plaintexts and their corresponding ciphertexts under some ( unknown ) key , and figuring out more information about the plaintexts . It 's possible to state mathematically what this means . Here we go . Fix functions F , G , and H of n variables . Fix an encryption system E , and fix a distribution of plaintexts and keys . An attack on E using G assuming F giving H with probability p is an algorithm A with a pair f , g of inputs and one output h , such that there is probability p of computing h = H ( P_1 , ... , P_n ) , if we have f = F ( P_1 , ... , P_n ) and g = G ( E_K ( P_1 ) , ... , E_K ( P_n ) ) . Note that this probability depends on the distribution of the vector ( K , P_1 , ... , P_n ) . The attack is trivial ( or `` pointless '' ) if there is probability at least p of computing h = H ( P_1 , ... , P_n ) if f = F ( P_1 , ... , P_n ) and g = G ( C_1 , ... , C_n ) . Here C_1 , ... , C_n range uniformly over the possible ciphertexts , and have no particular relation to P_1 , ... , P_n . In other words , an attack is trivial if it does n't actually use the encryptions E_K ( P_1 ) , ... , E_K ( P_n ) . An attack is called `` one-ciphertext '' if n = 1 , `` two-ciphertext '' if n = 2 , and so on . * What 's the advantage of formulating all this mathematically ? In basic cryptology you can never prove that a cryptosystem is secure . Read part 3 : we keep saying `` a strong cryptosystem must have this property , but having this property is no guarantee that a cryptosystem is strong ! '' In contrast , the purpose of mathematical cryptology is to precisely formulate and , if possible , prove the statement that a cryptosystem is strong . We say , for example , that a cryptosystem is secure against all ( passive ) attacks if any nontrivial attack against the system ( as defined above ) is too slow to be practical . If we can prove this statement then we have confidence that our cryptosystem will resist any ( passive ) cryptanalytic technique . If we can reduce this statement to some well-known unsolved problem then we still have confidence that the cryptosystem is n't easy to break . Other parts of cryptology are also amenable to mathematical definition . Again the point is to explicitly identify what assumptions we 're making and prove that they produce the desired results . We can figure out what it means for a particular cryptosystem to be used properly : it just means that the assumptions are valid . The same methodology is useful for cryptanalysis too . The cryptanalyst can take advantage of incorrect assumptions . Often he can try to construct a proof of security for a system , see where the proof fails , and use these failures as the starting points for his analysis . * Why is the one-time pad secure ? By definition , the one-time pad is a cryptosystem where the plaintexts , ciphertexts , and keys are all strings ( say byte strings ) of some length m , and E_K ( P ) is just the sum ( let 's say the exclusive or ) of K and P. It is easy to prove mathematically that there are _no_ nontrivial single-ciphertext attacks on the one-time pad , assuming a uniform distribution of keys . Note that we do n't have to assume a uniform distribution of plaintexts . ( Here 's the proof : Let A be an attack , i.e. , an algorithm taking two inputs f , g and producing one output h , with some probability p that h = H ( P ) whenever f = F ( P ) and g = G ( E_K ( P ) ) ( i.e. , g = G ( K + P ) ) . Then , because the distribution of K is uniform and independent of P , the distribution of K + P must also be uniform and independent of P. But also the distribution of C is uniform and independent of P. Hence there is probability exactly p that h = H ( P ) whenever f = F ( P ) and g = G ( C ) , over all P and C. Thus a fortiori A is trivial . ) On the other hand the one-time pad is _not_ secure if a key K is used for more than one plaintext : i.e. , there are nontrivial multiple-ciphertext attacks . So to be properly used a key K must be thrown away after one encryption . The key is also called a `` pad '' ; this explains the name `` one-time pad . '' * What 's a ciphertext-only attack ? In the notation above , a ciphertext-only attack is one where F is constant . Given only some information G ( E_K ( P_1 ) , ... , E_K ( P_n ) ) about n ciphertexts , the attack has to have some chance of producing some information H ( P_1 , ... , P_n ) about the plaintexts . The attack is trivial if it has just as good a chance of producing H ( P_1 , ... , P_n ) when given G ( C_1 , ... , C_n ) for random C_1 , ... , C_n . For example , say G ( C ) = C , and say H ( P ) is the first bit of P. We can easily write down an attack -- -the `` guessing attack , '' which simply guesses that H ( P ) is 1 . This attack is trivial because it does n't use the ciphertext : it has a fifty-fifty chance of guessing correctly no matter what . On the other hand there is an attack on RSA which produces one bit of information about P , with 100 % success , using C. If it is fed a random C then the success rate drops to 50 % . So this is a nontrivial attack . * What 's a known-plaintext attack ? The classic known-plaintext attack has F ( P_1 , P_2 ) = P_1 , G ( C_1 , C_2 ) = ( C_1 , C_2 ) , and H ( P_1 , P_2 ) depending only on P_2 . In other words , given two ciphertexts C_1 and C_2 and one decryption P_1 , the known-plaintext attack should produce information about the other decryption P_2 . Note that known-plaintext attacks are often defined in the literature as producing information about the key , but this is pointless : the cryptanalyst generally cares about the key only insofar as it lets him decrypt further messages . * What 's a chosen-plaintext attack ? A chosen-plaintext attack is the first of an increasingly impractical series of _active_ attacks on a cryptosystem : attacks where the cryptanalyst feeds data to the encryptor . These attacks do n't fit into our model of passive attacks explained above . Anyway , a chosen-plaintext attack lets the cryptanalyst choose a plaintext and look at the corresponding ciphertext , then repeat until he has figured out how to decrypt any message . More absurd examples of this sort of attack are the `` chosen-key attack '' and `` chosen-system attack . '' A much more important form of active attack is a message corruption attack , where the attacker tries to change the ciphertext in such a way as to make a useful change in the plaintext . There are many easy ways to throw kinks into all of these attacks : for instance , automatically encrypting any plaintext P as T , E_K ( h ( T+R+P ) , R , P ) , where T is a time-key ( sequence number ) chosen anew for each message , R is a random number , and h is a one-way hash function . Here comma means concatenation and plus means exclusive-or . * In mathematical terms , what can you say about brute-force attacks ? Consider the following known-plaintext attack . We are given some plaintexts P_1 , ... , P_ { n-1 } and ciphertexts C_1 , ... , C_ { n-1 } . We're also given a ciphertext C_n . We run through every key K. When we find K such that E_K ( P_i ) = C_i for every i < n , we print D_K ( C_n ) . If n is big enough that only one key works , this attack will succeed on valid inputs all the time , while it will produce correct results only once in a blue moon for random inputs . Thus this is a nontrivial attack . Its only problem is that it is very slow if there are many possible keys . * What 's a key-guessing attack ? What 's entropy ? Say somebody is using the one-time pad -- -but is n't choosing keys randomly and uniformly from all m-bit messages , as he was supposed to for our security proof . In fact say he 's known to prefer keys which are English words . Then a cryptanalyst can run through all English words as possible keys . This attack will often succeed , and it 's much faster than a brute-force search of the entire keyspace . We can measure how bad a key distribution is by calculating its entropy . This number E is the number of `` real bits of information '' of the key : a cryptanalyst will typically happen across the key within 2^E guesses . E is defined as the sum of -p_K log_2 p_K , where p_K is the probability of key K .

The result was a well-conserved , 400 or so bp , sequence But why do you characterize this as a `` flight of fancy '' or a `` fantasy '' ? While I am unfamiliar with the scientific context here , it appears obvious that his speculation ( for lack of a better or more neutral word ) was at least in significant part a consequence of his knowledge of and acceptance of current theory coupled with his observations . It would appear that something quite rational was going on as he attempted to fit his observation into that theory ( or to tailor the theory to cover the observation ) .

Well , I think someone else in this thread was the first to use the word ( also , '' extra-scientific '' , etc. ) . Nor am I prepared to give a general account of rationality . In terms of examples , there is some danger of beginning to quibble over what a `` surprising '' experiment is , what counts as `` surprising '' , etc . The same may be said about `` logical grounds '' . My point is that quite frequently ( perhaps even most frequently ) the roots of a new theory can be traced to previously existing theories ( or even to previously rejected hypotheses of some other theory or domain ) . I would offer some rather well known examples such as Toricelli 's Puy de Dome experiment done for the sake of his `` sea of air '' hypothesis . Was this theory ( and the resulting experimental test ) `` surprising '' ? Well , given the *prior* explanations of the phenomena involved it certainly must be counted as so . Was the theory constructed ( and the experiment designed ) out of `` perfectly rational grounds '' ? Well , there was a pretty successful and well know theory of fluids . The analogy to fluids by Toricelli is explicit . The novelty was in thinking of air as a fluid ( but this was *quite* a novelty at the time ) . Was the theory interesting ? Yes . Was it `` new '' ? Well , one could argue that it was merely the extension of an existing theory to a new domain , but I think this begs certain questions . We can debate that if you like . -- Gary H.

And we're > thinking that this will work with high school kids ? ! ? I am told that Planned Parenthood/SIECUS-style `` values-free '' methods , that teach contraceptive technology and advise kids how to make `` choices '' , actually _increase_ pregnancy rates . I posted a long article on this a while back and will be happy to email a copy to any who are interested . The article included sources to contact for information on research verifying these statements , and an outstanding source for info on acquiring abstinence-related curricula even in single-copy quantities for home use . The same research produced the results that abstinence-related curricula were found to _decrease_ pregnancy rates in teens . I assume that it is reasonable to assume that the AIDS rate will fluctuate with the pregnancy rate . The difference is not in `` contraceptive technology '' but in the values taught to the children . The PP/SIECUS curricula taught the kids that they have legitimate choices , while the abstinence related curricula taught them that they did _not_ have _legitimate_ choices other than abstinence . It is the values system that is the strongest determinent of the behavior behavior of these kids . Despite the better track record of abstinence-related curricula , they are suppressed in favor of curricula that produce an effect contrary to that desired . Question for further discussion ( as they say in the textbooks ) : Why don't we teach `` safe drug use '' to kids , instead of drug abstinence ? Is n't it because we know that a class in `` how to use drugs safely if you _choose_ to use drugs '' would increase drug use ? Why is n't `` drug abstinence education '' barred from schools because it teaches `` religion '' ? Are n't we abandoning those children who will use drugs anyway , and need instruction in their safe use ? -- Joe Kellett jkellett @ netcom.com

howland.reston.ans.net ! europa.eng.gtefsd.com ! fs7.ece.cmu.edu ! news.sei.cmu.edu ! dpw Subject : Periodic Post of Charley Challenges , # 3 , with additions From : dpw @ sei.cmu.edu ( David Wood ) Organization : Software Engineering Institute Lines : 250 New in this version : challenge # 5 , plus an addendum summarizing Charley 's responses to-date.. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - *** This is a posting made periodically in an attempt to encourage *** Charley Wingate to address direct challenges to his evidently *** specious claims . I 'll continue to re-post periodically until *** he answers them , publicly indicates that he wo n't answer them , *** stops posting to alt.atheism , the alt.atheism community tells *** me to stop , or I get totally bored . I apologize for the *** somewhat juvenile nature of this approach , but I 'm at a loss *** to figure out another way to crack his intransigence and *** seeming intellectual dishonesty . *** *** This is re-post # 3 . Charley , I ca n't help but notice that you have still failed to provide answers to substantive questions that have been raised in response to your previous posts . I submit that you do n't answer them because you can not answer them without running afoul of your own logic , and I once again challenge you to prove me wrong . To make the task as easy for you as possible , I 'll present concise re-statements of some of the questions that you have failed to answer , in the hope that you may address them one at a time for all to see . Should you fail to answer again within a reasonable time period , I will re-post this article , with suitable additions and deletions , at such time that I notice a post by you on another topic . I will repeat this procedure until you either address the outstanding challenges or you cease to post to this newsgroup . I would like to apologize in advance if you have answered any of these questions previously and your answer missed my notice . If you can be kind enough to re-post or e-mail such articles , I will be only too pleased to publicly rescind the challenge in question , and remove it from this list . Now , to the questions ... 1 . After claiming that all atheists fit into neat psychological patterns that you proposed , then semi-retracting that claim by stating that you were n't referring to *all* atheists , I asked you to name some atheists who you feel do n't fit your patterns , to show that you indeed were not referring to all atheists that you are aware of . You failed to do so . Please do so now . Question : Can you name any a.a posters who do not fit into your stereotype ? Here is the context for the question : > > > This is not true for everyone on this board , and you are out of line > > > in assuming that it is . > > > > YOU , however , deleted the text further along where I said that I did n't mean > > to imply that everybody 's experience was along the same lines . > > Whether or not you *mean* to make such implications , you do so > repeatedly . > > Allow me to approach the issue from another viewpoint : can you name > those atheists that you 've come across who *do not* fit into the > patterns that you theorize ? 2 . You have taken umbrage to statements to the effect that `` senses and reason are all we have to go by '' , and when pressed , you have implied that we have an alternative called revelation . I have repeatedly asked you to explain what revelation is and how one can both experience and interpret revelation without doing so via our senses and reason . You failed to do so . Please do so now . Question : Can you explain what is revelation and how one can experience and interpret it without using senses and inherent reasoning ? Here is the context for the question : > > Revelation is not reason , and if we DO have revelation , then > > reasoning is NOT all we have . > First , show me that revelation exists . Second , if revelation is not > perceived through the senses , how exactly is it perceived ? According > to my Webster 's , revelation is `` an act of revealing or communicating > divine truth .

You have answered none of > these questions that go straight to the heart of your claims . If you > ca n't answer them , your claims are entirely specious . 3 . You have stated that all claims to dispassionate analysis made by a.a posters are unverifiable and fantastical . I asked you to identify one such claim that I have made . You have failed to do so . Please do so now . Question : Have I made any claims at all that are unverifiable and fantastical ? If so , please repeat them . Here is the context for the question : > > I must thank David Wood a most sensitive and intelligent ( if wrong : - ) ) > > posting . then later ... > > Likewise , the reference to `` unverifiable , fantastical > > claims '' represents fairly accurately my reaction to all of the claims to > > dispassionate analysis that are repeated in this group . > > Give me your address and I 'll be pleased to send you a dictionary . > Failing that , can you name ONE claim that I have made that is in any > sense unverifiable or fantastical ? I demand that you retract this > statement if you can not offer up evidence . If you follow your usual > pattern of ignoring the challenge , then you are simply an asshole . 4 . First you dismissed claims by atheists that they became atheists as a result of reason , then later you stated that if one accepted the '' axioms '' of reason that one could n't help but become atheist . I asked you to explain the contradiction . Your only response was a statement that the question was incoherent , an opinion not shared by others that I have asked , be they atheist or theist . You have failed to answer the question . Please do so now . Question : Do you retract your claim that a.a posters have not become atheists as a result of reason , despite their testimony to that effect ? If you do n't retract that claim , do you retract the subsequent claim that acceptance of the axioms of reason inevitably result in atheism ? Here is the context for the question : [ First quote ] > > ... we have here a bunch of people who claim that their position is > > based on reason ... it is up to atheists to prove it to me ... > > then , > [ Second quote ] > > ... but I do not see how one can accept these axioms and not end up with > > an atheistic point of view . 5 . First , you claimed that you would ( probably ) not answer these Challenges because they contained too much in the way of `` included text '' from previous posts . Later , you implied that you wouldn't respond because I was putting words in your mouth . Please clarify this seeming contradiction . Question : Do you prefer to respond to Challenges that include context from your own posts , or that I paraphrase your positions in order to avoid `` included text '' ? Here is the context for the question : First you said : > > My ordinary rules are that I do n't read articles over over 150 lines > > or articles in which there is nothing but included text on the first > > screen . THese are not rules of morality , but practicality . then later ... > > If someone is not going to argue with MY version of MY position , then > > they can not be argued with .

And I maintain : Some people do not want to enter into the light and the knowledge that they alone are their own masters , because they fear it ; they are too afraid of having to face the world on their own terms . And so , by their own choice , they will remain in darkness , sort of like bugs under a rock . However , some people , but not many , will not like the darkness . Sometimes it gets too cold and too dark to be comfortable . These people will crawl out from under the rock , and , although blinded at first , will get accustomed to the light and enjoy its warmth . And , after a while , now that they can see things for what they really are , they will also see the heights which they can reach , and the places they can go , and they will learn to choose their own paths through the world , and they will learn from their mistakes and revel in their successes . They will see that there is much much more to the world than just the narrow experiences under the rock . They will discover that life under a rock was incredibly yucky , and that life on their own terms is great -- so great that they will want to tell everyone else about it . Do you see my point ? I think you 're the one under the rock , and I'm getting a great tan out here in the sunlight . My life has improved immesurably since I abandoned theism -- come and join me !

Look , you just practically equated Odin and Zeus ? They 're as much different as your god is from them ... Do n't you see ? I 'm not going to accept ANYTHING that I ca n't witness with my own eyes or experience with my own senses , especially not something as mega-powerful as what you 're trying to get me to accept . Surely if you believe in it this strongly , you must have a good *reason* to , do n't you ? > Withough checking his own > presumption , he thinks hell is the equivalent of non-existence . When did I say that ? I say that I would rather CEASE EXISTING instead of being subject to the whims of a deity , but that if the deity decided to toss me into the fiery pits because of who I am , then so be it . > Do you enjoy darkness ? Most people will honestly admit `` yes '' . Most people > are fond of their sexual sins , their hording of money , their > selfishness , and not to mention , their Biblical ignorance . Nope -- most people are Christian . Most people are fond of feeling that they are imperfect , of believing that the world is an undesirable place , of reciting magical mystical prayers to make the world nice and holy again , of doing just as their priests tell them , like good little sheep . You enjoy darkness , and you 're proud of it . You may know the Bible well -- but have you read any of the Koran ? Or Zen writings ? Or Hare Krishna literature ? If you have n't , then how can you say you have an open mind ? > Sin is fun ! Let's > admit it . But a life of sin leads to trouble and death in this > life , and hell in the next . Nope .

'' I 'm sorry , I do n't feel that sacrificing Jesus was something any god I 'd worship would do , unless the sacrifice was only temporary , in which case it 's not really all that important .

Lambrou ) writes : > What about Cyprus ? ? The majority of the population is christian , but > your fellow Turkish friends DID and STILL DOING a 'good ' job for you > by cleaning the area from christians . All your article reflects is your abundant ignorance . The people of Turkiye know quite well that Greece and the Greek Cypriots will never abandon the idea of hellenizing Cyprus and will remain eternally hopeful of uniting it with Greece , someday , whatever the cost to the parties involved . The history speaks for itself . Greece was the sole perpetrator of invasion on that island when it sent its troops on July 15 , 1974 in an attempt to topple the legitimate government of Archibishop Makarios . Following the Greek Cypriot attempt to annex the island to Greece with the aid of the Greek army , Turkiye intervened by using her legal right given by two international agreements . Turkiye did it for the frequently and conveniently forgotten people of the island , Turkish Cypriots . For those Turkish Cypriots whose grandparents have been living on the island since 1571 . The release of Nikos Sampson , a member of EOKA [ National Organization of Cypriot Fighters ] and a convicted terrorist , shows that the 'enosis ' mentality continues to survive in Greece . One should not forget that Sampson dedicated his life to annihilating the Turks in Cyprus , committed murder to achieve this goal , and tried to destroy the island 's independence by annexing it to Greece . Of course , the Greek governments will have to bear the consequences for this irresponsible conduct . THE MUSEUM OF BARBARISM 2 Irfan Bey Street , Kumsal Area , Nicosia , Cyprus It is the house of Dr. Nihat Ilhan , a major who was serving at the Cyprus Turkish Army Contingent . During the attacks launched against the Turks by the Greeks , on 20th December 1963 , Dr. Nihat Ilhan 's wife and three children were ruthlessly and brutally killed in the bathroom , where they had tried to hide , by savage Greeks . Dr. Nihat Ilhan happened to be on duty that night , the 24th December 1963 . Pictures reflecting Greek atrocities committed during and after 1963 are exhibited in this house which has been converted into a museum . AN EYE-WITNESS ACCOUNT OF HOW A TURKISH FAMILY WAS BUTCHERED BY GREEK TERRORISTS The date is the 24th of December , 1963 ... The onslaught of the Greeks against the Turks , which started three days ago , has been going on with all its ferocity ; and defenseless women , old men and children are being brutally killed by Greeks . And now Kumsal Area of Nicosia witnesses the worst example of the Greeks savage bloodshed ... The wife and the three infant children of Dr. Nihat Ilhan , a major on duty at the camp of the Cyprus Turkish Army Contingent , are mercilessly and dastardly shot dead while hiding in the bathroom of their house , by maddened Greeks who broke into their home . A glaring example of Greek barbarism . Let us now listen to the relating of the said incident told by Mr. Hasan Yusuf Gudum , an eye witness , who himself was wounded during the same terrible event . `` On the night of the 24th of December , 1963 my wife Feride Hasan and I were paying a visit to the family of Major Dr. Nihat Ilhan . Our neighbours Mrs. Ayshe of Mora , her daughter Ishin and Mrs. Ayshe 's sister Novber were also with us . We were all sitting having supper . All of a sudden bullets from the Pedieos River direction started to riddle the house , sounding like heavy rain . Thinking that the dining-room where we were sitting was dangerous , we ran to the bathroom and toilet which we thought would be safer . Altogether we were nine persons . We all hid in the bathroom except my wife who took refuge in the toilet . We waited in fear . Mrs. Ilhan the wife of Major Doctor , was standing in the bath with her three children Murat , Kutsi and Hakan in her arms . Suddenly with a great noise we heard the front door open . Greeks had come in and were combing , every corner of the house with their machine gun bullets . During these moments I heard voices saying , in Greek , `` You want Taksim eh ! '' and then bullets started flying in the bathroom . Mrs. Ilhan and her three children fell into the bath . They were shot . At this moment the Greeks , who broke into the bathroom , emptied their guns on us again . I heard one of the Major 's children moan , then I fainted . When I came to myself 2 or 3 hours later , I saw Mrs. Ilhan and her three children lying dead in the bath . I and the rest of the neighbours in the bathroom were all seriously wounded . But what had happened to my wife ? Then I remembered and immediately ran to the toilet , where , in the doorway , I saw her body . She was brutally murdered . In the street admist the sound of shots I heard voices crying '' Help , help . Is there no one to save us ? '' I became terrified . I thought that if the Greeks came again and found that I was not dead they would kill me . So I ran to the bedroom and hid myself under the double-bed . An our passed by . In the distance I could still hear shots . My mouth was dry , so I came out from under the bed and drank some water . Then I put some sweets in my pocket and went back to the bathroom , which was exactly as I had left in an hour ago . There I offered sweets to Mrs. Ayshe , her daughter and Mrs. Novber who were all wounded . We waited in the bathroom until 5 o'clock in the morning . I thought morning would never come . We were all wounded and needed to be taken to hospital . Finally , as we could walk , Mrs. Novber and I , went out into the street hoping to find help , and walked as far as Koshklu Chiftlik . There , we met some people who took us to hospital where we were operated on . When I regained my consciousness I said that there were more wounded in the house and they went and brought Mrs. Ayshe and her daughter . After staying three days in the hospital I was sent by plane to Ankara for further treatment . There I have had four months treatment but still I can not use my arm . On my return to Cyprus , Greeks arrested me at the Airport . All I have related to you above I told the Greeks during my detention . They then released me . '' ON FOOT INTO CYPRUS 'S DEVASTATED TURKISH QUARTER We went tonight into the sealed-off Turkish quarter of Nicosia in which 200 to 300 people have been slaughtered in the last five days . We were the first Western reporters there , and we saw some terrible sights . In the Kumsal quarter at No . 2 , Irfan Bey Sokagi , we made our way into a house whose floors were covered with broken glass . A child 's bicycle lay in a corner . In the bathroom , looking like a group of waxworks , were three children piled on top of their murdered mother . In a room next to it we glimpsed the body of a woman shot in the head . This , we were told , was the home of a Turkish Army major whose family had been killed by the mob in the first violence . Today was five days later , and still they lay there . Rene MacCOLL and Daniel McGEACHIE , ( From the `` DAILY EXPRESS '' ) '' ... I saw in a bathroom the bodies of a mother and three infant children murdered because their father was a Turkish Officer ...

IL GIARNO ( Italy ) THEY ARE TURK-HUNTING , THEY WANT TO EXTERMINATE THEM . Discussions start in London ; in Cyprus terror continues . Right now we are witnessing the exodus of Turks from the villages . Thousands of people abandoning homes , land , herds ; Greek Cypriot terrorism is relentless . This time , the rhetoric of the Hellenes and the bust of Plato do not suffice to cover up barbaric and ferocious behaviors . Article by Giorgo Bocca , Correspondent of Il Giorno Date : 14 January 1964 DAILY HERALD ( London ) AN APPALLING SIGHT And when I came across the Turkish homes they were an appalling sight . Apart from the walls , they just did not exist . I doubt if a napalm bomb attack could have created more devastation . I counted 40 blackened brick and concrete shells that had once been homes . Each house had been deliberately fired by petrol . Under red tile roofs which had caved in , I found a twisted mass of bed springs , children 's conts and cribs , and ankle deep grey ashes of what had once been chairs , tables and wardrobes . In the neighbouring village of Ayios Vassilios , a mile away , I counted 16 wrecked and burned out homes . They were all Turkish Cypriot homes . From this village more than 100 Turkish Cypriots had also vanished.In neither village did I find a scrap of damage to any Greek Cypriot house . DAILY TELEGRAPH ( London ) GRAVES OF 12 SHOT TURKISH CYPRIOTS FOUND IN CYPRUS VILLAGE Silent crowds gathered tonight outside the Red Crescent hospital in the Turkish Sector of Nicosia , as the bodies of 9 Turkish Cypriots found crudely buried outside the village of Ayios Vassilios , 13 miles away , were brought to the hospital under the escort of the Parachute Regiment . Three more bodies , including one of a woman , were discovered nearby but could not be removed . Turkish Cypriots guarded by paratroops are still trying to locate the bodies of 20 more believed to have been buried on the same site .

New Data Show About 100 Major U.S. Water Supplies Vulnerable To Milwaukee-Type Disease Outbreak To : National Desk , Environment Writer Contact : Erik Olson or Sarah Silver , 202-783-7800 , both of the Natural Resources Defense Council WASHINGTON , April 14 -- Internal EPA data released today by the Natural Resources Defense Council reveals that about 100 large water systems -- serving cities from Boston to San Francisco -- do not filter to remove disease-carrying organisms leaving those communities potentially vulnerable to a disease outbreak similar to the one affecting Milwaukee . The EPA list is attached . `` These internal EPA documents reveal that the safety of water supplies in many American cities is threatened by inadequate pollution controls or filtration , '' said Erik Olson , a senior attorney with NRDC . `` Water contamination is n't just a problem in Bangladesh , it 's also a problem in Bozeman and Boston . '' `` As of June 29 , 1993 , about 100 large surface water systems on EPA 's list probably will be breaking the law . The 1986 Safe Drinking Water Act requires all surface water systems to either filter their water or fully protect the rivers or lakes they use from pollution , '' Olson continued . Some systems are moving towards eventually implementing filtration systems but are expected to miss the law 's deadline . Olson pointed out that the threat of contamination is already a reality in other cities . A 1991 survey of 66 U.S. surface water systems by water utility scientists found that 87 percent of raw water samples contained the Milwaukee organism cryptosporidium , and 81 percent contained a similar parasite called giardia . Adding to the level of concern , a General Accounting Office study released today by House Health and Environment Subcommittee Chairman Henry Waxman indicates serious deficiencies in the nation 's system for conducting and following through on sanitary surveys of water systems . `` This new information raises a huge warning sign that millions of Americans can no longer simply turn on their taps and be assured that their water is safe to drink . We must immediately put into place programs to protect water sources from contamination and where this is not assured , filtration equipment must be installed to protect the public , '' Olson noted . `` The time has come for many of the nation 's water utilities to stop dragging their feet and to aggressively protect their water from contamination ; consumers are prepared to pay the modest costs needed to assure their water is safe to drink .

I beleive , but I wanted to point > out the weakness of logical proofs . Terms are being used in a loaded way here . `` Logical proof '' is an extremely messy thing to apply to real life . If you think otherwise , try to construct a proof that yesterday happened . Obviously it did ; anyone old enough to be reading this was there for it and remembers that it happened . But *proof* ? A proof starts with axioms and goes somewhere . You need axioms to talk about logical proof . You can say that you remember yesterday , and that you take as axiom that anything you clearly remember happened . I could counterclaim that you hallucinated the whole thing . To talk about proofs of historical events , you have to relax the terms a bit . You can show evidences , not proofs . Evidences of the resurrected Jesus exist . Proofs do not . I think Christianity goes down in flames if the resurrection is ever disproved . I also think that this will not happen , as the evidence for the resurrection is quite good as these things go . It is not entirely fair to claim that you can only take the resurrection on faith . There are reasons to believe it that appeal to the mind , too .

I sounds to me , your UPS takes in AC , rectifies it to DC to charge the batteries , and then takes the battery DC and chops it to AC again , feeding your equipment . This approach is the easiest and cleanest way to switchover from the mains to battery once your power kicks out since , as you mentioned , nothing will know about what happened down the line . Another way to do the UPS scheme is to use the mains until you lose power , and then kick in the battery backup with it 's inverter to replace the lost power . The problem here is the switchover time and you 've got to resync the AC in no time flat . Unfortunately , most everything is built around the assumption that AC is available , so the UPS guys have to provide and AC output to be usable ... ya sorta have to make it work with what there already . Similar story with our telephone system . It was first invented back in the 1800 's . We 're still using the same damn system ( media ) as they did back then . If I have a phone from back then , I can assure you it 'll work on today 's phone system . It costs too much to overhaul everyone to a new system , so they make it work with what is out there . .

Good point -- it is very true that these `` false '' predictions are dangerous -- we are warned ( more than once ) in scripture about false prophtets . However , as is often the case with other issues , one can not let those who falsly report such `` visions '' as a reason against believing in any of them ( I did not get the impression you were asserting this , by the way ... I consider my response not so much a response to your posting but a response to the topic as a whole ) . Example : The Appearances of Mary at Fatima , Portugal in 1917 . Among other things , she predicted the conversion of Russia to Atheism ( something that happened less than a year later w/ the Bolshevik revolution ) . She also predicted the second world war ( that is , predicte predicted that it would occur during the papacy of a certain pope , who was not the current one . It happened just like she said . ) She warned there would be `` fire in the sky '' as a warning that the second world war was about to start . About a week before Germany invaded , weathermen ( and women , I suppose ) all over Europe , from England to Spain to Eastern Europe , reported the most spectacular reddish color in the sky ever recorded . To this day some try to explain it off as the northern lights , and the relation to Mary's prediction simply coincidence . You all can decide for yourselves . Mary predicted that the Atheistic Russia would spread her evils all over the world and persecute religion . She said many other things as well , too numerous to list here . Every single one has been realized . One can only use the term `` coincidence '' so many times in the same explanation before its use becomes ridiculous . SO ... yes , there are many false prophets and many false reports . There are true ones , too . We must always remain open to that . Fatima was one example . There is another one , currently occuring -- the apparitions that have been taking place at Medjurgorje , Yugoslavia ( or whatever its called now ) .

BUT unfortunately I am serving my duty in the army right now and I think it 's impossible to prevent anyone from knowing this if I take leaves every day for two weeks for treatment . Thus I bought the prescribed tablets at some drugstore , but to cure it I must get INJECTION of < Streptomycin > , with a dose of 1g every 12 hours , for at least 10 days . I can probably buy the tools and this solution somewhere but I DO N'T KNOW HOW TO DO INJECTION BY MYSELF ! Can any kind people here tell me : If it 's possible to do it ? Can I do it on my arm ? or it must be done on the hip only ? ? Any info is welcome and please write me or post your help SOON ! !

Can have more than one hard drive . Asynchronous Transfer : ~5MB/s max . Why do n't you start with the spec-sheet of the ISA bus first ?

Given the original question ( SCSI used only as a single hard drive controller ) , is it then necessary to get a SCSI drive that will do at least 5 , maybe 10 megs/sec for the SCSI choice to make any sence ?

I think the original EGA card ( or PGA ? ) was $ 800 . SCSI has stood relatively alone in not coming down in price , mainly because we 're talking about PC 's and not Sun 's or Sparc or SGI or ( name your favorite unix workstation ) . That is , after millions of PC buying decisions over the years , SCSI has had plenty of time to come down in price . I wo n't argue that the SCSI standard makes for a good , well implimented data highway , but I still want to know why it intrinsically better ( than IDE , on an ISA bus ) when it comes to multi-tasking OS 's when managing data from a single SCSI hard drive .

Derby ) Expires : Fri , 30 Apr 1993 04:00:00 GMT Organization : Virginia Commonwealth University Keywords : MF Summary : Marlin fans Lines : 23 I was watching the Dodgers/Marlins game yesterday and a couple of things impressed me . First is that the way the sun was shining in Miami , it had a summer atmosphere in early spring for baseball . In comparison Wrigley Field in early April still has a wintry look to it with the dead ivy and bundled up fans . The second and most important was the fans . I like these guys/gals ! I will admit I am a football fan first but I still enjoy baseball . It was interesting because most of these fans are only accustomed to the Miami Dolphins . The way they were cheering , I thought it was the AFC playoffs . Of course opening day may have A LOT to do with it , but I really got feeling of electricity that I think is lacking with a lot of baseball fans in other cities . Baseball certainly needs a charge and I hope these two expansion teams bring back some excitement . We 'll find out Friday how Denver Bronco fans respond . Phillies are 2-0 !

From : crypt-comments @ math.ncsu.edu Subject : Cryptography FAQ 02/10 - Net Etiquette Organization : The Crypt Cabal Lines : 92 Expires : 22 May 1993 04:00:07 GMT Reply-To : crypt-comments @ math.ncsu.edu NNTP-Posting-Host : pad-thai.aktis.com Summary : Part 2 of 10 of the sci.crypt FAQ , Net Etiquette . Related newsgroups , appropriate topics , how to introduce an encryption scheme . X-Last-Updated : 1993/04/16 Archive-name : cryptography-faq/part02 Last-modified : 1993/4/15 FAQ for sci.crypt , part 2 : Net Etiquette This is the second of ten parts of the sci.crypt FAQ . The parts are mostly independent , but you should read the first part before the rest . We do n't have the time to send out missing parts by mail , so do n't ask . Notes such as `` [ KAH67 ] '' refer to the reference list in the last part . The sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu as /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part [ xx ] . The Cryptography FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt , sci.answers , and news.answers every 21 days . Contents : * What groups are around ? What 's a FAQ ? Who am I ? Why am I here ? * Do political discussions belong in sci.crypt ? * How do I present a new encryption scheme in sci.crypt ? * What groups are around ? What 's a FAQ ? Who am I ? Why am I here ? Read news.announce.newusers and news.answers for a few weeks . Always make sure to read a newsgroup for some time before you post to it . You 'll be amazed how often the same question can be asked in the same newsgroup . After a month you 'll have a much better sense of what the readers want to see . * Do political discussions belong in sci.crypt ? No . In fact some newsgroups ( notably misc.legal.computing ) were created exactly so that political questions like `` Should RSA be patented ? '' do n't get in the way of technical discussions . Many sci.crypt readers also read misc.legal.computing , comp.org.eff.talk , comp.patents , sci.math , comp.compression , et al . ; for the benefit of people who do n't care about those other topics , try to put your postings in the right group . Questions about microfilm and smuggling and other non-cryptographic `` spy stuff '' do n't belong in sci.crypt either . * How do I present a new encryption scheme in sci.crypt ? `` I just came up with this neat method of encryption . Here 's some ciphertext : FHDSIJOYW^ & % $ * # @ OGBUJHKFSYUIRE . Is it strong ? '' Without a doubt questions like this are the most annoying traffic on sci.crypt . If you have come up with an encryption scheme , providing some ciphertext from it is not adequate . Nobody has ever been impressed by random gibberish . Any new algorithm should be secure even if the opponent knows the full algorithm ( including how any message key is distributed ) and only the private key is kept secret . There are some systematic and unsystematic ways to take reasonably long ciphertexts and decrypt them even without prior knowledge of the algorithm , but this is a time-consuming and possibly fruitless exercise which most sci.crypt readers wo n't bother with . So what do you do if you have a new encryption scheme ? First of all , find out if it 's really new . Look through this FAQ for references and related methods . Familiarize yourself with the literature and the introductory textbooks . When you can appreciate how your cryptosystem fits into the world at large , try to break it yourself ! You should n't waste the time of tens of thousands of readers asking a question which you could have easily answered on your own . If you really think your system is secure , and you want to get some reassurance from experts , you might try posting full details of your system , including working code and a solid theoretical explanation , to sci.crypt . ( Keep in mind that the export of cryptography is regulated in some areas . ) If you 're lucky an expert might take some interest in what you posted . You can encourage this by offering cash rewards -- -for instance , noted cryptographer Ralph Merkle is offering $ 1000 to anyone who can break Snefru-4 -- -but there are no guarantees . If you do n't have enough experience , then most likely any experts who look at your system will be able to find a flaw . If this happens , it 's your responsibility to consider the flaw and learn from it , rather than just add one more layer of complication and come back for another round . A different way to get your cryptosystem reviewed is to have the NSA look at it . A full discussion of this procedure is outside the scope of this FAQ . Among professionals , a common rule of thumb is that if you want to design a cryptosystem , you have to have experience as a cryptanalyst .

No need to be sorry , I blew it on this one . At the main breaker box where there is a thick wire ground leading to the earth , both neutral and ground are hooked to this bus . In any other breaker box ( or an outlet box , etc . ) the ground and neutral must not be connected together .

From : cower @ csli.stanford.edu ( Richard Cower ) Subject : Waco dates - are these coincidental ? Organization : CSLI , Stanford University Distribution : usa Lines : 34 The ATF agent interviewed on `` Street Stories '' reported that the raid was ill planned , and went ahead even when they ( the BD 's ) knew the ATF was coming . WHY ? I believe this raid was ill planned because they only had 2 days to plan it , and it was continued when failure was obvious because it had a bit part in the much larger political agenda of President Clinton . I would even suggest that the loss of 4 ATF agents is inconsequential in this the context of his political agenda . It MIGHT even be beneficial to his agenda , as it helps point up just how evil these assualt weapons are . Further proof might be that the ATF denied their agents ( Street Stories report ) requests for sufficient fire power . Important dates : Feb 25th - NJ assembly votes to overturn assault weapon ban . Feb 28th - Compound in Waco attacked . On Feb. 25th the New Jersey assembly voted to overturn the assault weapon ban in that state . It looked like it might be a tight vote , but the Senate in N.J. was going to vote to overturn the ban . It would not sit well to have an Eastern state overturn an assault weapon ban , given Clintons stated agenda on gun control . I suspect Clinton gave the order to get someone or some group with assualt weapons and have the press present ( they were initially at the incident in Waco ) to record the event for the TV audience . The agent on `` Street Stories '' reported that a supervisor was urging them all to `` get ready fast '' , as `` they know we are coming '' . I believe this attack continued , even tho the probablility of failure was high , because it came from the top down . After the N.J. assembly vote , the ATF had a limited amount of time to come up with something , and the Wackos in Waco fit the bill nicely . ... rich
From : keller @ hubble.ifa.hawaii.edu ( Tim Keller ) Subject : airhorns on an FJ1100 review Organization : Institute for Astronomy , Hawaii Lines : 44 For those of you who are thinking about fiamms , you might also want to think about airhorns . I just installed a set of Bosch air horns ordered from Dennis Kirk ( pg . 282 of the latest catalog ) on my '85 FJ1100 . They are rated at 93db at 7 meters . I installed them using 10 gage wire from the battery to the relay to the compressor to ground . My stock horn connectors fit the relay pins just fine . I soldered the connections to the relay and compressor , and used a crimp type battery connector and an inline 10amp fuse/connector from NAPA . I installed the compressor just forward of the fuse box in the front fairing by tie wrapping between the steering head frame and the black steel tube frame used to support the front fairing . You have to remove the front fairing to do this , but it fits outside of the frame but inside the fairing on the two vertical supports just in front of the fuses . Depending how tight your fairing follows the frame , you should be able to fit it somewhere in the fairing . The compressor is about 2 '' in diameter and about 5 '' long . The relay mounted on the front of the steering head frame ( it is small so there should be plenty of good places for it . I found a perfect place for the horns that required only tie wraps to mount . The horns fit inside the front fairing/frame and stick out on either side just in front of the air scoops , but behind the turn signals . The back of the horns point back towards the center of the bike and come real close to where the gas tank connects to the front part of the frame . There is just enough room to the outside to allow full lock to lock clearance , and there are nice cut outs in the frame for the back of the horn to go into . The short horn is even with the fairing , and the long one sticks out about an inch or so , but it is really not that noticable unless you look closely . They end up pointing down slightly and maybe 30 degrees from straight ahead ( perfect for those cagers trying to change lanes into you ) . If you have any other questions about the mounting , email , and I can try to explain better . If your bike is not red , then you may want to paint them first . How do they work you ask ? They are very , very , very *LOUD* . They sound more like a european sports car than a truck , but a vast improvement over stock . I have used them at least daily since installing them , and the 10 amp fuse has not blown yet ( although , the duration of the horn blasts have been short ) . I 've repeatedly scared the shit out of my friends with them , even though they know that I have the horns , they still jump . They are perfect for keeping the pedestrians on the sidewalk . The bottom line is they work , are loud enough to cause pain and suffering to those stupid lane changing cages ( as well as take a few years off their lives ) and are relatively easy to install on the FJ .

Odishe Liyetze on the Turkish front , he wrote , '' On the nights 11-12 March , 1918 alone Armenian butchers bayoneted and axed to death 3000 Muslims in areas surrounding Erzincan . These barbars threw their victims into pits , most likely dug according to their sinister plans to extinguish Muslims , in groups of 80 . My adjutant counted and unearthed 200 such pits . This is an act against our world of civilization . '' On March 12 , 1918 Lieut-colonel Griyaznof wrote ( from an official Russian account of the Turkish genocide ) , '' Roads leading to villages were littered with bayoneted torsos , dismembered joints and carved out organs of Muslim peasants ... alas ! mainly of women and children . '' Source : Doc . Dr. Azmi Suslu , `` Russian View on the Atrocities Committed by the Armenians Against the Turks , '' Ankara Universitesi , Ankara , 1987 , pp . 45-53 . `` Document No : 77 , '' Archive No : 1-2 , Cabin No : 10 , Drawer No : 4 , File No : 410 , Section No : 1578 , Contents No : 1-12 , 1-18 . ( Acting Commander of Erzurum and Deveboynu regions and Commander of the Second Erzurum Artillery Regiment Prisoner of War , Lieutenant Colonel Toverdodleyov ) '' The things I have heard and seen during the two months , until the liberation of Erzurum by the Turks , have surpassed all the allegations concerning the vicious , degenerate characteristic of the Armenians . During the Russian occupation of Erzurum , no Armenian was permitted to approach the city and its environs . While the Commander of the First Army Corps , General Kaltiyin remained in power , troops including Armenian enlisted men , were not sent to the area . When the security measures were lifted , the Armenians began to attack Erzurum and its surroundings . Following the attacks came the plundering of the houses in the city and the villages and the murder of the owners of these houses ... Plundering was widely committed by the soldiers . This plunder was mainly committed by Armenian soldiers who had remained in the rear during the war . One day , while passing through the streets on horseback , a group of soldiers including an Armenian soldier began to drag two old men of seventy years in a certain direction . The roads were covered with mud , and these people were dragging the two helpless Turks through the mud and dirt ... It was understood later that all these were nothing but tricks and traps . The Turks who joined the gendarmarie soon changed their minds and withdrew . The reason was that most of the Turks who were on night patrol did not return , and no one knew what had happened to them . The Turks who had been sent outside the city for labour began to disappear also . Finally , the Court Martial which had been established for the trials of murderers and plunderers , began to liquidate itself for fear that they themselves would be punished . The incidents of murder and rape , which had decreased , began to occur more frequently . Sometime in January and February , a leading Turkish citizen Haci Bekir Efendi from Erzurum , was killed one night at his home . The Commander in Chief ( Odiselidge ) gave orders to find murderers within three days . The Commander in Chief has bitterly reminded the Armenian intellectuals that disobedience among the Armenian enlisted men had reached its highest point , that they had insulted and robbed the people and half of the Turks sent outside the city had not returned . ... We learnt the details this incident from the Commander-in-Chief , Odishelidge . They were as follows : The killings were organized by the doctors and the employers , and the act of killing was committed solely by the Armenian renegades ... More than eight hundred unarmed and defenceless Turks have been killed in Erzincan . Large holes were dug and the defenceless Turks were slaughtered like animals next to the holes . Later , the murdered Turks were thrown into the holes . The Armenian who stood near the hole would say when the hole was filled with the corpses : 'Seventy dead bodies , well , this hole can take ten more . ' Thus ten more Turks would be cut into pieces , thrown into the hole , and when the hole was full it would be covered over with soil . The Armenians responsible for the act of murdering would frequently fill a house with eighty Turks , and cut their heads off one by one . Following the Erzincan massacre , the Armenians began to withdraw towards Erzurum ... The Armenian renegades among those who withdrew to Erzurum from Erzincan raided the Moslem villages on the road , and destroyed the entire population , together with the villages . During the transportation of the cannons , ammunition and the carriages that were outside the war area , certain people were hired among the Kurdish population to conduct the horse carriages . While the travellers were passing through Erzurum , the Armenians took advantage of the time when the Russian soldiers were in their dwellings and began to kill the Kurds they had hired . When the Russian soldiers heard the cries of the dying Kurds , they attempted to help them . However , the Armenians threatened the Russian soldiers by vowing that they would have the same fate if they intervened , and thus prevented them from acting . All these terrifying acts of slaughter were committed with hatred and loathing . Lieutenant Medivani from the Russian Army described an incident that he witnessed in Erzurum as follows : An Armenian had shot a Kurd . The Kurd fell down but did not die . The Armenian attempted to force the stick in his hand into the mouth of the dying Kurd . However , since the Kurd had firmly closed his jaws in his agony , the Armenian failed in his attempt . Having seen this , the Armenian ripped open the abdomen of the Kurd , disembowelled him , and finally killed him by stamping him with the iron heel of his boot . Odishelidge himself told us that all the Turks who could not escape from the village of Ilica were killed . Their heads had been cut off by axes . He also told us that he had seen thousands of murdered children . Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov , who passed through the village of Ilica , three weeks after the massacre told us the following : There were thousands of dead bodies hacked to pieces , on the roads . Every Armenian who happened to pass through these roads , cursed and spat on the corpses . In the courtyard of a mosque which was about 25x30 meter square , dead bodies were piled to a height of 140 centimeters . Among these corpses were men and women of every age , children and old people . The women 's bodies had obvious marks of rape . The genitals of many girls were filled with gun-powder . A few educated Armenian girls , who worked as telephone operators for the Armenian troops were called by Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov to the courtyard of the mosque and he bitterly told them to be proud of what the Armenians had done . To the lieutenant colonel's disgusted amazement , the Armenian girls started to laugh and giggle , instead of being horrified . The lieutenant colonel had severely reprimanded those girls for their indecent behaviour . When he told the girls that the Armenians , including women , were generally more licentious than even the wildest animals , and that their indecent and shameful laughter was the most obvious evidence of their inhumanity and barbarity , before a scene that appalled even veteran soldiers , the Armenian girls finally remembered their sense of shame and claimed they had laughed because they were nervous . An Armenian contractor at the Alaca Communication zone command narrated the following incident which took place on February 20 : The Armenians had nailed a Turkish women to the wall . They had cut out the women 's heart and placed the heart on top of her head . The great massacre in Erzurum began on February 7 ... The enlisted men of the artillery division caught and stripped 270 people . Then they took these people into the bath to satisfy their lusts . 100 people among this group were able to save their lives as the result of my decisive attempts . The others , the Armenians claimed , were released when they learnt that I understood what was going on . Among those who organized this treacherous act was the envoy to the Armenian officers , Karagodaviev . Today , some Turks were murdered on the streets . On February 12 , some Armenians have shot more than ten innocent Moslems . The Russian soldiers who attempted to save these people were threatened with death . Meanwhile I imprisoned an Armenian for murdering an innocent Turk . When an Armenian officer told an Armenian murderer that he would be hanged for his crime , the killer shouted furiously : 'How dare you hang an Armenian for killing a Turk ? ' In Erzurum , the Armenians burned down the Turkish market . On February 17 , I heard that the entire population of Tepekoy village , situated within the artillery area , had been totally annihilated . On the same day when Antranik entered Erzurum , I reported the massacre to him , and asked him to track down the perpetrators of this horrible act . However no result was achieved . In the villages whose inhabitants had been massacred , there was a natural silence . On the night of 26/27 February , the Armenians deceived the Russians , perpetrated a massacre and escaped for fear of the Turkish soldiers . Later , it was understood that this massacre had been based upon a method organized and planned in a circular . The population had been herded in a certain place and then killed one by one . The number of murders committed on that night reached three thousand . It was the Armenians who bragged to about the details of the massacre . The Armenians fighting against the Turkish soldiers were so few in number and so cowardly that they could not even withstand the Turkish soldiers who consisted of only five hundred people and two cannons , for one night , and ran away . The leading Armenians of the community could have prevented this massacre . However , the Armenian intellectuals had shared the same ideas with the renegades in this massacre , just as in all the others . The lower classes within the Armenian community have always obeyed the orders of the leading Armenian figures and commanders . I do not like to give the impression that all Armenian intellectuals were accessories to these murders . No , for there were people who opposed the Armenians for such actions , since they understood that it would yield no result . However , such people were only a minority . Furthermore , such people were considered as traitors to the Armenian cause . Some have seemingly opposed the Armenian murders but have supported the massacres secretly . Some , on the other hand , preferred to remain silent . There were certain others , who , when accused by the Russians of infamy , would say the following : 'You are Russians . You can never understand the Armenian cause . ' The Armenians had a conscience . They would commit massacres and then would flee in fear of the Turkish soldiers . '' Serdar Argic 'We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the Turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination .

Here is a short description and some technical information , taken from the accompanying documentation : DMPEG V1.0 Public Domain MPEG decoder by Stefan Eckart 0 . Features =========== DMPEG/DMPLAY is another MPEG decoder/player for the PC : - decodes ( nearly ) the full MPEG video standard ( I , P , B frames , frame size up to at least 352x240 supported ) - saves decoded sequence in 8 or 24bit raw file for later display - optional on-screen display during decoding ( requires VGA ) - several dithering options : ordered dither , Floyd-Steinberg , grayscale - color-space selection - runs under DOS , 640KB RAM , no MS-Windows required - very compact ( small code / small data models , 16 bit arithmetic ) - real time display of the raw file by a separate player for VGA and many Super-VGAs ... 4 . Technical information ======================== The player is a rather straightforward implementation of the MPEG spec [ 1 ] . The IDCT is based on the Chen-Wang 13 multiplication algorithm [ 2 ] ( not quite the optimum , I know ) . Blocks with not more than eight non-zero coefficients use a non-separated direct multiply-accumulate 2D-IDCT ( sounds great , does n't it ? ) , which turned out to be faster than a 'fast' algorithm in this ( quite common ) case . Dithering is pretty standard . Main difference to the Berkeley decoder ( except for the fewer number of supported algorithms ) is the use of 256 instead of 128 colors , the ( default ) option to use a restricted color-space and the implementation of a color saturation dominant ordered dither . This leads to a significantly superior quality of the dithered image ( I claim , judge yourself ) . Restricted color-space means that the U and V components are clipped to +/-0.25 ( instead of +/-0.5 ) and the display color-space points are distributed over this restricted space . Since the distance between color-space points is thus reduced by a factor of two , the color resolution is doubled at the expense of not being able to represent fully saturated colors . Saturation dominant ordered dither is a method by which a color , lying somewhere between the points of the display color space , is approximated by primarily alternating between two points of constant hue instead of constant saturation . This yields subjectivly better quality due to the lower sensitivity of the human viewing system to saturation changes than to hue changes ( the same reasoning as used by the PAL TV standard to improve on NTSC ) . The improvement is particularly visible in dark brown or redish areas . ... -- Stefan Eckart , stefan @ lis.e-technik.tu-muenchen.de
From : seth @ cbnewsh.cb.att.com ( peter.r.clark..jr ) Subject : FLYERS notes 4/5 Organization : AT & T Keywords : FLYERS/Leafs summary ( take that , Leafs woofers ! ) Lines : 225 The FLYERS team that can beat any team on any night showed up at the Spectrum Sunday night , and dominated the Maple Leafs thoroughly en route to a 4-0 shutout . Tommy Soderstrom will get credit for the shutout , but he barely broke a sweat until the third period as the FLYERS defense kept the Leafs from mounting any serious attack . Injuries : Pelle Eklund is day-to-day with a bruised thigh . Roster Moves : Jason Bowen was added to the lineup for his first NHL game . Jason was the FLYERS second pick in the first round ( 15th overall ) of the 1992 entry draft . 19 years old , 6 ' 4 '' , 210 lbs . In 62 games with the tri-city Americans he had 10 goals , 12 assists and 219 PIM . He plays left wing and defense , he played defense in this game although Bobby Taylor said that Bill Dineen was planning to use him up front as well . Andre Faust was returned to Hershey . He actually left after the second period of the Kings game , flew to Albany , got the game tying goal in a Bears OT win , and played again for Hershey Sunday night . Lines : Fedyk-Lindros-Recchi Beranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen Lomakin-Butsayev-Conroy Acton-Brown Galley-McGill Yushkevich-Cronin Carkner-Hawgood Bowen Tommy Soderstrom in goal . Acton replaced Lomakin in the 3rd period . Game Summary : If the FLYERS played like this every night , they 'd be in the playoffs this year . The FLYERS hit everything that moved . They created scoring chance after scoring chance . They snuffed out everything that the Leafs tried to do . Jason Bowen made a good play on his first NHL shift that almost created a goal . He had the puck in the top of the left offensive circle all alone , but instead of taking the shot he found Brind'Amour crashing the net on the other side . A perfect pass and a good shot across Daren Puppa 's body should have been a goal , but Puppa made a great save reading the play . Garry Galley gave the Maple Leafs 7th ranked power play the first chance when he hooked Doug Gilmour at 4:25 . The FLYERS lowly 21st ranked penalty killing unit was almost flawless the entire game , and set the tone on this kill . The Maple Leafs got almost nothing but long unscreened shots , and the defense swept away every rebound . After the power play , the FLYERS got a goal on an ugly play . Rod Brind'Amour gave the puck to Greg Hawgood at the right point , and he sent a drive at the net . Puppa made the save and kicked the rebound right into the feet of Josef Beranek and Bob Rouse , who were wrestling in the slot . Beranek was able to get his stick on the puck and push it out to Dineen who was skating into the slot from the right circle , and he lifted a backhander over Puppa for a 1-0 FLYERS lead at 8:10 . The FLYERS kept the pressure on , and Puppa was the only Leaf keeping the FLYERS from building on their lead for a while . Eventually things settled down and defense prevailed . Each team got an occasional scoring chance , but the goalies were strong . Bowen started giving some Lindros-like checks in his own corners . Then Lindros , who was looking to avenge a hit Foligno gave him , thought he had a chance to even the score . He had Foligno lined up at center ice , leaned into him , and rode him into the center ice boards . The only problem was that Foligno was a little far from the boards , and Mike `` Mister '' McGeough felt that it warranted a boarding call at 15:38 The Leafs could n't get anything going on the power play as the FLYERS were very aggressive ( for a change ) on the kill . With time running out in the period , Recchi carried through the neutral zone and handed to Lindros as they approached the Leaf 's blue line . They were in a crowd with Wendell Clark and Jamie Macoun , Lindros tried a backhand pass to Recchi through the feet of Macoun that connected to Recchi , but then Clark checked Recchi off the puck . Macoun then tried to clear , but it was weak and went right to McGill who had manned the point . He drove it from just inside the blue line . Macoun got his stick on it and deflected it past his own goalie at 19:55.1 . Shots were 13-8 FLYERS in the period . The FLYERS finally got their first chance on the power play when Dave Andreychuk tripped up Rod Brind'Amour in his offensive zone . During the power play , the FLYERS got cheated a little when the puck popped up into the air and Eric gloved it down , but McGeough thought it hit his stick above his head . We could see from our seats at the other end of the ice that it only hit his glove and the replay confirmed , but the faceoff went to the other end . As time was running out in the advantage , Lindros found Galley with a pass across the goal mouth but Puppa made the save . The rebound kicked back to the right corner where Recchi picked it up , passed it out to Eric crashing through the right circle , and Eric one-timed past Puppa at 7:55 . With the assist , Recchi moves past Bobby Clarke 's 74-75 season , the second best one season total for a FLYER at 117 . Eric moves up to 4th all time in FLYERS rookie scoring with 67 points . Mike Eastwood took down Al Conroy at 8:30 to give the FLYERS another chance on the power play . Not much pressure before Garry Galley ended the power play with a slash at 9:19 . Not much happened on the 4 on 4 , although the Leafs had most of the possession . The FLYERS smothered the Leafs short power play . Tempers flared a little at 13:14 . Bowen and Pearson got roughing minors , Keith Acton got a bloody face . Dave McLlwain then took a dive and got Greg Hawgood a hooking minor at 13:46 to set up a 4 on 3 . The replay showed that Hawgood's stick stopped making contact with McLlwain long before he spun around and fell . Again the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play , led by Dimitri Yushkevich . Bowen made a thundering hit when he came out of the box on Pearson . Berehowski tried to perplex everybody with his sloooowball . He had the puck at the point , and just trickled a pass down the slot . He made all the FLYERS look silly as nobody could get a stick on it , and it got to Gilmour at the side of the net , but Soderstrom stoned him . The FLYERS picked things up offensively after the kill was over , but didn't get anything home . Shots were 13-10 FLYERS . The FLYERS were content with the 3 goal lead in the third period , and they decided that if Tommy wanted a shutout , he was going to have to work for it a little . The FLYERS got most of the scoring chances in the first 7 or so minutes of the period , but could n't get past Puppa . Then the Leafs got tired of Lindros making road kill out of them , and tempers flared . 2 each for Doug Gilmour and Lindros ( unsportsmanlike conduct ) and 2 each for Glenn Anderson and McGill ( roughing ) all at 7:02 . Terry Carkner then took a kneeing penalty at 7:51 on Gilmour . Again the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play . At about the 12 minute mark , Dave Andreychuk got a shot away from his left circle that got through Soderstrom . The puck was rolling on it 's side , and as luck would have it it turned away from the net instead of turning towards it ( think of how a rolling quarter inevitably starts to lean one way or the other ) . Seconds later Rod Brind'Amour tripped up Gilmour at 12:24 to give the Leafs another chance on the power play . On the advantage , after Soderstrom stoned Andreychuk while lying down , Andreychuk got the rebound through Soderstrom , but from behind the net and it went straight through and was swept away by one of his defensemen . They kept the pressure on , but Soderstrom was equal and preserved the shutout . Recchi cross checked Ken Baumgartner to get tempers hot and start a brawl at 16:01 . No punches thrown , Recchi got the initial minor , Krushelnyski Baumgartner and Lindros each got roughing minors . At 17:02 Rouse and Beranek expressed their mutual dislike for each other and got 2 each for slashing to set up another 4 on 4 . Mike Eastwood shoved down Ryan McGill in the FLYERS zone as they were battling for the puck , and while McGill was down he ran his stick across McGill 's face . The FLYERS were not happy with that at all . 5-8 Al Conroy paired up with 6-1 Berehowski , and started throwing punches . Upward . Well , Al held his own , much to the delight of the crowd . Each got a couple punches in before going down in a head , and Al got a standing O ! Penalties : Eastwood 5 ( cross check ) + game , Clark , Carkner 10 each . Berehowski and Conroy 5 each ( fighting ) at 17:49 . So a major penalty for the rest of the game for the FLYERS . The had no interest in stting on the lead . Hawgood , Galley and Brind'Amour played catch until Hawgood found Dineen all alone in the left circle , he controlled the puck and blasted it past Puppa at 18:39 . That was all the fireworks , Tommy Soderstrom would not face another shot . Puppa did , but kept the FLYERS off the board . 4-0 FLYERS , shots were 9-8 FLYERS in the 3rd . Probably the strongest game I 've seen from the FLYERS since the All Star break . Shutout number 4 for Soderstrom , all since 1/10 . Tied for 2nd most in the NHL , but he 's played fewer games than Belfour ( 6 ) or the goalie I can't remember that he 's tied with . Next up it 's the Winnipeg Selannes Tuesday night in Winnipeg . The FLYERS can not be eliminated if they win , but a loss coupled with an Islander win that night in Washington would be the official end . FLYERS up to 71 points on the season in 78 games . Last year they had 75 points in 80 games ( 5 under .500 ) , so they need at least 8 points in their last 6 games to improve on that only by percentage points ( 5 under in 84 is better than 5 under in 80 ) . Tragic number holds at 3 points with 6 games left . The tragic number for 5th is 5 points , I watched the Rangers blow a 4-2 third period lead at home to lose 5-4 before I finished this up . Why 5 points instead of 4 ? Well , the FLYERS will win the tie-breaker if they catch them , whereas the Islanders win tie breakers against the FLYERS and so need only a tie . The Rangers could crumble down the stretch as they play the Devils , the Pens twice , the FLYERS , and finish up with 2 games against the Caps . So I guess 5th place could be the goal for the team to focus on .

Reply-To : ngorelic @ speclab.cr.usgs.gov Organization : Colorado School of Mines Lines : 27 [ again , poseted for a friend ] Okay , I got such great response from my last question ( thanks , everyone ) , lets try again : How can I tell if a colorcell is read-only ? I want to use any read-only cells that are already in my colormap once I start running out of allocatable cells , using some arbitrary nearest color matching scheme to get those cells that come closest to a requested color . Once I determine if a cell is read-only , I assume I can then just request an XAllocColor ( ) with the exact same color specifications and it will then be flagged as 'used ' by my application so that it does n't later get freed by someone else and allocated again as read-write to another application . So far , the only way I 've figured out to do this is to write my own error handler and just go ahead and request the cells colors , once my colormap is all full up . It should error out if the cell is non-shareable . But life would be much easier if I could just detect the read-only/shareable stuff directly ... Any ideas ? Noel ( ngorelic @ speclab.cr.usgs.gov )

It *does* > imply that those who rely on faulty methodology and reasoning are > incapable of discovering *which* treatments are effective and > which are not . ) To start with , no methodology or form of reasoning is infallible . So there 's a question of how much certainty we are willing to pay for in a given context . Insistence on too much rigor bogs science down completely and makes progress impossible . ( Expenditure of sufficiently large sums of money and amounts of time can sometimes overcome this . ) On the other hand , with too little rigor much is lost by basing work on results which eventually turn out to be false . There is a morass of studies contradicting other studies and outsiders start saying `` You people call THIS science ? '' ( My opinion , for what it 's worth , is that one sees both these phenomena happening simultaneously in some parts of psychology . ) Some subjective judgement is required to decide on the level of rigor appropriate for a particular investigation . I do n't believe it is ever possible to banish subjective judgement from science . My second point , though , is that highly capable people can often make extremely reliable judgements about scientific validity even when using methodology considered inadequate by the usual standards . I think this is true of many scientists and I think it is true of many who approach their discipline in a way that is not generally recognized as scientific . Within mathematics , I think there are several examples , especially before the twentieth century . One conspicuous case is that of Riemann , who is famous for many theorems he stated but did not prove . ( Later mathematicians did prove them , of course . ) I think that for a good scientist , empirical investigation is often not so much a matter of determining what is true and what 's not as it is a matter of convincing other people . ( People have proposed lots of incompatible definitions of science here , but I think the ability to objectively convince others of the validity of one 's results is an essential element . Not that one can necessarily do that at every step of the scientific process , but I think that if one is not moving toward that goal then one is not doing science . ) When a person other than a scientist is quite good at what he does and seems to be very successful at it , I think that his judgements are also worthy of respect and that his assertions are well worth further investigation . In article < C53By5.HD @ news.Hawaii.Edu > I wrote : > Namely , is there really justification for the belief that > science is a superior path to truth than non-scientific approaches ? Admittedly , my question was not at all well posed . A considerable amount of effort in a `` serious scholarly investigation '' such as I suggested would be required simply to formulate an appropriately specific question to try and answer . The `` science '' I was thinking of in my question is the actual science currently practiced now in the last decade of the twentieth century . I certainly was n't thinking of some idealized science or the mere use of `` reason and observation . '' One thing I had in mind in my suggestion was the question as to whether in many cases the subjective judgements of skilled and experienced practitioners might be more reliable than statistical studies . Since Russell Turpin seems to be much more familiar than I am with the study of scientific methodology , perhaps he can tell us if there is any existing research related to this question . -- In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists , psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects . lady @ uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu lady @ uhunix.bitnet

Just wanted to glow a little . I know what you mean ! I glow everytime Ronnie 's out on the ice . In fact , one of the neatest things about seeing the Pens in person is that I can key in on him instead of watching what I 'd probably be seeing on tv . He does so many subtle things behind the play . He said in an interview recently that when he was a kid his dad stressed the importance of playing two-way hockey ; that you have to learn how to play defense as well as offense and he obviously took that advice to heart . He was a breath of fresh air when he arrived in Pittsburgh to the team whose forwards , for the most part , couldn't and would n't play a lick of defense . It 's really difficult to assess what the key trades were that brought all of this success to the Pens . You mention Rick Tocchet and he has certainly helped , and even ol ' Kjell has been steady . But looking at this team you could almost take any one of them out of the line-up permanently and replace them with an extremely mediocre player and it would n't matter . If I had to pick the top three acquisitions in recent years they would be 1 ) Tom Barrasso ; 2 ) Ron Francis ; 3 ) Larry Murphy . ( I 'd love to put Francis first but I do think the only thing that could really damage the Pens right now would be to lose Barrasso . ) Mom .

Beyond that , I have no other info . The sightings were apparently spurious . There is no planet inside of the orbit of Mercury . The idea of Vulcan came from the differences between Mercury 's observed perihelion precession and the value it should have had according to Newtonian physics . Leverrier made an extensive set of observations and calculations during the mid 19th century , and Simon Newcombe later improved on the observations and re-calculated using Leverrier 's system of equations . Now Leverrier was one of the co-discoverers of Neptune and since he had predicted its existence based on anomalies in the orbit of Uranus his inclination was to believe the same sort of thing was afoot with Mercury . But alas , 'twere not so . Mercury 's perihelion precesses at the rate it does because the space where it resides near the sun is significantly curved due to the sun 's mass . This explanation had to wait until 1915 and Albert Einstein 's synthesis of his earlier theory of the electrodynamics of moving bodies ( commonly called Special Relativity ) with Reimanian geometry . The result was the General Theory of Relativity , and one of it 's most noteworthy strengths is that it accounts for the precession of Mercury 's perihelion almost exactly . ( Exactly if you use Newcomb's numbers rather than Leverrier 's . ) Of course not everybody believes Einstein , and that 's fine . But subsequent efforts to find any planets closer to the sun than Mercury using radar have been fruitless . -Bill Gawne `` Forgive him , he is a barbarian , who thinks the customs of his tribe are the laws of the universe .

You are so correct - Clinton did not initiate it . He just cast it in GRANITE by implimenting , NOT stopping the DECISION . I also stated in another post I do n't give a damn what administration does it , I still find it totally unacceptable , and whoever impliments it or rams it down our throats ought to be run out of office . Also , Bush was not trying to deprive us of our Second Amendment rights . Clinton is BUSTING HIS BUTT in that regard . That reveals a total difference in philosophy . Clinton appears to support the idea of TOTAL people control . Eavesdropping whenever they feel like it , no real security for the common person , and no ability to defend oneself against illegal attack , from whatever source . `` Trust us , we will protect ( and control ) you ... if we do n't find it inconvenient ... '' Clinton has also shown his utter contempt for public disclosure and accountability , as well . He had plenty of time to change the policy . HE DID N'T . HE EXPANDED ON IT .

It does not say that it deters an individual from committing a capital crime in the first place . The true question is whether the threat of death is likely to actually stop one from murdering . ( Or commiting treason -- are there any other capital crimes anywhere in the USA ? ) That is , if there were no death penalty , would its introduction deter a would-be criminal from committing her/his crime ? I doubt it . This is only the first step . Even if it were a strong deterrent ( short of being a complete deterrent ) I would reject it . For what about the case of the innocent executed ? And even if we could eliminate this possibility , I would reject the death penalty as immoral . This makes me something of a radical on the issue , although I think there are many opponents of captial punishment who agree with me , but who find the innocent executed the strongest argument to make . I would , if magically placed in charge , facilitate state-aided suicide for criminals who have life-sentences . This could be a replacement for capital punishment .

I 'll typein the handout he gave out at the meeting . Here goes : The Microlight Solar Sail -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 1 . Introduction The solar sail is a well-established concept . Harnessing the pressure of sunlight , a spacecraft would have unlimited range . In principle , such a vehicle could explore the whole Solar System with zero fuel consumption . However it is more difficult to design a practical solar sail than most people realize . The pressure of sunlight is only about one kilogram per square kilometer . Deploying and controlling the large area of aluminized fabric which would be necessary to transport a 'conventional ' type spacecraft is a daunting task . This is why , despite the potential of hte idea , no such craft has actually been launched to date . 2.Design Recent advances in microelectronics make possible a different concept : a tiny sail just a few metres in diameter which could be controlled purely be electronics , with no mechanical parts . Several attitude control methods are feasible : for example the pressure sunlight exerts on a panel of solar cells varies according to whether power is being drawn . The key components of the craft will be a minute CCD camera developed at Edinburgh University which can act as both attitude sensor and data gathering device ; solar cells providing ~1 watt power for control and communication ; and a directional radio antenna etched onto the surface of the sail itself . Launched as a piggyback payload , the total cost of the mission can be limited to a few tens of thousands of dollars . 3.Missions The craft would be capable of some ambitious missions . For example : a ) It could rendezvous with a nearby asteroid from the Apollo or Amor groups . Closeup pictures could be transmitted back to Earth at a low bit rate . b ) It could be steered into a lunar polar orbit . Previously unobserved areas around the lunar poles could be viewed . By angling the sail to reflect sunlight downwards , polar craters whose bases never receive sunlight could be imaged . Bright reflections would confirm that volatiles such as water ice have become trapped in these locations . [ Immensely valuable information for setting up a manned lunar base , BTW ] c ) It could be sent to rendezvous with a small asteroid or comet nucleus . Impacting at low speed , a thin wire probe attached to the craft causes it to rebound while capturing a tiny sample is a sharp-edged tube , like performing a biopsy . Returning to Earth , the sail acts as an ideal re-entry parachute : load per unit area 20 gm/m2 ensures that heat is reradiated so efectively that the sail temperature can not exceed ~300 deg C. The material sample is recovered , enclosed in a small insulating container .

That 's not a huge difference in a parliamentary system . Your statement is a common misconception , but it just is n't true . In the German Weimar system , the Chancellor was not necessarily the leader of the largest Reichstag party ; the Chancellor was appointed by the President and generally was the leader of a coalition of parties who could form an effective majority in the Reichstag . Beyond that , the implication that Hitler rose to the Chancellorship because a majority of Germans wanted Nazi rule is false as well . Before President Hindenburg appointed Hitler Chancellor in January 1933 , the German people did not show a particular desire to be led either by Hitler or by the Nazi party . These are the results of the March 1932 election for President , the closest Hitler ever came to direct election : Hindenburg 49.6 % , Hitler 30.1 % , Thaelmann 13.2 % , Duesterberg 6.8 % . In the runoff election in April the results were : Hindenburg 53 % , Hitler 36.8 % , Thaelmann 10.2 % . So we can see that Hitler personally was supported by only about a third of German voters . Similarly , the Nazi party never received more than 37 % of the vote in Reichstag elections . That occurred in July 1932 . In the November 1932 election the Nazis *lost* two million votes and 34 seats , down from 230 to 196 out of the 608 in the Reichstag . Comparitively , the Socialists had 121 and the Communists 100 . The Communists had gained 11 seats , and the German National party , which had supported the previous government , had picked up a million of the Nazis ' lost votes to gain 15 seats ( up to 52 ) . I think the other large party was the Catholic Center party ( I do n't know how many seats they had but I think they were declining ) , and there were numerous other small parties . Thus the Nazi vote was on the decline at the time Hitler was appointed Chancellor . What brought Hitler to power was *not* the demand of the German people for Hitler or the Nazis to run things , but the inability of the other parties to put their differences behind them in favor of forming an effective government for the country . Germany did not have an enduring democratic tradition , and their parliamentary system lacked effective center parties that favored the interests of the majority of the population . Instead what they had was a number of small parties who were unable to put aside their own specific objectives in order to combine against the Nazis , who were out to end the democratic process . In fact , part of the problem was that some of the other parties with substantial representation , like the Communists , were also out to end the democratic process , but with different results in mind , and generally did n't mind seeing parliamentary democracy go under . Germany had already had a non-Nazi Chancellor with a majority coalition for five months while the Nazis had been the largest Reichstag party , and there certainly was no danger of a revolution in favor of the Nazis . If anything the Nazis were starting to get desperate because they had failed to get enough support to make Hitler President and their popular vote had begun to decline . Hitler was not Hindenburg 's first choice to be Chancellor , not even his second choice . First , von Papen had been Chancellor since June 1932 . After the November election when the Nazis *lost* seats , Hindenburg first prevailed on von Papen to remain as Chancellor . But there were intrigues behind his back and support for him was lacking . So then Hindenburg turned to von Schleicher , who became Chancellor for two months . Eventually he too was unable to hold together a working coalition of parties to oppose the Nazis , who refused to participate in any government that was not led by a Nazi Chancellor . Some of the Nazi leadership , particularly Gregor Strasser who was the # 2 man in the party at the time , wanted to participate in a coalition government . But others , knowing the party 's support was waning , figured that their best hope to gain power lay in undermining the democratic process . Nevertheless , the country was governed for seven months by Chancellors who were not Nazis , even though the Nazis were the largest Reichstag party . The failure of these men to achieve a working coalition was due to the inability of their coalition parties to work together . Here 's how William Shirer puts it in _The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich_ : The cardinal error of the Germans who opposed Nazism was their failure to unite against it . At the crest of their popular strength , in July 1932 , the National Socialists had attained but 37 percent of the vote . But the 63 percent of the German people who expressed their opposition to Hitler were much too divided and shortsighted to combine against a common danger which they must have known would overwhelm them unless they united , however temporarily , to stamp it out . True , the German people supported Hitler after he became Chancellor . But that does n't change the fact that there was not overwhelming support for him *before* he was in power . The German people were not crying out for Hitler to take over , no matter how bad economic conditions were . The leftist parties ( Socialists/Communists ) probably had more support in total than the Nazis . Hitler used the fact that others were passively or actively willing to see the government paralyzed as a means to taking it over . -- -- - Eric Smith erics @ netcom.com erics @ infoserv.com CI $ : 70262,3610

KS , I see you 're wanting Malcolm 's response . Allow me one last inter- jection then please : Distinguishing among the religious Jews , you 've excepted the Messianic for obvious reasons . Specifically , are you saying it 's these religious Jews , who trace their lineage back to Abraham by blood and orthodoxy , rather than by faith , who wo n't agree ? Orthodox Jews ? As to the a/a ( if I understand your direction ) , the issue remains unproven I suspect , considering how atheists and agnostics so often look to reason . Atheist , it is reasonable to conclude will not agree . For agnostics , a poll seems in order . Who knows ? Myself , I 'm not so sure the atheists can be counted out . For the orthodox , I wonder how many would follow Moses , or Abraham , or David in accepting God 's Word ? Is the particular covenant to which one adheres , more important than God promisimg ? I reckon for many it depends on the ongoing dialogue . Under these considerations , you might understand why I think it 's premature to assert who will and wo n't agree . | -- J -- | | stephen

I , for one , : would *gladly* pay royalties via purchasing secure phones . Hear hear ! I completely agree that we need to work quickly to establish alternatives to the government 's Clinton Clipper . As Brad Templeton and others have noted , once the Clipper becomes ensconced in enough phones there will be enormous pressure to make it the *legal* standard , and it will become the `` market* standard as well . ( There is a lot of confusion in the proposal about whether the use of Clipper is mandated , about whether non-escrow alternatives will be allowed , etc . ) ( There are also unclear issues about how hard , or how illegal , it will be to make `` workalikes '' which meet the standard but which generate phony or untappable keys ... I 'm sure the next several weeks will see these issues thrashed out in this and other groups . ) Meanwhile , I 'd be interested to hear RSA Data Security 's reaction . Often criticized in this group for their licensing policies ( the usual complaints about MailSafe costing too much , at $ 125 or so , and the general issue of software patents ... ) , we may find that *allying* ourselves with RSA is the best thing we can do . What 's a mere licensing fee when our liberty may be at stake ? ( If everyone who wanted true security paid , say , $ 100 for a lifetime use of all of RSA 's patents -- which expire in the period 1998-2002 , or so -- then RSA would make tons of money and be happy , I 'm sure . A small price to pay . For those to whom $ 100 sounds like too much , I 'm sure the actual terms could be different , spread out over several years , whatever . To me , it 's a small price to pay . ) Strong crypto means strong privacy . Escrowing keys , sending copies of keys to large databases , and splitting keys into two 40-bit pieces , all done with secret and non-analyzable protocols and algorithms , is *NOT* strong crypto ! Whatever some of us may think about the abstract principles of patenting number theory applications , this minor issue pales in comparison with the potential dangers of the Clipper proposal ( note that I said `` potential '' ... we 'll presumably learn more in the coming months ) . The RSA algorithms are at least public , have been analyzed and attacked for years , and source code is available ( to better ensure no deliberate weakenesses or trapdoors ) . I know of a number of groups putting together voice encryption systems using off-the-shelf hardware ( like Soundblaster boards for the PC ) and CELP-type software . The new generations of PCs , using fast 486s and Pentiums are fast enough to do real-time voice encryption . Combined with Diffie-Hellman key exchange , this should provide an alternative to the Clipper system . Of course , we do n't really know if the Administration proposes to outlaw competing systems . ( It seems to me that their goal of tapping terrorists , child pornographers , and Hilary bashers would be thwarted if low-cost alternatives to Clipper proliferated . Not to defend child pornographers or terrorists , but limiting basic freedoms to catch a few criminals is not the American way of doing things . End of soapbox mode . ) I suggest we in these groups set aside any differences we may have had with RSA ( and do n't look at me ... .I have both MacPGP *and* a fully legal copy of `` MailSafe '' ! ) and instead work with them as quickly as we can . RSA ? , Jim ? , are you listening ? -Tim May P.S .

If the issue is , `` What are the consequences > if such and such -is- True '' , then Truth is irrelevent . Which is it to > be ? I disagree : every proposition needs a certain amount of evidence and support , before one can believe it . There are a miriad of factors for each individual . As we are all different , we quite obviously require different levels of evidence . As one pointed out , one 's history is important . While in FUSSR , one may not believe a comrade who states that he owns five pairs of blue jeans . One would need more evidence , than if one lived in the United States . The only time such a statement here would raise an eyebrow in the US , is if the individual always wear business suits , etc . The degree of the effect upon the world , and the strength of the claim also determine the amount of evidence necessary . When determining the level of evidence one needs , it is most certainly relevent what the consequences of the proposition are . If the consequences of a proposition is irrelvent , please explain why one would not accept : The electro-magnetic force of attraction between two charged particles is inversely proportional to the cube of their distance apart . Remember , if the consequences of the law are not relevent , then we can not use experimental evidence as a disproof . If one of the consequences of the law is an incongruency between the law and the state of affairs , or an incongruency between this law and any other natural law , they are irrelevent when theorizing about the `` Truth '' of the law . Given that any consequences of a proposition is irrelvent , including the consequence of self-contradiction or contradiction with the state of affiars , how are we ever able to judge what is true or not ; let alone find '' The Truth '' ? By the way , what is `` Truth '' ? Please define before inserting it in the conversation . Please explain what `` Truth '' or `` TRUTH '' is . I do think that anything is ever known for certain . Even if there IS a `` Truth '' , we could never possibly know if it were . I find the concept to be meaningless . -- `` Satan and the Angels do not have freewill .

Ave. , Cambridge , MA 02139 , USA +1 ( 617 ) 876-3296 Lines : 993 NNTP-Posting-Host : life.ai.mit.edu THE WHITE HOUSE Office of the Press Secretary ( Vancouver , British Columbia ) ______________________________________________________________ BACKGROUND BRIEFING BY SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS April 4 , 1993 Canada Place Vancouver , British Columbia 9:40 A.M. PST Folks , we 're about to start the BACKGROUND BRIEFING on the aid package . SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL : Good morning . The President -- President Clinton and President Yeltsin agreed yesterday on a series of American initiatives to support economic and political reform in Russia , and it 's valued at $ 1.6 billion . Before taking your questions and running through the basic outlines of this package , I want to make a few points . First , this is the maximum that the Clinton administration can do with available funds to support Russian reform . All of the funds have been allocated and appropriated by the Congress . There is no need for the administration to go back to the Congress to fund any of these programs . All our Fiscal Year '93 funds currently are available , so in effect , all of these programs can begin tomorrow . The second point is that this package is designed to support Russian reformers . All of the initiatives in the package are directed at reformers and for their benefit , and all have been worked out with prior consultation with the Russian government . Third , the President is determined that we will deliver on these commitments this year . The package is designed to maximize our ability to support reform . In designing it we wanted to avoid making commitments that we could not meet , and we feel very confident that we can meet all of these commitments in front of you . Fourth , I 'd like to note the special importance of trade and investment . I think it 's fair to say that Russia 's capital and technology needs throughout the next decade extend well into the hundreds of billions of dollars . No collection of governments can meet those needs ; only the private sector can do so . And so the President and President Yeltsin agreed to make trade and investment a major priority in the relationship . They also agreed that there would be a new joint commission on energy and space formed , headed on the U.S. side by Vice President Gore ; on the Russian side by Prime Minister Chernomyrdin . And the goal of this effort is to break through the barriers to trade and investment on both sides and to promote a vastly expanded relationship . If it would be helpful I 'd be prepared to run down the first page , which is a summary of U.S. assistance , and just give you some general background on what these programs are . I 'll do it quickly and then I 'll be glad to take questions . The first group of initiatives are humanitarian food and medical assistance . This is part of our effort which has been underway for several years to provide basic humanitarian grant food assistance so that the Russian government can assure there 's at least a minimal amount of bread on the shelves in the major cities . That 's $ 194 million in grant -- that is from Food for Progress , the grant portion of Food for Progress . We 'll also be continuing our grant assistance in medicines and pharmaceutical supplies , and that 's $ 30 million . The second item is concessional food sales . As you know , the United States has had a long-term grain relationship with Russia . It 's important to us and it 's important to Russia that we continue that relationship . The President has chosen the Food for Progress program which is a concessional loan program . The value over the next seven months is $ 700 million . These are concessional terms . The exact terms have not been worked out , but I think it 's fair to say there will be a grace period on principal of six or seven years , and concessional rates thereafter for the life of the deal . The third program is a collection of private sector support . We think this is one of the most important things we 're going to do . Privatization and the creation of small businesses is the number one priority of the reform government in Moscow . And so the President has decided to create a Russian-American enterprise fund capitalized this year at $ 50 million . And the goal of this fund is to make direct loans to small businesses in Russia , to take equity positions in those businesses . The President has also decided to create a privatization fund which would work directly with the Russian government in its priority objective of trying to convert state enterprises from a state-owned basis to a private basis . He has also agreed -- the President has also agreed to establish a Eurasia foundation . This would be a private foundation led by prominent Americans to fund democratization projects in Russia . The fourth grouping you see there in the summary page is democratization itself . I think it 's fair to say that this administration has given a new impetus to the goal of pursuing democratization in Russia . You see that we have a total of $ 48 million in programs , various programs . The detailed tables give an indication of some of the programs that we 're launching . The President is also calling for the development of a democracy corps , which will be an overarching umbrella group to try to incorporate all of the disparate private and public efforts now underway from the United States to support reform in Russia . The fifth program you see is Russian office of resettlement . This is a new initiative created and conceptualized by this administration . This is a demonstration project . What we 'd like to do is work with the Russian military to help resettle Russian officers returning from the Baltic states and other parts of the former Soviet Union . We want to make sure that we work out the best way to do that , whether it 's with Russian labor and Russian materials or using prefab American construction . And so we 've decided to fund on a demonstration basis the construction of 450 housing units . We 'll be working very closely with the Russian military on this . And I would say that we have a long-term commitment to this project . The sixth area is energy in the environment . They are two issues that the President feels strongly about . Our initial efforts will be feasibility studies to look into the possibility of enhancing their energy production , both oil and gas ; and equally important trying to cut down on the leakages in the oil and gas pipeline systems , which cause so much environmental damage . I 've talked a little bit about trade and investment , about the new group being created that the Vice President will chair on our side . Secretary Ron Brown will also be cochairing with Deputy Prime Minister Shohkin , a business development committee , which will work in all other sectors of the economy , to break down the many barriers that currently exist and impede trade and investment . We are also going to appoint a full-time investment ombudsman in the American government to work on this problem full-time . And the point I 'd like to make here is , trade and investment in the 1990s is every bit as important , to draw an analogy , as arms reductions was in the '70s and '80s . And we just thought that in looking at this we needed to make a commitment within our own government to have people work on it -- senior people on a full-time basis , because it is terribly important . You 'll notice that the United States is going to support Russia 's membership in the GATT . Russia has had observer status . Russia has requested our support and , in fact , requested our advice in becoming a member of the GATT . We think that the long-term goal of drawing Russia into the global economy is paramount , a very important goal . And that is why we are supporting the membership in the GATT . We are also supporting their access to GSP , the Generalized System of Preferences . You 'll note that Ex-Im has extended $ 82 million in credit for a caterpillar deal in Siberia , that OPIC has extended $ 150 million in credits and loan guarantees for a Conoco oil project . I 'd like to emphasize that we are very close to an agreement between Russia and the United States for a $ 2-billion framework facility through the Ex-Im Bank that would finance Russian purchases of American oil and gas equipment and services . We think this is a very important development . We think we 'll get there by April 14th , which is the opening day of the Tokyo conference , the G-7 conference . Before I take any further questions , I 'd like to defer to my colleague , who will review the security assistance objectives with you . SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL : Our major unfinished agenda with the Russians and with their counterparts in Ukraine , Kazakhstan and Belarus is in the area of the safe and secure dismantlement of the nuclear arsenals on their territory under the terms of the START I and START II agreements . Recently we completed in Moscow three , I think , very important agreements that devote a significant chunk of Nunn-Lugar funding to three important programs . The first is the program of $ 130 million for the strategic nuclear delivery vehicle dismantlement program . That is for submarines , for ICBM dismantlement and for bomber dismantlement -- $ 130 million . The second is a $ 75 million tranche of funding for the construction of a facility to store nuclear materials removed from the warheads as they are dismantled . This will essentially contribute to the overall design and the early phases of the construction of that storage facility . And finally , a $ 10-million tranche of money to help in the establishment of a monitoring system for the nuclear materials as they are withdrawn from the weapons system . So we add that $ 215-million total to the extant Nunn-Lugar assistance which has been flowing -- about $ 150 million for some overall safety improvements for various kinds of equipment and safety measures that we have been working out with the Russians over the last couple of years . So this is an area where we will be going a lot more work with not only the Russians but with the Ukrainians , Kazhaks , and Belarussians . Belarus , for example , has just , in the last couple of weeks , received up to $ 65 million in FY'93 funds for safety , security and dismantlement programs on Belarussian territory . And this was in the wake of their ratification of START I , an agreement to accede to NPT . So we are working very hard with all the parties to the Lisbon protocols , and will continue to work very hard with them . And I look upon these three recent agreements with Russia as a very important step in that process . Q The OPIC funds to -- is that for the field in Kazhakstan -- and Conoco already signed this deal with Kazhakstan . Why do you feel now it is necessary -- if it 's the same one , why do you feel it 's necessary ? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL : It 's not the same deal . Chevron signed a deal with Kazhakstan , the Tenges oil field . This is a new investment project . It 's a polar lights oil development and renovation project , and it 's being announced today . So it 's completely new . Q Can you tell us more about what 's involved ? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL : Yes . Conoco , like other American oil companies has been searching for ways to do two things . One , to prospect for new oil in Siberia , west Siberia ; and two , to try to get into the business of renovating oil wells and renovating pipelines , both oil and gas , in Russia . The objective here , obviously , is to take advantage of the natural resources in Russia , increase energy production , which will , in turn , increase hard currency revenues , which is what Russia needs . So we think this deal is very , very good development for Russia . The Russians do as well , and it 's good for an American company . And the American government has played a leading role in pulling this together through the credit facility in OPIC and through the loan guarantee . Q So it 's to search and also to renovate fields that are already there ? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL : That 's right . Q On that point , should other American companies expect to get administration support for such deals , or should they now go to the Ex-Im and try to get the money out of the $ 2 billion ? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL : Well , as you know , Ex-Im is part of the U.S. government and various parts of the U.S. government have been pushing , including the State Department and the White House for this deal to be consummated . And we think it will . And if we arrive at this agreement by April 14th , there will be $ 2 billion in financing available for American companies to sell their equipment and sell their services . Q That should take up all of the rest of the deals and their wo n't be -- and their will or there wo n't be support for OPIC sort of deals such as this Conoco ? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL : There 's a tremendous amount of interest on the part of American oil and gas companies to invest in Russia . We think that the Ex-Im oil and gas facility , the $ 2-billion facility , once it is concluded , will soak up a lot of that interest . But I think the interest may even extend beyond that . And if so , the government will respond . Q What 's the current year budget costs of that $ 2-billion agreement should it go forward ? And is there any current year budget costs -- SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL : I 'll have to refer you to Ex-Im for that . I do n't know the details of that . Q The concessional food sales -- is there any current year costs to that , or is it delayed until the years in which the payments are due ? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL : The concessional food sales are from Food for Progress , which is a USDA program . USDA has the funds , we do n't need to go back to the Congress to expend those funds . There will be a hit in the budget . I 'd refer you to USDA and OMB for the details on that . Q Can you talk about the Democracy Corps ? Q and the private sector -- how many folks are going to be involved in that ? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL : Why do n't I start with the Democracy Corps first . I think the administration felt coming into office that there were literally thousands of organization , private organizations in the United States that in one way or another were working at the goal of trying to achieve democratization in Russia , helping on a farmer-to-farmer basis . And there were literally 10 or 15 U.S. government agencies that had a variety of programs in this area . And so the administration felt -- the President felt it was important to try to draw all of these initiatives together under one group to give some coherence to the efforts and to give some impetus to the efforts . And so this is a presidential initiative . It will be headed by Ambassador Tom Simons who will soon take up his duties as the coordinator for U.S. assistance in the former Soviet Union . And we 're very hopeful that we might use this Democracy Corps not only to draw upon the resources of our own government , but the resources of the American private sector and schools and communities across the nation . Q any kind of commitment yet , any kind of word yet on FY'94 , and any new money that needs to be appropriated besides the $ 300 million the President talked about ? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL : The administration is requesting additional funds in FY'94 of $ 700 million . What the President has done this weekend is to consult really intensively yesterday with President Yeltsin about additional measures the United States could take in some of these areas to support reform . He 'll be consulting with the Congress . When he returns to Washington , he 'll be consulting also with the other ally governments , and we 'll make a decision at that time . Q Two questions about the $ 700 billion agricultural money . First of all , I thought it was the sort of consensus that what Russia did not need was more loans for food . So why did you decide to do it that way ? Secondly , could you explain -- agriculture has been stopped from making further loans for food because of Russia 's inability to pay . How does this fit into that situation ? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL : As you know , the United States for a long time has been a major supplier of grains and food commodities , agricultural products to Russia . I think between 1991 and '92 we had extended -- a little bit of history here -- about $ 5.5 billion in credits , credit guarantees , through the Commodity Credit Corporation . That was the principal vehicle to ensure the sale of American grain products . On December 1 of last year , '92 , the Russian government stopped its payments on that program . They are now in arrears to us on that program , and therefore , by law , the United States can not continue that program . And so the President , working with Secretary Espy and other officials in the Cabinet , looked for other ways that we could promote American grain sales . And I think we have two ways to do that . We 've announced today $ 194 million in grant food assistance through the Food for Progress program . But we do not have sufficient authority to spend $ 700 million in grant food , and so we looked for a concessional loan program . I think everybody agrees that Russia -- that a short-term loan program for Russia would not make sense now , but a long-term concessional loan program would . And that is what this program is . It will provide , once the final details are worked out , for a six to seven-year grace period on payments of principal . And then from years seven through 15 , which is the life of the deal , it will provide for concessional rates of interest -- generally around three to four percent . And so we believe and the Russian government believes this is a good deal for them because it will avoid the imperative of early payments and put them into the out years , but it will also continue this very important grain relationship , which is important for them , and it 's important for the American farm community . Q I gather from what you say that this could make it explicit -- the Russians ' failure to pay the interest on ECC loan does not in any way affect this kind of loan going through , is that right ? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL : Let me be explicit about that . We are prevented under the law to from continuing the Commodity Credit Corporation short-term credit program because of Russia 's arrearages to the United States . All of you know about those arrearages . They total about , I think , around $ 640 million . USDA can give you an exact figure . So having taken that into consideration and wanting to preserve American market share and a long-term grain relationship , wanting to respond to a specific request from the Russian government for major food assistance , knowing that we could n't take it from the grant programs because we do n't have sufficient authority there , we looked at Food for Progress , which is a program we 've used to great effect in other parts of the world . And we consulted with the Russian government and arrived at this solution . I think the Russians are pleased because it provides them with the food , but also gives them a little bit of relief on the short-term payments . Q Where do those funds actually come from ? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL : They come from the Food for Progress program , which is a program under USDA 's authority . USDA has the authority to spend these funds . We do not need to go back to the Congress for these funds . And I want to make that general point again : Everything in this package , the $ 1.6 billion package , comprises funds that have already been allocated and appropriated by the Congress . The administration can begin to spend these monies tomorrow . And it 's very important in our eyes that we expend all the funds this year , that we meet these commitments . And we are confident we 'll be able to do so . Q How did you arrive at the figure of $ 700 million -- does that max out that program , or did you actually have a range from 0 to -- SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL : There 's a reason for it . The reason was that the Russian government told us that 's about the amount of grain that they needed between now and harvest time . And so the idea is that we would begin the shipments probably $ 100 million per month from now until the harvest in the autumn , at which time Russia wo n't require the same level of food imports from the West . Q I would imagine there 's going to be some considerable envy and jealousy on the part of some of the other republics because of the size and the scope of this with Russia . Have you given any consideration to advancing negotiations for the same kinds of projects with the Ukraine , with Georgia , with some of the other republics ? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL : Yes , we 're very conscience of the fact that we also have an interest in extending American support to the 11 other countries of the former Soviet Union . We have told ourselves , and we have planned that in the area of technical assistance , the grant technical assistance that you see , roughly 50 percent of the funding will go to Russia and roughly 50 percent to the other countries . In the area of food sales , we have been active with Ukraine , in grant food assistance with Georgia and Armenia . We will continue that . And I think it 's fair to say that after this summit we will go back and look at all of our programs with the other countries to ensure that they are adequate and they are productive and they 're hard-hitting . Q Has anything happened at the summit to lead American energy companies and other companies to believe that Russia is going to be more user-friendly toward them in terms of taxing , legalities , bureaucracy ? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL : Well , one of our primary objectives coming into this summit was to highlight , not only the economic agenda , but also trade and investment . And I 'd like to refer to the point I made at the beginning . We 're convinced in talking about this problem -- the problem of how to support Russia long-term -- we 're convinced that no collection of Western governments have the financial resources over the next decade to fuel the continuation of reform , that only the private sector can do that . We look at our own society and we see tremendous capability in resources in the oil and gas sector . It is a very good match with what the Russians need now , which is financial investment in the existing oil and gas wells and pipeline and new technology and new capital to finance new production . That 's what the Russian government has told us it wants to do , and so that 's why we have made such a major emphasis on it . That 's why trade and investment was a prominent issue on the first day of these talks , and in fact , figured prominently last night in the meeting between President Yeltsin and President Clinton . And we 're hoping that together we might send a strong signal to the American business community that we support their efforts to invest in Russia , that the United States , through Ex- Im and OPEC and the Department of Commerce , will be there to support them . Q My question is , is Yeltsin in any position to deliver on making Russia a more -- SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL : We think he is . I would note that President Yeltsin 's Prime Minister , Mr. Chernomyrdin , worked for 30 years in the Russian oil and gas sector . He will now chair a high-level commission with the Vice President , Vice President Gore , to try to break through the barriers that currently exist to Western investment in the oil and gas sector . We believe we have a commitment to make that committee an important committee . And we 're looking forward to the work . Q What type of mechanism is already in place to administer the private sector portion of the program ? And will the U.S. be directly involved in the tail end of distribution of the actual funds or is the money simply turned over to the Russian government for distribution at their will ? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL : Are you talking about the variety of programs listed here ? It depends on the program itself . In most cases , though , we are either working through American PBOs or American government agencies to ensure that the money obviously is well spent , that the money gets to the intended source . That 's an obligation we have to the Congress to ensure the money is well spent and that we can account for the money . We have done that in the last couple of months intensively and we will continue to do it for each of these programs . But they are all quite different . For instance , in the area of grant food and medical assistance , for grant food it is carried out through USDA and USDA accounts for the delivery of the food . For grant medical assistance , we 've been working through Project Hope which is a private organization . For the housing -- for instance , the resettlement of Russian officers , we 'll be working with a group of American PBOs . On some of the democratization projects , we 're working directly with Russian private individuals and private foundations . We 're working with journalists in Russia on a media project that you may have noticed . So we literally have here 30 to 40 different activities under all these rubrics and they 're all going to be carried out in slightly different ways . Some directly with the Russian government , some with Russian citizens . Q The Jackson-Vanik restrictions that remain and on the COCOM restrictions that remain , can you tell us what the President has to do on that ? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL : Well , as George noted yesterday , President Yeltsin raised these as irritants in the relationship . The President has noted that . I think it 's fair to say we will go back now in our own government when we return to Washington and look at both of these questions , and we 'll get back to the Russian government . Q You were not prepared for these questions when you got here ? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL : We were prepared for these questions . We 've looked at them . But we 're not prepared to make a quick decision this weekend . They require -- let me just explain , particularly on Jackson-Vanik . They require consultation with the Congress . They require consultation with the American Jewish community . And we 're very sensitive to those concerns . And so we 'll want to go back and talk to them before we take any action . Q Is this package designed so that you will not have to go to Congress for anything at this point ? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL : As I said at the beginning , the advantage of this particular package is that all the funds have been allocated and appropriated by the Congress . So the administration will not have to go back to the Congress to seek any additional authority to fund any of these efforts . In effect , they can all begin tomorrow , and I know that many of the agencies responsible for these projects will begin tomorrow . And that 's the advantage of this particular initiative . Q If this , as the President says , is a long-term , long-haul thing , and members of Congress are at this moment heading for Moscow , why are n't you talking about going to Congress and suggesting to the President of Russia that you are prepared to go to Congress for various things ? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL : I think we 've been clear about that . The President is discussing this weekend with President Yeltsin some additional ideas that we have for American funding of additional projects , and ideas that he has . We have a major congressional delegation that left last night , headed by Representative Gephardt and we 'll want to consult with that delegation and other members of Congress before doing anything . And we 'll also want to consult with our allies . So that 's where it stands now . Q We 've been told repeatedly that a number of these items represent different or new ways of spending the money already appropriated . Could you just tick off which of these items represents reprogramming or at least spending money in ways that it was not previously set to be ? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL : I think that we 've said that these are all projects that either Congress had allocated money for through the Freedom Support Act ; there were some funds that were left over from FY'92 . And this administration took office and had some new ideas about how the funds might be expended . We did n't use just the Freedom Support Act funds or the FY'92 funds . We went into some of the agency allocations -- Ex-Im , OPIC , and USDA -- and tried to look for creative ways to further our programs . And example of that is the Food for Progress concessional loans . We had hit a brick wall with another type of funding through USDA . We could not go forward legally , and so we looked for a more creative way to ensure continued American market share and ensure continued grain sales , and we think we found it . Q Where , for example , are you getting the money for this Russian officer resettlement -- SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL : That 's from the Freedom Support Act funds . Q In other words , all of the money is being directly spent in new ways , so to speak -- SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL : Most of the grant projects that you see -- if you look at the general chart , the second chart , it 's broken down into grant and credits . And if you look under grants , the technical cooperation projects that total $ 281.9 million -- that is almost all Freedom Support Act funding . A little bit of it is leftover funds from fiscal year '92 . The Nunn-Lugar funds , of course , you know about the legislative history of those funds . Q cooperation -- SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL : From FY '92 ? I do n't have the exact figure . It was not a considerable figure . Q Could you tell us please , has anything happened here this weekend that will break the log jam between Ukraine and Russia over START -- for START I and II as a result of what 's happened here -- SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL : Both presidents , President Yeltsin and President Clinton , will be discussing this issue this morning . In fact , we have n't yet gotten to security and arms control related issues . That will be this morning 's session . I know that President Clinton will be very strongly reinforcing that this is a top priority for us . We 've been talking to the Russians and the Ukrainians over the last couple of weeks about ways that we might help to facilitate the discussions between them . Up to this point , this has been a very important negotiation that 's been going on essentially between Moscow and Kiev . And we are at the point now of essentially discussing with them if there are ways that we could contribute to this discussion , help to move things forward essentially . But in terms of what is coming out of this weekend , I do n't yet know . In a couple hours we 'll know . Q ? Just a follow-up on the financing here . Is any of this robbing Peter to pay Boris -- since it 's all current year appropriations , have you taken it from anyplace that 's been earmarked and put it into this fund ? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL : There are smoke and mirrors here , and I think it 's an important point to note . We could have given you a page of assistance numbers that included out-year funding . We 're going to make a long-term commitment to many of these projects -- for instance , the enterprise funds , the privatization effort , the housing effort . And we 've already talked to the Russians about our long-term commitment . We could have put in really big numbers and this could have been a bigger package , but we wanted to make a point : This package is FY '93 . It 's funds that we have . And we 're going to do what we say we 're going to do . And the President feels very strongly about that . In the past there is a legacy that the western governments , the combination of governments , put up large budget figures and for any number of reasons we 're not able to meet them , we 're determined , and the President is determined , to carry out every single program in this package . And we 'll do it . But we do have a longer-term commitment , and that 's part of the discussions on economics this weekend . We 're looking for Russian ideas on what it is we can do to most effectively support reform . And we 've told them that we do have a commitment on some of these programs beyond this fiscal year . Q taken it way from any -- SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL : No , we have n't . Okay , the question is , have we reprogrammed any of these funds ; so have we taken it from other countries to pay for programs in Russia ? The answer is no , we have not done so . Q In terms of funding , there is no available monies left -- and you simply find a creative way to find money somewhere else . Does n't that , in fact , support the -- theory ? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL : Not at all . I do n't think it does . That 's a particular example , and the example is grain sales . The Commodity Credit Corporation credit guarantee program was short-term loans that Russia had to pay back within 12 to 15 months . You all know about Russia 's debt problem , and Russia was unable to meet those commitments . So we looked for a way to do two things : to meet Russia 's requirement for grain . They 're a net grain importer on a massive scale , and also meet our objective of making sure that the American farmers have a chance to sell their products to Russia . And we simply look for another way to finance that . And we have legislative authority to do it . This program has been successful in other areas . We had not tried it before in the former Soviet Union , but we thought we should now . Q Is n't this really the Bush-Clinton aid package for Russia , since these funds were really first derived by initiatives put forward by President Bush ? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL : No , I do n't think that 's a fair characterization . A lot of these funds were appropriated by the U.S. Congress is 1991 , in 1992 . This administration took office and inherited some obligations that the Bush administration had made . But we had a long six to seven week review of this program . We decided to meet the commitments that had been made by the previous administration . But we have gone well beyond them in funding the enterprise fund , which was just an idea , but the idea had not been filled out with a program . There was no number attached to it . In grouping together some projects and trying to make them into a coherent whole in the privatization effort , I would say , is another Clinton initiative . Further , we listened to the Russian government and listened to the Russian military who told us that the resettlement of their officers was important to them for political and economic and social reasons . And President Clinton has responded to that . And we are making a long-term commitment that beyond this demonstration project we 're going to figure out a way to do much more in trying to settle those officers . I would also say that the President has given impetus to all of us in the agencies to think much more broadly about what it is we can do on democratization , because there we have some experience and some comparative advantage that lends itself to the Russian experience . And in calling for the creation of a democracy corps , which is another new initiative , we 're hopeful that we can take the resources of the private sector as well as the American government , to achieve that objective . So I would not characterize it that way at all . And as most of you know , I am a career civil servant . I was in the last administration . I 'm very familiar with what the last administration did . And I would characterize this as a Clinton assistance package for Russia . Q There 's been a lot of criticism that aid in the past has not gotten to the people . Is there anything in this outside of the ombudsman , that will guarantee that this money will not just disappear because it 's being administered by the Russian government ? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL : I think that -- I know that the President and other senior officials of our government are concerned that American money be spent wisely and that it get to the source that it 's intended -- for which it 's intended . And so we 're going to take great care -- AID and the State Department will take great care in making sure that the funds are expended properly and that they 're reaching their source . I would not that this package is not simply a package of support solely to the Russian government . Some of these projects , especially in democratization and exchanges , are going to be worked out directly with Russian private individuals , with businesses . The private enterprise support is another example of that . SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL : If I could just add a word on this point with regard to the SSD-related programs , one area that we 've been looking at very , very closely is consideration of actually using Russian firms in subcontracting for these kinds of programs . They would be working very closely , of course , with the American firms , who would be the prime contractors . But this is a fine example , I think , of a more -- of a imaginative and flexible approach toward getting some of that funding down to the grassroots level , down to the ground in Russia ; but at the same time ensuring that it is spent efficiently and for the purposes for which it was intended . Q When would the democracy corps start ? Exactly when do you see this happening ? How would get it off the ground ? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL : Well , the President is today calling for the creation of a democracy corps . I think it 's fair to say that we 're going to work out its framework over the next couple of weeks . Ambassador Simons takes up his duties on May 1st . But in effect we 've already started , because over the last couple of weeks the administration has begun to reach out to people in the private sector who have come to us asking us to help facilitate their activities in Russia . And we 've said that we will be helpful . We 've also tried to kind of coordinate in a much more effective way the activities of our own government . We do have 10 or 15 agencies that are active in Russia in one way or another . We think it makes sense to draw them together and to focus their efforts . Q Excuse me . How much of this $ 1.6 billion will actually be spent in the United States by American made goods ? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL : I do n't have any figures for you now , but perhaps we could try to work something up in the next couple of days on that . Q This figure is larger than the figure that has been in the press -- did this program grow yesterday as a result of the discussions , or have we just been that far off the mark ? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL : No , I think -- unfortunately the press has been a little bit off the mark , and I 'm sorry to say that . No , this package -- President Clinton put us to work about seven weeks ago on this package . And he was briefed intensively on this . He contributed a lot of the intellectual leadership in this package . He contributed a lot of the ideas in the package . And I think it 's fair to say that we had this rough package worked out about two weeks ago . We have been refining it ever since . We spent a couple of days last week going over it with the Russian government , both the embassy in Washington and the government in Moscow through our own embassy . And so it 's been evolving . But this particular package has been together for about two weeks . Q Where is Yeltsin 's input into this then ? There was so much talk before about the President wanted to get Yeltsin 's views about specifically what was needed and so forth . Is that in the out years ? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL : No , it 's both . President Yeltsin has on several occasions told us , for instance , that support for the creation of private businesses is important to him ; that the resettlement of Russian military officers is important ; and that first and foremost the effort to privatize the state industries is important to them . And so what we did was to try to make those the centerpiece of our technical assistance part o the package . We listened to him . On the privatization effort , we have been working with the Russian government for months on this trying to work out all the details . So the Russian government on most of these programs was involved every step of the way . But let me get at the other part of your question . The President is also using this weekend to talk about a broader set of initiatives that we might undertake . And we 're looking for his ideas . The President has brought his own ideas to the table -- for instance , on energy and the environment and in housing . But we 're looking for Russian ideas not . We need to consult with the Congress ; and we need to consult with the other allied governments that are also active . Q There 's essentially nothing that happened in the last day and a half that measurably altered the package that you came in with ? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL : This particular package , as I said , was worked out and was ready about two weeks ago . We have since then consulted with the Russian government on the final stages of its development , and so this weekend we 've primarily talked about future , about what more the United States and other Western countries can do to support reform in Russia , which is our base objective here . Q I noticed that you -- that money appropriated to train bankers and businessmen and officers . Can you tell me what about job training for workers who are displaced by privatization ? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL : You 're right ; we have a program to train Russian -- young Russians in banking and financial services in the United States . Part of the housing initiative , it 's not just to build housing units , it 's to retrain Russian officers who are retiring into other professions . Q money for job training for workers whose jobs are disappearing because of privatization -- SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL : We have not yet allocated any money for that . Q Why not ? Q of the $ 6 million is going to build 450 housing units . Is n't that a lot of money per unit given what the Western dollar will buy in the former Soviet Union ? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL : If you want to do housing the right way , it 's not just the building the framework of a house , you 've got to think about all the utilities . You 've got to think about the purchase of land . You 've got to think about sewage and gas and electricity and so forth . And it 's also retraining . It 's not enough to put retired -- an officer coming out of -- Riga or Tallin or Vilnius in a house in western Russia . We think we have an obligation to try to retrain those officers as well . This is responding to a request from the Russian government . Q of the $ 6 million will go to retrain -- SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL : That 's right . Q Are you talking about apartment buildings or single -- SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL : We 're talking about single , individual dwellings . Q You 're saying that only 450 families will be served by this ? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL : What I want to -- I thought I pointed out earlier , this is a demonstration project . What we did n't want to do -- given the experience that the Germans and the Turks and the Italians have had in building housing in western Russian , we did not want to leap into it with a huge amount of money . What we want to do is work over the next couple of months and try to figure out with American organizations in the private sector the best way to get this job done . I noted that we have a long-term commitment to that . And so I would expect that we would put a lot more money into this in the future . But we want to do it wisely ; we want to spend the money wisely . Q What is it about this program that convinces you that it will protect Russia 's reforms and that Russia will be in a position to may back the money they 're supposed to pay back , especially considering their other debt problem ? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL : Well , look , I think it 's important to note that the United States on its own does not have the capability to fuel a continuation of Russian reform . It 's got to be a collective Western effort , and we 're looking to our allies to do more as well . But beyond that , it 's really what the Russians do that is going to decide the fate of reform . We can simply play a role , and we feel we have an obligation to do so , which is consistent with our national interests . Q Did the President say that the value of the U.S. contribution was that it would create security and prosperity for the United States ? So what is it about this program that does this ? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL : I think you have to go back to the fundamental objective of our policy toward Russia , and that is we want to do everything we can to support the continuation of reform . We are convinced that if reformers stay in power , then we 'll be able to continue the drawdown of nuclear forces , foreign policy cooperation and economic interaction , which are the three benefits to the United States from reform in Russia . So it 's not a simple question . You ca n't just say that this program is the answer . It 's a long-term question and we have to make a long-term commitment to it . Q And then on the question of Russia 's ability to repay , what convinces you they 'll be able to pay seven to 15 years from now ? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL : Well , the Russian government has made a commitment to repay , and what we 're hoping is that if reform continues , and if they can continue to improve their oil and gas sector and earn additional hard currency revenues , that Russia will be in a position six or seven years from now to pay back those loans . Q substantial government-to-government loan we 've ever gotten into with the Russians ? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL : I do n't want to answer authoritatively on that . I do n't go back 20 or 30 years on this . But in the last four or five years , yes it is , because the previous way that we financed grain exports was really to just ensure private bank loans . This is a different type of effort . Q government loans in any other sector that you recall ? I know it was n't done in -- SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL : I think it 's fair to say this is a new and unique effort . END10:25 A.M. PDT

How can anyone believe in such a sorry document as the bible ? If you want to be religious are n't there more plausable books out there ? Seriously , the bible was written by multiple authors who repeatedly contradict each other . One minute it tells you to kill your kid if he talks back and the next it says not to kill at all . I think that if xtians really want to follow a deity they should pick one that can be consistent , unlike the last one they invented . For people who say Jesus was the son of god , did n't god say not to EVER put ANYONE else before him ? Looks like you did just that . Did n't god say not to make any symbols or idols ? What are crosses then ? Do n't you think that if you do in fact believe in the bible that you are rather far off track ? Was Jesus illiterate ? Why did n't he write anything ? Anyone know ? I honestly hope that people who believe in the bible understand that it is just one of the religious texts out there and that it is one of the poorer quality ones to boot .

In general , there are > no dietary limitations in patients with Crohn 's except as they relate > to obstruction . There is no evidence that any foods will bring on > recurrence of Crohn 's . Interesting statements , simply because I have been told otherwise . I'm certainly not questioning Steve 's claims , as for one I am not a doctor , and I agree that foods do n't bring on the recurrence of Crohn 's . But inflammation can be either mildly or DRASTICALLY enhanced due to food . Having had one major obstruction resulting in resection ( is that a good enough caveat : - ) , I was told that a *LOW RESIDUE* diet is called for . Basically , the idea is that if there is inflammation of the gut ( which may not be realized by the patient ) , any residue in the system can be caught in the folds of inflammation and constantly irritate , thus exacerbating the problem . Therefore , anything that does n't digest completely by the point of common inflammation should be avoided . With what I 've been told is typical Crohn 's , of the terminal ileum , my diet should be low residue , consisting of : Completely out - never again - items : o corn ( kernel husk does n't digest ... most of us know this : - ) o popcorn ( same ) o dried ( dehydrated ) fruit and fruit skins o nuts ( Very tough when it comes to giving up some fudge : - ) Discouraged greatly : o raw vegetables ( too fibrous ) o wheat and raw grain breads o exotic lettuce ( iceberg is ok since it 's apparently mostly water ) o greens ( turnip , mustard , kale , etc ... ) o little seeds , like sesame ( try getting an Arby 's without it ! ) o long grain and wild rice ( husky ) o beans ( you 'll generate enough gas alone without them ! ) o BASICALLY anything that requires heavy digestive processing I was told that the more processed the food the better ! ( rather ironic in this day and age ) . The whole point is PREVENTATIVE ... you want to give your system as little chance to inflame as possible . I was told that among the NUMEROUS things that were heavily discouraged ( I only listed a few ) , to try the ones I wanted and see how I felt . If it 's bad , do n't do it again ! Remember though that this was while I was in remission . For Veggies : cook the daylights out of them . I prefer steaming ... I think it 's cooks more thoroughly - you 're mileage may vary .

'' I hate to pour cold water on this , but currently seawater extracted uranium , even using the new , improved fiber absorbers from Japan , is about 20 times more expensive than uranium on the spot market . Uranium is *very* cheap right now , around $ 10/lb . Right now , there are mines closing because they ca n't compete with places like Cigar Lake in Canada ( where the ore is so rich they present safety hazards to the mines , who work in shielded vehicles ) . Plenty of other sources ( for example , uranium from phosphate processing ) would come on line before uranium reached $ 200/lb . `` Demand and supply balance will collapse '' is nonsense . Supply and demand always balance ; what changes is the price . Is uranium going to increase in price by a factor of 20 by the end of the century ? Not bloody likely . New nuclear reactors are not being built at a sufficient rate . Uranium from seawater is interesting , but it 's a long term project , or a project that the Japanese might justify on grounds of self-sufficiency . Paul F. Dietz dietz @ cs.rochester.edu

Your comparison with the Warsaw Ghetto uprising is insulting , and racist beyond belief . The attempts to quiet any violence in the Gaza Strip are just that . The efforts to quell murder and mayhem in the Gaza strip were the resluts of violence and came AFTER the violence . It was not an arbitrary racial move like the nazi treatment of Jews . Jews had NOT committed acts of violence and murder as have the residents of Gaza . I find your eagerness to ignore the acts of murder nothing more than anti-Israel bigotry . > The Gaza strip , this tiny area of land with the highest population > density in the world , has been cut off from the world for weeks . > The Israeli occupier has decided to punish the whole population of > Gaza , some 700.000 people , by denying them the right to leave the > strip and seek work in Israel . It is NOT punishment , but protection from repeated attacks by residents of Gaza . You self-servingly omit any references to WHY Israel has had to take action . Apparaently the deaths of innocent Israeli civilians do not enter into your equation , a racist ommission on your part . > While Polish non-Jews risked their lives to save Jews from the > Ghetto , no Israeli Jew is known to have risked his life to help > the Gazan resistance .

A population denied basic human rights is entitled to > rise up against its tormentors . The right of Israel to protect its citizens from murderers is also recognized by international law . Israeli civilians have been getting stabbed to death on a daily basis . If this wave of murder does not matter to you , then your posturing for the basic human rights you claim matter so much to you is nothing but an anti-Israel charade . > As is known , the Israeli regime is considering Gazans unworthy of > Israeli citizenship and equal rights in Israel , although they are > considered worthy to do the dirty work in Israeli hotels , shops > and fields . Do you know of residents of Gaza who have applied for Israeli citizenship and were denied ? I have heard of no such denials taking place . Can you document this , or is this more of your stupid and innacurate propaganda ? The truth is that if Gazan residents applied for citizenship , HAMAS would murder them as collaborators . Many Gazans are born in towns and villages located in > Israel . They may not live there , for these areas are reserved for > the Master Race . How dare you use such a disgusting phrase . How very easy you attack a people , when you omit facts which fly in the face of your pure racism . Perhaps you are judging a people to be the racists that you are . Do you believe that all Jews must have the same bigoted makeup as you ? Here 's another little fly in your ointment , about the 'master race , ' for you to avoid ... Two months ago a plane with 86 Bosnian Muslims left Bosnia to seek asylum in the middle east . Four Arab nations refused to grant them asylum . Then when Israli Arabs agreed to take the responsibility for them , they were allowed into Israel . Yes , Israel . But when the plane landed , the Israeli Arabs who had previously agreed to take care of them refused to be involved with the rescue project , because they felt that it would make Israel look good . It was more important to avoid any good PR for Israel than to take care of fellow Muslims . Israel moved them to a kibbutz , where they are safe and secure . The truth is that time after time the Islamic world has turned its back on Muslims in need more than Israel has . Even in the case of the 400 deportees , Lebanon was willing to let their so-called Arab brothers freeze to death rather than give them sanctuary in Lebanon . Nearly twice as many Palestinians have been murdered by other Palestinians than in confrontations with Israel . Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians had been deported from Kuwait , just because they were Palestinian . The truth is that your phoney concern for the welfare of the Palestinians is nothing but an excuse to attack Israel . You are part of the ignorant effort to confine all concern for the welfare of the Palestinians to attacking Israel . But the truth is there are greater reasons than Israel for the plight of the Palestinians . To disregard Jordan or Kuwait or Saudi Arabia or any of the other oil-rich nations who do nothing for these people , is to use the plight of these poor people as a vehicle for your hatred of Jews , or your hatred of Israel . Anti-semitism and anti-Zionism is NOT the same as pro-Palestinian and anyone who insists that it is the same really does not give two hoots for their welfare . > The Nazi regime accorded to the residents of the Warsaw ghetto the > right to self- administration . They selected Jews to pacify the > occupied population and preventing any form of resistance . Some > Jewish collaborators were killed . Israel also wishes to rule over > Gaza through Arab collaborators . Your pathetic analogy is so absent of relevant fact that your racism can not be disguised . Jews had never declared war on a Polish people . Jews had never attacked Poles with knives , or had used the Ghetto as a staging ground for attacks . To take something like the Warsaw Ghetto ( the creation of which you do not even bother to discuss ! ) and the uprising that followed is to degrade the dead , and to show that intelligent debate on a difficult situation is beyond your intellectual purview . You clearly have never even read a single word of the Covenant of the Islamic Resistance Movement . Here is arguably the single most anti-semitic genocidal document since Mein Kampf , yet it is totally disregarded in your rantings . Your racism is most evident in your eagerness to avoid such documentation . If it were considered , you might actually have to deal with mideast problems in a balanced manner , rather than in an anti-semitic manner . > As Israel denies Gazans the only two options which are compatible > with basic human rights and international law , that of becoming > Israeli citizens with full rights or respecting their right for > self-determination , it must be concluded that the Israeli Jewish > society does not consider Gazans full human beings . And just how was Gaza obtained ? Do you forget that Israel is not in the habit of grabbing land for the hell of it , but had taken Gaza in a war that it did not start ? Did you know land Israel captures in wars , wars which other nations have ALWAYS started , are n't the same as Israel , and they are subject to a completely different set of international laws ? Since you do continuously refer to international law , would you please say what specific international laws Israel is violating ? This attitude > is consistent with the attitude of the Nazis towards Jews . I can cite 6,000,000 reasons why it is not . > The > current policies by the Israeli government of cutting off Gaza are > consistent with the wish publicly expressed by Prime Mininister > Yitzhak Rabin that 'Gaza sink into the sea ' . Where is this quote ? I have never heard Rabin assert that he wished such a thing . Since you are in general a liar , you'll have to provide the entire quote , with source , or this effort will be regarded as just another one of your fabrications . > One is led to ask > oneself whether Israeli leaders entertain still more sinister > goals towards the Gazans ? Whether they have some Final Solution > up their sleeve ? Only you are led to ask such a loaded , racist , intellectually dishonest question . You inability to come to terms with what you are has turned you into a racist of the highest order . > I urge all those who have slight human compassion to do whatever > they can to help the Gazans regain their full human , civil and > political rights , to which they are entitled as human beings . Why do you not feel the same compassion for the Jews of Iran , or Iraq , or Yemen , or Saudi Arabia , or Syria ? Do you have an inkling of what they have endured over the past decades ? Or , what about the plight of the Palestinians in Kuwait ? Or what about the treatment of the Bosnian Muslims ? Do you think the residents of Gaza are being subjected to what all the Muslims in Bosnia are enduring ? Why are you indifferent to the death and suffering of people ? Why do you not care that these folk are being exterminated ? Why do you not care that only Israel has given any of these people safe haven ? Could it be due to the fact that it is not Israel who is doing the killing ? The people in Gaza are not being exterminated . They are n't being killed . They are n't being raped . They are n't being starved . They are n't being driven from their lands . They are not kept from receiving food or other supplies . But the Bosnians are . And the ONLY country which has provided some sanctuary to the Bosnian Muslims is the same nation that you have devoted your life to attacking , in the guise of compassion . Your rantings are so unfettered by the burden of intellectual honesty that you ought to take a deep breath and ask yourself what your real motives are . Do not flatter yourself into the belief that truth or compassion are what drives you . In your case , it is clear that hate beats out love every time . Maybe you are burdened with some kind of guilt for having been born a Jew . It is obvious that your hatred of your own Judaism is being dumped on all other Jews . Why else would you suggest a racist idea like breeding Jews out of existence ? Maybe these fits of anti-semitism are a result of being cut off from your own people for an extended period . Whatever the case may be , it is clear that you are not what you have labored so hard to appear to be . When you realize that you ca n't care for other people while you hate yourself you might actually begin to do some good . But for now , you are a fruad .

Actually , Hiten was n't originally intended to go into lunar orbit at all , so it indeed did n't have much fuel on hand . The lunar-orbit mission was an afterthought , after Hagoromo ( a tiny subsatellite deployed by Hiten during a lunar flyby ) had a transmitter failure and its proper insertion into lunar orbit could n't be positively confirmed . It should be noted that the technique does have disadvantages . It takes a long time , and you end up with a relatively inconvenient lunar orbit .

In the past , God gave us the ability to create life through sexual relations . Now , he is giving us the ability to create life through in vitro fertilization . The difference between the two is merely cosmetic , and even if we gain the ability to create universes we wo n't begin to approach the glory of God . The power we are being given is a test , and I am sure that in many cases we will use our new abilities unwisely .

In the first place the death of three soldiers on a patrol in occupied Lebanese terrritory is NOT an act of terrorism or murder . It is disingeneous to compare their death to that of athletes in Munich or any other act of terrorism or mrder . This exercise is aimed solely at diverting the issue and is far from the truth . It seems to me , Dorin , that , you are so remote and ignorant of the problem on the ground that your comments can only be charactrized as irrelevant , and heavily colored by the preconceptions and misinformation . I will try to paint the most accurate picture I can of what the situation really is in South Lebanon .

You claim that israelis shell the villages with the | > 'hope ' of finding a terrorist or so . If they kill one , fine , if not , too bad , | > civilians die , right ? I am not so sure . I am . I was back in my home village this last summer . For your information we are PEOPLE , not a bunch of indiscriminate terrorists . Most of the people in my village are regular inhabitants that go about their daily business , some work in the fields , some own small shops , others are older men that go to the coffe shop and drink coffee . Is that so hard to imagine ? ? ? ? It is NOT a `` terrorist camp '' as you and the Israelis like to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer in the streets , women preparing lunch , men playing cards , etc ... .. SOME young men , usually aged between 17 to 30 years are members of the Lebanese resistance . Even the inhabitants of the village do not know who these are , they are secretive about it , but most people often suspect who they are and what they are up to . These young men are supported financially by Iran most of the time . They sneak arms and ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps for Israeli patrols . Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injured by these traps , Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians . Once they are back they announce that they bombed a `` terrorist hideout '' where an 8 year old girl just happened to be . We are now accustomed to Israeli tactics , and we figure that this is the Israeli way of telling us that `` if you 're gon na hurt our soldiers you 're gon na pay the price '' . We accept this as a price we have to pay to free our land , Israel knows very well that it is not really hurting the resistance that much militarily with these strikes , but rather just keeping the pressure on the villagers to demand from their young men to stop attacking Israeli soldiers since these attacks are taking a heavy toll on the lives of the civilian villagers . Israel 's retalliation policy is cold hearted , but a reality that we have come to accept and deal with , the Lebanese Resistance on the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on OCCUPYING ISRAELI SOLDIERS until they withdraw , this is the only real leverage that they have to force Israel to withdraw . The people of South Lebanon are occupied , or shelled by Israel on a regular basis . We do not want to be occupied . If Israel insists that the so called `` Security Zone '' is necessary for the protection of Northern Israel , than it will have to pay the price of its occupation with the blood of its soldiers . If Israel is interested in peace , than it should withdraw from OUR land . We are not asking for the establishment of a Lebanese occupied zone in northern Israel to protect our villages that are attacked on a regular basis by Israel , so the best policy seems to be the removal of Israeli occupation and the establishment of peace keeping troops along the border . I have written before on this very newsgroup , that the only real solution will come as a result of a comprehensive peace settlement whereby Israel withdraws to its own borders and peace keeping troops are stationed along the border to insure no one on either side of the border is shelled . This is the only realistic solution , it is time for Israel to realize that the concept of a `` buffer zone '' aimed at protecting its northern cities has failed . In fact it has caused much more Israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israel would have resulted in . If Israel really wants to save some Israeli lives it would withdraw unilaterally from the so-called `` Security Zone '' before the conclusion of the peace talks . Such a move would save Israeli lives , advance peace efforts , give Israel a great moral lift , better Israel 's public image abroad and give it an edge in the peace negociations since Israel can rightly claim that it is genuinely interested in peace and has already offered some important concessions . Along with such a withdrawal Israel could demand that Hizbollah be disarmed by the Lebanese government and warn that it will not accept any attacks against its northern cities and that if such a shelling occurs than it will consider re-taking the buffer zone and will hold the Lebanese and Syrian government responsible for it . There seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese goovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such circumstances , and now the Lebanese government has proven that it is capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did in all other parts of Lebanon . | > If you ask me those questions , I will have no problem answering ( not with a | > question , as you did ) : No , NOBODY is qualified candidate for murder , nothing | > justifies murder .

From : jchen @ wind.bellcore.com ( Jason Chen ) Subject : LH Workmanship Nntp-Posting-Host : wind.bellcore.com Reply-To : jchen @ ctt.bellcore.com Organization : Bell Communications Research Lines : 19 I just visited the NY Auto Show , and saw two LH cars on the floor : Eagle Vision and Dodge Intrepid . Really nice I must say . Very attractive styling , lots of features and room , at a competitive price . Unfortunately , the workmanship is quite disappointing . On BOTH cars , the rubber seals around the window and door fell off . It turns out the seals are just big grooved rubber band . It goes on just by pressing the groove against the tongue on the door frame . Surely it would come off easily . I am not sure how many of this kind of pooring engineering/assembly problems that will show up later . I may still consider buying it , but only when it establishes a good track record . Jason Chen

Chinese , and many other Asians ( Japanese , Koreans , etc ) have used MSG as flavor enhancer for two thousand years . Do you believe that they knew how to make MSG from chemical processes ? Not .

It 's only been in the last year or two that airbags have become a significant selling feature . VW assumed that automatic belts would satisfy govt . requirements for passive restraint , but did n't guess that the 'merican consumer would actually make buy decisions based on the presence of an airbag . VW is really hurting right now in the US market . Check out the article in last week 's Autoweek about the crisis at VW . Golfs and Jettas will be coming from the plant in Mexico , but they do n't have the quality at that facility . As per normal VW practice , the US launch of the Jetta III is delayed again and again , until a good chunk of the useful life of the design is spent . I think that Passats come from Germany , so there is not the same quality and availability issue . It 's a nice car with a nice engine . Whether VW will be a player in the US market in two year 's time is a different question ... I 'll leave the Passat / Camry flamewar for someone else .

These laws written for the Israelites , God 's chosen people whom God had expressly set apart from the rest of the world . The Israelites were a direct witness to God 's existence . To disobey God after KNOWing that God is real would be an outright denial of God and therefore immediately punishable . Remember , these laws were written for a different time and applied only to God 's chosen people . But Jesus has changed all of that . We are living in the age of grace . Sin is no longer immediately punishable by death . There is repentance and there is salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ . And not just for a few chosen people .

Can anybody help me out ? The problem is that Motif uses XGrabKey to implement menu accelerators , and these grabs are specific about which modifiers apply .

This is true for accelerators and mnemonics , which are implemented using event handlers instead of grabs ; it 's not true for menu accelerators . If you 're a Motif implementor , I 'd suggest lobbying to get the Xlib semantics changed to support the feature I described above . Otherwise , change the documentation for menu accelerators to properly set the user's expectations , because menu accelerators are NOT the same thing as translations . > Is it possible to supply > 1 accelerator for a menu entry ?

There is a workaround for Motif users . In addition to the normal menu accelerator you install on the XmPushButton [ Gadget ] , set an XtNaccelerators resource on the shell ( TopLevel or Application ) . Install the shell's accelerators on itself and all of its descendants with XtInstallAllAccelerators ( shell , shell ) . For example , applicationShell - mainWindow - menuBar - fileCascade -- filePulldown - openPushbutton - exitPushbutton *openPushbutton.accelerator = Ctrl < Key > O *openPushbutton.acceleratorText = Ctrl+O *exitPushbutton.accelerator = Ctrl < Key > Q *exitPushbutton.acceleratorText = Ctrl+Q *applicationShell.accelerators = # override\n\ Ctrl < Key > O : PerformAction ( *openPushbutton , ArmAndActivate ) \n\ Ctrl < Key > Q : PerformAction ( *exitPushbutton , ArmAndActivate ) You have to write and add the application action PerformAction , which you can implement by using XtNameToWidget on the first argument and then XtCallActionProc with the rest of the arguments . I tested out something similar to this . To shorten development time , I used TeleUSE 's TuNinstallAccelerators resource to install the accelerators on the shell , and I directly invoked the Open and Quit D actions instead of asking the pushbuttons to do it for me , but the more general approach I described above should work . -- Trevor Bourget ( trevor @ telesoft.com )

Organization : none Lines : 52 Bob Van Cleef writes : If the Papacy is infallible , and this is a matter of faith , then the Pope can not `` be wrong ! '' If , on the other hand , this is not a matter of faith , but a matter of Church law , then we should still obey as the Pope is the legal head of the church . In other words , given the doctrine of infallibility , we have no choice but to obey . This is a primary problem in the Church today . What you are saying is more or less heresy . You might call it `` infallibilism '' . It 's the idea that the Pope is always right in everything he says or does . This is virtually all over the place , especially in this country . The Pope is only infallible under certain very specific and well-defined conditions . When these conditions are not met , he can make mistakes . He can make *big* mistakes . A couple historical examples come to mind . Bishop Robert Grosseteste was perhaps the greatest product of the English Catholic Church . At one point during his career , the reigning Pope decided to install one of his nephews in an English see . Bishop Grosseteste said that this would happen over his dead body ( though maybe not in so many words ; you have to treat Popes with respect , even when they are wrong ) . The problem was that this nephew would just collect the income of the see , and probably never set foot there . This would deprive the people of the see of a shepherd . Bishop Grosseteste was quite right in what he did ! Another example is that of Pope John XXII , a Pope of the Middle Ages . He decided that souls that were saved did not enjoy the Beatific Vision until the Last Judgement . He decided that this should be a defined doctrine of the Church . Though he did n't quite get around to defining it . Now there 's no way this is compatible with Catholic doctrine . The Pope 's doctrine was criticised by many in the Church . He went so far as to put a number of his opponents in jail , even . In the end , he had to admit his mistake . Shortly before he died , he recanted . His successor made the exact *opposite* idea a dogma of the Church . If you consult any of the great Catholic theologians who treat of such subjects , such as St. Robert Bellarmine ( a Doctor of the Church ) , you will find detailed discussions of whether the Pope can personally fall into heresy or schism . The teaching of all such theologians is that the commands of a Pope must be resisted if they are to the detriment of the Catholic Faith . A Pope 's authority is given for the purpose of building up the Catholic Church . Commands in conflict with this purpose have no legal *or* moral force .

From : baalke @ kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov ( Ron Baalke ) Subject : JPL 's VLBI Project Meets with International Space Agencies Organization : Jet Propulsion Laboratory Lines : 112 Distribution : world NNTP-Posting-Host : kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov Keywords : VLBI , JPL News-Software : VAX/VMS VNEWS 1.41 From the `` JPL Universe '' April 23 , 1993 VLBI project meets with international space agencies By Ed McNevin Members of JPL 's Space Very Long Baseline Interferometry ( VLBI ) project team recently concluded a week-long series of meetings with officials from Russia and Japan . The meetings were part of `` Space VLBI Week '' held at JPL in early March and were intended to maintain cooperation between international space agencies participating in the development of the U.S. Space VLBI Project , a recently approved JPL flight project set for launch in 1995 . U.S. Space VLBI will utilize two Earth-orbiting spacecraft -- the Japanese VSOP ( VLBI Space Observing Program ) satellite with its 8-meter radio telescope , and a Russian RADIOASTRON 10-meter satellite . Both spacecraft will team up with ground-based radio telescopes located around the world to create a radio telescope network that astronomers hope will expand radio telescope observing power by a factor of 10 . Japan 's VSOP satellite will use a limited six-hour orbit to conduct imaging science , while the Russian RADIOASTRON spacecraft will exploit a larger , 28-hour Earth orbit to conduct exploratory radio astronomy . Each satellite will point at a source target for roughly 24 hours , while approximately 20 ground-based radio telescopes will simultaneously point at the same source object while within view on Earth . According to Dr. Joel Smith , JPL 's project manager for the U.S. Space VLBI , meetings like those held at JPL will permit Japan and Russia , who have little previous experience in radio interferometry , to establish working relationships with the radio astronomy communities that will be vital during the complex observations required by the Space VLBI project . `` One of our main activities is developing the methodology for international coordination , because the two spacecraft simultaneously rely on the corresponding tracking stations while using the ground-based radio telescopes to observe the same celestial objects , '' said Smith . Three new tracking antennas are being built at DSN facilities and other three other tracking facilities located in Japan , Russia and Green Bank , W.Va . This global network of ground-based radio telescopes will use precision clocks and high-speed recorders to collect observation data and forward the information to a correlator located at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Socorro , N.M . The correlator will combine and process data , then make it available to mission investigators in Moscow , Tokyo , and JPL via electronic mail . Smith is optimistic that the massive radio telescope created by the Space VLBI network will provide radio astronomers with better resolution than has ever been achieved before by ground-based radio telescopes , allowing astronomers to take a closer look at distant objects in space . `` There is a long history of radio astronomy using ground-based telescopes , '' said Smith . `` What we intend to do is to extend radio astronomy into Earth orbit . Our goal is to look deeper into the cores of galactic nuclei , quasars and other active radio sources to understand what drives those things we have seen so far with radio astronomy . '' Smith noted that if one examines `` the active galactic nuclei , you 'll find jets appearing to spew at speeds greater than light , and at energy levels that are millions of times greater than you would expect . '' He said some astronomers believe that black holes may be located in the cores of these galaxies , and that they may fuel the jets . Smith hopes that `` by using Space VLBI to look further into the cores , this theory may be supported or disproved . '' Russian space-flight hardware , including transponders and transmitters , are now being tested in the United States , and Japanese hardware is scheduled to arrive for testing later this year . Analysis of this hardware will permit U.S. scientists and engineers to understand how to modify the high-speed VLBA Correlator operating at the NRAO in order to accommodate the odd data patterns that will originate from the more than 20 ground-based radio telescopes involved in Space VLBI . Smith is particularly pleased that meetings with the Japanese and Russian space agency officials -- like those held at JPL in March -- have proceeded smoothly . Yet he knows that the political uncertainty in Russia could jeopardize that country's participation in the project . `` Nothing is ever smooth , '' he said , `` but the Russians have been incredibly open with us . We always anticipated some likelihood that we will not succeed because of political factors beyond our control , yet there tends to be a way of keeping these things going , because scientists on both sides are trying hard , and people recognize the value of cooperation at this level . '' Smith points out that the Japanese space agency has more at stake than just fulfilling an international commitment to a science mission . `` The Japanese have been extremely cooperative , since international cooperation is essential to their science mission , '' he said . But Smith also noted that Japanese space agency officials look at the U.S. Space VLBI mission as an opportunity to showcase the technology involved with VSOP spacecraft , and their highly regarded Mach V launch vehicle . Yet regardless of the risks involved in undertaking such an ambitious project , JPL 's Smith is satisfied that planning for the Space VLBI Project is beyond the significant financial and political hurdles that otherwise might threaten the project . `` Fortunately , we have the virtue of having two partners , and if either falls out , we would still have something with the other . By themselves , both spacecraft are independent , scientifically exciting missions .

From : f2ehg786 @ umiami.ir.miami.edu Subject : Disappointed by La Cie Organization : Univ of Miami IR Lines : 52 Approximately four months ago , I purchased a Quantum 240LPS HD from La Cie for $ 649 . After two months , the drive started having problems . First , there were intermittent freezes , then corrupted files and resources , then Silverlining 5.41 would n't even recognize the drive . So I got an RMA from La Cie and exchanged the new drive for a reconditioned one . Well , about a month has passed now and the second drive is having problems . Often , when I boot up my IIsi I get the flashing question mark . Sometimes , if I then insert the Silverlining ( 5.42 ) program I can get it to recognize the drive by making it scan over and over for drives . At that point I can restart the IIsi and boot from the HD . I 've called La Cie again and they 've given me another RMA . Their tech support people tell me that if Silverlining does n't see the drive there 's a definite hardware problem . Given that this is the second bad drive in four months , I asked La Cie to send me a *new* one , but they said `` no . '' Also , within three weeks after I purchased my original drive , La Cie dropped the price on it by over $ 100 . I can accept that a drive ( or two ) may be bad . And I know that hardware vendors make a practice of sending reconditioned replacements when they do repairs . And I understand that the nature of the computer industry lends itself to sudden price fluctuations . Nevertheless , taken together , the convergence of these facts/events have left a bad taste in my mouth . ( I should have added above that when I asked La Cie to transfer the contents of my current drive to the one they will send_I think the data is still in good shape and I 'll have to again reinstall everything from floppies_they said it would cost me $ 250 for data recovery . ) It seems to me that reconditioned hardware should be sold as reconditioned at a discounted price , and that replacements for new hardware gone bad ( still covered under a 90-day warranty ) should be new . I feel a little helpless about all this . I do n't mean to necessarily flame La Cie_their support staff have always been friendly and sometimes even helpful . But c'mon . Sometimes a little extra customer service goes a long way . ( I sent a letter to La Cie 's customer service when the first drive was returned and I asked them for a credit on the price difference since I had purchased the drive three weeks before they slashed the price . I told them I would like to apply the credit toward the purchase of another La Cie product . They did n't even have the courtesy to reply one way or the other . ) What 's the moral of this story ? I 'm not sure . But I do know I wo n't buy any other products from La Cie in the future . Bill Krauthammer f2ehg786 @ umiami.ir.miami.edu PS Please do n't email or post about how good your La Cie product and service has been . I 'm not suggesting that they are not a good company or anything like that . All I 'm saying is that I 've had a disappointing experience with them and I 'll be taking my business elsewhere in the future .

If no-one looks at the results , or acknowledges their correctness , in what meaningful sense can the chip be said to `` work '' ? ? Does flibozity exist ? By `` flibozity '' , I mean a particular , extremely complex configuration of physical phenomena , which no-one , absolutely NO-ONE cares about in the slightest . Does it exist , Eric ? Getting back to the question of whether the DES chip `` works '' , does n't `` work '' mean something like `` achieving the desired/expected effect '' ? Note the way intentionality subtly underlies that definition . Even if we take the definition as `` expected '' , instead of `` desired '' , can you deny that conformance to expectations is itself a value of sorts , namely the scientific values of accuracy-of-prediction and reproducibility-of-results ? The phenomenologist Husserl , for one , considered Intentionality to be the primary ontological `` stuff '' from which all other ontology was built -- perceptions , consciousness , thoughts , etc . Frank is by no means alone in seeing intentionality ( or `` values '' , as he puts it ) underlying all human experience , even the so-called `` objective '' experiences , such as measurements of the natural world , or the output of your DES chip . - Kevin

While I do n't read normally read this group , I was looking for Valentine radar information ( sigh , maybe in the FAQ ) and came across your posting.. I bought a '93 Probe GT with the PEP 263A last July ( now at 9500 miles ) after debating over the Sentra SE-R/NX2000 , MX6 , MR-2 , Stealth , Prelude , and Celica . Check this month 's Consumer Reports for previous Probe records . My criteria : a `` fun '' car with ABS , airbag , over 130hp , and less than $ 25K . I thought about a turbo , but checking with insurance people ruled that out . The Tri-Star cars ( Eclipse/Talon/etc ) were out since they do n't have an air bag . Ditto for the Mustang ( also no ABS ) . The SE-R/NX2000/M20 fell into the pocket-rocket category . A good used car buy . The MX-6 was almost there but rolled more than I liked . I did n't like the Prelude dash/instrumentation at all . Too weird for me . The MR2 has a much smaller non-passenger space than I needed , so out that went . The Celica was `` ok '' but underpowered when loaded with options ( and somewhat overpriced too ) in non-turbo form . I never considered the 240SX since it did n't have an airbag . I did look at it for its RWD virtues but that 's it . The Corolla never entered my mind . I should have looked at the Mitsubishi VR4/Dodge Stealth more . Since my list was exhausted , I bought the Probe . : - ) The car design is different than earlier years , so it 's too early to see its reliability so far . For what it 's worth , my comments : My dislikes : Shutting door with windows up from inside rarely makes good wind seal . Headlights have `` stuck '' up a few times ( weather ? ) air conditioning broke ~4000 miles ( pressure cycling switch ) condensation around rear washer fluid container does n't drain completely . crammed engine ; little hope for do-it-yourselfers ( typical ) parts somewhat more expensive than normal Ford parts underside plastic does n't like sharp driveways and speedbumps ( typical ) . assembly gripes : tape on radiator , screw fell out of dash , seat seams not stitched properly . Hopefully just a fluke . Ford only gives 1 key with the car . C'mon Ford , spend an extra few pennies ! Rear hatch has no padding on corners when up . I 'm waiting for the day when I bash my head on the corner . horn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center ( personal preference ) Tires fling dirt/mud onto side of car My Likes : engine ( design/valves/sounds/smoothness/power/mileage/torque ) -- definitely # 1 handling ( very good for FWD ; understeer only at limits ) transmission ( the 5 speed is a must ) usable instrumentation ( lovely readable analog everywhere ) Very little torque steer at full power ( much better than the '90 SHO I drive ) stability at 100+mph ( high gearing though ) low cowl ( good visibility in front ) Heated outside mirrors ( nice in fog , never tested in freezing weather ) ABS/Air bag ( see above ) rear seats fold down ( I have few rear seat passengers so a trunk not important ) No shake/rattle noises when going over bumps/potholes ( still ! ) Tires : 225/55VR16 Goodyear Eagles ( 70 % left ; hoping for 30K : - ) As you can see , I 'm primarily interested in the engine . While it doesn't have the uummmph of a big-liter car or the turbo rush , the big selling point for me was the all-aluminum 24 value 2.5 liter engine . The overall car is a good buy for the money . That market segment has n't changed much since July ( Prelude VTEC , Honda Del Sol ? ? ) . I drive it to and from work each day on relatively smooth roads , and most noticable thing is that the Probe 's suspension does n't like potholes . When you test drive one , find a potholed road somewhere around town and see if the jarring you get is tolerable . If you have 3+ passengers , by all means bring them along too . They 'll find that they have no room in the back and you 'll find that the car rides differently ( if that 's `` better '' is up to you ) . Also , there 's a lot of glass around you which I was n't expecting ; the temperature inside the car gets pretty hot in the summer . My back seat passengers ( now very few ) complain about the lack of ventilation ; you may want to consider that when combined with the heat . I 've heard that the exhaust system has trouble , but mine works fine . Leather and the keyless entry system were n't available when I got the car so I ca n't comment on them ( I got the car before it was officially announced ) . I prefer cloth to leather anyway . I would n't want this car in the snow : The suspension is too rough for the inevitable surprise potholes , tires are n't meant for snow , and the seats assume that you 're not wearing lots of thick clothing . Rain is much better : water generally beads off the windshield at freeway speed , the windshield wiper controls are easy and understandable , and I barely hydroplaned once with the Eagles ( and I was really trying ) . There is also a definite lack of cup holder/small storage places . The GT has map holders below the speakers in the door , but they 're rigid plastic that could fit two cassettes or CD 's max . The center console/storage bin/arm rest has *1* cup holder and the back of the front seats have a cloth `` pouch '' but that 's it . No change holders . Quite a let-down from the SHO . And the Probe is definitely not a people-mover car or an econo-box car ! Lastly , do n't store wet car covers in the back . The foam will soak the water up and the result will *not* smell pleasant : - ( .

Do you mean by `` omnipotent '' that God should be able to do anything/everything ? This creates a self-contradictory definition of omnipotence which is effectively useless . To be descriptive , omnipotence must mean `` being all-powerful '' and not `` being able to do anything/everything '' . Let me illustrate by analogy . Suppose the United States were the only nuclear power on earth . Suppose further that the US military could not effectively be countered by any nation or group of nations . The US has the power to go into any country at any time for any reason to straighten things out as the leaders of the US see fit . The US would be militarily `` omnipotent '' . But suppose further that the US holds to a doctrine/philosophy of not interfering in the internal affairs of any nation , such as the current civil war in the former Yugoslavian states . Technically ( in this scenario ) the US would have the power to unilaterally go into Yugoslavia and straighten out the mess . But effectively the US could not intervene without violating its own policy of non-interference . If the policy of non-interference were held to strongly enough , then there would never be a question that it would ever be violated . Effectively , the US would be limited in what it could actually do , although it had the power to do `` whatever it wanted '' . The US would simply `` never want to interfere '' for such an idea would be beyond the consideration of its leaders given such an inviolate non-interference policy . God is effectively limited in the same sense . He is all powerful , but He can not use His power in a way that would violate the essence of what He , Himself is . I hope this helps to clear up some of the misunderstanding concerning omnipotence . Regards , Jim B .

The ground is supposed to be a protective ground , and though what you suggest looks good on paper , it 's dangerous to rely on the same wire for power and protection . It 'd never meet code , and if you now own the property and later sell it , you may end up with liabilities you do n't want , and if you _don't_ now own it , well ... There 's a `` wiring '' FAQ that I think addresses this . I believe an alternative is use of a GFCI , but I 'm really not sure what current code allows in this area . The GFCI senses alternate ( unwanted ) current paths , and does n't rely on a specific protective ground wire , at least not beyond the GFCI in the protected circuit .

From : jchen @ wind.bellcore.com ( Jason Chen ) Subject : MILITECH Nntp-Posting-Host : wind.bellcore.com Reply-To : jchen @ ctt.bellcore.com Organization : Bell Communications Research Lines : 34 I saw an interesting product in NY Auto Show , and would like to hear your comments . MILITECH ( tm ) is yet another oil additive . But the demonstration of this product really impressive , if it did n't cheat . The setup of the demo is fairly simple . A cone shaped rotor is half submerged in a small oil sink , filled with motor oil . The rotor is powered by an electronic motor . A metal pad is pressed against the rotor using the torque wrench until the rotor stopped by friction . The torque that is needed to stop rotor is read from the torque wrench . Before MILITECH was added , the rotor was stopped with about 60 lb-ft of torque ( You pick the brand of oil , no difference ) . Once MILITECH was added to the oil , the rotor could not be stopped even with 120+ lb-ft of torque . Here is the good part : even after the salesman emptied the oil sink , you still could not stopped the rotor with the thin film remained on it . They say you need only add 2oz per quart of oil every 15k miles . A 16 oz bottle is $ 25 . I still have my doubts . If this product is really so great , why it was so little known ? The salesman said it is widely used in military . I didn't believe it . The demo was so impressive , that I bought a bottle against my common sense . Has anyone heard of or actually used this product ? Is it real ? If you are going to the auto show , please visit this stand on the second floor . See if can find out if the demo is a hoax or not .

From : jhpb @ sarto.budd-lake.nj.us ( Joseph H. Buehler ) Subject : Re : SSPX schism ? Organization : none Lines : 240 Larry L. Overacker writes , responding to Simon : I may be interesting to see some brief selections posted to the net . My understanding is that SSPX does not consider ITSELF in schism or legitimately excommunicated . But that 's really beside the point . What does the Roman Catholic church say ? Excommunication can be real apart from formal excommunication , as provided for in canon law . Here 's some of the theology involved for the interested . There is confusion over this issue of the SSPX 's `` schism '' ; often the basic problem is lack of an ability to distinguish between : - true obedience - false obedience - disobedience - schism Take the various classifications of obedience first . There are 2 important elements involved here for my purposes : 1 ) a command 2 ) the response made to the command As far as the command goes , commands can be LEGITIMATE , such as the Pope ordering Catholics to not eat meat on Fridays . Or they can be ILLEGITIMATE , such as the Pope ordering Catholics to worship the god Dagon when every other full moon comes around . As far as the response to a command goes , it can be to REFUSE to do what is commanded , or to COMPLY . Making a table , there are thus 4 possibilites : command response name -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - LEGITIMATE COMPLY true obedience ILLEGITIMATE REFUSE true obedience LEGITIMATE REFUSE disobedience ILLEGITIMATE COMPLY false obedience So now you see where my 3 classifications of obedience come from . Obedience is not solely a matter of compliance/refusal . The nature of the commands must also be taken into account ; it is not enough to consider someone 's compliance or refusal and then say whether they are '' obedient '' or `` disobedient '' . You also have to take into consideration whether the commands are good or bad . In my example , if the Pope commands all Catholics to worship the god Dagon , and they all refuse , they are n't being disobedient at all ! As far as the Society of Saint Pius X goes , they are certainly refusing to comply with certain things the Pope desires . But that alone is insufficient to allow one to label them `` disobedient '' . You also have to consider the nature of the Papal desires . And there 's the rub : SSPX says the Popes since Vatican II have been commanding certain very bad things for the Church . The Popes have of course disagreed . So where are we ? Are we in another Arian heresy , complete with weak Popes ? Or are the SSPX priests modern Martin Luthers ? Well , the only way to answer that is to examine who is saying what , and what the traditional teaching of the Church is . The problem here is that very few Catholics have much of an idea of what is really going on , and what the issues are . The religion of American Catholics is especially defective in intellectual depth . You will never read about the issues being discussed in the Catholic press in this country . ( On the other hand , one Italian Catholic magazine I get -- 30 Days -- has had interviews with the Superior General of the Society of Saint Pius X . ) Many Catholics will decide to side with the Pope . There is some soundness in this , because the Papacy is infallible , so eventually some Pope *will* straighten all this out . But , on the other hand , there is also unsoundness in this , in that , in the short term , the Popes may indeed be wrong , and such Catholics are doing nothing to help the situation by obeying them where they 're wrong . In fact , if the situation is grave enough , they sin in obeying him . At the very least , they 're wasting a great opportunity , because they are failing to love Christ in a heroic way at the very time that He needs this badly . Schism ... let 's move on to schism . What is it ? Schism is a superset of disobedience ( refusal to obey a legitimate command ) . All schismatics are disobedient . But it 's a superset , so it does n't work the other way around : not all disobeyers are schismatics . The mere fact that the SSPX priests do n't comply with the Holy Father 's desires does n't make them schismatics . So what is it that must be added to disobedience to constitute a schism ? Maybe this something else makes the SSPX priests schismatics . You must add this : the rejection of the right to command . Look in any decent reference on Catholic theology , and that 's what you 'll find : the distinguishing criterion of schism is rejection of the right to command . Here 's what the Catholic Encyclopedia says , for example : ... not every disobedience is a schism ; in order to possess this character it must include besides the trangression of the commands of superiors , denial of their Divine right to command . ( from the CE article `` Schism '' ) Is the Society of Saint Pius X then schismatic ? The answer is a clear no : they say that the Pope is their boss . They pray for him every day . And that 's all that matters as far as schism goes . What all this boils down to is this : if we leave aside the consideration of the exact nature of their objections , their position is a legitimate one , as far as the Catholic theology of obedience and schism goes . They are resisting certain Papal policies because they think that they are clearly contrary to the traditional teaching of the Papacy , and the best interests of the Church . ( In fact , someone who finds himself in this situation has a *duty* to resist . ) Now , what is the stance of Rome on all this ? Well , if you read the Holy Father 's motu proprio `` Ecclesia Dei '' , you can find out . It 's the definitive document on the subject . A motu proprio is a specifically Papal act . It 's not the product of a Roman congregation , a letter that the Pope has possibly never even read . It 's from the Pope himself . His boss is God ... there 's no one else to complain to . In this document , the Holy Father says , among other things : 1 ) The episcopal consecrations performed by Archbishop Lefebvre constituted a schismatic act . 2 ) Archbishop Lefebvre 's problem was a misunderstanding of the nature of Tradtion . Both are confusing : I fail to see the logic of the Pope 's points . As far as the episcopal consecrations go , I read an interesting article in a translation of the Italian magazine `` Si Si No No '' . It all gets back to the question of jurisdiction . If episcopal consecrations imply rejection of the Pope 's jurisdiction , then they would truly constitute a schismatic act , justifying excommunication under the current code of canon law . But my problem with this is this : according to the traditional theology of Holy Orders , episcopal consecration does not confer jurisdiction . It only confers the power of Order : the ability to confect the Sacraments . Jurisdiction must be conferred by someone else with the power to confer it ( such as the Pope ) . The Society bishops , knowing the traditional theology quite well , take great pains to avoid any pretence of jurisdiction over anyone . They simply confer those Sacraments that require a bishop . The `` Si Si No No '' article was interesting in that it posited that the reason that the Pope said what he did is that he has a novel , post-Vatican II idea of Holy Orders . According to this idea , episcopal consecration *does* confer jurisdiction . I lent the article to a friend , unfortunately , so ca n't tell you more . I believe they quoted the new code of canon law in support of this idea . The Pope 's thinking on this point remains a great puzzle to me . There 's no way there is a schism , according to traditional Catholic theology . So why does the Pope think this ? As far as the points regarding the nature of Tradition goes , here's the passage in question : The root of this schismatic act can be discerned in an incomplete and contradictory notion of Tradtion . Incomplete , because it does not take sufficiently into the account the living character of Tradition , which , as the Second Vatican Council clearly taught , comes from the apostles and progresses in the Church with the help of the Holy Spirit . There is a growth in insight into the realities and words that are being passed on . This comes about in various ways . It comes through the contemplation and study of believers who ponder these things in their hearts . It comes from the intimate sense of spiritual realities which they experience . And it comes from the preaching of those who have received , along with their right of succession in the espiscopate , the sure charism of truth . But especially contradictory is a notion of Tradition which opposes the universal Magisterium of the Church possessed by the Bishop of Rome and the body of bishops . It is impossible to remain faithful to the Tradition while breaking the ecclesial bond with him to whom , in the person of the Apostle Peter , Christ himself entrusted the ministry of unity in His Church . ( Papal motu proprio `` Ecclesia Dei '' , 2 July 1988 ) It seems to me that the Holy Father is making two points here that can be simplified to the following : - Vatican Council II has happened . - I am the Pope . The argument being that either case is sufficient to prove that Archbishop Lefebvre must be wrong , because he disagrees with them . This is weak , to say the least ! It would have helped clarify things more if the Pope had addressed Archbishop Lefebvre 's concerns in detail . What is John Paul II's stand on the social Kingship of Christ , as taught by Gregory XVI , Pius IX , Leo XIII , Pius XI and Pius XII , for example ? Are we supposed to ignore what all these Popes said on the subject ? I do n't know what the future will hold , but the powers that be in the SSPX are still talking with Rome and trying to straighten things out . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- [ Many people would prefer to call a justified refusal to obey '' justified disobedience '' or even `` obeying God rather than man '' . Calling a refusal to obey obedience puts us into a sort of Alice in Wonderland world where words mean whatever we want them to mean . Similarly , schism indicates a formal break in the church . If the Pope says that a schism exists , it seems to me that by definition it exists . It may be that the Pope is on the wrong side of the break , that there is no good reason for the break to exist , and that it will shortly be healed . But how can one deny that it does in fact exist ? It seems to me that you are in grave danger of destroying the thing you are trying to reform : the power of the papacy . What good will it do you if you become reconciled to the the Pope in the future , but in the process , you have destroyed his ability to use the tools of church discipline ? It 's one thing to hold that the Pope has misused his powers , and excommunicated someone wrongly . It 's something else to say that his excommunication did not take effect , and the schism is all in his imagination . That means that acts of church discipline are not legal tools , but acts whose validity is open to debate . Generally it has been liberal Catholics who have had problems with the Pope . While they have often objected to church sanctions , generally they have admitted that the sanctions exist . You are now opening the door to people simply ignoring papal decisions , claiming to be truly obeying by disobeying , and to be in communion while excommunicated . This would seem to be precisely the denial of Divine right to command that you say defines schism . -- clh ]

That is n't enough to change your Windows startup logo . vgalogo.rle is not needed after you have installed Windows . It is incorporated as a part of win.com . To make a new win.com , you have to concatinate three files together , using the /b option for a binary concatonation . I beleive it is copy /b win.cnf+vgalogo.lgo+vgalogo.rle mywin.com Make sure you backup your win.com file in anotehr directory before you do this -- I absent-mindedly typed win.com instead of mywin.com and had to resinstall Windows ! Anyway , substitute whatever .RLE file you want . The win.cnf has the info needed to start Windows ( think of it as a bootstrap ) and vgalogo.vga has video information . Just make sure that the .RLE file does n't tip the whole COM file size over the 64k limit of a .COM file ! So anyway , I use mywin.com to startup MS Windows .

My brother was living with someone like that and things were almost as bad ( although he left after a considerably shorter amount of time due to other problems with the relationship ) . Anyway , the best thing to do would be to get everyone in the same room together ( optimally in a room with nothing breakable ) , lock the door behind you , throw the key out underneath the door ( just as far as the longest hand can reach . You would like to get out after the conclusion , I would imagine ) , and hash things out . More than likely , there will be screaming , crying , and possibly hitting ( unless of course someone decided to bring some rope to tie people down ) . Some of the best strategies in keeping things calmer would include : have each individual own their own statements ( ie , I feel that this relationship is hurting everyone involved because ... . or I really don't understand where you 're coming from . ) reinforce statements by paraphrasing , etc . ( ie , So you think that we did this because of ... ? Well , let me just say that the reason for this was ... . ) do n't accuse each other ( It was your fault that ... happened ! ) find a common ground about SOMETHING ( Lampshades really are decorational and functional at the same time . ) Guaranteed , in a situation like this , there is going to be some gunnysacking ( re-hashing topics which were assumed resolved , but were truly not and someone feels someone else is to blame ) . However , this should be kept to a minimum and simply ask for forgiveness or apologize about each situation WITHOUT holding a smoldering grudge . The relationship really can work . It 's just a matter of keeping things smooth and even . It 's sort of like making a peace treaty between warring factions : you ca n't give one side everything ; there must be a compromise . Breaks can be taken , but communication between everyone involved must continue if the relationships here are to survive . Joe Fisher

You 're obviously not referring to any of the three above-quoted individuals , because barnacles do n't each send $ 20 to the crew of the ship to keep it moving . `` Get the organization to act on it '' is easy to say , but says little about what one really can and should do . What the organization actually will do is largely determined by the president and directors , as far as I can see . That 's what makes it so important to vote in an election of officers . It does strike me that the BMWMOA is a lot less politically active ( in the state and national arenas , not infighting ) than other M/C organizations . Should we change this ? Or just join the other groups that already are in politics ? ( Incidentally , the political hazards to motorcycle riders in the US at the moment do n't compare to the problems of some other groups like gun owners .

I originally wrote the routines as a kind of exercise for myself , but perhaps someone here will find them useful . They are certainly useable as they are , but are missing some higher-level functionality . They 're intended more as an intro to mode 13h programming , a starting point . *** The library assumes a 386 processor , but it is trivial to modify it *** for a 286 . If enough people ask , I 'll make the mods and re-post it as a *** different version . The routines are written in assembly ( TASM ) and are callable from C. They are fairly simple , but I 've found them to be very fast ( for my purposes , anyway ) . Routines are included to enter and exit mode 13h , define a '' virtual screen '' , put and get pixels , put a pixmap ( rectangular image with no transparent spots ) , put a sprite ( image with see-thru areas ) , copy areas of the virtual screen into video memory , etc . I 've also included a simple C routine to draw a line , as well as a C routine to load a 256 color GIF image into a buffer . I also wrote a quick ' n'dirty ( tm ) demo program that bounces a bunch of sprites around behind three `` windows '' . The whole package is available on spang.camosun.bc.ca in /pub/dos/vgl.zip It is zipped with pkzip 2.04g It is completely in the public domain , as far as I 'm concerned . Do with it whatever you like . However , it 'd be nice to get credit where it 's due , and maybe an e-mail telling me you like it ( if you do n't like it do n't bother ) Mark morley @ camosun.bc.ca

Suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped Window that contains Xlib graphics . A button widget , when pressed , will cause a new item to be drawn in the Window . This action clearly should not call XCopyArea ( ) ( or equiv ) directly ; instead , it should register the existence of the new item in a memory structure and let the expose event handler take care of rendering the image because at that time it is guaranteed that the Window is mapped . The problem , of course , is that no expose event is generated if the window is visible and mapped . Do you know the best way to `` tickle '' a window so that the expose event handler will be invoked to draw this new item ?

These objects range from human figures to airplanes , from semi-trucks to lampposts . These objects are all freely distributable , and most have READMEs that describe them . In order to convert these objects to a human-readable format , a file with the specification of TDDD is included in the directory with the objects . There is also a shareware system called TTDDDLIB ( officially on hubcap.clemson.edu ) that will convert ( ala PBM+ ) to/from various object formats : Imagine TTDDD ( extension of TDDD ? ) , OFF , NFF , Rayshade 4.0 , or vort .

IGES [ v. 5.1 now ] tries to define a standard to tranfer solid models - Brep and CSG . The current standard number is ANSI Y14.26M-1987 For documentation , you might want to contact Nancy Flower at NCGA Technical Services and Standards , 1-800-225-6242 ext . 325 and the cost is $ 100 . This standard is not available in electronic format . c. PDES/STEP : This slowly emerging standard tries to encompass not only the geometrical information , but also for things like FEM , etc . The main bodies besides this standard are NIST and DARPA . You can get more information about PDES by sending mail to nptserver @ cme.nist.gov and putting the line send index in the body ( NOT the Subject : ) area of the message .

There are some things you might be interested to know about today 's RISC processors . It is true that there are fewer instructions , but what is not commonly known is that this causes the size of your executables to swell , so that in some cases performance is similar for larger applications . As a compromise , many RISC processors today are actually a cross between a Reduced Instructions Set , and a Complex one . This is not to say that there is no future in CISC processors , Intel has certainly proved that .

FMGs who are not citizens are , like all aliens , in a difficult situation . Only citizens get to vote here , so non-citizens are of little or no interest to legislators .

Okay , we do n't use the card quite like one should , because we simulate errors in the 68000 . Before every instruction some specified registers are masked , eg . to simulate a stuck-at-1-error in certain bits . Normally , the `` crash instance '' of A/ROSE notices a crash , sets a flag and stops working . By reading the mentioned flag the Mac can notice a card crash . That works fine for almost all crashes , but as said , sometimes the card does n't set the flag and disappears from the system .

Gaucher 's disease symptoms include : brittle bones ( he lost 9 inches off his hieght ) ; enlarged liver and spleen ; internal bleeding ; and fatigue ( all the time ) . The problem ( in Type 1 ) is attributed to a genetic mutation where there is a lack of the enzyme glucocerebroside in macrophages so the cells swell up . This will eventually cause death . Enyzme replacement therapy has been successfully developed and approved by the FDA in the last few years so that those patients administered with this drug ( called Ceredase ) report a remarkable improvement in their condition . Ceredase , which is manufactured by biotech biggy company -- Genzyme -- costs the patient $ 380,000 per year . Gaucher 's disease has justifyably been called `` the most expensive disease in the world '' . NEED INFO : I have researched Gaucher 's disease at the library but am relying on netlanders to provide me with any additional information : **news , stories , reports **people you know with this disease **ideas , articles about Genzyme Corp , how to get a hold of enough money to buy some , programs available to help with costs . **Basically ANY HELP YOU CAN OFFER Thanks so very much !

How does one tell if a Second Coming is the real thing , unless the > person claiming to be IT is obviously insane ? One rule of thumb is that if a person is making the claim , they are wrong . I was just reading John 14 this morning ( I think that is the right chapter , anyway it is close and I do n't have a Bible at work to check with . ) and in it Jesus is talking to his disciples about his impending death and he says that he will be going away and then later he will be with them . He said something along the lines of `` I will be in you and you will be in me . '' ( Again I can not provide the exact quote or citation . ) Anyway , my understanding of this is that the Second Coming will not be an outward event . It is an inward event , Christ will come to live in our hearts and we will live in him . If you look for a person you will be deceived . It seems to me that the Jews had been looking for a Messiah that would be a political or military leader and so did n't recognize Jesus when he came . Jesus tried to show that his Kingdom was not of this earth . A lot of what I have seen written about the Second Coming seems to based on an expectation of Christ coming back and finally taking over the world and running it the way it should be . It sounds a lot like what the Jews were looking for . The First Coming was n't like that and I see no reason for the Second Coming to be like that either . Oh and by the way , I do n't expect it to happen once . There is no one Second Coming , there are a lot of little ones . Every time Christ comes into someones heart , Christ has come again .

Bullshit , whoever backs em best , is just afraid the stupid things area The part about spending $ 5000-7000 on repairs reminds me of an article I read in a magazine comparing the 5 year ownership costs of a Toyota Camry and a Ford Taurus or something like that . The result , which they announced with great flourish was that it cost the same at the end of the period . That was their argument to prove that you do n't go wrong buying the Ford Taurus over the Camry . Now , if I remember correctly , the Camry costs about $ 4000 or so more in initial costs . Essentially , it means that you spend about $ 4000 extra on repairs on the Taurus . That is ridiculous . Every time your car needs repairs , it is extra hassles , loss of time and a dozen other things . I would much rather spend $ 5000 more in initial costs than spend $ 4000 more in repair costs . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - > 8 Cut here for Signature ! 8 < -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Balaji Ramanathan , | Institute of Transportation Studies , | I do n't believe in luck !

Are you your own master ? Do you have any habits that you can not break ? For one , you seem unable to master your lack of desire to understand even the slightest concept of the Bible . Seems that ignorance has you mastered . How about sexual sins ? Got ta any of those secret desires in your head that you harbor but can get control of ? Do you dehumanize women when they walk past you ? Do you degrade them to a sex object in your head ? Are you the master of that kind of thinking ?

I have admitted to myself that I can not control every aspect of my being . There are times I know I should n't say something , but then say it anyway . There are times I simply forget a lesson . I , in fact , am not my own master . I need help . Jesus promised me this help . And I took him up on his offer . I have willfully let Jesus be my master because Jesus knows what is better for me than I myself do . And why not ? Does not the creator know his creation better than the creation ?

And that was the issue . Your made-up theism is what it is -- made up . It's wishful thinking . > Nope -- most people are Christian . Most people are fond of feeling > that they are imperfect , of believing that the world is an undesirable > place , of reciting magical mystical prayers to make the world nice and > holy again , of doing just as their priests tell them , like good little > sheep . You enjoy darkness , and you 're proud of it . Is this the religion of Kendigianism ? Most people are not Christian . Most people , including Christians , are not fond of feeling that they are imperfect . Is `` the world an undesireable place '' a doctrine of Kendigianism ? It has nothing to do with my God . Does Kendigism have magical mystical prayers as a part of its worship ? Mine does n't . Does Kendigianism believe that the world will be holy again ? Mine does n't . Does Kendigianism also dictate that one must obey what the priest tells them like good little sheep ? Mine does n't . Is this a bunch of lies you tell yourself so that you can justify being ignorant of the Bible ? Brian , following Christ has nothing to do with the doctrines of Kendigianism . You would find any of your doctrines in the Bible . I do n't follow Kendigianism . I follow Christ . Also , to try to again show you your ignorance of Christ and the Bible in regards to `` priests '' , have you not read about the sole Melchizedek priest in Hebrews 7 and 8 ? Have you not read what the purpose is of the Old Testament Levitical priesthood and why there should NOT be priests today ? Yes , guess what ? The Catholics messed up . I do not follow Catholicism or any `` ism . '' I follow Christ . > Nope . You make decisions , enjoy your successes , and accept your > failures ; then you die .

The clear middle ground implied by these statements is to say that Americans have the right to Clipper encryption , but not to unbreakable encryption .

If the government continues on this course , I imagine that we will see strong cryptography made illegal . Encryption programs for disk files and email , as well as software to allow for encrypted voice communications , will be distributed only through the '' underground '' .

I 'll add here that any falsification or rejection does not in any way reduce its current usefulness . So long as it accurately predicts or describes things we can observe . Not to be a pain in the ass , but is there any reason you don't just say _the theory of evolution_ rather than the _fact of evolution is still a theory_ . I 'm asking because this whole thread got started because I was bothered by a post that referred to _the fact of evolution_ , basically leaving off the phrase _is still a theory_ . Without a clarification , like the one you just gave , just saying _the fact of evolution_ has a very different meaning to me . > > [ description of atomic theory , and alternative theories of gravity , deleted ] > > Both are very useful models that > > have no religious overtones or requirements of faith , unless of course you > > want to demand that it is a factual physical entity described exactly > > the way the theory now formulated talks about it . > > Here is where you fail to make an important distinction .

Again , it may be because I feel stronger about separating terms . I was trying to say that the _theories_ proposed to explain the _mechanisms_ and the _mechanisms_ themselves are the only realities here . It is the existence of mechanisms , not the things themselves , that are so predictive as to be considered fact ( as you would say ) . There are n't really little planetary particle systems called atoms out there . Or I should say , and more to my original point , it would be a leap of faith to say there are , because we observe only the mechanisms . There is no need to _believe_ there are _actually_ atoms out there as we have decided to think about them . It 's enough to discuss the mechanisms . At any rate , I 'm not sure I am being any clearer than before , but I thought it was worth a shot . The bottom line , though , is I think we agree on two fundamental ideas : 1 . -- evolution is a theory supported by observational evidence ( my way ) -- the fact of evolution is a theory supported by observational evidence ( your way ) 2 . -- creation is just an opinion . If a theist wants to call it a theory then he can . I wo n't : it has no supporting evidence and it neither predicts nor supports any observations that can be made . With no mechanisms to talk about , there really isn't much to say .

We tried to ship an X server once that only supported a 24bit TrueColor visual . The main problems we encountered were : 1 ) Clients written with logic like the following : if ( DefaultDepth ( ) ! = 1 ) /* Assume default depth is 8bit */ These clients need an 8bit deep visual in the root window to run correctly . 2 ) Other clients did n't even bother to do that much , and just outright assumed they had a *dynamic* visual class , with a dynamic colormap . XStoreColors does n't work on cmaps associated with Static or TrueColor visual classes , but many clients do n't bother to check , they just start throwing XStoreColor calls at you . Though both are clearly client error , this is the case with so many clients that it 's easier for you to expose 8bit PseudoColor as a default root window visual , than it ever would be for all these client writers to change their clients to do the right thing . -- -paul pmartz @ dsd.es.com Evans & Sutherland

I would echo that question . I 'm not trying to be contentious . But assuming that the Pope has universal jurisdiction and authority , what authority do you rely upon for your decisions ? What prevents me from choosing ANY doctrine I like and saying that Papal disagreement is an error that will be resolved in time ? This is especially true , since Councils of Bishops have basically stood by the Pope . The ultimate question is the traditional theology of the Church . This is the *only* thing that it is possible to resist a Pope for : his departure from the traditional doctrine of the Church . If commands from *any* authority conflict with Tradition , the commands must be disobeyed . My own view on this is that this conflict could only happen in a major way . God would never allow a hair-splitting situation to develop ; it would be too complex for people to figure out . I do n't view the present situation in the Church as anything extremely complicated . Run through a list of what has happened in the last 30 years in the Catholic Church , and any impartial observer will be aghast . It appears that much of what lies at the heart of this matter is disagreements over what is tradition and Tradition , and also over authority and discipline . The problems stem from a general widespread ignorance of the Catholic Faith , in my opinion . Most Catholics know about zilch about the Catholic Faith ; this leaves them wide open for destruction by erring bishops . It 's basically the Reformation part II . There is not even a question in my mind that in some respects the shards of the Catholic Church are currently being trampled upon by the Catholic hierarchy . I could go on listing shocking things for an hour , probably . Take the situation in Campos , Brazil , for example . I 'm reading a book on what happened there after Vatican Council II . The bishop , Antonio de Castro-Mayer , never introduced all the changes that followed in the wake of Vatican II . He kept the traditional Mass , the same old catechisms , etc . He made sure the people knew their faith , the Catholic theology of obedience , what Modernism was , etc . He innoculated the people against what was coming . Well , one day the order came from Rome for his retirement . It came when the Pope was sick . Bishop de Castro-Mayer waited until the Pope recovered , then inquired whether this command was what the Pope really wanted , or something that some Liberal had commanded in his absence . The Pope confirmed the decision . So the good bishop retired . The injustice that followed was completely incredible . A new bishop was installed . He proceeded to expel most of bishop de Castro-Mayer's clergy from their churches , because they refused to celebrate the New Mass . The new bishop would visit a parish , and celebrate a New Mass . The people would promptly walk out of the church en masse . The bishop was *enraged* by this . He usually resorted to enlisting the help of the secular authorities to eject the priest from the church . The priests would just start building new churches ; the people were completely behind them . The old parishes had the New Mass , as the bishop desired -- and virtually no parishioners . The prime motivation for all this was completely illegal , according to canon law . No priest can be penalized in any way for saying the traditional Mass , because of legislation enacted by Pope Saint Pius V. Nor is there any obligation to say the New Mass . During all this process , the people of Campos , not just private individuals , but including civil authorities , were constantly sending petitions and letters to Rome to do something about the new Modernist bishop . NOTHING was ever done ; no help ever arrived from Rome . Eventually 37 priests were kicked out , and about 40,000 people . My question to the supporters of SSPX is this : Is there ANY way that your positions with respect to church reforms could change and be conformed to those of the Pope ? ( assuming that the Pope 's position does not change and that the leaders of SSPX do n't jointly make such choice . ) If not , this appears to be claiming infallible teaching authority . If I adopt the view that `` I 'm NOT wrong , I CA N'T be wrong , and there 's NO WAY I 'll change my mind , YOU must change yours '' , that I 've either left the Catholic Church or it has left me . If the Pope defines certain things ex cathedra , that would be the end of the controversy . That process is all very well understood in Catholic theology , and anyone who does n't go along with it is an instant non-Catholic . The problem here is that people do not appreciate what is going on in the Catholic world . If they knew the Faith , and what our bishops are doing , they would be shocked ! We sould argue from now until the Second Coming about what the `` real '' traditional teaching of the Church is . If this were a simple matter East and West would not have been separated for over 900 years . This is n't the case in the Catholic Church . There is a massive body of traditional teaching . The Popes of the last 150 years are especially relevant . There is no question at all what the traditional doctrine is . I thought that the teaching magisterieum of the church did not allow error in teachings regarding faith and morals even in the short term. ` I may be wrong here , I 'm not Roman Catholic . : - ) That 's heresy , more or less . Although they have done a great job since the Reformation , the last 30 years have seen so many errors spread that it 's pitiful . Infallibility rests in the Pope , and in the Church as a whole . In the short term , a Pope , or large sections of the Church can go astray . In fact , that 's what usually happens during a major heresy : large sections of the Church go astray . ( The Pope historically has been much more reliable . ) Everything will always come back in the long run . What would be the effect of a Pope making an ex cathedra statement regarding the SSPX situation ? Would it be honored ? If not , how do you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility ? Again , I 'm not trying to be contentions , I 'm trying to understand . Since I 'm Orthodox , I 've got no real vested interest in the outcome , one way or the other . Yes , it would be honored . Infallibility is infallibility . But what is he going to define ? That the New Mass is a better expression of the Catholic Faith than the old ? That sex education in the Catholic schools is wonderful ? That all religions are wonderful except for that professed by the Popes prior to Vatican II ? It does if the command was legitimate . SSPX does not view the Pope 's commands as legitimate . Why ? This is a VERY slippery slope . Not really ; start studying the major Catholic theologians of the last 300 years . Everything is very well spelled out . The West excels at critical thought , remember ? That 's what Catholic theologians have been busy at for centuries .

This day marked the first testimony of the trial . Deputy U.S . Marshal Larry Cooper took the stand for the prosecution . The short version is that his testimony was consistent with the opening statements for the prosecution . Cooper testified that he had arrived in Spokane ( Washington ) on August 17 , 1992 to participate in a surveillance operation with five other deputies near the Weaver cabin . The team was using night vision equipment for surveillance , and split up into two teams of three people . The six later met at an observation point above the cabin . After this , deputies Cooper , William Degan , and Arthur Roderick began a descent to scout further possible surveillance sites . Cooper told the court that Roderick threw two large rocks into a gully to see , `` whether the [ Weaver family ] dogs would respond . '' Striker , the Weaver 's yellow lab , started toward them barking loudly . Roderick led the three in a run from the area . They ran through some dense woods into an open area [ called the '' fern field '' ] with the dog in pursuit . By this time , Kevin Harris and Samuel Weaver had joined the chase . The surveillance team had reached a Y in the road : Cooper decided that they should take cover in the woods because otherwise they would be an easy target and might be `` shot in the back . '' As Degan reached the Y , he spotted Randy Weaver coming down the road from the cabin ahead . Weaver was startled but did not fire . At this moment , Striker reached Degan , and Cooper had to `` fend him off with his gun . '' [ It is unclear whether this means he clubbed the dog or shot the dog ] . Both Cooper and Degan then took cover in the woods . According to Cooper , Kevin Harris and Samuel Weaver continued walking down the road , apparently not noticing the two . After they had passed by on the road , Degan got up on one knee , raised his gun , and shouted , `` Stop ! U.S . Marshal ! '' Harris then `` ... brought the weapon around at hip level and fired . He did n't bring the weapon up to eye level . I saw Bill 's arm going back , and I knew he had been hit . '' Cooper fired at Harris , and Harris went down . Cooper then brought his weapon to bear on Samuel , but did not fire . At this point , Cooper then heard two shots to his right . Samuel Weaver looked in the direction of the shots , yelled , `` You son of a bitch ! '' and ran toward them . Cooper then realized that shots were coming at him from directly ahead , so he fired a three-round burst at the cabin . At this point he then saw Samuel Weaver running toward the cabin . When Cooper reached Degan , he placed his first two fingers on Degan carotid artery , counted two or three beats , and then his heart stopped . Shortly thereafter , Roderick and the other three marshals joined him . They then all heard a large burst of gunfire from the area around the cabin . On cross-examination , David Nevin questioned the point of throwing rocks into the gulley , asking , `` You wanted to lure that dog out so you could shoot that dog , did n't you ? '' Nevin also pointed out that in last September 's testimony , Cooper had claimed that he spotted Weaver after the dog had left him . Cooper claimed that he had gone over the events in his head and decided that Thursday 's account was correct . Nevin continued the cross-examination by asking what Cooper would have done had an armed man dressed in full camouflage jumped out of the woods at him [ no answer was available ] . Friday , April 16 marks continued cross-examination of Cooper . Notes : There was no coverage of protestors .

The Arabs that lived along the coast in Western Palestine , later to be called Israel , were shafted by their brother Arabs just as they've been shafted for decades since then by their Arab bretheren .

Another way to figure out the difference between the `` user '' window position and the window manager decoration window position is to subtract their positions .

The willingness of the majority of the people to give up their freedom in exchange for a sense of safety is hardly limited to the USA , and is an endemic problem in any human society of any appreciable size . The structure of the US government does try to combat this tendency to some extent , but fighting entropy is always a losing battle . Most people would rather have comfort than freedom . The paradox is that you ca n't really have the former , in the long term , unless you have the latter . One of the reasons that I probably come across to some people as a weird cross between a libertarian and an `` establishment tool '' is that I end up taking an utterly pragmatic view of government . I do n't get up in arms when the government fails to protect the interests of the people , because in my lifetime it never has -- therefore , I have no expectation that it will . As a result , I protect my own interests rather than expecting the government to be `` fair '' . I will use strong cryptography when I think it is needed , whether or not it is legal at the time . Same thing with anything else the government would rather not see in private hands -- that 's their problem . What 's important to me is using the right tool for the job . If it 's legal , so much the better . If it is not , but does not violate my ( very strong ) sense of personal ethics , I will use it anyway as long I think it is worth it . Expecting the government to actually protect the interests of its citizens , except by accident , is utter folly . Even Jefferson , one of the major architects of the American system of government , figured that in a couple hundred years it would become so corrupt and self-serving that it would be time dismantle it and try again , by revolution if necessary . I agree , and while I do n't go around trying to spark one , I 'll certainly participate if it happens when I 'm around . There is a reason I am such a strong supporter of individual rights while being so cynical about politics . I 've already written off politics . And yes , this may get me in trouble some day . If so , so be it . I drive faster than 55 MPH , too . Amanda Walker InterCon Systems Corporation

Well , suffice to say that it is a sport for those able to make the substantial investment in equipment , etc . But here 's something , do you think that the availability of in-line skates and road hockey could contribute to a rise in awareness of ice hockey ? I would argue this is having an effect here . Kids play ice hockey in the winter and road hockey in the summer with in-line skates .

'Easter ' is a pagan word all right , but it has nothing to do with Ishtar . If 'Easter ' and 'Ishtar ' were related , their history would show it . But in Old English , Easter was 'Eostre ' , cognate with English 'East' and German 'Ost ' . The reconstructed Proto-Germanic form is 'Austron ' . Not until after 1400 did 'Easter ' have a high front vowel like 'Ishtar ' . Clearly , the two words have quite separate origins .

Rather than decide which book you want to buy , you need to decide which programming interface you want to use , then buy the appropriate book . I wrote an article for the X Resource which discusses the differences between PHIGS and PEXlib ( it will appear in Issue 6 which should be out pretty soon ) . But here 's a brief summary ... PHIGS is a graphics API which was designed to be portable to many devices . Most implementations support the X Window System and take advantage of a 3D extension to X called `` PEX '' . PEXlib is a slightly '' lower '' level API which was designed to efficiently support the PEX extension to X . Some advantages of using PEXlib ... - Integrates with Xlib , Xt , Motif , etc . better than PHIGS - Provides immediate mode capabilities - Is free of `` policy '' - PEX supports PHIGS , but is currently being extended to support features not found in PHIGS ( like texture mapping , anti-aliasing ) . PEXlib will give you access to all of these features . Some advantages of using PHIGS ... - Support for multiple devices , not just X based ones - Support for archiving , metafiles , hardcopy output - PHIGS has predefined input devices to make input easier - PHIGS can handle exposure events and resizing for you - PHIGS can help you with colormap selection/creation . If you 're working strictly in X and do n't care about things like archiving , I would go with PEXlib . Either way , you will find that both API 's have a lot in common . Ralph Mor MIT X Consortium

V_ reprinted here with absolutely no permission from anyone . `` We plan ... to have a full size ( 40 binary digit ) word hold either contain 1 full size number ( ... equivalent to 12 decimal digits , but we will use the first binary digit to denote the sign ) or two ( 20 binary digit ) orders . ... . It should be added that this technique of automatic substitutions into orders , i.e . the machine 's ability to modify its own orders ( under the control of other ones among its orders ) is absolutely necessary for a flexible code . Thus , if part of the memory is used as a `` function table '' , then '' looking up '' a value of that function for a value of the variable which is obtained in the course of the computation requires that the machine itself should modify , or rather make up , the reference to the memory in the order which controls this `` looking up '' , and the machine can only make this modification after it has already calculated the value of the variable in question . On the other hand , this ability of the machine to modify its own orders is one of the things which makes coding the non-trivial operation which we have to view it as .

Would n't a crystal be affected by cold ? My gut feeling is that , as a > mechanically resonating device , extreme cold is likely to affect the > compliance ( ? terminology ? ) of the quartz , and hence its resonant frequency . Low power quartz oscillators are usually 32 kHz ( and THESE have significant temperature drifts , which one does n't often notice while wearing the watch on one 's wrist ) . Low temperature sensitivity is available in other crystal types , which unfortunately are larger and higher frequency ( 1 MHz or so ) and take more battery power . Programmable timers might be less accurate , but they are more power-stingy than suitable crystal oscillators . John Whitmore

From : wtm @ uhura.neoucom.edu ( Bill Mayhew ) Subject : Re : electronic odometers ( was : Used BMW Question ... .. ? ? ? ) Organization : Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine Lines : 32 I consulted with someone working on an electronic odometer . The design was to use a microprocessor based system to write a somewhat ofuscated pattern into an EEPROM . The idea was to make the circuit difficult to program arbitrary values into the EEPROM . The secondary purpose , acutally the primary purpose from the standpoint of practicality , was to distributed the writes so as to avoid exceeing the maximum number of writes fof the EEPROM being used . The microprocessor also ignored pulses coming from the Hall effect at a rate any higher than 110 MPH so as to make spoofing the reading by bench pulsing at least somewhat undesirable . This was for an automobile that was not expected to ever exceed 110 MPH in operation . The case , of course , might not be the same for your 1993 RX-7 ! The ECM modules of some cars do indeed store info about conditions under which cars have been operated . Since steering angle and velocity data , etc is available it would not be difficult to collect all sorts of interesting demographic information about the drivers ' use of the car . I am not aware of any manufacturer currently trying to enforce warranty restrictions based on reading out use data from the ECM . While it could be a potential invasion of your privacy for manufacturers to have access to data about your driving style , it could also provide valuable information from actual field use conditions to help engineer more appropriate cars .

Bubblejets often splatter a little bit , whereas LaserJets ( given half-way decent toner , like HP 's `` Microfine '' stuff ) do n't . Both produce very good output , but you do n't have to look too closely at the two to tell that LaserJet output is definitely superior . On the other hand , LaserJets which have n't been maintained properly and use the cheapest toner the owner could find often produce awful output , much worse than a bubblejet . : - ) One other thing ... there are bubblejets , and then there are BubbleJets . There are a few bubblejets out there that produce rather mediocre output ( such as HP 's dinky little BubbleJet ) , whereas most produce really good looking output ( such as HP 's DeskJets ) .

My goal is for this keyboard to look exactly like an AT sytle keyboard to its host system . This will be a highly endowed keyboard with a Little PCL from Z World at its heart . The only thing I lack is detailed information on the hardware signaling that the 486 ( with Windows 3.1 and DOS 5.0 ) will be expecting . My project is independant of Windows , my hope is that some of you fellow Window 's users/programmers will recognize what I need and be willing to point me in the right direction . I have The Winn L. Rosch Hardware Bible ( 2nd edition ) . The HB gives most ( if not all ) of the information I will need concerning scan codes and even a wire diagram for the PS/2 style connector I will need , but it leaves a number of important questions unanswered . 1 . Is it synchronous or asynchronous serial communication ? I'm guessing synchronous since the host is providing a clock . In either event , how is the data framed ? 2 . Is it half-duplex or truly one way ? I 'm guessing half-duplex since the host can turn LEDs on and off . 3 . Are there any chipsets available for communicating with the `` AT keyboard standard '' ( other than by cannibalizing a real keyboard ) ? If anyone knows of a book or article ( or any other written source of information ) on the above , please advise me at gamet @ erg.sri.com .

Maybe PC Magazine , January 12 , 1993 had a review of several personal finance management programe , as did PC-Computing , January 1993 . PC World , December 1992 also had articles about Quicken and Managing Your Money . I can email you copies of these articles if you ca n't find them at your library . I 've been using Managing Your Money for several years , and I have several friends who use Quicken , though I 've not used it myself . My overall impression is that Quicken is a financial accounts manager while Managing Your Money will help you more completely manage your finances . Here are some features that I believe Managing Your Money and Quicken share : The ability to keep records for each of your financial accounts : checking , savings , charge , cash , or brokerage . You can reconcile your account statements with the records the program keeps . The ability to make a budget and track your spending against that budget . A Checkfree module which will allow you to use the Checkfree bill paying service to pay your bills via your modem . The ability to print checks on your printer . The ability to keep loan records and set up automatic loan payments . The ability to import stock quotations to keep your brokerage accounts up to date . I know Managing Your Money can do this automatically via modem . Quicken probably can as well , but I 'm not sure about it . The ability to export tax information to popular tax preparation programs . Here are some features that I believe Managing Your Money has that Quicken does not : A tax prediction module . This looks at your accounts and budget to predict your tax liability for the coming year . It 's usefull to fine tune your withholding so Uncle Sam does n't get his due too early . An insurance and vital records module . This is a place to keep records of your insurance policies as well as other vital records . It can also compute your life expectancy . A financial analysis module . This computes compound interest , effects of inflation , loan payments term or interest , yield to maturity for bonds , savings account yields , days between dates , and loan amortization schedules . It also has functions to help you decide whether to refinance your mortgage , whether you can afford a particular home , whether a particular rental property is a good investment , whether you should buy lease or rent , and whether a particular investment 's cash flow is adequate for your situation . This module can also help you plan for retirement and for helping your kids with their tuition . A net worth module . This is a place to record all your assets and liabilities . Your net worth can be computed from this information . Any assets or liabilities recorded in other modules are automatically included here . A `` desk '' module . This includes a small word processor , a card file you can use to store names , addresses , phone numbers and other vital information about friends and associates , a perpetual calander , a rudimentary calculator , a to-do list , a reminder list , an appointment list , and a place to record your phone calls ( for those who need to track such things ) . Your appointments , reminders and to-do list can be made to display automatically when you start the program . There are probably some things listed above that Quicken has , but I 'm almost sure that Quicken does n't do everything I 've listed . If I 'm wrong , I 'm sure hordes of Quicken devotees will flame me to a crisp . One thing that Quicken has that Managing Your Money does not yet have is a Windows version . MECA software is rumored to be working on a Windows version of Managing Your Money for release late this year . I hope this information is of use to you . I 've found Managing Your Money to be a very usefull program for keeping my financial records . On the other hand I know many people who are equally as happy with Quicken . If Quicken has all the features you need or want , I 'd go with it . If you find any of the Managing Your Money features that Quicken does n't have to be useful , I think it 's well worth the price .

Organization : Free University of Berlin , Germany Lines : 41 Cc : u9126619 @ athmail1.causeway.qub.ac.uk I 've heard it said that the accounts we have of Christs life and ministry in the Gospels were actually written many years after the event . ( About 40 years or so ) . Is this correct ? ? If so , why the big time delay ? ? I know all scripture is inspired of God , so the time of writing is I suppose un-important , but I still ca n't help be curious ! -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Ivan Thomas Barr Contact me at u9126619 @ athmail1.causeway.qub.ac.uk [ The Gospels are n't dated , so we can only guess . Luke 's prolog is about the only thing we have from the author describing his process . The prolog sounds like Luke is from the next generation , and had to do some investigating . There are traditions passed down verbally that say a few things about the composition of the Gospels . There are debates about how reliable these traditions are . They certainly don't have the status of Scripture , yet scholars tend to take some of them seriously . One suggests that Mark was based on Peter 's sermons , and was written to preserve them when Peter had died or way about to die . One tradition about Matthew suggests that a collection of Jesus words may have been made earlier than the current Gospels . In the ancient world , it was much more common to rely on verbal transmission of information . I think many people would have preferred to hear about Jesus directly from someone who had known him , and maybe even from someone who studied directly under such a person , rather than from a book . Thus I suspect that the Gospels are largely from a period when these people were beginning to die . Scholars generally do think there was some written material earlier , which was probably used as sources for the existing Gospels . Establishing the dates is a complex and technical business . I have to confess that I 'm not sure how much reliance I 'd put on the methods used . But it 's common to think that Mark was written first , around 64 AD. , and that all of the Gospels were written by the end of the Century . A few people vary this by a decade or so one way or the other . -- clh ]

Organization : Indiana University Computer Science , Bloomington Lines : 27 This might be a silly question but I have to ask it anyway . I am in the process of purchasing an EISA/VL Bus 486 DX2-66 computer and I found two places that sell machines that have what I want and have the same price . The first is Ares and they use a Cache motherboard ( that's the brand of the motherboard ) with OPTI chip set , the other is Micron ( formerly Edge Technology ) and they use the Micronics EISA/VLB motherboard . I said that this might be a silly question since I believe that Micronics is a very well known motherboard manufacturer while I never heard of Cache ! I am however leaning towards the Ares machine because my impression is that they are known for building good , solid machines and they have good tech support ( 24 hr , 7 days/wk ) , and a better warrantee ( 2 years ) . Micron , on the other hand , seems to have recently aquired Edge Technologies and I 'm not sure how much I should trust the company . I would REALLY appreciate any input on this . Is the Micron machine the clear choice ? Does anyone know anything positive or negative about either company ? Has anyone ever heard of Cache motherboards ? Should I go with Micron just because it has the Micronics motherboard ? etc . Thanks very much in advance for any information . -- Mohammad Al-Ansari

I do n't think anyone is arguing that there would be no effect . But there would be no _net_ _positive_ effect . You also have to consider the negative side : Law abiding citizens , armed with fireamrs ( pistols for the most part ) , prevent between 80,000 ( National Crime Survey ) and 1,000,000 ( Dr. Kleck ) crimes each year . ( Those are the extremes . Most studies find the number to be 500,000 to 600,000 . ) About 1 % of those crimes are homicides , so private ownership of firearms _saves_ approximately 5,000 lives each year . There are roughly 12,000 criminal homicides and fatal accidents involving guns each year . For there to be any net benefit , you would have to show that gun control measures would disarm over 40 % of the criminals currently using guns . That would be very hard to do : According the the federal BATF , only 8 % of criminals buy their guns over the counter . Since gun control laws , by their very nature , only effect legal sales , such a law would remove all the benefits of armed , law-abiding citizens while having only a minimal effect on armed criminals ( who , by and large , get their guns illegally . ) That does n't sound like a net benefit to me . > ...

Since most were with licensed weapons , I assume you are not supporting `` reasonable '' laws ( i.e . waiting periods , background checks , licenses , etc ... ) .

Meanwhile , I think bigger accomplishments of Simmons ' tenure were getting some value for John Smiley , not trading real prospects for veterans down the stretch last year , drafting well in 1992 , letting the rookies show something in 1993 . Foley , Smith , and Candelaria were acquired to be replacement parts , which means that even if fail it has n't done serious damage to the Bucs ' future . > 14 ) Compensatory draft picks for Bonds : Forget it .

I 'm not sure who was the idiot in this case , so I do n't know who to blame . It might have been Doug Danforth , after all .

Why would anyone talk about Gainey ? `` I hate the Habs '' ? ... you sound like a 10-year old . This statement is just further exemplifies your total inability to argue objectively about hockey . Do n't give me this crap about '' cogent arguments '' ... I 've yet to read something of yours that is cogent . You consistently argue with : ( 1 ) emotion ; ( 2 ) huge , sweeping statements Frankly , you have a very unconvincing style . I 'm not defending Bob Gainey ... frankly , I do n't care for him all that much . But your dismissal of him as something less than an effective hockey player is tiresome ... it has no basis in anything . How many Calders did he win ? I think it was four ( go ahead and refresh my memory ) . What about the Conn Smythe ? Was that a fluke ? Yeah , not the makings of a hockey superstar , I know , but try to have a reason , any reason , to shoot him down . > > > go around . Who would you rather have as your `` checking '' > > > centre ?

OH MY GOD ! ! ! Did I say that ? Roger ... what 's your point ? Fuhr is a goaltender , goaltender 's do n't `` plug '' ... in his prime , he was one of the best .

The Flyers won two cups for the same reasons ... deservedly so . So what ? I do n't get it . Are you angry that the Leafs did n't get more recognition ? You seem to think these pluggers are `` hyped '' ... I don't agree ... plain and simple .

Logic alert - artificial trifercation . The are many other possible explainations . Could have been that he never existed . There have been some good points made in this group that is not impossible that JC is an amalgam of a number of different myths , Mithra comes to mind . - > Some reasons why he would n't be a liar are as follows .

Logic alert - argument from incredulity . Just because it is hard for you to believe this doesn't mean that it is n't true . Liars can be very pursuasive , just look at Koresh that you yourself site . He has followers that do n't think he is a fake and they have shown that they are willing to die . By not giving up after getting shot himself , Koresh has shown that he too is will to die for what he believes . As far as healing goes . If I rememer right the healing that was attributed is not consistent between the different gospels . In one of them the healing that is done is not any more that faith healers can pull off today . Seems to me that the early gospels were n't that compeling , so the stories got bigger to appeal better . - > Niether was he a lunatic . Would more than an entire nation be drawn - > to someone who was crazy . Very doubtful , in fact rediculous .

Or might not have existed , or any number of things . That is the logical pitfall that those who use flawed logic like this fall into . There are bifurcations ( or tri , quad , etc ) that are valid , because in the proceeding steps , the person shows conclusively that the alternatives are all that are possible . Once everyone agrees that the given set is indeed all there are , then arguments among the alternatives can be presentent , and one mostly likely to be true can be deduced by excluding all other possible alternatives . However , if it can be shown that the set is not all inclusive , then any conclusions bases on the incomplete set are invalid , even if the true choice is one of the original choices . I have given at least one valid alternative , so the conclusion that JC is the real McCoy just because he is n't one of the other two alternative is no longer valid . - > Some other things to note .

It would n't be any great shakes to make sure one does a list of actions that would fullfill prophecy . What would be compeling is if there were a set of clear and explicit prophecies AND JC had absolutely NO knowledge of then , yet fullfilled them anyway . - > I do n't think most people understand what a Christian is .

Here I agree with you . Anyone who buys into this load of mythology should take what it says seriously , and what it says is that it must be a total way of life . I have very little respect for Xians that do n't . If the myth is true , then it is true in its entirity . The picking and choosing that I see a lot of leaves a bad taste in my mouth .
