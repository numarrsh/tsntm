GANDLER ) writes : > > How does the radio Electronics free information cards work . > Do they just send you some general information about the companies that > advertise in their magazine or does it also give you sign you up for a > catalog . That depends entirely upon the advertiser whose number you circled . Radio Electronics compiles all of the cards , then each advertiser gets a computer printout of the names and addresses of all of the readers who circled their number . Some magazines also provide the data on self-adhesive labels , and the really big magazines provide the data on computer disk . The advertiser decides what to do with the data they get . You will notice that the Radio Electronics information card ( commonly called a `` bingo card '' in the industry ) includes lines for a company name and a business phone number . My guess would be that the big , national advertisers make a distinction between hobbiests and professionals as best they can . For example , if you include Motorola as your company and include a business phone ( and a mail stop ) , Tektronics will probably send you a copy of their hard-bound catalog and have a sales engineer call you about a week later . If you leave it blank , odds are they will send you a slick brochure and direct you to a local retail outlet . Medium and small companies are more likely to send you th e whole catalog . And then some companies , like Digikey or Jameco , have nothing to mail out accept the catalog . A couple of other interesting points about bingo cards : Free , industry magazines like EDN and such also log your card to their computer . They use the information at least three ways . They note that you really do read the magazine and are more likely to continue your subscription or push you , through repeated mailings , to re-subscribe . They also compile how many people requested which data for their marketing demographics . This way thay can tell a prospective advertiser that `` 23 % of readers requesting data were interested in capacitors . '' And finally , some magazines rent lists of readers who request certain information . For example , Tektronics can rent a list of everyone who requested information about test equipment OTHER THAN TEKTRONIC 's , in the past 6 months . The other point , in the data the advertiser receives , many magazines include how many items you circled on the card . If they want , the advertiser can attempt to cull out the `` literature collectors '' from the serious potential customers . `` Can you say qualified sales leads ? I thought you could . '' What 's the BEST way for a hobbiest to deal with bingo cards ? Never circle more than 8 number on the card . If you want more than 8 items , use the second card and mail it a couple of weeks later . If you are really , really serious and you really , really want the information , CALL THE ADVERTISER AND ASK ! This will also cut about 15 days off the the response time . Virtually everyone takes a voice on the phone more seriously than data on a computer printout . To help insure you keep getting a trade magazine that you're not really `` qualified '' for , send in a bingo card at least every other month and circle two or three numbers . Include a business name and phone number , even if it 's your house . Advertisers almost never call .

That 's like saying that , since mathematics includes no instructions on how to act , it is evil . Atheism is not a moral system , so why should it speak of instructions on how to act ? *Atheism is simply lack of belief in God* . Plenty of theists > think so . So one could argue the case for `` atheism causes whatever > I did n't like about the former USSR '' with as much validity as `` theism > causes genocide '' - that is to say , no validity at all . I think the argument that a particular theist system causes genocide can be made more convincingly than an argument that atheism causes genocide . This is because theist systems contain instructions on how to act , and one or more of these can be shown to cause genocide . However , since the atheist set of instructions is the null set , how can you show that atheism causes genocide ? -- David Choweller ( davec @ silicon.csci.csusb.edu ) There are scores of thousands of human insects who are ready at a moment 's notice to reveal the Will of God on every possible subject . -- George Bernard Shaw . -- There are scores of thousands of human insects who are ready at a moment 's notice to reveal the Will of God on every possible subject . -- George Bernard Shaw .

From : sera @ zuma.UUCP ( Serdar Argic ) Subject : The scenario and genocide staged by the Armenians 78 years ago . Reply-To : sera @ zuma.UUCP ( Serdar Argic ) Distribution : world Lines : 72 The scenario and genocide staged by the Armenians 78 years ago in x-Soviet Armenia is being reenacted again - this time in Azerbaijan . The stories of survivors of Karabag massacre are in 'Milliyet ' today . 69 year old Hatin Nine telling : - '' My Twin grandchildren were cut to pieces in front of my eyes . They told me : We wo n't kill you . But the babies have to die in front of your eyes . '' 72 year old Huseyin Ibrahimoglu : - `` Our Turkish village in Khojalu Town was blown up in two hours . While killing children and babies mercilessly they said : You are Turks , you must die . '' 28 year old Gulsum Huseyin : - `` They bayonetted my 3 year old daughter in her stomach in front of my eyes . '' Are these stories lies ? Have the eye-witnesses been day-dreaming ? Were these stories forged by Turkish journalists in the region ? The nonsense of such a claim is clear from the writings of British Journalists , too . Two days before we had quoted from a Sunday Times article . They [ British ] reported the events in Karabag even before Turkish journalists . What is more here are the pictures . Pictures of people who were bayonetted , whose eyes were gouged , ears cut off . Even the Armenian Radio could n't claim these `` lies . '' They are saying '' exaggeration . '' That means `` somethings '' have happened but the situation is not as bad as reported . Perhaps that village of Khojalu town was destroyed in 4 hours , instead of 2 ... Or Gulsum Huseyin's 3 year old daughter was bayonetted in her chest instead of stomach ... The massacre is clearly seen with all its dimensions . The effects of this massacre on Karabag and environs can not be reduced by any word . Some of the western press ' , led by some French Newspapers , ability to `` close their eyes '' is nothing but complicity in this massacre . Yesterday we gave samples from Le Figaro . Until yesterday 's print no news about the real events in Karabag were printed . So were the French TV channels.. The subject they considered related to Karabag was `` The necessity of protecting Armenians against Azeri attacks . '' The age we are living in is termed a human rights age . There are lots of organizations such as United Nations and CSCE ( Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe ) , and rules , all designed to fight against human rights violations . International reactions must be made with international cooperation . With support of everybody and every organization claiming to be civilized . Could there be a more serious human rights violation than that of the right to live -and with such levels of barbarity and cruelty- ? Where is the cooperation ? Where are the reactions ? And the intellectuals , journalists , writers , TV stations of certain western countries such as France who are fast to claim leadership of `` human rights ? '' Where are you ?

For the purposes of a contest , you 'll probably not compete if ' n you ca n't afford the ride to get there . And although lower priced delivery systems might be doable , without demand its doubtful that anyone will develop a new system . Course , if a low priced system existed , there might be demand ... I wonder if there might be some way of structuring a contest to encourage low cost payload delivery systems . The accounting methods would probably be the hardest to work out . For example , would you allow Rockwell to 'loan ' you the engines ? And so forth ... > Any plan for doing > sustained lunar exploration using existing launch systems is wasting > money in a big way . > This depends on the how soon the new launch system comes on line . In other words , perhaps a great deal of worthwhile technology ( life support , navigation , etc . ) could be developed prior to a low cost launch system . You would n't want to use the expensive stuff forever , but I 'd hate to see folks waiting to do anything until a low cost Mac , oops , I mean launch system comes on line . I guess I 'd simplify this to say that 'waste ' is a slippery concept . If your goal is manned lunar exploration in the next 5 years , then perhaps its not 'wasted ' money . If your goal is to explore the moon for under $ 500 million , then you should put of this exploration for a decade or so .

Well , yes and no . I do n't particularly want this discussion to spark a lengthy debate , but I do think it 's worth pointing out that `` popular usage '' is not always sufficient excuse . In this case , for example , I think an appropriate parallel may be found in the pronunciation of proper names : if people commonly misspelled or mispronounced your name , would you feel compelled to change it ? Probably not . The same is true of X . `` The X Window System '' , `` X '' , `` X11 '' , and related monickers are proper names in the same sense that any product name is a proper name . In fact , some of them are *trademarked* names . The fact that many people get them wrong is largely beside the point . As for the trade publications that promulgate things like `` X Window '' or '' X.windows '' or any of the other nonsensical variants one often sees , consider the fact that these publications are supposedly written by *journalists* . Would you trust the facts of a journalist who couldn't be bothered to get the name of his/her source right ? Would you trust a product review by someone who got the name of the product wrong ? Popular usage is as it may be , but I for one am all for holding people who claim to be journalists to a higher standard of correctness . > Indeed , the fact that X won out over NeWS > was really down to popular opinion ( I know , we all think it 's ( ! ) technically > superior as well ! ) .

I think that it is enough if his contemporaries found the result surprising . That 's not what I 'd quibble about . What I 'd like to know are Toricelli's reasons for doing his experiment ; not the post hoc _constructed_ reasons , but the thoughts in his head as he considered the problem . It may be impossible to know much about Toricelli 's thoughts ; that 's too bad if it is so . One of Root-Bernstein 's services to science is that he has gone rooting about in Pasteur 's and Fleming 's ( and other people 's ) notes , and has discovered some surprising clues about their motivations . Pasteur never publicly admitted his plan to create mirror-image life , but the dreams are right there in his notebooks ( finally public after many years ) , ready for anyone to read . And I and my friends often have the most ridiculous reasons for pursuing results ; one of my best came because I was mad at a colleague for a poorly-written claim ( I disproved the claim ) . Of course , Toricelli 's case may be an example of a rarety : where the fantasy not only motivates the experiment , but turns out to be right in the end . Mark -- Mark A.

Double jeopardy states that a person may not be tried twice on the same charge . However , the police are not on trial for the crime of excessive force or assault . They are NOW on trial for the DIFFERENT crime of violating Mr. King 's civil rights . AS for the city and county or state trying you more than once , it most likely will not happen .

I > should be surprised if the book you mention has any scholarly basis . Actually , there was very little to the book . First of all looking at the titles of her other books , I would personally consider her to be engaged in a bizarre form of Christian-like mysticism heavily influenced by eastern philosphies ( great titles like _The_Astrology_of_the_4_Horsemen_ ) . However , other than the Chapter One into , there 's nothing original , biased , or even new this book . It is basically a collection of previously published works by those who claim that there exist Buddhist and Hindu stories that Christ visited India and China ( he was known as Issa ) during the period from late teens to age 30 . Conclusion : the book actually lets you come to your own view by presenting a summary of various published works and letters , all of which you could verify independently . It includes refutations to such works as well . Therefore , even if you think she is theologically warped , this book is a nice reference summary for the interested . -- Rob Butera | ECE Grad Student | `` Only sick music makes money today '' Rice University | Houston , TX 77054 | - Nietzsche , 1888

The estimated population of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000 , of whom 940,000 ( 20 percent ) were Armenian , 1,200,000 ( 25 percent ) Georgian , and 2,220,000 ( 45 percent ) Moslem . Of the latter group , 1,140,000 were Tatars . Paradoxically , barely one-third of Transcaucasia 's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia , where the Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds . Erevan uezd , the administrative center of the province , had only 44,000 Armenians as compared to 68,000 Moslems . By the time of the Russian Census of 1897 , however , the Armenians had established a scant majority , 53 percent , in the guberniia ; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent , or 670,000 of the 1,120,000 inhabitants . This impressive change in the province 's ethnic character notwithstanding , there was , on the eve of the creation of the Armenian Republic , a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the southern districts , from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia . '' ( See also Map 1 . Historic Armenia and Map 4 . Administrative subdivisions of Transcaucasia ) . In 1920 , ' 0 ' percent Turk . `` We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work of extermination . Our troops surrounded village after village . Little resistance was offered . Our artillery knocked the huts into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable and inhabitants fled from them into fields , bullets and bayonets completed the work . Some of the Tartars escaped of course . They found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border into Turkey . The rest were killed . And so it is that the whole length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of Tartar villages . They are quiet now , those villages , except for howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the scattered bones of the dead . '' Ohanus Appressian `` Men Are Like That '' p. 202 .

The *only* reason alternative therapies are shunned by physicians is that their practitioners refuse to submit their theories to rigorous scientific scrutiny , insisting that `` tradition '' or anecdotal evidence are sufficient .

Disclaimer : This posting represents the poster 's views , not those of IBM Lines : 33 I suspect that this clipper thing could backfire on the Gov in a big hurry . I expect that products using these chips will socket them rather than soldering them , since once the keys are handed over by the escrow agencies , the chip is so much garbage , and will need to be replaced . I expect that someone will come along with a pin compatible chip that uses secure encryption -- possibly even disguised so that it's not possible to tell it from the clipper chip until you try to use the 2 backdoor keys . If I were to manufacture such a chip , as part of my marketing strategy , I would try to subvert one or both escrow agencies either through bribes or industrial espionage -- and then publicize the fact . ( doing my best not to be connected with such activities -- which would likely not be legal : - ) Publicly discrediting the escrow agencies would go quite far towards creating a market for a secure alternative . I also believe that someone will reverse engineer the clipper chip , and knowlege of the algorithm will likely be fairly widespread . Any back- doors or weaknesses would further discredit the scheme , and help grow the market demand for a secure alternative . I believe that the company that provides such an alternative will make few friends in the LE community , but lots of money . I also believe that the government will do it 's best to make such plug replacements illegal . I expect that they will see the same success in limiting the availability of such alternatives as they have seen in limiting the availability of certain illicit drugs -- ie . little to none .

EDT Q Mr. President , what do you think of Jesse Jackson 's protest today ? THE PRESIDENT : I think it 's an informational protest . I think it 's fine . The owners put out a statement few days ago , which they say was the first step in , you know , efforts to increase minority ownership and minority increases in management . I think we should . I 'm encouraged by Don Baylor 's appointment out in Colorado . And I think it 's time to make a move on that front . So , I think it 's a legitimate issue , and I think it 's -- like I said , it 's an informational picket and not an attempt to get people not to go to the game . So , I think it 's good . Q Do you think they 're moving fast enough ? THE PRESIDENT : Well , I think that it was a good first step . And I think you 'll see some movement now . And I think it 's an issue that deserves some attention , and they 're obviously going to give it some . And I think that Reverend Jackson being out there will highlight the issue . So I think it 's fine . Q Mr. President , how about the logjam in the Senate on the economic stimulus plan ? Do you think they 'll be able to break that and get cloture ? THE PRESIDENT : I do n't know , we 're working at it . I mean , it 's a classic -- there was an article in the paper today , one of the papers I saw , which pretty well summed it up . They said , you know , this is a -- it 's just a political power play . In the Senate the majority does not rule . It 's not like the country . It 's not like the -- it 's not like the House . If the minority chooses , they can stop majority rule . And that 's what they 're doing . There are a lot of Republican senators who have told people that they might vote for the stimulus program but there 's enormous partisan political pressure not to do it . And , of course , what it means is that in this time when no new jobs are being created , even though there seems to be an economic recovery , it means that for political purposes they 're willing to deny jobs to places like Baltimore and Dallas and Houston and Pittsburgh and Philadelphia and Portland and Seattle . It 's very sad . I mean , the block grant program was designed to create jobs in a hurry based on local priorities , and it 's one that the Republicans had always championed . Just about the only Democrat champions of the program were people like me who were out there at the grassroots level , governors and senators . I just think it 's real sad that they have chosen to exert the minority muscle in a way that will keep Americans out of work . I think it 's a mistake . THE PRESS : Thank you . END11:50 A.M. EDT

From this account , it does n't sound like you even saw the goal , Mike . Smith came out from behind his own net and fired a breakout pass that hit Fuhr in the back of the leg . Fuhr was backing up at the time and never saw what happened . The puck went straight off Fuhr 's leg and into the net . Fuhr never had a chance . There was no play back to the goaltender , in fact Perry Berezan of Calgary had just dumped it in and Smith was retrieving it . It was unfortunate that it happened ; Smith is a nice guy and was only a rookie at the time , and on his birthday too . But all the blame lies with him . Starting in pee-wee coaches tell players never to make a cross-ice pass in front of their own net . Too much chance of having it intercepted , or hitting the goaltender , or whatever . And to the people who say that Smith cost the Oilers the series , I can only say that he certainly did n't cause the team to lose the other three games . There was no reason for a powerhouse team like Edmonton to be tied late in the third period of the 7th game of the second round . Everybody on the team has to take responsibility for them even being in that situation . Alan

The goalie who gets back his all-star form ( Roy or Hextall ) can win the series for his team . Eposode Summary -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - This episode took place rinkside . Don was holding a hot dog that he bought from the concession stand . Ron Maclean started out by showing a cartoon which appeared in the Toronto Sun . It featured a picture of Don , who just saw his shadow and proclaimed `` Will you look at dat , eh ? Means another 6 weeks of me . Beauty . '' Next , Don talked about the hot dog he was holding . According to him , the hot dogs at the Quebec stadium are the best food in all the arenas in the NHL . From there , Don commented on the Quebec-Montreal game . The game had great flow , because Referee Paul Stewart calls the best game in the NHL . In contrast , the Calgary-LA game was terrible ... All stop-and-go , over 50 minutes of penalties called against Calgary by Dan Marouelli . Its getting so that the ref who calls the most penalties gets to ref in the finals . Next , Ron showed an old picture of Don , when he was playing for the Rochester Americans of the AHL . Don recalled some of the wins that he had in the Quebec arena ... during the Memorial cup and the AHL championships . Finally , Don and Ron discussed Keenan becoming coach of the Rangers . The rangers were a talented team who underachieved . Don feels sorry for temporary coach Ron Smith , who had several key injuries ( to Leetch and Patrick ) and goalies who went cold . Don had some criticism for the Rangers team ... The party 's over , Adolf ( Keenan ) is there . The Rangers organization will no longer be a 'country club ' ... . `` NY should be achamed of themselves ... If they go in the tank with Adolf there , they 'll be hanging from the yardarm by their thumbs . '' Rating -- -- -- Nothing too special in this episode .

Such a measure would also have another benefit . It would relieve the various states of the thorny problem of what to do with the hundreds of millions of dollars hunters pour into the economy annually . I'm sure that , to attain sure a lofty , humane , liberal and ecologically ( not to mention politically ) correct goal , the environmental and animal rights groups/individuals supporting such a measure would be more than willing to add their names to a list of supporters seeking increased taxation to replace these lost revenues . I am equally confident that these same entities , given their noteworthy record in the area of social responsibility and respect for private property , would feel morally and ethically bound to raise the necessary funds to acquire the hundreds of thousands of acres of land now held in private hands solely for use as private hunting preserves by the landowner ( s ) . To do less than this would place these same groups/individuals in the ethically untenable ( to say nothing of environmentally and politically incorrect ) position of sanctioning the logging and subsequent development and urbanization of these former private hunting lands , which would no longer be useable by , or of any benefit to , the landowner ( s ) in such a capacity .

You > do n't need six feet of lead to make decent shielding ; your dead skin > cell layer does an excellent job on alpha particles , and neutrons > are slowed by mere *water* . What do you think 75 % of you is ? But whatever the neutrons hit has a good chance of absorbing the neutron and becoming radioactive itself . Mostly , that means water turning into ( harmless ) heavy water . But some neutrons would also hit bones , and the resulting harmfull , secondard radioactives would remain in the body for decades . I think an unshielded nuclear warhead could reasonably be considered a public health hazard . As for a shielded warhead , I think a fair amount of maintaince is required for it to remain safely shielded ( e.g . storage in a dry , temperature-regulated facility , etc ... ) For private ownership to be unregulated , I think a single individual must be able not only to keep the weapon , but keep it in a safe condition . If any random private citizen could not properly keep , maintain and store a nuclear weapon , then some regulation is clearly appropriate . > > Plus these things have no self- > > defense purposes . It 's kinda hard to justify their use as > > a militia weapon when at best they are meant for battlefield use > > ( low-yield weapons ) or at worst for industrial target obliteration > > ( translation : cities and population centers ) . > If the militia has as its job the overthrow of an illegal > government , they are indeed useful weapons to the militia . I disagree with this purpose : The job of the militia is to defend themselves and their community . If you look at the American revolution as an example , the militias won by seperating themselves from , and becoming independent of , a repressive government . They did n't overthrow it , and those communities ( Canada and England , for example ) that did n't defend themselves were still under that same old regime . If the role of the militia were offensive , to go out and destroy repressive governments , nuclear weapons _might_ be appropriate . But their jobs is defensive , and nuclear weapons are n't suited for that . There is also the question of personal and collective arms : The Second Amendment definately protects ownership of personal weapons ( since the very nature of the militia requires members to provide their own arms . ) But it is n't clear if it covers other arms . Certainly , not all members would supply ( for example ) a tank , only a few could or ( if they were to be used effectively ) should . However , those providing the heavy weapons have a disproportionate control over the militia and its fierpower . The militias , as the framers envisioned them , were extremely democratic : If only 50 % of the members supported the cause , only 50 % would respond to a muster , and the militia 's firepower would be proportionately reduced . Militia firepower and the popular will were , therefore , linked . But if a small minority of the members supplied a large fraction of the firepower ( in the form of heavy weapons ) this would all change : The militia's firepower would depend on the will of a small minority , not of the general public . Worse , that minority would be quite different from the general public ( at the very least , they would be much richer . ) As a result , I think the nature and character of the militia requires that each member provide a roughly equal share of the militia 's firepower : His personal weapons , and some equitable fraction of a squad 's heavier firepower .

Actions : prove our faith and show the genuineness of it . A good example of this is Abraham ( referred to in the James passage ) . Hebrews says that Abraham was justified by faith -- but his faith was demonstrated through his works ( i.e. , he obeyed what God told him to do ) . Reading Abraham 's `` biography '' in Genesis is very instructive . He was a man beset by *lack* of faith a lot of the time ( e.g . lying about Sarah being his wife on 2 occasions ; trying to fulfil God 's promise on God 's behalf by copulating with Hagar ) . . . yet it seems that God did n't evaluate him on the basis of individual incidents . Abraham is listed as one of the `` heroes of faith '' in Hebrews 11 . i.e. , when it really came to the crunch , God declared Abraham as a man of faith . He believed God 's promises . This gives us confidence . Although real faith demonstrates itself through works , God is not going to judge us according to our success/failure in performing works . `` Not by works of righteousness which we have done , but according to His mercy he saved us , through the washing of regeneration , and renewing of the Holy Spirit .

Ryan > Another good place for your helmet is your mirror ( ! ) . I kid you not . This is very bad advice . Helmets have two major impact absorbing layers ... a hard outer shell and a closed-cell foam impact layer . Most helmets lose their protective properties because the inner liner compacts over time , long before the outer shell is damaged or delaminates from age . Dr. Hurt tested helmets for many years following his landmark study and has estimated that a helmet can lose up to 80 % of it 's effectiveness from inner liner compression . I have a video he produced that discusses this phenomenon in detail . Puncture compression of the type caused by mirrors , sissy bars , and other relatively sharp objects is the worst offender . Even when the comfort liner is unaffected , dents and holes in the foam can seriously degrade the effectiveness of a helmet . If you are in the habit of '' parking your lid '' on the mirrors , I suggest you look under the comfort liner at the condition of the foam . If it is significantly damaged ( or missing : - ) , replace the helmet . -- Jerry Lotto < lotto @ lhasa.harvard.edu > MSFCI , HOGSSC , BCSO , AMA , DoD # 18 Chemistry Dept. , Harvard Univ . `` It 's my Harley , and I 'll ride if I want to ...

We wanted to talk to the internet with the mail package so we got the smtp gateway . You also need a tcp/ip transport package on top of that which is utterly stupid but that 's what they require to get the smtp gateway to work . You need a dedicated pc for the gateway and if you are looking at remote access you need another dedicated pc for the remote mail stuff . We do not have the remote mail going but you indicate that that is what you want to do . There is a glitch somewhere in the system though . I do n't know if it is MS mail , the gateway or the VAX here on campus that is choking in the mail that is sent . The scenario is this . The outgoing mail goes to a Unix system which then routes the mail where it needs to go . If that mail is routed to the VAX , the VAX has problems some times receiving the mail . Most messages do get through this way except if someone has there mail on the VAX forwarded to some other location . That is the main gotcha . Where ever the mail is forwarded to that person gets a message header then a message saying `` Boudary : = ( error garbage code stuff ) '' . If you can stay away from sending to a VAX you are ok . The system people of course say that the VAX is not the problem , the gateway is probably the problem . If anyone wants to get help it is only $ 175.00 for one support call .

If the latter , I sure hope it 's one of those Cheeto and string models that all the computer mags have been raving about : - ) The point is , _I_ am not stupid because of _your_ incorrect assumption . I'd only be stupid if I insulted you for having made it . But , alas , that 's your job , Fred . And , finally , your style is confusing , since you tried to make two points , simultaneously , with an allegory/insult . Sadly , one point addressed a 'plan' that only existed in your mind , and the other took issue with behaviors that you do as much as anyone . > More deliberate lack of understanding , Tommy ? No , no , I finally got it . You do n't like the plan that Nick 's posts made you imagine . And you do n't like Nick 's obnoxious behavior , even though it 's no worse than your own .

Or is this just the pique of a > net.ghod wannabe who got turned down by someone he *thought* was new > ( and hence could be 'instructed ' -- Tommy , I saw you come on the net ) . Who cares who came on the net first ? If you do , consider that you saw me come on after a brief haitus , before which I was on for about 2 years . If you had seen me on the net first , you 'd remember when Nick and I went down exactly the same road regarding rude , unneccesary behavior . It's just amazing to me that you continue to take issue with behavior that's no worse than your own . Let 's see here , my complaints about your obnoxious behavior are hypocritical , while your flames against people you decide are flamers is n't , and my complaints about your name-calling are immature , while your name-calling is n't . Yeah , right . Maybe if you called me some more names , I might see it better , Fred . `` Net.ghod wannabe '' ? Naturally , Fred , you 've correctly interpreted my motivations , when yours are impossible to judge from your actions ( as your insulting of people that try , proves ) . I did n't really care about people that fill the net with personal garbage , what I really wanted was to impress everyone . I only put my complaints with your behavior on private mail , not because it belongs there , but because I thought you were such a jerk that you 'd bring it back to the Net , playing right into my hands . Alas , I had no idea what an intellectual master you were , turning tables and bringing the history of these posts to the net , for the noble and valuable purpose of embarassing me . Whether I should feel stupid because I tried to make suggestions to such a superior intellect , or becuase I tried to communicate like an adult with a self-righteous ass , still is n't clear . Well , Fred , you exposed me . Now I 'll never be able to get a ( nother ) job with NASA , since they all know that I 'm stupider than Fred McCall . Well , I just hope you 're happy . Please leave me alone , now . I just don't have the heart to attempt keeping up with one so far above me . Maybe Nick or Pat can approach your high standards , but I 'm dropping it now . -Tommy Mac -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Tom McWilliams 517-355-2178 wk \\ As the radius of vision increases , 18084tm @ ibm.cl.msu.edu 336-9591 hm \\ the circumference of mystery grows . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -

What harm is there in overreacting ? This may be the largest single threat to civil liberties yet in my lifetime . The US has done some pretty heinous things in the past , and we have n't yet recovered from all of them . There certainly seems to be a historical trend towards less liberty , with occasional perturbations . Time to break out the quotes from American political radicals .

I already identified the power supply on pins 3 ( 5V ) and 6 ( 12V ) , shorted pin 6 ( 5.25 '' /3.5 '' switch ) and inserted pullup resistors ( 2K2 ) on pins 8 , 26 , 28 , 30 , and 34 .

Put two riders on identical machines . It 's the one who knows what he 's doing , and why , that will be faster . It *may* be possible to improve your technique if you have no idea what it is , through trial and error , but it is not very effective methodology . Only by understanding the technique of steering a motorcycle can one improve on that technique ( I hold that this applies to any human endeavor ) . > that 's all it is - an interesting bit of knowledge , and to claim that > it is essential for all bikers to know it , or that you can corner faster > or better as a result , is absurd . Do you consider an understanding of the physics of traction absurd ? Are you seriously suggesting that one can form a traction management policy without understanding what it is or what factors increase or decrease available traction ? Braking ? It is highly unlikely that any biker is going to develop his maximum swerving ability without any knowledge of turning techniques . For most of his riding life this may not be a problem , but in an emergency situation it is very definately placing him at a disadvantage . > But by including countersteering > theory in newbie courses we are confusing people unnecessarily , right at > the time when there are *far* more important matters for them to learn . I disagree . The existance and immense success of riding courses which teach the technique indicate that the concept can be taught in a manner that is neither confusing , nor detracts from any other aspects of the course . > And that was my original point . Perhaps , but in the ensuing discussion , you strayed far from that point , to claim that knowledge of steering technique is irrelevant to a rider 's ability .

This is a lovely area for anecdotes , but I am sure you are on to something . As a physician , I almost never get sick : usually , when something horrendous is going around , I either do n't get it at all or get a very mild case . When I do get really sick , it is always something unusual . This was not the situation when I was in medical school , particularly on pediatrics . I never had younger siblings myself , and when I went on the pediatric wards I suddenly found myself confronting all sorts of infectious challenges that my body was not ready for . Pediatrics for me was three solid months of illness , and I had a temp of 104 when I took the final exam ! I think what happens is that during training , and beyond , we are constantly exposed to new things , and we have the usual reactions to them , so that later on , when challenged with something , it is more likely a re-exposure for us , so we deal with it well and get a mild illness . I do n't think it is that the immune system is hyped up in any way . Also , do n't forget that the hospital flora is very different from the home , and we carry a lot of that around . -km

A question for you - can you give me the name of an organization or a philosophy or a political movement , etc. , which has never had anything evil done in its name ? You 're missing a central teaching of Christianity - man is inherently sinful . We are saved through faith by grace . Knowing that , believing that , does not make us without sin . Furthermore , not all who consider themselves `` christians '' are ( even those who manage to head their own `` churches '' ) . `` Not everyone who says to me , 'Lord , Lord , ' will enter the kingdom of heaven , but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven . '' - Matt . 7:21 . > I also have a problem with the inconsistancies in the Bible , and > how it seems to me that too many people have edited the original > documents to fit their own world views , thereby leaving the Bible > an unbelievable source .

Well , it 's really a shame you feel this way . No one can browbeat you into believing , and those who try will probably only succeed in driving you further away . You need to ask yourself some difficult questions : 1 ) is there an afterlife , and if so , does man require salvation to attain it . If the answer is yes , the next question is 2 ) how does man attain this salvation - can he do it on his own as the eastern religions and certain modern offshoots like the `` new age movement '' teach or does he require God's help ? 3 ) If the latter , in what form does - indeed , in what form can such help come ? Needless to say , this discussion could take a lifetime , and for some people it did comprise their life 's writings , so I am hardly in a position to offer the answers here - merely pointers to what to ask . Few , of us manage to have an unshaken faith our entire lives ( certainly not me ) . The spritual life is a difficult journey ( if you 've never read `` A Pilgrim's Progress , '' I highly recommend this greatest allegory of the english language ) . > Peace and Love > In God ( ess ) 's name > James Moss Now I see by your close that one possible source of trouble for you may be a conflict between your politcal beliefs and your religious upbringing . You wrote that `` I ( in my own faith ) accept and live my life by many if not most of the teachings of christ '' . Well , Christ referred to God as `` My Father '' , not `` My Mother '' , and while the `` maleness '' of God is not the same as the maleness of those of us humans who possess a Y chromosome , it does not honor God to refer to Him as female purely to be trendy , non-discriminatory , or politically correct . This in no way disparages women ( nor is it my intent to do so by my use of the male pronoun to refer to both men and women - english just does not have a decent neuter set of pronouns ) . After all , God chose a woman as his only human partner in bringing Christ into the human population . Well , I 'm not about to launch into a detailed discussion of the role of women in Christianity at 1am with only 6 hours of sleep in the last 63 , and for that reason I also apologize for any shortcomings in this article . I just happened across yours and felt moved to reply . I hope I may have given you , and anyone else who finds himself in a similar frame of mind , something to contemplate . Karl Dussik

Maddison and Hamilton were both studying existing forms of government for several years before they wrote the federalist papers . That the US system is based to a considerable degree on the UK model is pretty widely accepted . At the time there was no other major country with a representative body . The French plebicite had been suppressed for 140 years and its restoration eight years later would mark the start of the French revolution . After the UK system the major influences were the Dutch system and of course the classical systems . Nobody seriously suggests that Rome or Greece were models though because the political systems of both countries were acknowleged disasters . The main lesson learnt from Greece was that unless a federal state was constructed a war would be inevitable . The Greek democracies were always fighting amongst themselves which is how Rome managed to invade . Had the federal consitution been rejected the new Roman empire in the shape of Britain would quite certainly have reabsorbed much of the colonies in due course . Moreover the states would have been at each others throats as soon as the Louisiana purchase situation arose during the Napoleonic period . Phill Hallam-Baker

Personally , I think it 's your Duty As a Citizen to make it as much trouble as possible for them , so maybe they 'll Give Up and Leave Us Alone Someday Soon . The cop was certainly within his legal rights to nail you by guessing your speed . Mr. Brown ( the author of Fight Your Ticket ) mentions an Oakland judge who convicted a speeder `` on the officer 's testimony that the driver 's car sounded like it was being driven at an excessive speed . '' You can pay off the State and your insurance company , or you can take it to court and be creative . Personally , I 've never won that way or seen anyone win , but the judge always listens politely . And I haven't seen _that_ many attempts . You could try the argument that since bikes are shorter than the cars whose speed the nice officer is accustomed to guessing , they therefore appear to be further away , and so their speed appears to be greater than it actually is . I left out a step or two , but you get the idea . If you can make it convincing , theoretically you 're supposed to win . I 've never tried proving the cop was mistaken . I did get to see some other poor biker try it . He was mixing up various facts like the maximum acceleration of a ( cop ) car , and the distance at which the cop had been pacing him , and end up demonstrating that he couldn't possibly have been going as fast as the cop had suggested . He'd brought diagrams and a calculator . He was Prepared . He lost . Keep in mind cops do this all the time , and their word is better than yours . Maybe , though , they do n't guess how fast bikes are going all the time . Besides , this guy did n't speak English very well , and ended up absolutely confounding the judge , the cop , and everyone else in the room who 'd been recently criminalized by some twit with a gun and a quota . Ahem . OK , I 'm better now . Maybe he 'd have won had his presentation been more polished . Maybe not . He did get applause .

In expanded muxed mode , you *could* do it . Much easier if you get a DRAM controller IC . The MMI 673102 could be used to implement this , or you could use a counter and a huge multiplexer to provide row/column/refresh address multiplexing . The thing with DRAMs is that they require wierd timing , address multiplexing , and refresh . Actually , if you wanted to use a 68008 IC , you could look at AN897 , which has a neat controller built in . There is also the 683xx , I think one of those has the DRAM controller built in . This one is for the 6664 DRAM , however , the 41256 has only one more address line , adding only another component or so . The 256k SIMMs are basically 8 or 9 41256 DRAM chips ( or their equivalent in fewer packages ) . It *can* be done , just takes a bit of logic design . I 'm actually about to do it using a 65C02P3 chip ... I 've got 8 256k simms ... that's 2 megabytes on my Apple //e ... ( used to be in my '386 ) .

You might start with Mack 's book on Q and then examine the others afterward . However I think that once you do that you will see that your `` evidence '' is not as sturdy as you 'd like .

One of these days you 'll learn that the way to stop Israel from fighting back is to stop attacking . If there were no attacks in the security zone for a year because the Lebanese army could maintain the peace , then Lebanon would be in much better shape . Tell me something , though . Why do Syrian troops not get attacked ? Are n't they occupying Lebanon ? Israel has repeatedly stated that it will leave on two conditions .

Science has its basis in observable fact . I 'd say that what one chooses to observe and how the observation is interpreted and what significance it 's given depends a great deal on the values of the observer . Science is a human activity and as such , is subject to the same potential for distortion as any other human activity . The myth that scientists are above moral influence or ethical concern , that their knowledge can be abstacted whole and pure from nature untainted by the biases of the scientist , is nonsense . Bill : If one is to argue for objective values ( in a moral sense ) then one must : first start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective . Considering : the meaning of the word `` objective '' I doubt that this will ever happen . : So , back to the original question : : And objective morality is ... .. ? This may be an unfortunate choice of words , almost self-contradictory . Objective in the sense used here means something immutable and absolute while morality describes the behavior of some group of people . The first term is all inclusive , the second is specific . The concept supposedly described may have meaning however . If there is a God as described by the Christians ( for instance ) , then He has existence apart from and independent of humankind ; His existence is outside of our frame of reference ( reality ) . If this being declares a thing to be so , it is -necessarily- so since He has defined Himself as omnipotent and , if His claims are to be believed , He is at least omnipotent relative to us . God is intrinsically self-defined and all reality is whatever He says it is - in an objective sense . If God determines a standard of conduct , that standard is objective . If human beings are held accountable for their conformance to that standard while permitted to ignore it , they substitute a relative morality or mode of conduct , giving the term morality a nebulous , meaningless sense that can be argued about by those pretending to misunderstand . The standard is objective and the conduct required to meet that standard is therefore objectively determined . Just because it is convenient to pretend that the term morality is infinitely malleable , does n't mean that the objective standard itself does n't exist . Morality has come to mean little more than a cultural norm , or the preferred conduct of `` decent '' people , making it seem subjective , but it is derived from an absolute , objective , standard . Ironically , this objective standard is in perfect accord with our true nature ( according to Christianity at least ) , yet is condemned as being contrary to human nre , oppressive and severe . This may be due as Bill much to our amoral inclinations as to the standard itself , but like it or not , it 's there.x

From : usenet @ news.cso.uiuc.edu ( Net Noise owner ) Subject : Re : Facinating facts : 30 bit serial number , possibly fixed S1 and S2 Organization : University of Illinois @ Urbana/Champaign Lines : 32 The only way to view this method of generating unit keys is as a back-door . What else can you call a key deterministically generated from the serial number ? To generate the unit key for a serial number N , the 30-bit value N is first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1 . S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1 , producing a 64-bit block R1 : R1 = E [ D [ E [ N1 ; S1 ] ; S2 ] ; S1 ] . Similarly , N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and N3 , and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed : R2 = E [ D [ E [ N2 ; S1 ] ; S2 ] ; S1 ] R3 = E [ D [ E [ N3 ; S1 ] ; S2 ] ; S1 ] . R1 , R2 , and R3 are then concatenated together , giving 192 bits . The first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2 . The rest are discarded . The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2 . U1 and U2 are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow agencies . What happens is that the need for the Escrow houses is completely eliminated . Or should I say , the need to _access_ the Escrow houses to decrypt the data . The houses will still serve a real purpose as far as generating the illusion of protection , and small-town cops wo n't be let in on the `` secret '' , so they will still go through the motions of going to the Escrow houses , but the fact is __the Federal government CAN and WILL build a chip which generates the unit keys from the encrypted serial number ! __ 'Nuff Said .

My X process is started by xdm . i ) I want to setup the backgroud ( root window ? ) of the tvtwm display to display the escherknot etc ( grey is a very boring colour to work on ) ! The setup is as follows : lib/X11/xdm/Xsetup_0 - xsetroot -bitmap ... etc ~user/.xsession - xsetroot ... . etc tvtwm There are also .tvtwmrc and .Xdefaults files in the ( ~user ) home directory . The xsetroot in Xsetup_0 displays the appropriate bitmap in the xdm login window as expected - very nice ! Unfortunately , when the users session is started , the background of the tvtwm window reverts to grey . If I manually type xsetroot ... in an xterm window when the session has started , the background is changed as expected . The question is : How do I retain the background from the login window and/or specify a new background on a per-user basis as part of the the users session startup ? ii ) When I open an Xterm on the Sparc 10 , not all of the keys are recognised and some keys on the keyboard are not sending the correct characters . ie : real key key shown on screen -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - hash back slash tilde pipe double quote at symbol pound hash cursor key not recognised This is very annoying !

I 've run into two problems ; I 'm sure that other readers have tried this before , and have perhaps formulated their own opinions : 1 ) The routines for drawing walls 1 & 2 were trivial , but when I ran a packed- > planar image through them , I was dismayed by the `` jaggies . '' I'm now considered some anti-aliasing routines ( speed is not really necessary ) . Is it worth the effort to have the artist draw the wall already skewed , thus being assured of nice image , or is this too much of a burden ? 2 ) Wall 3 presents a problem ; the algorithm I used tends to overly distort the original . I tried to decide on paper what pixels go where , and failed . Has anyone come up with method for mapping a planar to crosswise sheared shape ? Currently I take : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 and produce : 1 2 3 4 33 34 35 36 17 18 19 20 5 6 7 8 49 50 51 52 37 38 39 40 21 22 23 24 9 10 11 12 53 54 55 56 41 42 43 44 25 26 27 28 13 14 15 16 57 58 59 60 45 46 47 48 29 30 31 32 61 62 63 64 Line 1 follows the slope . Line 2 is directly under line 1 . Line 3 moves up a line and left 4 pixels . Line 4 is under line 3 . This fills the shape exactly without any unfilled pixels . But it causes distortions . Has anyone come up with a better way ? Perhaps it is necessary to simply draw the original bitmap already skewed ? Are there any other particularly sticky problems with this perspective ? I was planning on having hidden plane removal by using z-buffering . Locations are stored in ( x , y , z ) form . [ * ] For those of you who noticed , the top lines of wall 2 ( and wall 1 ) *are* parallel with its bottom lines . This is why there appears to be an optical illusion ( ie . it appears to be either the inside or outside of a cube , depending on your mood ) . There are no vanishing points . This simplifies the drawing code for objects ( which do n't have to change size as they move about in the room ) . I 've decided that this approximation is alright , since small displacements at a large enough distance cause very little change in the apparent size of an object in a real perspective drawing . Hopefully the `` context '' of the picture ( ie . chairs on the floor , torches hanging on the walls ) will dispell any visual ambiguity .

That 's because , among other things , they 've given their > government power to bargain with doctors and hospitals over fees . The difference in the litigation environment is reflected in the fees . Lack of defensive medicine and near-absence of malpractice is really why we spend less using the most expensive approach of pure insurance in Canada ( along with France and Germany ) without HMO 's -- - the NYT has admitted that malpractice insurance fees are an order of magnitude lower in Canada but doctors take-home pay is almost equal to American doctors ; also , minimal bureaucracy 'cos the system is so-o-o simple ( early March ) . Part of the deal for using the all-insurance approach like the French and Germans do ( hey , why do n't they criticize France and Germany ? Is it because too many people take French and German in college to make the accusations stick ? ( - ; ) was to preserve the doctors independance . Since the provincial wings of the CMA are the ones that go to bat when the fee schedule hikes are presented , the politically-bent doctors were just cackling when they realized the CMA would grow in strength rather than diminish , especially when unopposed unlike in socialized medicine approaches like Britain 's National Health Service . > '' ` You 've got to remember , you 've got a waiting list as well , but it 's > not as obvious .

' '' For non-life threatening things , market arguments adequately cover why certain procedures are in scarcer demand . I have MD friends who can't make a living as specialists back in Manitoba not due to the insurance rates but because they wo n't get enough customers -- the CMA medical monopoly 's grip on doctors licencing ( as in the US ) aside -- so they must move to larger places . However , this does not refute debunking of waiting lines for urgent AND routine care , as has been done in the U.S. by Consumers Reports , health policy studies cited by Prof. Dennis E. Shea on USENET , CNN , NYT , etc . Doug Fierro has posted a NYT article from 3 weeks ago about Canada's health insurance approach , on Talk.politics.medicine . There is one small error in the article : not all of our hospitals are private . > WOULD N'T NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE MEAN THAT AMERICANS WHO ARE NOW > FULLY INSURED MIGHT HAVE TO SETTLE FOR LESS ? > > In Canada , provincial insurance covers all health costs except dental > care , eyeglasses , prescription drugs , ambulance service , and private > hospital rooms , -- so many Canadians do end up buying some private > insurance . A policy to cover all of these things runs about # 40 to $ 40 > a month . Of course , the one thing to note is that in the Canada/France/Germany case , private insurance *offloaded* the basic coverage to the public sector . They realized they were keeping low-risk/high-profit extra insurance for things like private/semi-private rooms ( vs. ward accomodation ) , dental , glasses , etc . for corporate or personal benefits , they 'll have nothing to do with you if you want to be covered for basic care . At that point , they would n't even consider a `` voucher '' approach to broker the universal coverage and sell policies to make up the difference in the federal guidelines and market stuff . > ****************************************************************** > > WOULD N'T FREE CARE ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO RUN TO THE DOCTOR FOR EVERY > ACHE AND PAIN ? > > People who get free treatment *do* go to the doctor and hospital about > a third more often than those who have to pay a share of their medical > bills . > > Still , Canadians -- who pay nothing at the doctor 's -- have a lower > per-person health bill than we do . It is `` free '' in that there are no deductibles nor copayments ( two things which I advocate to make the Canadian insurance look more like real health insurance -- which actually it is ) . I know that when working in Alberta , Ontario and Quebec , I was aware that I was paying for health insurance - e.g. , in Toronto , OHIP fees were listed on my pay stub ; Manitoba did not collect at paycheque time , but only annually at income tax time ( built into the tax rate ) . Only fiscal naifs will proclaim that it 's free , along with the Canadian Left for that is part of their brainwashing agenda . The French do have copayments , though . France Magazine 's Summer 1992 edition has a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance coverage , including a sample chart of copayment percentages . For 1-30 days , you 're covered for 80 % of the public hospital rate , 100 % afterward . With extra private insurance , you can get into a private hospital and be covered for any differences beyond the public hospital rate . The public insurance covers 100 % beyond 30 days , or the same cash amount for a private hospital and the difference is paid out-of-pocket or according to your supplementary private insurance . Over 2/3rds of French have some form of extra private insurance . So , the other 30 % of health costs in Europe are out of private funds , not gleaned from other taxes . The GDP figures are combined public and private expenditures for total outlay using the same methods that yield the 13-14 % figure for the U.S. > IS N'T THE PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INDUSTRY JUST TOO BIG > AND POWERFUL TO KILL ? > > Dismantling the health segment of our insurance industry would be > '' politically thorny , '' in the quiet words of one advocate for a > national plan .

Not only has the industry > grown eightfold since Canada shut down its own health insurers , but > our government leaves politicians more open to lobbyists than does > Canada 's parliamentary system . Health insurance does exist in Canada and in Western Europe , its just that it does n't cover basic care . You can opt out in Canada and Germany , but you 'll have to go uninsured as a result because there are too few other people that do so -- - i.e. , no market . When private insurance realized how much money they 'd make without the risks involved in basic insurance ( e.g. , neurosurgery ) versus deluxe amenities ( e.g. , having to call Granada TV to replace a rental set on the fritz in someone 's private hospital room ) , they started to pat themselves on the back for their social responsibility . In Quebec last spring , a consortium of private insurers publicly warned against any thoughts of privatizing routine , low cost parts of that province's public health insurance plan . gld -- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Je me souviens ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Gary L.

From : rauser @ fraser.sfu.ca ( Richard John Rauser ) Subject : Too Many Europeans in NHL Organization : Simon Fraser University , Burnaby , B.C. , Canada Lines : 50 Ten years ago , the number of Europeans in the NHL was roughly a quarter of what it is now . Going into the 1992/93 season , the numbers of Euros on NHL teams have escalated to the following stats : Canadians : 400 Americans : 100 Europeans : 100 Please note that these numbers are rounded off , and taken from the top 25 players on each of the 24 teams . My source is the Vancouver Sun . Here 's the point : there are far too many Europeans in the NHL . I am sick of watching a game between an American and a Canadian team ( let 's say , the Red Wings and the Canucks ) and seeing names like `` Bure '' `` Konstantinov '' and '' Borshevshky '' . Is this North America or is n't it ? Toronto , Detriot , Quebec , and Edmonton are particularly annoying , but the numbers of Euros on other teams is getting worse as well . I live in Vancouver and if I hear one more word about `` Pavel Bure , the Russian Rocket '' I will completely throw up . As it is now , every time I see the Canucks play I keep hoping someone will cross-check Bure into the plexiglassso hard they have to carry him out on a stretcher . ( By the way , I 'm not a Canucks fan to begin with ; - ) . Okay , the stretcher remark was a little carried away . But the point is that I resent NHL owners drafting all these Europeans INSTEAD of Canadians ( and some Americans ) . It denies young Canadians the opportunity to play in THEIR NORTH AMERICAN LEAGUE and instead gives it to Europeans , who are n't even better hockey players . It 's all hype . This `` European mystique '' is sickening , but until NHL owners get over it , Canadian and American players will continue to have to fight harder to get drafted into their own league . With the numbers of Euros in the NHL escalating , the problem is clearly only getting worse . I 'm all for the creation of a European Hockey League , and let the Bures and Selannes of the world play on their own continent . I just do n't want them on mine . -- Richard J.

Standard colormaps were spec 'd with the intention that window managers would make them available .

Since standard colormaps typically devour all 256 entries , there is no way it can avoid displacing the entire default colormap if your hardware has only one CLUT . I do n't believe standard colormaps are intended to aboid possible colormap flashing between clients using the default coilormap . Rather , colormap flashing will be avoided between two clients that use the same standard colormap . An example would be two clients that need a full color range would both use XA_RGB_BEST_MAP ( or whatever it's called under X11R5 ) . If you are trying to avoid colormap flashing with the default colormap , your best bet is to try to load all the colors you use into that colormap . If you ca n't do that , then you 'll get flashing on a one hw CLUT framebuffer . Now if your window manager used the same standard colormap as your client , this flashing could also be avoided . Perhaps some window managers have command line options for selecting standard colormaps ? -- -paul pmartz @ dsd.es.com Evans & Sutherland

From : steph @ pegasus.cs.uiuc.edu ( Dale Stephenson ) Subject : Hits Stolen -- Second Base 1992 Summary : Stolen Hits for all second basemen Keywords : second defense Organization : University of Illinois , Dept . of Comp . Sci. , Urbana , IL Lines : 117 Disclaimer -- This is for fun . In my computerized baseball game , I keep track of a category called '' stolen hits '' , defined as a play made that `` an average fielder would not make with average effort . '' Using the 1992 Defensive Averages posted by Sherri Nichols ( Thanks Sherri ! ) , I 've figured out some defensive stats for the second basemen . Hits Stolen have been redefined as `` Plays Kurt Stillwell would not have made . '' OK , I realize that 's unfair . Kurt 's probably the victim of pitching staff , fluke shots , and a monster park factor . But let 's put it this way : If we replaced every second baseman in the NL with someone with Kurt 's 57.6 % out making ability , how many extra hits would go by ? To try and correlate it to reality a little more , I 've calculated Net Hits Stolen , based on the number of outs made compared to what a league average fielder would make . By the same method I 've calculated Net Double Plays , and Net Extra Bases ( doubles and triples let by ) . Finally , I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution , or DCON : - > . Basically , it represents the defensive contribution of a player . I add this number to OPS to get DOPS ( Defense + Onbase Plus Slug ) , which should represent the player 's total contribution to the team . So don't take it too seriously . The formula for DCON appears at the end of this article . The short version -- definition of terms HS -- Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to Kurt Stillwell NHS -- Net Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to average fielder NDP -- Net Double Plays -- Extra double plays turned compared to avg fielder NEB -- Net Extra Bases -- Extra bases prevented compared to avg . fielder DCON -- Defensive Contribution -- bases and hits prevented , as a rate .

The extra outs are factored into OBP , while the extra bases removed are factored into SLG . That 's why I used PA and AB as the divisors .

Can do simple display , enhancing , smoothing and so on . Works with the FITS and VICAR/PDS data formats of NASA . Can read TIFF images , if you know their dimensions [ PC and Macs ] LabVIEW 2 -- -- -- -- - LabVIEW is used as a framework for image processing tools . It provides a graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the `` program '' with graphical elements representing the programming elements . Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a wiring tool to create the block diagram ( program ) . Functions that the block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and filtering , numerical analysis , statistics , etc . The tool allows any Virtual Instrument ( VI , a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory instrument ) to be used as a part of any other virtual instrument . National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing ( DSP ) boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time acquisition and analysis at a personal computer . New software tools for DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology . The tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block diagram development software . There are three levels of DSP programming associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW : Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library : FFTs , power spectra , filters routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop ( MPW ) C that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board . There is an analysis Virtual Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300 . Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an optimizing C compiler , an assembler and a linker for low-level programming of the DSP hardware . This approach offers the highest level of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use . Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has utility functions for memory management data communications and downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board . ( This is the easiest route for the development of custom code . ) Ultimage Concept VI -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Concept VI by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual Instruments ( VIs ) that give LabVIEW 2 ( described above ) users high-end tools for designing , integrating and monitoring imaging control systems . A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory instrument . Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography , surveillance , machine vision , production testing , biomedical imaging , electronic microscopy and remote sensing . Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further qualitative and quantitative analysis . It includes a complete set of functions for image enhancement , histogram equalization , spatial and frequency filtering , isolation of features , thresholding , mathematical morphology analysis , density measurement , object counting , sizing and characterization . The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64 , a pixel depth of 8 , 16 , or 32 bits , and one image plane . Standard input and output formats include PICT , TIFF , SATIE , and AIPD . Other formats can be imported . Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations , spatial linear and non-linear filters , frequency filtering , arithmetic and logic operations , and geometric transformations , among others . Morphological transformations include erosion , dilation , opening , closing , hole removal , object separation , and extraction of skeletons , among others . Quantitative analysis provides for objects ' detection , measurement , and morphological distribution . Measures include area , perimeter , center of gravity , moment of inertia , orientation , length of relevant chords , and shape factors and equivalence . Measures are saved in ASCII format . The program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom modules . A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot . The histogram tool can be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale . The twenty-eight arithmetic and logical operations provide for : masking and averaging sections of images , noise removal , making comparisons , etc . There are 13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local intensity . These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines . The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as either the ( real , imaginary ) components or the ( phase , magnitude ) data . The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening and defining objects or for removing artifacts . The transformations include : thresholding , eroding , dilating and even hole filling . The program 's quantitative analysis measurements include : area , perimeter , center of mass , object counts , and angle between points .

MicroFrontier 7650 Hickman Road Des Moines , IA 50322 515-270-8109 Image Analyst -- -- -- -- -- -- - An image processing product for users who need to extract quantitative data from video images . Image Analyst lets users configure sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the necessity of knowing a programming language . It is designed for such tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video cameras attached to microscopes , or enhancing and measuring distances in radiographs . Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of instructions to enhance feature appearance ; count objects ; determine density , shape , size , position , or movement ; perform object feature extraction ; and conduct textural analysis automatically . Image Analyst works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera , or a disk-stored image . Within minutes , without the need for programming , the Image Analyst user can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image . Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images . Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size , shape and position . The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and Scion frame grabbers . A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices . There are 2 types of files , the image itself and the related Sequence file that holds the processing , measurements and analysis that the user defines . Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest ( ROI ) represented by movable , sizable boxes atop the image . Inside a ROI , the program can find the distance between two edges , the area of a shape , the thickness of a wall , etc . Image Analyst finds the center , edge and other positions automatically . The application also provides tools so that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object . It also supports histograms and a color look-up table ( CLUT ) tool .

Feature Description DISIMP incorporates a rich library of image processing utilities and spatial data options . All functions can be easily accessed via the DISIMP executive . This menu is modular in design and groups image processes by their function . Such a logical structure means that complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of modules . Processes include image rectification , classification ( unsupervised and supervised ) , intensity transformations , three dimensional display and Principal Component Analysis . DISIMP also supports the more simple and effective enhancement techniques of filtering , band subtraction and ratioing . Host Configuration Requirements Running on UNIX workstations , DISIMP is capable of processing the more computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times . DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer 's environments . Using the Programmers environment , utilities can be developed for specific applications programs . Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick enhancments of a displayed image . Manipulations of Look Up Tables , colour stretches , changes to histograms , zooming and panning can be interactively driven through this control . A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of image , graphic and textual types . Images can be rectified by a number of coordinate systems , providing the true geographic knowledge essential for ground truthing . Overlays of grids , text and vector data can be added to further enhance referenced imagery . The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels to determine their own working environment , including the amount of help required . DISIMP comes fully configured with no optional extras . The purchase price includes all functionality required for professional processing of remote sensed data .

Been around for a number of years , sold to Weather Service and Navy . Runs on HP9000 with HP-UX . Supports 24-bit display '' HIPS -- -- ( Human Information Processing Laboratory 's Image Processing System ) Michael Landy co-wrote and sell a general-purpose package for image processing which has been used for basically all the usual image processing applications ( robotics , medical , satellite , engineering , oil exploration , etc. ) . It is called HIPS , and deals with sequences of multiband images in the same way it deals with single images . It has been growing since we first wrote it , both by additions from us as well as a huge user-contributed library . Feature description HIPS is a set of image processing modules which together provide a powerful suite of tools for those interested in research , system development and teaching . It handles sequences of images ( movies ) in precisely the same manner as single frames . Programs and subroutines have been developed for simple image transformations , filtering , convolution , Fourier and other transform processing , edge detection and line drawing manipulation , digital image compression and transmission methods , noise generation , and image statistics computation . Over 150 such image transformation programs have been developed . As a result , almost any image processing task can be performed quickly and conveniently . Additionally , HIPS allows users to easily integrate their own custom routines . New users become effective using HIPS on their first day . HIPS features images that are self-documenting . Each image stored in the system contains a history of the transformations that have been applied to that image . HIPS includes a small set of subroutines which primarily deals with a standardized image sequence header , and a large library of image transformation tools in the form of UNIX `` filters '' . It comes complete with source code , on-line manual pages , and on-line documentation . Host Configuration Requirements Originally developed at New York University , HIPS now represents one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image processing environments currently available . It runs under the UNIX operating system . It is modular and flexible , provides automatic documentation of its actions , and is almost entirely independent of special equipment . HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and Microvax , Sun , Apollo , Masscomp , NCR Tower , Iris , IBM AT , etc . For image display and input , drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and Adage ( Ikonas ) image processors , and the Sun-2 , Sun-3 , Sun- 4 , and Sun-386i consoles . We also supply user-contributed drivers for a number of other framestores and windowing packages ( Sun gfx , Sun console , Matrox VIP-1024 , ITI IP-512 , Lexidata , Macintosh II , X windowing system , and Iris ) . The Hipsaddon package includes an interface for the CRS-4000 . It is a simple matter to interface HIPS with other frame- stores , and we can put interested users in touch with users who have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max- Video . HIPS can be easily adapted for other image display devices because 98 % of HIPS is machine independent . Availability HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible system , both as an interactive research tool , and for more production- oriented tasks . It is both easy to use , and quickly adapted and extended to new uses . HIPS is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format ( either reel- to-reel or Sun cartridge ) , and comes with source code , libraries , a library of convolu- tion masks , and on-line documentation and manual pages .

MIRA gives workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in 256 color modes up to 1024x768 . MIRA contains a very handsome/functional GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated . MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS formats , native formats of a number of CCD cameras , and uncompressed binary images in byte , short integer , and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2- dimensions . The result of an image processing operation can be short integer or real pixels , or the same as that of the input image . MIRA does the operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision and accuracy of the pixel format . Over 100 functions are hand-coded in assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware . The entire graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize the speed of windowing operations . Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value value in real time as you move the mouse . There are also smooth , real time contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of the displayed image ( s ) , all operated by the mouse . A wide selection of grayscale , pseudocolor , and random palettes is provided , and other palettes can be generated .

By the way , I enjoy science . > It is truly a wonder observing God 's creation . Macroevolution is > a mixture of 15 percent science and 85 percent religion [ guaranteed > within three percent error : ) ] Let us explore this interesting paragraph point by point , sentence by sentence . 1 ) We are talking about origins , not merely science . Origins of what ? Are we speaking of the origins of life , the human species , the universe , physical law , biological diversity or what ? 2 ) Science can not explain origins . This is a false statement unless it is carefully qualified . It depends on what origins we are talking about . 3 ) For a person to exclude anything but science from the issue of origins is to say that there is no higher truth than science . Again , this is a false statement . To begin with , the notion of `` higher truth '' is distinctly dubious . Many people believe that there are ways to ascertain truth that are not in the repetoire of science ; they even believe that there are ways that are more reliable and certain . Many believe that there are truths that can not be expressed using the language of science . Let it be so . These truths are neither `` higher '' or '' lower '' ; they are simply true . More to the point , restricting one 's discussion of origins to science does not reject other sources of knowledge ; it simply restricts the scope of discussion . 4 ) This is a false premise . If this is intended as asserting that the previous sentence was false then ( 4 ) is actually true . However the context identifies it as another false [ or at least theologically unsound ] statement . 5 ) By the way , I enjoy science . On the evidence Mr. Rawlins lacks sufficient understanding of science to enjoy science in any meaningful sense . One might just as well say that one enjoys literature written in a language that one can not read . However one can not mark this sentence as false -- to follow the analogy , perhaps he likes the pretty shapes of the letters . 6 ) It is truly a wonder observing God 's creation . Let us not quibble ; count this one as true . 7 ) Macroevolution is a mixture of 15 percent science and 85 percent religion [ guaranteed within three percent error : ) ] Still another false statement . However one can make it come out true with the following contextual modification : '' Macroevolution , as misunderstood by Rawline , is a mixture of 15 percent of what Rawlins erroneously thinks of as science , and 85 percent of what Rawlins erroneously thinks of as religion . '' -- -- - It is distinctly noticeable that Mr. Rawlins fails miserably to touch on truth except when he reports personally on what he feels . [ I do him the justice of assuming that he is not misinforming us as to his personal reactions . ] One can account for this by the hypothesis that he has an idiosyncratic and personal concept of truth . -- Richard Harter : SMDS Inc.

I do n't think this is true . I think most medical treatments are based on science , although it is difficult to prove anything with certitude . It is true that there are some things that have just been found `` to work '' , but we have no good explanation for why . But almost everything does have a scientific rationale . The most common treatment for prostate cancer is probably hormone therapy . It has been `` proven '' to work . So have radiation and chemotherapy .

Jim , There are a couple of things about your post and others in this thread that are a little confusing . An atheist is one for whom all things can be understood as processes of nature - exclusively . There is no need for any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything . There is no purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by physics , chemistry , biology , etc . ; everything is random , nothing is determnined . This would also have to include human intelligence of course and all its products . There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it acquire intelligence , it 's just a happy accident . For an atheist , no event can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less value than another in any naturalistic sense , and no thought -about- an event can have value . The products of our intelligence are acquired from our environment , from teaching , training , observation and experience and are only significant to the individual mind wherein they reside . These mental processes and the images they produce for us are just electrical activity and nothing more ; content is of no consequence . The human mind is as much a response to natural forces as water running down a hill . How then can an atheist judge value ? What is the basis for criticizing the values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God ? On what grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned ? It seems that , in judging the values that motivate others to action , you have to have some standard against which conduct is measured , but what in nature can serve that purpose ? What law of nature can you invoke to establish your values . Since every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event , what difference could it possibly make what -anyone- does , religious or otherwise , there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value . The only way an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that the objection is entirely subjective and that he ( she ) just does n't like it - that 's it . Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer that it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries no weight in any `` absolute '' sense . That you do n't like what God told people to do says nothing about God or God 's commands , it says only that there was an electrical event in your nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled with a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction . That your objections -seem- well founded is due to the way you 've been conditioned ; there is no `` truth '' content . The whole of your intellectual landscape is an illusion , a virtual reality . I did n't make these rules , it 's inherent in naturalistic atheism and to be consistent , you have to accept the non-significance of any human thought , even your own . All of this being so , you have excluded yourself from any discussion of values , right , wrong , goood , evil , etc . and can not participate . Your opinion about the Bible can have no weight whatsoever . Bill

Version 1.21 is mainly a bugfix for THINK C users . THIS VERSION NOW RUNS WITH THINK C , I PROMISE ! The Docs now contain a chapter for C programmers on how to use the GrafSys . If you have problems , feel free to contact me . The other change is that I removed the FastPerfTrig calls from the FPU version to make it run faster . Those of you who do n't know what all this is about , read on . ******** Programmers 3D GrafSys -- What it is : -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Did n't you always have this great game in mind where you needed some way of drawing three-dimensional scenes ? Did n't you always want to write this program that visualized the structure of three-dimensional molecules ? And did n't the task of writing your 3D conversions routines keep you from actually doing it ? Well if the answer to any of the above questions is 'Yes , but what has it to do with this package ? ? ? ' , read on . GrafSys is a THINK Pascal/C library that provides you with simple routines for building , saving , loading ( as resources ) , and manipulating ( independent rotating around arbitrary achses , translating and scaling ) three dimensional objects . Objects , not just simple single-line drawings . GrafSys supports full 3D clipping , animation and some ( primitive ) hidden- line/hidden-surface drawing with simple commands from within YOUR PROGRAM . GrafSys also supports full eye control with both perspective and parallel projections ( If you ca n't understand a word , do n't worry , this is just showing off for those who know about it . The docs that come with it will try to explain what it all means later on ) . GrafSys provides a powerful interface to supply your own drawing routines with data so you can use GrafSys to do the 3D transformations and your own routines to do the actual drawing . ( Note that GrafSys also provides drawing routines so you do n't have to worry about that if you do n't want to ) GrafSys 1.11 comes in two versions . One for the 881 and 020 or above processors . The other version uses fixed-point arithmetic and runs on any Mac . Both versions are *100 % source compatibel* . GrafSys comes with an extensive manual that teaches you the fundamentals of 3D graphics and how to use the package . If demand is big enough I will convert the GrafSys to an object-class library . However , I feelt that the way it is implemented now makes it easier to use for a lot more people than the select 'OOP-Guild ' . GrafSys is free for any non-commercial usage . Read the documentation enclosed . Enjoy , Christian Franz

Jagr did not have a better season than Francis ... to suggest otherwise is an insult to those with a modicum of hockey knowledge . Save your almost maniacal devotion to the almighty plus/minus ... it is the most misleading hockey stat available . Until the NHL publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic including ice time per game and some measure of its `` quality '' ( i.e. , is the player put out in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game ; is he matched up against the other team 's top one or two lines ; short-handed , etc ) , I would much rather see the +/- disappear altogether instead of having its dubious merits trumpeted by those with little understanding of its implications . Thank you for posting this . As the person who first brought up the fact that Jagr has a much higher +/- than Francis , I can assure you that I brought it up as an example of the absurdity of +/- comparisons , even on the same team . I never , ever thought that anyone would argue that Jagr 's higher +/- actually reflected better two-way play . In my opinion , Francis 's low +/- is purely a result of him being asked to play against opponents top scorers at all times ; the fact that he can chip in 100 points while neutralizing the other team 's top center is a testament to how valuable he is , even if his +/- suffers . On the other hand , Jagr , for how big , fast and skilled he is , ca n't even get 90 points , no matter how inflated his +/- is . ( By the way , do n't get me wrong -- I like Jagr . He may be a lazy floater , but he turns it on at exactly the right times -- like overtime of playoff games ) . -- Roland Dreier dreier @ math.berkeley.edu

The first premise and the conclusion are not properly translated as identity statements , since the `` is '' in those statements is the `` is '' of predication rather than of identity . Instead , they should be translated using a predicate letter . Using `` g '' to designate God and `` j '' to designate Jesus , and the predicate letter `` E '' for the property of being eternal , the first premise is Eg and the conclusion is Ej . The second premise appears to contain an `` is '' of identity , in which case it can be properly symbolized as j = g. But your remark that `` Jesus is a subset of God '' suggests that strict identity is not desired here . If , however , the first premise means that all members making up the set God have the property of being eternal , the same conclusion follows .

It 's normal for the BMW K bikes to use a little oil in the first few thousand miles . I do n't know why . I 've had three new K bikes , and all three used a bit of oil when new - max maybe .4 quart in first 1000 miles ; this soon quits and by the time I had 10,000 miles on them the oil consumption was about zero . I 've been told that the harder you run the bike ( within reason ) the sooner it stops using any oil .

Sorry , but this is the biggest load of bunk I 've seen in a while . a ) The Pirates have been trying to trade LaValliere for some time now . Nobody was even vaguely interested . b ) Several other teams had made it known that they would grab Prince , who was out of options . c ) LaValliere 's release had nothing to do with him being through . He was released , because , in the event of an injury to Slaught , LaValliere is no longer capable ( they believe ) of being the everyday catcher . Since Slaught is as good against righties as he is against lefties , the offense should actually improve with this move . Toby

They were moved in as part of a deliberate policy to prevent the return of the occupied territories . Machiavelli described the reasoning in the Prince . The clear intention was to create a constituency which the Likud beleived could not be deprived of the land stolen from the indigenous population . The pretexts under which the settlers aquired land was through the redefinition of much land used in common as `` public land '' . The assertion that the village common on which the village depends for food belongs to an invader simply because no individual has title is clearly an excuse . When the land is used to build a condominium for aliens brought in to occupy the land for a foreign power there is a clear breach of the Geneva convention which stipulates that land use in occupied territories must not be changed . No amount of self justifying on the part of Likud and hard linner appologists will change the fact that the majority of world governments , and all of those that actually have any power have condemned this practice . | > The government had a number of reasons for encouraging people | > to move across the green line .

Once their US backers had a secure base in the gulf they insrtructed Shamir to negotiate or else . If the creation of settlements had gone on any longer the USA would have cut the money supply . | > The fact that there are a hundered thousands Jews in place | > changes the face of any peace settlement , and restricts what land can | > be given away .

Unless the new boundaries drawn up are those of 48 there will be no peace . Araffat has precious little authority to agree to anything else . The real issue is not the land treaty but the trade treaty . Since the Palestinians will remain heavily dependent on Israel indefinitely it is this that will be the guarantor of peace . another factor will be the return of lands confiscated by the Israeli state within Israel and the dismantling of the shadow structures which allow discrimination against non-Jews within what is nominaly a secular state . The irony is that in return for a guarantee that the palestinian state has a non descrimination law in order to protect the remaining settlers the Israeli state is going to be forced inot the same position . This will mean outlawing of discrimination such as that which prevents arabs from buying or using much of the land . Phill Hallam-Baker

In the 2-1 game , the best pitching staff in the world ca n't compensate for a blown call , a bad hop , a gust of wind .

I am trying to think how to respond to this without involving personal feeling or perceptions and I can not without having stats to back up my points . However , I think you approached this the wrong way . I believe all of the people mentioned here deserve the hall of fame more than Dave Kingman does . I feel they were all much better players . I am not saying I fell they deserve to go but that they would deserve it more . IMHO Dave Kingman - definately not . They guy only had a couple of years were he could hit with atleast a respectable averag . The rest of his career I do not think he was very feared by pitchers . I also do not think he did a lot for the game . I mean really I am a Met fan - he was a Met for part of his career and I still would not back him for the Hall of Fame . Dave Winfield - I think so . He is feared by pitchers , he has had several season where he hit for a respectable average and his production numbers are ( in my opinion - without stats ) better than Kingman 's ( probably by quite a bit ) . I also perceive him to be a leader , maybe not as much as some other people but none the less a leader . I think he has made substantial contributions to the game of baseball and to society . Examples of this are some of the charitable things he has done ( I know some of this from when he was with the Yankees ) . I think he the type of player that kids can look up to and while this is definately not the only criteria for the Hall of Fame I think it deserves some consideration . Lee Smith - Maybe , I would have to see his stats again but he definately would deserve to go before the likes of Kingman . Darrell Evans - No . Eddie Murray - Maybe , He has had a very good career , he is a leader ( although a silent one ) , he is a good role model . Are the stats good enough ? I am not sure - but I would once again believe they are much better than Kingman 's both the average as well as the power numbers ( but not as good as Winfield 's ) . Just think , Eddie did not have as much publicity for most of his great years . Jeff Reardon - My guess is no , but it kind of depends on his numbers . Off the top of my head I would take Lee Smith first . | > | > Well , in any case , I am sick and tired ( mostly sick ) of everybody | > giving | > | > Hall of Fame consideration to players that are by today 's standards , | > marginal . | > | > Honestly , Ozzie Smith and Robin Yount do n't belong there . They 're both | > | > shortstops that just hung around for a long time . Big deal . | > Well , I strongly disagree here . Both of these guys deserve it for sure . I talked about leadership above , both of these guys are leaders and have been instumental in leading their teams to the post season . Robin does have very good offensive numbers both average and power and Ozzie has okay numbers offensively . The difference with Ozzie is that if you gave him a home run for every run he saved by making an incredible play at shortstop - he would have shattered Aaron 's home run mark by now . How many of those great plays saved games ? How many of those great plays motivated his team to rally and win a game ? While I believe both of these guys have numbers , baseball is about more than numbers ( or at least winning at baseball is about more than numbers ) . Both of these guys are proven stars and belong in the Hall of Fame . As does George Brett who also belongs in this class of player . | > Let 's be a little more selective , huh ?

Face it , if | > something | > | > is n't done , there will be little prestige in the Hall of Fame anymore . When | > | > certain individuals believe that Steve Garvey or Jack Morris are potential | > | > candidates , the absurdity is apparent . Gee , can these guys even compare to | > | > the more likely future Hall of Famers like Kirby Puckett or Nolan Ryan ? | > Steve Garvey - I am not sure , probably not but I guess I could see someone making a case for him . Jack Morris - Once again not my first choice but I can see why someone might bring up his name . Kirby Puckett - Probably . The only reason I do not say definately is he still has time left in his career . If he continues doing what he has been then my probably will turn into a definately . Nolan Ryan - Is there really any doubt ? I think I heard something about him having some 53 records ( maybe they were not all good - I do n't know I did not hear any of them just the number ) . He has the numbers , he has the contributions to the game and community and he is a great role model . I would not say that he is the best pitcher to ever pitch the game ( probably not even top 20 ) but he would be the first pitcher I would put in the Hall of Fame because of his accomplishments ( no-hitters , strikeouts , respectable numbers - even with some weaker teams ) you can go on and on . I really hope he gets ALL the possible votes . So in summing up I have 3 groups , those that belong , those that probably do but I am not sure and those that I lean towards saying do n't belong at least not without my seeing stats and possibly hearing reasons why they should go . Yes - Winfield , Yount , Brett ( not in your mail ) , O. Smith , Puckett and Ryan Maybe - Murray and L. Smith No - Reardon , Garvey , Morris , Evans and definately Kingman As I said I do not have the stats around so I do not have numbers to back this up - these are entirely my opinions based on my perceptions .

Who knows how old 1.15 is . 2.5 is as fast as TT , and if > you disable the small screen fonts , ATM does better screen rendering at > the smaller point sizes . Not true ! Both Type 1 and TT fonts can be of excellent quality and poor quality at any size . It all depends on the font 's maker and the complexity of the glyphs related to the size and resolution at which they are viewed . Probably the reason for your opinion/experience that TT is inferior is because most TT fonts on the market today have been converted from Type 1 outlines to TT either by the font vendor or end-users using Fontographer or FontMonger instead of the TT fonts being hand-hinted to take advantage of the TT hinting language . At best these converted TT fonts will be on a par with the Type 1 font of its orgin . TrueType is a much richer and more robust hinting language than Type 1 ( the hinting of diagonals for instance , which TT does and Type 1 can not ) . If you check out the Windows 3.1 core fonts ( Times , Arial , Courier , Symbol , Wingdings ) you 'll see what can be done with TT . There are other fonts out there that have been hand-hinted and not just converted . Some of the Microsoft TT Font Pack 2 fonts are hinted very well . > You can use both TT and ATM fonts at the same time , if you like . > ATM ( Type 1 ) fonts tend to be of higher quality > and be more complete in terms of foreign characters . Again , not true . The characters in a TT or Type 1 font depend on the maker . If someone converts a Type 1 font to TT they 'll only get the characters in the font of orgin . TT allows for much more flexibility in this area as well . You can have thousands of glyphs in a TT font file ( Mac/PS/Windows/Unicode char set ) and use the characters appropriate for the particular platform you are running the font on . For instance , all or our fontpack 2 TT fonts have the Mac/Windows char set in them . The metrics of the fonts are such that if the font is brought over to the mac the user will have access to the full mac char set . > Regards , 1001-A East Harmony Road > Bob Niland Suite 503 > Internet : rjn @ csn.org Fort Collins CO 80525 > CompuServe : 71044,2124 ( 303 ) 223-5209 Hope this clears up some of the confusion .

Xt Glossary -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- o The Xt Intrinsics implement an object oriented interface to C code to allow useful graphical components to be created . Included with this are classes that provide the base functionality : Object , RectObj , Core , Composite , Constraint , Shell , OverrideShell , WMShell , etc . The terms `` Xt '' and `` Intrinsics '' are used interchangeably , however , they are used very precisely to mean a specific library of the X window system . In particular , it does not include the Athena , Motif , OLIT or any other widget set . Without further widgets the Intrinsics are not especially useful . o A widget refers to a user interface abstraction created via Xt . The precise use , is any object that is a subclass of the Core class . It is used loosely to refer to anything that is a subclass of the Object class although these are more accurately called windowless widgets or gadgets . o Xlib is the C interface to the X11 protocol . It is one layer below the Xt Intrinsics . Typically a widget uses relatively few Xlib functions because Xt provides most such services although an understanding of Xlib helps with problems . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 1 .

Why does my application core dump when I use signals/alarms/cthreads ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- In brief , Xlib , Xt and most widget sets have no mutual exclusion for critical sections . Any interrupt handler is likely to leave one of the above libraries in an inconsistent state -- such as all the appropriate flags not yet set , dangling pointers , in the middle of a list traversal , etc . Note that the ANSI C standard points out that behavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls any function other than signal ( ) itself , so this is not a problem specific to Xlib and Xt ; the POSIX specification mentions other functions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed that these functions are called by Xlib or Xt functions . The only safe way to deal with signals is to set a flag in the interrupt handler . This flag later needs to be checked either by a work procedure or a timeout callback . It is incorrect to add either of these in the interrupt handler . As another note , it is dangerous to add a work procedure that never finishes . This effectively preempts any work procedures previously added and so they will never be called . Another option is to open a pipe , tell the event loop about the read end using XtAppAddInput ( ) and then the signal handler can write a byte to the write end of the pipe for each signal . However , this could deadlock your process if the pipe fills up . Why do n't the Intrinsics deal with this problem ? Primarily because it is supposed to be a portable layer to any hardware and operating system . Is that a good enough reason -- I do n't think so . Note : the article in The X Journal 1:4 and the example in O'Reilly Volume 6 are in error . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 4 . How do I use a different visual than the default ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- This requires a more complicated answer than it should . A window has three things that are visual specific -- the visual , colormap and border pixmap . All widgets have their own Colormap and BorderPixmap resource ; only shell widgets have Visual resources ( another questions deals with why shells have a Visual ) . The default value of these resources is CopyFromParent which does exactly what it says . In the shell widget CopyFromParent gets evalulated as DefaultVisualOfScreen and DefaultColormapOfScreen . When any one of the three resources is not properly set , a BadMatch error occurs when the window is created . They are not properly set because each of the values depends on the visual being used . How to get this to work ? There are two parts to the answer . The first is if you want an application to start with a particular visual and the second is if you want a particular shell within an application to start with a different visual . The second is actually easier because the basic information you need is available . The first is a little harder because you 'll need to initialize much of the toolkit yourself in order to determine the needed information . /* * Some sample code to start up an application using something other * than the default visual . * * To compile : * cc -g visual.c -o visual -lXaw -lXmu -lXt -lXext -lX11 -lm * * To run : * ./visual -geometry 300x300 -depth 24 -visual StaticColor -fg blue -bg yellow * * you need to move the mouse to get the particular visuals colormap * to install . */ # include < X11/Intrinsic.h > # include < X11/StringDefs.h > # include < X11/Shell.h > typedef struct { Visual *visual ; int depth ; } OptionsRec ; OptionsRec Options ; XtResource resources [ ] = { { `` visual '' , `` Visual '' , XtRVisual , sizeof ( Visual * ) , XtOffsetOf ( OptionsRec , visual ) , XtRImmediate , NULL } , { `` depth '' , `` Depth '' , XtRInt , sizeof ( int ) , XtOffsetOf ( OptionsRec , depth ) , XtRImmediate , NULL } , } ; XrmOptionDescRec Desc [ ] = { { `` -visual '' , `` *visual '' , XrmoptionSepArg , NULL } , { `` -depth '' , `` *depth '' , XrmoptionSepArg , NULL } } ; int main ( argc , argv ) int argc ; char **argv ; { XtAppContext app ; /* the application context */ Widget top ; /* toplevel widget */ Display *dpy ; /* display */ char **xargv ; /* saved argument vector */ int xargc ; /* saved argument count */ Colormap colormap ; /* created colormap */ XVisualInfo vinfo ; /* template for find visual */ XVisualInfo *vinfo_list ; /* returned list of visuals */ int count ; /* number of matchs ( only 1 ? ) */ Arg args [ 10 ] ; Cardinal cnt ; char *name = `` test '' ; char *class = `` Test '' ; /* * save the command line arguments */ xargc = argc ; xargv = ( char ** ) XtMalloc ( argc * sizeof ( char * ) ) ; bcopy ( ( char * ) argv , ( char * ) xargv , argc * sizeof ( char * ) ) ; /* * The following creates a _dummy_ toplevel widget so we can * retrieve the appropriate visual resource . */ cnt = 0 ; top = XtAppInitialize ( & app , class , Desc , XtNumber ( Desc ) , & argc , argv , ( String * ) NULL , args , cnt ) ; dpy = XtDisplay ( top ) ; cnt = 0 ; XtGetApplicationResources ( top , & Options , resources , XtNumber ( resources ) , args , cnt ) ; cnt = 0 ; if ( Options.visual & & Options.visual ! = DefaultVisualOfScreen ( XtScreen ( top ) ) ) { XtSetArg ( args [ cnt ] , XtNvisual , Options.visual ) ; ++cnt ; /* * Now we create an appropriate colormap .

Which visual should an application use ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- This is a point that can be argued about but one opinion is there is no way for an application to know the appropriate visual -- it has to be specified by the user . If you disagree with this then your application probably falls into the category of always using the default visual or it is hardware specific and expects some particular visual such as 24bit TrueColor with an OverlayPlane extension ( or some such ) . Why ? No application runs in isolation . Depending on the way a server allocates resources I may not always want your application to run in TrueColor mode if it is going to mess up my other applications . I may be very upset if it chooses to run in GreyScale instead of PsuedoColor or just monochrome . As an example , on a low end color Sun server there are many different possible visuals : monochrome , 256 entry colormap , static gray , static color , and a 3/3/2 TrueColor . The SGI Iris 's offer all the above plus 12 bit TrueColor , 24 bit TrueColor , an Overlay Plane . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 6 . Why do only Shell widgets have a Visual ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- This is strictly by convention . It makes it possible for an arbitrary widget to know that the visual it uses can be found by looking for the shell widget that is its ancestor and obtaining the visual of that shell . A widget can have its own visual resource . If it does , it must have its own realize method to use the visual when it calls XCreateWindow ( ) . You should also make this a resource that can be obtained with XtGetValues ( ) so other widgets can find it . A reasonable value is probably XtNvisual . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 7 .

If the parent of the widget is not null , then the shell copies colormap and depth from its parent and uses CopyFromParent as the visual . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 8 .

This was especially true of X11R3 and earlier versions of Motif . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 9 . Why does n't my widget get destroyed when I call XtDestroyWidget ( ) ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- See section 2.8 of the Xt specification . It eventually does get destroyed , just not immediately . The Intrinsics destroy a widget in a two-phase process . First it and all of its children have a flag set that indicate it is being destroyed . It is then put on a list of widgets to be destroyed . This way any pending X events or further references to that widget can be cleaned up before the memory is actually freed . The second phase is then performed after all callbacks , event handlers , and actions have completed , before checking for the next X event . At this point the list is traversed and each widget 's memory is actually free ( ) 'd , among other things . As some further caveats/trivia , the widgets may be destroyed if the Intrinsics determine that they have no further references to the widgets on the list . If so , then the phase 2 destruction occurs immediately . Also , if nested event loops are used , widgets placed on the destroy list before entering the inner event loop are not destroyed until returning to the outer event loop . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 10 . How do I exit but still execute the DestroyCallbacks ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- The problem is if a simple and entirely reasonable approach to exiting an application is used , such as calling exit ( ) directly , then a widget may not have a chance to clean up any external state -- such as open sockets , temporary files , allocated X resources , etc . ( this code for simplicity reasons assumes only a single toplevel widget ) : Widget ToplevelGet ( gw ) Widget gw ; /* widget to find toplevel */ { Widget top ; for ( top = gw ; XtParent ( top ) ; top = XtParent ( top ) ) /* empty */ ; return ( top ) ; } void ExitCallback ( gw , closure , call_data ) Widget gw ; /* widget */ XtPointer closure ; /* data the app specified */ XtPointer call_data ; /* widget specific data */ { Widget toplevel ; toplevel = ToplevelGet ( gw ) ; XtUnmapWidget ( toplevel ) ; /* make it disappear quickly */ XtDestroyWidget ( toplevel ) ; exit ( 0 ) ; } One can see that the above code exit 's immediately after destroying the toplevel widget . The trouble is the phase 2 destruction may never occur . This works for most widgets and most applications but will not work for those widgets that have any external state . You might think that since it works now it will always work but remember that part of the reason an object oriented approach is used is so one can be ignorant of the implementation details for each widget . Which means that the widget may change and someday require that some external state is cleaned up by the Destroy callbacks . One alternative is to modify ExitCallback ( ) to set a global flag and then test for that flag in a private event loop . However , private event loops are frowned upon because it tends to encourage sloppy , and difficult to maintain practices . Try the following code instead . # include < X11/Intrinsic.h > extern Widget ToplevelGet ( # if NeedFunctionPrototypes Widget gw # endif ) ; extern Boolean ExitWorkProc ( # if NeedFunctionPrototypes XtPointer closure # endif ) ; extern void ExitCallback ( # if NeedFunctionPrototypes Widget gw , XtPointer closure , XtPointer call_data # endif ) ; Widget ToplevelGet ( gw ) Widget gw ; /* widget to find toplevel */ { Widget top ; for ( top = gw ; XtParent ( top ) ; top = XtParent ( top ) ) /* empty */ ; return ( top ) ; } void ExitCallback ( gw , closure , call_data ) Widget gw ; /* widget */ XtPointer closure ; /* data the app specified */ XtPointer call_data ; /* widget specific data */ { Widget toplevel ; toplevel = ToplevelGet ( gw ) ; XtUnmapWidget ( toplevel ) ; /* make it disappear quickly */ XtDestroyWidget ( toplevel ) ; XtAppAddWorkProc ( XtWidgetToApplicationContext ( gw ) , ExitWorkProc , ( XtPointer ) NULL ) ; } Boolean ExitWorkProc ( closure ) XtPointer closure ; { exit ( 0 ) ; /*NOTREACHED*/ } ExitCallback ( ) adds a work procedure that will get called when the application is next idle -- which happens after all the events are processed and the destroy callbacks are executed . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 11 . How do I resize a Shell widget ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- After it is realized , one does n't resize a Shell widget . The proper thing is to resize the currently managed child of the Shell widget using XtSetValues ( ) . The geometry change is then propagated to the Shell which asks the window manager which may or may not allow the request . However , the Shell must have the resource XtNallowShellResize set to True otherwise it will not even ask the window manager to grant the request and the Shell will not resize . To change the position of a Shell , use XtSetValues ( ) on the Shell , not the child , and within the limits of the window manager it should be granted . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 12 . Why ca n't XtAppAddInput ( ) handle files ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- It does , however Unix semantics for when I/O is ready for a file does not fit most peoples ' intuitive model . In Unix terms a file descriptor is ready for reading whenever the read ( ) call would not block , ignoring the setting of optional flags that indicate not to block . This works as expected for terminals , sockets and pipes . For a file the read ( ) will always return but the return indicates an EOF -- i.e . no more data . The result is the code in the Intrinsics always calls the input handler because it always thinks something is about to be read . The culprit is the select ( ) system call or on SYSV based OS 's it is the poll ( ) system call . How to get around this on a Unix system ? The best approach is to use another process to check for available input on the file . Use a pipe to connect the application with this other process and pass the file descriptor from the pipe to XtAppAddInput ( ) . A suitable program on BSD systems is `` tail -f filename '' . It 's rumored that select ( ) on some systems is not _completely_ reliable . In particular : - IBM AIX 3.1 : this is one where it would work for a while ( several thousand times ) and then stop until some other event woke it up . This seemed to be the result of a race condition in the Kernel . IBM claims to have a fix for this . - Pyramid , does n't work at all . - Ultrix ( and possibly others where pipes are implemented as sockets ) , was n't completely broken , but although the writing side wrote in 512 byte blocks the reading side received it all broken up as if it was being put into the pipe a byte at a time . You can waste a lot of time by reading small blocks ( get raound it by detecting the situation and having select ( ) ignore the pipe for 10 mseconds - by then it had been given the whole block ) . Note that all the above descriptions used Unix terminology such as read ( ) , file descriptor , pipes , etc . This is an OS dependent area and may not be identical on all systems . However the Intrinsic designers felt it was a common enough operation that it should be included with part of the toolkit . Why they did n't also deal with signals at this point I do n't know . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 13 .

What Widgets are available ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- There are three popular widget sets : Athena - The set provided with X11 . This is sufficient for most purposes but is on the ugly side . Recently , a 3d look is available for ftp on export.lcs.mit.edu : /contrib/Xaw3d.tar.Z . Motif - From OSF available for a license fee and commonly shipped on many workstation vendors platforms ( almost everyone but Sun ) . It looks good and works well but personally I think it is poorly implemented . OLIT - The Open Look Intrinsics Toolkit is a set of widgets implementing Sun 's Open Look specification . Developed by AT & T . I 've never used it so ca n't comment on its quality . I 've heard rumours that it is a pain to actually get . In addition the following collection of widgets are also available : Xtra - a library of widgets for sale from Graphical Software Technology ( 310-328-9338 ) . It includes bar graph , stacked bar graph , line graph , pie chart , xy plot , hypertext , help , spreadsheet , and data entry form widgets . I 've never seen them so I ca n't comment . FWF - The Free Widget Foundation is attempting to collect a set of freely available widgets . Included are a Pixmap editor , FileDialog , and a few others . The current set of widgets can be obtained via anonymous ftp from the machine a.cs.uiuc.edu ( 128.174.252.1 ) in the file pub/fwf.shar.Z . Xcu - The Cornell University widgets from Gene Dykes . One of the early widget sets released . Provides a nice appearance for buttons and has a mini command language . Probably not so widely used . Xs - The Sony widget set . This was around during R3 days but seemed to disappear . It looked like it had promise . Xw - The HP widgets . The precursor to Motif . Originally written for R3 there exists diffs to get it to work under R4 & R5 . Again , a pretty good widget set but has more or less died . The precursor to this was the Xray toolkit which was originally implemented for X10R4 and apparently provided much experience for the designers of Xt . Xo - A widget set I 'm working on . It 's still primitive but you can give it a try in archive.cis.ohio-state.edu : pub/Xo/* The following specialized widgets are also available : Tbl - Implements a tabular layout of widgets .

When the value is copied into the widget resource , the bit pattern is wildly different than that required for a floating point value . So , how to get around this ? The following macro is from the Athena widgets document and I am now recomending it over the previous suggestions . # define XtSetFloatArg ( arg , n , d ) \ if ( sizeof ( float ) > sizeof ( XtArgVal ) ) { \ XtSetArg ( arg , n , & ( d ) ) ; \ } else { \ XtArgVal *ld = ( XtArgVal * ) & ( d ) ; \ XtSetArg ( arg , n , *ld ) ; \ } -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 17 . How do I write a resource converter ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Courtesy of Rich Thomson ( rthomson @ dsd.es.com ) : The following discussion of resource converters assumes R4 ( or R5 ) Intrinsics . Resource converters changed between R3 and R4 to allow for destructors and caching of converted values . There are several main types of resource converters : string to data type data type to string data type to data type i ) string to data type Usually a string to data type converter has a fixed set of strings that will be converted to data type values . This is most often used to map enumerated names to enumerated values : Name Value '' True '' 1 '' False '' 0 In this case , the string to data type converter needs to compare the resource value to the list of fixed strings . This is most readily accomplished by the use of the `` quark '' mechanism of the resource manager . The resource value is turned into a quark , which is a unique representation of the string that fits into a single word . Then the resource quark is compared against the quarks for the fixed strings representing the enumerated values . If there are many enumerated strings in the converter ( or many converters , each with a small number of enumeration strings ) , then a global initialization routine might be used to turn all the resource strings into quarks . That way , the first time one of these converters is used , the strings will be turned into quarks and held in static variables for use in the next invocation of one of the converters . ii ) data type to string This type of converter is slightly easier than the string to data type converters since the use of quarks is n't necessary . Instead , the data type value is simply converted to a string value , probably by the use of sprintf . Data type to string converters are useful for applications that wish to convert an internal data type value into a string so that they can write out a valid resource specification to a file . This mechanism can be used to provide a `` snapshot '' of application state into a file . This snapshot can be used to restore the program to a known state via the usual X resource database mechanisms . If you are taking the trouble to write a string to data type converter , it is n't much extra effort to write the data type to string converter . Writing both at the same time helps to ensure that they are consistent . iii ) data type to data type This type of converter is used to convert an existing data type value to another data type . For instance , an X pixel value can be converted to an RGB data type that contains separate fields for red , green and blue . The type signature for a resource converter is as follows : typedef Boolean ( *XtTypeConverter ) ( Display * , XrmValuePtr , Cardinal * , XrmValuePtr , XrmValuePtr , XtPointer * ) ; Display *dpy ; XrmValuePtr args ; Cardinal *num_args ; XrmValuePtr fromVal ; XrmValuePtr toVal ; XtPointer *converter_data ; When the converter is invoked , the `` fromVal '' argument points to the source X resource manager value and the `` toVal '' argument points to the destination X resource manager value . The `` converter_data '' argument is an opaque pointer to some converter-specific data that is specified when the converter is registered . The `` args '' and `` num_args '' arguments allow extra information to be passed to the converter when it is invoked . For instance , the Pixel to RGB structure converter discussed above would need colormap and visual arguments in which to lookup the Pixel to obtain the RGB values corresponding to that pixel . Care must be taken with the `` toVal '' argument . An XrmValue has the following type definition and specifies a size and location for a converted value : typedef struct { unsigned int size ; caddr_t addr ; } XrmValue , *XrmValuePtr ; When the converter is invoked , the address may point to a location of the given size for the converted value or the location can be NULL . In the former case , the converter should ensure that the size of the destination area is large enough to handle the converted value . If the destination area is not large enough , then the converter should set the size to the amount of space needed and return False . The caller can then ensure that enough space is allocated and reinvoke the converter . If the size is large enough , then the converter can simply copy the converted value into the space given and return True . If the location is NULL , then the converter can assign the location to the address of a static variable containing the converted value and return True . When writing a group of converters , this code is often repeated and it becomes convenient to define a macro : # define DONE ( var , type ) \ if ( toVal- > addr ) \ { \ if ( toVal- > size < sizeof ( type ) ) \ { \ toVal- > size = sizeof ( type ) ; \ return False ; \ } \ else \ * ( ( type * ) toVal- > addr ) = var ; \ } \ else \ toVal- > addr = ( caddr_t ) & var ; \ toVal- > size = sizeof ( type ) ; \ return True ; # define DONESTR ( str ) \ if ( toVal- > addr & & toVal- > size < sizeof ( String ) ) \ { \ toVal- > size = sizeof ( String ) ; \ return False ; \ } \ else \ toVal- > addr = ( caddr_t ) str ; \ toVal- > size = sizeof ( String ) ; \ return True ; Inside the converter , it is a good idea to perform a little safety checking on the `` num_args '' and `` args '' arguments to ensure that your converter is being called properly . Once you have written your converter , you need to register it with the Intrinsics . The Intrinsics invokes resource converters when creating widgets and fetching their resource values from the resource database . To register a converter with a single application context , use XtAppSetTypeConverter : void XtAppSetTypeConverter ( context , from , to , converter , args , num_args , cache , destructor ) XtAppContext context ; String from ; String to ; XtTypeConverter converter ; XtConvertArgList args ; Cardinal num_args ; XtCacheType cache ; XtDestructor destructor ; To register a converter with all application contexts , use XtSetTypeConverter : void XtSetTypeConverter ( from , to , converter , args , num_args , cache , destructor ) String from ; String to ; XtTypeConverter converter ; XtConvertArgList args ; Cardinal num_args ; XtCacheType cache ; XtDestructor destructor ; In the R3 Intrinsics , there were the routines XtAppAddConverter and XtAddConverter ; these have been superseded by XtAppSetTypeConverter and XtSetTypeConverter . Whenever possible , the newer routines should be used . When a converter is registered with the Intrinsics , a `` cache '' argument specifies how converted resource values are to be cached : XtCacheNone Do n't cache any converted values XtCacheAll Cache all converted values XtCacheByDisplay Cache converted values on a per display basis Caching converted values that require a round-trip to the server is a good idea ( for instance string to Pixel conversions ) . The `` destructor '' argument is a routine that is invoked then the resource is destroyed , either because its cached reference count has been decremented to zero or because the widget owning the value is being destroyed . XtDestructor has the following type definition : typedef void ( *XtDestructor ) ( XtAppContext , XrmValuePtr , XtPointer , XrmValuePtr , Cardinal * ) ; XtAppContext context ; XrmValuePtr to ; XtPointer converter_data ; XrmValuePtr args ; Cardinal *num_args ; The destructor is invoked to free any auxiliary storage associated with the `` to '' argument , but does not actually free the storage pointed to by the `` to '' argument itself ( to- > addr ) . The destructor is passed the extra arguments that were passed to the converter when the conversion was performed ( for instance , colormap and visual arguments for the string to Pixel converter since the destructor would need to free the allocated Pixel from the colormap ) as well as the private data passed in when the converter was registered . Sample converter code can be found in the following files in the MIT R5 distribution : mit/lib/Xt/Converters.c contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.c contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.h -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 18 . How do I open multiple displays ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- See `` Multi-user Application Software Using Xt '' , The X Resource , Issue 3 , ( Summer 1992 ) by Oliver Jones for a complete coverage of the issues involved . Most of this answer is based on that article . In a nutshell , one uses XtOpenDisplay ( ) to add each display to a _single_ application context and then XtCloseDisplay ( ) to shutdown each display and remove it from the application context . The real problems occur when trying to close down a display . This can happen 3 ways : 1 . User selects a `` quit '' button on one of the displays , 2 . User has window manager send a WM_DELETE_WINDOW message , 3 . Server disconnect -- possibly from a KillClient message , server shutdown/crash , or network failure . I 'll assume you can deal gracefully with 1 & 2 since it is _merely_ a problem of translating a Widget to a display and removing that display . If not , then read the Oliver Jones article . The third one is difficult to handle . The following is based on the Oliver Jones article and I include it here because it is a difficult problem . The difficulty arises because the Xlib design presumed that an I/O error is always unrecoverable and so fatal . This is essentially true for a single display X based application , but not true for a multiple display program or an application that does things other than display information on an X server . When an X I/O error occurs the I/O error handler is called and _if_ it returns then an exit ( ) happens . The only way around this is to use setjmp/longjmp to avoid returning to the I/O error handler . The following code fragment demonstrates this : # include < setjmp.h > jmp_buf XIOrecover ; void XIOHandler ( dpy ) Display *dpy ; { destroyDisplay ( dpy ) ; longjmp ( XIOrecover , 1 ) ; } main ( ) { ... if ( setjmp ( XIOrecover ) == 0 ) XSetIOErrorHandler ( XIOHandler ) ; XtAppMainLoop ( app_context ) ; } The destroyDisplay ( ) is something that given a Display pointer can go back to the application specific data and perform any necessary cleanup . It should also call XtCloseDisplay ( ) . For those of you unfamiliar with setjmp/longjmp , when setjmp ( ) is first called it returns a 0 and save 's enough information in the jmp_buf that a latter execution of longjmp ( ) can return the program to the same state as if the setjmp ( ) was just executed . The return value of this second setjmp ( ) is the value of the second argument to longjmp ( ) . There are several caveats about using these but for this purpose it is adequate . Some other problems you might run into are resource converters that improperly cache resources . The most likely symptoms are Xlib errors such as BadColor , BadAtom , or BadFont . There may be problems with the total number of displays you can open since typically only a limited number of file descriptors are available with 32 being a typical value . You may also run into authorization problems when trying to connect to a display . There was much discussion in comp.windows.x about this topic in November of 91 . Robert Scheifler posted an article which basically said this is the way it will be and Xlib will not change . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 19 .

Where are the resources loaded from ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- The resources of a widget are filled in from the following places ( from highest priority to lowest priority ) : 1 . Args passed at creation time . 2 . Command line arguments . 3 . User 's per host defaults file 4 . User 's defaults file . 5 . User 's per application default file . 6 . System wide per application default file . Note that 2-6 are read only once on application startup . The result of steps 3-6 is a single resource database used for further queries . The per host defaults file contains customizations for all applications executing on a specific computer . This file is either specified with the XENVIRONMENT environment variable or if that is not set then the file $ HOME/.Xdefaults- < host > is used . The user defaults file is either obtained from the RESOURCE_MANAGER property on the root window of the display or if that is not set then the file $ HOME/.Xdefaults is used . Typically , the program `` xrdb '' is used to set the RESOURCE_MANAGER property . Please note that this should be kept relatively small as each client that connects to the display must transfer the property . A size of around 1-3KByte is reasonable . Some toolkits may track changes to the RESOURCE_MANAGER but most do not . A user may have many per application default files containing customizations specific to each application . The intrinsics are quite flexible on how this file is found . Read the next part that describes the various environment variables and how they effect where this file is found . The system wide per application default files are typically found in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults . If such a file is not found then the fallback resources are used . The intrinsics are quite flexible on how this file is found . Read the next part that describes the various environment variables and how they effect where this file is found . [ Thanks to Oliver Jones ( oj @ pictel.com ) for the following , 6/92 ] You can use several environment variables to control how resources are loaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH , XUSERFILESEARCHPATH , and XAPPLRESDIR . These environment variables control where Xt looks for application-defaults files as an application is initializing . Xt loads at most one app-defaults file from the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from the path defined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH . Set XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a way that app-defaults files appear in several different directory hierarchies . Suppose , for example , that you are running Sun 's Open Windows , and you also have some R4 X applications installed in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults . You could set a value like this for XFILESEARCHPATH , and it would cause Xt to look up app-defaults files in both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib ( or wherever your OPENWINHOME is located ) : setenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/ % T/ % N : $ OPENWINHOME/lib/ % T/ % N The value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of pathnames . The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows ( see XtResolvePathname ( ) ) : % N The value of the filename parameter , or the application 's class name . % T The value of the file `` type '' . In this case , the literal string `` app-defaults '' % C customization resource ( R5 only ) % S Suffix . None for app-defaults . % L Language , locale , and codeset ( e.g . `` ja_JP.EUC '' ) % l Language part of % L ( e.g . `` ja '' ) % t The territory part of the display 's language string % c The codeset part of the display 's language string Let 's take apart the example . Suppose the application 's class name is '' Myterm '' . Also , suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin . ( Notice the example omits locale-specific lookup . ) /usr/lib/X11/ % T/ % N means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm $ OPENWINHOME/lib/ % T/ % N means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/Myterm As the application initializes , Xt tries to open both of the above app-defaults files , in the order shown . As soon as it finds one , it reads it and uses it , and stops looking for others . The effect of this path is to search first in /usr/lib/X11 , then in /usr/openwin . Let 's consider another example . This time , let 's set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the current working directory , then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults . setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./ % N.ad : $ HOME/app-defaults/ % N The first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad . The second expands to $ HOME/app-defaults/Myterm . This is a convenient setting for debugging because it follows the Imake convention of naming the app-defaults file Myterm.ad in the application 's source directory , so you can run the application from the directory in which you are working and still have the resources loaded properly . NOTE : when looking for app-default files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH , for some bizarre reason , neither the type nor file suffix is defined so % T and % S are useless . With R5 , there 's another twist . You may specify a customization resource value . For example , you might run the `` myterm '' application like this : myterm -xrm `` *customization : -color '' If one of your pathname specifications had the value '' /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/ % N % C '' then the expanded pathname would be '' /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color '' because the % C substitution character takes on the value of the customization resource . The default XFILESEARCHPATH , compiled into Xt , is : /usr/lib/X11/ % L/ % T/ % N % C : \ ( R5 ) /usr/lib/X11/ % l/ % T/ % N % C : \ ( R5 ) /usr/lib/X11/ % T/ % N % C : \ ( R5 ) /usr/lib/X11/ % L/ % T/ % N : \ /usr/lib/X11/ % l/ % T/ % N : \ /usr/lib/X11/ % T/ % N ( Note : some sites replace /usr/lib/X11 with a ProjectRoot in this batch of default settings . ) The default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH , also compiled into Xt , is < root > / % L/ % N % C : \ ( R5 ) < root > / % l/ % N % C : \ ( R5 ) < root > / % N % C : \ ( R5 ) < root > / % L/ % N : \ < root > / % l/ % N : \ < root > / % N : < root > is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user 's home directory if XAPPLRESDIR is not set . If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some value other than the default , Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether . Notice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find your app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set XAPPLRESDIR to `` . `` , a single dot . In R3 , all this machinery worked differently ; for R3 compatibilty , many people set their XAPPLRESDIR value to `` ./ '' , a dot followed by a slash . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 21 . What order are callbacks executed in ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- ( Courtesy of Donna Converse , converse @ expo.lcs.mit.edu ; 5/10/92 ) The Intrinsics library do not guarantee an order . This is because both the widget writer and the application writer have the ability to modify the entire contents of the callback list . Neither one currently knows what the other is doing and so the Intrinsics can not guarantee the order of execution . The application programmer can not rely on the widget writer ; the widget writer is not required to document when the widget will add and remove callbacks from the list or what effect this will have ; therefore the functionality contained in a callback should be independent of the functionality contained in other callbacks on the list . Even though the Xt standard in the definition of XtAddCallback says : '' callback_name : Specifies the callback list to which the procedure is to be appended . '' you may not infer from the word `` appended '' that the callback routines are called in the same order as they have been added to the callback list . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 22 .

I set the visible > interest field in Core and if my window is completely obscured , the Core > visible flag goes FALSE . However , if my window is iconified , the flag > stays set to TRUE . Right , everything is implemented correctly . This demonstrates a `` deficiency '' in the X protocol , and the Core widget is reflecting the capabilities of the protocol . ( The `` deficiency '' is that the information is available in one way , in this case an inconvenient way . ) The Xt specification is accurate , in the second and third paragraphs of section 7.10.2 , so read this section carefully . The visible field will not change in response to iconification . A VisibilityNotify event will not be received when the window goes from viewable to unviewable , that is , when the widget or an ancestor is unmapped ; that is , when iconification occurs . This is the protocol deficiency . Visibility state and viewable state have specific meanings in the X protocol ; see the glossary in your Xlib and X protocol reference manual . > Is this a problem with `` mwm '' or is there something > else which needs to be done ? You 'll see this with any window manager , with no window manager . > If the problem is `` mwm '' , what is the fastest > way to determine if a window is iconified ? As an application writer , keep track with a global Boolean in an action routine with translations for MapNotify and UnmapNotify on the Shell widget which contains your custom widget . As the custom widget writer , see the map_state field returned by a call to XGetWindowAttributes . These are suggestions . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 23 . How do I reparent a widget in Xt , i.e .

Why use XtMalloc , XtFree , etc ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Unfortunately , most code that calls malloc ( ) , realloc ( ) or calloc ( ) tends to ignore the possibility of returning NULL . At best it is handled something like : ptr = ( type * ) malloc ( sizeof ( type ) ) if ( ! ptr ) { perror ( `` malloc in xyzzy ( ) '' ) ; exit ( 1 ) } To handle this common case the Intrinsics define the functions XtMalloc ( ) , XtCalloc ( ) , XtNew ( ) , XtNewString ( ) and XtRealloc ( ) which all use the standard C language functions malloc ( ) , calloc ( ) and realloc ( ) but execute XtErrorMsg ( ) if a NULL value is returned . Xt error handlers are not supposed to return so this effectively exits . In addition , if XtRealloc ( ) is called with a NULL pointer , it uses XtMalloc ( ) to get the initial space . This allows code like : if ( ! ptr ) ptr = ( type * ) malloc ( sizeof ( type ) ) ; else ptr = ( type * ) realloc ( ptr , sizeof ( type ) * ( count + 1 ) ) ; ++count ; to be written as : ptr = XtRealloc ( ptr , sizeof ( ptr ) * ++count ) ; Also , XtFree ( ) accepts a NULL pointer as an argument . Generally , I've found the Xt functions conveniant to use . However , anytime I'm allocating anything potentially large I use the standard functions so I can fully recover from not enough memory errors . XtNew ( ) and XtNewString ( ) are conveniant macros for allocating a structure or copying a string : struct abc *xyzzy ; char *ptr ; char *str = `` abcdef '' ; xyzzy = XtNew ( struct abc ) ; /* takes care of type casting */ ptr = XtNewString ( str ) ; A strict interpretation of the Intrinsics reference manual allow an implementation to provide functions that are not exchangable with malloc ( ) and free ( ) . I.e . code such as : char *ptr ; ptr = XtMalloc ( 100 ) ; /* ... */ free ( ptr ) ; may not work . Personally , I 'd call any implementation that did this broken and complain to the vendor . A common error for Motif programmers is to use XtFree ( ) on a string when they should really be using XmStringFree ( ) . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 25 . How to debug an Xt application ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- First , I 'd recomend getting `` purify '' from Pure Software . This is a great package for tracing memory problems on Sun 's . It 's a bit pricey at $ 2750 but I 'd still recomend it . Excuse the marketing blurb ( contact support @ pure.com for more info ) . Purify inserts additional checking instructions directly into the object code produced by existing compilers . These instructions check every memory read and write performed by the program under test and detect several types of access errors , such as reading unitialized memory , writing past malloc 'd bounds , or writing to freed memory . Purify inserts checking logic into all of the code in a program , including third party and vendor object-code libraries , and verifies system call interfaces . In addition , Purify tracks memory usage and identifies individual memory leaks using a novel adaption of garbage collection techniques . Purify 's nearly comprehensive memory access checking slows the target program down typically by a factor of two to five . An alternative package that is n't as pricey ( $ 395 for a Sun ) , runs on many Unix 's and has pretty similar features is `` The SENTINEL Debugging Environment '' . This replaces malloc ( ) and several other C library functions to add additional checks . ( contact cpcahil @ virtech.vti.com for more info ) Next , if you are getting any sort of Xlib error , you 'll need to run in synchronous mode , easily accomplished with the `` -sync '' command line argument or by setting the variable Xdebug to 1 with your debugger . Then set a break point in exit ( ) . This will let you trace back to the original Xlib function being called . If you do n't run in synchronous mode , then the actual error may have occured any number of calls to Xlib previously since the Xlib calls are buffered and replies from the server are asynchronous . Next , if you are having trouble with window layout , you can use the undocumented resource `` xtIdentifyWindows '' or the class resource '' XtDebug '' to cause the widget name to be identified with each window . For example : example % xload -xrm '*XtDebug : true ' & example % xwininfo -tree < click in new xload window > will give the normal information but the widget name and class of each window is included . This can help for checking the location and size of errant widgets . Next , if you are having trouble with geometry managers or you want to test the way a widget manages it 's children , you can try export.lcs.mit.edu : contrib/libXtGeo.tar.Z . This acts as a filter between any children and a geometry manager and checks the behaviour of both . It 's a very clever idea . The most unfortunate problem is debugging a callback while the application is executing a grab of the keyboard or mouse ( such as from a pulldown menu ) . The server effectively locks up and you 'll need to go to another machine and kill the debugger manually . The server locks up because the application being debugged has said no one else can have access to the keyboard but the application is not stopped waiting because the debugger is waiting for your commands . Unfortunately you ca n't give them because all the input is going to your application which is stopped . The best way to debug this kind of problem is with two machines on your desk , running the program under a debugger ( or other environment ) on one machine , and running the application on the other , possibly using a command sequence like this : othermachine % xhost +thismachine thismachine % setenv DISPLAY othermachine:0 ; thismachine % gdb application # Your favorite debugger . or this : othermachine % xhost +thismachine thismachine % gdb application ( gdb ) set environment DISPLAY othermachine:0 ( gdb ) run ... I believe CodeCenter , a C interpreter/graphical debugger has a method of dealing with this by explicitely calling the Xlib functions to release any grabs during breakpoints . Debugging widget problems requires pretty good debugging skills and knowledge of how widgets work . You can go a long way without knowing the internals of a particular widget but not very far without understanding how a widget works . Judicious use of conditional breakpoints and adding print statements with the debugger help a great deal . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 26 .

The problem I have is that when I use them in my application they seem not to be registred properly . I have made a handy little testprogram where everything works perfect , but in my `` real '' application nothing happens . The introduction in R3 of the XtApp* ( ) functions obsoleted those routines ( see Q19 for other changes in R3 , R4 , and R5 ) . What happens is they use a default application context different then the one you may have created . Since events and timeouts are distributed on a per application context basis and you are using two application contexts , you wo n't get those events . For example : ... cnt = 0 ; toplevel = XtAppInitialize ( & app , class , Desc , XtNumber ( Desc ) , & argc , argv , Fallback , args , cnt ) ; XtAddTimeOut ( ... ) XtAddWorkProc ( ... ) XtAppMainLoop ( app ) would never invoke the timeout . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 27 .

Motif Version 1.2 supports drag-n-drop capabilities , OpenLook has supported d-n-d all along . The two protocols are not compatable with each other , and so far as I know , they are not published . I wrote a package called RDD which is designed to be a flexible public protocol for doing drag ' n drop operations between clients . My intention was to provide a tool which would make it easy for people to support a `` standard '' drag-n-drop protocol in the programs they develop and contribute or sell , regardless of what widget set is used ( as long as it is based on Xt ) . The implementation is based upon my understanding of the ICCCM conventions , for more details read the code . I have heard from dozens of people using RDD who like it and feel that it works a whole lot better than Motif 1.2 stuff . Also , there seem to be many who think that it is neat but are constrained to use Motif anyway . The latest RDD ( and some other stuff ) is available for ftp from netcom.com , in /pub/rogerr .

Catcher Hundley 's grounder to the drawn-in Branson failed to bring Thompson in , then the play of the game occured : Saberhagen was due up , so Reds pitching coach Larry Rothschild met with the infield to discuss the possibility of a suicide squeeze . They called it perfectly : Thompson was hung out to dry after Pugh 's first-pitch pitch out and the threat ended . ( Is n't the NATIONAL LEAGUE great ? ? ) The Reds picked up 2 runs in the seventh to knot up the game . After Barry Larkin's ground out , Mitchell , Chris Sabo , and Randy Milligan got back-to-back-to-back singles -- the third scoring Mitchell . Reggie Sanders then plated Sabo with a long fly to center . A double by Oliver might have scored runner Dan Wilson , but third base coach Dave Bristol threw up the stop sign too late -- Wilson himself was hung out to dry killing the Reds rally . Rob Dibble came on in the ninth and pitched shakily . With two outs and a runner on second Bonilla came to the plate and all I could think of was the Sunday game in late August last year when Bonilla 's three-run dinger slapped a loss on Dibble and spelled the beginning of the end for Cinci 's season . Bonilla ended up walking , and HoJo flied out to left to give the Reds their first win in a week , and earned Dibble his third save in as many opportunities . The win went to Steve Foster ( 1-2 ) who got in what must be an ego-boosting two perfect innings work , striking out three . Saberhagen ( 2-1 ) got the loss -- though I 'm a bit surprised he even pitched in the eighth . I 'll take it , though . The Reds are now 3-9 , still the worst team in baseball with the Royals victory today . The Mets are 6-5 .

The basic problem with your argument is your total and complete reliance on the biblical text . Luke 's account is highly suspect ( I would refer you to the hermeneia commentary on Acts ) . Moreover Luke 's account is written at least 90 years after the fact . In the meantime everyone he mentions has died and attempts to find actual written sources behind the text have come up with only the we section of the later portion of acts as firmly established . Moreover , Pauls account of some of the events in Acts ( as recorded in Galatians ) fail to establish the acts accounts . What we need , therefore , is a reliable text , critically appreciated , which documents the death of Christians for belief in the Resurrection . I would suggest you look at some greek and roman historians . I think you will be disapointed . randy

I tend to agree that players are not hurt by early play in the big leagues . The BRaves organization is a fertile ground to test this hypothesis , as they had little talent on their roster for some time . Steve Avery , for example , was rushed to the majors , and he fared very poorly during his initial campaign . His subsequent pitching has not been affected by his 5+ ERA during his rookie year . Bill James pointed out that it was relatively unusual to struggle so and then rebound . Bob Horner was also rushed to the majors ( out of Arizona State directly ) had good numbers immediately . I am not certain of the ages of people like Pete Smith , Craig McMurty , and Derek Lilliquist . The Braves pitching staffs were so bad when they came up that they might have been rushed . Lilliquist and Smith struggled , but it did n't hurt PS and DL may have been overhyped . I seem to recall CM pitching well initially , though I do n't have stats handy .

EDT Q For everyone listening on KDKA Radio , I 'm Mike Whitely , KDKA Radio News . We 're here at the Pittsburgh International Airport and with me is the President of the United States Bill Clinton . And I 'd like to welcome you to the area and to KDKA . THE PRESIDENT : Thank you , Mike . Glad to be here . Q There are a lot of things we 'd like to talk about in the brief amount of time we have , but some news is just breaking from Los Angeles . I guess the entire country has been kind of holding their breath , wondering what 's going to happen in the trial of the four Los Angeles police officers . We just heard that two of those officers , the sergeant , Sergeant Koon and Officer Powell have been found guilty , and two officers have been found not guilty . It 's a situation that 's been building for over a year since the first trial and now this trial and this verdict . And I wonder what your thoughts are this morning on how you see the situation in Los Angeles in connection with your administration and what you 're trying to do . THE PRESIDENT : Well , first of all , I think the American people should know that this trial , in my judgment , is a tribute to the work and judgment of the jury , as well as to the efforts of the federal government in developing the case . The law under which the officers were tried is a complex one ; the standards of proof are complicated . The jury decided that they would convict the sergeant who was responsible for supervising the officers and the officer who on the film did most of the beating . The jury acquitted an officer who kicked Rodney King , but also plainly tried to shield him from some blows , and another officer who was a rookie . No one knows exactly why they did what they did , but it appears that they really tried to do justice here . They acknowledged that his civil rights were violated . And I think that the American people should take a lot of pride in that . But I hope now we can begin to look ahead and focus on three things : first of all , the importance of trying to bring this country together and not violate the civil rights of any American ; secondly , the importance of renewing our fight against crime . I think it 's important to recognize that in the poorest areas of Los Angeles and many other cities in this country , people may be worried about police abuse , but they 're even more worried about crime . It 's time that we renewed our efforts to go to community policing -- put 100,000 more police officers on the street ; pass the Brady Bill that would require a waiting period before people could buy a handgun , and do some other things to reduce the vulnerability of our people to violence and drugs . And the last point I 'd like to make is it seems to me that we have got to rededicate ourselves to the economic revitalization of our cities and other economically-distressed areas . If you just think about it -- if everybody in Los Angeles who wanted a job had one , I do n't think we 'd have quite as many problems as we do . And I laid out a very ambitious program in the campaign to try to bring private investment and public investment to bear in our cities . I have dispatched the Commerce Secretary , Ron Brown , to California to try to come up with some strategies for that state , because it 's our biggest state with our highest unemployment rate -- which could then be applied around the country . I want to talk to him and to the Attorney General , to the new head of the NAACP , to Reverend Jackson , and to several other people , and then I 'll decide where to go from here with regard to Los Angeles and the other cities of the country . Q Let 's talk about what brings you to the Pittsburgh area today . There have been -- I guess there 's been a lot of discussion on Capitol Hill about your stimulus package . You 've been locked in a battle with the GOP . Yesterday , as you said earlier in your radio address , you made some moves to break that gridlock . What brings you to Pittsburgh , in particular to Allegheny County , in particular to Pennsylvania , with that battle ? THE PRESIDENT : Well , there are two reasons . First of all , Pittsburgh , Allegheny County and Pennsylvania supported me in the last election because they wanted a new direction in economic policy . We have passed our overall economic plan ; it gives the country a very different budget for the next five years than we 've had in the previous 12 . We reduced the deficit and , at the same time , increased investment in jobs and education and health care , in the things that will make us a stronger country . But in addition to that , I asked the Congress in the short run to spend a little more money , a modest amount of money to create another half-million jobs in the next year and a half ; to try to cut the unemployment rate by a half a percent ; but also to try to spark job creation in the private sector more . The plan passed the House . It has the support of a majority of the Senate . At the present time , all the Republican senators as a bloc are filibustering the bill . That is , they wo n't let it come to a vote . I believe that Senator Specter would like to vote for the bill . And I believe that Senator Dole , the Republican leader , has put a lot of pressure on a lot of the Republicans to stay hitched . And they 're all saying that this bill increases the deficit . It does n't . This bill is well below the spending targets that Congress approved , including the Republicans , for this year . This bill is paid for by budget cuts in the next five years . This bill is designed to give a jump-start to the economy . And I must say , a lot of the Republican senators that are holding it up , when Mr. Bush was President , voted for billions of dollars of emergency spending of just this kind -- much of it was totally unrelated to creating jobs . So what I 'm trying to do is to break this logjam . I 've held out an olive branch , I 've offered a compromise . But I think that we ought to try to put some more Americans to work right now to show that we 're changing the direction of the country . And that 's the purpose of the bill . Q Have you been in touch with Senator Specter or his office lately ? THE PRESIDENT : Well , we 've been trying to talk regularly to -- through my White House Congressional Liaison operation to the senators that we think are open to this -- Senator Specter , Senator D'Amato from New York , Senator Jeffords from Vermont , Senator Hatfield from Oregon , and five or six others whom we believe know we need more jobs in this economy and know that we are paying for this with budget cuts over the life of the budget I presented . You know , it has a lot of appeal to say , well , we 've got a big deficit , we should n't increase it more . But the truth is that we are paying for this with budget cuts in the whole life of the budget over the next few years . And more importantly , we have this program well below the spending targets that Congress has already approved for this year . And they 've done this for years , with the Republicans voting for it -- many Republicans voting for it -- for things that were n't nearly as important as putting the American people back to work . So I just hope that this does n't become a political issue . It ought to just be about the people of this country and the need for jobs . Q I have some questions from people who supported you , and some people who are skeptical about your administration . It has to do with their hopes , and also with their fears . A lot of people who supported you and voted for you in Pennsylvania -- I think some of them are now saying , we 're glad we got him in the White House , but now look at this incredible process he has to go through . Look at these problems . Look at this gridlock . And they 're beginning to wonder , is this going to work ; can you pull it off ? And , of course , your skeptics are saying , well , I knew it was going to be like this . THE PRESIDENT : Well , what I would -- I 'd ask people , first of all , to remember that we are , frankly , moving very fast . The budget resolution that the Congress passed is the fastest they have ever passed a budget resolution -- ever -- in history , setting out the next five-year budget targets . So we are moving really rapidly . And we 've got them working on political reform , welfare reform , health care reform , a whole wide range of things . But it 's a big operation . You ca n't expect to turn it around overnight . It took 12 years to produce the conditions which led to the victory I received from the people in November , and we ca n't turn it around in 90 days . But I think we 're making real , real progress . I would urge the people not to get discouraged . We 're not going to win every battle , and not everything is going to happen overnight . But we are definitely moving and changing things . Q Thank you very much . The President of the United States , Bill Clinton , here live at Pittsburgh International Airport . I 'm Mike Whitely , KDKA News . END10:31 A.M. EDT

Ville Siren 's slap shot from the blue line on power play made it 1-1 , and Juha Riihijarvi scored a nice goal in another power play when he close in front of goal put the puck high over Aslin , 1-2 after the first period . The Finns started the second period with really good pressure . Korpisalo made it 1-3 with another goal from close range high over Aslin . Then , during the Finnish pressure , Sweden turned the game around in 1:47 . Mikael Renberg worked hard behind the Finnish goal , and passed the puck to Jan Larsson in front , who backhanded the puck low , 2-3 . Rundqvist entered the Finnish zone and passed to Ahlund , and the Finnish defense let Ahlund skate in and take a shot that Ketterer dropped into the goal , 3-3 . Next , Roger Hansson -behind the goal- sent the puck back to the blue line where Roger Akerstrom took a slap shot and Ketterer did n't see the puck since there was traffic in front , 4-3 . Third period started with a nice goal by Stefan `` the Shadow '' Nilsson . Stefan and Patrik Juhlin entered the Finnish zone , Patrik passed the puck back to Stefan who alone with Ketterer made no mistake , 5-3 . Then , Keijo Sailynoja show started . He reduce and equalized the lead in only 21 seconds ! First he scored the 5-4 goal , and after that he came in alone with Aslin but was tripped by Aslin to get a penalty shot . Sailynoja made a nice penalty shot , showed forehand and put in with a low backhand shot . The Swedes seemed to head for a win when Mikael Renberg scored the 6-5 goal late in the game on a nice power play combination . Renberg waited in the slot , showed that he wanted the puck on the backhand side , Ahlund passed the puck and Renberg took a turnaround shot low in Ketterer 's goal 's far side . But Jari Korpisalo had other plans as he only 28 seconds later scored the game 's final goal to make it 6-6 . Korpisalo took a slap shot from a narrow angle that -maybe- Aslin should have saved . All in all , a decent game where the defense was n't the best . Both teams juggled around the lines a bit in the second and third period to try no combinations . Renberg and Rundqvist plays well together in the Swedish team . Larsson- Nilsson-Juhlin best line overall again , it seems to be a working WC line . Stillman good on defense . Some players are n't good enough for the WC though . Hakan Ahlund ( faell ner hjaelmen och jobba ! ) , Roger Hansson , Challe Berglund , Kenny Jonsson will likely have to leave for NHL pros . Two-goal scorers Jari Korpisalo and Keijo Sailynoja played well in the Finnish team . Markus Ketterer did n't have a very good game , we 've seen him a lot better , so Lindfors is probably Finland 's starting goalie in the WC . I heard that Esa Tikkanen will join the Finnish team .

If supernatural beings exist , it is > = as appropriate to ask why they do so as it is to ask why we exist . I beg to disagree with the assertion that science is a collection of models . Scientific models are a game to play , and are only as good as the assumptions and measurements ( if any ) that go into them . As an example , I remember when nuclear winter was the big hype in atmospheric science . It was n't long after Sagan 's admonitions that one of our boys was adding another level of reality into his model of the nuclear winter scenario at ERL in Boulder . He decided to assume that the atmosphere is more like a two-dimensional thing , than a one- dimensional thing . He also assumed that it rained and that the winds blow in the real atmosphere . On returning to Georgia Tech , he showed a transparency of atmospheric cooling rates according to the year they were generated by the models . There was an unmistakable correlation between the age ( meaning simplicity of assumptions ; i.e. , remoteness from reality ) of each model and the degree of cooling . Whereas Sagan's model showed an approximate 40-degree cooling episode , the next model in sophistication showed about half that , and so on until we got to our boy 's model , which showed a 1-2 degree drop if the war happened in the winter and less than a 10 degree drop if it happened in the summer . He predicted that when we would include the presence of oceans , chemistry , the biosphere , and other indicators of reality in the models , we would probably see even less cooling . Thus nuclear winter was reduced to even less than a nuclear autumn , one might say , to a nuclear fizzle . To quote from H.S . Yoder , The postulated models have become accepted as the reality instead of the lattice of assumptions they are . Authoritarianism dominates the field , and a very critical analysis of each argument is to be encouraged ... . Skepticism of the model approach to earth problems is warranted because many key parameters have not been included . This statement surely applies equally well to cosmogony . Only when convincing observational evidence substantiates the modeled results may one suggest that the model may describe the reality . Just thought I 'd clear that up before things really got out of hand . -- boundary no teneis que pensar que yo haya venido a traer la paz a la tierra ; no he venido a traer la paz , sino la guerra ( Mateo 10:34 , Vulgata Latina )

EDT SECRETARY RILEY : Good evening and welcome to all of you in the thousands of communities around the country that are taking part in this satellite town meeting for the month of April . You know , today is April 13th . In 1743 , Thomas Jefferson was born , 250 years ago . I think that 's appropriate to mention at the beginning of this meeting because since that time he has been , of course , a person who has been one that we 've all followed in terms of our democracy and the importance of education here in this great country . The success of our democracy according to Jefferson really depends upon the success of our educational system . His philosophy of government , his belief in the importance of education is also very meaningful to our special guest here this evening . Tonight we 're so pleased to have with us President Clinton . He 's come over from the White House to join us in the Chamber of Commerce studios . Mr. President , it 's good to have you . We thank you for taking the time to visit with these communities here on the satellite network and we welcome you here this evening . Also we have with us Secretary of Labor Robert Reich . And , Bob , it 's certainly pleasant to have you with us this evening also . I have some questions for our two guests , and I 'm sure many of you do , too . So please call us if there 's something that you 'd like to ask . The number is 1/800/368-5781 or 5782 . In Washington , D.C. the number is 202/463-3170 or 3171 . I believe the President has a few words that he might want to share with us . And , Mr. President , I 'll ask you to do that at this time . It 's great to have you . THE PRESIDENT : Thank you very much , Mr. Secretary . I 'm glad to be here with my friends , Dick Riley and Bob Reich -- also members of my Cabinet -- at the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce to support the effort that the Chamber is making , along with its Center for Work Force Preparation , to help to examine tonight the whole critical question of how to move our young people from school to the work place . I want to compliment the Chamber on all their efforts , recognizing that without an educated work force we ca n't grow this economy or remain competitive , and recognizing that we all have to work together -- business and government , labor and educators -- to make things happen . This satellite town meeting is a good example of that kind of working together . And if you 'll forgive me a little home state pride , I want to say a special word of thanks to the Wal-Mart Corporation , headquartered in Bentonville , Arkansas , for providing several hundred of the sites for this town meeting tonight . I appreciate that a lot , as well as the sites that are provided for all the rest of you . I have tried as hard as I could to move toward constructive change for this country . Secretary Riley talked about this being Thomas Jefferson 's 250th birthday . If Thomas Jefferson believed in anything , he believed in these three things : first , in education ; second , in real personal liberty , freedom of religion , freedom of speech , freedom of association , freedom of the press ; and third , in the absolute imperative of changing as times change . If you go to the Jefferson Memorial here in this beautiful city , which is now bedecked with all of its wonderful cherry blossoms , you will see Jefferson saying that we have to change with changing times . For us here in America , that means reducing our deficit and increasing our investment and putting our people first so that we can compete in the world . We 're here to talk about that tonight -- about what we can do to educate and train our people better . Unless we do that , none of the efforts that all the rest of us make in government , even to bring the budget into balance , even to increase our investment in other things which will grow jobs , will last in the long run . We also have to have people who can carry their load . And in a world where the average young person will change jobs seven or eight times in a lifetime , that begins with the education system and continues into the work force where education must go on for a lifetime . It 's not just important what you know , but what you can learn . And if I might , I 'd like to close just by emphasizing we 're doing our best to try to have the most innovative partnership between the Labor Department and the Education Department and the private sector to build a good school-to-work transition . And we 're trying to get off to a good start this summer with a program that would create more than 700,000 new summer jobs , including many thousands that have a strong education component so our young people can be learning and working at the same time . Dick , I think I ought to stop there . That 's a good place we can begin , I think , the discussion . SECRETARY RILEY : Thank you so much , Mr. President . Each month we get together and talk about ways that all citizens can work towards reaching the national education goals . And tonight , we 'll focus on goal five , and how communities such as yours can prepare students for this world of work . This week , the Education Department and the Labor Department are hosting a conference here in Washington , D.C. called Summer Challenge , a program of work and learning , to America 's youth . The aim is to use some special funds from President Clinton 's proposed economic stimulus package to provide educationally-enriched jobs and summer school programs for young people in disadvantaged areas of the country . Mr. President , let 's talk a minute -- you alluded to it somewhat -- about the Summer Youth Challenge . Your program calls for more educational enrichment in the summer jobs . And why in your words is that so important ? THE PRESIDENT : I think it 's important for two reasons . First of all , a lot of the young people we 're trying to reach may have had trouble adjusting to school and learning . And while we want them to have a good experience with a real job , we also want them to continue to learn during the summer because we know from a lot of research that a lot of kids that have trouble learning in school may forget as much as 30 percent of what they learned the previous year over the summertime . And that is a very unproductive thing for schools to have to take up a lot of time teaching what they already taught before . Secondly , we want to help these young people progress , not only in terms of work , but in terms of learning . We want to abolish the artificial dividing line between what is work and what is learning because we think that the best and most productive workers will have to be lifetime learners . And we think that this experience could maybe drive that point home and prepare these young people to succeed in school , or at work , or in college as they go on . SECRETARY RILEY : Well , I think the fact that these are disadvantaged kids -- that gap , that lag you mentioned as they go into the next year , is really even greater . Secretary Reich , of course , you have training programs throughout the year . And I wonder is you have any comment about this educational component of training . SECRETARY REICH : Well , what we 've learned , Mr. Secretary , is that for many young people , whether it 's for the summer or for the year , actually on-the-job work experience combined with education is one of the best ways of learning . Many young people , for example , have a lot -- they have a difficult time learning geometry . But when they actually are there building something or working on something , and they can see the exact and direct application of geometry , they understand what it 's used for . And a lot of young people -- just that sense of connection between education and the world of work is terribly , terribly important . It 's important during the summer , but it 's important for a lot of young people even beyond the summer . SECRETARY RILEY : Thank you . Mr. President , you 've called for a youth apprenticeship program , school-to-work transition . And I wonder if you would tell us a little bit about your concept of that and how you see it developing . THE PRESIDENT : Well , first of all , let 's talk about why it 's important . Most new jobs that will be created in this decade will not require a four-year college degree , but most of them will require some learning and skills that go well beyond what most people get in a high school diploma . If you look at the last 10 years , the average salaries of young people that had at least two years of good post-high school education was a good salary that went up over the decade . The young people who had less than that tended to have lower wages that did not go up , and in many cases in real terms fell over the decade , because they were n't productive , they were n't more valuable to their employers . So we think America has a big economic interest in trying to ensure that all the young people who get out of high school but do n't go on to college make a transition to work , which includes two years of further training either in a community college , a vocational setting , or perhaps on the job . And what I have done in this budget , as you know , is to give you and Secretary Reich some funds and some incentives to try to work in partnership with states and with the private sector to build these programs state-by-state in a way that would be customized essentially by the business community , based on the needs of the economy in any given area . It could revolutionize long-term the quality of the American work force and the earnings of American workers . SECRETARY REICH : I should add , Mr. President -- I think you know this from your experience in Arkansas -- and many of the people watching this program -- that the business community and educators , labor groups are already in many of our communities , many of our states , building a school-to-work transition program . In fact , there 's an awful lot of ferment , a lot of excitement . The people watching this program probably are the ones who are most directly involved in that . And more power to them . Secretary Riley and I are going to do everything we can to build on the successes already out there . SECRETARY RILEY : Bob , we 're going to be talking tonight about youth apprenticeship and tech prep , the co-op learning career academies . And what features all those programs that deal with this subject -- what are some of the features that every one of these school-to-work programs might have that are important ? SECRETARY REICH : Well , one thing that we 've seen -- and you and I have been working at this for a long time , and you much longer than I -- we 've seen that active involvement of the business community is absolutely essential . And I 'm so delighted that we 're doing this in the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce . The Chamber of Commerce of the United States is committed to doing these kinds of programs -- training , education , retraining -- and we 've aimed to work very closely with the Chamber . The business community is going to be actively engaged in developing almost an audit of the kind of jobs that are needed and helping the educators , community colleges , technical institutions develop curricula that are relevant for the jobs of the future . Communities have got to come together . I mean , this is one of the most important things . You 've got to have all of these players in a community come together and work together and cooperate together . You know , too often we have the educators over here and the business leaders over here , labor groups over here and everybody is talking , but they 're not really working together in a common strategy . And the third and final ingredient I would say , Dick , would be a commitment to excellence -- a commitment both to academic excellence and also to skills development excellence . This is not a tracking program we 're talking about for kids who are not going to make it . This is a program that every young person ought to be eligible for . If they want to go on beyond that to four-year college , that 's fine . That ought to be permissible . But we 're talking about the foundation of learning about jobs , the foundation skills for on-the-job learning . And again , those are the critical components . It 's already being done . THE PRESIDENT : I think -- if I might just interject one point based on my personal experience at home -- the business community has a critical role to play , not simply in saying here are the job skills that are needed and here 's what ought to be taught , but also in monitoring that excellence . If you have the right sort of partnership there , the people who are paying the taxes and who are going to then be hiring the workers are not going to permit the second-rate programs to survive if they have any way to shape and influence them . So I think that 's very important . And when we try to , if you will , fill in the blanks at the federal level , trying to set some standards and provide some funds , one of the things that we want to be sure and do is to make sure that the employer has a heavy amount of influence over the quality of these programs , because that 's really what 's going to determine whether the whole thing is worthwhile . SECRETARY RILEY : That 's great . We 've been talking , of course , about school-to-work and also the jobs and economic recovery program for this summer and fall . But let 's talk just a moment about long-term school reform . It 's something especially close to me . Mr. President , I wonder if you would give us some of your ideas for the communities out here on Goals 2000 legislation that I think will be coming forth before too long . THE PRESIDENT : Well , as you know , back when you and I were both governors , we spent a lot of time working on our public schools and we tried to be very candid with our people in saying that a lot of these things were going to take some time to materialize . I had a hand in writing the National Education Goals that the governors drafted , along with representatives of President Bush 's administration back in 1989 . And what we 're going to try to do this year with your leadership is to introduce legislation in Congress that will actually define the things that the national government ought to do to try to help the local schools and the children of this country and the adult learners , too , meet those goals -- making sure that when -- by 2000 , people show up for school ready to learn ; that we get a 90 percent on-time high school graduation rate ; that children at the 4th , 8th , and 12th grades are confident in the subjects they 're supposed to know ; that they are second to none in math and science ; that are schools are safe , disciplined , and drug-free . And , of course , the fifth goal -- I took them out of line to say this the last -- is that we have a system of life-long learning in this country . And each one of those goals there 's a national role , a state role , a school role , school district role , and a private sector role . And what you 've attempted to do in this bill you 're going to introduce with me in the next few weeks is to define what our job is ; and then to give the rest of America a way of defining what their job is and seeing whether we 're actually meeting the standards of quality that we need to meet . It 's very exciting . So far as I know , nothing quite like it has ever been done in the form of federal legislation before . Not mandating and telling people what they have to do with their money , but actually setting up a framework for excellence and partnerships so that we can do our job . I 'm really excited about it . SECRETARY RILEY : Well , I am , too . And I think really it will be an entirely new role for the federal government in terms of its relationship with states , serving as a partner really to support and facilitate and to help out in these education reform efforts , all driven by high standards . That 's the point . Bob , let me ask you one question , and then we 'll get to the telephone calls . It 's about the same subject . We have , of course , skills standards that are going to be part of Goals 2000 , and I wonder if you would comment on that . SECRETARY REICH : Well , you know , we have 75 percent of our young people who do n't graduate from college . Very often they do n't have very many alternatives . They do have a wonderful system of community colleges and technical institutions , but if we had national skill standards to which they could aspire and which employers would understand as a national credential , many of these young people would actually find that they were much more eligible for jobs . Everybody does n't have to go to college . Other countries you have smaller proportions of their population going to college , but you have a whole level of people who have certain technical , preprofessional skills . We can do it in this country . If you do n't go to four-year college you 're not a loser . And we want to develop those national skill standards . We 're going to be working with the states , with the Education Department , with a lot of private industry in developing those standards . And I think they will be the kinds of things that enable our vocational and technical and other institutions to rally around , as well as our business community . SECRETARY RILEY : Well , that 's great . Why do n't we go ahead and go to the telephone . We have a call , I see -- Mayor Bruce Todd of Austin , Texas . Q Yes , Mr. President and Mr. Secretary Reich and Riley , we certainly appreciate the opportunity to join you today . We have some dedicated professionals and volunteers here in Austin who have heard what you have said and are very appreciative . Let me simply say , amen to some of the comments made already . We agree with much of the tone that the Clinton administration has taken , and are very supportive . We have been successful here in Austin of tripling our summer employment program over the last four years . We expect to have over 2,000 employed this year in the summertime ; perhaps as much as 3,500 with the federal assistance . Much of the question that we had designed you have answered in your opening comments , so we must be thinking alike . But the question essentially involved what initiatives after Labor Day would be appropriate . We know summertime is important . Year-round is even more important . And what kind of initiatives at the federal level might be proposed to meet the needs of the youth on a year- round basis ? And perhaps more importantly , how can families and the local community be more involved using the federal initiative ? That 's something that we believe is very important to success in this effort . SECRETARY RILEY : Mr. President . THE PRESIDENT : I think I 'll give everybody a chance to answer the question , Bruce , but let me first thank you for calling , and thank you for all the great work that you 're doing in Austin . I 've seen some of it and I 've always been very impressed . First , with regard to the summer program , we hope we can structure it in a way that will enable us to continue the summer program and that will move a lot of these young people back into schools under circumstances that might allow them to do some work in the private sector , too . We hope that -- Secretary Reich is going to try to set up a system where we create a lot of private sector jobs to be matched with the public sector jobs this summer . And we 're working on that . Secondly , in the program that I have presented to the Congress over the next five years , what we are attempting to do is to build in an amount of investment that 's quite substantial for job training programs , for school-to-work programs , all of which give heavy , heavy weight to local community input -- just the question you asked -- but do provide some federal investment dollars , which we hope you can put with local dollars to keep people working and being trained on a year-round basis . And I will say again , to echo what Secretary Reich said a moment ago , to try to break down the barrier between what is seen as work and what is seen as learning . An awful lot of young people actually have quite high IQs , but actually learn so much better when they 're doing than when they 're reading or just listening . So we hope that the community involvement part of it will be permanent , and we hope that if the whole budget passes -- and we do have 200 budget cuts and more than 200 , actually , in the budget -- and some revenue raisers , and some new money for education and training , that we 'll be able to do just what you seem to want based on your question . Bob , do you want to say anything ? SECRETARY REICH : Well , you took most of the words out of my mouth , Mr. President , as usual . But let me just add one thing , and that is that one of the most important aspects of post-high school for a lot of young people who are not going on to college , in addition to the school-to-work program , simply is the availability of jobs . And we 've got to get this economy moving again , obviously . It 's terribly important to get this recovery program , to get the economy back on track . That 's sort of the prerequisite to everything else . If we do n't get the economy back on track -- we have -- I think this is the 16th -- correct me if I 'm wrong , Mr. President -- I think is the 16th month we have had seven percent unemployment or greater . This is a jobless recovery . A lot of those kids are going to be getting out of school in June . And even if we did everything right , they would have a very , very hard time getting jobs . SECRETARY RILEY : Thank you both . Of course , Goals 2000 will be a permanent , long-term thing that will certainly reach into next year . It will involve , if passed -- and we certainly hope it will be -- action plans with every state where we can be working together to reach for the goals in a number of different ways . And then the state , with all the various school districts , a very important part of that will be citizen and parent involvement . And I think everybody will see a great energy out there , once we get that moving . The next call is Dr. Harry Heinemann , New York . Doctor ? Q Good evening , Mr. Secretary . It is a pleasure to be on with you this evening . As you may know , bridging the school and work has been central to La Guardia 's educational program since its inception in the 1970s , and that includes the college , the two alternative high schools that operate on our campus , and the linkages we have forged with the local schools . We have found this to be an extremely effective learning strategy . And over the years , we 've come to believe that there are several principles that are very important in bridging the school and work . And these include integrating theory in the classroom with practice in the workplace , with providing all students early exposure to careers , as well as providing opportunities for them to reflect upon these experiences while they strengthen their skills ; and lastly , the critical role of the liberal arts , particularly in the development of high performance competencies . My question , then is : How can the general education faculty and the academic curriculum be more closely integrated with transition to work experience ? And what mechanisms and strategies can you suggest to achieve this integration ? SECRETARY RILEY : Well , thank you very much . I think -- and we 'll get a response from you all on that , and very interesting work going on there . We 're going to have three people , our next guests on the program this evening , that will be some specialists in that area that you 're speaking , and I 'll certainly pass that on to them and we can discuss it later . You all care to comment -- any comments you might have ? THE PRESIDENT : I 'd just like to say , if I might , one thing . I want to reemphasize this and I do n't think I 'm being as clear about it as I 'd like , although I think at least one of the people who will be on the second panel will be able to say it more explicitly than I. I think this whole concept of applied academics is very important . And I think that we have to basically abolish what I consider to be a very artificial distinction between what is vocational learning and what is academic learning . I think we should keep the liberal arts going . I think we should have a strong component for people who are in the vocational program . SECRETARY REICH : It seems to me that we also need to rethink our entire tracking system , because a lot of these school and work combinations are important for mainstream students . They 're important for all students . It 's not just a special group of students that needs them . Some of the experiments that I 've seen around the United States -- Dick , I 'm sure you 've seen them as well -- are mainstream experiments . They 're mainstreaming all the students . At 11th and 12th grades they 're giving them a combined work and school experience and then a transition program . And again , the kids can either go on to college if they want ; they can go on to technical community ; they can go on to an entirely -- a large variety of possibilities and career directions . But we have to get away from the stigmatizing that often goes on with young people who simply are doing job-related or work- related work within the classroom , within our schools . SECRETARY RILEY : Thank you , very much . I think that 's going to be the last call that we have time for . Mr. President , I think you 've got to move on to another matter , and I want to thank you and Secretary Reich for being here . We appreciate your time and your ideas , and it 's been a tremendous help to us . END9:00 P.M. EDT

My experience is that the CD drawer becomes a bit loose , and the CD either skips or ca n't be read . Try seeing if all the screws that hold down the drawer assembly are tightened properly .

These use lateral photoeffect detectors [ Lindholm and Oberg , 1974 ; Woltring and Marsolais , 1980 ] to determine the position of a spot of light projected ( using a camera lens ) over its surface . In escence , the detector is a large photodiode with four cathodes ( one on each of the four sides of the square detector crystal ) and a single anode ( the back of the crystal ) . A spot of light will produce currents which are proportional to the position of the spot on the detector 's face . Let 's try some ASCII graphics in 2-D ( so the detector has two cathodes to detect linear position ) -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - > 1 | | | | |\ -- -- - cathode 1 | | \ XXXXX ________| + \ XXXXX| | \ -- -- -- - light > XXXXX| | \_____ divider __ output XXXXX| | | / -- -- -- - XXXXX| -- -- -| | -- | / | XXXXX| + | | ________| - / 1 + 2 XXXXX| -- - gnd | | / XXXXX| \ / | |/ XXXXX| anode | XXXXX | -- -- - cathode 2 | | | | | -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- > 2 If the dot of light from the LED is the ONLY source of light , then the position of the projection is given by this circuit regardless of the level of illumina- tion ( the divider is used to normalize relative to total received power ) . When this circuit is used in the presence of other sources of light , then the way of '' tuning '' to it is to sample for a few msec the background signal , light the LED for an equal time and sample that signal separately . The difference between the two is the position of the LED . Hamamatsu photonics sells linear and 2-D lateral photoeffect detectors , and they also sell the required signal processing electronics . The ready-made systems by SELSPOT and others are NOT cheap ... Lindholm , L.E. , and K.E . Oberg , `` An Optoelectronic Instrument for Remote On-Line Movement Monitoring '' , Biotelemetry , 1 , 94-95 , 1974 . Woltring , H.J. , and E.B . Marsolais , `` Opto-Electronic ( SELSPOT ) Gait Measure- ments in Two and Three Dimensional Space - A Preliminary Report '' , Bull . Pros- thetics Research , 46-52 , 1980 .

From : vgwlu @ dunsell.calgary.chevron.com ( greg w. luft ) Subject : Relief of Pain Caused by Cancer Organization : chevron Lines : 51 I am not sure if this is the proper group to post this to but here goes anyway . About five years ago my mother was diagnosed with having cancer in the lymph nodes under one of her arms . After the doctors removed the cancerous area she had full movement of her arm with only slight aching under her arm when she moved it . Over the course of the next two years the aching got more severe and her complaining to the doctors produced the explanation that it was scar tissue causing the pain . At this time her doctor suggested that some physiotherapy should be employed to break up the scar tissue . While attending one of her therapy sessions , while her arm was being manipulated , some damage occured ( nerve ? ) which caused the level of pain to permanently increase severly ( controlled by Tylenol 3s ) and some loss of use of the arm ( palsied wrist and almost no outward lateral movement ) . With great persistence on her part the doctors looked further into the issue and discovered that not all of the cancer had been removed and another tumor had grown under the arm . This was removed also but the pain in the arm has not decreased . The doctors are not sure exactly why the pain is persisting but feel some sort of nerve damage has occured and they have employed Tylenol 3 and soon Morphine to relieve the pain . She has tried acupuncture by this only provides minor reductions in pain and is only short term . My questions are : Has anyone has heard of similar cases and what , if anything , was done to reduce the levels of pain ? Are their methods to block nerves so that the pain can be reduced ? Are their methods to restore nerves so that loss of arm function can be restored ? Any general suggestions on pain reduction would be greatly appreciated . Please respond by email because I do not always get chance to read this group . If anyone knows of some literature that may be useful to this case or another newsgroup that I should be posting this to it would also be appreciated . -- Gregory W.

On the one hand there are advantages to having the liturgy stay the same . John has described some of these . On the other hand , some people seem to start tuning out ` the same old words ' and pay attention better when things get changed around . I think innovative priests and liturgy committees are trying to get our attention and make things more meaningful for us . It drives me crazy too . Different people have differing preferences and needs in liturgy . My local parish is innovative . I prefer to go to Mass at the next parish over . Sometimes we do n't have the option of attending a Mass in the style which best suits us . John put a smiley on it but to `` just offer it up '' probably is the solution . A related issue , that it sounds like John does not have to deal with , is that spouses may have different liturgical tastes . My husband does like innovative litury . It is a challenge to meet both of our spiritual needs without just going our separate ways . When you include the factor of also trying to satisfy our children 's needs , things get pretty complicated . One thing to remember is that even the most uncongenial Mass is still Mass .

An analogy someone used a while back can perhaps illustrate it . Say , for example , there are people living on a volcanic island , and a group of geologists determine that a volcano is imminent . They warn the people on the island that they are in danger , and should leave . A group of people on the island is given the task of warning others of the danger . They believe the danger is real , but others may not . Does that mean that the first group are NECESSARILY arrogant in warning others of the danger ? Does it mean that they are saying that their beliefs are correct , and all others are false ? Some might indeed react to opposition with arrogance , and behave in an arrogant manner , but that is a personal idiocyncracy . It does not necessarily mean that they are all arrogant . ============================================================ Steve Hayes , Department of Missiology & Editorial Department Univ . of South Africa , P.O .

From : C445585 @ mizzou1.missouri.edu ( John Kelsey ) Subject : Competing standard Nntp-Posting-Host : mizzou1.missouri.edu Organization : University of Missouri Lines : 22 Perhaps one way of getting away from this cripple chip that the U.S. government seems to be pushing would be to come up with a good alternative . For example , how about a scheme using RSA , and some hybrid of DES-CFB and another strong stream cipher ( Maybe IDEA-CFB ) ? This could be substantially the same as the cripple chip , except that instead of key-registration , the police could demand that you give up your secret key to them ( with a court- issued warrant ) . Then , they could read the last few months of wiretapped messages you 've sent , and assuming you 've committed no crimes , you could generate a new key pair and go about your business . I find that I 'd be willing to pay RSA for the right to use such a system , especially given the alternative . If you were unwilling to give up your secret key , then you'd probably stay in jail ( has anyone got a real legal precedent for this ? ) . This would allow court-issued warrants to be used to gather information on suspected criminals , but it could n't be done in secrecy , and there would be enormously less likelihood of corruption or theft of escrowed keys . ( Maybe someone from the law-enforcement or intelligent community will correct me , but this does n't *seem* like such a big loss in terms of law-enforcement capabilities . ) Any comments ? -- John Kelsey

In my xdm-errors file I had the following entries : > error ( pid 7423 ) : Server for display :0 terminated unexpectedly : > 256 > error ( pid 7927 ) : WARNING : keyboard on display :0 could not be > secured > error ( pid 7423 ) : Server for display :0 terminated unexpectedly : > > I also had : > > error ( pid 7457 ) : WARNING : keyboard on display :0 could not be > secured > error ( pid 7423 ) : Server for display :0 terminated unexpectedly : > 256 > error ( pid 7462 ) : WARNING : keyboard on display :0 could not be > secured > error ( pid 7423 ) : Server for display :0 terminated unexpectedly : > 256 Also , at the console , the login box would come up for about 2 seconds and then it would go away . It would do this continuously . I could login from another workstation to the hosts in question , however , I could not login on the console . I tried killing xdm and restarting it but that did n't help . I finally rebooted all the hosts . ( Which hurts when done in the middle of the day ) . Any help would be appreciated .

The technology of cellular phones will probably be spread spectrum and quite difficult to record the crypttext without the key . If the frequency path depends on they key , as I understand it to , it *could* be made effectively impossible to record . Once it hits land you can record it if you have telco access . The telco is n't supposed to give that without a warrant . That 's the rule today . But even so , the evidence would not be admissible , I think , unless the judge so ordered . I think that even interception of the crypttext without a warrant would be illegal . Cops ca n't record today 's plain cellular calls and then ask a judge , `` Hey , can we have permission to listen to those tapes ? '' can they ? > worse , of course , if the government then uses this `` Clinton Clipper '' > to argue for restrictions on unapproved encryption . ( This is the main > concern of most of us , I think . The camel 's nose in the tent , etc . ) Yes , that is a major concern , but I think that they think they can win just by having 99.5 % of the USA use this system . They do n't even have to care about the cautious .5 % that 's left . They do n't catch the really smart crooks anyway . John Gotti , who would have to be retarded not to realize he was likely to be wiretapped , glibly chatted away on his tapped phone about murder plans . That 's why he 's in jail now . Hard to believe , but true . This scheme can succeed without laws forbidding more , which people would fight a lot harder . They like this enough that they are dropping the so called `` Digital Telephony '' proposal , according to rumours . However the meaning of that is complex , since they still want to get at the crypttext on telco systems , and that requires a bit of work . -- Brad Templeton , ClariNet Communications Corp. -- Sunnyvale , CA 408/296-0366

I would describe myself as an agnostic , in so far as I 'm sure there is no single , universal supreme being , but if there is one and it is just , we will surely be judged on whether we lived good lives , striving to achieve that goodness that is within the power of each of us . Now , the complication is that one of my best friends has become very fundamentalist . That would normally be a non-issue with me , but he feels it is his responsibility to proselytize me ( which I guess it is , according to his faith ) . This is a great strain to our friendship . I would have no problem if the subject did n't come up , but when it does , the discussion quickly begins to offend both of us : he is offended because I call into question his bedrock beliefs ; I am offended by what I feel is a subscription to superstition , rationalized by such circular arguments as 'the Bible is God 's word because He tells us in the Bible that it is so . ' So my question is , how can I convince him that this is a subject better left undiscussed , so we can preserve what is ( in all areas other than religious beliefs ) a great friendship ? How do I convince him that I am 'beyond saving ' so he wo n't try ?

Originator : dmp @ eagle Organization : Citibank IBISM Lines : 34 A friend of mine has been diagnosed with Psoriatic Arthritis , as a result of trauma sustained in a car accident several years ago . The psoriasis is under control but the arthritis part of the illness is not . Ansaid ( non-steroidal anti-inflammatory ) worked pretty well for three years but is n't helping much now . My friend is now taking Meclomen ( another NSAID ) but this is n't helping control the pain at all . In the past two months my friend has also started taking Azulfadine along with the NSAID medicines , but the effects of the combined drugs are n't supposed to be realized for several months . As a result of the pain , my friend is having problems sleeping . Staying in one position too long is an ordeal . Another major contributor to pain is that tendonitis has now developed ( left thumb and hand with numbness at the base of the palm ; bottom of feet ; shoulders and outer thighs ) . The tendonitis is quite painful yet my friend 's doctor has not recommended any form of treatment to relieve it . The latest twist is that the doctor has dropped the anti-inflammatories and is now recommending Prednisone . The hope is that the Prednisone will relieve some of the pain from the tendonitis . My friend is a 41 year old male who feels like he 's 80 ( his words , not mine ) . If anyone is aware of any new treatments for Psoriatic Arthritis , alternative courses of action , support groups or literature on it , I would be extremely grateful if you could e-mail to me .

One solution , sometimes , is to disable `` blind writes '' This does n't sound right to me . Do n't Quadras use the 53C96 ? If so , the Mac has nothing to do with the SCSI timing . That 's all handled by the chip . About the only the timing could be wrong is if Apple programs the clock registers wrong on the 96 . That , however , should only really hurt synchronous transfer , which is not used by the Mac SCSI Manager . Furthermore , disabling blind writes should be meaningless on a Quadra . On Macs that used the 5380 , which is a much lower level SCSI chip , the Mac was responsible for the handshake of each byte transferred . Blind mode affected how the Mac handled that handshake . On the 5396 , the handshake is entirely handled by the chip . -- Tim Smith

A : In the US , currently Virgina and the District of Columbia prohibit all usage of radar detectors . New York prohibits their use in large trucks . In Canada , they are illegal in Manitoba , Ontario , Quebec , Newfoundland and PEI ( Prince Edward Island ) . They are apparently are illegal through most , if not all , of Europe . Legislation which would make them illegal is pending in many other jurisdictions ; chances of such legislation passing varies a great deal . Q : Where are Radar Detector Detectors used ? Do they really work ? A : Usage is spreading rapidly ; initially they were used only in Canada , but now they are appearing in New York and Virginia . It is unsafe to assume that they are not in use in Connecticut and D.C . They work by detecting a certain frequency radiated by many currently available super Het radar detectors ; some brands of detector radiate more strongly than others , and are thus more likely to be spotted . New radar detectors are becoming available which may not be detected by the current generation of detector detectors . Note that a detector may only be spotted by one of these devices if it is turned on . Q : What is VASCAR ? Is it some kind of Radar ? A : VASCAR is nothing more than a fancy stopwatch and time-speed-distance computer . It depends on the operator pressing buttons as the target vehicle passes landmarks . No radar signals are emitted by a VASCAR system . Q : What is Ka band radar ? Where is it used ? Should a radar detector be able to handle it ? A : Ka band has recently been made available by the FCC for use in the US in so-called photo-radar installations . In these installations , a low-powered beam is aimed across the road at a 45 degree angle to the direction of traffic , and a picture is taken of vehicles which the radar unit determines to have been in violation of the speed limit . Tickets are mailed to the owner of the vehicle . Because of the low power and the 45 degree angle , many people believe that a radar detector can not give reasonable warning of a Ka band radar unit , although some manufacturers of radar detectors have added such capability anyway . The number of locales where photo-radar is in use is limited , and some question the legality of such units . Best advice : learn what photo radar units look like , and keep track of where they are used ( or else , do n't speed . ) Q : Do radar jammers work ? Are they legal ? A : Quick answer : No , and Not in the USA . Detailed answer : Cheap radar jammers do not work well at all . Jammers that work are expensive and usually the property of the military . Jammers are a major violation of the regulations of the Federal Communications Commission of the USA . Driving technique and Vehicle Dynamics Questions : Q : What are understeer and oversteer ? A : Understeer and oversteer are terms describing the behaviour of a car while cornering near the ` limit ' ( limit of adhesion , that is . ) Most drivers do not normally drive hard enough for these terms to be descriptive of the situations they encounter . Simply put , they tell whether the car wants to go straight in a corner ( steer ` less ' , or ` understeer ' ) or it wants to turn more in a corner ( ` oversteer ' . ) Understeer is commonly designed into most production cars so that untrained drivers , inadvertantly traveling too fast , wo n't get into trouble . Understeer may also be induced by using too much throttle in a corner . Oversteer is designed into some more performance oriented cars ; it may be induced by lifting on the throttle ( Trailing throttle oversteer , or TTO ) . In extreme cases , lifting on the throttle may induce so much oversteer that the car reacts by fishtailing or spinning . Some technical details : in a corner at speed , the tires on the car will develop what are called ` slip angles ' ; the slip angle is the angular difference between the direction that the car is traveling and the direction that the steering wheel is directing the car to travel . In understeer , the front wheels have a greater slip angle than the rear wheels . In oversteer , the rear wheels have a greater slip angle than the front wheels . Q : What is a rev-matched downshift ? A : When downshifting , the engine must be rotating faster in the lower gear than it was in the higher gear . However , during a downshift , normally you declutch and lift your foot from the throttle , so the revs drop rather than increase . In rev-matched downshift , you blip the throttle before re-engaging the clutch so that the engine will already be up to the new speed . This results in a much smoother and faster downshift . Q : What does heel-and-toe mean ? A : Heel-and-toe is a technique used to do a rev-matched downshift while braking . This is normally challenging , because you need the right foot for both the brake and throttle . It is called heel-and-toe because you use one end of the foot on the brake , and the other on the throttle to match revs for the downshift . In many modern cars this is a misnomer ; often you must use the ball of the foot on the brake and the right side on the throttle . Note that some race car drivers will skip the clutch , and just use the left foot on the brake and the right foot on the throttle , accomplishing the same thing . Q : What is double-clutch downshifting ? A : While your right foot is doing the above , your left foot can do one of three things : nothing , declutch once , or declutch twice . The reason for declutching twice is to match the speeds of the two shafts in the transmission to the speed of the engine . This is usually coupled with rev-matching , so that while the engine is in neutral and the clutch engaged , the throttle is blipped and both shafts of the transmission speed up . The procedure is as follows : ( 0 ) declutch ( 1 ) move gearshift lever to neutral ( 2 ) engage clutch ( 3 ) match revs ( 4 ) declutch ( 5 ) move gearshift lever to next lower gear ( 6 ) engage clutch This sounds like a lot of work , but with practice it becomes natural . The problem that double-clutching solves is normally the function of the synchronizers within the gearbox . In transmissions without synchros or with very worn synchros , double-clutching makes it much easier to shift . Basically , if you double-clutch well , you are not using the synchros at all . This is generally unnecessary on street cars with synchros in good condition . Q : What do the numbers for acceleration from 0-60 , 1/4 mile , skidpad , and slalom times in the Auto Magazines really mean ? May they be compared ? A : In short , 1 ) not as much as the magazines want you to believe , and 2 ) almost never . In more detail : the acceleration numbers ( 0-60mph and 1/4 mile times in the US ) may be vaguely compared as long as they all come from the same source . Testing procedures vary so much from magazine to magazine that comparing a Road & Track number to a Car & Driver number is quite pointless . Keep in mind , too , that the same variation applies from driver to driver on the street ; the driver is a major ( often *the* major ) part of the equation . Skidpads vary , and even if they did n't , skidpad figures are really only tests of the stickiness of the stock tires ; they change radically when tire compounds change . DO NOT make any assumptions about the comparative handling of , say , two sports sedans based on skidpad numbers . This is not to suggest that skidpads are without value , however . Skidpads are an excellent educational tool at driving schools . They are simply of limited value in the comparison of anything except tires . Slalom times are slightly more useful ; they test some small parts of the automobile 's transient response . However , they are also heavily influenced by the stock rubber on the car , and they do not test many corners of the car 's envelope . They DO NOT tell you all you need to know before making a buying decision . For example , they do n't tell you what the rear end of the car will do on a road which suddenly goes off-camber . When a car has an adjustable suspension , these tests are usually done in the ` sport' setting , which may be quite unsuitable for daily driving . The list of caveats could go on for page after page . Q : My buddy claims that wide tires do n't make any difference , according to his freshman physics textbook , and that you ca n't ever accelerate or corner at more than 1.0G . Does he know what he 's talking about ? A : 1 ) in short : he has n't got a clue . 2 ) in more detail : the equations for friction used in freshman physics textbooks presume that the surfaces are smooth , dry and non-deformable , none of which properly apply to tire traction except in the case of a stone cold tire on dry pavement which is far below its proper operating temperature . Pavement is _never_ smooth ; it is always irregular to a greater or lesser extent . Tires , which are not really dry and solid ( as rubber is a substance which in its natural form is liquid , and which has only been coerced into a semblance of solidity by chemical magic ) , deform to match the surface of the pavement which a vehicle is traveling over . In a tire at operating temperature , grip is actually generated by shear stresses inside the deformed rubber , and not by anything even remotely resembling friction in the freshman physics sense of the term . The colder a tire is relative to its operating temperature , the closer its behaviour will be to the traditional concept of friction ; if much hotter than the its proper operating temperature , the more likely the possibility of some part of the tire actually `` reverting '' to liquid , which is mostly like to happen deep in the tread , causing characteristic blisters and chunking . ( This latter , though , is almost completely unlikely to happen in normal street driving , so unless you 're a competition driver or do a lot of high speed track driving , do n't worry about it . ) Because tire traction is completely out of the domain of simple friction , it does not obey the freshman physics equation at all ; thus dragsters accelerate at more than 1.0G and race cars corner and brake at more than 1.0G . Because simple friction does not apply , it is actually possible for different sized contact patches to generate differing amounts of grip . An actual analysis of tire behavior would require techniques such as Finite Element Analysis , due to the complexity of the mechanism . Misc . Questions : Q : What does < name or acronym > stand for ? A : Here is a list of some of the names which are commonly asked about ; be careful in soliciting the meanings of other names as misinformation abounds on the net . In particular , NEVER ask in rec.humor if you want a useful result . Saab : Svenska Aeroplan A . B. , or The Swedish Airplane Corporation Alfa : Societa Anonima Lombarda Fabbrica Automobili , or The Lombardy Automobile Manufacturing Company Fiat : Fabbrica Italiana di Automobili Torino , or The Italian Automobile Manufacturers of Turin BMW : Bayerische Motoren Werke , or Bavarian Motor Works MG : Morris Garage Q : Does VW own Porsche ? A : No . Porsche is a publicly held company , controlled by the Porsche and Piech families . Porsche has extensive business dealings with VW/Audi , which causes some confusion . Since currently Porsche is in some financial difficulty , there is a possibility that Mercedes or VW may be interested in purchasing the company in the near future , but this is only speculation at this time . -- richard welty 518-393-7228 welty @ cabot.balltown.cma.com `` Nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of a race car about either its pitch or roll axis '' -- Carroll Smith

That makes them the best method of defense for the citizenry . Not everybody has the time to train with a gladius , you know , but for some reason those who prey on others seem to have more free time . To extend this a bit further , you need only a certain level of competence to beat another with a range weapon . Getting in their face with a weapon and winning is much more difficult , and requires more training time the average citizen just does not have . I 've spent a few years practicing with a sword . I can take the common person armed with one ( though self-defense is n't the reason I own one ) . My kid sister would have an even chance of beating me , gun vs. gun , with only a month of training .

Taken into consideration in what respect ? Though quite wrong , let's make it a blanket statement for weapons in general . This has been taken into consideration .

In Norway I suspect it was about the only weapon available . You conquered your land ( among others ) a full millenia before we were thought of , and shortly thereafter weapons were n't quite so common . I suspect that a few world wars made a difference too , since in times of emergency weapons tend to be turned in or donated to needy causes . I 'm curious , though , were the weapons used in the crimes bought shortly before the crime , or were they aquired by other means ?

Maybe you had a bit more time , and a more homogeneous culture , to become civilized with ? > Yes , I know a little American history , but is it a civil/human > right to have an assault gun in your home and/or an handgun > in your car ? ? Yes . We 're too damned violent , partially I believe because we are not a homogeneous culture and do n't identify ourselves as `` Americans '' first and foremost . I 'm rather proud of my Norwegian and Danish heritage , whereas I suspect you could n't care less about that 2 % Welsh blood in your veins thanks to a raid in Ireland back in 1055 ? The time scale and the homogeneous culture are important . Equally important is a basic philosophical difference in personal versus collective good . In America , the individual is more important than the masses . Personal liberties are prized above all . This is , sadly , changing of late , but I trust you notice how this call for freedom makes laws that restrict individuals for little collective benefit hateful to Americans . I'd hazard a guess that , were America less interested in freedom and personal liberty and more interested in collective good we never would have sent our armed forces anywhere . One poor effect of this culture we have is that we 're looking out for ourselves and it is quite easy to identify with only a small segment of the population . My grandmother tells of being discriminated against back in Denmark because she spoke '' low Dane , '' whereas others spoke `` high Dane . '' It was shortly after World War II , as I remember , that `` low Dane '' was abolished so there was one common dialect .

It was the idea behind putting up a spacecraft that would more accurately respond to motions from the Earth 's gravity field and ignore drag . It was proposed many years ago and involved a ball floating between sensors whose job it was to signal to little adjustment jets to keep the ball away from them . The ball itself would then be in a drag free condition and respond only to gravity anisotropies , whereas the spacecraft itself would be continuously adjusting its position to compensate for drag .

It takes about 6 hours and a few tools to make one ( at least one of reasonable quality ) . Unless the drug dealer enjoyes messing around on a lathe ( say , as a hobby ) , he 's going to have to pay someone anyway .

Washington D.C. has a total ban on handguns and prohibits assembled rifles within city limits . It 's homicide rate is almost ten times the national average . It is also illegal for a D.C. resident to drive to the Virginia or Maryland suburbs and buy a gun ( dealers are required by federal law to check IDs and make sure the buyer is n't from another state ) so the ban can not be easily side-stepped . > > To show why the tools argument is the silliest i have ever seen.. take an > > analogy from computer science ... almost every computer science major > > can write a `` wordprocessor '' yet we ( comp sci majors ) would willingly pay 3 > > to 400 bucks for a professional software like wordperfect ... why do n't we > > just all write our own software ? ? ? ... ...

But it you could n't buy one , you would write your own ( in fact , people _did_ write their own 15 years ago ... ) More likely , you would find a friend who was a particularly good programer and get him give you a copy of his .

The only real problems are a ~25 % reduction in energy ( so a .357 magnum would `` only '' be as deadly as a 9mm ) and it makes alot more smoke ...

It clearly depends on the type of questions you are asking but in many cases it will do fine . The critical information from the neuron is in the firing frequency ( maximum about 100 action potentials per seconds ) , and not in the amplitude of the signal or in details of the signal shape . So the resolution of about 0.4 % you get with an 8 bit convertor is more then sufficient . AC coupling does not have to be a problem either , since in many cases you are not interested in the DC level . My pre amplifier is AC coupled also . The critical point is the lowest frequency that will pass . If the cutoff point is to high , the action potentials will be slightly distorted . But even that normally does not matter since it is the occurrence of the spike that is important . However , I do want to know what exactly I can expect before I start battling with the toolbox to get it going . As yet I have no clue were to start looking for the technical specifications .

My understanding is that the `` optional fpu '' refers to your option of purchasing the Centris 650 4/80 without FPU OR one of the other configurations WITH FPU . Apple does not offer an upgrade from the non-FPU system to become an FPU system . And , it is unclear whether the '040 processor on the non-FPU system ( a 68LC040 ) can be replaced with a 68RC040 supplied by another vendor . Apple did send a memo out at one point sating that the Centris 610 , which ONLY comes with a non-FPU 68LC040 processor CAN NOT be upgraded to support an FPU - the pin configurations of the two chips apparently do not match so you can not swap one for another ( again , according to Apple 's memo ) .

From : halsall @ murray.fordham.edu ( Paul Halsall ) Subject : Bible Unsuitable for New Christians Reply-To : halsall @ murray.fordham.edu Organization : J . Random Misconfigured Site Lines : 42 A `` new Christian '' wrote that he was new to the faith and learning about it `` by reading the Bible , of course '' . I am not at all sure this is the best path to follow . While the Bible is , for Christians , the word of God , the revelation of God is Jesus Christ and the chief legacy of this revalation is the Church . I am not recommending any one denommination , but I do recommend finding a comfortable christian congregation in which to develop your faith , rather than just reading the Bible . This does not mean that the Bible should not be read , although I would stick to the Gospels , epistles , and Psalms and avoid the Book of Revelation altogether [ until you are with friends you are comfortable with ] . I am sure that mistakenly fervent projects to read the entire Bible have frequently bogged down with a remarkable lack of fervour somewhere in the middle of Leviticus , or for the really sturdy , somewhere in Chronicles . The point is that the Bible is their to illustrate the Faith of Christians , but does not provide the totality of that faith . Vital beliefs of virtually all Christians are simply not mentioned - the Trinity , the duality of natures in Christ , types of Church organization . All these beliefs and practices have developed from the lived experience of the Christian people , an experience lived one hopes in the Spirit . As such the Bible , I think , is better studies in the context of a congregation , and the context of other reading . Following up on a suggestion of an old confessor of mine , I would even suggest that a good novel is a good way to reflect on the christian life . [ Most novels of any profundity are actually discussing the nature of good and evil in the human heart ] . My own induction into the christian faith was brought about [ after grace ] through reading Graham Greene : _The Power and the Glory_ and the poetry of Gerard Manley Hopkins . I would also recommend Graham Greene 's _Monsignor Quixote_ and any novel by Iris Murdoch . The last is not even a Christian , but such is her insistence on the need for the good life , that , frankly , I often am more uplifted and God directed after reading her than after reading many parts of the Bible . And that after all is what being a Christian is all about : letting your soul and your life be , in some way , directed towards the infinite , represented to us by the person of Jesus Christ .

( Design was in 2-micron n-well cmos , using the MOSIS scalable design rules . ) Here are some thoughts on the bypass capacitors : 1 ) They do n't help much with simultaneous output switching -- there is still a large inductance between the bypass capacitor and the load capacitor ( on both the signal line and the ground return ) , so you still get ground and power line bounce . 2 ) They do help a lot with on-chip loads , as I had with the high load on the clock lines . 3 ) The transients you are trying to suppress are really high frequency , so forget about large areas of poly-thin-oxide-diff capacitors , since the RC time constant is too large . What I did is to make a metal2 , metal , poly , diff sandwich , but put a lot of holes in the poly layer , allowing frequent diff-metal1 contacts . I forget exactly how wide the poly lines were . If I were doing this design again , I 'd probably omit the diff altogether , and use a solid poly sheet instead , using just m2 , m1 , and poly ( and substrate , but that has such a high resistance it can be ignored at these speeds ) . 4 ) You are probably better off trying to tune your circuit to run with slightly slower edges and lower voltage swings ( especially for output signalling ) , than spending chip area on capacitors . I had spare space on the die since the circuit was too big for a MOSIS tiny chip , and the next size up was twice as big as I needed .

I agree with the gentlemen who wrote the comment before me . The important thing is pick what ever interest you the most and learn as much as possible about it . In my five years of education in this field , though brief compare to alot of people , I had to think about this kind of question a lot . Did I make the right decision in going into Electrical Engineering as opposed to Computer engineering or CS ? The more I go thru school , the more I believe that this kind of question is irrelevant . I have come to believe that choosing CS because one does not like hardware or choosing hardware because one does not like to program is really doing an injustice of building and computer and making it useful for something . Everything is interwoven and inseparable . CS , CE , and EE are all a part of a really great discipline and do depend on each other . My advice is do n't limit yourself , but make a decision based on which major will give you the best opportunities to learn . That of course depends on the curriculum at your persective school . I would choose a major that allows me to explore as much as possible . Beside , I do n't know why the school would make a student choose a major before her/his sophamore year . Hey you may be so interested in this field that you decided to learn all about the making of computers in which case , you suffer a little more and go to grad school . About the money . Do n't look at the averages , if you are good , you are going to earn more money than anyone else . If you are a superstar programmer , you will earn millions .

Otherwise , if they > really looked closely they would find a reason to ban almost everything . > How in the world do you suppose it 's legal to `` consume '' tobacco products > ( which probably SHOULD be banned ) ? No , there is something called the `` Delany Amendment '' which makes carcinogenic food additives illegal in any amount . This was passed by Congress in the 1950 's , before stuff like mass spectrometry became available , which increased detectable levels of substances by a couple orders of magnitude . This is why things like cyclamates and Red # 2 were banned . They are very weakly carcinogenic in huge quantities in rats , so under the Act they are banned . This also applies to natural carcinogens . Some of you might remember a time back in the 1960 's when root beer suddenly stopped tasting so good , and never tasted so good again . That was the time when safrole was banned . This is the active flavoring ingredient in sassafras leaves . If it were possible to market a root beer good like the old days , someone would do it , in order to make money . The fact that no one does it indicates that enforcement is still in effect . An odd exception to the rule seems to be the product known as `` gumbo file ' '' . This is nothing more than coarsely ground dried sassafras leaves . This is not only a natural product , but a natural product still in its natural form , so maybe that 's how they evade Delany . Or maybe a special exemption was made , to appease powerful Louisiana Democrats .

Well , one thing you should do is poke around the terminals of the power amp chips . Use a probe with a 10M resistor ( like a scope probe ) connected to the input of a small audio amp w/speaker . If you find line-level input to both chips , one of the chips is bad and can probably replaced pretty easily . If you want to pick off a near-line-level signal , suitable for feeding to an outboard amp , the outer legs of the volume control pot will often be good enough . This is *before* the volume control ( and usually before the tone and balance controls too ) . If you take off from the center and ground legs of the volume pot , this will be after the volume control ( but again , probably before the other controls ) . If the unit is a modern type with an electronic volume control chip , you should probably forget the whole thing . -- - Jamie Hanrahan , Kernel Mode Systems , San Diego CA Internet : jeh @ cmkrnl.com Uucp : uunet ! cmkrnl ! jeh CIS : 74140,2055

This is what all this is about . Do you > get more performance for the money . Ok once again with the SCSI spec list : SCSI-1 { with a SCSI-1 controler chip } synchronous range is indeed 0-5MB/s asynchronous range is slower at 0-3MB/s . SCSI-1 { With a SCSI-2 controller chip } : 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst { 8-bit } Note the INCREASE in SPEED , the Mac Quadra uses this version of SCSI-1 so it DOES exist . Some PCs use this set up too . SCSI-2 { 8-bit/SCSI-1 mode } : 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst { for those who want SCSI-2 but do n't want to pay for the 16-bit or 32-bit hardware or mess with the SCSI-2 software controllers . Usable by SCSI-1 devices with close to 8-bit SCSI-2 speeds } SCSI-2 { 16-bit/wide or fast mode } : 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst SCSI-2 { 32-bit/wide AND fast } : 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst On the other interfaces let DXB132 @ psuvm.psu.edu speak : > IDE ranges from 0-8.3MB/s . Again synchronous and asynchronous modes with asynchronous much slower { Range 0-5MB/s } > ESDI is always 1.25MB/s ( although there are some non-standard versions ) One problem is the inconsitant use of the term 'SCSI ' in articles and by people . Its PROPER meaning is `` The set of SCSI interfaces composed of SCSI-1 AND SCSI-2 '' Look at the inconsitant use of SCSI in the below quote : ( My comments in { } ) PC Magazine April 27 , 1993:29 `` Although SCSI is twice as fast as ESDI , { This is asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-1 chip } 20 % faster than IDE ... '' { this is BOTH asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip AND 8-bit SCSI-2 } To read CONSITANTLY the quote SHOULD read : { asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-1 chip } '' Although asynchronous SCSI-1 is twice as fast as ESDI , one third the speed of IDE ... '' or { asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip or 8-bit SCSI-2 } '' Although SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip and 8-bit SCSI-2 are eight times as fast as ESDI , 20 % faster than IDE ... '' NOTE the NONUSE of 'SCSI ' by itself . This eliminates ambaguity . SCSI-1 drivers are somewhat reasonable while 16-bit and 32-bit SCSI-2 drivers are VERY expansive { 8-bit SCSI-2 can use SCSI-1 drivers with little speed degridation ( the Mac Quadra does EXACTLY this . ) } If we are to continue this thread STATE CLEARLY WHICH SCSI you are talking about SCSI-1 or SCSI-2 or SCSI over all { SCSI-1 AND SCSI-2 } IT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE .

'' You can dream whatever you wish . We have demands from the Armenians . With the Government of x-Soviet Armenia , we would sit down , go over all our outstanding issues , whether it 's land or reparations or recognition , whatever it is . We 'd like to sit down and ask for it . By all means , lands and properties were taken away from us and they should be returned to the rightful owners , the Turkish and Kurdish people , who were there 3,000 years , long before the Armenians ever showed up in that area . Entire population of the region was subjected to genocide beyond belief ; genocide which was planned to exterminate the whole Turkish people of the region to the last man , woman and child . Armenians tortured and massacred millions of defenseless civilians . To assemble innocent civilians in the mosques and burn them in the buildings was one of their methods . Even today the traveler in that region is seldom free from the evidence of these Armenian crimes . If you have the stomach , I would strongly recommend the following references on the Armenian genocide of the Muslims . Many more of them are also available in the 'Erzurum and Van Turkish Genocide Museums . ' 1 .

From : gnohmon @ ssiny.UUCP ( Ralph Betza ) Subject : dynamic SqueezeTitle configuration in *twm Keywords : TWM , twm , vtwm , tvtwm , ctwm Organization : Systems Strategies , Inc. , NY , NY Lines : 123 I consider TWM-style Squeezed Titles indispensable in a window manager . I like to have two tall xterm windows visible at the same time , with no overlap ; and since two windows are n't enough , I have other xterm windows underneath them , with exactly the same positioning . In case you 're not familiar with Squeezed Titles , here 's a crude picture : ====================== Figure 1 ==================================== | | + -- -- -- -- -+ + -- -- -- -- -+ +=========+ | + title A + + title B + + title C + | + -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- + + -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- + | + this is the + + window B hides window C , but + | + body of the + + you can still see C 's title + | + window , window A + + which is squeezed right . + | + -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- + + -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- + | ====================== Figure 1 ==================================== Squeezed titles allow me to have about 5 such windows in each stack , with easy access ; and 3 per stack is usually more than I really need , since I also insist on having a virtual WM . The only problem is that the title location is static , that is , it is configured in .twmrc , and in order to change it you have to edit that file and restart the window manager . Doing so is cumbersome and time-consuming . Therefore , I have implemented f.squeeze { left , center , right } functions in my own copy of vtwm ; the idea being that with one click of a button , you can change this : + -- -- -- -- -+ + title A + + -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- + + this is the + + body of the + + window , window A + + -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- + to this : + -- -- -- -- -+ + title A + + -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- + + this is the + + body of the + + window , window A + + -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- + =============== Okay . So far , so good . Now , how the heck do I get them to put this into the next `` official '' twm , and the next tvtwm , and the next vtwm , and the next ctwm ? And the next xyztwm that I never heard of ? One way would be to post , in comp.windows.x , a description of this enhancement , together with an explanation of why I think it is a Very Good Thing , and hope that someone reads it . : - ) In case it is n't already clear why I think it 's a Very Good Thing , look back up at Figure 1 , and picture window A moved over on top of windows B and C ; now window A 's title hides Window B 's title ; but when you hit f.squeezecenter , the result is : +=========+ + -- -- -- -- -+ +=========+ + title B + + title A + + title C + + -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -+ + this is the body of the window , + + window A , which is on top . + + -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -+ =================== The rest of this posting explains how to implement it , based on my X11R4 copy of vtvwm.shar ; it 's just a sketch because posting the full diffs would be too long . The key to this enhancement is to add the following lines in the ExecuteFunction ( ) routine in menus.c : # ifdef SHAPE case F_SQUEEZELEFT : { static SqueezeInfo left_squeeze = { J_LEFT , 0 , 0 } ; if ( DeferExecution ( context , func , Scr- > SelectCursor ) ) return TRUE ; tmp_win- > squeeze_info = & left_squeeze ; SetFrameShape ( tmp_win ) ; break ; } ... . and similarly for squeezeright ( J_RIGHT ) and squeezecenter ( J_CENTER ) ... # endif ( Of course , you also have to define F_SQUEEZELEFT in parse.h and add { `` f.squeezeleft '' , FKEYWORD , F_SQUEEZELEFT } , ... and so forth ... to parse.c In order to use these functions , add something like the following to your .twmrc file : Button2 = m | s : w|v|d|r|i|t|door : f.squeezecenter ================= About a year ago , I posted this , but our news was broken and I *think* it did n't get out . Since then , `` blast '' has appeared in comp.sources.x , Volume 19 , Issue 41 ; you could use blast to achieve a similar effect , by chiseling away at an mwm-style wide title . Better to have a twm-style window manager , I think . -- Ralph Betza ( FM ) , uunet ! ssiny ! gnohmon gnohmon @ ssiny.com '' The question of whether a computer can swim is more interesting than the question of whether a submarine can think '' - Lenny Dykstra

If all that is required is that people are willing to die for a belief for it to be true , then surely David Koresh is the son of God . No , the spurrious arguement that the resurrection had to be true for people to be willing to die must be put to rest . The other problem is that it is so monologocentric . Even if the resurrection was a big deal ( which it doesn't seem to have been for either Q , Thomas , or even John to a certain degree ) there are a lot of other things which the Early Christians could have been doing together that would have been worth dying for . It is my belief that even the idea of a mixed race community , which brought down regional/national boundaries in the name of koinonia could have been enough for people to be willing to die . Radical communties do that ( e.g . Jonestown , Waco , Warsaw , etc ) But my original point was that roman persecution ( which is the only persecution we have documented proof of ) was not about whether a carpenter came back from the dead . Such a claim was not unique nor particularly abhorent to the roman or greek mind . My point is that avoidance of military and civic duty ( i.e . emperor worship ) would have been much more problematic -- which has nothing to do with the resurrection at all . When nero used christians as human torches to light up his dinner party it was n't because the believe in a risen savior , it was because they were supposedly involved in incest and cannablism . The argument that christians were martyred for the resurrection just can not stand up to critical examination . randy

A couple of years I was involved in a low-speed getoff in which I landed on my back on the pavement . My head ( helmeted ) hit the pavement with a `` clunk '' , leaving a couple of dings and chips in the paint at the point of impact , but no other visible damage . I called the helmet manufacturer and inquired about damage . They said that the way a fiberglass shell works is to first give , then delaminate , then crack . This is the way fiberglass serves to spread the force of the impact over a wider area . After the fiberglass has done its thing , the crushable foam liner takes care of absorbing ( hopefully ) the remaining impact force . They told me that the second stage of fiberglass functionality ( delamination of the glass/resin layers ) can occur with NO visible signs , either inside or outside of the helmet . They suggested that I send them the helmet and they would inspect it ( including X-raying ) . I did so . They sent back the helmet with a letter stating that that they could find no damage that would compromise the ability of the helmet to provide maximum protection . ( I suspect that this letter would eliminate their being able to claim prior damage to the helmet in the event I were to sue them . ) The bottom line , though , is that it appears that a helmets integrity can be compromised with no visible signs . The only way to know for sure is to send it back and have it inspected . Note that some helmet manufacturers provide inspections services and some do not .

I 've been doing it my self over 200,000 miles , on my current toyota truck I 've got over 150k . I 've heard people talk about how doing this can damage a transmission . My experiences suggest otherwise . What techniques do you use ? On some old pieces of junk I drove , the transmission was so worn that pumping the clutch was the only way to shift , except clutchless . To date I 've driven rabbits , datsuns , comets , fords & a chevy . Some where harder than others to shift but generally the higher the milage the smoother quicker & easier they where to shift . My technique is to ease back off the throttle and at the same time gently wrist back on the shift lever . If for some reason I miss the shift window , I lightly press the accelerator & try agian . I 've found that clutchless shifting is eaiser/quicker at high rpms ( 4000-7000 ) . I also skip gears some times using 1-3-5 ,1-2-4-5. krispy

I 've been saying that for at least 2 years now and even the A 's conditioning guru told Jose he was carrying too much weight and losing some would help his back.Although I do n't for one second believe Jose used steroids , his back problems are very similar to problems alot of steroid users experience because they are simply carrying too much weight on their frame ( see Jeff Bregel ex 49er as a textbook example ) , and IMHO Jose is too big for his frame . > 2 .

I do n't know , he had an even more open stance when he first came up with the A 's , and had no problems with it then . It might be that pre-back problems , he was quick enough to cover up any deficiencies the stance caused , but now he 's lost just enough bat speed that the stance hurts him . The old saying if you 're hot its a trigger mechanism , if you're cold , its a hitch . > First , minimize movement before the swing . Close and widen the stance , > and severely cut down the stride I take on my swing . Hopefully , this > will cut down on the time I need to swing , and will allow me to move > the bathead more freely . The biggest problem IMHO is he never has found a stance he 's comfortable with for more than a few months . He changes his stance so much , he loses track of where the strike zone is . In Wednesday 's night game , he was clearly mad at strike calls on both corners that looked pretty good to me . I think he no longer knows where the strike zone really is because he 's changed his stance so much . I 'm also a bit concerned that because he 's got Palmer and Gonzalez hitting all the homeruns , he 'll become competitive , swing even harder and screw himself up even worse . LaRussa always said that Canseco 's famous batting practice homer shows did him more harm than good as they encouraged bad hitting habits .

Additionally , it is hard to say what type of response you ar3e having to prednisone since you did not say how long you have been on it . Patients are generally kept on steroids for months before thinking about tapering . Alternatives to daily dosing are every other day dosing , in your case 20mg every other day would be a start . Another option if it is not possible to get you off prednisone is to start azathioprine . Like Spenser said , you should generally be on another drug in addition to your prednisone , like asulfidine . A lot of the specifics about options , though , depends on severity , location , and duration of disease , as well as histology , so take advice off the net for what it is worth . I treat patients with UC and Crohn 's . An educated patient is a good patient , but let your doctor know where the advice came from so things can be put in context .

CORPSES LITTER HILLS IN KARABAKH ANATOL LIEVEN COMES UNDER FIRE WHILE FLYING WITH AZERBAIJANI FORCES TO INVESTIGATE THE ALLEGED MASS KILLINGS OF REFUGEES BY ARMENIAN TROOPS ... As we swooped low over the snow-covered hills of Nagorno-Karabagh we saw the scattered corpses . Apparently , the refugees had been shot down as they ran . An Azerbaijani film of the places we flew over , shown to journalists afterwards , showed DOZENS OF CORPSES lying in various parts of the hills . The Azerbaijanis claim that AS MANY AS 1000 have died in a MASS KILLING of AZERBAIJANIS fleeing from the town of Khodjaly , seized by Armenians last week . A further 4,000 are believed to be wounded , frozen to death or missing ... Seven of us squatted in the cabin of an Azerbaijani M24 attack helicopter as we flew to investigate the claims of the mass killings . Suddenly there was a thump against the underside of the aircraft , a red flash of tracer ripped past the starboard wing , and the helicopter rocked sharply . We swung round , and there was a deafening burst of fire from the cannon under our wing as the helicopter crew returned fire . We had been fired on from an Armenian anti-aircraft post . We swung round again , tipped to starboard and appeared to dive straight down into a valley . The brown earth swooped around our heads , the helicopter swung round again and followed the contours of the ground . Our cannon fired repeated blasts . Later it emerged that a civilian helicopter that we had been escorting had landed successfully at Nakhichevanik in the east of the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh , to pick up some of the dead . We had , in fact , been attacked both by ground fire and by an Armenian helicopter . I had seen the Armenian helicopter intermittently through the window , its cannons firing , but had thought - mistakenly - that it was on '' our side '' . Our group of Western journalists had embarked on a search-and-rescue flight that had become a combat mission . Our flight consisted of the civilian passenger helicopter and two M24 Soviet attack helicopters in the Azerbaijani service , nicknamed flying crocodiles for their armour . Our party was in the second crocodile . The civilian helicopter 's job was to land in the mountains and pick up bodies at sites of the mass killings . The attack helicopters were there to give covering fire if necessary . The operation showed a striking sign of the disintegration of the Soviet armed forces because our pilot was a Russian officer . An Azerbaijani official told us that there were now five former Soviet military helicopters -and their pilots- fighting for Azerbaijan . `` They have signed contracts to fly for us , '' he said . The helicopter we engaged in combat was most probably flown by a brother-officer of our Russian pilot , but fighting for the Armenians . We had taken off just before 5pm on Saturday from Agdam airfield , an heated for the Armenian-controlled mountains of Karabakh , a sheer white wall in the distance . The civilian helicopter picked up four corpses , and it was during this and a previous mission that an Azerbaijani cameraman filmed the several the several dozen bodies on the hillsides . We then took off again in a hurry and speed back towards Azerbaijani lines . Azerbaijani gunners on the last hill before the plain - and safety - gazed up at us as we passed . Back at the airfield in Agdam , we took a look the bodies the civilian helicopter had picked up . Two old men a small girl were covered with blood , their limbs contorted by the cold and rigor mortis . They had been shot . What did our Russian pilot think of the tragedy , our close shave , and the war in Nagorno-Karabakh ? He gave us CHEERFUL GRIN , POLITELY DECLINED TO ANSWER QUES TIONS , AND MARCHED OFF TO HIS DINNER .

From : allanh @ sco.COM ( Allan J. Heim ) Subject : Re : Ban All Firearms ! Organization : The Santa Cruz Operation , Inc. Lines : 34 jrm @ gnv.ifas.ufl.edu : Firearms tend to fall into this low dollar/pound area . It would not be economic to smuggle them in . All production would have to be local . There are not all that many people who have both the skill AND motivation to assemble worthwhile firearms from scratch . High-ranking crime figures could obtain imported Uzis and such , but the average person , and average thug , would be lucky to get a zip-gun - and would pay through the nose for it . Good point you make . However , a zip gun , by definition , is a crude , homemade gun -- certainly not something capable of sustained , accurate fire , but it would be useful as a means of getting a normal gun . Recall the tiny , single-shot pistols made by the Allies during World War II for use by partisans . They were essentially well-made zipguns , incapable of effective fire beyond a few feet . But they were useful as a means of killing German soldiers for their guns . Also note that the crowd-pleasin ' favorite , the Sten gun , was specifically designed to require as little machine work as possible . The point 's been made here that one could make a Sten clone with steel tubing , hand tools and a welder . I still think that while the point is good , I think there 's a difference between marijuana and firearms , in that quality marijuana can be grown locally ; there 's no need to import the stuff . If guns are banned , I think the demand for `` real '' guns will be sufficient to make smuggling economically feasible , thus rendering a ban moot . In any case , the result would be the same -- people who are n't criminals wo n't have firearms , and `` bad guys '' will continue to have access to them , one way or another .

Not that I think we should n't hear about the bad deals , but it would be nice to hear some good news once in a while . After seeing his post on one of the for sale groups , I mailed Mr. Mark Miller a request for his copy of WordPerfect 5.1 for DOS .

Imagine my surprise when I logged into my account the following day and found a message from him saying that it had already been sold ( after I had just mailed the money order ) . After another E-Mail message to him , he apologized and assured me that it was a mistake - I was the one who he was holding it for . He sent the package as soon as he got the money , along with a letter stating a transfer of license . This was n't good enough for WordPerfect , so I asked him to fill out one of their forms . No problem - we thought . It took three times to get it to the right address ( my fault ) . Anyway , he mailed me the form for my signature and included a Workbook that I had no idea was included in the deal . Again , he apologized for not sending it before . I now have the world's best word processor and a renewed hope in the world that there are a few good ones left . I recoend that if you ever see that Mark is selling anything thatat you may want , give him a call . If I had the choice , I would purchase all of my software from him .

Trying to make comparisons between Israels politics and Nazi German- Austrian politics shows only your degree of ignorance ( high ) , intellect ( low ) , humanity ( none ) and antisemitism ( average ) . I respect anybody who dissagrees with me as long as he respects me and discusses in a civilized manner . I would never say that anybody that critizises Israel and/or its politics is an antisemite , except he uses antisemitic vocabulary/terminology/demagogy . Israel is not a perfect country and its politicians also commits errors , even some of them are corrupt ( like politicians in any other country ) , but they carry a huge burden : to care for the safety of ALL its citizens , and that is really not an easy task in a country that is surrounded by enemies who only expect that Israel commits the ONE BIG ERROR and wipe the country ( and its Jewish citizens plus the so-called collaborators , arabs that wanted to live in peace with their Jewish neighbours ) of the map . As I said , Israel is not a perfect country , but it is the ONLY democracy in the whole Middle-East and the only country in the world where Jews from everywhere can have a refuge in case of persecutions in the countries they are living . Our long history has taught us that we can not rely on non-Jewish nations and its governments : as soon as there are more or les big social-economical-political problems in any country , the first ones that pay for the broken glasses are the Jews , and later the other minorities of the country . > I do n't think the suffering of some Jews during WWII ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ > justifies the crimes commited by the Israeli government .

You order distinctive ringing from your phone company . This is $ 3/month here . You get a second ( unpublished ) phone number . When someone calls this number , your phone rings with short rings instead of long rings . You set up your answering machine on 4 rings and your fax on six rings . You 'd give out the new # as your fax # . A device would measure the length of rings . When it detects a short ring , it turns off your answering machine . Five rings later your fax picks up the call . This should be cheaper and more elegant than the $ 80 switches now available . But that 's not what I did . I 'm giving out the new # to my friends and customers . This should leave the old # for telemarketers , etc . I wo n't pick up the phone when I hear the long rings . -- '' Why my thoughts are my own , when they are in , but when they are out they are another 's .

Ouch . : - ) This brings to mind one of the recommendations in the Hurt Study . Because the rear of the gas tank is in close proximity to highly prized and easily damaged anatomy , Hurt et al recommended that manufacturers build the tank so as to reduce the , er , step function provided when the rider 's body slides off of the seat and onto the gas tank in the unfortunate event that the bike stops suddenly and the rider does n't .

Libertarians and anarchists are not alone in being uncomfortable with the use of state sponsored coercion . The notion that coercion can be virtually eliminated in a society ( or more properly that once it is eliminated on the part of the state it is no longer worth serious consideration ) is a view that is peculiar to libertarians and anarchists . For example , does `` non-initiated force '' ( coercion ) include tax collection ? Does it include the minimal level of regulation of commerce envisioned by Adam Smith ? Since coercion can be exercised by actors other than the state , how is the state to deal with it ? Exclusively through after the fact arbitration/legal compulsion ? > > The means to reaching such a restricted government is another topic > which I 'll address briefly . It certainly wo n't happen until > libertarianism is the dominate philosophy . What means do we have to > make libertarianism the dominate philosophy ? Statists run the education > monopoly , so we have to be creative . The Advocates for Self-Government > reports 85 % of their Seminar 1 participants `` embrace '' libertarianism . > That 's the best means I 've seen yet . We should lobby for compulsory > Seminar 1 attendance . : ) [ in jest ! ] Well , I must admit that the picture of libertarians as Amway participants is somewhat more reassuring than the idea of them trying to govern a complex , conflictual , industrial society . I 'd venture to point out , however , that if libertarians could n't convince at least 85 % of a group of `` seminar participants '' to `` embrace '' their philosophy , their propaganda skills need to be honed . Frankly , however , it is no great trick to create a government for a society in which ( almost ) everyone is assumed to agree about what is a proper government policy . Once that is assumed , all sorts of annoying formalities can be dispensed with , elections , police , etc . And as Mr. Marx said , the state will just wither away . On the way there , however , would you like to explain how eliminating virtually all policies that restrain private coercion in the current society will help us to live happier lives ? Or is it like socialism ; just some short-term pain that we 'll have to bear until everyone has had the benefit of `` re-education '' through regular '' seminar '' training ? jsh > > Roger Collins -- Steve Hendricks | DOMAIN : steveh @ thor.ISC-BR.COM '' One thing about data , it sure does cut| UUCP : ... ! uunet ! isc-br ! thor ! steveh the bulls**t.

They run Voyager , Magellan , Galileo , and will run Cassini , CRAF , etc . etc.. For images , probe navigation , and other info about unmanned exploration , this is the place to go . JPL is run under contract for NASA by the nearby California Institute of Technology , unlike the NASA centers above . This distinction is subtle but critical . JPL has different requirements for unsolicited research proposals and summer hires . For instance in the latter , an SF 171 is useless . Employees are Caltech employees , contractors , and for the most part have similar responsibilities . They offer an alternative to funding after other NASA Centers .

This feature adjusts the endpoints of lines so that the displayed line looks better on low resolution devices . The PostScript literature explains the process to some extent . They also give an example of how to `` emulate '' strokeadjust in PostScript environments where it is absent . The suggested emulation is to modify the coordinates of the endpoints of a line using the following formula for each coordinate : new_coord = ( round ( old_coord - 0.25 ) ) + 0.25 Doing this we end up with all coordinates ending in `` .25 '' . From reading I thought that what they might actually do is : new_coord = ( ( trunc ( old_coord * 2 ) ) / 2 ) + 0.25 This results in all the coordinates ending in either `` 0.25 '' or `` 0.75 '' whichever is closer . By doing some actual comparisons with Display PostScript , I find that neither of these is what DPS really uses . Since I like how the DPS result looks better than how my stuff looks , I 'd like to know if anyone who knows how DPS does it is willing/able to tell me . Thanks , -- Steve squeegee @ world.std.com
From : trajan @ cwis.unomaha.edu ( Stephen McIntyre ) Subject : Theists And Objectivity Organization : University of Nebraska at Omaha Lines : 90 Can a theist be truly objective ? Can he be impartial when questioning the truth of his scriptures , or will he assume the superstition of his parents when questioning ? I 've often found it to be the case that the theist will stick to some kind of superstition when wondering about God and his scriptures . I've seen it in the Christian , the Jew , the Muslim , and the other theists alike . All assume that their mothers and fathers were right in the aspect that a god exists , and with that belief search for their god . Occasionally , the theist may switch religions or aspects of the same religion , but overall the majority keep to the belief that some `` Creator '' was behind the universe 's existence . I've known Muslims who were once Christians and vice versa , I 've known Christians who were once Jewish and vice versa , and I 've even known Christians who become Hindu . Yet , throughout their transition from one faith to another , they 've kept this belief in some form of higher `` being . '' Why ? It usually all has to do with how the child is brought up . From the time he is born , the theist is brought up with the notion of the `` truth '' of some kind of scripture -- the Bible , the Torah , the Qur'an , & etc . He is told of this wondrous God who wrote ( or inspired ) the scripture , of the prophets talked about in the scripture , of the miracles performed , & etc . He is also told that to question this ( as children are apt to do ) is a sin , a crime against God , and to lose belief in the scrip- ture 's truth is to damn one 's soul to Hell . Thus , by the time he is able to read the scripture for himself , the belief in its `` truth '' is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a matter of course . But it does n't stop there . Once the child is able to read for himself , there is an endeavor to inculcate the child the `` right '' readings of scripture , to concentrate more on the pleasant readings , to gloss over the worse ones , and to explain away the unexplainable with `` mystery . '' Circular arguments , `` self-evdent '' facts and `` truths , '' unreasoning belief , and fear of hell is the meat of religion the child must eat of every day . To doubt , of course , means wrath of some sort , and the child must learn to put away his brain when the matter concerns God . All of this has some considerable effect on the child , so that when he becomes an adult , the superstitions he 's been taught are nearly impossible to remove . All of this leads me to ask whether the theist can truly be objective when questioning God , Hell , Heaven , the angels , souls , and all of the rest . Can he , for a moment , put aside this notion that God *does* exist and look at everything from a unbiased point of view ? Obviously , most theists can somewhat , especially when presented with `` mythical gods '' ( Homeric , Roman , Egyptian , & etc. ) . But can they put aside the assumption of God 's existence and question it impartially ?

This is a common misconception . There was nothing `` off the wall '' about the Wright Brothers .

Religious Studies Dept , Saint Mary 's University , Halifax , N.S . > Armstrong @ husky1.stmarys.ca | att ! clyde ! watmath ! water ! dalcs ! armstrng I apologize to the moderator , but the first quote was deleted and I would like to respond to both . As for the `` goal we can never achieve '' , the reward comes from the trying . Paul makes a clear claim that we are to continue straining for the prize over in Philippians 3:10-16 . Only by not living out the commands do we stagnate and become lukewarm , to be spit out by Jesus . As it says in 1 John 5:3 : `` This is love for God : to obey his comands . '' That obedience is our straining to achieve for God . Of course , this requires work on our part . As for the quote in James , Satan does n't care what we believe . What matters is the results of our belief ( works ) . If one truly has faith in what one believes , one will either act on that faith or be lying to oneself about believing in the first place . Stan , as for your first line , you have a very good point . Obedience by obligation ( grudgery ) is not what God desires . Instead , look at how many times the Bible talks about being joyous in all situations and when doing God 's work . Being begrudged by the work has no value . Also , we should do the work necessary whenever we can , not just when we feel Jesus ' presence . Feelings can deceive us . However , as Paul states to Timothy in 2 Timothy 4:2 : `` Preach the Word ; be prepared in season and out of season ; correct , rebuke and encourage -- with great patience and careful instruction . '' Also , remember that Paul tells Timothy in 1 Timothy 4:16 : `` Watch your life and doctrine closely . Persevere in them , because if you do , you will save both yourself and your hearers . '' So , in order to do the work necessary , we need to be sure that we are correct first . Remember Jesus ' warning in Matthew 7:3-5 not to be hypocritical about what we do . The best way to accomplish this is to be a disciple completely in both thought and deed . Joe Fisher

From : dbd @ urartu.sdpa.org ( David Davidian ) Subject : Lezgians Astir in Azerbaijan and Daghestan Summary : asking not to fight against Armenians in Karabakh & for unification Organization : S.D.P.A . Center for Regional Studies Lines : 106 04/19/1993 0000 Lezghis Astir By NEJLA SAMMAKIA Associated Press Writer GUSSAR , Azerbaijan ( AP ) -- The 600,000 Lezghis of Azerbaijan and Russia have begun clamoring for their own state , threatening turmoil in a tranquil corner of the Caucasus . The region has escaped the ethnic warfare of neighboring Nagorno-Karabakh , Abkhazia and Ossetia , but Lezhgis could become the next minority in the former Soviet Union to fight for independence . Lezghis , who are Muslim descendents of nomadic shepherds , are angry about the conscription of their young men to fight in Azerbaijan 's 5-year-old undeclared war with Armenia . They also want to unite the Lezghi regions of Azerbaijan and Russia , which were effectively one until the breakup of the Soviet Union created national borders that had been only lines on a map . A rally of more than 3,000 Lezghis in March to protest conscription and demand a separate `` Lezghistan '' alarmed the Azerbaijani government . Officials in Baku , the capital , deny rumors that police shot six demonstrators to death . But the government announced strict security measures and began cooperating with Russian authorities to control the movement of Lezhgis living across the border in the Dagestan region of Russia . Visitors to Gussar , the center of Lezhgi life , found the town quiet soon after the protest . Children played outdoors in the crisp mountain air . At the Sunday bazaar , men in heavy coats and dark fur hats gathered to discuss grievances ranging from high customs duties at the Russian border to a war they say is not theirs . `` I have been drafted , but I wo n't go , '' said Shamil Kadimov , gold teeth glinting in the sun . `` Why must I fight a war for the Azerbaijanis ? I have nothing to do with Armenia . '' More than 3,000 people have died in the war , which centers on the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh , about 150 miles to the southeast . Malik Kerimov , an official in the mayor 's office , said only 11 of 300 locals drafted in 1992 had served . `` The police do n't force people to go , '' he said . `` They are afraid of an uprising that could be backed by Lezghis in Dagestan . '' All the men agreed that police had not fired at the demonstrators , but disagreed on how the protest came about . Some said it occurred spontaneously when rumors spread that Azerbaijan was about to draft 1,500 men from the Gussar region , where 75,000 Lezghis live . Others said the rally was ordered by Gen. Muhieddin Kahramanov , leader of the Lezhgi underground separatist movement , Sadval , based in Dagestan . `` We organized the demonstration when families came to us distraught about draft orders , '' said Kerim Babayev , a mathematics teacher who belongs to Sadval . `` We hope to reunite peacefully , by approaching everyone -- the Azerbaijanis , the Russians . '' In the early 18th century , the Lezhgis formed two khanates , or sovereignties , in what are now Azerbaijan and Dagestan . They roamed freely with their sheep over the green hills and mountains between the two khanates . By 1812 , the Lezghi areas were joined to czarist Russia . After 1917 , they came under Soviet rule . With the disintegration of the Soviet Union , the 600,000 Lezghis were faced for the first time with strict borders . About half remained in Dagestan and half in newly independent Azerbaijan . `` We have to pay customs on all this , on cars , on wine , '' complained Mais Talibov , a small trader . His goods , laid out on the ground at the bazaar , included brandy , stomach medication and plastic shoes from Dagestan . `` We want our own country , '' he said . `` We want to be able to move about easily . But Baku wo n't listen to us . '' Physically , it is hard for outsiders to distinguish Lezhgis from other Azerbaijanis . In many villages , they live side by side , working at the same jobs and intermarrying to some degree . But the Lezhgis have a distinctive language , a mixture of Arabic , Turkish and Persian with strong guttural vowels . Azerbaijan officially supports the cultural preservation of its 10 largest ethnic minorities . The Lezghis have weekly newspapers and some elementary school classes in their language . Autonomy is a different question . If the Lezghis succeeded in separating from Azerbaijan , they would set a precedent for other minorities , such as the Talish in the south , the Tats in the nearby mountains and the Avars of eastern Azerbaijan . -- David Davidian dbd @ urartu.sdpa.org | `` How do we explain Turkish troops on S.D.P.A .

Under Ultrix , I believe that '' local:0 '' is also a valid display name ( a shared memory connection maybe ? ) . Are there other strings that I should check for ? Is there a better way to detect this ? Thank you for any help you can give me . -- ======================================================================== Jim Atkinson Wavefront Technologies , Inc. jra @ wti.com What , me ?

Carlos , Why not check out some of the scientific research that has been done in this area and convince yourself . Research around the world indicates that the issue of coercion is the critical factor . For those interested in research on the topic I can suggest , Li et al ( England ) , Constantine ( United States ) , and Sandfort ( The Netherlands ) .

Simply avoiding > mistakes does n't get you anywhere . I think that Lee Lady and I are talking at cross purposes . Above , Lady seems concerned with the contrast between great science that makes big advances in our knowledge and mediocre science that makes smaller steps . In most of this thread , I have been concerned with the difference between what is science and what is not . Lee Lady is correct when she asserts that the difference between Einstein and the average post-doc physicist is the quality of their thought . But what is the difference between Einstein and a genius who would be a great scientist but whose great thoughts are scientifically screwy ? ( Some would give Velikovsky or Korzybski as examples . If you do n't like these , choose your own . ) I say it is the same as the difference between the mediocre physicist and the mediocre proponent of qi . Both Einstein and the mediocre physcists have disciplined their work from the cumulative knowledge of how previous researchers went wrong . Both Velikovsky and the mediocre proponent of qi have failed to do this . Let me approach this from a second direction . When one is asked to review a paper for a journal or conference , there are many kinds of criticism that one can make . One kind of criticism is that the work is just wrong or misinformed . Another kind of criticism is that the work , while technically correct , is either not important or not interesting . The first difference is the one that I have been pointing to . The second difference is the one that Lee Lady seems to be discussing . > If good empirical research were done and showed that there is some merit > to homeopathic remedies , this would certainly be valuable information . > But it would still not mean that homeopathy qualifies as a science . This > is where you and I disagree with Turpin . I have often pointed out that for homeopathy to be considered scientific , what is needed is a test of its theoretical claims , not just of some of its proposed remedies . Similarly , I suspect that traditional Chinese medicine has many remedies that work ; what it lacks ( as one example ) is any experiment that tests the presence of qi . > ... In order to have science , one must have a theoretical > structure that makes sense , not a mere collection of empirically > validated random hypotheses . Certainly a `` theoretical structure that makes sense '' is the goal . In areas where we do not yet have this , I see nothing wrong with forming and testing smaller hypotheses . Let 's face it : we can not always wait for an Einstein to come along and make everything clear for us . Sometimes those of us who are not Einstein have to plug along and make small amounts of progress as best we can . Russell

It seems > that the most stolen bikes are Harleys and 600cc Jap sport bikes . Well , I 'd say you 're mostly right , but for different reasons . ( BTW , as of a couple years ago , the most stolen bikes in Orange County and SF were 750 GSX 's and Ninjas ) . Probably the biggest reason BMWs are n't ripped off is that most people who buy BMWs will only deal with the actual BMW dealer , or mail- order types . Most of these can have their inventory checked fairly easily by law-enforcement types , and their mark-up is usually sufficient to keep them honest about acquiring parts . For Harleys and rice-rockets , you 've got 2 different situations . There is a HUGE aftermarket in Harley parts , so a bike can be parted out fairly easily . Ditto the non-sport Japanese bikes , but the prices on the parts for these are not as high , comparatively . For the 'rockets ' , anytime a bike goes down , the plastic is usually cracked , and is expensive to replace . It 's fairly easy , then , for a disreputable shop to take a fairing from a stolen bike , slap it on a bike in for repair , repaint it , and make a tidy profit . The other parts , more traceable , can be used , or discarded if they are too traceable .

Lines : 37 Regarding the post for information about the Mac Portable and the Powerbook 100 , here are a couple of the answers : ( 1 ) Does the Mac Portable support Appletalk ? Yes ( 2 ) What CPU is in the Mac Portable ? A low power version of the 68000 running at 15.87 Mhz . ( 3 ) Does the Mac Portable run system 7 ? Yes , although it does use up a lot of memory . ( 4 ) Is memory still availabe for the Portable ? There are several vendors that still make RAM for the Portable . There are two options : Some vendors sell memory that plugs into the RAM Slot inside the portable . Others sell memory that plugs into the Processor Direct Slot . Either way , the most memory you can address is either 8 or 9 megabytes , depending on whether the Portable is Backlit or not . King Memory and Peripherials in Irvine California is the cheapest place I know of for Portable memory . 2MB - $ 140 , 4 MB , $ 250 , and 7 MB $ 415 . I still see several ads in macuser that are selling 4 MB modules for $ 450 . Wide variety in pricing here . ( 5 ) What is the internal HD ? Its a Conner CP-3045 40 MB HD with an average access time of about 25 ms. ( 6 ) Is the screen better that the PB 100 ? Heavens yes ! The PB 100 is a backlit PASSIVE matrix screen which means it fades out on you if you move your head a few degrees left or right . The Portable has a backlit or non-backlit ACTIVE Matrix screen which I think is a joy to read . Other things to consider - Where to get the portable and how much to pay for it ? A good supplier has been SelectTerm in Mass . They were willing to sell a 2MB Non-backlit Portable with an internal 2400 bps modem for about $ 650 . Or a 4 MB Backlit Portable with an internal 2400 bps modem for about $ 900 . The answer is call around for a good while or you 'll pay too much . I 'm still looking for an internal FAX modem for the portable ?

Also consider the 90VAC+ @ 20Hz that is forced on ring and tip when the phone 's supposed to ring ! Even with a simple zener and LED setup , you might end up with some carbon real quick . Whatever scheme you use , make sure you 've got at least 200V-rated components on the frontend . Also remember that , if I 'm not mistaken , the phone line is a 600ohm equivalent circuit . Any current you draw from the 48V or so gets dropped across that 600ohms . That 's fine until you 're down to roughly 12V , when Ma Bell considers it to be off-hook . But dropping it that far down is probably a big no-no . The easiest implementation to accomplish the above ? ? tip -- -- -- - > | -- -- -\/\/\/\ -- -- -+ -- -- -- -- -- + rectifier resistor | | diode | \ V / zener / -- -/ \ resistor | / | | | V LED | -- - | | ring -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- + -- -- -- -- -- + This is only a suggestion ... go ahead and blow holes in it , but you get the idea .

From : salmon @ cwis.unomaha.edu ( David Salmon ) Subject : Re : HELP - SCSI Woes on Mac IIfx Organization : University of Nebraska at Omaha Lines : 16 According to the official documentation , failure to use the IIfx terminator can not only affect SCSI bus performance but can also damage the bus . Whether this is your problem or not I do n't know . I have had sporadic SCSI problems with my IIfx since I bought it . ( I can not connect more than three devices , fourth one causes major problems ) . First thing to do is to try to reformat your drive on someone elses system . If you continue to get errors it is probably the drive . If it formats fine then I would try to format it on your system with no externals . If this fails then the SCSI controller on your IIfx needs repair/replacement . Hope this helps . -- David C. Salmon salmon @ unomaha.edu

Are there traditional > signals for SLOW DOWN ! ! or GO FASTER ! ! or I HAFTA GO PEE ! ! etc. ? ? ? I 've never liked my passengers to try and shift their weight with the turns at all ... I find the weight shift can be very sudden and unnerving . It 's one thing if they 're just getting comfortable or decide to look over your other shoulder , but I do n't recommend having him/her shift her weight with each turn ... too violent . Also ( I think someone already said this ) make sure your passenger wears good gear . I sometimes choose to ride without a helmet or lacking other safety gear ( depends on how squidly I feel ) but I wo n't let passengers do it . What I do to myself I can handle , but I would n't want to hurt anyone else , so I do n't let them on without gloves , jacket , ( at least ) jeans , heavy boots , and a helmet that *fits* > I really want this to be a positive experience for us both , mainly so that > she 'll want to go with me again , so any help will be appreciated ... Go *real* easy . It 's amazing how solid a grip you have on the handle bars that your passenger does not . Do n't make her feel like she 's going to slide off the back , and `` snappy '' turns for you are sickening lurches for her . In general , it feels much less controlled and smooth as a passenger . I ca n't stand being on the back of my brother 's bike , and I ride aggressively when i ride and I know he's a good pilot ... still , everything feels very unsteady when you're a passenger . > Thanks , > -Bob- Show off by not showing off the first time out ... -- -- -- - '' This is where I wan na sit and buy you a drink someday .

The initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links . For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting Americans . Rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth , privacy and law enforcement , previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement . Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer . It is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files . While encryption technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information , it also can be used by terrorists , drug dealers , and other criminals . A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the `` Clipper Chip '' has been developed by government engineers . The chip represents a new approach to encryption technology . It can be used in new , relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone . It scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today . This new technology will help companies protect proprietary information , protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically . At the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal , state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals . A `` key-escrow '' system will be established to ensure that the '' Clipper Chip '' is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding Americans . Each device containing the chip will have two unique 2 '' keys , '' numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device . When the device is manufactured , the two keys will be deposited separately in two `` key-escrow '' data bases that will be established by the Attorney General . Access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap . The `` Clipper Chip '' technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans . To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology , the Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices . In addition , respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings . The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption 's dual-edge sword : encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry , but it also can shield criminals and terrorists . We need the `` Clipper Chip '' and other approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities . In order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches ( like the key-escrow system ) , the President has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates : -- the privacy of our citizens , including the need to employ voice or data encryption for business purposes ; -- the ability of authorized officials to access telephone calls and data , under proper court or other legal order , when necessary to protect our citizens ; -- the effective and timely use of the most modern technology to build the National Information Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and the competitiveness of American industry in the global marketplace ; and -- the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export high technology products . The President has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries , the Congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed . 3 The Administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a National Information Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to information . This infrastructure of high-speed networks ( `` information superhighways '' ) will transmit video , images , HDTV programming , and huge data files as easily as today 's telephone system transmits voice . Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure , the Federal Government must act quickly to develop consistent , comprehensive policies regarding its use . The Administration is committed to policies that protect all Americans ' right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law . Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet . The provisions of the President 's directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also available . For additional details , call Mat Heyman , National Institute of Standards and Technology , ( 301 ) 975-2758 . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S TELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE Q : Does this approach expand the authority of government agencies to listen in on phone conversations ? A : No . `` Clipper Chip '' technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans . Q : Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation encrypted using the device . What would they have to do to decipher the message ? A : They would have to obtain legal authorization , normally a court order , to do the wiretap in the first place . They would then present documentation of this authorization to the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug smugglers . The key is split into two parts , which are stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key escrow system . Q : Who will run the key-escrow data banks ? A : The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent entities . At this point , the Department of Justice and the Administration have yet to determine which agencies will oversee the key-escrow data banks . Q : How strong is the security in the device ? How can I be sure how strong the security is ? A : This system is more secure than many other voice encryption systems readily available today . While the algorithm will remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow system , we are willing to invite an independent panel of cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all potential users that there are no unrecognized vulnerabilities . Q : Whose decision was it to propose this product ? A : The National Security Council , the Justice Department , the Commerce Department , and other key agencies were involved in this decision . This approach has been endorsed by the President , the Vice President , and appropriate Cabinet officials . Q : Who was consulted ? The Congress ? Industry ? A : We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on encryption issues , and expect those discussions to intensify as we carry out our review of encryption policy . We have briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the decisions related to this initiative . Q : Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers ? A : The government designed and developed the key access encryption microcircuits , but it is not providing the microcircuits to product manufacturers . Product manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip manufacturer that produces them . Q : Who provides the `` Clipper Chip '' ? A : Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance , California , and will sell the chip to encryption device manufacturers . The programming function could be licensed to other vendors in the future . Q : How do I buy one of these encryption devices ? A : We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating the `` Clipper Chip '' into their devices . Q : If the Administration were unable to find a technological solution like the one proposed , would the Administration be willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more powerful encryption devices ? A : This is a fundamental policy question which will be considered during the broad policy review . The key escrow mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product that is more secure , more convenient , and less expensive than others readily available today , but it is just one piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to encryption technology , which the Administration is developing . The Administration is not saying , `` since encryption threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement , we will prohibit it outright '' ( as some countries have effectively done ) ; nor is the U.S. saying that `` every American , as a matter of right , is entitled to an unbreakable commercial encryption product . '' There is a false `` tension '' created in the assessment that this issue is an `` either-or '' proposition . Rather , both concerns can be , and in fact are , harmoniously balanced through a reasoned , balanced approach such as is proposed with the `` Clipper Chip '' and similar encryption techniques . Q : What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton Administration 's policy toward encryption will differ from that of the Bush Administration ? A : It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption technology in telecommunications and computing and are committed to working with industry and public-interest groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans' privacy , help businesses to compete , and ensure that law enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime and terrorism . Q : Will the devices be exportable ? Will other devices that use the government hardware ? A : Voice encryption devices are subject to export control requirements . Case-by-case review for each export is required to ensure appropriate use of these devices . The same is true for other encryption devices . One of the attractions of this technology is the protection it can give to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad . With this in mind , we expect export licenses will be granted on a case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these devices to secure their own communications abroad . We plan to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability of these products . -- Jim Gillogly Trewesday , 25 Astron S.R . 1993 , 17:01

Of course ; sorry for the misunderstanding . I was referring to the fact that far more aeronautical development took place in the '30 's . For much of the '20 's , the super-abundance of Jennies and OX-5 engines held down the industry . By 1926 , many of the obsolete WWI aircraft had been retired and Whirlwind had their power/weight ratio and reliability up to the point where long-distance flights became practical . It 's important to note that the Atlantic was flown not once but THREE times in 1927 : Lindbergh , Chamberlin and Levine , and Byrd 's _America_ . `` When it 's time to railroad , you railroad .

However , I will say that the most common arrangement in Prince Henry the Navigator 's Portugal was for the prince to put up part of the money and merchants to put up the rest .

The problem is that the amount of prize money required to inspire a Moon Base is much larger than any but a handful of individuals or corporations can even consider putting up . The Kremer Prizes ( human powered aircraft ) , Orteig 's prize , Lord Northcliffe 's prize for crossing the Atlantic ( won in 1919 by Alcock and Brown ) were MUCH smaller . The technologies required were within the reach of individual inventors , and the prize amounts were well within the reach of a large number of wealthy individuals . I think that only a gov't could afford to set up a $ 1B+ prize for any purpose whatsoever . Note that Burt Rutan suggested that NASP could be built most cheaply by taking out an ad in AvWeek stating that the first company to build a plane that could take off and fly the profile would be handed $ 3B , no questions asked . -- Keith Mancus < mancus @ butch.jsc.nasa.gov > | N5WVR < mancus @ sweetpea.jsc.nasa.gov > | `` Black powder and alcohol , when your states and cities fall , | when your back 's against the wall ... .

Whole blood numbers for humans tend to be somewhat lower ( roughly 5 to 10 percent lower ) . I find the following range for whole blood in FUNDAMENTALS OF CLINICAL CHEMISTRY : N. W. Teitz , editor ; W. B. Saunders , 1987 : Human glucose ( whole blood , fasting levels ) -- > 60 - 95 mg./dL . > Which are the strips calibrated for ? ( Obviously they measure whole blood ) Indeed , they do measure whole blood levels , although they are not as accurate as a serum test done in a laboratory . One problem is that cells in the sample continue to metabolize glucose after the sample is drawn , reducing the apparent level . According to Teitz , however , results compare `` reasonably well '' with laboratory results , although `` values below 80 mg./dL . tend to be lower with strip tests , whereas values above 240 mg./dL . can be very erratic . '' > What is the conversion factor between human plasma glucose and > whole blood ( pin prick ) glucose concentration ? As stated above , whole blood levels tend to be roughly 5 to 10 percent lower than serum levels . Sample freshness will affect whole blood levels , however . I do n't believe there is a well- defined `` conversion factor , '' since cell metabolism will affect samples to varying degrees . The serum/plasma test is much preferred for any except general `` ball park '' testing . -Rich Young ( These are not Kodak 's opinions . )

Is there a problem because I based my morality on something that COULD be wrong ? Gosh , there 's a heck of a lot of stuff that I believe that COULD be wrong , and that comes from sources that COULD be wrong . What do you base your belief on atheism on ?

From : simsh @ aix02.ecs.rpi.edu ( Hillel Y. Sims ) Subject : what size vram simm is this ? Nntp-Posting-Host : aix02.ecs.rpi.edu Lines : 20 Hi everyone . I recently posted about how I received a bad vram chip for my new LCIII , and someone responded that it may not actually be bad , but it may be a 512K LC vram chip , and thus does n't work properly with my computer . So I 'm wondering if anyone can interpret these codes for me , so I can figure out what type of chip MacConnection sent me . Each chip says : M518121A-80J 2515251 On the back of the card , it says 0593 I believe from the numbers that means it is an 80ns chip , but I ca n't figure out what the size is supposed to be . If anyone can help , I 'd be grateful . Please email me your response . Thanks a lot ! -- Hillel Sims -- -- - simsh @ rpi.edu -- -- - Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute '' Is rot13 rotated 13 forward or backward ? '' -- Anonymous

I 'm not interested in yet > another Catholic/Protestant argument , but if any Catholics can tell us > the basis for these beliefs , I think it would be appropriate . -- clh ] Again I find myself wanting to respond to a posting and having neither the time nor the proper materials with me ( you would think I would learn my lesson by now -- but I 'm trying to finish writing my Thesis and do n't have tons of time . Anyway ... ) The basis for our ( the catholic church 's ) belief in the assumption of Mary , body and soul , into heaven is that , to put it simply , the apostles and all the early generation Christians believed it . In fact , throughout their ministry the apostles kept in close contact with Mary , and 11 of the 12 were present when she died . Only Thomas was missing -- when he arrived several days later , he asked to be shown her body , and moved with pity , Peter and several of the other apostles brought him to her tomb . When they arrived the seal was still unbroken . They broke the seal , entered , and the body was missing . There was no sign that anyone had entered , forcibly or otherwise , and everything else was laid out exactly as it had been left . The apostles present all believed that Mary was assumed into heaven -- and the apostles TAUGHT this in their preaching ( of course , this does not appear in any of the texts currently considered part of the bible , but it does appear in other writings left behind by several of them . ) Basicaly , as an apostolic church ( ie . founded by the apostles ) , we believe that the teachings of the apostles , whether written down in the bible or written down in other sources , is true , providing that the authenticity of those other sources can be confirmed . At least in the case of the assumption of Mary , the authenticity is quite clear . Hope this helps -- I would welcome anyone who has more information to add to what I 've said . - Mike Walker mdw33310 @ uxa.cso.uiuc.edu ( Univ . of Illinois ) ]

From : 02106 @ ravel.udel.edu ( Samuel Ross ) Subject : Sams comic sale ! ! Low prices ! ! ! READ ! ! ! Nntp-Posting-Host : ravel.udel.edu Organization : University of Delaware Distribution : usa Lines : 375 OK . Instead of holding an auction , I have decided to compute prices for each comic ( after many suggestions ) . These are the most reasonable prices I can give ( not negotiable ) . If you would like to purchase a comic ( or group ) , simply email me with the title and issue # 's you want . The price for each issue is shown beside each comic . First come , first served ! ! ! There is no more bidding . Meet my price and it is yours . I can be reached at this email address : 02106 @ chopin.udel.edu or 02106 @ ravel.udel.edu or 02106 @ bach.udel.edu or 02106 @ brahms.udel.edu NO MORE HAGGLING ABOUT THE PRICE ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! LOTS OF COMICS FOR $ 1 , $ 2 , or $ 3 LOOK AT LIST ! ! ! ! ! Shipping is $ 2 for 1-3 comics . For more than 3 , the price will be determined by the volume of the purchase ( I may have to use a big heavy box for large orders which costs more to mail ) .

I do n't know about any `` originals '' . The person who was telling me about the Septuagint version said that the Greeks had a wonderful library in Alexandria that was full of manuscripts/scrolls and that it was burned soon after the Septuagint version was translated ( perhaps to conceal some changes in the different versions , or perhaps just as part of the typical burning of valuable things that occurs during changes in power groups , he/I dunno ) . > > So , I was just wondering , since I imagine some Jewish people somewhere must > > have had copies of the earlier Hebrew versions , is the Hebrew version of the > > Old Testament very different from the Greek derived version ? > No .

From : willis @ oracle.SCG.HAC.COM ( Stan Willis ) Subject : Series 1 , game 1 ; Kings 6 @ Flames 3 Reply-To : willis @ empire.dnet.hac.com ( Stan Willis ) Organization : none Lines : 269 1992-93 Los Angeles Kings notes and game reports . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Kings 6 @ Calgary Flames 3 - 04/18/93 The third place Kings opened the 1993 Stanley Cup Playoffs in Calgary , against the second place Flames and came out with an impressive 6-3 victory in front of a non-sellout crowd of 18,605 at the Saddledome in Calgary . Symthe Division playoff hockey this was . Both teams seemed a bit tense in the opening period though the Kings scored off the opening face-off . The Kings got into the flow of the game much earlier than the Flames as they played out- standing team defense . It took the Flames 9:45 of the first period to record their first shot on goal . The Kings , ranked 16th of the 16 playoff teams on penalty killing , shut down the Flames . The Flames went 0-8 on the power play and could record only 8 shot on goal in those 8 opportunities . The Kings had their problems on the power play , yet they did manager to score 2 goals in 10 tries . The Kings forwards back-checked while the defense stood the Flames up at the blue line , allowing the Kings to take took the home ice advantage away from the Flames . Rob Blake missed the game due to the lower back contusion but is ex- pected to be in the lineup on Wednesday . Wayne Gretzky suffered a charlie horse in his right leg . He took a few shifts in the second period before retiring to the dressing room for the rest of the game . Interviewed on the radio this morning , he stated that he was fine and would be in the lineup on Wednesday . 1st period : 1-0 . The Kings got things started right off the opening face-off . Gretzky won the draw with the puck going to Sydor . He crossed center ice and slapped the puck into the Flames zone and behind the net . The puck carried around to the far side where Robitaille wacked at it and the rebound bounced to Sandstrom . He put the puck behind the Flames net where Gretzky picked it up . Gretzky set up in 'his office ' , moved to the near side and passed into the near circle where Sydor had moved in . Sydor , who got the puck between the face-off dot and the hash mark , shot off the pass , beating Vernon low and between the legs . Millen and Fleury went off at 4:57 . Skrudland went off at 12:25 but the Kings failed to convert . Carson went off at 14:53 and the Flames failed to convert . Dahlquist went off at 18:34 and Dahl went off at 19:30 , giving the Kings a 30 second 5on3 which they failed to convert . The Kings recorded 2 goal posts in the period . 2nd period : The Kings opened with a 5on3 carried over from the 1st period which they failed to convert on . With 6 seconds left in the 5on4 , Vernon put a bouncing puck into the stands and received a delay of game . 1-1 . Calgary evened the score on the ensuing Kings power play . Kurri , with the puck in the neutral zone , tried to put the puck into the Flames zone but it hit the stick of Fleury and bounced to Suter at the Flames blue line . Suter skated down the near wing and into the Kings zone . He faked a shot at the circle and skated around Kurri . As he cut thorugh the crease , he got Hrudey to go with him and he put the puck behind Hrudey , on his stick side for a short hander . 2-1 . The Kings reclaimed the lead 25 seconds later on the same power play . Shuchuk , in the far circle passed to Sydor at the top of the slot and headed for the net . Sydors shot hit Shuchuk in the back and dropped into the low slot where 2 Kings ( Shuchuk and Granato ) were being checked by 3 Flames . Carson came from the far corner , picked up the loose puck and snapped a wrist shot between the legs of Vernon from 5 feet above the crease . 3-1 . The Kings widened their lead just 24 seconds later . Rychel was checked off the puck at the Flames blue line . Taylor picked up the puck and sent a pass cross the slot to Huddy . Huddy shot off the pass , from the near face-off dot , beating a diving Vernon on the glove side . 4-1 . 2:59 later , the Kings had a 3 goal lead . McSorley took a shot form the near point that hit a Flame and deflected towards the boards . Marty got his own rebound , skated to the bottom of the circle and sent a pass into the low slot that hit Dahlquist on the leg and deflected past the stick of Vernon . Skrudland went off at 10:53 but the Kings could not convert . Sydor went off at 12:35 and Watters went off at 14:40 , giving the Flames a 5 second 5-3 but they failed to convert . McSorley went off at 17:19 and the Flames had 3 consecutive power plays but the Flames killed it themselves when Suter went off for high sticking at 17:31 . Sandstrom went off at 18:03 to close out the period . The Kings hit 3 goal post in the period . 3rd period : The Kings used the phrase `` Initiate , not retaliate '' and it was very evident here in the 3rd period as the Kings continued to pound the body and the Flames continued to take bad penalties to take themselves out of the game . 5-1 . The Kings extended their lead to 4 goals at the 1:06 mark . The Kings shot the puck into the near corner of the Flames zone . Vernon went behind the net to cut off the puck but he could not control it . Donnelly , who was behind him , wacked at the puck , sending it into the low slot . As Vernon slid back in to the crease , Granato got a shot that hit a Flame and bounced to the left of the net where Millen fired the rebound behind Vernon . Sydor went off at 1:24 ; Nieuwendyk went off at 3:22 as the teams skated 4 on 4 . 5-2 . Otto , skating down the far side , stepped around McSorley , cut to the net and passed to Dahlquist in the low slot . Dahlquist cut through the top of the crease and put the puck in under a diving Hrudey . Carson and Rychel came in on a 2-1 . When Carson passed across to Rychel , Fleury tripped Rychel with no call . The puck got shoveled into the far corner where Fleury knocked Rychel down and checked him from behind into the boards , drawing a 5-minute major and a game misconduct at the 6:08 mark . Unfortunately , the Kings squandered the 5 minute power play when Granato ( at 6:44 ) and Watters ( at 8:19 ) took penalties . 5-3 . The Flames closed to within 2 at the 8:47 mark . MacInnis , at the near point , passed to Yawney at the far point . He took a few strides towards the net , wound up and drove a shot off the near post and in over the glove of Hrudey . The play started on another faceoff that the Kings lost . Timeout - LA . 6-3 . MacInnis took a penalty at 9:56 and the Kings converted on the power play to seal the victory . Sandstrom , skating down the far wing in the Flames zone cut towards the back of the net . Just as he crossed the goal line , he passed the puck into the low slot , on the far side , to Carson who shot off the pass , beating Vernon on the ice , stick side . At the 16:17 mark , Skrudland went off for slashing and Stern went crazy as he went after Shuchuk . Stern wound up with a double minor for roughing , a single minor for cross checking and a 10 minute misconduct , and he took the Flames right out of the game . On the plus side : The Kings , for the most part , played very disciplined hockey as they let Calgary retaliate . The Kings played good team defense and excellent penalty killing . On the minus side : The Kings lost almost every face-off . This must improve or the Flames will surely get that power play back on track . Notes : -- -- -- The Kings recalled Guy Leveque , Brandy Semchuk and Jim Thomson from Phoenix . Wayne Gretzkys 1st period assist was his 307th career playoff point . The Kings entered the game 24th in the league in shots per game against , giving the opposing team an average of 34.4 shots per game .

From : dgj2y @ kelvin.seas.Virginia.EDU ( David Glen Jacobowitz ) Subject : Dumb Question : Function Generator Originator : dgj2y @ kelvin.seas.Virginia.EDU Organization : University of Virginia Lines : 35 I have a new scope and I thought I 'd save a few bucks by buying one with a function generator built in . After having it awhile I noticed two things about the function generator . For one , there seems to be a bias even when the 'pull-offset ' is pushed in . That is , I have to pull that know and adjust it to get a signal sans some random 50mV bias . The other _really_ annoying thing is that the damn output wo n't go below about 1V p-p . I am a student ( you may have guessed from my previous posts ) , and I often have to measure the input impedances of various circuits I build.Many of the circuits have maximum input signals of way less than 500mV amplitude and most have input impedances in the 10 's of Kohm range . The thing is , in order to use my function generator I have to divide the voltage to some thing reasonable . Then , of course , to measurethe input impedance of my circuit I am going to have to throw in another resistor in series . With the 50ohm output of the generator I could just ignore it , but now with this little divider there I have to figure that in . It 's kind of a pain in the ass . Is there any way I could make myself a little box that could solve this little problem . The box would tkae the function generator input , lower the voltage and give an output impedance that is some low , unchanging number . I would want to lower the voltage by a factor of one hundred or so . I could just build a little buffer amp , but I'd like to have this box not be active . Any quick ideas . The scope 's not broken . For other reasons I had sent it to the shop to get repaired and they replaced it . The function generator was the same way on that one , too . please help as I am feeling very stupid today , dave dgj2y @ virginia.edu

Just trying to get this clear , so please bear with me . As far as I can tell , you 're proposing the following rules of engagement between Israel and the Palestinean resistance . Please feel revise this preliminary draft as necessary : 1 ) Israeli military personnel are fair game at any time , in uniform or out , on duty or off . In practice , since any male or female Israeli of military age ( 18- ? ) may be off-duty military , all but young children are acceptable targets . Since the existence of Israel constitutes indication of hostile intent , no further provocation is required . 2 ) To avoid inpermissable violations of the rights of non-combatant Palestineans , Israeli forces must not engage Palestineans without positive identification as military personnel , clear indication of aggressive intent , and a clear field of fire . a ) Positive identification may be assured by either checking for Palestinean military uniform , by posession of exclusively military armament ( ie , T78 MBTs or MiG-29 aircraft ) , or self-identification ( either verbal or documentary ) . Note that dual-use military/civilian weaponry such as hand grenades , AK-47 rifles , and RPG launchers do not constitute positive military identification and require closer inspection such as document checks . b ) Aggressive intent ( as distinct from merely 'hostile ' intent , which is the normal condition ) may be assured by not less than three rounds of incoming fire separated by intervals of not less than ten seconds between rounds . Note that a single burst of automatic-weapon fire counds as one round , as does a volley of rocket fire from more than one source . As noted above , dual-use weaponry may NOT be assumed to originate from military personnel , and thus do not justify armed response . c ) A clear field of fire can be guaranteed by making a positive military identification of all personnel in the target area of the weapons to be used . Note that aggressive intent need not be proven for all possible targets . Thus , if IAF aircraft are attacked by a SAM crew it is not necessary to check the papers of each crew member so long as none are obviously civilians ( as indicated , for instance , by the posession of uniquely civilian weaponry such as stones , axes , and Molotov coctails . ) Since it is often difficult for IAF elements to land and make the necessary checks , ground forces should first screen prospective strike areas before AGM fire . For ACM purposes , a cockpit-to-cockpit pass within 5 meters is usually sufficient for this purpose , but may be repeated if necessary . -- - D. C.

The ability to program was > an entry requirement . Try the 'M.Sc . Computing Science ' course at the REAL Newcastle University . It 's a conversion course , but at least they teach REAL programming . In the space of 9 months we were taught PASCAL , Simula , Prolog , Miranda . Also , some basic low level stuff ( 68000 ) was covered as well . They also did concurrent programming and operating systems , some software engineering , plus quite a few optional units , including database theory , and some stuff about comms . The PASCAL is to be replaced by C/C++ I think next year - I lear n't this ( and X Windows programming as well ) anyway via a good selection of project over the final three months - depending on your tastes , the selection of skills lear n't can be quite wide reaching . The one critiscism I would level at the course , which I would have thought invaluable , is the lack of an option to do the project period in industry - this would probably need a slightly longer project period ( say six months ) , but would enhance the prestige and usefulness of an already excellent and thorough course . Yes , I know this sounds like a plug for the course , why not ! Mackem Ian .

The Selke candidate forwards main purpose on a shift is to prevent goals from being scored- not to score them . When Lemieux or Gilmour play their number one purpose is to score- defence is secondary- especially considering the line that plays against them is probably a defensive one . That is why they are not Selke candidates . > > 2 .

Why are only those people in favor of the system to blame . If society accepts such a system , then each member of society is to blame when an innocent person gets executed . Those that are not in favor should work to convince others . And , most members of our society have accepted the blame -- they 've considered the risk to be acceptable . Similarly , every person who drives must accept the blame for fatal traffic accidents . This is something that is surely going to happen when so many people are driving . It is all a question of what risk is acceptable . It is much more likely that an innocent person will be killed driving than it is that one will be executed . keith

I can see the relationship between free throws awarded after a certain number of fouls , but it's obviously easier to score in basketball , there are more opportunities . If a basketball team scores 100 points , that's at least fifty chances made . The average number of shots taken by each team in a hockey game ( and this is a total guess ) is probably around 40 , and a team is lucky to capitalize on maybe 5 of them . You have some good ideas concerning the other penalties , but I think that a player should be awarded a penalty shot only when they had a chance to score and was interfered with . Also , later in the post , you talked about how boring the NBA game you attended was , that play was stopped too often . Would n't your penalty shot rule take up more time during a hockey game ?

Perhaps the reason is simple -- maybe the marketing people who put together the brochures and price lists were n't clear on the FPU issue . Afterall , Apple 's literature is not always 100 % correct . A funny one I noticed recently is that some of the brochures on the Macs with CD capability refer to the `` auto inkjet '' feature . This should have read `` auto inject '' feature ( as it does on some other correct brochures I 've seen from Apple ) . Since it was correct on some older brochures , I can only guess that someone edited the copy , saw `` inject '' and thought it was a typo and changed it to the more familiar word `` inkjet '' . Hmmm , what would that be ? A printer built into the CD player ? A way of *writing* information to a CD ? : - ) : - )

Can anybody name a player who was 'rushed ' to the majors ( let 's , for argument 's sake , define `` rushed '' as brought up to the majors for more than a cup of coffee prior at age 22 or younger , and performing below expectations ) , whose career was damaged by this rushing ? I 'm serious ; I tend to agree with David that bringing the player up sooner is better , but I 'd like to look at players for whom this theory did n't work , if there are any . I 'd prefer players within the last 10 years or so , because then I can look up their minor league stats . ( It 's important to distinguish between players who legitimately had careers below what their minor league numbers would have projected , as opposed to players who were hyped and failed , but actually had careers not out of line with their minor league numbers ) . Let 's kick it off with an example of a player who was `` rushed '' , although there does n't seem to have been any damage to his career . Jay Bell was given 135 PAs in the major leagues at age 21 , and performed well below what you would expect from his AAA numbers the same season . He got 236 PAs the next year at age 22 , and still underperformed . However , the next year , at age 24 , his performance improved , and he won the everyday shortstop job , and has been there ever since . It 's really hard for me to see where he would have been better off staying in the minor league ( where he was performed quite well in AAA ) during this time , rather than being `` rushed '' ; Cleveland might have been better off , I suppose , because they might have been less likely to give up on him . Yes , if you bring a player up early , he 's likely going to struggle . But does that delay the time at which he stops struggling , and starts performing up to expectations ?

Anyone else catch ESPN 's piece about prospects and the relationship between age , career length , MVPs and Hall of Fame members ? It was part of their preseason special . Basically , they looked at players that had amassed 1000 plate appearances ( or ABs ) by the time they were 24 , and noticed some interesting things . For starters , they found out such players comprised the majority of MVPs in the history of the game . They also found out such players represented the majority of the players in the hall of fame . The kicker , though , was that they actually did some number-crunching and found that such players ' careers lasted much longer than the careers of players not in that group . They also found that these players produced at both a greater level of performance and produced over twice the raw totals ( HRs , etc ) of the other players . The first group outhit the second something like .282 to .260 in raw BA , and blew away the second group in such categories as HRs , 2Bs , RBIs , etc .

First , my above statement doesnot say that `` the existence of israeli citizens in the WB revoke their right of life '' but it says `` the israeli occupation of the WB revoke the right of life for some/most its citizens - basically revokes the right of for its military men '' . Clearly , occupation is an undeclared war ; during war , attacks against military targets are fully legitimate . Ok , let me re-phrase the question . I have repeatedly asked you if the Israelis have less human rights than the palestinians , and if so , why . From your posting ( where you did not directly adress my question ) I inferred that you thought so . Together with the above statement I then assumed that the reason was the actions of the state of Israel . Re : your statement of occupation : I 'd like you to define the term , so I do n't have to repeat this 'drag the answer out of hasan ' procedure more than neccesary . Secondly , surely israeli have human rights , but they ask their goverment to protect it by withdrawing from the occupied terretories , not by further oppressing Palestinean human rights . I 'm sorry , but the above sentence does not make sense . Please rephrase it . | > If a state can deprive all it 's citizens of human rights by its actions , then | > tell me why _any_ human living today should have any rights at all ?

From : vzhivov @ superior.carleton.ca ( Vladimir Zhivov ) Subject : Flames Truly Brutal in Loss Organization : Carleton University Lines : 28 As the subject suggests the Flames were not impressive this afternoon , dropping a 6-3 decision to the LA Kings . Most of the Flames neglected to show up , especially in their own zone , as the Kings hit at least five posts ! The Flames best line was probably Skrudland-Paslawski-Berube ( which tells how bad the Flames were ) . Gary Suter scored a great goal ( in fact all three Flame goals were scored by D-men - Yawney and Dahlquist getting the others ) , but also made some bonehead plays . For the Kings , Pat Conacher was especially impressive . The games was VERY chippy , as Dan Mirouelli lost control early and never recovered it ; there were high-sticks , cross-checks , punches , hits from behind . Fleury got a game misconduct for rubbing out Warren Rychel from behind . Flames dominated the game physically , but failed to take advantage due to horrendous defensive lapses ( I do n't think Vernon can be blamed for any of the goals ) . Calgary went with 7 D-men , as Roger Johansson played LW ; he looked lost IMHO - I hope King inserts Chris Lindbergh , Paul Kruse , or Sergei Makarov for Wednesday's game . Gretzky left the game in the 2nd period with a charley-horse ; no idea how serious - he did n't return . I still think the Flames should win this series , but they better buckle down . - Vlad the Impaler

The `` used to kill '' is the heart of the misinformation . It 's one of those technically accurate phrasings that conveys the wrong impression . What Mr. Quiqley is more than aware of , I 'm sure , is that when people read this they think violent arguments where one member of the family grabs a gun and shoots another , thereby creating a tragic situation which could easily have been avoided had the gun not been there , or a tragic accident , especially involving a child . Unfortunately , that 's not the way things stack up . The majority of that 43 `` times '' ( 37 I believe ) are suicides . That is , someone intentionally took a firearm and shot themselves intending to kill themselves . And why it 's popular to try and blame suicides on guns , the evidence does n't support this . Internal studies , as well as comparative studies with other countries , indicate that cultural factors far outweigh whether a person will kill themselves or not . ( Japan , for instance , has a slightly higher rate than the U.S . There people jump off buildings . ) According to the National Crime Survey , 40 % of violent crime is commited by `` non-strangers , '' which mistakenly has been generalized regarding the King County study to mean , `` Friends and family . '' That is , Mr. Quigley , and others who quote this statistic , are banking on the mental image that a `` Friend , family member , or child , '' equates to a loving relationship , and that it was cut short in a moment of anger . Unfortunately , all too often husbands beat and kill wives , children assault parents , or vice-versa . Most rapes are commited by someone known to the victim , for instance . Essentially , that a gun was used against a `` friend '' or family member does n't mean they were n't trying to hurt the other person . Crime is highest among poor urban families , and those are also the areas most `` at risk '' for family problems , especially violent ones . A son in a gang may not be as loving toward his parents if they disapprove than a suburban kid might . Finally , it hinges on the fallacy that a dead intruder is the only value of a self-defense firearm . Using the minimum figures I worked out using the NCS I got about an 80:1 ratio between deadly self-defenses ( justifiable homicides ) and with-gun self-defenses . Between the FBI Uniform Crime report and the NCS there 's an enormous amount of data and anybody with the calculator can crunch the numbers . As such it is incorrect to assume that a dead body is the only valid means of determining the success of such a defense , since according to the NCS ( which has been considered by many to seriously under-report defenses ) there were far more successful with-gun defenses than intruders killed . Not it also confines itself to the home , where attack by a `` friend or family member '' is far , far more likely , and excludes any defense which occurs outside the home . ( I believe a large number occur in businesses . ) > Studies by the > Western Psychiatric Institute , in Pittsburgh , found that the mere presence > of a gun in the home sharply incresases the likelihood a family member > will commit suicide , even in the absence of psychiatric illness . '' I have not seen the exact data for this , so I ca n't comment . I will point out Canada 's and Japan 's suicide rate as indications that culture far more than firearm availability affect suicide rates . There was also a comparative study between Canada ( for what it 's worth , considering the difficulty of comparing across cultural lines ) published in the New England Journal of Medicine ( I can get the exact cite if you need it ) that concluded that restrictive firearm laws would not significantly impact the over-all suicide rate . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- David Veal Univ . of Tenn.

Unfortunately , while SGI systems were used to create the special effects for both Terminator 2 and Lawnmower Man , those are film-quality computer graphics , rendered in software and written to film a frame at a time . Each frame of computer animation for those films took hours to render on high-end parallel processing computer systems . Thus , that level of graphics would be difficult , if not impossible , to acheive in real time ( 30 frames per second ) . | > | > We certainly want to know more about VR . Who are the leading | > companies , | > agencies , universities ? What machines support VR ( i.e . SGI , Sun4 , | > HP-9000 , BIM-6000 , etc. ) ? It depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is . True immersive visualization ( VR ) , requires the rendering of complex visual databases at anywhere from 20 to 60 newly rendered frames per second . This is a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot training . If the frame rate is too low , the user notices the stepping of the frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene , so the motion of the graphics is not smooth and contiguous . Thus the graphics system must be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex data representations . Additionally , the frame rate must be constant . If the system renders 15 frames per second at one point , then 60 frames per second the next ( perhaps due to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was visible before ) , the user can get heavily distracted by the medium ( the graphics computer ) rather than focusing on the data . To maintain a constant frame rate , the system must be able to run in real-time . UNIX in general does not support real-time operation , but Silicon Graphics has modified the UNIX kernel for its multi-processor systems to be able to support real-time operation , bypassing the usual UNIX process priority-management schemes . Uniprocessor systems running UNIX can not fundamentally support real-time operation ( not Sun SPARC10 , not HP 700 Series systems , not IBM RS-6000 , not even SGI 's uniprocessor systems like Indigo or Crimson ) . Only our multiprocessor Onyx and Challenge systems support real-time operation due to their Symmetric Multi-Processing ( SMP ) shared-memory architecture . From a graphics perspective , rendering complex virtual environments requires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real-time multi-sample anti-aliasing . Of all of the general purpose graphics systems on the market today , only Crimson RealityEngine and Onyx RealityEngine2 systems fully support these capabilities . The anti-aliasing is particularly important , as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is an unfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment . | > What kind of graphics languages are used with VR | > ( GL , opengl , Phigs , PEX , GKS , etc. ) ?

Well Bill , There are 2MB soldered on the logic board and 2MB in the RAM expansion slot giving you 4MB . The only thing you can do to upgrade to the maximum Ram is to remove the 2MB expansion and install a 6MB expansion , giving you a total of 8MB which is the max on a 170 ... .You can try calling TechWorks , or any other memory vendors out of MacWeek , MacWorld ... etc ... . < ==================================+================================== > Peter Haase + Internet : haase @ meediv.lanl.gov Network Manager + Los Alamos National Laboratory

Organization : The Internet Lines : 30 NNTP-Posting-Host : enterpoop.mit.edu To : visual.com ! dbl @ cs.utexas.edu Cc : expo.lcs.mit.edu ! xpert @ cs.utexas.edu ... let me point out that both GUI-based word-processors and text-based formatters both have a language ; one happens to be mouse- and action-based , and the other symbol-based . True , but that 's beside the point . This is a fact about an abstract model of what the GUI users are doing , not about what they actually *are* doing . This abstract model is only apparent from the perpective of a *programmer* of the system . ( NB : some users may see it , too , but only when they put aside the work at hand and start thinking like a programmer . ) I 'm not saying that the programmer 's perspective is evil or stunted . After all , that 's what I do , too ! I am saying that UI designers must carefully distinguish between the user/programmer conceptual models , and they must ultimately serve the user of the system , not the builder of the system . I do n't recall the actual stats , but something like 1 in 5 people can be categorized as a `` symbol manipulator '' . It would be interesting to know more about the meaning and basis for this claim . At any rate , I do n't think this is evidence that 20 % of users think like programmers . Bankers , financial analysts , structural engineers -- - these are all people whose work you could characterize as primarily symbol manipulation . But what they do is not programming , and programming is not required to do what they do . To restate my previous point : yes , users want to build their own solutions ; no , they do not want to do programming to accomplish this .

From : mangoe @ cs.umd.edu ( Charley Wingate ) Subject : Re : Was Jesus Black ? Lines : 45 This subject seems to be incredibly inflammatory . Those who subscribe to _Biblical Archaeology Review_ will remember a spectacular letter battle set off when someone complained about a Franklin Mint ad . ( _BAR_ is a great magazine , but the contrast between the rather scholarly articles and the incredibly sleazy ads is extreme . ) In this ad , they were hawking a doll with a head based on the famous bust of Nefertiti , giving the face a typical doll-pink complexion . The letter complained about this as a misrepresentation on the grounds that Nefertiti was `` a beautiful black queen . '' This set off an exchange of hotheaded letters than ran for several issues , to the point where they had an article from an Egyptologist titled `` Was Cleopatra Black ? '' ( The answer to the title is `` no '' -- she was greek . ) I have to say that I hear a hysterical note in much of the complaining . I personally have seen only one blond-haired Jesus ( in the National Shrine in Wash. DC ) , and I found it very jarring . Western representations vary enourmously , but in general the image of is of a youngish male with dark hair and beard , of a sort that can be found ( modulo the nose ) all up and down the Mediterranean . ( Also , if what I remember is correct , the `` Black Madonna '' does n't represent a person with negroid features . It is black because of an accident . Joe Buehler ... . ? ) In the presence of all those marble statues , one is prone to forget that greeks are rather likely to have black hair . When one crosses the bosporus , the situation breaks down completely . Are Turks white ? How about Persians , or various groups in the indian subcontinent ? Was Gandhi white ? How about the Arabs ? Or picture Nassar and Sadat standing side by side . And then there are the Ethiopians ... . Those of a white racist bent are not likely to say that *any* of these people are `` white '' ( i.e. , of the racist 's `` race '' ) . If I may risk a potentially inflammatory remark , one undercurrent of this seems to be the identification of modern jews as members of the oppressor race . Considering the extreme dicotomy between medieval religion on the one hand and medieval antisemitism on the other , I do n't think that this `` Jesus was white '' thesis ever played the roles that some hold it did . Representations of Jesus as black or korean or whatever are fine . It seems awfully self-serving to insist that Jesus belongs to one 's own racial group . -- C.

Will , there has been a lot of discussion going on about this over in s.r.c.b-s . I will make the case here though and try to help you out : 8 For by grace are ye saved through faith ; and that not of yourselves : it is the gift of God : 9 Not of works , lest any man should boast . ( Ephesians 2:8-9 ) . Yes , it is by God 's grace and our faith that we are saved . We are not saved by what we do . However , 15 If ye love me , keep my commandments . ( John 14:15 ) . Keeping Christ 's commandments is a `` work '' per se , and a demonstration of our love for him . Also , 6 He spake also this parable ; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard ; and he came and sought fruit thereon , and found none . 7 Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard , Behold , these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree , and find none : cut it down ; why cumbereth it the ground ? 8 And he answering said unto him , Lord , let it alone this year also , till I shall dig about it , and dung it : 9 And if it bear fruit , well : and if not , then after that thou shalt cut it down . ( Luke 13:6-9 ) . Again , 16 Ye have not chosen me , but I have chosen you , and ordained you , that ye should go and bring forth fruit , and that your fruit should remain : that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name , he may give it you . ( John 15:16 ) . It is clear from these verses that we are called to bring forth fruit . What is that fruit . Well , Paul speaks of the fruit of the spirit being love , joy , peace , patience , etc . All of these are things that are manifest in the actions that we carry out . If a person claims to believe in Jesus Christ , but does not do the things Christ commanded , I dare say , that they really do n't have any faith . Asking which is more important , faith or works , is like asking which blade on a pair of scissors is most important or like asking which leg of your pants is more important . Good works should come out of and be a result of our faith . To have faith , true faith in Christ requires you to do what he commands . The parable above speaks allegorically of a person who does bear no fruit . Christs commands are actions , and if we do n't do those actions and produce fruit , then we shall be uprooted just like the tree . It is a dead and useless faith which has no action behind it . Actions prove our faith and show the genuineness of it . I can sit and talk for days about the fact that I have so much faith in my ability to jump off a building and not hit the ground . In other words , I can sit and tell you all day long that I have faith in my ability to fly . I really do n't have that faith though unless I am willing to jump off the roof and take the test . Words and talk mean nothing . I could go on and give more scriptures and if people want me to I will , but this should be sufficient . Hope it helped .

Note : The Macintosh LC supplies signals capable of driving TTL level inputs . However , some low impedance input VGA monitors do not work with the Macintosh LC .

That is , ignoring concerns about government intrusions into individual privacy , is the value of easy wiretaps to investigators greater than the cost to the communications industry , and their customers , to support this wiretap technology ? A rough estimate suggests that wiretaps are worth about five million dollars per year to U.S. law enforcement agencies . ( In 1990 , 872 U.S. wiretaps led to 2057 arrests , while total police expenditures of $ 28 billion led to 11.25 million arrests [ ref US Statistical Abstracts ] . ) I 'm working on estimating this wiretap benefit more accurately , but I 'd like to ask hardware experts out there to help me with estimating the costs of the new proposed wiretap technology . Please send me quotable/citeable estimates for : - How many chips which would need to be made per year to keep all phones with wiretap chips ? - How much would it cost to make each chip ? - How much did it cost to develop this technology in the first place ? - How much more would supporting hardware , people , etc . cost , per chip ? - What percentage cheaper would encryption chips and support have been if private enterprise could compete to meet customer encryption needs ? - What percentage of phone traffic would be taken up by the proposed `` law enforcement blocks '' ? - What is the total cost of handling all phone traffic per year ? Put another way , the question I 'm asking is , what if each police agency that wanted a particular wiretap had to pay for it , being charged their share of the full social cost of forcing communication to be wiretap compatible ? Would they choose to buy such wiretaps , or would they find it more cost-effective to instead investigate crimes in other ways ? -- Robin Hanson hanson @ ptolemy.arc.nasa.gov 415-604-3361 MS-269-2 , NASA Ames Research Center , Moffett Field , CA 94035 510-651-7483 47164 Male Terrace , Fremont , CA 94539-7921

Although some books demonstrate that the current implementation of Xt happens to call callback procedures in the order in which they are registered , the specification does not guarantee such a sequence , and supplemental authoritative documents ( i.e . the Asente/Swick volume ) do say that the order is undefined . Because the callback list can be manipulated by both the widget and the application , Xt can not guarantee the order of execution . In general , the callback procedures should be thought of as operating independently of one another and should not depend on side-effects of other callbacks operating ; if a seqence is needed , then the single callback to be registered can explicitly call other functions necessary .

It is possible to have code which looks like this trivial callback , which has a clear flow of control . The calls to AskUser ( ) block until answer is set to one of the valid values . If it is not a `` yes '' answer , the code drops out of the callback and back to an event-processing loop : void quit ( Widget w , XtPointer client , XtPointer call ) { int answer ; answer = AskUser ( w , `` Really Quit ? `` ) ; if ( RET_YES == answer ) { answer = AskUser ( w , `` Are You Really Positive ? `` ) ; if ( RET_YES == answer ) exit ( 0 ) ; } } A more realistic example might ask whether to create a file or whether to overwrite it . This is accomplished by entering a second event-processing loop and waiting until the user answers the question ; the answer is returned to the calling function . That function AskUser ( ) looks something like this , where the Motif can be replaced with widget-set-specific code to create some sort of dialog-box displaying the question string and buttons for `` OK '' , `` Cancel '' and '' Help '' or equivalents : int AskUser ( w , string ) Widget w ; char *string ; { int answer=RET_NONE ; /* some not-used marker */ Widget dialog ; /* could cache & carry , but ... */ Arg args [ 3 ] ; int n = 0 ; XtAppContext context ; n=0 ; XtSetArg ( args [ n ] , XmNmessageString , XmStringCreateLtoR ( string , XmSTRING_DEFAULT_CHARSET ) ) ; n++ ; XtSetArg ( args [ n ] , XmNdialogStyle , XmDIALOG_APPLICATION_MODAL ) ; n++ ; dialog = XmCreateQuestionDialog ( XtParent ( w ) , string , args , n ) ; XtAddCallback ( dialog , XmNokCallback , response , & answer ) ; XtAddCallback ( dialog , XmNcancelCallback , response , & answer ) ; XtAddCallback ( dialog , XmNhelpCallback , response , & answer ) ; XtManageChild ( dialog ) ; context = XtWidgetToApplicationContext ( w ) ; while ( answer == RET_NONE || XtAppPending ( context ) ) { XtAppProcessEvent ( context , XtIMAll ) ; } XtDestroyWidget ( dialog ) ; /* blow away the dialog box and shell */ return answer ; } The dialog supports three buttons , which are set to call the same function when tickled by the user . The variable answer is set when the user finally selects one of those choices : void response ( w , client , call ) Widget w ; XtPointer client ; XtPointer call ; { int *answer = ( int * ) client ; XmAnyCallbackStruct *reason = ( XmAnyCallbackStruct * ) call ; switch ( reason- > reason ) { case XmCR_OK : *answer = RET_YES ; /* some # define value */ break ; case XmCR_CANCEL : *answer = RET_NO ; break ; case XmCR_HELP : *answer = RET_HELP ; break ; default : return ; } } and the code unwraps back to the point at which an answer was needed and continues from there .

A number of programs offer X modes but otherwise run in a straight character-only mode . The easiest way for an application to determine that it is running on an X display is to attempt to open a connection to the X server : display = XOpenDisplay ( display_name ) ; if ( display ) { do X stuff } else { do curses or something else } where display_name is either the string specified on the command-line following -display , by convention , or otherwise is ( char* ) NULL [ in which case XOpenDisplay uses the value of $ DISPLAY , if set ] .

Is it necessary to call XDefineCursor ( ) for every window in my application ? The easiest thing to do is to create a single InputOnly window that is as large as the largest possible screen ; make it a child of your toplevel window and it will be clipped to that window , so it wo n't affect any other application . ( It needs to be as big as the largest possible screen in case the user enlarges the window while it is busy or moves elsewhere within a virtual desktop . ) Substitute `` toplevel '' with your top-most widget here ( similar code should work for Xlib-only applications ; just use your top Window ) : unsigned long valuemask ; XSetWindowAttributes attributes ; /* Ignore device events while the busy cursor is displayed . */ valuemask = CWDontPropagate | CWCursor ; attributes.do_not_propagate_mask = ( KeyPressMask | KeyReleaseMask | ButtonPressMask | ButtonReleaseMask | PointerMotionMask ) ; attributes.cursor = XCreateFontCursor ( XtDisplay ( toplevel ) , XC_watch ) ; /* The window will be as big as the display screen , and clipped by its own parent window , so we never have to worry about resizing */ XCreateWindow ( XtDisplay ( toplevel ) , XtWindow ( toplevel ) , 0 , 0 , 65535 , 65535 , ( unsigned int ) 0 , 0 , InputOnly , CopyFromParent , valuemask , & attributes ) ; where the maximum size above could be replaced by the real size of the screen , particularly to avoid servers which have problems with windows larger than 32767 . When you want to use this busy cursor , map and raise this window ; to go back to normal , unmap it . This will automatically keep you from getting extra mouse events ; depending on precisely how the window manager works , it may or may not have a similar effect on keystrokes as well . In addition , note also that most of the Xaw widgets support an XtNcursor resource which can be temporarily reset , should you merely wish to change the cursor without blocking pointer events .

What you need to do is fork ; then , immediately , in the child process , close ( ConnectionNumber ( XtDisplay ( widget ) ) ) ; to close the file-descriptor in the display information .

No . Xlib and Xt have no mutual exclusion for protecting critical sections . If your signal handler makes such a call at the wrong time ( which might be while the function you are calling is already executing ) , it can leave the library in an inconsistent state . Note that the ANSI C standard points out that behavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls any function other than signal ( ) itself , so this is not a problem specific to Xlib and Xt ; the POSIX specification mentions other functions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed that these functions are called by Xlib or Xt functions . You can work around the problem by setting a flag in the interrupt handler and later checking it with a work procedure or a timer event which has previously been added . Note : the article in The X Journal 1:4 and the example in O'Reilly Volume 6 are in error .

It 's very common to need to write an Xt program that can accept input both from a user via the X connection and from some other file descriptor , but which operates efficiently and without blocking on either the X connection or the other file descriptor . A solution is use XtAppAddInput ( ) . After you open your file descriptor , use XtAppAddInput ( ) to register an input handler . The input handler will be called every time there is something on the file descriptor requiring your program 's attention . Write the input handler like you would any other Xt callback , so it does its work quickly and returns . It is important to use only non-blocking I/O system calls in your input handlers . Most input handlers read the file descriptor , although you can have an input handler write or handle exception conditions if you wish . Be careful when you register an input handler to read from a disk file . You will find that the function is called even when there is n't input pending . XtAppAddInput ( ) is actually working as it is supposed to . The input handler is called whenever the file descriptor is READY to be read , not only when there is new data to be read . A disk file ( unlike a pipe or socket ) is almost always ready to be read , however , if only because you can spin back to the beginning and read data you 've read before . The result is that your function will almost always be called every time around XtAppMainLoop ( ) . There is a way to get the type of interaction you are expecting ; add this line to the beginning of your function to test whether there is new data : if ( ioctl ( fd , FIONREAD , & n ) == -1 || n == 0 ) return ; But , because this is called frequently , your application is effectively in a busy-wait ; you may be better off not using XtAppAddInput ( ) and instead setting a timer and in the timer procedure checking the file for input .

You can do this using XSendEvent ( ) ; it 's likely that you 're not setting the window field in the event , which Xt needs in order to match to the widget which should receive the event . If you 're sending events to your own application , then you can use XtDispatchEvent ( ) instead . This is more efficient than XSendEvent ( ) in that you avoid a round-trip to the server .

You are right to map the window before drawing into it . However , the window is not ready to be drawn into until it actually appears on the screen -- until your application receives an Expose event . Drawing done before that will generally not appear .

Note : the code uses BlackPixel and WhitePixel to avoid assuming that 1 is black and 0 is white or vice-versa . The relationship between pixels 0 and 1 and the colors black and white is implementation-dependent . They may be reversed , or they may not even correspond to black and white at all . Also note that actually using BlackPixel and WhitePixel is usually the wrong thing to do in a finished program , as it ignores the user 's preference for foreground and background . And also note that you can run into the same situation in an Xt-based program if you draw into the XtWindow ( w ) right after it has been realized ; it may not yet have appeared . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Subject : 135 ) What is the difference between a Screen and a screen ? The 'Screen ' is an Xlib structure which includes the information about one of the monitors or virtual monitors which a single X display supports . A server can support several independent screens . They are numbered unix:0.0 , unix:0.1 , unix:0.2 , etc ; the 'screen ' or 'screen_number ' is the second digit -- the 0 , 1 , 2 which can be thought of as an index into the array of available Screens on this particular Display connection . The macros which you can use to obtain information about the particular Screen on which your application is running typically have two forms -- one which takes a Screen and one with takes both the Display and the screen_number . In Xt-based programs , you typically use XtScreen ( widget ) to determine the Screen on which your application is running , if it uses a single screen . ( Part of the confusion may arise from the fact that some of the macros which return characteristics of the Screen have `` Display '' in the names -- XDisplayWidth , XDisplayHeight , etc . ) -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Subject : 136 ) Can I use C++ with X11 ?

No . Once set , the background pixel or pixmap of a window can not be re-read by clients . The reason for this is that a client can create a pixmap , set it to be the background pixmap of a window , and then free the pixmap . The window keeps this background , but the pixmap itself is destroyed . If you 're sure a window has a background pixel ( not a pixmap ) , you can use XClearArea ( ) to clear a region to the background color and then use XGetImage ( ) to read back that pixel . However , this action alters the contents of the window , and it suffers from race conditions with exposures . [ courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD and Stuart Marks of Sun ] Note that the same applies to the border pixel/pixmap . This is a ( mis ) feature of the protocol which allows the server is free to manipulate the pixel/pixmap however it wants . By not requiring the server to keep the original pixel or pixmap , some ( potentially a lot of ) space can be saved .

A completely transparent window is easy to get -- use an InputOnly window . In order to create a window which is *mostly* transparent , you have several choices : - the SHAPE extension first released with X11R4 offers an easy way to make non-rectangular windows , so you can set the shape of the window to fit the areas where the window should be nontransparent ; however , not all servers support the extension . - a machine-specific method of implementing transparent windows for particular servers is to use an overlay plane supported by the hardware . Note that there is no X notion of a `` transparent color index '' . - a generally portable solution is to use a large number of tiny windows , but this makes operating on the application as a unit difficult . - a final answer is to consider whether you really need a transparent window or if you would be satisfied with being able to overlay your application window with information ; if so , you can draw into separate bitplanes in colors that will appear properly .

When using GXxor you may expect that drawing with a value of black on a background of black , for example , should produce white . However , the drawing operation does not work on RGB values but on colormap indices . The color that the resulting colormap index actually points to is undefined and visually random unless you have actually filled it in yourself . [ On many X servers Black and White often 0/1 or 1/0 ; programs taking advantage of this mathematical coincidence will break . ] If you want to be combining colors with GXxor , then you should be allocating a number of your own color cells and filling them with your chosen pre-computed values . If you want to use GXxor simply to switch between two colors , then you can take the shortcut of setting the background color in the GC ( graphics context ) to 0 and the foreground color to a value such that when it draws over red , say , the result is blue , and when it draws over blue the result is red . This foreground value is itself the XOR of the colormap indices of red and blue .

The initial contents of pixmaps are undefined . This means that most servers will allocate the memory and leave around whatever happens to be there -- which is usually garbage .

My program has the ID of a window on a remote display . I want to check whether the window exists before doing anything with it . Because X is asynchronous , there is n't a guarantee that the window would still exist between the time that you got the ID and the time you sent an event to the window or otherwise manipulated it . What you should do is send the event without checking , but install an error handler to catch any BadWindow errors , which would indicate that the window no longer exists . This scheme will work except on the [ rare ] occasion that the original window has been destroyed and its ID reallocated to another window .

Yes . The X server assigns IDs to windows and other resources ( actually , the server assigns some bits , the client others ) , and any application that knows the ID can manipulate the resource [ almost any X server resource , except for GCs and private color cells , can be shared ] . The problem you face is how to disseminate the window ID to multiple applications . A simple way to handle this ( and which solves the problem of the applications ' running on different machines ) is in the first application to create a specially-named property on the root-window and put the window ID into it . The second application then retrieves the property , whose name it also knows , and then can draw whatever it wants into the window . [ Note : this scheme works iff there is only one instance of the first application running , and the scheme is subject to the limitations mentioned in the Question about using window IDs on remote displays . ] Note also that you will still need to coordinate any higher-level cooperation among your applications . Note also that two processes can share a window but should not try to use the same server connection . If one process is a child of the other , it should close down the connection to the server and open its own connection .

The only sure way to have your window appear on the top of the stack is to make the window override-redirect ; this means that you are temporarily assuming window-management duties while the window is up , so you want to do this infrequently and then only for short periods of time ( e.g . for popup menus or other short parameter-setting windows ) .

Users of Xt have the support of the translation manager to help get notification of double-clicking . There is no good way to get only a double-click in Xlib , because the protocol does not provide enough support to do double-clicks . You have to do client-side timeouts , unless the single-click action is such that you can defer actually taking it until you next see an event from the server . Thus , you have to do timeouts , which means system-dependent code . On most UNIXish implementations , you can use XConnectionNumber to get the file descriptor of the X connection and then use select ( ) or something similar on that . Note that many user-interface references suggest that a double-click be used to extend the action indicated by a single-click ; if this is the case in your interface then you can execute the first action and as a compromise check the timestamp on the second event to determine whether it , too , should be the single-click action or the double-click action .

How do I render rotated text ? Xlib intentionally does not provide such sophisticated graphics capabilities , leaving them up to server-extensions or clients-side graphics libraries . Your only choice , if you want to stay within the core X protocol , is to render the text into a pixmap , read it back via XGetImage ( ) , rotate it `` by hand '' with whatever matrices you want , and put it back to the server via XPutImage ( ) ; more specifically : 1 ) create a bitmap B and write your text to it . 2 ) create an XYBitmap image I from B ( via XGetImage ) . 3 ) create an XYBitmap Image I2 big enough to handle the transformation . 4 ) for each x , y in I2 , I2 ( x , y ) = I ( a , b ) where a = x * cos ( theta ) - y * sin ( theta ) b = x * sin ( theta ) + y * cos ( theta ) 5 ) render I2 Note that you should be careful how you implement this not to lose bits ; an algorithm based on shear transformations may in fact be better . The high-level server-extensions and graphics packages available for X also permit rendering of rotated text : Display PostScript , PEX , PHiGS , and GKS , although most are not capable of arbitrary rotation and probably do not use the same fonts that would be found on a printer . In addition , if you have enough access to the server to install a font on it , you can create a font which consists of letters rotated at some predefined angle . Your application can then itself figure out placement of each glyph .

Perhaps it is because witnesses who have left the compound have all testified that the BATF shot first , they they did not identify themselves before tossing in concussion grenades ( not that anyone inside could have _heard_ such identification after being near a concussion grenade ) and the announcement from the BATF that they have sealed the warrant under which they were operating - which was a _search_ warrant , by the way , _not_ an arrest warrant . In short , perhaps because the BATF is wildly out of control and perhaps calmer heads have realized that bombing a compound full of woman and children will not improve their position . There is a real chance that Koresh will be able to prove self-defense in court . That will leave - what ? - four officers dead and no one to blame but the BATF . Followups directed to alt.activism , where the discussion has raged nearly as long as the seige , and which shows every sign of not giving up nearly as soon .

Should a total amatuer ( like myslef ) be able to perform a motherboard swap without the aid of a technician , or is it beyond hope ? 4th ...

Scott ) writes : > > [ ... picking nits over tanks firing the main gun or not deleted ... ] > I think the point is being missed - that it is apparantly acceptable for Big Government ( Big Brother ? ) to use TANKS to control the people , as long as they do n't use the BIG GUN ( but everything else is allright ... ) . Tanks deployed against civilians , let alone FIRING on them with crew served weaponry ( a .50 Heavy Machine Gun is crew-served ) is something both our press and government howl about instantly when done in some other country . Against civilians that have , at most , one-shot-at-a-time LIGHT small arms . Certainly nothing that places the people in or behind the tank in any real danger . Molotov coctails ? A round from a rifle or pistol deals with anybody approaching with one of those . And `` snipers '' too often turn out to be strays from other cops/guard/army gunfire . I do n't know about the other people in this group ( or on the net ) but the idea of tanks being used to control civilians , in anything that pretends to be a free society is outrageous . When Big Government feels it is necessary to use that kind of force to stomp out protests ( even violent ) of the citizens , that suggests that the government is totally out of control , since that is effectively the government declaring war on its own people . If the government was living up to its responsibility , government of the people BY THE PEOPLE , not the 'lords ' and other elites who want to keep their good thing going , the citizens would n't feel the need to be resorting to acts that need to be squashed with a military boot . People do things like that because they have become convinced that it is the only option that remains , other attempts to have grievances redressed have been ignored . And yes , there is a criminal element that will exploit this , but the fact remains that the government has been unresponsive or such acts would n't be apt to happen . Still not an excuse to open up on civilians with tanks , heavy machine guns , or whatever . Its the old 'might makes right ' philosophy that is the hallmark of a government going rogue : They do n't like it ? Tough . We will simply squash them under an iron boot . Actually addressing their grievances in other than token fashion with huge volumes of hot air is just too inconvenient ... Sort of a variation on mushroom management : Keep them in the dark , Smother them with shit , and Crush them when ready ... And these are the folks that many liberals are trying to arrange things so that they will have a MONOPOLY on coercive force ( firearms that are than expensive toys ... ) by gutting the Bill of Rights ( cuz it just isn't PROGRESSIVE or does n't fit in with MODERN THINKING anymore ) ... Unbelievable . And I do believe amid the smoke , confusion , etc of a real riot situation , that it would be POSSIBLE for a tank to get away with firing the main gun into a building at close range ? One would hear an explosion among many explosions . It is loud , but it is not going to stand out like a 1000 pound bomb or a tactical nuke . There would be a hole blown in the wall , and some rubble , but with tanks knocking over walls , and other sources of buildings turning into rubble , and other covering racket such as gunfire , including 50 's tacking away , it would not stand out that much , and could be explained by `` musta been a gas leak ... `` . I think it could be done and not be reported under such conditions - it is POSSIBLE . It is not like a tank driving down a quiet street on a Sunday afternoon , turning and firing , you know . THAT would stand out , and be pretty impossible to cover up . > -- John L.

X * To stress C compilers with unusual code . X * To illustrate some of the subtleties of the C language . X * To provide a safe forum for poor C code . : - ) X X XRULES : X X To help us with the volume of entries , we ask that you follow these rules : X X 1 ) Your entry must be a complete program . X X 2 ) Your entry must be < = 3217 bytes in length . The number of characters X excluding whitespace ( tab , space , newline ) , and excluding any ; { or } X followed by either whitespace or end of file , must be < = 1536 . X X 3 ) Your entry must be submitted in the following format : X X -- -entry -- - Xrule : 1993 Xfix : y or n ( n = > this is a new entry , y = > this replaces an older entry ) Xtitle : title of entry ( see comments below ) Xentry : Entry number from 0 to 7 inclusive ( your 1st entry should by 0 ) Xdate : Date/time of submission in UTC ( see comments below ) Xhost : Machine ( s ) and OS ( s ) under which your entry was tested X Use tab indented lines if needed X -- -remark -- - X Place remarks about this entry in this section . It would be helpful if X you were to indent your remarks with 4 spaces , though it is not a X requirement . Also , if possible , try to avoid going beyond the 79th X column . Blank lines are permitted . X -- -author -- - Xname : your name Xorg : School/Company/Organization Xaddr : postal address X use tab indented lines to continue X do n't forget to include the country Xemail : Email address from a well known site or registered domain . X If you give several forms , list them on separate tab indented lines . Xanon : y or n ( y = > remain anonymous , n = > ok to publish this info ) X -- -info -- - XIf your program needs an info file , place a uuencoded copy of it in Xthis section . In the case of multiple info files , use multiple info Xsections . If your entry does not need a info file , skip this section . X -- -build -- - XPlace a uuencoded copy of the command ( s ) used to compile/build your program Xin this section . It must uudecode into a file named 'build ' . The resulting Xfile must be 255 bytes or less . X -- -program -- - XPlace a uuencoded copy of your program in this section . It must uudecode Xinto a file named is 'prog.c ' . The resulting file must follow rule # 2 . X -- -end -- - X X Regarding the above format : X X * The title must match the expression : [ a-zA-Z0-9_= ] [ a-zA-Z0-9_=+- ] * X and must be 1 to 12 characters in length . X X It is suggested , but not required , that the title should X incorporate your username ; in the case of multiple authors , X consider using parts of the usernames of the authors . X X * The date in the -- -entry -- - section should be given with respect X to UTC . The format of the date should be as returned by asctime ( ) X using the C locale . ( see guidelines for more info ) X X * You may correct/revise a previously submitted entry by sending X it to the contest email address . Be sure to set 'fix ' in the X -- -entry -- - section to ' n ' . The corrected entry must use the same X title and entry number as submittion that is being corrected . Be X sure that you note the resubmittion in the -- -remark -- - as well . X X * With the exception of the header , all text outside of the above X format may be ignored by the judges . If you need tell the judges X something , put it in the -- -remark -- - section , or send a separate X Email message to the judges . X X * Information from the -- -author -- - section will be published unless X ' y ' was given to the respective author 's 'anon ' line . X X * To credit multiple authors , include an -- -author -- - section for X each author . Each should start with -- -author -- - line , and X should be found between the -- -entry -- - and -- -build -- - sections . X X * The entry 's remarks should include : X - what this program does X - how to run the program ( sample args or input ) X - special compile or execution instructions , if any X - special filename requirements ( see rule 4 and 5 ) X - information about any -- -data -- - files X - why you think the program is obfuscated X - note if this entry is a re-submission of a previous entry . X - any other remarks ( humorous or otherwise ) X X * Do not rot13 your entry 's remarks . You may suggest that certain X portions of your remarks be rot13ed if your entry wins an award . X X * Info files should be used only to supplement your entry . They X should not be required to exist . X X If your entry does not need an info file , skip the -- -info -- - X section . If your entry needs multiple info files , use multiple X -- -info -- - sections , one per info file . You should describe X each info file in the -- -remark -- - section . X X 4 ) If your entry is selected as a winner , it will be modified as follows : X X 'build ' is incorporated into a makefile , and 'build ' is removed X 'prog.c ' is renamed to your entry 's title , followed by an optional X digit , followed by '.c' X your entry is compiled into a file with the name of your entry's X title , possibly followed by a digit X X If your entry requires that a build file exist , state so in your X entry 's remark section . The makefile will be arranged to execute a X build shell script containing the 'build ' information . The name of X this build shell script will be your entry 's title , possibly followed X by a digit , followed by '.sh ' . X X If needed , your entry 's remarks should indicate how your entry must X be changed in order to deal with the new filenames . X X 5 ) The build file , the source and the resulting executable should be X treated as read-only files . If your entry needs to modify these files , X it should make and modify a copy of the appropriate file . If this X occurs , state so in your entry 's remarks . X X 6 ) Entries that can not be compiled by an ANSI C compiler will be rejected . X Use of common C ( K & R + extensions ) is permitted , as long as it does not X cause compile errors for ANSI C compilers . X X 7 ) The program must be of original work . All programs must be in the X public domain . All copyrighted programs will be rejected . X X 8 ) Entries must be received prior to 07-May-93 0:00 UTC .

All other uses must receive prior permission in writing Xfrom both Landon Curt Noll and Larry Bassel . X XABOUT THIS FILE : X X This file is intended to help people who wish to submit entries to X the International Obfuscated C Code Contest ( IOCCC for short ) . X X This is not the IOCCC rules , though it does contain comments about X them . The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions . X Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are X allowed . Even so , you are safer if you remain within the guidelines . X X You should read the current IOCCC rules , prior to submitting entries . X The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines . X X XWHAT IS NEW IN 1993 : X X The entry format is better ( for us anyway ) . The program mkentry.c X has been updated . See ENTRY FORMAT . X X We will reject entries that can not be compiled using an ANSI C X compiler . Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers X fits are no longer permitted . Some of the new issues deal with X non-integral array types , variable number of arguments , C preprocessor X directives and the exit ( ) function . See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES . X X XHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS : X X You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests . See X FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners . X X Keep in mind that rules change from year to year , so some winning entries X may not be valid entries this year . What was unique and novel one year X might be 'old ' the next year . X X An entry is usually examined in a number of ways . We typically apply X a number of tests to an entry : X X * look at the original source X * convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCII X * C pre-process the source ignoring ' # include ' lines X * C pre-process the source ignoring ' # define ' and ' # include ' lines X * run it through a C beautifier X * examine the algorithm X * lint it X * compile it X * execute it X X You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests . X You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been X 'cleaned up ' by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier . X X Your entry need not do well under all , or in most tests . In certain X cases , a test is not important . Entries that compete for the X 'strangest/most creative source layout ' need not do as well as X others in terms of their algorithm . On the other hand , given X two such entries , we are more inclined to pick the entry that X does something interesting when you run it . X X We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules . As such , we leave X the contest open for creative rule interpretation . As in real life X programming , interpreting a requirements document or a customer request X is important . For this reason , we often award 'worst abuse of the X rules ' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way . X X If you do plan to abuse the rules , we suggest that you let us know X in the remarks section . Please note that an invitation to abuse X is not an invitation to break . We are strict when it comes to the X 3217 byte size limit . Also , abusing the entry format tends to X annoy more than amuse . X X We do realize that there are holes in the rules , and invite entries X to attempt to exploit them . We will award 'worst abuse of the rules' X and then plug the hole next year . Even so , we will attempt to use X the smallest plug needed , if not smaller . : - ) X X Check out your program and be sure that it works . We sometimes make X the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem , particularly X in or near the final round . On the other hand , we have seen some X of the best entries fall down because they did n't work . X X We tend to look down on a prime number printer , that claims that X 16 is a prime number . If you do have a bug , you are better off X documenting it . Noting `` this entry sometimes prints the 4th power X of a prime by mistake '' would save the above entry . And sometimes , X a strange bug/feature can even help the entry ! Of course , a correctly X working entry is best . X X XOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES : X X Doing masses of # defines to obscure the source has become 'old ' . We X tend to 'see thru ' masses of # defines due to our pre-processor tests X that we apply . Simply abusing # defines or -Dfoo=bar wo n't go as far X as a program that is more well rounded in confusion . X X Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code , and so do we : X X # define d define X # d foo < -- do n't expect this to turn into # define foo X X int i ; X j ; < -- do n't use such implicit type declaration X int k ; X X We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler . If you X must use non-ANSI C , such as K & R C , you must avoid areas that result in X compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers . X X Unfortunately , ANSI C requires array indexes to be of integral type . X Thus , the following classical obfuscation hacks are no longer allowed : X X int i ; X char *c ; X i [ c ] ; < -- - use c [ i ] instead X ( i+3 ) [ `` string '' ] ; < -- - use `` string '' [ i+3 ] instead X X If your entry uses functions that have a variable number of X arguments , be careful . Systems implement va_list as a wide variety X of ways . Because of this , a number of operations using va_list are X not portable and must not be used : X X * assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variable X * casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variable X * passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list arg X * passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list arg X * performing arithmetic on va_list variables X * using va_list as a structure or union X X In particular , do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char ** 's . X X Avoid using < varargs.h > , use < stdarg.h > instead . X X If you use C preprocessor directives ( # define , # if , # ifdef , ... ) , X the leading ' # ' must be the first character on a line . While some X C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading ' # ' , many do not . X X Because the exit ( ) function returns void on some systems , entries X must not assume that it returns an int . X X Small programs are best when they are short , obscure and concise . X While such programs are not as complex as other winners , they do X serve a useful purpose . They are often the only program that people X attempt to completely understand . For this reason , we look for X programs that are compact , and are instructional . X X One line programs should be short one line programs , say around 80 X bytes long . Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion . X X We tend to dislike programs that : X X * are very hardware specific X * are very OS or Un*x version specific X ( index/strchr differences are ok , but socket/streams specific X code is likely not to be ) X * dump core or have compiler warnings X ( it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark ' header item ) X * wo n't compile under both BSD or SYS V Un*x X * abusing the build file to get around the size limit X * obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphs X * are longer than they need to be X * are similar to previous winners X * are identical to previous losers : - ) X X Unless you are cramped for space , or unless you are entering the X 'best one liner ' category , we suggest that you format your program X in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines . X X The build file should not be used to try and get around the size X limit . It is one thing to make use of a several -D 's to help out , X but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -D 's in order to X try and squeeze the source under the size limit . You should feel X free to make use of the build file space , but you are better off X if you show some amount of restraint . X X We allowed whitespace , and in certain cases ; { or } do not impact X your program size ( up to a certain point ) , because we want to get X away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters . X X Given two versions of the same program , one that is a compact blob X of code , and the other that is formatted more like a typical C X program , we tend to favor the second version . Of course , a third X version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting X and/or obfuscated way , would definitely win over the first two ! X X We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating' X program . We are amazed at the many different sizes that claim X to be the smallest . There is nothing wrong with self-replicating X programs . In fact , a number of winners have been self-replicating . X You might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest ' , lest we ( or others ) X know of a smaller one ! X X X client entries should be as portable as possible . Entries that X adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored . Don't X depend on a particular type of display . For example , do n't depend X on color or a given size . Do n't require backing store . X X X client entries should avoid using X related libraries and X software that is not in wide spread use . We ask that such X client X entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and the X Athena widget set ( libX11.a , libXaw.a , libXmu.a and libXt.a ) . X Do n't use M*tif , Xv*ew , or OpenL*ok toolkits , since not everyone X has them . Avoid depending on a particular window manager . Not X everyone has X11r5 , and some people are stuck back in X11r4 ( or X earlier ) , so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5 . Better X yet , try to make your entry run on all version 11 X Window Systems . X X X client entries should not to depend on particular items on X .Xdefaults . If you must do so , be sure to note the required lines X in the -- -remark -- - section . X X We like programs that : X X * are as concise and small as they need to be X * do something at least quasi-interesting X * pass lint without complaint ( not a requirement , but it is nice ) X * are portable X * are unique or novel in their obfuscation style X * MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATION X * make us laugh and/or throw up : - ) X X Some types of programs ca n't excel in some areas . Of course , your X program does n't have to excel in all areas , but doing well in several X areas really does help . X X We freely admit that interesting , creative or humorous comments in X the -- -remark -- - section helps your chance of winning . If you had to X read of many twisted entries , you too would enjoy a good laugh or two . X We think the readers of the contest winners do as well . X X Be creative ! X X XENTRY FORMAT : X X In order to help us process the many entries , we must request your X assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way . This format , X in addition , allows us to quickly separate information about the X author from the program itself . ( see JUDGING PROCESS ) X X We have provided the program , mkentry , as an example of how to X format entries . You should be aware of the following warning that X is found in mkentry.c : X X This program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules . Every X attempt has been made to make sure that this program produces X an entry that conforms to the contest rules . In all cases , X where this program differs from the contest rules , the X contest rules will be used . Be sure to check with the X contest rules before submitting an entry . X X You are not required to use mkentry . It is convenient , however , X as it attempts to uuencode the needed files , and attempt to check X the entry against the size rules . X X If you have any suggestions , comments , fixes or complaints about X the mkentry.c program , please send Email to the judges . ( see below ) X X The following is a sample entry : X X -- -entry -- - Xrule : 1993 Xfix : n Xtitle : chonglab Xentry : 0 Xdate : Mon Mar 1 08:45:20 1993 Xhost : Un*x v6 , pdp11/45 X 2.9BSD , pdp11/70 X -- -remark -- - X This is a non-obfuscated obfuscated C program .

If an entry wins , we will rename X its source and binary to avoid filename collision . By tradition , X we use the name of the entry 's title , followed by an optional X digit in case of name conflicts . X X If the above entry somehow won the 'least likely to win ' award , X we would use chonglab.c and chonglab . X X If your entry depends on , or requires that your build , source X and/or binary files be a particular name , please say so in the X -- -remark -- - section . If this case applies , it would be be helpful X if you did one of the following : X X * Tell us how to change the filename ( s ) in your entry . X X * Have the build file make copies of the files . For example : X X cc prog.c -o special_name need special binary X X or rm -f special_src.c need special source X cp prog.c special_src.c X cc special_src.c -o special_name X X or rm -f special_build need special build X tail +4 build > special_build X sh < special_build X X * Assume that we will use the entry title . Send us a version of X your build/program files that uses the name convention . You X should uuencode these files in -- -data -- - sections . X X If your entry needs to modify its source , info or binary files , X please say so in the -- -remark -- - section . You should try to avoid X touching your original build , source and binary files . You should X arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify . This X will allow people to re-generate your entry from scratch . X X Remember that your entry may be built without a build file . We X typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile . If the X build file must exist , say so in the -- -remark -- - section . X X If your entry needs special info files , you should uuencode them X into -- -info -- - sections . In the case of multiple info files , X use multiple -- -info -- - sections . If no info files are needed , X then skip the -- -info -- - section . X X Info files are intended to be input , or detailed information that X does not fit well into the -- -remark -- - section . For example , an X entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample X programs for the user to compile . An entry might want to include a X lengthy design document , that might not be appropriate for a X 'hints ' file . X X Info files should be used only to supplement your entry . For X example , info files may provide sample input or detailed X information about your entry . Because they are supplemental , X the entry should not require them exist . X X In some cases , your info files might be renamed to avoid name X conflicts . If info files should not be renamed for some reason , X say so in the -- -remark -- - section . X X Info files must uudecode into the current directory . If they X absolutely must be renamed , or moved into a sub-directory , say X so in the -- -remark -- - section . X X When submitting multiple entries , be sure that each entry has X a unique entry number from 0 to 7 . Your first entry should X have entry number 0 . X X With the exception of the header , all text outside of the entry X format may be ignored . That is , do n't place text outside of the X entry and expect the judges to see it . ( Our decoding tools aren't X AI progs ! ) If you need tell the the something , put it in the X -- -remark -- - section , or send a Email to the judges at : X X ... ! { apple , pyramid , sun , uunet } ! hoptoad ! judges ( not the address for X judges @ toad.com submitting entries ) X X The date should be given with respect to UTC . ( Some systems refer X to this as GMT or GMT0 ) The format of the date should be that as X returned by asctime ( ) in the C locale . An example of such a string is : X X Thr Apr 01 00:47:00 1993 X X This format is similar to the output of the date ( 1 ) command . The X string does not include the timezone name before the year . On many X systems , one of the following command will produce a similar string : X X date -u `` + % a % h % d % T 19 % y '' X date -u | sed -e 's/ ... \ ( 19 [ 0-9 ] [ 0-9 ] \ ) $ /\1/' X sh -c 'TZ=UTC date | sed -e `` s/ ... \ ( 19 [ 0-9 ] [ 0-9 ] \ ) $ /\1/ '' ' X sh -c 'TZ=GMT date | sed -e `` s/ ... \ ( 19 [ 0-9 ] [ 0-9 ] \ ) $ /\1/ '' ' X sh -c 'TZ=GMT0 date | sed -e `` s/ ... \ ( 19 [ 0-9 ] [ 0-9 ] \ ) $ /\1/ '' ' X X You are allowed to update/fix/revise your entry . To do so , set X the 'fix ' line in the -- -entry -- - section to ' y ' instead of ' n ' . X Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number X as well , as these are used to determine which entry is to be X replaced . X X XJUDGING PROCESS : X X Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll . X X Entries are unpacked into individual directories . The Email message X is unpacked into individual files , each containing : X X -- -entry -- - section X all -- -author -- - sections X all -- -info -- - sections X -- -build -- - section X -- -program -- - section X any other text , including the Email message headers X X Prior to judging , the 'any other text ' file is scanned to be sure X it does not contain useful information ( or in case the entry was X malformed and did not unpack correctly ) . Information from the X -- -author -- - sections are not read until the judging process is X complete , and then only from entries that have won an award . X X The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular X individual . We are usually kept in the dark as much as you are X until the final awards are given . We like the surprise of finding X out in the end , who won and where they were from . X X We attempt to keep all entries anonymous , unless they win an award . X Because the main 'prize ' of winning is being announced , we make all X attempts to send non-winners into oblivion . We remove all non-winning X files , and shred all related paper . By tradition , we do not even X reveal the number of entries that we received . ( for the curious , X we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCC X winners at talks ) X X After the Usenix announcement , we attempt to send Email to the X authors of the winning entries . One reason we do this is to give X the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their X entry . They are given the chance to correct mistakes , typos . We X often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well . X This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world . X X Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds . During a round , X the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles ; X the pile that advances on to the next round , and the pile that does X not . We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in the X previous round . Thus , an entry gets at least two readings . X X A reading consists of a number of actions : X X * reading the -- -entry -- - section X * reading the uudecoded -- -build -- - section X * reading the uudecoded -- -program -- - section X * reading the uudecoded -- -info -- - section ( s ) , if any X * passing the source thru the C pre-processor X shipping over any # include files X * performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the source X * passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processor X shipping over any # include files X X In later rounds , other actions are performed : X X * linting the source X * compiling/building the source X * running the program X * performing misc tests on the source and binary X X Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries , entries X are judged on an individual basis . An entry is set aside because it X does not , in our opinion , meet the standard established by the round . X When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries , we begin to form X award categories . Entries begin to compete with each other for awards . X An entry often will compete in several categories . X X The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries X we receive . A typical category list might be : X X * best small one line program X * best small program X * strangest/most creative source layout X * most useful obfuscated program X * best game that is obfuscated X * most creatively obfuscated program X * most deceptive C code X * best X client ( see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES ) X * best abuse of ANSI C X * worst abuse of the rules X * < anything else so strange that it deserves an award > X X We do not limit ourselves to this list . For example , a few entries are so X good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round . X We will invent awards categories for them , if necessary . X X In the final round process , we perform the difficult tasks of X reducing the remaining entries ( typically about 25 ) down to 8 or 10 X winners . Often we are confident that the entries that make it into X the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not X make it . The selection of the winners out of the final round , is X less clear cut . X X Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win , but is beat out X by a similar , but slightly better entry . For this reason , it is X sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry X that failed to win in a previous year . This assumes , of course , X that the entry is worth improving in the first place ! X X More often that not , we select a small entry ( usually one line ) , a X strange/creative layout entry , and an entry that abuses the contest X rules in some way . X X In the end , we traditionally pick one entry as 'best ' . Sometimes such X an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry . More often , the X 'best ' is picked because it does well in a number of categories . X X XANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS : X X The first announcement , occurs at a Summer Usenix conference . By tradition , X this is done during the latter part of the UUNET/IOCCC BOF , just prior to X the Berkeley BSD , and BSDI BOF . X X Winning entries will be posted in late June to the following groups : X X comp.lang.c comp.unix.wizards alt.sources X X In addition , pointers to these postings are posted to the following X X comp.sources.d alt.sources.d misc.misc X comp.sources.misc comp.windows.x X X Winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives . See X below for details . X X Often , winning entries are published in selected magazines . Winners X have appeared in books ( `` The New Hackers Dictionary '' ) and on T-Shirts . X X Last , but not least , winners receive international fame and flames ! : - ) X X XFOR MORE INFORMATION : X X You may contact the judges by sending Email to the following address : X X ... ! { apple , pyramid , sun , uunet } ! hoptoad ! judges ( not the address for X judges @ toad.com submitting entries ) X X Questions and comments about the contest are welcome .

From : irfan @ davinci.ece.wisc.edu ( Irfan Alan ) Subject : A TREATISE ON THE MIRACLES OF MUHAMMAD SAW , PART-2 Organization : Univ . of Wisconsin-Madison ; Electrical & Computer Engineering Distribution : usa Lines : 125 The following is an introduction as to who is Muhammad SAW as will be covered with this treatise . MUHAMMAD peace and blessings of Allah be upon him ( SAW ) is the last prophet of Islam . He is the Prophet who is revealed the last Holy Scripture , Qur'an , by Allah SWA ( all praise be to Him ) through the Arch Angel Gabriel . He is the seal of all prophets till the day of judgement as stated in the Qur'an by Allah SWA ( all praise be to Him ) . Muhammad SAW lived between 571-632 AC . All other prophethoods claimed after Muhammad SAW , is a treason against Islam , against Qur'an , against the message of Allah SWA . Muhammad SAW is from the seed of Ishmael , another messenger of Allah and son of Abraham also a messenger of Allah . He is the Messenger that previous holy scriptures foretold his coming . The above mentioned verse from the Qur'an is from Chapter 33 , Verse 40 whose rough translation is as follows : Muhammad is not the father of any of your men , but ( he is ) the messenger of Allah , and the seal of the prophets , and Allah has full knowledge of all things . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Commentary on the above verse : When a document is sealed , it is complete , and there can be no further addition . The Holy Prophet Muhammad SAW closed the long line of Messengers . Allah 's teaching is and will always be continuous , but there has been and will be NO Prophet after Muhammad SAW . The later ages will want thinkers , and revivers , not Prophets . This is not an arbitrary matter . It is a decree full of knowledge and wisdom , '' for Allah has full knowledge of all things . '' -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- DROPLET VOL 1 , No 11 , Part 2 A D R O P L E T From The Vast Ocean Of The Miraculous Qur'an Translations from the Arabic and Turkish Writings of Bediuzzaman Said Nursi , The Risale-i Noor VOL 1 , No 11 , Part 2 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- NINETEENTH LETTER MU'JIZAT-I AHMEDIYE RISALESI ( A TREATISE ON THE MIRACLES OF MUHAMMED SAW ) ( continued from Droplet Vol 1 , No 11 , Part 1 ) SECOND SIGN : The Noble Messenger ( SAW ) declared His prophethood , and presented to humanity a decree as the Glorious Qur'an and manifest miracles which number , according to the scholars , one thousand . The occurrence of those miracles in their entirety is as certain as the fact that He declared himself prophet . In fact , as a shown by the words of the most obstinate unbelievers quoted in various places of the Wise Our'an , even they could not deny the occurrence of His miracles , but only called them -hasha wa kella ! - ( Allah forbids ) sorcery , in order to satisfy themselves , or to deceive their followers . The miracles of Muhammad ( SAW ) have the certainty of confirmation by consensus of Ulema ( scholars of Islam ) to the hundreth degree . The Miracle is the conformation by the CREATOR of the universe of His declaration of Prophethood ; it has the effect of the words , 'You have indeed spoken the truth ! ' Suppose that you said in the assembly of a ruler , while being observed by Him , 'The true ruler has appointed me to such and such position . 'At a time when you were asked to prove your claim , the word 'Yes' uttered by the ruler would sufficiently support you . Or , if the ruler changed his usual practice and attitude at your request , this would confirm your claim even more soundly and more definitely than would the word 'Yes . ' In the same way , ALLAH 's Most Noble Messenger claimed : ' I am the envoy of the CREATOR of this universe . My proof is that He will change His unbroken order at my request and my prayer . Now look at my fingers : He makes them run like a fountain with five spigots . Look at the moon : by a gesture of my finger , He splits it in two . Look at that tree : to affirm me , and to bear witness to me , it moves and comes near to me . Look at this food : although it is barely enough for two or three men , it satisfies two or three hundred . 'Further he shows hundreds of similar miracles . However , the evidences of the veracity of this high being and the proofs of his prophethood are not restricted to his miracles . All his deeds and acts , his words and behavior , his moral conduct and manners , his character and appearance prove to the attentive his truthfulness and seriousness . Indeed , many people such as Abdullah b. Salam , the famous scholar of the Children of Israel , came to belief merely by seeing him , and said , 'No lie can hide in this face , nor can any fraud be found in it ! ' Although many of the researchers have concluded that the proofs of the prophethood of Muhammad and his miracles number about one thousand , there are thousands , perhaps hundreds of thousands of proofs of his prophethood . And hundreds of thousands of truth-seeking men ( muhakkikiin ) with varying opinions have affirmed his prophethood in an equal number of ways . The Wise Our'an alone demonstrates thousands of the proofs of his prophethood , in addition to its own forty aspects of miraculousness . Since prophethood is as a phenomenon of humanity , and hundreds of thousands of individuals who claimed prophethood and performed miracles have lived and passed away ; then , the prophethood of Muhammad ( SAW ) is of a certanity superior to that of the prophethood of all the others . For whatever evidences , qualities and attributes became the means of the prophethood and messengership of all the messengers such as Jesus ( AS ) and Moses ( AS ) , they are all owned in a more perfect and comprehensive fashion by Muhammad ( SAW ) . And since the causes and means of prophetic authority exist more perfectly in the person of Muhammad ( SAW ) , this authority is to be found in him with more certanity than all the other prophets . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - To be Continued Allah Willing .

As you have presented it , it is indeed an argument from incredulity . However , from what I have seen , it is not often presented in this manner . It is usually presented more in the form , `` And *besides* , I can not see ... ... nor have I ever been offered a convincing explanation .

This would be a positive life saver for African or other drought affected countries .

The only controllers I know of are the ones out of the National Semiconductor DRAM Management Handbook ( 1988 edition ) eg . DP8429 . I would like to know if another manufacturer produces one which may be easier to implement in my circuit . BTW , if anyone is wanting to hook up DRAM to a microcontroller , Dallas Semiconductor makes a neat chip : the DS1262 Serial DRAM Nonvolatizer Chip . It uses the SPI ( I2C ) bus and refreshes/controls up to 16Mx1 of DRAM memory . It can use an external battery to refresh the DRAM when the power is off . Price is $ 11.75 from Dallas ( quan 1 ) .

If they are n't Atheists , > what are they ? When the Quran uses the word *din* it means way of individual thinking , behaving , communal order and protocols based on a set of beliefs . This is often interpreted as the much weaker term religion . The atheists are not mentioned in the Quran along with Jews , Mushriqin , Christians , etc . because the latter are all din . To have a din you need a set of beliefs , assumptions , etc , to forma a social code . For example the Marxist have those , such as History , Conflict , etc . That they do not put idols ( sometimes they did ) to represent those assuptions does not mean they are any different from the other Mushriq , or roughly polytheists . There can not be social Atheism , because when there is a community , that community needs common ideas or standard beliefs to coordinate the society . When they inscribe assumptions , say Nation , or `` Progress is the natural consequence of Human activity '' or `` parlamentarian democracy is doubtlessly the best way of government '' , however they individually insist they do not have gods , from the Quranic point of view they do . Therefore by definition , atheism does not exist . `` We are a atheist society '' in fact means `` we reject the din other than ours '' . Atheism can only exist when people reject all the idols/gods/dogmas/ suppositions/.. of the society that they part , and in that case that is a personal deviation of belief , and Quran tells about such deviations and disbelief . But as I mentioned , from a Quranic point of looking at things , there is no Atheism in the macro level . I think it took more than one minute . Kutluk

( in the 'big ' cities like Stockholm & Gothenburg all trafic was forbidden , exept busses and taxis , during the whole weekend . ) The day was a Sunday and everything was prepared in before . Before the day we was told to follow the yellow lines on the road and after it was the white one that matters . The signs with arrows on was prepared with a 'left mode ' label that was torn off that night to reveal the new right mode arrow . The year after Iceland also changed . About cars : Before the H-day ( H as in `` Hoegertrafik '' . `` hoeger '' is Swedish and stands for 'right ' ) practically all cars already had their steering wheels on the left side . Even the imported cars from UK had the wheel on 'the right side ' . At last we have cars with the wheels on the right side . : - ) More contries that uses the left side is : Japan Tanzania ( I think ) New Zeeland How about South Africa ? BTW .

I realize the off-hand nature of the numbers I used . And I ca n't answer as to what an acceptable loss rate is . However , as I said in another post , I despise the idea of supporting criminals for life . It 's the economics of the situation that concern me most . The money spent feeding , clothing , housing and taking care of people who have demonstrated that they are unfit to live in society could go to a number of places , all of which I , and probably others , would consider far more worthwhile and which would enrish the lives of all Americans .

You could prove almost anything by taking little quotes out of context from the Bible - it 's a big book , you know . I doubt you could find a single case of a anti-ecological action taking place specifically because teh perpetrator was motivated by a Christian belief . As for the Nazis , they were motivated by German Nationalism , not by Christianity . In fact they despised Christianity as a weak pacifist religion , and were much more keen on pagan glorification of strength and warfare . They killed the Jews because they were not Germans , not because they were '' Christ-killers '' - they were just as keen on killing the other non-German ethnic minority , the Romanies or Gypsies .

Ultra-violet ( by definition ? ) goes from the blue end of the spectrum that people see to the radio spectrum ( X-rays , cosmic rays etc ) . possibly you could get light at the fringe of visibility ( which people with false eye-lenses can see easily , since it 's your lenses that soak up most of the UV ) , however since most people use UV to get other things to ` glow ' , and the near-blue is less energetic , it would probably not work as well , if it worked at all .

I expect what is going on here is that your colormap is full and , when the new application starts up , it can not add the colors that it needs to the colormap . It therefore has to pick and choose from the existing colors . This makes it look ugly until it 's window gets priority . Then Macx changes the colormap so that the selected app is getting the exact colors it wanted , but now other applications are having to make do with it 's colormap . This is a problem with all color X servers ( or at least all color Xservers I have seen ) when the demands of the applications exceed the size of the colormap . My solution is usually to ( 1 ) avoid colormap-greedy apps and ( 2 ) display applications where color is just icing on the cake in monochrome mode rather than in color ( if this is an option for the application ) . - Doug Shaker voice : 415/572-0200 fax : 415/572-1300 email : dshaker @ qualix.com mail : Qualix Group 1900 S.

What is the mechanism and why would a physician > call for chest xrays to diagnose the cause of the clubbing ? Purists often distinguish between `` true '' clubbing and `` pseudo '' clubbing , the difference being that with `` true '' clubbing the angle of the nail when viewed from the side is constantly negative when proceeding distally ( towards the fingertip ) . With `` pseudo '' clubbing , the angle is initially positive , then negative , which is the normal situation . `` Real '' internists can talk for hours about clubbing . I 'm limited to a couple of minutes . Whether this distinction has anything to do with reality is entirely unclear , but it is one of those things that internists love to paw over during rounds . Supposedly , only `` true '' clubbing is associated with disease . The problem is that the list of diseases associated with clubbing is quite long , and includes both congenital conditions and acquired disease . Since many of these diseases are associated with cardiopulmonary problems leading to right to left shunts and chronic hypoxemia , it is very reasonable to get a chest xray . However , many of the congenital abnormalities would only be diagnosed with a cardiac catheterization . The cause of clubbing is unclear , but presumably relates to some factor causing blood vessels in the distal fingertip to dilate abnormally . Clubbing is one of those things from an examination which is a tipoff to do more extensive examination . Often , however , the cause of the clubbing is quite apparent . -km

However , if one agent wishes to break the crypto without the cooperation of the other agent , a 40-bit key is not going to stand in the way of a brute force attack .

We won the war , > hurrah hurrah ! The number of civilian Iraqi deaths were way over-exaggerated and exploited for anti-war emotionalism by the liberal news media . The facts are that less Iraqis died in the Gulf War than did civilians in any other war of comparable size this century ! This was due mostly to the short duration coupled with precise surgical bombing techniques which were technically possible only recently . The idea that `` hundreds of thousands '' of Iraqi citizens died is ludicrous . Not even `` hundreds of thousands '' of Iraqi soldiers died , and they were the ones being targeted ! Or do you think that the US and its allies were specifically out to kill and maim Iraqi civilians ? Either the smart bombs did n't hit their targets ( and we know they did ) , or they were targeting civilian targets ( ! ) which is hardly condusive to destroying Iraq 's military potential . The military mission planners are not fools , they know they have to hit *military* targets to win a war . Hitting civilian targets does nothing but unite the people against you , not a laudable goal if one wants the people to rise up against their tyrant-dictator . > > OK , so some innocent people died .

How about all the innocent people who died in blanket-bombing in WW2 ? I do n't hear you bemoaning them ! War is never an exact science , but with smart bombs , it 's becoming more exact with a smaller percentage of civilian casualties . Sometimes mistakes are made ; targets are misidentified ; innocents die . That 's war the way it really is . But the alternative , to allow tyrannical dictators to treat the earth like it 's one big rummage sale , grabbing everything they can get is worse .

You come off sounding like a complete peace-nik idiot , although I feel sure that was not your intent . So the Iraqi war was wrong , eh ? I 'm sure that appeasement would have worked better than war , just like it did in WW2 , eh ? I guess we should n't have fought WW2 either -- just think of all those innocent German civilians killed in Dresden and Hamburg . How about all the poor French who died in the crossfire because we invaded the continent ? We should have just let Hitler take over Europe , and you 'd be speaking German instead of English right now . Tyrants like Hussein *have* to be stopped . His kind do n't understand diplomacy ; they only understand the point of a gun . My only regret is that Bush wimped out and did n't have the military roll into Baghdad , so now Hussein is still in power and the Iraqi people 's sacrifice ( not to mention the 357 Americans who died ) was for naught . Liberating Kuwait was a good thing , but wiping Hussein off the map would 've been better ! And as for poor , poor Rodney King ! Did you ever stop and think *why* the jury in the first trial brought back a verdict of `` not guilty '' ? Those who have been foaming at the mouth for the blood of those policemen certainly have looked no further than the video tape . But the jury looked at *all* the evidence , evidence which you and I have not seen . When one makes a judgment without the benefit of a trial where evidence can be presented on both sides , one has simply lowered himself to the level of vigilante justice , a state-of-mind which your sarcasm above seemingly spoke against , but instead tends to support in the case against the policemen . Law in this country is intended to protect the rights of the accused , whether they be criminals or cops . One is not found guilty if there is a reasonable doubt of one 's guilt , and only the jury is in a position to assess the evidence and render a verdict . Anyone else is simply succumbing to verbal vigilantism . Regards , Jim B .

With digital encryption and authentication technologies , the possibility of a widespread digital cash system may someday be realized . A system utilizing codes sent between users and banks ( similar to today 's checking system except entirely digital ) may be one approach . The issues of cryptography , privacy , and anonymity are closely associated with transfer of cash in an economy . See the article in Scientific American by David Chaum ( ~Dec.1992 ) . An experimental digital bank is run by Karl Barrus < elee9sf @ Menudo.UH.EDU > based on suggestions by Hal Finney on the cypherpunks mailing list . To use the server send mail to elee7h5 @ rosebud.ee.uh.edu message with the following text : : : command : help user @ host where ` user @ host ' is your email address . _____ < 5.2 > What is a `` hacker '' or `` cracker '' ? These terms arouse strong feelings by many on their meaning , especially on the internet . In the general news media in the past a person who uses computers and networks to malicious ends ( such as breaking into systems ) has been referred to as a hacker , but most internet users prefer the term `` cracker '' for this . Instead , a `` hacker '' is perceived as a benign but intensely ambitious , curious , and driven computer user who explores obscure areas of a system , for example -- -something of a proud electronic pioneer and patriot . This is the sense intended in this document . See also the `` Hacker 's Dictionary '' and the FAQ ` alt-security-faq ' . _____ < 5.3 > What is a `` cypherpunk '' ? From the charter of the cypherpunk mailing list : > Cypherpunks assume privacy is a good thing and wish there were > more of it . Cypherpunks acknowledge that those who want privacy > must create it for themselves and not expect governments , > corporations , or other large , faceless organizations to grant > them privacy out of beneficence . Cypherpunks know that people > have been creating their own privacy for centuries with whispers , > envelopes , closed doors , and couriers . Cypherpunks do not seek > to prevent other people from speaking about their experiences or > their opinions . See information on the cypherpunk mailing list below . See also the CryptoAnarchist Manifesto and the Cryptography Glossary in soda.berkeley.edu : /pub/cypherpunks . _____ < 5.4 > What is ` steganography ' and anonymous pools ? Closely associated with encryption is ` steganography ' or the techniques for not only pursuing private ( encrypted ) communication but concealing the very existence of the communication itself . Many new possibilities in this area are introduced with the proliferation of computer technology . For example , it is possible to encode messages in the least-significant bits of images , typically the most 'noisy ' . In addition , when such an item is posted in a public place ( such as a newsgroup ) , virtually untraceable communication can take place between sender and receiver . For steganographic communications in the electronic realm one another possibility is setting up a mailing list where individual messages get broadcast to the entire list and individual users decode particular messages with their unique key . An anonymous pool has been set up by Miron Cuperman ( miron @ extropia.wimsey.com ) for experiments . Send email to < pool0-request @ extropia.wimsey.com > with one of the following commands in the subject line : subscribe unsubscribe help _____ < 5.5 > What is ` security through obscurity ' ? ` Security through obscurity ' refers to the attempt to gain protection from system weaknesses by hiding sensitive information or programs relating to them . For example , a company may not make public information on its software 's encryption techniques to evade ` attacks ' based on knowledge of it . Another example would be concealing data on the existence of security holes or bugs in operating systems . Or , some reliance may be made on the fact that some standard or mechanism with potential problems is serious because they are `` not widely known '' or `` not widely used . '' This argument is occasionally applied to mechanisms for email and Usenet posting ` forgery ' . ` Security through obscurity ' is regarded as a very feeble technique at best and inappropriate and ineffective at worst ( also called the `` head-in-the-sand approach '' ) . See the FAQ for alt.security . Some remarks of John Perry Barlow , cofounder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation , directed to NSA agents at the First International Symposium on National Security & National Competitiveness held in McLean , Virginia Dec. 1 , 1992 : > Digitized information is very hard to stamp classified or keep > contained . ... This stuff is incredibly leaky and volatile . It's > almost a life form in its ability to self-propagate . If > something hits the Net and it 's something which people on there > find interesting it will spread like a virus of the mind . I > believe you must simply accept the idea that we are moving into > an environment where any information which is at all interesting > to people is going to get out . And there will be very little > that you can do about it . This is not a bad thing in my view , > but you may differ ... _____ < 5.6 > What are ` identity daemons ' ? RFC-931 describes a protocol standard that allows UNIX programs to query a remote user 's login name after connection to a local communication socket ( a connection of this type is established during FTP and TELNET sessions , for example ) . The standard is not widely supported , perhaps 10 % of internet sites currently implement it but the number is increasing . The mechanism is detrimental to anonymity . Regular users can not disable it but system adminstrators can circumvent it . This standard may represent a trend toward greater authentication mechanisms . _____ < 5.7 > What new standards are needed to guard electronic privacy ? Remailing/Posting -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - - Stable , secure , protected , officially sanctioned and permitted , publicly and privately operated anonymous servers and hubs . - Official standards for encryption and anonymity in mail and USENET postings . - Truly anonymous protocols with source and destination information obscured or absent and hidden routing mechanisms ( chaining , encrypted addresses , etc . ) - Standards for anonymous email addressing , embedding files , and remailer site chaining . General -- -- -- - - Recognition of anonymity , cryptography , and related privacy shields as legitimate , useful , desirable , and crucial by the general public and their governments . - Widespread use and implementation of these technologies by systems designers into hardware , software , and standards , implemented ` securely , ' ` seamlessly , ' and ` transparently ' . - General shift of use , dependence , and reliance to means other than wiretapping and electronic surveillance by law enforcement agencies . - Publicity , retraction , and dissolution of laws and government agencies opposed to privacy , replaced by structures dedicated to strengthening and protecting it .

The foundation publishes EFF News ( EFFector Online ) electronically , send requests to effnews-request @ eff.org . In a letter to Mitchell Kapor from the Chairman of the Subcommittee with primary jurisdiction over telecommunications policy dated November 5 , 1991 , Representative Edward J.

The Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility have been working to protect and promote electronic civil liberties issues since ~1982 . The group has three offices ( Palo Alto , Cambridge , Washington , DC ) and 20 chapters . It is involved in litigation against the FBI , The NSA , NIST , the Secret Service and other other U.S. government agencies to declassify and provide documentation on issues such as Operation Sundevil , the FBI wiretap proposal , NSA 's interference in crypography , the breakup of the 2600 raid in Arlington , Va in Nov 1992 . Members speak frequently in front on Congress , state legislators and public utility commissions to testify on privacy , information policy , computer security , and caller identification . CPSR has created an extensive Internet Privacy library available via FTP , Gopher , WAIS , and email at cpsr.org , currently comprising the largest collection of privacy documents on the internet . For more information , anonymous FTP cpsr.org : /cpsr/ . ( Thanks to Dave Banisar < banisar @ washofc.cpsr.org > for contributions here . ) _____ < 6.3 > What was ` Operation Sundevil ' and the Steve Jackson Game case ? In the early 1990 's a fear spread among U.S. law enforcement agencies on the illicit activities of ` hackers ' and ` phreakers ' involved in such activities as credit card fraud and long-distance call thievery . ( see ftp.eff.org : /pub/SJG/General_Information/EFFector1.04 ) : > ` Operation Sundevil , ' the Phoenix-inspired crackdown of May > 8,1990 , concentrated on telephone code-fraud and credit-card > abuse , and followed this seizure plan with some success . > [ Bulletin Board Systems ] went down all over America , terrifying > the underground and swiftly depriving them of at least some of > their criminal instruments . It also saddled analysts with some > 24,000 floppy disks , and confronted harried Justice Department > prosecutors with the daunting challenge of a gigantic nationwide > hacker show-trial involving highly technical issues in dozens of > jurisdictions . Massive ` show-trials ' never materialized , although isolated instances of prosecution were pursued . The movement reached a crescendo in Texas with the highly publicized case of illegal search and seizure involving the Steve Jackson Games company of Austin Texas on March 1 , 1990 . From the column GURPS ' LABOUR LOST by Bruce Sterling < bruces @ well.sf.ca.us > in Fantasy and Science Fiction Magazine : > In an early morning raid with an unlawful and unconstitutional > warrant , agents of the Secret Service conducted a search of the > SJG office . When they left they took a manuscript being prepared > for publication , private electronic mail , and several computers , > including the hardware and software of the SJG Computer Bulletin > Board System . Yet Jackson and his business were not only > innocent of any crime , but never suspects in the first place . > The raid had been staged on the unfounded suspicion that > somewhere in Jackson 's office there ` might be ' a document > compromising the security of the 911 telephone system . FBI agents involved in the seizure were named in a civil suit filed on behalf of Steve Jackson Games by The Electronic Frontier Foundation . See information on EFF below . From an article by Joe Abernathy in the Houston Chronicle ~Feb 1 , 1993 : > AUSTIN -- An electronic civil rights case against the Secret > Service closed Thursday with a clear statement by federal > District Judge Sam Sparks that the Service failed to conduct a > proper investigation in a notorious computer crime crackdown , > and went too far in retaining custody of seized equipment . > > Secret Service Special Agent Timothy Foley of Chicago , who was in > charge of three Austin computer search-and-seizures on March 1 , > 1990 , that led to the lawsuit , stoically endured Spark 's rebuke > over the Service 's poor investigation and abusive computer > seizure policies .

I suppose that depends on how you define 'vast ' majority ... . You are correct about 'majority . ' Somewhere between 1 out of three and one out of 10 will at some period in their lives experience a violent assault . The risk is generally higher than emergency medical problems like heart attack and stroke . 'Vast ' is probably too loose a term . With approximately 1,000,000 Americans using firearms each year , over a 30 year period we get ( roughly , since some may have to do this more than once ) 30 MILLION Americans with experience in using firearms for self defense . 30/250 yields 12 percent of the population . ( Yes , I know that is a REAL rough estimate . We 're closer to 270 million now , but many of these are minors and should be included etc , thus the percentage if anything is low . ) At any rate , most minority groups in this range are not usually referred to as 'tiny ' minorities , so I do n't see how the other part of the group can be referred to as the 'vast ' majority . A little more work might support a 'simple ' majority of Americans never use , own or display a firearm . Certainly when you are talking about OWNERSHIP you are wrong . Nearly half of your fellow citizens own one or more firearms . > Besides , there are other > means of self-protection which can be just as effective > as firearms . Please provide a list of other means that are as effective . Then you might convince your local police departments to switch . Good luck . Rick .

On April 19 , cruise science Memory Readouts ( MROs ) were performed for the Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer ( EUV ) , Dust Detector ( DDS ) , and Magnetometer ( MAG ) instruments . Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly . 2 . On April 19 , a Command Detector Unit Signal-to-Noise Ratio ( CDUSNR ) test and a Radio Frequency Subsystem Automatic Gain Control ( RFSAGC ) test were performed using the LGA-1 ( Low Gain Antenna # 1 ) over DSS-63 ( Madrid 70 meter antenna ) and DSS-61 ( Madrid 34 meter antenna ) , respectively . Data analysis is in process . These tests are periodically performed to provide detailed information relative to the telecom command hardware integrity . 3 . On April 19 , a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to 264 hours , its planned value during this mission phase . 4 . On April 21 , the first of two suppressed carrier/DSN ( Deep Space Network ) advanced receiver characterization tests was performed over DSS-14 ( Goldstone 70 meter antenna ) . The spacecraft modulation index was varied from 43 degrees to 90 degrees for a range of ground receiver bandwidth settings . 5 . The AC bus imbalance measurement has not exhibited significant change ( greater than 25 DN ) throughout this period but the DC bus imbalance measurement has . The AC measurement reads 20 DN ( 4.5 volts ) . The DC measurement has ranged from 43 DN ( 4.6 volts ) to 138 DN ( 16.2 volts ) and currently reads 138 DN ( 16.2 volts ) . These measurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special anomaly team . 6 .

The first and easiest to fix is interference from something around the monitor , such as another monitor or other electrical device . Try moving the system to another location to fix that problem . Second , because of the scan rate of the monitor , it tends to synchronize with room lights and can cause the interference you are seeing . Try turning off all lights in the room ( s ) around the system and see if that helps . If not , try moving the system somewhere else . A third solution would be to get a 14 '' Apple Color Display - It should not have the same problem the 12 '' Color is more suceptible to . You can try calling Apple 's new support number ( in the U.S. ) at 1-800-SOS-APPLE .

I played Elvira I & II , and think that Horrorsoft has finally made a very playable game with Waxworks . The look and feel is roughly the same as in the Elvira games , though the real time fighting is a little easier to survive . The first two games , especially Elvira II : Jaws of Cerberus made it very tough to stay alive and hit-point restoring was very difficult . This is not to say that Waxworks is a walk in the park , but it is quite fair , in that there is always some weapon to be found that is quite effective , or hint given as to the proper fighting strategy . In one of the four wax works to be explored , there is no fighting at all ( well almost none ) , though all four contain moderately challanging puzzles . The really interesting thing about this game is that it is really broken up into four seperate RPGs , one for each of the four exhibits you must enter . In starting each one , your character is transported with no objects to use , and experience level 1 . One exhibits traps you inside a multi-level ancient Egyptian pyramid which you must escape by fighting , mapping and puzzle solving . Another exhibit traps you in a mine that has been taken over by creeping plant vines and pods , while the local humans have been transformed into plant zombies . This is a single level maze that requires you to rescue some humans , kill the head plant alien , and figuere out how to kill the very tuff plant zombies that are always showing up . This is perhaps the most horrifying exhibit . Another exhibit puts you into Jack The Ripper England where you appear by the corpse of a fresh Ripper victim , and of course the police think you are responsible . You must avoid police and angry mobs to unravel the mystery of The Ripper and meet him face to face - but first get a disquise . The last exhibit pus you in a graveyard where most of the challenge is in learning to stop the almost indestructible zombies . Over all the VGA graphics and music are very effective in setting a creepy tone for the game , as was the case for the Elvira games , though gameplay is much improved and makes for a much more enjoyable game . I heartily recommend it for RPG and Horror fans . ********************************************************* - All prices include shipping . - All games are in excellent condition unless otherwise stated . - US buyers only please . - All games will be shipped inside a box with packing , insured , priority USPS . - All games include all original materials including box , manual , disks , and registration unless otherwise noted .

No motherboard can sense the speed of the RAM installed , unless you call failing as a sort of auto-sense . This is how you can sometimes use '' slower '' RAM in a machine . You either set the number of wait states to accomodate the slow RAM ( in which case , all memory will run at that slower rate ) or you reduce the wait states and take the chance that the slower RAM will act like faster RAM and you wo n't crash . Putting faster RAM in wo n't speed things up unless you tell the machine it has faster RAM . Mixing fast and slow RAM will not help you if you have to keep the bus slowed down to accomodate slow RAM .

There it is collected by a cleaning crew using shop vacs and is then reformed into pellets for reactor use the next day . Cooling towers are a lot taller than they really need to be . Power companies are forced to make them that tall by some enviromental law that requires the raw uranium emisions to be held to under 1 % . This law is now under attack by lawyers arguing that the 1 % should be measured at the edge of the property rather than the edge of the cooling tower .

Unfortunately I have located only one of them ( in the lower front corner ) . I would like to know , if there are any other such jumpers and possibly where they are located . Problem 2 : My hard disks refuse to boot . With my two SCSI HD 's ( Rodime , Miniscribe ) I get a message 'Missing operating system ' , even though the disks have been formatted with the same controller and they damn sure have an operating system on them . If I boot from a Quantum I might get as far as getting the MS-DOS version information . This might of course be due to incombatible memory drivers . Are there any jumpers that could affect the HD causing such errors ?

A little-known fact is that the Chevrolet Co. actually took over GM !

Stuff deleted ... I am sorry to report that in Southern California it was a sick sport for a while to drop concrete blocks from the overpasses onto the freeway . Several persons were killed when said blocks came through their windshields . Many overpass bridges are now fenced , and they have made it illegal to loiter on such bridges ( as if that would stop such people ) . Yet many bridges are NOT fenced . I always look up at a bridge while I still have time to take evasive action even though this *sport* has not reached us here in Fresno . ___________________________________________________________________ Greg_Lewis @ csufresno.edu Photojournalism sequence , Department of Journalism CSU Fresno , Fresno , CA 93740

They have a streak of meanness that runs much deeper and stronger than anything I ever experienced even during the height of the 60 's racial struggles . I am absolutely convinced that there are kids out there today that have no concept of right and wrong , but have the human intelligence which is turning them into the greatest predators that have ever walked the earth . They will prevail unless the rest of humanity decides that it is in their best interest to stand up against these feral humans , and for individuals to start taking some responsibility for their own protection . In a state in which the individuals turn to the authorities and police for protection , the police and government is soon composed of the very feral humans that they originally sought protection from .

What you may not be taking into account is that the JP is no longer representative of the mainstream in Israel . It was purchased a few years ago and in the battle for control , most of the liberal and left-wing reporters walked out . The new owner stated in the past , more than once , that the JP 's task should be geared towards explaining and promoting Israel 's position , more than attacking the gov't ( Likud at the time ) .

If I read you right , you 're saying in essence that , with a larger economy , nations will have more discretionary funds to *waste* on a lunar facility . That was certainly partially the case with Apollo , but real Lunar colonies will probably require a continuing military , scientific , or commercial reason for being rather than just a `` we have the money , why not ? '' approach . It 's conceivable that Luna will have a military purpose , it 's possible that Luna will have a commercial purpose , but it 's most likely that Luna will only have a scientific purpose for the next several hundred years at least . Therefore , Lunar bases should be predicated on funding levels little different from those found for Antarctic bases . Can you put a 200 person base on the Moon for $ 30 million a year ?

What is it ? What causes it ? Could it be caused by a > nervous breakdown ? > Obesssive Compulsive Disorder ( not to be confused with Obsessive Compulsive _Personality_ Disorder ! ) is an acute anxiety disorder characterized by either obsessions ( persistent intrusive thoughts that cause anxiety when not entertained ) , or compulsions ( repetitive , ritualistic actions that similarly cause intense psychological discomfort when resisted ) . OCD is often associated with certain forms of depression . Examples of obsessive thoughts are repeated impulses to kill a loved one ( though not accompanied by anger ) , or a religious person having recurrent blasphemous thoughts . Generally , the individual attempts to ignore or suppress the intrusive thoughts by engaging in other activities . The individual realizes that the thoughts originate from the own mind , rather than being from an external source . Examples of compulsive actions are constant repetitive hand washing , or other activity that is not realistically related to alleviating a source of the anxiety . In OCD , the obsessions or compulsions are highly distressing to the individual , take an hour or more per day , and significantly impair their daily routine and social relationships . Treatments include psychotherapy , behavioral methods , and sometimes certain anti-depressants which have recently been found effective in alleviating obsessions and compulsions .

Clinton President of the United States of America Mr. President : I am writing to express my utter outrage at the conduct of various government agencies in regards to the tragedy in Waco . I DEMAND the dismissal or resignation of Lloyd Bensen , Secretary of the Treasury , who bears responsibility for the initial helicopter and grenade attack by the ATF against the Branch Davidians , and of Janet Reno , who authorized the final assault on the very day that we were commemorating the Warsaw ghetto revolt . And I would truly appreciate it if you would make sure something like this never happens again on your watch . Respectfully yours , Kenneth D. Whitehead ___________________________________________________________________________ Get involved , gang . It 's your Republic . Let 's take it back . ************************************************************************** * I will be much more willing to believe the Government 's side of the * * Waco story AFTER we are allowed to hear from the survivors .

As a result of the spacecraft entering Contingency Mode on April 9 , all payload instruments were automatically powered off by on-board fault protection software . Gamma Ray Spectrometer Random Access Memory was successfully reloaded on Monday , April 19 . To prepare for Magnetometer Calibrations which were rescheduled for execution in Flight Sequence C9 on Tuesday and Wednesday of next week , a reload of Payload Data System Random Access Memory will take place this morning beginning at 10:30 AM . Over this weekend , the Flight Team will send real-time commands to perform Differential One-Way Ranging to obtain additional data for analysis by the Navigation Team . Radio Science Ultra Stable Oscillator testing will take place on Monday . The Flight Sequence C9 uplink will occur on Sunday , April 25 , with activation at Midnight , Monday evening April 26 . C9 has been modified to include Magnetometer Calibrations which could not be performed in C8 due to Contingency Mode entry on April 9 . These Magnetometer instrument calibrations will allow the instrument team to better characterize the spacecraft-generated magnetic field and its effect on their instrument . This information is critical to Martian magnetic field measurements which occur during approach and mapping phases . MAG Cals will require the sequence to command the spacecraft out of Array Normal Spin state and perform slew and roll maneuvers to provide the MAG team data points in varying spacecraft attitudes and orientations . Today , the spacecraft is 22,971,250 km ( 14,273,673 mi . ) from Mars travelling at a velocity of 2.09 kilometers/second ( 4,677 mph ) with respect to Mars . One-way light time is approximately 10 minutes , 38 seconds . ___ _____ ___ /_ /| /____/ \ /_ /| Ron Baalke | baalke @ kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov | | | | __ \ /| | | | Jet Propulsion Lab | ___| | | | |__ ) |/ | | |__ M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand /___| | | | ___/ | |/__ /| Pasadena , CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and |_____|/ |_|/ |_____|/ | part vegetable .

There were an assortment of firmware problems , but that is pretty much expected with any FAX/modem talking with a different FAX or modem which may have also been revised or is new . I 'm pretty much oblivious to any current firmware problems , so you 'll have to get it from someone else . However , I can tell you to stay clear of any board which uses the Rockwell MPU ( as opposed to the DPU ) for an internal implementation . This is because the MPU used `` speed buffering '' instead of having a 16550 interface . Without the 550 interface , the number of interrupts are still the same and thus may get dropped under multitasking conditions ( like in windows ) . As far as I know , the `` speed buffering '' works OK for external modems if a 550 is used on the internal serial port board . Hope this helps ...

I think the original poster meant opening the mouse , not just releasing the ball and getting to the rollers . I found that on the original ADB mouse , sometimes unscrewing the two halves allowed for easier cleaning . If the original poster has his answer , I 'll ask : How do you open the new ergonomic mouse ? By open , I mean split the two halves to get at the guts . It is n't obvious to me based on the 5 minute look I spent with one at the office yesterday as there are no visible screw heads . Mark

The cads ! The fact that this is precisely what the US was up to of course is not mentioned .

Arab papers continued | > to portray Iraq and Libya as being unfairly treated by the UN while | > Israel remains unpunished for resolutions which it has violated . In the case of Lybia there is the problem that the US only decided that Gadffii ordered the bombing after it needed to make peace with damascus during the gulf war . One day the US is certain that its Syria , the next Lybia . For a strange reason the US will not provide evidence to Lybian courts for extradition proceedings . Faced with similar demands the USA would reject them as would any other country . | > Concerning Northern Ireland , President Clinton 's message of | > consolation to the victims of the Warrington bombing was seen in | > British tabloids as signalling a tougher stance by the American | > government against violence by the IRA . The word is `` terrorism '' . The problem is that after the behaviour of George Bush the USA has an image abroad as doing precisely what it likes and is in its own interests then comming out with a Dysney scripted sugary justification repeating a fitting combination of the words `` freedom '' `` dignity '' `` democaracy '' or of `` terrorism '' `` dictatorship '' etc as appropriate . The USA could go quite far to mend the bridges with Iran . The people there are rather pissed off because the USA first supported the Shah who they loathed and then supported Saddam when he mounted an unprovoked attack . Hardly surprizing after the embassy hostage crisis but Iran is meant to be the country run by unreasonable bigots not the USA so if there is to be movement it would be easier for the USA to move . First off they could recognise Iraqu 's responsibility in initiating the Iran/Iraq war . Providing technical assistance to Iran to get it 's oil production back up to capacity would also be a smart move , at the moment Iran is above it 's OPEC ceiling . If they had extra capacity they would use it and bring down the oild price further which is in our interests . The Iranian clerics would have an interest in seeking a raprochment simply because a permanent war footing is debilitating . They also need western technology . Phill Hallam-Baker

Didja see that one Rosie roofed against Roy in last year 's playoffs ? Courtnall/Ranford for Andy Moog ( Oilers ) . A wash.

Janney is an enormous talent and a personable guy , the the Bruins play in Adam 's Division . Enough said ? So , even if you count the Esposito/Vadnais/Ratelle/Park/I do n't remember who else ( Joe Zanussi ? ) trade as a double minus , Harry the Horse trader comes out on top . I submit that the Bruins are always good because of Harry , not in spite of him . BTW , do you really think the Habs will bounce back next season .

Yeah , and it 's also true most long complicated sequences of events , calculations , or big computer programs in general . I do n't argue that you can get similar and maybe useful results from fractals , I just question whether you > should < . The fractal fiends seem to be saying that any part of a system that we ca n't model should be replaced with a random number generator . That has been useful , for instance , in making data more palatable to human perception or for torture testing the rest of the system , but I don't think it has much to do with fractals , and I certainly would rather that the model be improved in a more explicable manner . I guess I just have n't seen all these earth-shaking fractal models that explain and correlate to the universe as it actually exists . I really hope I do , but I 'm not holding my self-similar breath . > There is one other thing that fractals are good for : fractal > image compression . Uh huh . I 'll believe it when I see it . I 've been chasing fractal compression for a few years , and I still do n't believe in it . If it 's so great , how come we do n't see it competing with JPEG ? 'Cause it ca n't , I 'll wager . Actually , I have wagered , I quit trying to make fractal compression work- and I was trying- because I do n't think it 's a reasonable alternative to other techniques . It is neat , though . : - ) I 'll reiterate my disbelief that everything is fractal . That 's why I do n't think fractal compression as it is widely explained is practical . I know Barnsley and Sloan have some tricks up their sleeves that make their demos work , but I do n't see anyone using it in a real product . It 's been six years since Iterated Systems was formed , right ? `` There are always going to be questions until there 's a product out there , '' Sloan replies . The company plans to ship its first encoding devices in the summer , he says . In March , Iterated Systems will have the other half of the system : the decoders . - Scientific American , March 1990 , page 77 Allen B ( Do n't even get me started : - ) )

Canon ( from the latin ) means a rule . If we say that a rule is open then its a rule made to be broken . There is an issue also of measurement against a rule . Thus the words that are spoken need to be compared against the rule/canon but not added to the canon . Is new revelation necessary ? Topical , current , personal revelation I 'd say is necessary . New revelation for all people for all times is not necessary as we have that in Scripture . You also seem to confuse canon with scripture . Scripture may speak of itself being open - ie God speaking today . It would speak that it is closed in the sense that the canon is unchangeable . ( Though the concept of canon is later historically . ) > Also interesting to note is that some so called prophecies are nothing new > but rather an inspired translation of scripture .

If prophecy is meant to encourage , exhort or correct then is an overlap with scripture . If prophecy is meant to bring a ` word ' of the form `` the man you live with is not your husband '' then that is knowledge . Yet the exact words their are scripture .

The net result of this is that you _can't_ use a gun to protect yourself from bears ( or psychos ) in the National Parks . Instead , one has to be sensitive to the dangers and annoyances of hiking in bear country , and take the appropriate precautions .

So , doing the math on one such comparitive font file : TTF Times = 83260 bytes/1.4 = 59471 bytes ( compressed ) PFB Times = 51549 bytes/1.1 = 46862 bytes ( Compressed ) You still win out , even if the ATM Times font *isn't* compressed .

EDT THE PRESIDENT : Good morning . My voice is coming to you this morning through the facilities of the oldest radio station in America , KDKA in Pittsburgh . I 'm visiting the city to meet personally with citizens here to discuss my plans for jobs , health care and the economy . But I wanted first to do my weekly broadcast with the American people . I 'm told this station first broadcast in 1920 when it reported that year 's presidential elections . Over the past seven decades presidents have found ways to keep in touch with the people , from whistle-stop tours to fire-side chats to the bus tour that I adopted , along with Vice President Gore , in last year 's campaign . Every Saturday morning I take this time to talk with you , my fellow Americans , about the problems on your minds and what I 'm doing to try and solve them . It 's my way of reporting to you and of giving you a way to hold me accountable . You sent me to Washington to get our government and economy moving after years of paralysis and policy and a bad experiment with trickle-down economics . You know how important it is for us to make bold , comprehensive changes in the way we do business . We live in a competitive global economy . Nations rise and fall on the skills of their workers , the competitiveness of their companies , the imagination of their industries , and the cooperative experience and spirit that exists between business , labor and government . Although many of the economies of the industrialized world are now suffering from slow growth , they've made many of the smart investments and the tough choices which our government has for too long ignored . That 's why many of them have been moving ahead and too many of our people have been falling behind . We have an economy today that even when it grows is not producing new jobs . We 've increased the debt of our nation by four times over the last 12 years , and we do n't have much to show for it . We know that wages of most working people have stopped rising , that most people are working longer work weeks and that too many families can no longer afford the escalating cost of health care . But we also know that , given the right tools , the right incentives and the right encouragement , our workers and businesses can make the kinds of products and profits our economy needs to expand opportunity and to make our communities better places to live . In many critical products today Americans are the low cost , high quality producers . Our task is to make sure that we create more of those kinds of jobs . Just two months ago I gave Congress my plan for long-term jobs and economic growth . It changes the old priorities in Washington and puts our emphasis where it needs to be -- on people 's real needs , on increasing investments and jobs and education , on cutting the federal deficit , on stopping the waste which pays no dividends , and redirecting our precious resources toward investment that creates jobs now and lays the groundwork for robust economic growth in the future . These new directions passed the Congress in record time and created a new sense of hope and opportunity in our country . Then the jobs plan I presented to Congress , which would create hundreds of thousands of jobs , most of them in the private sector in 1993 and 1994 , passed the House of Representatives . It now has the support of a majority of the United States Senate . But it 's been held up by a filibuster of a minority in the Senate , just 43 senators . They blocked a vote that they know would result in the passage of our bill and the creation of jobs . The issue is n't politics ; the issue is people . Millions of Americans are waiting for this legislation and counting on it , counting on us in Washington . But the jobs bill has been grounded by gridlock . I know the American people are tired of business as usual and politics as usual . I know they do n't want us to spin or wheels . They want the recovery to get moving . So I have taken a first step to break this gridlock and gone the extra mile . Yesterday I offered to cut the size of this plan by 25 percent -- from $ 16 billion to $ 12 billion . It 's not what I 'd hoped for . With 16 million Americans looking for full-time work , I simply ca n't let the bill languish when I know that even a compromise bill will mean hundreds of thousands of jobs for our people . The mandate is to act to achieve change and move the country forward . By taking this initiative in the face of an unrelenting Senate talkathon , I think we can respond to your mandate and achieve a significant portion of our original goals . First , we want to keep the programs as much as possible that are needed to generate jobs and meet human needs , including highway and road construction , summer jobs for young people , immunization for children , construction of waste water sites , and aid to small businesses . We also want to keep funding for extended unemployment compensation benefits , for people who have been unemployed for a long time because the economy isn't creating jobs . Second , I 've recommended that all the other programs in the bill be cut across-the-board by a little more than 40 percent . And third , I 've recommended a new element in this program to help us immediately start our attempt to fight against crime by providing $ 200 million for cities and towns to rehire police officers who lost their jobs during the recession and put them back to work protecting our people . I 'm also going to fight for a tough crime bill because the people of this country need it and deserve it . Now , the people who are filibustering this bill -- the Republican senators -- say they wo n't vote for it because it increases deficit spending , because there 's extra spending this year that has n't already been approved . That sounds reasonable , does n't it ? Here 's what they do n't say . This program is more than paid for by budget cuts over my five-year budget , and this budget is well within the spending limits already approved by the Congress this year . It 's amazing to me that many of these same senators who are filibustering the bill voted during the previous administration for billions of dollars of the same kind of emergency spending , and much of it was not designed to put the American people to work . This is not about deficit spending . We have offered a plan to cut the deficit . This is about where your priorities are -- on people or on politics . Keep in mind that our jobs bill is paid for dollar for dollar . It is paid for by budget cuts . And it 's the soundest investment we can now make for ourselves and our children . I urge all Americans to take another look at this jobs and investment program ; to consider again the benefits for all of us when we 've helped make more American partners working to ensure the future of our nation and the strength of our economy . You know , if every American who wanted a job had one , we would n't have a lot of the other problems we have in this country today . This bill is not a miracle , it 's a modest first step to try to set off a job creation explosion in this country again . But it 's a step we ought to take . And it is fully paid for over the life of our budget . Tell your lawmakers what you think . Tell them how important the bill is . If it passes , we 'll all be winners . Good morning , and thank you for listening . END 10:11 A.M. EDT

This seems to be a popular scam with dealers . Last month my brother bought a new Audi 90 series quatro from a local dealer . They came back with the final price , tax and all , and he added it up for himself . There happened to be an extra $ 300 tagged on under the tax part .

I admit that I do not have a handle on Greek grammar , and thus confused `` kleros '' , the second to last word in Acts 1:17 as being the plot of land discussed . In actuality it is `` chorion '' , which is the last word Acts 1:18 . Unfortunately my Greek dictionary does not discuss `` chorion '' so I can not report as to the nuances of the word .

'' So which is it Mr DeCenso ? Do you find the exegisis convincing or not ? ) '' MY REPLY ... One of my purposes in debating these alleged contradictions with you and others is to diseminate many different views of possible reconciliations raised by various Bible scholars and students alike . When I present MY VIEWS , I will clearly distinguish them from now on . DB ... '' Of course without Archer and Bullinger we find that Mr DeCenso has presented no Greek exegisis at all , and Mr DeCenso has made a big thing about my not referring back to the actual Greek . Thus we find this demand on his part for quality Greek exegisis to be a hypocritical requirement . '' MY REPLY ... Good point . But in your declaring that these passages are contradictory , you have produced only superficial reasonings and observations . Nor have you dug deeper . I 'm glad you have begun in this post . I will begin Greek studies on these passages in more depth than I thought necessary , as well . DB ... '' It would be appropriate to look at what Mr DeCenso has actually USED as evidence . Now we know what he claims for a standard , as he has stated it often enough : > ( a ) the text itself > ( b ) parallel passages > ( c ) other pertinent Scriptures > ( d ) historical context > ( e ) historical content > ( f ) other pertinent historical info > ( g ) cultural context > ( h ) cultural content > ( i ) other pertinent cultural info > ( j ) grammatical construction > ( k ) Hebrew and Greek word studies > ( l ) etc . But are these actual standards he has used , or simply empty hyperbole . Let's see , he has used ( a ) , and since he is trying to reconcile it to other passages , we see that he has also used ( b ) . On the other hand he has presented no use of : ( d ) historical context or ( e ) historical content or ( f ) other pertinent historical info or ( g ) cultural context or ( h ) cultural content or ( i ) other pertinent cultural info or ( j ) grammatical construction or even ( k ) Hebrew and Greek word studies [ remember , Archer and Bullinger do n't count ] Thus we find his vaunted criteria for exegisis is just empty mouthings . '' MY REPLY ... Question : Do you find such criteria important ? If so , do you plan on starting to use them to the best of your ability , or will you continue to present shallow observations ( I do n't mean this in a bad way ) . At this point in our _debates_ , I have not found it necessary to present a total exegetical analysis of these passages , since we seem to keep beating around the bush and not getting into the core of the verses . I do not believe it necessary to use many of the above criteria to refute your arguments re : Judas in Acts and Matthew , but I will do my best from this point on to use several of the above criteria , since you desire me to . I hope you will also . It will greatly enhance our study of these passages . DB ... '' The only thing he has actually used , beyond the passage itself , is any other passage . Thus Mr DeCenso should be honest and note that most of his list is red herring and his only real criteria seems to be : > ( a ) the text itself > ( b ) parallel passages MY REPLY ... The reason is simple ... you are mistating the passages . You claim that the PASSAGES contradict one another ; I do not see the PASSAGES contradicting one another . ( 1 ) They may very well be complimentary , as many scholarly sources mention ; ( 2 ) Matthew may not be presenting Judas ' death , as you claim . But we 'll look at your defense of this later . Also , the `` reward of iniquity '' in the Acts PASSAGE may not be the 30 pieces of silver in Matthew 's PASSAGES . ( Although you have a valiant attempt later at stating why you believe it is ) . At this beginning stages in our debates , we are laying some Scriptural groundwork , which will be expanded upon through deeper exegesis . DB ... '' Of course the only reason I can see to so drastically reinterpret a passage as he has done with Judas ' death , is to make it agree with another passage so that both could be considered correct . '' MY REPLY ... One of the reasons I have given a different exegetical view of the passages is that you seem to think the majority of scholarship is wrong in concluding these passages are complimentary . However , I see no problem in Tony Rose's explanation of Judas ' death ... _____________________________________________________________________ HOW WOULD YOU EXPLAIN THE INACCURACY BETWEEN JUDAS HANGING HIMSELF IN MATTHEW 27:5 AND `` FALLING HEADLONG HE BURST OPEN '' ============================================================= This question of the manner in which Judas died is one with which we are constantly confronted in our travels . Many people point to the apparent discrepancy in the two accounts as an obvious , irreconcilable error . Some have gone so far as to say that the idea of an inerrant Bible is destroyed by these contradictory accounts . However , this is not the case at all . Matthew relates that Judas hanged himself , while Peter tells us he fell and was crushed by the impact . The two statements are indeed different , but do they necessarily contradict each other ? Matthew does not say that Judas did not fall ; neither does Peter say that Judas did not hang himself . This is not a matter of one person calling something black and the other person calling it white . Both accounts can be true and supplementary . A possible reconstruction would be this : Judas hanged himself on a tree on the edge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of Hinnom . After he hung there for some time , the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and Judas fell down the ledge , mangling his body in the process . The fall could have been before *or* after death as either would fit this explanation . This possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the valley of Hinnom is examined . From the bottom of the valley , you can see rocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular . There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom . Therefore , it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks on this way down , tearing his body open . It is important to remember that we are not told how long Judas remained hanging from the tree or how advanced was the decomposition of his body before his fall . Louis Gaussen relates a story of a man who was determined to kill himself . This individual placed himself on the sill of a high window and pointed a pistol at his head . He then pulled the trigger and leaped from the window at the same time . On the other hand , a person could say that this man took his life by shooting himself , while another could rightly contend he committed suicide by jumping form the tall building . In this case , both are true , as both are true in the case of Matthew 's and Peter 's accounts of the death of Judas . It is merely a situation of different perspectives of the same event . _____________________________________________________________________ Your only reason for rejecting this is , I believe , your attempt to discredit inerrancy . You have n't related how this is IMPOSSIBLE or highly unlikely . Here 's what you said in an earlier post ... _____________________________________________________________________ DB [ quoting Tony Rose ] ... > There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom . > Therefore , it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks > on this way down , tearing his body open . It is important to remember that we > ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ > are not told how long Judas remained hanging from the tree or how advanced > ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ > was the decomposition of his body before his fall . `` The added text in this version is so heavy that , assuming you are truly so opposed to such tactics , you should find it not credible . But you seem to find Tony Rose 's eisegesis satisfactory , while clearly rejecting David Joslin 's . '' _____________________________________________________________________ Here , you discredit Tony 's explanation based on what you deem too `` heavy '' for the passages . But you have n't addressed why you feel that way . You can say it 's a vain attempt to reconcile the contradiction , but that does n't tell me it did n't happen , nor have you shown why you reject that possibility . Questions : Is Matthew lying or is Luke lying ? Or are they both lying ? Or are either or both of them misinformed ? Why do you think there is such an alleged contradiction ? I do not think you have ever told us what you believe in this respect . DB ... '' At present though , Mr DeCenso only asks two questions of me : > ( 1 ) You claim Acts and Matthew contradict one another in representing Judas' > death . I ask you again to provide evidence that Matthew stated Judas > died in the hanging . > ( 2 ) You claim that the 30 pieces of silver in Matthew that Judas threw down > in the temple and the chief priests used , is the `` reward of iniquity '' > in Acts that pictures Judas in some way purchasing a field with ; > therefore there is a contradiction . Prove that the 30 pieces of silver > and the `` reward of iniquity '' are one and the same . Actually I find question ( 1 ) to be a rather stupid request , but I will answer it because he now restricts himself to two points . First I would point out that hanging is a very efficient manner for ending a life . In fact it is a bit of a fluke when someone survives hanging ( except in fantasy cowboy movies ) , and even then it usually referred to as an attempted hanging . '' MY REPLY ... I work at an agency that investigates child abuse and neglect . Today , I got a call re : a child that attempted suicide by hanging himself because his mother is on crack . He failed in his attempt and is in a child 's psych ward at a local hospital . Hanging attempts are not always successful . To assume that because most hangings are successful , this one was also is '' begging the question '' , if I may quote you . [ Last night , listening to _The Bible Answer Man_ broadcast , The Christian Research Institute 's show , one of the scholars on there used several of these terms that you use . I am not all that familiar with them . The man on the BAM show teaches Comparative Religion and Logic . It was interesting ] DB ... '' This is so prevalent that , so that to say a man hung himself with no other qualifiers is synonymous with stating that he killed himself . '' MY REPLY ... Qualifiers are important at times , as we 'll see in an OT passage I 'll mention below . Does hanging ALWAYS have this outcome ? Did Matthew , who is the only source we have re : Judas hanging himself , state that Judas died as a result ? To say it's synonymous means it has the same meaning as . A boy ( age 14 ) hung himself . But he lived . This is only one of probably thousands of documented cases we can discover . DB ... '' Now I am not alone in this thought ; in fact , since Mr DeCenso so respects Christian scholarly ( including Greek scholars ) opinion , I did some research . '' MY REPLY ... Thank you , Dave . DB ... '' Interestingly , not one of the Christian references I read , interpreted the hanging as being anything but a fatal suicide . ^^^^^^^^^^^ MY REPLY ... [ ^^^ above , mine ] So it 's OK to use Christian sources to back your points ? What about Tony's position . Do you value it or even consider it as a valid possibility ? Also , is it possible that the sources you read may be wrong , or lying , or deceived in other parts of their books ? If so , should we do , as we have done with Archer , toss them to the side and not value anything they say , including their `` interpretation '' of the hanging of Judas ? I am sure _you_ would find some errors and maybe even some deception in those sources . You also noted they `` interpreted '' the hanging as meaning he died . Although that is very possibly true , do you find that in the text itself ? Remember , that 's the first criteria we must examine . DB ... '' This included : `` The Biblical Knowledge Commentary '' by Woodward and Zuck '' MY REPLY ... Which I own . It 's a good source of commentary info . But not inerrant . DB ... `` The Interpreters on Volume Commentary on the Bible '' by Laydon `` The one volume Bible Commentary '' by J R Dunelow `` Word meanings of the Testament '' Ralph Earl `` The Abingdon Bible Commentary '' published by Abingdon `` Harpers Bible Commentary '' by William Neal ( Actually I could have presented many more as well ) MY REPLY ... I appreciate your doing this research , Dave . Maybe we are getting somewhere in how we both should approach these alleged contradictions - more in depth study . DB ... '' In each case , these references specifically describe that the interpretation of Matt 27:5 as successful , suicide and thus I can only conclude that the ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Greek word `` apagchw '' ( ie : hang oneself ) is translated as a successful hanging . '' MY REPLY ... [ ^^^ above , mine ] No you ca n't only conclude this , although , as Tony says , this was a highly probable outcome . But Matthew does not state death as being a result . The Greek word is APAGCHO . Matthew 27:5 is it 's only occurrence in the New Testament . In the Septuagint ( the Greek translation of the OT used at the time of Jesus ) , it 's only used in 2 Samuel 17:23 : `` Now when Ahithophel saw that his advice was not followed , he saddled a donkey , and arose and went home to his house , to his city . Then he put his household in order , and hanged himself , and died ; and he was buried in his father 's tomb . '' ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Notice that not only is it stated that Ahithophel `` hanged himself '' [ Gr . Sept. , APAGCHO ] , but it explicitly adds , `` and died '' . Here we have no doubt of the result . In Matthew , we are not explicitly told Judas died . Also , there is nothing in the Greek to suggest success or failure . It simply means `` hang oneself '' . DB ... '' But Mr DeCenso , you are more than welcome to disagree and show more reputable ^^^^^^^^^ Christian scholars that insist that the hanging was not successful . '' MY REPLY ... [ ^^^above , mine ] '' Reputable '' ? You mean ones that have never erred ? As far as insisting that the hanging was unsuccessful , that ca n't be done , even by me . ^^^^^^^^^ As I said in an earlier post ... _____________________________________________________________________ Although I still agree with Tony 's exegesis as being the most probable explanation regarding Judas ' death ( taking into account several criteria ) , I 've recently noticed some new things in Matthew . MAT 27:5-8 Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed , and went and hanged himself . But the chief priests took the silver pieces and said , `` It is not lawful to put them into the treasury , because they are the price of blood . '' And they consulted together and bought with them the potter's field , to bury strangers in . Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day . First of all , notice that the text does not say that Judas died as a result of hanging . All it says is that he `` went and hanged himself . '' Luke however , in Acts , tells us that `` and falling headlong , he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out . '' This is a pretty clear indication ( along with the other details given in Acts - Peter 's speech , the need to pick a new apostle , etc . ) that at least after Judas ' fall , he was dead . So the whole concept that ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Matthew and Luke both recount Judas ' death is highly probable , but not clear ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ cut . ^^^ _____________________________________________________________________ I also wrote ... _____________________________________________________________________ MY REPLY ... Here we have a stickler , Dave , that I have to say I just recently noticed . Let 's look at the passage in Matthew : MAT 27:4 saying , `` I have sinned by betraying innocent blood . '' And they said , '' What is that to us ? You see to it ! '' MAT 27:5 Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed , and went and hanged himself . MAT 27:6 But the chief priests took the silver pieces and said , `` It is not lawful to put them into the treasury , because they are the price of blood . '' MAT 27:7 And they consulted together and bought with them the potter 's field , to bury strangers in . MAT 27:8 Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day . Notice verse 5 ... '' Then he ... went and hanged himself . '' Matthew does not say Judas died , does it ? Should we assume he died as a result of the hanging ? ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ What does Acts say ? ACT 1:18 ( Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity ; and falling headlong , he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out . ACT 1:20 `` For it is written in the book of Psalms : 'Let his dwelling place be desolate , And let no one live in it ' ; and , 'Let another take his office . ' Here we may have a graphic explanation of Judas ' death ... .So , my line of reasoning to dispel your contradiction myth re : the `` two '' accounts of Judas' death is this ... Matthew does n't necessarily explain how Judas died ; he does ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ say Judas `` hanged himself '' , but he did n't specifically say Judas died in the hanging incident . ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ However , Acts seems to show us his graphic demise . Therefore , there is no contradiction between Matthew and Acts re : Judas ' ` death ' . ... ... . MY REPLY ... ... we do know from Matthew that he did hang himself and Acts probably records his death . Although it 's possible and plausible that he fell from the hanging and hit some rocks , thereby bursting open , I can no longer assume that to be the case . Therefore , no contradiction . Matthew did not say Judas died as a ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ result of the hanging , did he ? Most scholars believe he probably did , but ... ? ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ______________________________________________________________________ I quoted all that to show that I highly regard the scholars ' explanations , but in looking at the texts initially , we ca n't assume Judas died . It is , however , highly probable . ^^^^^^ DB ... '' By the way , while all agree that Judas died from the hanging , the books had different ways of dealing with the contradiction we are discussing . One simply ignored it entirely and simply referred back to Matthew 's version as the correct version in both Matt and Acts . `` The Biblical Knowledge Commentary '' suggested the hypotheses that Judas hung and then when he rotted , his belly exploded ( which does n't explain his headlong fall ) , or that his branch or rope broke , and he fell to his death and his gut gushed out ( which does n't explain how a hanging man , would fall headlong rather than feet first ) . '' MY REPLY ... The outcome of any fall is dependent upon many factors ... how high the person was suspended before the fall , any obstructions such as tree branches that may have deviated the fall , how steep an incline of rocky surfaces the victim fell upon , thus possibly rolling or bouncing of several rocks , etc . In a superficial examination of the Acts passage and the Matthew passage , we are not given a lot of info on the geographical specifics , but Tony in the above quoted post gave us some ... _____________________________________________________________________ A possible reconstruction would be this : Judas hanged himself on a tree on the edge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of Hinnom . After he hung there for some time , the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and Judas fell down the ledge , mangling his body in the process . The fall could have been before *or* after death as either would fit this explanation . This possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the valley of Hinnom is examined . From the bottom of the valley , you can see rocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular . There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom . Therefore , it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks on this way down , tearing his body open . _____________________________________________________________________ DB ... Now truthfully , I do not see what is comforting about Matthew confusing the source of the Potter 's field prophesy , but on the other hand the author is correct : Matthew does make that confusion . Of course a Biblical inerrantist who claim that every word of the Bible is guaranteed true by God , will have to thereby add one more contradiction to the death of Judas ( ie : where the prophesy of the Potter 's field came from ) . '' MY REPLY ... Please , when we are done with this study on his death , remind me to discuss this with you . DB ... As to your second question Mr DeCenso , you ask how we could be sure that the money with which Judas purchased the land , was indeed for the betrayal , rather than some other source . I would point out that in Acts , where it specifically mention `` the reward of iniquity '' [ Acts 1:18 ] , it also specifically mentions what act of iniquity they were talking about ( ie : Acts 1:16 `` ... concerning Judas who was guide to those who arrested Jesus. '' ) . Now I would point out that when the Bible describes an act of `` iniquity , '' and then immediately discusses `` *the* reward of iniquity , '' it would be rather inane to suggest that it was an action of iniquity other than the one discussed . '' MY REPLY ... Dave , we are getting somewhere , are n't we ! ACT 1:15 And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples ( altogether the number of names was about a hundred and twenty ) , and said , ACT 1:16 `` Men and brethren , this Scripture had to be fulfilled , which the Holy Spirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas , who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus ; ACT 1:17 `` for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry . '' ACT 1:18 ( Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity ; and falling headlong , he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out . ACT 1:19 And it became known to all those dwelling in Jerusalem ; so that field is called in their own language , Akel Dama , that is , Field of Blood . ) ACT 1:20 `` For it is written in the book of Psalms : 'Let his dwelling place be desolate , And let no one live in it ' ; and , 'Let another take his office . ' Notice that in verse 16 , the word `` iniquity '' is not used . Rather , it states that Judas `` became a guide to those who arrested Jesus '' . But the writer DID NOT stop there ... vs. 17 , `` for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry . '' What part did Judas play in their ministry ? ^^^^^^ JOH 12:6 This he said , not that he cared for the poor , but because he was a thief , and had the money box ; and he used to take what was put in it . JOH 13:29 For some thought , because Judas had the money box , that Jesus had said to him , `` Buy those things we need for the feast , '' or that he should give something to the poor . So , now we know what part Judas played - he was a treasurer , per se . Right after Peter stated that Judas played a part in this ministry ( treasurer , according to John ) , THEN Luke adds the parenthetical explanation of `` wages of iniquity '' - money that should have been put into the ministry , but was stolen by Judas to purchase a field . I believe this is a better exegetical explanation of what the `` wages of iniquity '' are . What do you think , Dave ? DB ... '' Now since I have given you clear answers ( and even references ) , perhaps you could unequivocally state what type of inerrantist you are ( instead of asking me what type I think you are , as you did to Mr Joslin ) .

Come you and look . ' 'No , dammit ! My stomach isn't-' 'One is a Turkish officer in uniform . Him you must see . ' `` We were under those trees by the mosque , in an open space ... . ' I do n't believe you , '' I said , but followed to a nail-studded door . The man pushed it ajar , then spurred away , leaving me to check on the corpse . I thought I should , this charge was so constant , so gritted my teeth and went inside . The place was cool but reeked of sodden ashes , and was dark at first , for its stone walls had only window slits . Rags strewed the mud floor around an iron tripod over embers that vented their smoke through roof beams black with soot . All looked bare and empty , but in an inner room flies buzzed . As the door swung shut behind me I saw they came from a man 's body lying face up , naked but for its grimy turban . He was about fifty years old by what was left of his face - a rifle butt had bashed an eye . The one left slanted , as with Tartars rather than with Turks . Any uniform once on him was gone , so I 'd no proof which he was , and quickly went out , gagging at the mess of his slashed genitals . '' p. 363 ( first paragraph ) . 'How many people lived there ? ' 'Oh , about eight hundred . ' He yawned . 'Did you see any Turk officers ? ' 'No , sir . I was in at dawn . All were Tartar civilians in mufti . ' `` The lieutenant dozed off , then I , but in the small hours a voice woke me - Dro 's . He stood in the starlight bawling out an officer . Anyone keelhauled so long and furiously I 'd never heard . Then abruptly Dro broke into laughter , quick and simple as child 's . Both were a cover for his sense of guilt , I thought , or hoped . For somehow , despite my boast of irreligion , Christian massacring 'infidels ' was more horrible than the reverse would have been . From daybreak on , Armenian villagers poured in from miles around ... .. The women plundered happily , chattering like ravens as they picked over the carcass of Djul . They hauled out every hovel 's chattels , the last scrap of food or cloth , and staggered away , packing pots , saddlebags , looms , even spinning-wheels . 'Thank you for a lot , Dro , ' I said to him back in camp . 'But now I must leave . ' ... We shook hands , the captain said ' A bientot , mon camarade . ' And for hours the old Molokan scout and I plodded north across parching plains .

Deep in tactics , they spoke Russian , but I got their contempt for Allied 'neutral ' zones and their distrust of promises made by tribal chiefs . A campaign shaped ; more raids on Moslem villages . '' p. 358 . `` It will be three hours to take , '' Dro told me . We 'd close in on three sides . `` The men on foot will not shoot , but use only the bayonets , '' Merrimanov said , jabbing a rifle in dumbshow . `` That is for morale , '' Dro put in . `` We must keep the Moslems in terror . '' `` Soldiers or civilians ? '' I asked . `` There is no difference , '' said Dro . `` All are armed , in uniform or not . '' `` But the women and children ? '' `` Will fly with the others as best they may . '' p. 360 . `` The ridges circled a wide expanse , its floors still . Hundreds of feet down , the fog held , solid as cotton flock . 'Djul lies under that , ' said Dro , pointing . 'Our men also attack from the other sides . ' Then , 'Whee-ee ! ' - his whistle lined up all at the rock edge . Bayonets clicked upon carbines . Over plunged Archo , his black haunches rippling ; then followed the staff , the horde - nose to tail , bellies taking the spur . Armenia in action seemed more like a pageant than war , even though I heard our Utica brass roar . As I watched from the height , it took ages for Djul to show clear . A tsing of machine-gun fire took over from the thumping batteries ; cattle lowed , dogs barked , invisible , while I ate a hunk of cheese and drank from a snow puddle . Mist at last folded upward as men shouted , at first heard faintly . The came a shrill wailing . Now among the cloud-streaks rose darker wisps - smoke . Red glimmered about house walls of stone or wattle , into dry weeds on roofs . A mosque stood in clump of trees , thick and green . Through crooked alleys on fire , horsemen were galloping after figures both mounted and on foot . 'Tartarski ! ' shouted the gunner by me . Others pantomimed them in escape over the rocks , while one twisted a bronze shell-nose , loaded , and yanked breech-cord , firing again and again . Shots wasted , I thought , when by afternoon I looked in vain for fallen branch or body . But these shots and the white bursts of shrapnel in the gullies drowned the women 's cries . At length all shooting petered out . I got on my horse and rode down toward Djul . It burned still but little flame showed now . The way was steep and tough , through dense scrub . Finally on flatter ground I came out suddenly , through alders , on smoldering houses . Across trampled wheat my brothers-in- arms were leading off animals , several calves and a lamb . '' p. 361 ( fourth paragraph ) . `` Corpses came next , the first a pretty child with straight black hair , large eyes . She looked about twelve years old . She lay in some stubble where meal lay scattered from the sack she 'd been toting . The bayonet had gone through her back , I judged , for blood around was scant . Between the breasts one clot , too small for a bullet wound , crusted her homespun dress . The next was a boy of ten or less , in rawhide jacket and knee-pants . He lay face down in the path by several huts . One arm reached out to the pewter bowl he 'd carried , now upset upon its dough . Steel had jabbed just below his neck , into the spine . There were grownups , too , I saw as I led the sorrel around . Djul was empty of the living till I looked up to see beside me Dro 's German-speaking colonel . He said all Tartars who had not escaped were dead . '' p. 358 . `` ... more stories of Armenian murdering Turks when the czarist troops fled north . My hosts told me of their duty here : to keep tabs on brigands , Turkish troop shifts , hidden arms , spies - Christian , Red or Tartar - coming in from Transcaucasus .

Question is , why channel TD > 12 and 32 ? The best antenna is one that will let out the most wave ( probably not the best explanation , but the rest makes sense ) A one wave will cancell itself out ( BTW no such beastie ) . The best is a 1/2 wave antenna , followed by 1/4 , then 1/8 etc . As for SWRing in , what you actually do is trim the antenna to the correct length for the specific wavelength you will be transmitting on . Since the wavelength varies with the channel you use , then it 's recommended to SWR in using the middle channel of those you are going to use . Anyway in the beginning of CB 's , all new antennas had to be SWR'ed in , nowdays manufactures trim the antennas almost spot on , so that there 's not much point in SWRing . Then again you may be a fanatic and whish to do it anyway . Cheers Peter T .

When you get your home brew receiver working , would you be willing to share it with the rest of us ? I always wanted to build my own but never have the time to fool around and design it . pin 1 : signal ground pin 2 : signal pin 3 : always hot +6 volts pin 4 : +6 volts , hot only when preamp is turned on pin 5 : infrared repeater connectors The infrared repeater jacks on the back of the preamp are not connected to anything inside the preamp except the 5 pin connector pin # 5 . There is a 150 ohm resistor between the two jacks , with a 1.5K from pin 5 to ground . The signal pin # 2 in the preamp is summed with the built in IR receiver . They use a chip called CX20106A and a BJT to amplify the signal . I would imagine the logical way would be to duplicate this circuit and use it as the external receiver .

As expected , very few of the candidates ( 3 of 13 ) responded , but they know we 're watching . Feel free to use any and all of these questions that strike your fancy or use them as inspiration for your own . ***** 1 . Would you be willing to state , in writing , that if you are publicly demonstrated to have violated your oath of office you would resign and never run for office again ? 2 . Under what circumstances do the rights of the group come before the rights of the individual ? 3 . Would you support a city charter amendment prohibiting the city government , its officials , agents , and employees from initiating force against any human being for any reason ? 4 . Please put the following list in order of precedence ( from lowest to highest ) : a ) city ordinance , b ) city resolution , c ) state law , d ) federal statute , e ) U.S. Constitution , f ) state constitution . 5 . Do you believe that it 's appropriate for any city official or employee to be paid more than his or her average private sector constituent ? 6 . Do you believe that involuntary contributions are a legitimate means of funding council programs ? 7 . Would you support a program recognizing the right of taxpayers to `` earmark '' their taxes ( either as `` must be used '' or `` must not be used '' ) for specific programs ? 8 . In the event that the candidate `` None of the Above '' were to win a city election , which option do you believe most appropriate ? a ) The candidate with the next highest vote total fills the office . b ) A special election is held to fill the office , with none of the previous candidates eligible to run again . c ) Let the office remain unfilled and unfunded until the next election . d ) Abolish the office . Please return your questionnaire to : [ address of your choice ] A signature and date line were added here . Thank you for taking the time to fill out this questionnaire . ****** The questionnaires were sent with self-addressed , stamped envelopes . P.S .

I was very interested in the technology demonstrated in this film for handling infectious diseases ( and similar toxic substances ) . Clearly they `` faked '' a lot of the computer & robotic technology ; certainly at the time it was made most of that was science fiction itself , let alone the idea of a `` space germ '' . Quite coincidentally [ actually this is what got me wanted to see the movie again ] I watched a segment on the otherwise awful _How'd They Do That ? _ dealing with a disease researcher at the CDC 's top lab . There was description of the elaborate security measures taken so that building will never be `` cracked '' so to speak by man or nature ( short of deliberate bombing from the air , perhaps ) . And the researchers used `` spacesuits '' similar to that in the film . I 'm curious what people think about this film -- short of `` silly '' . Is such a facility technically feasible today ?

The Command Loss Timer is a timer that does just what its name says ; it indicates to the probe that it has lost its data link for receiving commands . Upon expiration of the Command Loss Timer , I believe the probe starts a 'search for Earth ' sequence ( involving antenna pointing and attitude changes which consume fuel ) to try to reestablish communications . No-ops are sent periodically through those periods when there are no real commands to be sent , just so the probe knows that we have n't forgotten about it .

If you haven't seen Jesus 's light , your evil deeds simply have n't been exposed to the His light . You may shed some light on your own . Your human spirit shines at perhaps 1 candela . But the Holy Spirit shines at a Megacandela . The Holy Spirit can shine light into places inside us where we did n't even know existed . So do you see Jesus 's point ? Christians are not perfect . Nonchristians are not perfect . Nonchristians do not want to come into the Light of Jesus because they will see all the problems in their lives , and they will not like the sight . It is an ugly thing to see how far we have fallen from Jesus 's perspective . Do you think you want to know how really ignorant you are ? Do you think Brian Kendig wants to know ? Do you think I want to know ? Ego verses the truth , which do you choose ? > I 'm watching the news about a man who saw the light , and made > sure that the 19 children burned to death as part of his insight > into the light . I do n't think the world is that simple . And if > you act in such ways when you are enlighted , then I 'm a happy > man and I pray I will never receive such 'light ' . And I watched Koresh too , an imposter who thought he saw the light , who made sure that the 19 children burned to death , sadly , as part of his delusion . It is even sadder that the people who died with him chose to die with them , and that ignorance was their downfall to death . And Kent , do n't you bury yourself underneath a rock with an excuse like bringing up Koresh -- as if Koresh actually had truth in him . David Koresh was no light and no excuse for you to stay away from the real Jesus Christ . David Koresh , who claimed to be Jesus , was a fraud . It was obvious . David Koresh was born in America . Jesus was born in Bethlehem . Koresh wasn't even a good imposter having missed an obvious point as that . Jesus warned of such imposters in the end-times . David Koresh was n't anything new to Jesus . Jesus told us to be aware of imposters 2000 years ago . So the next time an imposter makes a scene and claims to be Jesus . Ask the obvious . Where were you born ? Was your mother 's name Mary ? If the Branch Davidians asked that simple question , they would have labeled Koresh a liar right from the start . The would n't have followed Koresh . They would n't have died . But look what happened . Their ignorance cost them their lives . Their choice to be ignorant cost them a lot . Kent , since you studied the Bible under Lutheranism , do you not remember what tactic Satan used to try to tempt Jesus ? Did not Satan quote the Bible out of context ? Do you remember what tactic the serpent of Genesis used to tempt Eve ? Did he not misquote God ? What Satan used on Eve and succeeded , was the same ploy he tried on Jesus . But in Jesus 's case , Jesus rebuked Satan back with the Bible _in_ context . It did n't work with Jesus . Does what Satan did to Eve in the Garden and what Satan tried to do with Jesus in the desert remind you of what Koresh did to his followers ? Who did Koresh emulate ? Who was Koresh 's teacher ? Koresh did to his followers what Satan did to Eve . Did not Koresh kill his followersr ? Did not Satan cause Adam and Eve to die as well ? Did not the cult followers believe Koresh even though they knew the real Christ was born in Bethlehem ? Did not Eve choose to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil despite knowing that it would cause her death ? God held them all responsible -- deceiver and the rebeller . None of them had an excuse . As opposed to the Branch Davidians , we have a second chance . Follow Jesus and he will escort us to the path of eternal life . Do n't follow Jesus , and you stand condemned already , for like the Branch Davidian complex , your house is already on fire . Satan , Adam and Eve have already set it ablaze . It is just a slow burn , but it is burning nevertheless .

In the early 80 's with the fuel crisis , etc. , everyone wanted better fuel mileage . Diesel fuel was the cheapest fuel available and usually provides better mileage than comparable gasoline engines . So , GM decided to conver their 350 gas engine into a diesel engine ( I think was a 5.7 liter ) . Big mistake . The engine was not redesigned , but converted . The engine could not handle the higher compression , etc . Lots of problems with these cars . This thew up a big red flag to the casual observer -- DON '' T BUY A DIESEL . THEY ARE BAD . This was a gross generalization . Ask yourself this question -- if your livelihood depended on driving , LOTS of it , would you use a dependable or undependable ( but cheaper in the short run ) vehicle ? What do Greyhound busses have in them ? Trailer Trucks ? Even Train Locomotives ? Are these gasoline engines ? No , they are diesel . Tractor trailer truck manufacturers provide a 500,000 mile warrantee with they vehicles . I own an ` 82 Diesel Suburban . The 6.2L diesel is a GREAT engine . Just keeps going . It was more expensive ( when new ) than the gasoline engine vehicle was . The only problem with diesel engines is that when they need to be rebuilt , they are expensive . In a gas 350 engine , you will pay about $ 1000 for a rebuild . Diesel 6.2L is about $ 2000 . But then again , the diesel engine lasts about twice as long and gets about 50 % better mileage . A carburator for a gasoline engine costs about $ 100 to rebuild ( or less ) . A rebuild of the fuel injection pump on a diesel will cost about $ 500 ( or more ) . But then again , you never need a tune-up . If you 're looking at a rebuilt 6.2L , I 'd say you got a great deal . Check to see if the fuel injection pump was rebuilt also . Good luck .

A Christian should rely on his faith and intelligence . For instance , I have the faith that God will protect me but God also gave me the intelligence to know not to go walking down that dark alley at night .

The algorithm uses 32 rounds of scrambling compared with 16 in DES . In addition to the system key , each user will get to choose his or her own key and change it as often as desired . Call this key plain old K. When a message is to be sent it will first be K is the session key shared by the sender and receiver . Any method ( e.g. , public key ) can be used to establish the session key . In the AT & T telephone security devices , which will have the new chip , the key is negotiated using a public-key protocol . encrypted under K , then K will be encrypted under the unit key UK , and the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part message which will then be encrypted under the system key SK producing E { E [ M ; K ] , E [ K ; UK ] , serial number ; SK } My understanding is that E [ M ; K ] is not encrypted under SK ( called the '' family key '' ) and that the decrypt key corresponding to SK is held by law enforcement . Does anyone have first hand knowledge on this ? I will also check it out , but this is 7am Sunday so I did not want to wait . The unit key will be generated as the XOR of two 80-bit random numbers K1 and K2 ( UK=K1+K2 ) which will be kept by the two escrow The unit key , also called the `` chip key , '' is generated from the serial number N as follows . Let N1 , N2 , and N3 be 64 bit blocks derived from N , and let S1 and S2 be two 80-bit seeds used as keys . Compute the 64-bit block R1 = E [ D [ E [ N1 ; S1 ] ; S2 ] ; S1 ] ( Note that this is like using the DES in triple encryption mode with two keys . ) Similarly compute blocks R2 and R3 starting with N2 and N3 . ( I 'm unlear about whether the keys S1 and S2 change . The fact that they 're called seeds suggests they might . ) Then R1 , R2 , and R3 are concatenated together giving 192 bits . The first 80 bits form K1 and the next 80 bits form K2 . The remaining bits are discarded . authorities . Who these escrow authorities will be is still to be decided by the Attorney General , but it was stressed to me that they will NOT be NSA or law enforcement agencies , that they must be parties acceptable to the users of the system as unbiased . Marty is right on this and the FBI has asked me for suggestions . Please pass them to me along with your reasons . In addition to Marty's criteria , I would add that the agencies must have an established record of being able to safeguard highly sensitive information . Some suggestions I 've received so far include SRI , Rand , Mitre , the national labs ( Sandia , LANL , Los Alamos ) , Treasury , GAO . When a court order obtains K1 and K2 , and thence K , the law enforcement agency will use SK to decrypt all information flowing on the suspected link [ Aside : It is my guess that they may do this constantly on all links , with or without a court order , since it is almost impossible to tell which links over which a message will flow . ] My understanding is that there will be only one decode box and that it will be operated by the FBI . The service provider will isolate the communications stream and pass it to the FBI where it will pass through the decode box , which will have been keyed with K. for `` the wiretap authorizations . '' When Levy asked for the details so he could review the cases as required by law , the agent told him that his predecessors just turned over 40-50 blank , signed forms every time . Levi did not comply and changed the system , but the lesson is clear : No single person or authority should have the power to authorize wiretaps No single person does , at least for FBI taps . After completing a mound of paperwork , an agent must get the approval of several people on a chain that includes FBI legal counsel before the request is even taken to the Attorney General for final approval .

As many people have mentioned , there is no reason why insurers could not offer a contract without abortion services for a different premium . The problem is that there is no guarantee that this premium would be lower for those who chose this type of contract . Although you are removing one service , that may have feedbacks into other types of covered care which results in a net increase in actuarial costs . For an illustrative example in the opposite direction , it may be possible to ADD services to an insurance contract and REDUCE the premium . If you add preventative services and this reduces acute care use , then the total premium may fall .

As John Gilmore has pointed out repeatedly , if you produce the infrastructure that would permit a police state to function , all that is required to suddenly find yourself living in one is a change of attitude on the part of the government . Our constitution was built by men who had to risk their lives to ensure freedom in our country . They designed the system to make it difficult for tyranny to arise . For instance , one of the reasons the fourth amendment was put there was to make it harder for the government to try to make smuggling a crime . Think I jest ? John Hancock made all his money smuggling rum , which is , after all , a drug . Think about it . The government has everyones keys in escrow , and the FBI gets their pet `` wiretap without leaving the office '' scheme . There is a coup , which happens every day all around the world . Within hours , everyone in the country who might oppose the tyrants is being monitored more closely than ever before possible . Without the tools being in place , a tyranny can not stand . With tools like this in place , a tyrannical dictatorship could actually be successfully imposed . Why give the government tools with which to enslave you ? Maybe you can trust Bill Clinton , but are you willing to tell me that you can trust EVERY government that will ever arise in the U.S. hereafter ? I am not willing to make that leap of faith . > > -Tim May , whose sig block may get him busted in the New Regime > ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ > Is n't this just a little melodramatic ? I 'm a political dissident . As such , I am acutely aware of what happens to political dissidents in most of the world . In most of the world , I could be killed for my beliefs . Call Amnesty International some time to find out what happens to dissidents in most of the world . All that seperates the U.S. from most of those places is a thin piece of parchment in the National Archives thats being constantly more and more eroded by such farces as the war on drugs . Coups have happened in countries that have had stable democracies for over a hundred years . Governments throughout history have fallen . No government has lasted for more than a few hundred years . Often , they are replaced by dictatorships . Do you really believe so intensely that it could never ever ever happen here that you are willing to bet your own life and the lives of your children and other loved ones on it ? If we construct the tools with which tyranny could be enforced , we make it orders of magnitude more likely that it could happen , because if it happened with the tools already in place it could actually stick . Naive fools such as our leadership believe they can protect us where hundreds that have gone before have failed . Thriving democracies led by men far more skillfull than Bill Clinton have fallen to dictatorship . Rome had a thriving republic run by exquisitely skilled men before they became a tyranny . I , for one , am unwilling to trust that it could never happen here .

Gerald Perry of the Cardinals pinch hit in the eighth inning with two on and his club down by a run . He stroked a line drive into the right field corner . The ball cleared the three-foot high fence and went into the crowd . Darryl , racing over from right center , got to the spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence , but he missed the ball . A fan sitting in the front row , wearing a mitt , reached up and caught the ball . Home run . Now I 've seen the replay several times and I have concluded that Darryl missed the ball , and that the fan 's glove was essentially behind Darryl 's . Several Dodger fans with seats in the immediate vicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered with Strawberry . What can not be disputed , however , is that the fan who caught the ball never took his eye off it ; he was oblivious to where the fielder was playing . He was also quite exuberant as soon as he realized he had made the catch . That exuberance disappeared immediately , however , when Strawberry went into a tirade at the man . All reports indicate he used a lot of profanity and accused the man of interference , and therefore of costing the Dodgers a game . Shortly afterwards other fans hurled food and beverages toward the man who made the catch . Dodger Stadium officials started to remove him from the park , but then relented and just relocated him to another area . In an interview after the game , Lasorda blamed the fan for the loss . Strawberry also went into a tirade about how the fans are stupid and they do n't care about winning . L.A. Times columnists similarly blasted the man who made the catch . Before each Dodger game the public address announcer makes a speech wherein he says that fans are welcome to the souvenirs of balls that are hit into the stands as long as they do not interfere with any that are in the field of play . Was the fan wrong ? Should he have been more aware of the situation and acted to avoid any possibility of interference ? Or was he human and just reacting ? By the way , he is a season ticket holder and on his request the Dodgers have relocated his seats to another area of the Stadium where future interference is impossible . Others have questioned why Darryl should be so concerned with what the fan did when he has a grand total of 1 rbi through the first nine games . I question what he was doing in right center with a left-handed pull hitter up and the game on the line . Had he been closer to the play , he certainly would have had a much better chance of catching the ball . But I guess the big debate continues as to what are the responsibilities of the fan . -- The Beastmaster -- Mark Singer mss @ netcom.com

For a good display , you *must* get an active matrix panel and a *very* bright overhead projector designed to be used with an LCD panel ( i.e . stage must not get too hot ) . I tried out a Proxima Ovation unit and liked it , but I needed a brighter projector ( I used it with a 3M 920 ) . It is also too expensive for what you get , IMHO . Prices of active matrix panels are rumoured to drop substantially sometime this year ( something to do with tarrifs being lifted I think ) . In Canadian dollars , the Proxima Ovation models ranged in price from about $ 5000 to $ 7000 and a good overhead projector about $ 1000 to $ 1500 . For that kind of money , you can get a brighter image from a three beam projector , but sacrifice portability . Oh yes , proper room lighting is extremely important , especially if you want your audience to have enough light to read handouts and not have that light wash out your display at the front of the room . Tricky to get right .

Ref : Encyclopedia of Religion , Mircea Eliade MAGI : [ Sneak Preview : Later still , eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting ground for Iranian and Judeo-Christian religions , as can be seen in the famous _Oracles of Hystaspes_ , a work whose Iranian roots are undeniable and which most likely dates from the beginning of the Christian era , probably the second century CE ( Widengren , 1968 ) . The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of the Future ( Saoshyant ) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi to Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ ( 2:1-12 ) . ] The Old Persian word magu , rendered in Greek by magos , is of uncertain etymology . It may originally have meant `` member of the tribe , '' as in the Avestan compound mogu-tbish ( `` hostile to a member of the tribe '' ) . This meaning would have been further resticted , among the Medes , to `` member of the priestly tribe '' and perhaps to `` priest '' ( Benveniste , 1938 ; Boyce , 1982 ) . The term is probably of Median origin , given that Herodotus mentions the `` Magoi '' as one of the six tribes of the Medes . For a variety of reasons we can consider the Magi to have been members of a priestly tribe of Median origin in western Iran . Among the Persians , they were responsible for liturgical functions , as well as for maintaining their knowledge of the holy and the occult . Most likely , the supremacy of the Median priesthood in western Iran became established during the time of the Median monarchy that dominated the Persians from the end of the eighth century through the first half of the sixth century BCE until the revolt of Cyrus the Great ( 550 BCE ) . The Persians were indebted to the Medes for their political and civil institutions as well . Even if hypotheses have been advanced concerning the existence of Magi of Persian origin in the Achaemenid period ( Boyce , 1982 ) , we must still maintain that they were of Median origin . This is demonstrated by the eposide of the revolt of Gaumata the Magian , mentioned by Darius I ( 522-486 BCE ) in the inscription at Bisutun ( Iran ) , as well as by Greek sources . Indeed , Herodotus insists on the idea of the usurpatory power of the Medes against the Persians through the conspiracy of the Magi . The fact that the Magi may have been members of a tribe that handed down the sacerdotal arts in a hereditary fashion naturally did not exclude the possibility that some of them undertook secular prefessions . This seems to be attested by the Elamite tablets at Persepolis . There is a theses , put forth by Giuseppe Messina , that denies that the Magi are members of an ethnic group by suggesting that they are simply members of the priesthood - a priesthood of purely Zoroastrian origin . This thesis is untenable ; on the other hand , the hypothesis that their name is related to the Avestan term magavan , derived from the Gathic maga ( Vedic , magha , `` gift '' ) , is not without foundation ( Mole , 1963 ) . The meaning of maga can probably be found , in conformity with the Pahlavi tradition , within the context of the concept of purity , or separation of the `` mixture '' of the two opposed principles of spirit and matter . The maga , which has been erroneously interpreted as `` chorus , '' from the root mangh , which is said to mean `` sing the magic song '' ( Nyberg , 1966 ) and has been rendered simply by an expression like unio mystica , seems to be an ecstatic condition that opens the mind to spiritual vision . In any case , though there may be a relation between the Old Persian term magu and the Avestan terms magavan and maga , we must maintain a clear distinction between the Magi and the Avestan priesthood . The Avesta ignores the Median or Old Persian term , despite a recent hypothesis proposed by H.W . Bailey ; Old Persian inscriptions ignore the Avestan term for `` priest , '' athravan ( Vedic , athravan ) , even if this is perhaps present in an Achaeminid setting in the Elamite tablets of Persepolis ( Gershevitch , 1964 ) . The term magu has been present in Zoroastrianism throughout its history ; the Pahlavi terms mogh-mard and mobad represent its continuation . The latter in particular derives from an older form , magupati ( `` head of the Magi '' ) . During the Sasanid period ( third to seventh centuries CE ) , which saw the formation of a hierarchically organized church , the title mobadan mobad ( `` the high priest of high priests '' ) came to be used to designate the summit of the ecclesiastical hierarchy . The Magi practiced consanguineous marriage , or khvaetvadatha ( Av . ; Pahl. , khwedodah ) . They also performed a characteristic funeral rite : the exposure of the corpse to animals and vultures to remove the flesh and thereby cleanse it . The corpse was not supposed to decompose , lest it be contaminated by the demons of putrefaction . This practice later became typical of the entire Zoroastrian community and led to the rise of a complex funeral ritual in Iran and among the Parsis in India . Stone towers , known as dakhmas , were built especially for this rite . During the time of Herodotus the practice of exposure of the corpse was in vogue only among the Magi ; the Persians generally sprinkled the corpse with wax , then buried it . The practice was widespread , however , among the peoples of Central Asia . The Magi were the technicians of and experts on worship : it was impossible to offer sacrifices without the presence of a Magus . During the performance of a ritual sacrifice , the Magus sang of the theogony ( the Magi were possibly the custodians of a tradition of sacred poetry , but we know nothing about the relationship of this tradition to the various parts of the Avesta ) and was called upon to interpret dreams and to divine the future . The Magi were also known for the practice of killing harmful , or `` Ahrimanical , '' animals ( khrafstra ) such as snakes and ants . They dressed in the Median style , wearing pants , tunics , and coats with sleeves . They wore a characteristic head covering of felt ( Gr . tiara ) with strips on the sides that could be used to cover the nose and mouth during rituals to avoid contaminating consecrated objects with their breath ( Boyce , 1982 ) . The color of these caps , in conformity with a tradition that is probably of Indo-European origin , according to Georges Dumezil , was that of the priesthood : white . In all likelihood , during the Achaemenid period the Magi were not in possession of a well-defined body of doctrine , and it is probable that they gradually adopted Zoroastrianism ; they were most likely a clergy consisting of professional priests who were not tied to a rigid orthodoxy but were naturally inclined to eclecticism and syncretism . Nonetheless , they must have been jealous guardians of the patrimony of Zorastrian traditions . By virtue of this they were the educators of the royal princes . The wisest of them was responsible for teaching the prince the `` magic of Zarathushtra , son of Horomazes '' and thus the `` cult of the gods . '' Magi who excelled in other virtues were entrusted with the education of the prince so that he would learn to be just , courageous , and master of himself . During the Achaemenid period the Magi maintained a position of great influence , although they were certainly subordinate to the emperor . Despite several dramatic events such as the massacre they suffered after the death of Gaumata the Magian - in which , according to Herodotus ( who calls himself Smerdis ) , the Persians killed a large number of Magi to avenge the usurpation - the Magi nevertheless managed to maintain their influence at court in Media , in Persia , and in the various regions of the empire where they were stationed as a consequence of the Persian civilian and military administration . No priesthood of antiquity was more famous than that of the Magi . They were renowned as followers of Zarathushtra ( Zoroaster ) ; as the teachers of some of the greatest Greek thinkers ( Pythagoras , Democritus , Plato ) ; as the wise men who arrived , guided by a star , at the manger of the newborn savior in Bethlehem ; and as the propagators of a cult of the sun in India . But they were also known as the Chaldeans , the priesthood of Babylon , known for its occultism ; this was perhaps the reason that the term magos had a pejorative sense in Greek , like `` goes , '' `` expert in the magic arts '' ( Bidez and Cumont , 1938 ) . Indeed , the Chaldeans were experts in all types of magical arts , especially astrology , and had a reputation for wisdom as well as knowledge . To understand the reasons for such various and sometimes discordant views , it is necessary to distinguish between the Magi of Iran proper and the so-called western Magi , who were later hellenized . In the Achaemenid period both must have been at least in part Zoroastrian , but the western Magi ( those of the Iranian diaspora in Asia Minor , Syria , Mesopotamia , and Armenia ) , who came in contact with diverse religious traditions , must have , sooner or later and in varying degrees , been influenced by syncretic concepts . The Greeks were familiar with both kinds of Magi and , depending on their varying concerns , would emphasize one or the other aspect of them . Classical historians and geographers , including Herodotus and Strabo , document their customs , while the philosophers dwell above all on their doctrines : dualism , belief in the hereafter , Magian cosmology and cosmogony , and their theology and eschatology . Those sources most interested in the doctrines of the Magi even speak of Zarathushtra as a Magus . In doing so they are repeating what the Magi themselves said from the Median and Achaemenid periods , when they adopted Zoroastrianism . At that time they embraced Zarathushtra as one of their own and placed themselves under his venerable name . Zoroastrianism had already undergone several profound transformations in the eastern community by the time of the Acheamenids and was already adapting those elements of the archaic religion that refused to die . It has been said quite often , in an attempt to characterize the precise role of the Magi in the Zoroastrian tradition , that the Vendidad ( from vi-daevo-data , `` the law-abjuring daivas '' ) , part of the Avesta , should be attributed to them . ( This collection of texts from various periods is primarily concerned with purificatory rules and practices . ) Nonetheless , the hypothesis is hardly plausible , since the first chapter of the Vendidad - a list of sixteen lands created by Ahura Mazda , the supreme god of Zoroastrianism , but contaminated by an attack by Ahriman ( Pahl . ; Gathic-Avestan , Angra Mainyu ) , the other supreme god and the ultimate source of all evil and suffering - does not mention western Iran , Persia , or Media ( the land of Ragha mentioned in the text can not be Median Raghiana ) . Furthermore , it has been noted ( Gershevitch , 1964 ) that if the authors had been Magi the absence of any reference to western Iranian institutions , including their own priesthood , would be very strange . The Magi were above all the means by which the Zoroastrian tradition and the corpus of the Avesta have been transmitted to us , from the second half of the first millennium BCE on . This has been their principal merit . We can attribute directly to the Magi the new formulation that Iranian dualism assumed , known to us especially from Greek sources and , in part , from the Pahlavi literature of the ninth and tenth centuries CE . According to this formulation , the two poles of the dualism are no longer , as in the Gathas , Spenta Mainyu ( `` beneficent spirit '' ) and Angra Mainyu ( `` hostile spirit '' ) but Ahura Mazda himself and Angra Mainyu ( Gershevitch , 1964 ) . [ See Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu . ] This trans- formation was of immense consequence for the historical development of Zoro- astrianism and was most likely determined by the contact of the Magi with the Mesopotamian religious world . In this new dualism - which was that later known to the Greeks ( Aristotle , Eudemus of Rhodes , Theopompus , and others ) - we can see the affirmation of a new current of thought within Zoroastrianism , to which we give the name Zurvanism . [ See Zurvanism . ] Thanks to their adherence to Zoroastrianism , the Magi played an enormously important role in the transmission of Zarathushtra 's treachings , as well as in the definition of the new forms that these would assume historically . Their natural propensity to eclecticism and syncretism also helped the diffusion of Zoroastrian ideas in the communities of the Iranian diaspora . The Greeks began to study their doctrines and to take an interest in them ( Xanthus of Lydia , Hermodorus , Aristotle , Theopompus , Hermippus , Dinon ) , even writing treatises on the Persian religion , of which only the titles and a few fragments have survived . In the Hellenistic period , the Magi were seen as a secular school of wisdom , and writings on magic , astrology , and alchemy were lent the authority of such prestigious names as Zarathushtra , Ostanes , and Hystaspes , forming an abundant apocryphal literature . ( Bidez and Cumont , 1938 ) . Later still , eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting ground for Iranian and Judeo-Christian religions , as can be seen in the famous _Oracles of Hystaspes_ , a work whose Iranian roots are undeniable and which most likely dates from the beginning of the Christian era , probably the second century CE ( Widengren , 1968 ) . The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of the Future ( Saoshyant ) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi to Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ ( 2:1-12 ) . [ See Saoshyant . ] The Sasanid period saw the Magi once again play a determining role in the religious history of Iran . Concerned to win back the western Magi ( de Menasce , 1956 ) , and eager to consolidate Zoroastrianism as the national religion of Iran , the priests of Iranian sanctuaries in Media and Persia were able to establish a true state church , strongly hierarchical and endowed with an orthodoxy based on the formation of a canon of scriptures . The leading figures in the development of a state religion and of Zoroastrian orthodoxy were Tosar and Kerder , the persecutors of Mani in the third century . SAOSHYANT : The Avestan term saoshyant ( `` future benefactor '' ; MPers. , soshans ) designates the savior of the world , who will arrive at a future time to redeem humankind . The concept of the future savior is one of the fundamental notions of Zoro- astrianism , together with that of dualism ; it appears as early as in the Gathas . Zarathushtra ( Zoroaster ) , as the prophet of the religion , is himself a Sao- shyant , one who performs his works for the Frashokereti , the end of the present state of the world , when existence will be `` rehabilitated '' and `` made splendid . '' [ See Frashokereti ] Later Zoroastrian doctrine developed this notion into a true eschatological myth and expanded the number of Saoshyants from one to three . All the saviors are born from the seed of Zarathushtra , which is preserved through the ages in Lake Kansaoya ( identified with present-day Lake Helmand , in Seistan , Iran ) , protected by 99,999 fravashis , or guardian spirits . The greatest of the awaited Saoshyants , the victorious Astvatereta ( `` he who embodies truth '' ) , the son of the Vispataurvairi ( `` she who conquers all '' ) , is the third , who will make existence splendid ; he appears in Yashts 19 . Upon his arrival humankind will no longer be subject to old age , death , or corruption , and will be granted unlimited power . At that time the dead will be resurrected , and the living will be immortal and indestructable . Brandishing the weapon with which he kills the powerful enemies of the world of truth ( that is , the world of the spirit , and of asha ) , Astvatereta will look upon the whole of corporeal existence and render it imperishable . He and his comrades will engage in a great battle with the forces of evil , which will be destroyed . The name Astvatereta is clearly the result of theological speculation ( Kellens , 1974 ) , as are those of his two brothers , Ukhshyatereta , `` he who makes truth grow , '' and Ukhshyatnemah , `` he who makes reverence grow '' ; the names of the three virgins ( Yashts 13 ) who are impregnated with the seed of Zarathushtra when they bathe in Lake Kansaoya and give birth to the Saoshyants , are equally speculative . Each of these Saoshyants will arrive at the beginning of a millennium , initiating a new age and a new cycle of existence ; Astvatereta will appear in the third and final millennium to save mankind . The doctrine of the future savior had already taken shape in the Archaemenid period ( sixth to fourth century BCE ) . It was not , perhaps the principal element in the formation of the messianic idea , but it was certainly a determining factor , one that enjoyed great success in the Hellenistic period beyond the confines of the Iranian world . A similar concept , that of the future Buddha , Maitreya , was most likely indebted to it , and Christian messianism can trace its roots to the same source .

How would this number compare if I bought the state-of-the-art SCSI card for my ISA PC , and the state-of-the-art SCSI hard drive ( the wailing-est system I could hope for ) ? Obviously money factors into this choice as well as any other , but what would YOU want to use on your ISA system ? And how much would it cost ? Along those lines , what kind of transfer rate could I see with my IDE HD 's if I were to buy the top-of-the-line IDE caching controller for my 200Mb , 15ms HD ? And how much would it cost ? I actually have a PAS-16 , and could ( what a waste I guess it would be ... ) hook up a SCSI HD through it 's SCSI port which yields an optimum of 690Kb/sec . Actually , I have a borrowed 12ms Fujitsu HD hooked up through it now ( and own the Trantor HD drivers for the PAS-16 SCSI port ) . Is this SCSI port a SCSI-2 port ? How could I tell ? Is the Fujitsu 2623A a SCSI-2 ? Are all SCSI HD 's SCSI-2 ? Thanks for any comments . Randy

Once one has accepted the _assumption_ that there is no god ( s ) , and then consider other faiths to be irrational simply because their assumption ( s ) contradict your assumption , then I would say there 's a lack of consistency here . Now I know you 'll get on me about faith . If the _positive_ belief that God does not exist were a closed , logical argument , why do so many rational people have problems with that `` logic '' ? But you , probably like me , seem to be a soft atheist . Sorry for the flamage . > The line about atheists haveing something up their sleeves is what seemed > to imply that .

It might have appeared to attack atheism in general , but its point was that mass killing happens for all sorts of reasons . People will hate who they will and will wave whatever flag to justify it , be it cross or hammer & sickle . The Stalin example _is_ important not only because it's still a widely unappreciated era that people want to forget but also because people really did love him and his ideas , even after all that he had wrought . > The evidence I am referring to is more a lack of evidence than negative > evidence .

First , all the pink crows/unicorns/elves arguments in the world will not sway most people , for they simply do not accept the analogy . Why ? One of the big reasons is that many , many people want something beyond this life . You can pretend that they do n't want this , but I for one can accept it and even want it myself sometimes . And there is nothing unique in this example of why people want a God . Can love as a truth be proven , logically ? > > themselves , namely , a god or gods .

I find it hard to see how that behavior is arrogant at all . Many Christians I know also boast in this way , but I still do not necessarily see it as arrogance . Of course , I do know arrogant Christians , doctors , and teachers as well . Technically , you might consider the person who originally made a given claim to be arrogant , Jesus , for instance . > Are you talking about all atheism or just strong atheism ?

While most work in hospitals and clinics , many major cities will have RD 's who are in `` private practice '' so to speak . Many physicans will refer their patients with Crohn 's disease to RD 's for dietary help . If you can get your friend 's physician to make a referral , medical insurance should pay for the RD 's services just like the services of a physical therapist . The better medical insurance plans will cover this but even if your friend 's plan does n't , it would be well worth the cost to get on a good diet to control the intestinal discomfort and help the intestinal lining heal . Crohn 's disease is an inflammatory disease of the intestinal lining and lipoxygenase inhibitors may help by decreasing leukotriene formation but I 'm not aware of tea or turmeric containing lipoxygenase inhibitors . For bad inflammation , steroids are used but for a mild case , the side effects are not worth the small benefit gained by steroid use . Upjohn is developing a new lipoxygenase inhibitor that should greatly help deal with inflammatory diseases but it 's not available yet . Marty B .

Ah , now here is the core question . Let me suggest a scenario . We will grant that a God exists , and uses revelation to communicate with humans . ( Said revelation taking the form ( paraphrased from your own words ) 'This infinitely powerful deity grabs some poor schmuck , makes him take dictation , and then hides away for a few hundred years ' . ) Now , there exists a human who has not personally experienced a revelation . This person observes that not only do these revelations seem to contain elements that contradict rather strongly aspects of the observed world ( which is all this person has ever seen ) , but there are many mutually contradictory claims of revelation . Now , based on this , can this person be blamed for concluding , absent a personal revelation of their own , that there is almost certainly nothing to this 'revelation ' thing ? > I 'm not an objectivist , so I 'm not particularly impressed with problems of > conceptualization .

Absent this better language , and absent observations in support of the claims of revelation , can one be blamed for doubting the whole thing ? Here is what I am driving at : I have thought a long time about this . I have come to the honest conclusion that if there is a deity , it is nothing like the ones proposed by any religion that I am familiar with . Now , if there does happen to be , say , a Christian God , will I be held accountable for such an honest mistake ? Sincerely , Ray Ingles ingles @ engin.umich.edu `` The meek can *have* the Earth .

Organization : /etc/organization Lines : 26 We have a setup with with 13 polaroid transducers and rangefinders . We would like to fire these three at a time with about 5 ms between firings . The three that are being fired do not fire in the same direction . To further explain the situation , assume we are firing sonars A , B , C 5 ms apart each other . We should normally see an echo on A that corresponds to the distance . However , sonar A detects the INIT line of sonar B ! The detection is actually through the transducer of sonar A ; we can see a very faint 50Khz signal on the transducer , exactly at the time the init line of sonar B is activated . We feel that there is some ground coupling that is causing this interference . We came to this conclusion since we are using a separate power supply for sonars B and C.

From : wjhovi01 @ ulkyvx.louisville.edu Subject : Re : Why do people become atheists ? Organization : University of Louisville Lines : 13 Undoubtedly people adopt atheism for many reasons , but I suspect that a biggie is that the God they 've believed in is ( in J.B. Phillips 's words ) `` too small '' . If a person 's understanding of God is not allowed to grow and develop , it will eventually become inadequate . The grey-haired gentleman on a throne who was a comforting image in childhood becomes a joke . A therapist friend of mine sometimes suggests to her clients that they `` fire God '' . What she means by that is letting go of an inadequate understanding of God to make room for a fuller one . But she follows up by encouraging them to '' hire a new one '' . My guess is that a lot of folks go through the firing process , but are not adequately supported in the subsequent re-hire . billh

We live right by the CA border and he has gotten drugs for GERD prescribed by a US physician and filled in a CA pharmacy , but not yet FDA approved in the US . What would be the cost of the oral form in CA $ also if anyone would have that info ? Thanks

Yes , it 's a shame that the NHL lost a fine team in one of the best hockey markets in the country . Being a North Stars fan , it is sad to see all of the tradition of the last 26 years get thrown into oblivion at the hands of a truly crappy owner . Hopefully the NHL will install an expansion franchise in the Twin Cities within the next five years . Even if this is the case , a lot has been lost in the North Stars move ... KEA

If the most Frequently Asked Question in rec.motorcycles is `` What is the DoD ? `` , then the second most Frequently Asked Question must be `` How do I get a DoD number ? '' That is as simple as asking the Keeper of the List ( KotL , accept no substitue Keepers ) for a number . If you 're feeling creative , and your favorite number has n't been taken already , you can make a request , subject to KotL approval . ( Warning , non-numeric , non- base-10 number requests are likely to earn a flame from the KotL . Not that you wo n't get it , but you _will_ pay for it . ) Oh , and just one little , tiny suggestion . Ask the KotL in e-mail . You'll just be playing the lightning rod for flames if you post to the whole net , and you 'll look like a clueless newbie too . By now you 're probably asking `` So who 's the KotL already ? '' . Well , as John Sloan notes below , that 's about the only real `` secret '' left around here , but a few ( un ) subtle hints can be divulged . First , it is not myself , nor anyone mentioned by name in this posting ( maybe : - ) , though John was the original KotL . Second , in keeping with the true spirit of Unix , the KotL 's first name is only two letters long , and can be spelled entirely with hexadecimal characters . ( 2.5 , the KotL shares his name with a line- oriented text utility . ) Third , he has occasionally been seen posting messages bestowing new DoD numbers ( mostly to boneheads with `` weenie mailers '' ) . Fourth , there is reason to suspect the KotL of being a Dead-Head . ***************** Newsflash : A message from the KotL ****************** Once you have surmounted this intellectual pinnacle and electronically groveled to the KotL , please keep in mind that the KotL does indeed work for a living , and occasionally must pacify its boss by getting something done . Your request may languish in mailer queue for ( gasp ! ) days , perhaps even ( horrors ! ) a week or two . During such times of economic activity on the part of the KotL 's employers , sending yet another copy of your request will not speed processing of the queue ( it just makes it longer , verification of this phenominon is left as an excersize for the reader ) . If you suspect mailer problems , at least annotate subsequent requests with an indication that a former request was submitted , lest you be assigned multiple numbers ( what , you think the KotL *memorizes* the list ? ! ? ) . *********************************************************************** One more thing , the KotL says that its telepathic powers are n't what they used to be . So provide some information for the list , will ya ? The typical DoD List entry contains number , name , state/country , & e-mail address . For example : 0111 : Ed Green : CA : ed.green @ East.Sun.COM ( PS : While John mentions below that net access and a bike are the only requirements for DoD membership , that 's not strictly true these days , as there are a number of Denizens who lack one or both . ) Blaine ( Dances With Bikers ) Gardner blgardne @ javelin.sim.es.com -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- `` Denizens of Doom '' , by Bruce Tanner ( DoD 0161 ) [ Road Rider , August 1991 , reprinted with Bruce 's permission ] There is a group of motorcyclists that gets together and does all the normal things that a bunch of bikers do . They discuss motorcycles and motorcycling , beverages , cleaning fluids , baklavah , balaclava , caltrops , helmets , anti-fog shields , spine protectors , aerodynamics , three-angle valve seats , bird hits , deer whistles , good restaurants , racing philosophy , traffic laws , tickets , corrosion control , personalities , puns , double entendres , culture , absence of culture , first rides and friendship . They argue with each other and plan rides together . The difference between this group and your local motorcycle club is that , although they get together just about everyday , most have never seen each other face to face . The members of this group live all over the known world and communicate with each other electronically via computer . The computers range from laptops to multi-million dollar computer centers ; the people range from college and university students to high-tech industry professionals to public-access electronic bulletin-board users . Currently , rec.motorcycles ( pronounced `` wreck-dot-motorcycles , '' it 's the file name for the group 's primary on-line `` meeting place '' ) carries about 2250 articles per month ; it is read by an estimated 29,000 people . Most of the frequent posters belong to a motorcycle club , the Denizens of Doom , usually referred to as the DoD . The DoD started when motorcyclist John R. Nickerson wrote a couple of parodies designed to poke fun at motorcycle stereotypes . Fellow computer enthusiast Bruce Robinson posted these articles under the pen name , `` Denizen of Doom . '' A while later Chuck Rogers signed off as DoD nr . 0003 Keeper of the Flame . Bruce was then designated DoD nr . 0002 , retroactively and , of course , Nickerson , the originator of the parodies , was given DoD nr . 0001 . The idea of a motorcycle club with no organization , no meetings and no rules appealed to many , so John Sloan -- DoD nr . 0011 -- became Keeper of the List , issuing DoD numbers to anyone who wanted one . To date there have been almost 400 memberships issued to people all over the United States and Canada , as well as Australia , New Zealand , the United Kingdom , France , Germany , Norway and Finland . Keeper of the List Sloan eventually designed a club patch . The initial run of 300 patches sold out immediately . The profits from this went to the American Motorcycle Heritage Foundation . Another AMHF fund raiser -- selling Denizens of Doom pins to members -- was started by Arnie Skurow a few months later . Again , the project was successful and the profits were donated to the foundation . So far , the Denizens have contributed over $ 1500 to the AMA museum . A plaque in the name of the Denizens of Doom now hangs in the Motorcycle Heritage Museum . As often as possible , the DoD'ers crawl out from behind their CRTs and go riding together . It turns out that the two largest concentrations of DoD'ers are centered near Denver/Boulder , Colorado , and in California 's '' Silicon Valley . '' Consequently , two major events are the annual Assault on Rollins Pass in Colorado , and the Northern versus Southern California '' Joust . '' The Ride-and-Feed is a bike trip over Rollins Pass , followed by a big barbecue dinner . The concept for the Joust is to have riders from Northern California ride south ; riders from Southern California to ride north , meeting at a predesignated site somewhere in the middle . An additional plan for 1991 is to hold an official Denizens of Doom homecoming in conjunction with the AMA heritage homecoming in Columbus , Ohio , in July . Though it 's a safe bet the the Denizens of Doom and their collective communications hub , rec.motorcycles , will not replace the more traditional motorcycle organizations , for those who prowl the electronic pathways in search of two-wheeled camaraderie , it 's a great way for kindred spirits to get together . Long may they flame . `` Live to Flame -- Flame to Live '' [ centerbar ] This official motto of the Denizens of Doom refers to the ease with which you can gratuitously insult someone electronically , when you would not do anything like that face to face . These insults are known as `` flames '' ; issuing them is called `` flaming . '' Flames often start when a member disagrees with something another member has posted over the network . A typical , sophisticated , intelligent form of calm , reasoned rebuttal would be something like : `` What an incredibly stupid statement , you Spandex-clad poseur ! '' This will guarantee that five other people will reply in defense of the original poster , describing just what they think of you , your riding ability and your cat . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- _The Denizens of Doom : The Saga Unfolds_ by John Sloan DoD # 0011 Periodically the question `` What is DoD ? '' is raised . This is one of those questions in the same class as `` Why is the sky blue ? `` , `` If there is a God , why is there so much suffering in the world ? '' and `` Why do women inevitably tell you that you 're such a nice guy just before they dump you ? `` , the kinds of questions steeped in mysticism , tradition , and philosophy , questions that have inspired research and discussion by philosophers in locker rooms , motorcycle service bays , and in the halls of academe for generations . A long , long time ago ( in computer time , where anything over a few minutes is an eternity and the halting problem really is a problem ) on a computer far , far away on the net ( topologically speaking ; two machines in the same room in Atlanta might route mail to one another via a system in Chicago ) , a chap who wished to remain anonymous ( but who was eventually assigned the DoD membership # 1 ) wrote a satire of the various personalities and flame wars of rec.motorcycles , and signed it `` The Denizen of Doom '' . Not wishing to identify himself , he asked that stalwart individual who would in the fullness of time become DoD # 2 to post it for him . DoD # 2 , not really giving a whit about what other people thought and generally being a right thinking individual , did so . Flaming and other amusements followed . He who would become the holder of DoD membership # 3 thought this was the funniest thing he 'd seen in a while ( being the sort that is pretty easily amused ) , so he claimed membership in the Denizens of Doom Motorcycle Club , and started signing his postings with his membership number . Perhaps readers of rec.motorcycles were struck with the vision of a motorcycle club with no dues , no rules , no restrictions as to brand or make or model or national origin of motorcycle , a club organized electronically . It may well be that readers were yearning to become a part of something that would provide them with a greater identity , a gestalt personality , something in which the whole was greater than the sum of its parts . It could also be that we 're all computer nerds who wear black socks and sneakers and pocket protectors , who just happen to also love taking risks on machines with awesome power to weight ratios , social outcasts who saw a clique that would finally be open minded enough to accept us as members . In a clear case of self fulfilling prophesy , The Denizens of Doom Motorcycle Club was born . A club in which the majority of members have never met one another face to face ( and perhaps like it that way ) , yet feel that they know one another pretty well ( or well enough given some of the electronic personalities in the newsgroup ) . A club organized and run ( in the loosest sense of the word ) by volunteers through the network via electronic news and mail , with a membership/mailing list ( often used to organize group rides amongst members who live in the same region ) , a motto , a logo , a series of photo albums circulating around the country ( organized by DoD # 9 ) , club patches ( organized by # 11 ) , and even an MTV-style music video ( produced by # 47 and distributed on VHS by # 18 ) ! Where will it end ? Who knows ? Will the DoD start sanctioning races , placing limits on the memory and clock rate of the on-board engine management computers ? Will the DoD organize poker runs where each participant collects a hand of hardware and software reference cards ? Will the DoD have a rally in which the attendees demand a terminal room and at least a 386-sized UNIX system ? Only time will tell . The DoD has no dues , no rules , and no requirements other than net access and a love for motorcycles . To become a member , one need only ask ( although we will admit that who you must ask is one of the few really good club secrets ) . New members will receive via email a membership number and the latest copy of the membership list , which includes name , state , and email address . The Denizens of Doom Motorcycle Club will live forever ( or at least until next year when we may decided to change the name ) .

The Names have been changes to protect the Guilty ( riders ) and Innocent ( the bikes ) alike . If you think you recognize a contorted version of your name , you do n't . It 's just your guilt complex working against you . Read 'em and weep . We tune in on a conversation between some of our heros . Terrible Barbarian is extolling the virtues of his Hopalonga Puff-a-cane to Reverend Muck Mudgers and Stompin Fueling-Injection : Terrible : This Hopalonga is the greatest ... Beats BMWs dead ! ! Muck : I do n't mean to preach , Terrible , but lighten up on the BMW crowd eh ? I mean like I like riding my Yuka-yuka Fudgeo-Jammer 11 but what the heck . Stompin : No way , the BMW is it , complete , that 's all man . Terrible : Nahhhh , you 're sounding like Heritick Ratatnack ! Hey , at least he is selling his BMW and uses a Hopalonga Intercorruptor ! Not as good as a Puff-a-cane , should have been called a Woosh-a-stream . Stompin : You mean Wee-Stream . Terrible : Waddya going to do ? Call in reinforcements ? ? ? Stompin : Yehh man . Here comes Arlow Scarecrow and High Tech . Let 's see what they say , eh ? Muck : Now men , let 's try to be civil about this . High Tech : Hi , I 'm a 9 and the BMW is the greatest . Arlow : Other than my B.T . I love my BMW ! Terrible : B.T. ? ? ? Arlow : Burley Thumpison , the greatest all American ride you can own . Muck : Ahhh , look , you 're making Terrible gag . Terrible : What does BMW stand for anyway ? ? ? Muck , Arlow , High : Beats Me , Wilhelm . Terrible : Actually , my name is Terrible . Hmmm , I do n't know either . Muck : Say , here comes Chunky Bear . Chunky : Hey , Hey , Hey ! Smarter than your average bear ! Terrible : Hey , did n't you drop your BMW ? ? ? Chunky : All right eh , a little BooBoo , but I left him behind . I mean even Villy Ogle flamed me for that ! Muck : It 's okay , we all makes mistakes . Out of the blue the West coasters arrive , led by Tread Orange with Dill Snorkssy , Heritick Ratatnack , Buck Garnish , Snob Rasseller and the perenial favorite : Hooter Boobin Brush ! Heritick : Heya Terrible , how 's yer front to back bias ? Terrible : Not bad , sold yer BMW ? Heritick : Nahhh . Hooter : Hoot , Hoot . Buck : Nice tree Hooter , how 'd ya get up there ? Hooter : Carbujectors from Hell ! ! ! Muck : What 's a carbujector ? Hooter : Well , it ai n't made of alumican ! ! ! Made by Tilloslert ! ! Muck : Ahh , come on down , we are n't going to flame ya , honest ! ! Dill : Well , where do we race ? Snob : You know , Chunky , we know about about your drop and well , don't ride ! Muck : No ! No ! Quiet ! Tread : BMW 's are the greatest in my supreme level headed opinion . They even have luggage made by Sourkraut ! High : My 9 too ! Terrible , Heritick , Dill , Buck : Nahhhhh ! ! ! Stompin , Tread , High , Chunky , Snob : Yesss Yessssss ! ! ! Before this issue could be resolved the Hopalonga crew called up more cohorts from the local area including Polyanna Stirrup and the infamous Booster Robiksen on his Cavortin ! Polyanna : Well , men , the real bikers use stirrups on their bikes like I use on my Hopalonga Evening-Bird Special . Helpful for getting it up on the ole ventral stand ! Terrible : Hopalonga 's are great like Polyanna says and Yuka-Yuka 's and Sumarikis and Kersnapis are good too ! Booster : I hate Cavortin . All : WE KNOW , WE KNOW . Booster : I love Cavortin . All : WE KNOW WE KNOW . Muck : Well , what about Mucho Guzlers and Lepurras ? Snob , Tread : Nawwwwww . Muck : What about a Tridump ? Terrible : Is n't that a chewing gum ? Muck : Auggggg , Waddda about a Pluck-a-kity ? Heritick : Heyya Muck , you tryin ' to call up the demon rider himself ? Muck : No , no . There is more to Mudder-Disciples than arguing about make . Two more riders zoom in , in the form of Pill Turret and Phalanx Lifter . Pill : Out with dorsal stands and ventral stands forever . Phalanx : Hey , I do n't know about that . And Now even more west coasters pour in . Road O'Noblin : Hopalonga 's are the greatest ! Maulled Beerstein : May you sit on a bikejector ! Suddenly more people arrived from the great dark nurth : Kite Lanolin : Hey , BMW 's are great , men . Robo-Nickie : I prefer motorcycle to robot transformers , personally . More riders from the west coast come into the discussion : Aviator Sourgas : Get a Burley-Thumpison with a belted-rigged frame . Guess Gasket : Go with a BMW or Burley-Thumpison . With a roar and a screech the latest mudder-disciple thundered in . It was none other that Clean Bikata on her Hopalonga CaBammerXorn . Clean : Like look , Hopalonga are it but only CaBammerXorns . Muck : Why ? ? Clean : Well , like it 's got ta be a 6-banger or nothin . Muck : But I only have a 4-banger . Clean : No GOOD ! Chunky : Sob , some of us only have 2-bangers ! Clean : Inferior ! Stompin : Hey , look , here 's proof BMW 's are better . The Bimmer-Boys burst into song : ( singing ) Beemer Babe , Beemer Babe give me a thrill ... Road , Terrible , Polyanna , Maulled , Dill etc . : Wadddoes BMW stand for ? Heritick , Stompin , Snob , Chunky , Tread , Kite , High , Arlow : BEAT 'S ME , WILHEM ! Road , Terrible , Polyanna , Maulled , Dill etc . : Oh , do n't you mean BMW ? And so the ensuing argument goes until the skies clouded over and the thunder roared and the Greatest Mudder-Disciple ( G.M.D . ) of them all boomed out . G.M.D . : Enough of your bickering ! You are doomed to riding Bigot & Suction powered mini-trikes for your childish actions . All : no , No , NO ! ! ! Puhlease . Does this mean that all of the wreck.mudder-disciples will be riding mini-trikes ? Are our arguing heros doomed ?

Quist DoD # 94 [ Scene : A sterile engineering office . A lone figure , whom we 'll call Chuck , stands by a printer output bin , wearing a white CDC lab coat , with 5 mechanical pencils in a pocket protector . ] ( editor 's note : For some reason a great deal of amusement was had at the First Annual DoD Uni-Coastal Ironhorse Ride & Joust by denizens referring to each other as `` Chuck '' . I guess you had to be there . I was n't . ) Chuck : I did n't want to be a Software Systems Analyst , cow-towing to the whims of a machine , and saying yessir , nosir , may-I-have-another-sir . My mother made me do it . I wanted to live a man 's life , [ Music slowly builds in background ] riding Nortons and Triumphs through the highest mountain passes and the deepest valleys , living the life of a Motorcyclist ; doing donuts and evading the police ; terrorizing old ladies and raping small children ; eating small dogs for tea ( and large dogs for dinner ) .

Scene simultaneously changes to the top of an obviously assaulted Rollins Pass .

Well , the first thing you have to understand ( just in case you managed to read this far , and still not figure it out ) is that the DoD started as a joke . And in the words of one Denizen , it intends to remain one . Sometime in the far distant past , a hapless newbie asked : `` What does DoD stand for ? It 's not the Department of Defense is it ? '' Naturally , a Denizen who had watched the movie `` Top Gun '' a few times too many rose to the occasion and replied : '' That 's classified , we could tell you , but then we 'd have to kill you . '' And the rest is history . A variation on the `` security '' theme is to supply disinformation about what DoD stands for . Notable contributions ( and contributers , where known ) include : Daughters of Democracy ( DoD 23 ) Doers of Donuts Dancers of Despair ( DoD 9 ) Debasers of Daughters Dickweeds of Denver Driveway of Death Debauchers of Donuts Dumpers of Dirtbikes Note that this is not a comprehensive list , as variations appear to be limited only by the contents of one 's imagination or dictionary file . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- The rec.moto.photo archive First a bit of history , this all started with Ilana Stern and Chuck Rogers organizing a rec.motorcycles photo album . Many copies were made , and several sets were sent on tours around the world , only to vanish in unknown locations . Then Bruce Tanner decided that it would be appropriate for an electronic medium to have an electronic photo album . Bruce has not only provided the disk space and ftp & e-mail access , but he has taken the time to scan most of the photos that are available from the archive . Not only can you see what all these folks look like , you can also gawk at their motorcycles . A few non-photo files are available from the server too , they include the DoD membership list , the DoD Yellow Pages , the general rec.motorcycles FAQ , and this FAQ posting . Here are a couple of excerpts from from messages Bruce posted about how to use the archive . ********************************************************** Via ftp : cerritos.edu [ 130.150.200.21 ] Via e-mail : The address is server @ cerritos.edu . The commands are given in the body of the message . The current commands are DIR and SEND , given one per line . The arguments to the commands are VMS style file specifications . For rec.moto.photo the file spec is [ DOD ] file . For example , you can send : dir [ dod ] send [ dod ] bruce_tanner.gif send [ dod ] dodframe.ps and you 'll get back 5 mail messages ; a directory listing , 3 uuencoded parts of bruce_tanner.gif , and the dodframe.ps file in ASCII . Oh , wildcards ( * ) are allowed , but a maximum of 20 mail messages ( rounded up to the next whole file ) are send . A 'send [ dod ] *.gif ' would send 150 files of 50K each ; not a good idea . -- Bruce Tanner ( 213 ) 860-2451 x 596 Tanner @ Cerritos.EDU Cerritos College Norwalk , CA cerritos ! tanner ********************************************************** A couple of comments : Bruce has put quite a bit of effort into this , so why not drop him a note if you find the rec.moto.photo archive useful ? Second , since Bruce has provided the server as a favor , it would be kind of you to access it after normal working hours ( California time ) . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Patches ? What patches ? You may have heard mention of various DoD trinkets such as patches & pins . And your reaction was probably : `` I want ! `` , or `` That 's sick ! `` , or perhaps `` That 's sick ! I want ! '' Well , there 's some good news and some bad news . The good news is that there 's been an amazing variety of DoD-labeled widgets created . The bad news is that there is n't anywhere you can buy any of them . This isn't because of any `` exclusivity '' attempt , but simply because there is no '' DoD store '' that keeps a stock . All of the creations have been done by individual Denizens out of their own pockets . The typical procedure is someone says `` I 'm thinking of having a DoD frammitz made , they 'll cost $ xx.xx , with $ xx.xx going to the AMA museum . Anyone want one ? '' Then orders are taken , and a batch of frammitzes large enough to cover the pre-paid orders is produced ( and quickly consumed ) . So if you want a DoD doodad , act quickly the next time somebody decides to do one . Or produce one yourself if you see a void that needs filling , after all this is anarchy in action . Here 's a possibly incomplete list of known DoD merchandise ( and perpetrators ) .

The East Coast Denizens got together for the Right Coast Ride ( RCR ) , with bikers from as far north as NH , and as far south as FL meeting in the Blueridge Mountains of North Carolina . The Pacific Northwest crew organized the first Great Pacific Northwest Dryside Gather ( GPNDG ) , another successful excuse for riding motorcycles , and seeing the faces behind the names we all have come to know so well . [ Thanks to Ed Green for the above addition . ] Also worth mentioning are : The first rec.moto.dirt ride , held in the Moab/Canyonlands area of southern Utah . Riders from 5 states showed up , riding everything from monster BMWs to itty-bitty XRs to almost-legal 2-strokes . And though it 's not an `` official '' ( as if anything could be official with this crowd ) rec.moto event , the vintage motorcycle races in Steamboat Springs , Colorado always provides a good excuse for netters to gather . There 's also been the occasional Labor Day gather in Utah . European Denizens have staged some gathers too .

I need it to accept LINE inputs ( tape deck , CD player , etc . ) and output to the same ! So input impedance should equal output impedance . Also , since I am driving a line , I would need 1 volt p-p output . Final requirement is that I can either : 1 . Control it digitally OR 2 . Control it easily , or with few resistors FINALLY - If anyone knows of any FILTER or EQUALIZER chips , that might be useful , please let me know .

Actually , they wo n't . What they 'll tell you is that if you add up the number of suicides , murders of one drug dealer by another , legit self-defenses of a battered spouse , and so on , you 'll end up with a number that is much larger than the number of self-defense killings against strangers committed in the bedroom .

There are two issues here : copyright and patent . The magazine article 's contents are copyrighted , and may not be reproduced , translated , etc. , without the copyright holder 's permission . However , this does not cover the *ideas* expressed , only the form of expression . Copying their circuit diagram or PC-board pattern is copyright infringement . But it 's unlikely that they could stretch copyright far enough to claim that the circuit design itself is copyrighted . So long as you draw your own diagrams and lay out your own boards , copyright should n't be an issue . Patents are different . The author does *not* have to give you any warning that the design is covered by patent ( although it would be sensible for him to do so ) . In fact , it 's possible that *he* was infringing on someone else 's patent without realizing it . Ignorance of the patented status is not a defence against infringement , although it might reduce the damages a court would award . However ... unless there was something seriously novel about the circuit , almost certainly it is `` obvious to one skilled in the art '' and therefore unpatentable . Routine engineering is not patentable ; patents ( in theory ) cover only inventions , ideas that are genuinely new . Caution : I am not a lawyer .

[ It will encourage the *FBI* to commit ( even more ) criminal acts , but that 's not the point here . ] But this gives another avenue of attack on the Clipper proposal . When the EFF/ACLU/CPSR FOIA requests are made , they should ask for details on the bureaucratic and equipment infrastructure that is proposed ( or even already budgeted ) for the FBI to service tapping requests -- for now and the projected future . From these figures , estimate the number of Clipper-tap requests the FBI is expecting . Publish this figure . Compare it on a per-capita basis with the amount of tapping now known or suspected . Also estimate how expensive it would be for the FBI to install more Clipper-tapping stations , and how rapidly they could be built and installed ... ie , get the `` plus or minus '' epsilon for the near future . Might be a mite disturbing for J. Q . Public to know these things . And despite all the technical details [ BTW , thanks to those who 've been providing them ! ] , we still do n't know 1 ) how the tapping requests will be transmitted and authenticated ( though it is n't too hard to guess a good scheme ) . 2 ) how the results will be securely transmitted ( Fed Ex the audio tapes ? ) 3 ) how privacy will be re-established when an investigation is complete . +========================================================================+ | dwight tuinstra best : tuinstra @ sandman.ece.clarkson.edu | | tolerable : tuinstrd @ craft.camp.clarkson.edu | | | | `` Homo sapiens : planetary cancer ? ? ...

I guess for DOS users who think multi-tasking is really _neat_ ( add puke here ) and are overjoyed to be able to use more than 64K of memory , its a major improvement . For Windows users its more like an upgrade with facilities most Unix users take for granted . Most of Windows users only use PCs for text processing or running 3rd-party applications anyway so the operating system features are not even a real issue . My ideal operating system : Binary compatible across all plaforms . It should recognize binaries and configure on the fly , so I do n't have to have bin/Mac bin/DOS bin/Dec bin/Sun bin/HP etc ... Multi-CPU . So I can use the CPUs on my PC and W/S and Mac and Transputers and DSPs . I do n't know a single site which has gone for a single vendor . I am not going to trade-in 80Mflops per H1 transputer or ultra-fast FFT on DSP chips . Note NT runs on Symmetric multi-CPU systems . Built-in portable GUI/Graphics tools . You can call DrawButton or DrawLine and it does the same thing no matter what platform or display . It should also translate graphics commands on-the-fly . so I can use PC graphics S/W on my workstation and X software on my PC . I think GUIs are not just nice to have but essential . Configurable front-end . So you can make it look like Unix or DOS or NT or OS/2 , and run shell scripts or command/BAT files . Object oriented . So I can program easily under it and not have to re-invent the wheel if the networking is not up to scratch or my application needs to access source/object code on the fly . In other words it should have some AI capability . That and a tight , clean kernel so you can actually understand it .

In most cases information you come by properly is yours to use as you wish , but there are certainly exceptions . If you write a paper which includes sufficiently detailed information on how to build a nuclear weapon , it is classified . As I understand the law , nuclear weapons design is _automatically_ classified even if you do the work yourself . I believe you are then not allowed to read your own paper . A less serious example : if you tell drivers about a speed trap they are about to run into , you can be fined , even though you might argue that you broke no law when you discovered the location of the policeman . The charge is interfering with a police officer , which is quite similar what you would be doing by reverse engineering the Clipper chip .

I am having some problems utilizing the 24 bit color and would greatly appreciate any help in this matter . I use Xview to create a Frame and then create a canvas pane inside which I use to display live video . My video input is 24 bit color . The problem is that my top level frame created as frame = ( Frame ) xv_create ( NULL , FRAME , NULL ) ; seems to have a depth of 8 which is propagated to my canvas . I would like to know how I can set the depth of the frame to be 24 bits . I tried using the following Xlib code : XVisualInfo visual_info ; int depth = 24 ; Colormap colormap ; XSetWindowAttributes attribs ; unsigned long valuemask = 0 ; Window *win ; Xv_opaque frame ; win = xv_get ( frame , XV_XID ) ; XMatchVisualInfo ( display , screen , depth , TrueColor , & visual_info ) ; /* So far so good */ colormap = XCreateColormap ( display , win , visual_info , AllocNone ) ; /* It dies here with a BadMatch error : ( */ attribs.colormap = colormap ; valuemask |= CWColormap ; XChangeWindowAttributes ( display , w , valuemask , & attribs ) ; XSetWindowColormap ( display , win , colormap ) ; Am I using a completely wrong approach here ? Is it possible to set the depth and colormap for a window created by Xview ? What am I doing wrong ? Thanks in advance for any help that I can get .

They are just responding in their natural way : Hyper-Choleric Syndrome ( HCS ) . Oops , that is not a recognized `` illness '' in the psychological community , better not say that since it therefore must not , and never will , exist . : ^ ) Actually , it is fascinating that a disproportionate number of physicians will type out as NT ( for those not familiar with the Myers-Briggs system , just e-mail me and I 'll send a summary file to you ) . In the general population , NT 's comprise only about 12 % of the population , but among physicians it is much much higher ( I do n't know the exact percentage - any help here a.p.p.er 's ? ) One driving characteristic of an NT , especially an NTJ , is their obvious choleric behavior ( driver , type A , etc . ) - the extreme emotional need to control , to lead , and/or to be the best or the most competent . If they are also extroverted , they are best described as `` Field Marshalls '' . This trait is very valuable and essential in our society - we need people who want to lead , to strive to overcome the elements , to seek and thirst for knowledge , to raise the level of competency , etc . The great successes in science and technology are in large part due to the vision ( an N trait ) and scientifically- minded approach ( T trait ) of the NT personality ( of course , the other types and temperaments have their own positive contributions as well ) . However , when the NT person has self-image challenges , the `` dark-side '' of this personality type usually comes out , which should be obvious to all . A physician who is a strong NT and who has not learned to temper their temperament will be extremely business-like ( lack of empathy or feeling ) , and is very compelled to have total control over their patient ( the patient must be obedient to their diagnosis and prescription without question ) . I've known many M.D . 's of this temperament and suffice to say I do n't oblige them with a followup visit , no matter how competent I think they are ( and they usually are very competent from a knowledge viewpoint since that is an extreme drive of theirs - to know the most , to know it all ) . Maybe we need more NF doctor 's . : ^ ) Enough on this subject - let 's move on to candida bloom . > Let me tell you who the quacks really are , these are the physicans who have > no idea how the human body interacts with it 's environment and how that > balance can be altered by diet and antibiotics ...

Of course , I believe that I have been misdiagnosed on the net as suffering from 'anal retentivitis ' , but being the phlegmatic I am , maybe I was just a little too harsh on a few people myself in past posts . Let 's all try to raise the level of this discussion above the level of anal effluent . > ...

A poor mucus membrane barrier can let this > happen and vitamin A is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier . In my well-described situation ( in prior posts ) , I definitely was immune stressed . Blood tests showed my vitamin A levels were very low . My sinuses were a mess - no doubt the mucosal lining and the cilia were heavily damaged . I also was on antibiotics 15 times in 4 years ! In the end , even two weeks of Ceftin did not work and I had confirmed diagnoses of a chronic bacterial infection of the sinuses via cat-scans , mucus color ( wo n't get into the details ) , and other symptoms . Three very traditional ENT 's made this diagnosis ( I did not have any cultures done , however , because of the difficulty of doing this right and because my other symptoms clearly showed a bacterial infection ) . Enough of this background ( provided to help you understand where I was when I make comments about my Sporanox anti-fungal therapy below ) . The first question I have is this . Can fungus penetrate a little way into poor mucus membrane tissue , maybe via hyphae , thus causing symptoms , without being considered 'systemic ' in the classic sense ? It is sort of an inbetween infection . > Steve got real upset with Elaine 's doctor because he was using anti-fungals > and vitamin A for her GI problems . If Steve really understoood what > vitamin A does in the body , he would not ( or at least should not ) be calling > Elaine 's doctor a quack . I was concerned , too , because of the toxicity of vitamin A . My doctor , after my blood tests , put me on 75,000 IU of vitamin A for one week only , then dropped it down to 25,000 IU for the next couple of weeks . I also received zinc and other supplementation , since all of these interrelate in fairly complex ways as my doctor explained ( he 's one of those 'evil ' orthomolecular specialists ) . I had a blood test three weeks later and vitamin A was normal , he then stopped me on all vitamin A ( except for some in a multi-vitamin ) supplement ) , and made sure that I maintain a 50,000 IU/day of beta carotene . Call me carrot face . : ^ ) Hopefully , Elaine 's doctor will take a similar , careful approach and to all supplements . I 'm even reevaluating some supplements I 'm taking , for example , niacin in fairly large dosages , 1 gram/day , which Steve Dyer had good information about on sci.med.nutrition . If niacin only has second-order improvement in symptomatic relief of my sinus allergies , then it probably is not worth taking such a large dose long-term and risking liver damage . > survives . If it gets access to a lot of glucose , it blooms and over rides > the other organisms living with it in the sinuses , GI tract or vagina . In Though I do now believe , based on my successful therapy with Sporanox , that I definitely had some excessive growth of fungus ( unknown species ) in my sinuses , I still want to ask the question : have there been any studies that demonstrate candida `` blooms '' in the sinuses with associated sinus irritation ( sinusitis/rhinitis ) ? ( My sinus irritation reduced significantly after one week of Sporanox and no other new treatments were implemented during this time - I did not have any noticeable GI track problems before starting on Sporanox , but some for a few days after which then went away - considered normal ) . BTW , my doctor dug out one of his medical reference books ( sorry , can't remember which one ) , and found an obscure comment dating back into the 1950's which stated that people can develop contained ( non-lethal or non-serious ) aspergillis infestations ( aspergiliosis ) of the sinuses leading to sinus inflammation symptoms . I 'll have to dig out that reference again since it is relevant to this discussion . > some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus > membrane or skin bloom site . Whether this is an allergic like reaction to > the candida or not is n't certain . My doctor tested me ( I believe a RAST or RAST similar test ) for allergic response to specificially Candida albicans , and I showed a strong positive . Another question , would everybody show the same strong positive so this test is essentially useless ? And , assuming it is true that Candida can grow part-way into the mucus membrane tissue , and the concentration exceeds a threshold amount , could not a person who tests as having an allergy to Candida definitely develop allergic symptoms , such as mucus membrane irritation due to the body 's allergic response ? As I said in an earlier post , one does not need to be a rocket scientist , or have a M.D . degree or a Ph.D. in biochemistry to see the plausibility of this hypothesis . BTW , and I 'll repost this again . Dr. Ivker , in his book , `` Sinus Survival '' , has routinely given , before anything else , Nizoral ( a pre-Sporanox systemic anti-fungal , not as safe and not as good as Sporanox ) to his new chronic sinusitis patients IF they have been on antibiotics four or more times in the last two years . He claims that out of 2000 or so patients , well over 90 % notice some relief of sinus inflammation and other symptoms , but it does n't cure it by any means , implying the so-called yeast/fungus infection is not the primary cause , but a later complication . He 's also found that nystatin , whether taken internally , or put into a sinus spray , does not help . This implies ( of course assuming that excessive yeast/fungus bloom is aggravating the sinus inflammation ) that the yeast/fungus has grown partway into the tissue since nystatin will not kill yeast/fungus other than by direct contact - it is not absorbed into the blood stream . Again , I admit , lots of 'ifs ' , and 'implies ' , which does n't please the hard-core NT who has to have the double-blind study or it 's a non-issue , but one has to start with some plausible hypothesis/explanation , a strawman , if you will . > If it 's internal , only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty > nondescript . This brings up an interesting observation used by those who will deny and reject any and all aspects of the 'yeast hypothesis ' until the appropriate studies are done . And that is if you ca n't observe or culture the yeast `` bloom '' in the gut or sinus , then there 's no way to diagnose or even recognize the disease . And I know they realize that it is virtually impossible to test for candida overbloom in any part of the body that can not be easily observed since candida is everywhere in the body . It 's a real Catch-22 . Another Catch-22 : Those who totally reject the 'yeast hypothesis ' say that no studies have been done ( actually studies have been done , but if it 's not up to a certain standard then it is , from their perspective , a non-study which should not even be considered ) . I agree that the appropriate studies should be done , and that will take big $ to do it right . However , in order to convince the funding agencies in these austere times to open their wallets , you literally have to give them evidence , and the only acceptable evidence to compete with other proposals is paradoxically to do almost the exact study needed funding . That is , you have to do 90 % of the study before you even get funding ( as a scientist at a National Lab , I 'm very aware of this for the smaller funded projects ) . I 'm afraid that even if Dr. Ivker and 100 other doctors got together , pooled their practice 's case histories and anecdotes into a compelling picture , and approach the funding agencies , they would get nowhere , even if they were able to publish their statistical results . It is obvious from the comments by some of the doctors here is that they have *decided* excessive yeast colonization in the gut or sinuses leading to noticeable non-lethal symptoms does not exist , and is not even a tenable hypothesis , so any amount of case histories or compiled anecdotal evidence to the contrary will never change their mind , and not only that , they would also oppose the needed studies because in their minds it 's a done issue - excessive yeast growth leading to diffuse allergic symptoms does not , will not , and can not exist . Period . Kind of tough to dialog with those who hold such a viewpoint . Kind of reminds me of Lister ... > Candida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in > the sinuses , the GI tract ( mouth , stomach and intestines ) and in the > vaginal tract which compete with it for food . The human immune system > ususally does not bother itself with these ( nonpathogenic organisms ) unless > they broach the mucus membrane `` barrier '' .

While this low level of vitamin > A does not cause pathology ( blindness ) it does impair the mucus membrane > barrier system . This would then be a predisposing factor for a strong > inflammatory response after a candida bloom . Are n't there also other nutrients necessary to the proper working of the sinus mucus membranes and cilia ? > While diabetics can suffer from a candida `` bloom '' the most common cause of > this type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which > knock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main > competition for candida as far as food is concerned .

But if the GI or sinus > inflammation is suspected to be candida ( and recent use of a broad spectrum > antibiotic is the smoking gun ) , then anti-fungal use should be approrpriate > just as the anti-fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring > vaginal yeast infections , in spite of what Mr. Steve Dyer says . Again , the evidence from mycological studies indicate that many yeast/fungus species can grow hyphae ( `` roots '' ) into deep tissue , similar to mold growing in bread . You can continue to kill the surface , such as nystatin does , but you ca n't kill that which is deeper in the tissue without using a systemic anti-fungal such as itraconazole ( Sporanox ) or some of the older ones such as Nizoral which are more toxic and not as effective . This is why , as has been pointed out by recent studies ( sent to me by a doctor I 've been in e-mail contact with - thanks ) , that nystatin is not effective in the long- term treatment of GI tract `` candidiasis '' . It 's like trying to weed a garden by cutting off what 's above the ground but leaving the roots ready to come out again once you walk away . The $ 60000 question is whether a contained candida `` bloom '' can partially grow into tissue through the mucus membranes , causing some types of symptoms in susceptible people ( e.g. , allergy ) , without becoming `` systemic '' in the classical sense of the word - something in between strictly an excessive bloom not causing any problems and the full-blown systemic infection that is potentially lethal . > In the GI system , the ano-rectal region seems to be a particularly good > reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very > favorable environment around the rectum for transfer ( through moisture and > humidity ) of candida to the vaginal tract .

Also , if one is an 'anal retentive ' , like I 've been diagnosed in a prior post , that can also provide more sites for excessive candida growth . ; ^ ) > If the bloom occurs in the anal area , the burning , swelling , pain and even > blood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids .

As I 've said in private e-mail , there are flaws in our current medical system that make it difficult or even impossible for a physician to attempt alternative therapies AFTER the approved/proven/accepted therapies do n't work . For example , I went to three ENT 's , who all said that I will just have to live with my acute/chronic sinusitis after the ab 's failed ( they did mention surgery to open up the ostia , but my ostia were n't plugged and it would not get to the root cause of my condition ) . After three months of aggressive and fairly non-standard therapy ( Sporanox , body nutrient level monitoring and equalization , vitamin C , lentinen , echinacea , etc . ) , my health has vastly improved to where I was two years ago , before my health greatly deteriorated . Of course , skeptics would say that maybe if I did nothing I would have improved anyway , but that view is stretching things quite far because of the experience of the three ENT 's I saw who said that I 'd just have to `` live with it '' . I 'm confident I will reach what one could call a total `` cure '' . The anti-fungal program I undertook was one necessary step in that direction because of my overuse of ab 's for the last four years . ( Note : for those having sinus problems , may I suggest the book by Dr. Ivker I mention above . Be sure to get the revised edition . ) > ... I have often wondered what an M.D . with chronic > GI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his > patients is a non-existent syndrome . Dr. Ivker started off having chronic and severe sinus problems , and his visits to several ENT 's totally floored him when they said `` you 'll just have to live with it '' . He spent several years trying everything - standard and non-standard , until he was essentially cured of chronic sinusitis . He now shares his approach in his book and I can honestly say that I am on the road to recovery following some parts of it . His one recommendation to take a systemic anti-fungal at the beginning of treatment IF you have a history of anti-biotic overuse has been proven to him time and time again in his own practice . I 'm sure if I commented to him of the hard-core beliefs of the anti- '' yeast hypothesis '' posters that he would have definite things to say , such as , '' it 's worked wonders for me in almost two thousand cases '' , to put it mildly . I also would not be surprised if he would say that they are the ones violating their moral obligations to help the patient . Maybe those doctors who are reading this who have a practice and are confronted by a patient having symptoms that could be due to the `` hypothetical yeast overgrowth '' ( e.g. , they fit some of the profiles the pro-yeast people have identified ) , should consider anti-fungal therapy IF all other avenues have been exhausted . Remember , theory and practice are two different things - you can not have one without the other , they are synergistic . If a doctor does something non-standard yet produces noticeable symptomatic relief in over a thousand of his patients , should n't you at least sit up and take notice ? Maybe you ought to trust what he says and begin hypothesizing why it works instead of why it should n't work . I 'm afraid a lot of doctors have become so enamored with `` scientific correctness '' that they are ignoring the patients they have sworn to help . You have to do both ; both have to be balanced , which we do n't see from some of the posters to this group . There comes a point when you just have to use a little common sense , and maybe an empirical approach ( such as trying a good systemic anti-fungal such as Sporanox ) after having exhausted all the other avenues . I was one of those who the traditional medical establishment was not able to help , so I did the natural thing : I went to a couple of doctor 's who are ( somewhat ) outside this establishment , and as a result I have found significant relief . Would it not be better if the traditional medical establishment can set up some kind of mechanism where any doctor , without fear of being sued or having his license pulled , can try experimental and unproven ( beyond a doubt ) therapies for his/her patients that finally reach the point where all the accepted therapies are ineffective ? I 'd like to hear a doctor tell me : '' well , I 've tried all the therapies that are approved and accepted in this country , and since they clearly do n't work for you , I now have the authority to use experimental , unproven techniques that seem to have helped others . I ca n't promise anything , and there are some risks . You will have to sign something saying you understand the experimental and possibly risky nature of these unproven therapies , and I 'll have to register your case at the State Board . '' Anyway , if my ENT had suggested this to me , I would 've jumped on this pronto instead of going to one of those doctors who , for either altruistic reasons , or for greed , is practicing these alternative therapies with much risk to him/her ( risk meaning losing their license ) and possibly to the patient . Such a mechanism would keep control in the more mainstream medicine , and also provide valuable data that would essentially be free . It also would be morally and ethically better than the current system by showing the compassion of the medical community to the patient - that it 's doing everything it can within reason to help the patient . It is the lack of such a mechanism that is leading large numbers of people to try alternative therapies , some of which seem to work ( like my case ) , and others of which will never work at all ( true quackery ) .

I am , however , a devoted Quicken user , and I can tell you how to set up the weekly , monthly , quarterly , yearly transactions . First use the Memorize feature ( CTRL-M ) to record the recurring transactions . Next , define a transaction group which uses these memorized transactions and specify the frequency that it should be used ( i.e . monthly ) . Quicken will/can not automatically make the transactions for you , but now all you do is recall the group and all of the individual transactions will be entered at once . Additionally if you are using the Bill Minder , it will remind you when each transaction group is due . For example , you could have three transaction groups . One for payments at the beginning of the month , middle of the month , and one for quarterly payments . I hope this helps . Mike

Organization : The Portal System ( TM ) Lines : 11 Phenylketonuria is a disease in which the body can not process phenylalanine . It can build up in the blood and cause seizures and neurological damage . An odd side effect is that the urine can be deeply colored , like red wine . People with the condition must avoid Nutrasweet , chocolate , and anything else rich in phenylalanine . Aspartame is accused of having caused various vague neurological symptoms . Pat Robertson 's program _The_700_Club_ was beating the drum against aspartame rather vigorously for about a year , but that issue seems to have been pushed to the back burner for the last year or so .

Need I say more ? > ... I harbor no beliefs at all , there is no good evidence for god > existing or not . Some folks call this agnosticism . It does not suffer > from `` blind faith '' at all . I think of it as `` Do n't worry , be happy '' . For many atheists , the lack of belief in gods is secondary to an epistemological consideration : what do we accept as a reliable way of knowing ? There are no known valid logical arguments for the existence of gods , nor is there any empirical evidence that they exist . Most philosophers and theologians agree that the idea of a god is one that must be accepted on faith . Faith is belief without a sound logical basis or empirical evidence . It is a reliable way of knowing ? There is probably nothing else most people would accept in the absence of any possibility of proof . Even when we agree to take someone elses word `` on faith '' , we just mean that having found this person to be reliable in the past , we judge him likely to be a reliable source now . If we find faith less reliable than logic and empirical evidence everywhere else , why assume it will provide reliable knowledge about gods ? The difference between the atheist and the theist is fundamentally then one of whether or not faith is held to be a reliable way of knowing , rather than , as some agnostic posters would have it , whether ones faith is in gods or no gods . The theist believes that faith is an acceptable basis for a belief in gods , even if he rejects faith as reliable at other times , for example in his work as a scientist . The atheist believes that only logic and empirical evidence lead to reliable knowledge . Agnosticism seems to me a less defensible position than theism or atheism , unless one is a sceptic in regards to all other knowledge . Without evidence , why should we believe in gods rather than Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny ? I would also like to point out as others have that the atheist doesn't require absolute knowledge of the lack of gods . I do n't believe that there is any such thing as absolute knowledge . Atheism is the best and simplest theory to fit the ( lack of ) facts and so should be held until contrary evidence is found . David Nye ( nyeda @ cnsvax.uwec.edu ) .

What I was trying to say was that if you plan to blow by somebody at a very HIGH speed differential and you assume you are safe because the guy sees you , you are stupid ( of course , it depends on the circumstances ) . I have had some VERY scary instances when I assumed this and I dont think all of the fault was the other guy ( now if he was going 25 in a 55 thats a whole different story ) ok . I can agree to this , because , as we have both proved , what is ideally SUPPOSED to happen , is n't always . And even though i 'm rearely the one doing the passing , i do n't see where it makes you stupid , but i agree , that if you think you are SAFE , because the other guy is SUPPOSED to have been paying attention , then yes , you are just as dumb as the other ( maybe dumber ? ) hasta DREW
