EDT THE PRESIDENT : On February the 28th , four federal agents were killed in the line of duty trying to enforce the law against the Branch Davidian compound , which had illegally stockpiled weaponry and ammunition , and placed innocent children at risk . Because the BATF operation had failed to meet its objective , a 51-day standoff ensued . The Federal Bureau of Investigation then made every reasonable effort to bring this perilous situation to an end without bloodshed and further loss of life . The Bureau 's efforts were ultimately unavailing because the individual with whom they were dealing , David Koresh , was dangerous , irrational , and probably insane . He engaged in numerous activities which violated both federal law and common standards of decency . He was , moreover , responsible for the deaths and injuries which occurred during the action against the compound in February . Given his inclination towards violence and in an effort to protect his young hostages , no provocative actions were taken for more than seven weeks by federal agents against the compound . This weekend I was briefed by Attorney General Reno on an operation prepared by the FBI , designed to increase pressure on Koresh and persuade those in the compound to surrender peacefully . The plan included a decision to withhold the use of ammunition , even in the face of fire , and instead to use tear gas that would not cause permanent harm to health , but would , it was hoped , force the people in the compound to come outside and to surrender . I was informed of the plan to end the siege . I discussed it with Attorney General Reno . I asked the questions I thought it was appropriate for me to ask . I then told her to do what she thought was right , and I take full responsibility for the implementation of the decision . Yesterday 's action ended in a horrible human tragedy . Mr. Koresh 's response to the demands for his surrender by federal agents was to destroy himself and murder the children who were his captives , as well as all the other people who were there who did not survive . He killed those he controlled , and he bears ultimate responsibility for the carnage that ensued . Now we must review the past with an eye towards the future . I have directed the United Stated Departments of Justice and Treasury to undertake a vigorous and thorough investigation to uncover what happened and why , and whether anything could have been done differently . I have told the departments to involve independent professional law enforcement officials in the investigation . I expect to receive analysis and answers in whatever time is required to complete the review . Finally , I have directed the departments to cooperate fully with all congressional inquiries so that we can continue to be fully accountable to the American people . I want to express my appreciation to the Attorney General , to the Justice Department , and to the federal agents on the front lines who did the best job they could under deeply difficult circumstances . Again , I want to say as I did yesterday , I am very sorry for the loss of life which occurred at the beginning and at the end of this tragedy in Waco . I hope very much that others who will be tempted to join cults and to become involved with people like David Koresh will be deterred by the horrible scenes they have seen over the last seven weeks . And I hope very much that the difficult situations which federal agents confronted there and which they will be doubtless required to confront in other contexts in the future will be somewhat better handled and better understood because of what has been learned now . Q Mr. President , can you , first of all , tell us why , after 51 days , you decided -- Q Mr. President , can you describe for us what it is that Janet Reno outlined to you in your 15-minute phone conversation with -- THE PRESIDENT : I ca n't hear you both . If one will go first and then the other . Q Sorry . Can you describe what Janet Reno -- Q Mr. President -- THE PRESIDENT : I 'll answer both your questions , but I ca n't do it at once . Q Can you describe what she told you on Sunday about the nature of the operation and how much detail you knew about it ? THE PRESIDENT : Yes . I was told by the Attorney General that the FBI strongly felt that the time had come to take another step in trying to dislodge the people in the compound . And she described generally what the operation would be -- that they wanted to go in and use tear gas which had been tested not to cause permanent damage to adults or to children , but which would make it very difficult for people to stay inside the building . And it was hoped that the tear gas would permit them to come outside . I was further told that under no circumstances would our people fire any shots at them even if fired upon . They were going to shoot the tear gas from armored vehicles which would protect them and there would be no exchange of fire . In fact , as you know , an awful lot of shots were fired by the cult members at the federal officials . There were no shots coming back from the government side . I asked a number of questions . The first question I asked is , why now ? We have waited seven weeks ; why now ? The reasons I was given were the following : Number one , that there was a limit to how long the federal authorities could maintain with their limited resources the quality and intensity of coverage by experts there . They might be needed in other parts of the country . Number two , that the people who had reviewed this had never seen a case quite like this one before , and they were convinced that no progress had been made recently and no progress was going to be made through the normal means of getting Koresh and the other cult members to come out . Number three , that the danger of their doing something to themselves or to others was likely to increase , not decrease , with the passage of time . And number four , that they had reason to believe that the children who were still inside the compound were being abused significantly , as well as being forced to live in unsanitary and unsafe conditions . So for those reasons , they wanted to move at that time . The second question I asked the Attorney General is whether they had given consideration to all of the things that could go wrong and evaluated them against what might happen that was good . She said that the FBI personnel on the scene and those working with them were convinced that the chances of bad things happening would only increase with the passage of time . The third question I asked was , has the military been consulted ? As soon as the initial tragedy came to light in Waco , that 's the first thing I asked to be done , because it was obvious that this was not a typical law enforcement situation . Military people were then brought in , helped to analyze the situation and some of the problems that were presented by it . And so I asked if the military had been consulted . The Attorney General said that they had , and that they were in basic agreement that there was only one minor tactical difference of opinion between the FBI and the military -- something that both sides thought was not of overwhelming significance . Having asked those questions and gotten those answers , I said that if she thought it was the right thing to do , that she should proceed and that I would support it . And I stand by that today . Q Mr. President -- THE PRESIDENT : Wait . Go ahead . Q Can you address the widespread perception -- reported widely , television , radio and newspapers -- that you were trying somehow to distance yourself from this disaster ? THE PRESIDENT : No , I 'm bewildered by it . The only reason I made no public statement yesterday -- let me say -- the only reason I made no public statement yesterday is that I had nothing to add to what was being said and I literally did not know until rather late in the day whether anybody was still alive other than those who had been actually seen and taken to the hospital or taken into custody . It was purely and simply a question of waiting for events to unfold . There was -- I have -- I ca n't account for why people speculated one way or the other , but I talked to the Attorney General on the day before the action took place . I talked to her yesterday . I called her again late last night after she appeared on the Larry King Show , and I talked to her again this morning . A President -- it is not possible for a President to distance himself from things that happen when the federal government is in control . I will say this , however . I was , frankly , surprised would be a mild word , to say that anyone that would suggest that the Attorney General should resign because some religious fanatics murdered themselves . ( Applause . ) I regret what happened , but it is not possible in this life to control the behavior of others in every circumstance . These people killed four federal officials in the line of duty . They were heavily armed . They fired on federal officials yesterday repeatedly , and they were never fired back on . We did everything we could to avoid the loss of life . They made the decision to immolate themselves . And I regret it terribly , and I feel awful about the children . But in the end , the last comment I had from Janet Reno , is when -- and I talked to her on Sunday -- I said , now , I want you to tell me once more why you believe -- not why they believe -- why you believe we should move now rather than wait some more . And she said , it 's because of the children . They have evidence that those children are still being abused and that they 're in increasingly unsafe conditions , and that they do n't think it will get any easier with time -- with the passage of time . I have to take their word for that . So that is where I think things stand . Q Can we assume then that you do n't think this was mishandled in view of the outcome , that you did n't run out of patience ? And if you had it to do over again , would you really decide that way ? THE PRESIDENT : No -- well , I think what you can assume is just exactly what I announced today . This is a -- the FBI has done a lot of things right for this country over a long period of time . This is the same FBI that found the people that bombed the World Trade Center in lickety-split , record time . We want an inquiry to analyze the steps along the way . Is there something else we should have known ? Is there some other question they should have asked ? Is there some other question I should have asked ? Can I say for sure that no one -- that we could have done nothing else to make the outcome come different ? I do n't know that . That 's why I want the inquiry and that 's why I would like to make sure that we have some independent law enforcement people , not political people , but totally non-political , outside experts who can bring to bear the best evidence we have . There is , unfortunately , a rise in this sort of fanaticism all across the world . And we may have to confront it again . And I want to know whether there is anything we can do , particularly when there are children involved . But I do think it is important to recognize that the wrong-doers in this case were the people who killed others and then killed themselves . Q Mr. President , were there any other options presented to you for resolving this situation at any point from February 28th until yesterday ? THE PRESIDENT : Well , yes , I got regular reports all along the way . There were lots of other options pursued . If you go back -- you all covered it very well . The FBI -- you did a very good job of it . I mean , the FBI and the other authorities there pursued any number of other options all along the way , and a lot of them early on seemed to be working . Some of the children got out , some of the other people left . There was a -- at one point , there seemed to be some lines of communication opening up between Koresh and the authorities . And then he would say things and not do them and things just began to spin downward . Whether there were other -- in terms of what happened yesterday , the conversation I had with the Attorney General did not involve other options except whether we should take more time with the present strategy we were pursuing -- because they said they wanted to do this , because they thought this was the best way to get people out of the compound quickly before they could kill themselves . That 's what they thought . Q Did the government know that the children did not have gas masks ? Q congressional hearings once the situation -- are you in agreement with that ? THE PRESIDENT : That 's up to the Congress . They can do whatever they want . But I think it 's very important that the Treasury and Justice Departments launch this investigation and bring in some outside experts . And as I said in my statement , if any congressional committees want to look into it , we will fully cooperate . There is nothing to hide here . This was probably the most well-covered operation of its kind in the history of the country . Go ahead , Sarah . Q There are two questions I want to ask you . The first is , I think that they knew very well that the children did not have gas masks while the adults did , so the children had no chance because this gas was very -- she said it was not lethal , but it was very dangerous to the children and they could not have survived without gas masks . And on February 28th -- let 's go back -- did n't those people have a right to practice their religion ? THE PRESIDENT : They were not just practicing their religion , they were -- the Treasury Department believed that they had violated federal laws , any number of them . Q What federal laws -- THE PRESIDENT : Let me go back and answer -- I ca n't answer the question about the gas masks , except to tell you that the whole purpose of using the tear gas was that it had been tested ; they were convinced that it would n't kill either a child or an adult but it would force anybody that breathed it to run outside . And one of the things that I 've heard -- I do n't want to get into the details of this because I do n't know -- but one of the things that they were speculating about today was that the wind was blowing so fast that the windows might have been opened and some of the gas might have escaped and that may be why it did n't have the desired effect . They also knew , Sarah , that there was an underground compound -- a bus buried underground where the children could be sent . And they were -- I think they were hoping very much that if the children were not released immediately outside that the humane thing would be done and that the children would be sent someplace where they could be protected . In terms of the gas masks themselves , I learned yesterday -- I did not ask this fact question before -- that the gas was supposed to stay active in the compound longer than the gas masks themselves were to work . So that it was thought that even if they all had gas masks , that eventually the gas would force them out in a nonviolent , nonshooting circumstance . MS. MYERS : Last question . Q Mr. President , why are you still saying that -- Q Could you tell us whether or not you ever asked Janet Reno about the possibility of a mass suicide ? And when you learned about the actual fire and explosion what went through your mind during those horrendous moments ? THE PRESIDENT : What I asked Janet Reno is if they had considered all the worse things that could happen . And she said -- and , of course , the whole issue of suicide had been raised in the public -- he had -- that had been debated anyway . And she said that the people who were most knowledgeable about these kinds of issues concluded that there was no greater risk of that now than there would be tomorrow or the next day or the day after that or at anytime in the future . That was the judgment they made . Whether they were right or wrong , of course , we will never know . What happened when I saw the fire , when I saw the building burning ? I was sick . I felt terrible . And my immediate concern was whether the children had gotten out and whether they were escaping or whether they were inside , trying to burn themselves up . That 's the first thing I wanted to know . Thank you . Q Mr. President , why are you still saying it was a Janet Reno decision ? Is n't it , in the end , your decision ? THE PRESIDENT : Well , what I 'm saying is that I did n't have a four- or five-hour , detailed briefing from the FBI . I did n't go over every strategic part of it . It is a decision for which I take responsibility . I 'm the President of the United States and I signed off on the general decision and giving her the authority to make the last call . When I talked to her on Sunday , some time had elapsed . She might have made a decision to change her mind . I said , if you decide to go forward with this tomorrow , I will support you . And I do support her . She is not ultimately responsible to the American people ; I am . But I think she has conducted her duties in an appropriate fashion and she has dealt with this situation I think as well as she could have . Thank you . ( Applause . ) END1:55 P.M. EDT

From : turpin @ cs.utexas.edu ( Russell Turpin ) Subject : History & texts ( was : Ancient references to Christianity ) Organization : CS Dept , University of Texas at Austin Lines : 78 NNTP-Posting-Host : saltillo.cs.utexas.edu Summary : In response to Mike Cobb . -* -- -- In article < C5ztJu.FKx @ news.cso.uiuc.edu > cobb @ alexia.lis.uiuc.edu ( Mike Cobb ) writes : > Why is the NT tossed out as info on Jesus . I realize it is > normally tossed out because it contains miracles , but what > are the other reasons ? Far from being `` tossed out , '' the gospels are taken , almost universally , as the primary source of information about Jesus . I am curious as to whom Mike Cobb is referring . Who `` tosses out '' the New Testament ? Undoubtedly a few *naive* atheists do this , but the phrasing of the question above seems to suggest that Cobb ascribes this more broadly . Perhaps the question that gets more to the heart of the matter is why , except for some *naive* believers ( who , unfortunately , far outnumber nonbelievers , both naive and critical ) , are the gospels *not* taken as `` gospel truth '' that faithfully records just what happened two thousand years ago ? This has an easy answer , and the answer has *nothing* to do with miracles : no text is taken this way by a critical reader . There is a myth among some naive believers that one takes a text , measures it by some set of criteria , and then either confirms the text as `` historically valid '' or `` tosses out '' the text . I suspect this myth comes from the way history is presented in primary and secondary school , where certain texts are vested with authority , and from writers such as Josh McDowell who pretend to present historical arguments along these lines for their religious program . In fact , most texts used in primary and secondary school history classes ought to be tossed out , even the better such texts should not be treated as authoritatively as descibed above , and Josh McDowell would not know a historical argument if it bit him on the keister twice . Let me present the barest outlines of a different view of texts and their use in studying history . First , all texts are historically valid . ALL texts . Or to put this another way , I have never seen a notion of `` historical validity '' that makes any sense when applied to a text . Second , no text should be read as telling the `` gospel truth '' about historical events , in the way that many students are wont to read history texts in primary and secondary school . NO text . ( This includes your favorite author 's history of whatever . ) Every text is a historical fact . Every text was written by some person ( or some group of people ) for some purpose . Hence , every text can serve as historical evidence . The question is : what can we learn from a text ? Of what interesting things ( if any ) does the text provide evidence ? The diaries of the followers of the Maharishi , formerly of Oregon , are historical evidence . The gospels are historical evidence . The letters of the officers who participated in the vampire inquests in Eastern Europe are historical evidence . The modern American history textbooks that whitewash `` great American figures '' are historical evidence . These are all historical evidence of various things . They are *not* much evidence at all that the Maharishi , formerly of Oregon , could levitate ; that Jesus was resurrected ; that vampires exist ; or that `` great American figures '' are as squeaky clean as we learned in school . They are better evidence that some people `` saw '' the Maharishi , late of Oregon , levitate ; that some of the early Christians thought Jesus was resurrected ; that many people in Eastern Europe '' saw '' vampires return from the grave ; and that we still have an educational system that largely prefers to spread myth rather than teach history . How does one draw causal connections and infer what a piece of historical evidence -- text or otherwise -- evinces ? This is a very complex question that has no easily summarized answer . There are many books on the subject or various parts of the subject . I enjoy David Hackett Fischer 's `` Historian 's Fallacies '' as a good antidote to the uncritical way in which it is so easy to read texts present history . It 's relatively cheap . It 's easy to read . Give it a try . Russell

We used to use a system at the shop made by Tellurometer in South Africa . It used a 10 GHz signal between 2 units across the distance to be measured . The 10 GHz was just the carrier : the real signals were several switched ones around 7.5 MHz or so , whose relative phases at the receiver would read out the digits of the distance down to 10 cm if needed . The units came with psychrometers ( sp ? ) to measure the relative humidity and instructions for correction of the measurements due to RH and temp . They were rather heavy and required an operator at each end . Current technology uses polarized reflectors , dual polaization TX/RX and psuedo-random coding of a radar pulse . about the same resolution at X band , much better at 47GHz .

We believe in > both . Curiously enough , this subject has occupied a good bit of my prayer life recently . God 's experience of time is so completely different from our own , since He is both within and without it . Using words like `` foreknowledge '' and `` predestination '' are semantically incorrect when it comes to describing God 's perception of our action , because , for God , the beginning , living , and ending of our lives are all the same . Sort of . For God , there is no `` before '' when He did not know , so he could not have `` foreknowledge '' of our lives or a time when he could have `` predestined '' our actions . In fact , since our understanding of things is so tied to our linear experience of time , I would say that it is impossible for us to understand completely how our free will interacts with God 's control of the universe .

To quote Unger 's Bible Dictionary on the Apocrapha : 1 . They abound in historical and geographical inaccuracies and anachronisms . 2 . They teach doctrines which are false and foster practices which are at variance with sacred Scripture . 3 . They resort to literary types and display an artificiality of subject matter and styling out of keeping with sacred Scripture . 4 . They lack the distinctive elements which give genuine Scripture their divine character , such as prophetic power and poetic and religious feeling . > : > : My interim conclusion is that Protestant exclusion of > : ( at least one of ) these writings is one of those 'traditions > : of men ' one hears of so often .

But the problem with this argument lies in the assumption that the Hebrew canon included the Apocrapha in the first place , and it was n't until the sixteenth century that Luther and co. threw them out . The Jewish council you mentioned previously didn't accept them , so the reformation protestants had good historical precedence for their actions . Jerome only translated the apocrapha under protest , and it was literally 'over his dead body ' that it was included in the catholic canon . > The simple fact is that Protestant exclusion , Roman inclusion , Orthodox > inclusion of still other books , or any other definition of a closed canon > is the decision of a community of faith about what the standard collection > of scripture shall be for that community .

How do you then view the words : `` I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book : If anyone adds anything to them , God will add to him the plagues described in this book . And if anyone takes away from this book the prophecy , God will take away from him his share in the tree of life and in the holy city '' ( Rev 22.18-9 ) Surely this sets the standard and not just man-made traditions . It is also noteworthy to consider Jesus ' attitude . He had no argument with the pharisees over any of the OT canon ( John 10.31-6 ) , and explained to his followers on the road to Emmaus that in the law , prophets and psalms which referred to him - the OT division of Scripture ( Luke 24.44 ) , as well as in Luke 11.51 taking Genesis to Chronicles ( the jewish order - we would say Genesis to Malachi ) as Scripture . > See Dr. Lee MacDonald 's _The Formation of the Christian Biblical Canon_ > ( Abingdon , 1988 ) for a clear and faithful examination of the origins and > issues of the canon .

Lines : 22 I was privelged enough to experience my first Volvo attack this weekend . I was last in a line of traffic that was about 6 vehicles long , riding down Rt . 40 in Groton Ma . At the side of the road , sitting off on the shoulder was the killer Volvo in question . No brake lights , no turn signal , nothing . We were doing about 40 mph and I was following the cage in front of me about 2.5-3 sec . back . Well , as said cage passes the Volvo , the Brain Dead Idiot ( tm ) behind the wheel decides that she does n't need to wait for me to pass also and turns out perpendicular across both lanes of traffic so that she can turn around ... So I get on the brakes in a effort to not T-bone it , and the horn in an effort to wake the BDI up . As she finishes the turn , she looks up at me with a completely blank , uncomprehending stare .

You know , I 'm a Ford fan , I must say , so I 'm looking forward to the next Mustang . I have faith that it will be a fine product , more desireable than the Camaro is now . You know , that 's MHO . The differences these days between Ford and GM are not so much the quality , just the philosophy . It used to be quality _and_ philosophy . GM is barely catching up , but they have more room for improvement that can only be made up in time . STSs still come off the assembly line with screwed up paint stripes and poor trunk/door/hood/panel alignments ; it 's those 75 year old plants . And the latest GM products still come with the standard equipment RattleDash ( tm ) . But like I said , they're getting better and making the move in the right direction . They beat Ford to the market with the Camaro/Firebird , but really only in words . Production of these vehicles will be limited until the end of the year , keeping selling prices above MSRP for the most part since there are so many twitching Camaro fans out there . I wouldn't press Ford to hurry the Mustang since the final wait could be worth it . Besides , no bow-tie fanatic is gon na buy the Mustang anyway . I do not put much stock in the mag rags ' `` inside '' information , or even Ford rep quotes . The Taurus was pretty much a surprise when it was finally disclosed in it 's entirety . `` Inside '' information had the Taurus with a V8 and rear-wheel drive at one point . I would n't look for a simple re-paneled Mustang , folks ; you may be cheating yourself if you do . There 's a lot of potential . Ford has n't released a new car without a 4-wheel IS in 7 years . The Mustang project has been brewing for at least 4 , right ? A 4-wheel IS could happen . Those modular V8 's are out there , too . In the interest of CAFE and competition , do n't rule those out , either . Your ignorant if you do . And there are so many spy shots and artist renderings out there , who really knows what it 'll look like ? The Mach III ? Doubt it . Highly . The next Mustang will be Ford 's highest profile car . It attracts way more attention than the Camaro/Firebird because it 's heritage is more embedded in the general public . Do n't lie to yourself and believe Ford will forfeit that . I submit that the Mustang will be a success . Enough to elicit defensive remarks from some heavy Camaro fans here . You know , intelligent , critical spews like , `` The Mustang bites , man ! '' Some of you are already beginning . I predict that the Mustang and Camaro will be comparable performers , as usual . I predict that the differences will be in subjective areas like looks and feel , as usual . The Camaro is still a huge automobile ; the Mustang will retain its cab-rearward styling and short , pony-car wheelbase . The Camaro still reaches out to the fighter pilot , while the Mustang will appeal to the driver . The Camaro will still sell to the muscle car set , while the Mustang will continue to sell to the college-degreed muscle car set . Both will be more refined ( I do think the Camaro is ) . There will be no clear winner . Unless the Ford gets the 32v , 300hp Romeo .

Not in gamma rays , though . You 'd hafta get all of that into gammas if they were at 9 Mpc , but if a decent fraction of the SN output was in gammas it could reasonably be extragalactic ( but closer than 9 Mpc ) .

Nobody disputes that OS/2 has more big OS features . The question is Does an individual need the power . The sales of Windows vs OS/2 answer that question . The next question is even if I did want to run OS/2 and I had this big monster machine to run it on , is there a diverse set of applications to run on it that allow me to productviely do my work . Go to your local computer store to answer this one . I think the comparison you need to be doing is NT vs OS2/2.1 . This is where the new battle lines will be drawn . Windows 3.1 has won the single user PC war the next one will be the client server war and the entries are NT , OS2/2.1 , UNIX and Netware 4.0 .

From : allan @ cs.UAlberta.CA ( Allan Sullivan ) Subject : Don Cherry - Coach 's Corner summary - April 23 , 1993 Nntp-Posting-Host : swanlake.cs.ualberta.ca Organization : University of Alberta , Edmonton , Canada Lines : 80 Here 's a summary of Don Cherry 's Coach 's Corner from April 23 , 1993 . It was taken from a tape delay of a Vancouver-Winnipeg game , but it was filmed during the Toronto-Detroit game that night . I think it was also shown during the Calgary-LA game . ( Warning ... Anti-fighting people may want to skip this post . ) Topics -- -- -- Don 's Tie , Doug Gilmour , Wings/Leafs , Quebec/Montreal , Boston/Buffalo , Wendel Clark , Fighting and Stickwork . Episode Summary -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Once again , the episode started with a shot of Don 's tie ... This was a different tie than last time . Don pointed out some of the characters on the tie , but gave them different names ... Felix the Cat ( Sylverster ) , Maclean ( Daffy Duck ) , etc . Ron Maclean asked Don what he thought of the current Wings-Leafs game . Don thought it was good . Burns told the Leaf players `` They won in their building , we 're going to win in ours '' . Don then began to praise Gilmour again . Don pointed out that Gilmour has never got less than 2 points or a goal in any game since he got 5 points in a game against St. Louis . ( Don also claims that he gave a lot of encouragement to Gilmour , which was partly responsible for his good play . ) Several clips were then shown of Gilmour from the series ... A hit on Constantinov , and a pass to Andrewchuk resulting in a goal . On the game itself , the Wings were taking a lot of penalties in the first period . The Wings have enough talent to score short handed however , and when the Leafs get a power play , Coach Burns tells the Leaf players `` Do n't let them score on you '' . Ron brought up the previous Quebec-Montreal game . [ Note : Montreal won that game in overtime , despite having a possible game winner disqualified because it was batted in with a high stick . ] Don thought the high stick was obvious , even without the use of instant replay . On the Buffalo-Boston series [ Note : Buffalo is currently winning the series 3-0 ] , Don gave full credit to Goaltender Grant Fuhr . Fuhr should be getting 1/2 the team 's playoff checks for his play . Wendel Clarke has recently been criticized for his performance during the Detroit-Toronto series . Don defended him , by saying that he ca n't play the way he should , because of the league's new rules . `` This used to be a rough and tough league ... Now its all hack and slash . '' Don lays the blame on Gil Stien for the problems . Don 's opinions on fighting and stickwork are shared by Wings GM and coach Bryan Murray . A clip from a news conference by Murray was shown , in which Murray made statements claiming the elimination of fighting increases stickwork . Don also read a newspaper article in which Murray makes the following statements : `` Players do n't fight because they 're afraid of getting thrown out of the game as instigator . Instead , they settle grudges by getting their sticks and slicing each other . Is this what the fans want to see ? I guarantee there would n't be as many slashes if fighting were kept in the game . '' Don warned league commisioner Gary Bettman to `` smarten up '' with fighting in hockey . He went on to say that before , there used to be one guy cut with a high stick in a series . Now , with no fights , someone gets cut every period . Rating -- -- -- Typical anti-fighting posturing , but here Don 's opinion is supported by Murray . I 'd give it a 7.0 out of 10 .

Gas is much more expensive , so people are very concerned about it taking a few more liters per kilometer . This , along with narrow old cities , also results in smaller cars with smaller engines . These engines usually do n't have the torque to mesh well with an automatic . So , having engines that do n't work well with autos , and a great concern for milage , the usual Euro-car has a manual . ( Note that not many big Benzes come with manuals . If you 've got the money for the car , you 've got the money for the gas , and the engine to drive through the slushbox . ) As automatics become more efficient , the `` bigotry '' is probably reduced . Still , everyone knows how to drive a manual , and cars are cheaper with one , and it saves a little expensive fuel . So there are n't compelling reasons to go automatic . -dB --

As I stated , religion There are various contradictory views on the origin of the Armenians . The name is to be found in the Darian inscriptions in the form 'Armina' or 'Aramaniya ' is to be found in the inscription on the Bistun monument . The following references to the Armenians are to be found in the Bistun cuneiform inscription of Dara Vishdasb ( 510 B.C. ) . 1 . The monarch Dara said : I sent my servant to Arminam 'Armeniya ' . 6 . On reaching Arminam 'Armeniya ' . 7 . To the country town of Zozo , to Armaniya 'Armeniya ' . According to Karakashian : As for 'Armenia ' , the equivalent of the 'Armin ' or 'Arminik ' of the Persians , this is more recent than the word 'Ararat ' , and is to be found used in the Dara inscriptions for 'Haiastan ' . Saint Martin : The name 'Armenie ' has been given since very early times by almost all the various eastern peoples to the territory referred to by the Armenians as 'Haiastan ' . It was known to the Syrians as Armenia and to the Arabs as Ermeniyye . Others believe that Urartu was known in the time of the Medes as 'Harminap' which was later modified by the Persians to 'Arminia ' . 'Ar ' refers to a place , as in Ararat , Archish , Aruyr , Archar , Arshav , Arazen and Aror , while 'men ' is used to refer to spirit , thought or human being , and therefore 'Armen ' would appear to signify 'the people of that place ' . G. Alishan believes that 'according to our national vocabulary `` Haik '' is the diminutive form of `` Hai '' , and that `` Hai '' is the name of our nation . Our nation is in no way connected with the word `` Armen '' that foreigners apply to our people . ' It would thus appear that 'Armenia ' is a place-name , that 'Armen ' is the name of the people who lived there , and that these are in no way connected with the word 'Hai ' . Haik and Haiastan : Armenian historians believe Haik to have been a great hero from whom the Armenian people took the name 'Hai ' . But the mere resemblance between the words 'Haik ' and 'Hai ' constitutes no real proof , and , in any case , no such theory appears before the time of Moses of Khoren . Haiasa : The following studies show quite clearly that 'Hai ' and 'Haiasa ' were no more than general names used by the Hittites to refer to the region known as Armenia . Professor Hachadurian : 'Haiasa was the general name used in Hittite inscriptions for Upper Armenia . ' Yensen , in his 'Hittites and Armenians ' tries to prove that 'Hai ' is identical with the Hittite 'Hatio ' , in other words that 'Hai ' is a Hittite word . Research , however , has proved this erroneous , and shown that 'Hai ' was derived from 'Hatio ' . Mortman 's attempt to read the Urartu inscriptions as Armenian met with no success . As for Greek , there is no point in even mentioning it . The resemblance between the words 'Haiasa ' and 'Haiastan ' is so obvious that we may well accept 'Haiasa ' as the oldest form of 'Haiastan ' . Let us now cast a brief glance on how the words 'Hai ' , 'Haikazan ' and 'Haiastan ' entered our older works . According to Karakashian : 'The word `` Haik '' is never to be found employed with reference to a leader of the Armenian people prior to Moses of Khoren , nor is it ever found employed in the forms `` Haika '' or `` Haykazn '' . Agahangelos and Puzant use the word as a title or a place-name ( he improved and developed Haiastan , etc. ) . If the word had referred to a nation and had been derived from `` Hai '' or `` Haik '' they could also have used the words `` Haikak '' and `` Haykazn '' in a number of places . ' According to Professor Sayce , who deciphered a number of Hittite inscriptions : 'In the Hittite language the suffix -ha is used to specify quality or species . The words `` Haddanas '' , `` Haddina '' were used by the Assyrians to refer to the Hittites . With the transformation of the '' d '' between the two `` a '' letters to `` y '' `` Hadinasdani '' was in this way transformed to `` Haiastan '' ' . Professor Grechmer fully agrees with this point of view , but regards the significance and explanation so far accorded to the terms 'Hai' and 'Haistan ' as quite unsatisfactory . He finds , however , that a solution to this problem is brought nearer by the name 'Haiasa ' which is so frequently found in Bogazkoy from 1400 B.C . onwards . Forrer takes 'Haiasa ' as referring to Upper Armenia . In that case it seems likely that 'Haiasa ' was actually a part of Armenia . The suffix -dan is of Anatolian origin . The real root is 'Hayasa ' , which refers to the country of the 'Hayasas ' . E. Chantre writes as follows on the subject of the ethnological and Anthropological characteristics of the Armenian people . The Armenians in Russia may be characterized as follows : Almost all of them are brachycephalic or leptocephalic , very dark , above average height , an Aissores Asian group with close ties with certain Kurdish tribes and Azerbaijan peoples . According to J. Deniker : From the philological point of view , the Armenian and Kurds may be regarded as belonging to the Iranian group ... The Armenians are descended from various elements and from a very mixed race . Their average height varies between 1.63 and 1.69 according to the region . They are almost always short-headed , with skull measurements of 85-87 . As a race they belong to the Indo-Afghan-Assyrian-Turkic family . Professor Rene Vernont writes as follows : The Armenians are a mixture of Semites , Turk , Kurds and Mongols , but some of them display Armenian features , e.g. , height a little above average , fair complexion , dark hair , dark eyes , very often a hooked nose and a rather wide mouth . Investigations carried out by N. Kossovitch on the links between Armenian blood groups and their anthropological characteristics led him to the conclusion that the Armenians did not form a distinct race . Serdar Argic 'We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the Turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination . ' ( Ohanus Appressian - 1919 ) 'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists a single Turkish soul . ' ( Sahak Melkonian - 1920 )

No , the thing is designed to be retrievable , in a pinch . Indeed , this dictated a rather odd design for the solar arrays , since they had to be retractable as well as extendable , and may thus have indirectly contributed to the array-flapping problems . The retrieval problems are exactly as stated : it would be costly , would involve extensive downtime ( and the worry of someone finding a reason not to re-launch it ) , and would unnecessarily expose the telescope to a lot of mechanical stresses and possibilities for contamination . -- SVR4 resembles a high-speed collision | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology between SVR3 and SunOS . - Dick Dunn | henry @ zoo.toronto.edu utzoo ! henry

When I print from , say , MS Word , I see the message `` Spooling to disk , '' but sometimes nothing prints . Checking my memory map thanks to Now Menus , I see that HP Backgrounder has not loaded . Restarting fixes this . It seems to me that HP Backgrounder is quitting unexpectedly , and that its status as `` Multifinder NOT aware '' allows it to do this without my being informed by a message such as `` HP Backgrounder quit unexpectedly . '' Have you ever seen this problem before . There may or may not be a related problem . I have experienced problems in putting my computer to sleep . Choosing `` sleep '' from the Finder menu sometimes does nothing . Today on a whim I checked the memory map , and I discovered that HP backgrounder was not loaded . Restarted reloaded HP backgrounder , and I was able to put my machine to sleep as usual . Just a mere coincidence or is the HP backgrounder crash preventing my machine from going to sleep ? Has anyone seen this problem ? I 'm seriously considering the purchase of a StylewriterII because of the poor quality of the HP software . Please send your answers directly to me and post to the net . Yours truly , Marc Bizer

From : maa @ plato.ds.boeing.com ( Mark A Allyn ) Subject : Clipper Chip : Reverse Engineering Organization : Boeing Defense & Space Group Lines : 26 I have been looking over the postings about the Clipper Chip and noticed an interesting omission from the discussion . You all mention that the algorithm is classified and have expressed concerns and ideas of how to figure out the algorithm using software . The question that I have is why cant someone take one of these chips and reverse engineer it ? I mean , take the thing to a chip testing/ analysis facility , one with a decent electron microscope . Just pry off the top of the chip and start scanning it with the electron microcope and figure out the circuitry . I remembered a place that I use to work for had one of these facilities that they used to analyze chips that we accidently blew out while running tests . They could actually find the area that was fried and show us where in the circuit it was . I am sure that many companies and universities must have these facilities and that the potential is there , especially at a university where the security at such a facility is looser , for someone to take a clipper apart and analyze it ? What can the government do to prevent this ? Start taking away all microchip analysis facilities and electron microscopes ? ? mark

Yes , but ( a ) we were talking about peak level , not career averages and ( b ) Clemente was the best fielding RF of all time , as far as anyone can tell I did a quick scan last night , looking for players with a peak comparable to or better than Winfield . In my quick-n-dirty subjective judgement , you could make good cases for Ruth , Aaron , Ott , Robinson , Clemente , Kaline , Maris , Klein , Jackson , Waner , and probably a few others . This is not a knock on Winfield , but a comment on his consistency : all of those other players had awesome stretches and very good stretches , while Winfield has been more uniformly excellent .

From : wdw @ dragon.acadiau.ca ( Bill Wilder ) Subject : Seeking info on retinal detachment Organization : Acadia University Lines : 40 I am quite near sighted . I 've recently received laser treatment for both eyes to seal holes in the retinas to help prevent retinal detachment . In my left eye a small detachment had begun already and apparently the laser was used to `` weld '' this back in place as well . My right eye seems fine . In my left eye I was seeing occasional flashes of bright light prior to the treatment . Since the treatment ( two weeks ) these flashes are now occuring more often - several each hour . The opthamologist explained the flashes are caused because the vitreous body has attached to the retina and is pulling on it . He says this is not treatable and he hopes it may go away on its own accord - if it tugs enough I may well face retinal detachment . I am seeking ( via sci.med ) additional info on retinal detachments . The Dr. did not wish to spend much time with me in explanations so I appreciate any further details anyone can provide . Of most interest to me : If my retina does detach what should be my immediate course of action ? If conventional surgery is need to repair the detachment what is the procedure like and what kind of vision can I expect afterwards . Do the symptoms ( fairly frequent flashes ) imply that detachment maybe near at hand or is this not necessarily cause for alarm .

Source : `` Hagop Hagopian said to have been part of 1972 Terror Attack at Munich Olympic Games , '' The Armenian Reporter , February 7 , 1985 , p. 1 . `` Le Matin , the influential Paris daily , based on unidentified sources , claimed last week that Hagop Hagopian , the founder and leader of one faction of the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia ( ASALA ) , was among the Arab terrorists who staged an attack on the living quarters of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympic Games ... Le Matin added that up to 1982 , Hagopian operated out of Beirut , Lebanon , but escaped from the country when Israeli forces entered the city . It was about this time that a statement issued by ASALA claimed that Mr. Hagopian was dead of wounds suffered during a bombing by the Israeli Air Force , although it is generally believed that the mysterious leader is alive and well and presently is residing alternately in Damascus , Syria , and Athens , Greece . The paper also noted that the socialist government of Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and his P.A.S.O.K . party accepted the Armenian underground leader with `` open arms '' and still providing him with assistance simply because of Greece 's traditional enmity with Turkey . Le Matin further adds that ASALA derives only a small portion of its expenditures from wealthy Armenians who support the cause , with the rest coming either from other sources or from proceeds of an involvement in drug trafficking .

Yes the govt handled it in the Rambo Hollywood type style with extreeme Machismo . Perhaps thats not the way to handle it . It is a completely different thing to start asserting as many have done that the government is primarily to blame . The comparisons with the NAZIs in particular are purely gratuitous . Since you have provided a constructive opinion on the issue your post desreves to be taken seriously . Peter Nelson also made some very good points about how a low key approach might have been more effective . The point is though that you learn through mistakes . The govt played the wrong card and lost . Thats not a big deal . They had had four guys murdered at the begining and maybee they just were not prepared for wuite this situation . Who could be ? If the same thing were to happen all over again we might perhaps be able to castigate the Govt if they used the same tactics and failed in the same way . As it is I ca n't say that I would not have made the same mistake . Maybee I would n't because I do n't as a rule go in for a confrontational situation if I can avoid it . Maybee I would because with all those press about its very difficult not to try the macho stuff . The FBI had information from within the compound we had no access to . They may have calculated that the B-D followers resolve was cracking based on their listening devices within the compound . They knew that Koresh had chickened out of one suicide attempt . This may have been the reason why they considered that fear might have been a weapon for breaking his resolve . Again in Panama they had used the heavy rock music to great effect during Bush 's invasion . Funny that few of the Koresh supporters and appologists complain much about the death of several thousand Pananmanian civilians while the US govt attempted to arrest their former ally . | > And please let 's not turn this into a pro-gun vs. anti-gun | > discussion .

Koresh negated his civil rights the minute his followers fired on the police helicopter . No matter whether the warrant was or was not technically valid the guys who were carrying it out thought that it was . Thus the assault on them was completely inexcusable no matter what rationalisation people might wish to employ . Of course we have to consider the guns issue .

Hathaway The problem is no-one seems to have the exact numbers . When the mission was planned originally at 3 spacewalks , and 3 astronauts , there was enormous concern over the mass margins for the flight . THey have now planned for 5 EVA 's , an 11 day mission and have 2 reserve EVA 's and an emergency EVA . Obviously that is coming from somewhere . My guess is the OMS burn fuel , or re-boost margin . I just figured , if GOldin wants to really , prove out faster , cheaper better , have some of the whiz kids slap together an expendable space manuevering tug out of a BUs1 , and use that for the re-boost . it has to be better then using the Discovery as a tow truck . pat

Yes , its a horrible way to go , but apparently not so horrible that someone with enough religious conviction might not be able to carry it through .

In addition to the change in title , the revised ETR BOM has been shortened by several pages ( eliminating many extraneous `` that 's '' and `` of 's '' ) , and many ( minor ) errors have been corrected . This release includes a simplified Joseph Smith Story , testimonies of the three and eight witnesses , and a `` Words-to-Know '' glossary . As with the previous announcement , readers are reminded that this is a not-for-profit endeavor . This is a copyrighted work , but people are welcome to make *verbatim* copies for personal use . People can recuperate the actual costs of printing ( paper , copy center charges ) , but may not charge anything for their time in making copies , or in any way realize a profit from the use of this book . See the permissions notice in the book itself for the precise terms . Negotiations are currently underway with a Mormon publisher vis-a-vis the printing and distribution of bound books . ( Sorry , I 'm out of the wire-bound '' first editions . '' ) I will make another announcement about the availability of printed copies once everything has been worked out . FTP information : connect via anonymous ftp to carnot.itc.cmu.edu , then `` cd pub '' ( you wo n't see anything at all until you do ) . `` The Easy-to-Read Book of Mormon '' is currently available in postscript and RTF ( rich text format ) . ( ASCII , LaTeX , and other versions can be made available ; contact dba @ andrew.cmu.edu for details . ) You should be able to print the postscript file on any postscript printer ( such as an Apple Laserwriter ) ; let dba know if you have any difficulties . ( The postscript in the last release had problems on some printers ; this time it should work better . ) RTF is a standard document interchange format that can be read in by a number of word processors , including Microsoft Word for both the Macintosh and Windows . If you do n't have a postscript printer , you may be able to use the RTF file to print out a copy of the book . -r -- r -- r -- 1 dba 1984742 Apr 27 13:12 etrbom.ps -r -- r -- r -- 1 dba 1209071 Apr 27 13:13 etrbom.rtf For more information about how this project came about , please refer to my article in the current issue of _Sunstone_ , entitled `` Delighting in Plainness : Issues Surrounding a Simple Modern English Book of Mormon .

Organization : UTexas Mail-to-News Gateway Lines : 29 NNTP-Posting-Host : cs.utexas.edu I 'm looking for a circuit that will flash an led on in response to the output from a walkman cassette player . How could I do this ? I do n't want it just to turn on , I want it to 'strobe ' once so to speak , per every beep I put on a cassette tape . Would it be better to use a circuit based on the volume of the beeps on the cassette , or better for the leds to respond to a tone of a certain frequency ? Is there any easy way to do either of these ? I 'm looking for the simplest circuit possible . I guess what I 'm asking for is some sort of color organ , but not quite . Let me trt to explain again ... I 'm going to have a pattern of beats ( or beeps ) on a cassette tape . So on the tape you 'd hear : beep ! ( pause ) beep ! ( pause ) beep ! ( pause ) ..etc . , with speed increasing as time goes on . I want to synchronize an LED ( probably two of them ) with the beeps on the cassette tape . So the LED , with each beep , would go on and off real quick , generating a strobe light sort of effect . The rapidity of the beeps on the tape would in turn effect the rapidity of the blinking of the LEDS . And if there was no sound on the tape ( except for background his ) , the LEDs would remain off .

In any case , past actions do not And the best evidence you can find is second hand hearsay from an unnamed source ? You may indeed be confusing *some* Muslims with Nazi Armenians . Altogether 30,000 Nazi Armenians served in various units in the German Wehrmacht , according to Ara J. Berkian . 14,000 in predominantly Armenian army units , 6,000 in German army units , 8,000 in various working units and 2,000 in the Waffen-SS . [ 1 ] A number of these Nazi Armenians were volunteers from France , Greece , Rumania and Bulgaria who had chosen to commit themselves to the German war effort . Derounian says that '' Dashnag Armenians from France bore the mark 'Legion Armenienne . ' '' [ 2 ] That Nazi Armenians like Dro 'the Butcher ' and Nezhdeh sided with the Germans probably had an impact on the decision of Armenians who overwhelmingly opted for armed service .

[ 2 ] John Roy Carlson ( Arthur Derounian ) , in 'The Armenian Displaced Persons , ' ibid. , p. 19 . In fall 1942 , the Armenian infantry battalions 808 and 809 were formed , to be followed by battalions 810 , 812 and 813 in spring 1943 . In the second half of 1943 infantry battalions 814 , 815 and 816 were created . These battalions together with other indigenous Caucasian units were attached to the infantry division 162 . Also attached to ID 162 were the field battalions II/9 , I/125 and I/198 which were formed between May 1942 and May 1943 . Altogether twelve Armenian battalions served the Nazi army , if battalion II/73 , which was not employed at any time , is to be included . [ 1 ] Most battalions were commanded by Nazi Armenian officers . Armenians wore German uniforms with an armband in the Dashnag colours red-blue-orange and the inscription 'Armenien . ' [ 1 ] Joachim Hoffmann , 'Dies Ostlegionen 1941-1943 , Turkotataren , Kaukasier und Wolgafinned im deutschen Heer , ' ( Verlag Rombach Freiburg 1976 ) , p. 172 . While having collaborated with the Nazis against Stalin during the Second World War , Nazi Armenians changed their policy after Hitler's defeat . They now backed Stalin 's claims on Eastern Turkish provinces , hoping that these would be annexed to Soviet Armenia and their Muslim population would be exterminated . Stalin played on Armenian national sentiments to enlist the support of Armenians in the USSR and America for his imperial ambitions .

It should be remembered that all of the first reports came from the FBI , and that independent observers , i.e . the press , were not allowed to get close and see things for themselves . Official communiques tend to be self-serving for the agencies that issue them . People in general tend to believe first reports , as these get the most and the biggest headlines . Corrections are often overlooked . An example is the FBI report that several of the bodies found in the rubble had bullet wounds .

As Shai points out , political appointments are based on power . They are also based on favors owed , coalition building , and deal making . While this may have a racist element to it , I think that its much more fair to attribute it to the `` old boy '' nature of politics .

I tried the M0 , but then even the logon was muted . I do n't want that . Any other suggestions for that hissing ? The second is really strange . First , I kept mentioning that FC slowed down all the time and took too long . Well I just logged on with extensions off and I did n't have any slowdown . Also , last time I was online I quit ( which usually disconnects and quits ) . It disconnected but it would n't quit . I had to force quit , and then when I launched FC again it said the modem port was in use . This is really strange . I thought it might have to do with fax software . Or the restart could have reset the modem port ( a more likely explanation ) . So , any suggestions ? -David **** From Planet BMUG , the FirstClass BBS of BMUG .

I was also shocked when I first realized that you have to offset lines from fills by about 16 bits ( assuming 24 bit z buffer ) . This seems huge , but is only 1/256 of the dynamic range . In those terms it does n't seem so bad . What is happening is that the interpolation in z is not totally linear , due mainly to roundoff , I believe . So the polygon is not planar in z , but is more like a Ruffles potato chip . Ditto with lines . When you start/end at different x/y values , the `` ridges '' are out of phase , resulting in the stitch effect . You have the same problem if you try to draw 1 polygon right on top of another , but with different vertices . You will likely see a smeared effect where they overlap . Example : Try Polygon 1 : ( 100,100,100 ) ( 100,200,100 ) ( 200,200,100 ) ( 200,100,100 ) Polygon 2 : ( 125,125,100 ) ( 125,175,100 ) ( 175,175,100 ) ( 175,125,100 ) Your implementation is correct . In fact , we do a similar trick when rendering primitives that have lines and polygons - such as NURBS surfaces with isoparametric lines . Without the trick , the lines appear stitched , as you say . When the application draws lines/polygons independently , the system does not have the smarts to automatically do the z shifting , so the application must do it . This is what you have discovered and are doing . Bravo !

This is misleading , at best . The question , really , has to do with the status of the Greek Septuagint versus Hebrew scripture . And the issue predates the Reformation by quite a bit -- Jerome was negative about the '' deuteroncanonicals '' and in fact , even though he transalted them , he put them after the Hebrew canon ( reordered from the Greek ordering to the Hebrew one . ) His translations of them were quick-and-dirty , also ( he reports having done one of them in one day , and another overnight , just dictating his translation to an amanuensis . That is to say , it is the Vulgate , and all of its massive importance in Western Christianity , along with the veneration of Jerome , which took the first steps in `` reducing '' these books from the status they had ( and have ) among the Greeks . Furthermore , it is inaccurate to say that the Reformers `` threw out '' these books . Basically , they just placed them in a secondary status ( as Jerome had already done ) , but with the additional warning that doctrine should not be based on citations from these ALONE . I think that the emphasis on the Hebrew originals is sound , though it seems somewhat arbitrary to disallow on the face of it a translation as part of a collection whose principles of selection ( in Hebrew or Greek ) are confused or unknown and likely fraught with accident . It also seems to play into a tendentious notion of the original languages being somehow '' more inspired '' -- as if magical , and conveying a message untranslatable -- than a translation , as if we could not hear God 's word to the Jews in Greek ( or German , or English , ... ) . This tendency seems to have got a big boost in _sola scriptura_ Protestantism , even to the point of current '' inerrancy '' bizarreness , despite the more basic , underlying tendency of the Reformers to see that the texts SHOULD and COULD be translated . If we can profit from an English rendering of Hebrew and Greek , there is surely little reason to keep Sirach , at least , out of our Bibles ( and of course , Anglicans do n't do so : - ) ) . For texts originally in Greek , it would seem more to be anti-Greek prejudice ( notably , by the time the Hebrew canon is fully attested , including anti-Christian prejudice which led to the Jewish abandonment of the Septuagint ) which is operative . BTW : readers may enjoy some lectures of Bruce Metzger on the issues of translation of the Bible ( including some of what I said about Jerome , above ) in the current numbers of the journal _Bibliotheca Sacra_ ; two of four have been published so far . -- Michael L.

'' -- -Compiled by Firyal Alshalalbi Origins of Kuwait The establishment of Kuwait is attributed to Barrak b. Ghurair of the Bani Khalid who used Kuwait as a summer residence . The beginning of Kuwait goes back to the late 17th century and some historians go further up to 1611 . Kuwait 's name is derived from al-Kut which means fortress . Kuwait is also called Qurain , which is the diminutive of qarn , a horn or hill . Kuwait town flourished and grew since its establishment . The 'Utub , al-Sabah family is a branch of 'Utub , settled in Kuwait during the early 18th century . They lived under the protection of Bani Khalid until 1752 . After that , they became independent and Sabah Bin Jabir was chosen as the first ruler for 'Utub . Carsten Niebuhr ( 1733-1815 ) a Dutch explorer was among the first who wrote about the Arabia . He was the mathematician in the scientific expedition sent in 1760 by the King of Denmark to Arabia . He documented details of Arab tribes inhabiting both coasts of the Gulf and in the case of Kuwait , he was the first writer to give the two names by which the town was known , Kuwait and Qurain . Niebuhr 's chart of the Persian Gulf was the best one drawn before the end of that century , see the map from Abu Hakima , History of Eastern Arabia 1750-1800. pub.1965 . Al-Sabah ( 'Utub ) kept good relations with other powers in the eastern Arabia . According to Ahmed Abu Hakima 's conclusions in his well documented study about the history of eastern Arabia between 1750-1800 , there was no Ottoman rule on the region . `` In the second half of the 18th century , there was no Ottoman ruler in Eastern Arabia . In fact , Ottoman rule was not even nominally acknowledged . Their attempts to restore their lost position in al-Hasa through the campaign of Thuwayni in 1786 , and Ali Pasha 's expedition against the Wahhabis in 1798 , were unsuccessful . At Kuwait , the nearest point of the Utbi domains to the Ottoman Mutasallimiyya of Basra , the Shaikh was under no form of Ottoman control . The aim of 'Utbi external policy was to keep on friendly relations with all the forces working in the Gulf . '' ( p. 182-183 ) Abu Hakima continued in his conclusions that `` Kuwait was not a dependency of Basra , the Persian occupation of Basra ( 1775-79 ) did not affect Kuwait . '' ( p.183 ) Kuwait had its own identity through the Ottoman domination on the Arab world . This identity was clear to the British and the French who tried to win the support of Kuwait 's Sheikh between 1793-95 when the British wanted his support in their conflict with the French in the Gulf area . -- - Independent Kuwait This is the first of a series of articles that testify to the independence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the Ottomans . The following text is related to an expedition carried out by the Ottomans in 1871 against the Wahhabis in Eastern Arabia ( where the oil fields in Saudi Arabia now ) . Kuwait and its ruler at that time , Sheikh Abdulla Ibn Sabah Ibn Jabir , allied themselves with the Turks : } Abdullah ' role in the fighting was not a minor one . He joined the expedition as a commander of the large Kuwaiti fleet and was the first to use its guns against the besieged town of Al-Qatif . Had it not been for this bombardment by the Kuwaiti fleet , Al-Qatif obviously would not have surrendered in a mere three hours . In relation to this , a question arises as to why the Ottoman warships refrained from participating in the bombardment . The answer lies in reports relating to the political movements that preceded accounts of the progress of the expedition . Because the Ottomans were unwilling to jeopardize the maritime peace imposed by Britain in the area , the Sultan and the Pasha promised their warships would not be used in the war against Su'ud or any Sheikh in the war zone . Kuwait , which was not a party to the above-mentioned treaty of 1861 , was under no such obligation especially since the expedition was not directed against those who had signed it . [ From the above text , we can see that Kuwait was not part of the Ottomans or the British colonies . For more details about the mentioned expedition , please check out the source of the above text : The Modern History of Kuwait , 1750 -- 1965 , by Ahmed Abu-Hakima , McGill University , Canada ] -- - Independent Kuwait -- 2 This is another article of a series of articles that testify to the independence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the Ottomans . The following text discusses a dispute on an estate called Sufiyya in Zubair , Iraq , between the Sheikh of Kuwait and Al-Zuhair tribe in Zubair . In 1866 , trouble developed over the possession by Sheikh Sabah of the estate which was [ purchased ] by his father , Sheikh Jabir , in 1836 . This property was sequestered by a Turkish Qa'immaqam [ representative ] on the basis of a claim by the Al-Zuhair that the vendor had been the owner of a share and not of the n 100e Sufiyya . At the same time , Sheikh Sabah was required to expel from other lands owned by him at the island of Fao some cultivators who had immigrated from Persian territory . It should be recalled that the Turkish officials from the start showed strong prejudice in favor of the Zuhair claimants . Abdulla Ibn Sabah , the eldest son of the ruler of Kuwait who went to Basra as his father 's agent in the case , narrowly escaped being thrown into jail upon his refusal to make a payment amounting to the value of seven years produce which the Ottoman authorities deemed the plaintiffs were entitled to receive . Eventually , the dispute was settled by the Wali [ Governor ] of Baghdad in favor of the Sheikh of Kuwait . The decision of the Governor of Basra in favor of the Sheikh was apparently made for various reasons . Some writers think that the Governor wanted to win Abdulla over to the Turkish side , and suggest that the Governor , Namiq Pasha , even offered him the title of Qa'immaqam , which he declined . Nevertheless , the proceedings of the Turks in this case were regarded by the inhabitants of Kuwait as attempts to cause a confrontation with Zubair . It seems that they had anticipated a conflict and according to reports by the British Agent at Basra , the people of Kuwait were prepared to a man to abandon their town rather than submit to Turkish rule . Lorimer suggests that the final order of Namiq Pasha , upholding the Kuwait Sheikh 's title to Sufiyya , was perhaps due to a report that Sheikh Sabah , `` with the object of attacking Zubair if the decision should go against him , had obtained a promise of countenance and armed support from the Wahhabi Amir . '' In addition to this legal matter with Zubair , Kuwait had had other problems with Basra whose courts tried to jail Abdulla Ibn Sabah , as explained above . However , Kuwait 's relations with the Ottoman mutasallims of Basra had at times been amicable and in several instances , those mutasallims even sought refuge at Kuwait when pressured by the Pashas of Baghdad who exercised control over them . [ Source : The Modern History of Kuwait , 1750 -- 1965 , by Ahmed Abu-Hakima , McGill University , Canada ] -- - Independent Kuwait -- 3 This is another article that testifies to the independence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the Ottomans . When Pelly [ Colonel Pelly , the British Resident in the Gulf ] visited Kuwait for the first time on March 3 , 1863 , he was met at Jahra by Sheikh Mubarak , the second son of the ruler , Sheikh Sabah . Just before he reached Kuwait town on March 4 , he was met by Sheikh Abdulla , the eldest son and heir apparent , who accompanied him to the town gate on their way to `` a very good home , '' which had been prepared for Pelly and his companions . `` Scarcely had we entered it , '' says Pelly , `` when Sheikh Sabah himself came . '' This description of Pelly 's reception indicates that to a certain degree it was run according to protocol . The government system of Kuwait and administration of justice were the subject of comments made by Pelly . `` The Government is patriarchal , '' says Pelly , `` the Sheikh managing the political , and the Cazee [ Qadi ] the judicial departments . The Sheikh himself would submit to the Cazee 's decision . '' Punishment was rarely inflicted . `` Indeed , there seems little government interference anywhere , and little need of an army . '' Pelly in admiration of how the Sheikh ran the affairs of the country , retold the following remark which the Sheikh had made to him : When my father was nearly 120 years old , he called me and said , `` I shall soon die . I have made no fortune , and can leave you no money , but I have made many and true friends , grapple them . While other states around the Gulf have fallen off from injustice or ill-government , mine has gone on [ flourishing ] . Hold to my policy , and though you are surrounded by desert , and pressed by a once hostile and still wandering set of tribes , you will prosper . '' [ Source : The Modern History of Kuwait , 1750 -- 1965 , by Ahmed Abu-Hakima , McGill University , Canada ] -- - Independent Kuwait -- 4 This is another article that testifies to the independence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the Ottomans . The British had always regarded Sheikh Jabir as a `` good friend , '' but in October 1839 , an event took place at Kuwait which could have weakened those good relations . On October 30 , Lieutenant Edmunds , the Assistant Resident at Abu Shahr [ in Iran ] , arrived in Kuwait on a special mission from the Resident , Captain Hennell . His mission was to find out if Kuwait was willing to welcome the establishment of a British line of post across the desert from Kuwait to the Mediterranean . The British war vessel fired the usual salute in honor of the Sheikh after it had anchored in the waters of Kuwait Bay . The salute was not acknowledged and Edmunds waited in the vessel for three days before he was able to communicate with the Sheikh . After Edmunds ' return to Abu Shahr , both he and Captain Hennell explained this unusual behavior of the Sheikh , to have been due not to ill-will , but principally to a desire to mislead the Egyptian agent at Kuwait as to the nature of his relations with the British . Therefore , they considered that Jabir 's conduct did not indicate any change in his friendly policies towards the British . If the British tolerated the attitude of Jabir towards Edmunds , so also did the Egyptians . Earlier in the same year , some of the most wanted men in the Wahhabi camp , such as 'Umar Ibn 'Ufaisan , the Wahhabi general in Al-Hasa , and Wahhabi tribes like Al-Duwaish , sought refuge in Kuwait . Protection of refugees seeking political asylum in his country was a policy that had been adopted earlier by Sheikh Abdulla Ibn Sabah . This can , therefore , be looked upon as an indication of self-confidence ; an outcome of Kuwait 's independence from foreign powers . It corroborates the fact that Kuwait , if necessary , was prepared to defend itself against more powerful neighbors . This defense depended not only on the walls of the city , but also on bedouin tribes in its neighborhood and a merchant fleet equipped with the necessary guns comparable to other Arab fleets of the time . As to Kuwait 's position between 1815 and 1839 , one can safely state that it managed to maintain a neutral policy with regard to the struggling Wahhabis and Egyptians . Relations with the British and even with the Pasha of Baghdad continued on good terms . [ Source : The Modern History of Kuwait , 1750 -- 1965 , by Ahmed Abu-Hakima , McGill University , Canada ] -- - They were trying to recover land they believed was theirs , much like the Argentines in the Faulklands .

I include the key verse ( D & C 68:25 ) because others may not have the reference . `` And again , inasmuch as parents have children in Zion , or in any of her stakes which are organized , that teach them not to understand the doctrine of repentance , faith in Christ the Son of the living God , and of baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of the hands , when eight years old , the sin be upon the heads of the parents .

Ezekiel 18 teaches a correct principle . However , it assumes that fathers and sons have equal knowledge to prepare for the judgment . Parents are responsible to teach their children the Gospel and other life skills . Should they fail to make a sufficient attempt to teach their children , the parent would be held responsible -- not for their children 's sins , but for not teaching them properly . Whenever the Lord installs someone to a position of authority in either the family or the church He expects that person to teach those in his charge . In Ezekiel 33:7-9 someone called to care for others is likened to `` a watchman unto the house of Israel . '' `` If thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way , that man shall die in his iniquity ; but his blood will I require at thine hand . Nevertheless , if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it ; if he do not turn from his way , he shall die in his iniquity ; but thou hast delivered thy soul . '' Even though the D & C prefaces this commandment with '' parents have children in Zion '' I believe all parents are responsible for teaching their children whatever good principles they understand . However , LDS parents accept greater responsbility and could be judged more strictly . A IDLER

The kind of interpretation I see as `` incredibly perverse '' is that applied to the story of Sodom as if it were a blanket equation of homosexual behavior and rape . Since Christians citing the Bible in such a context should be presumed to have at least READ the story , it amounts to slander -- a charge that homosexuality == rape -- to use that against us . > '' ... Do not be deceived ; neither fornicators , nor idolators , nor adulterers , > nor effeminate , nor homosexuals , nor thieves , nor the covetous , nor drunkards , > nor revilers , nor swindlers , shall inherit the kingdom of God . And such were > some of you ... '' I Cor . 6:9-11 . The moderator adequately discusses the circularity of your use of _porneia_ in this . I think we can all agree ( with Paul ) that there are SOME kinds of activity that could be named by `` fornication '' or `` theft '' or `` coveting '' or '' reviling '' or `` drunkenness '' which would well deserve condemnation . We may or may not agree to the bounds of those categories , however ; and the very fact that they are argued over suggests that not only is the matter not at all `` clear '' but that Paul -- an excellent rhetorician -- had no interest in MAKING them clear , leaving matters rather to our Spirit-led decisions , with all the uncomfortable living-with-other-readings that has dominated Christian discussion of ALL these areas . Homosexual behavior is no different . I ( and the other gay Christians I know ) are adamant in condemning rape -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and child molestation -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and even the possibly '' harmless '' but obsessive kinds of sex -- heterosexual or homosexual -- that would stand condemned by Paul in the very continuation of the chapter you cite [ may I mildly suggest that what *Paul* does in his letter that you want to use is perhaps a good guide to his meaning ? ] `` ' I am free to do anything , ' you say . Yes , but not everything is for my good . No doubt I am free to do anything , but I for one will not let anything make free with me . '' [ 1 Cor . 6:12 ] Which is a restatement that we must have no other `` god '' before God . A commandment neither I nor any other gay Christian wishes to break . Some people are indeed involved in obsessively driven modes of sexual behavior . It is just as wrong ( though slightly less incendiary , so it 's a secondary argument from the 'phobic contingent ) to equate homosexuality with such behavior as to equate it with the rape of God 's messengers . I wo n't deal with the exegesis of Leviticus , except very tangentially . Fundamentally , you are exhibiting the same circularity here as in your assumption that you know what _porneia_ means . There are plenty of laws prohibiting sexual behavior to be found in Leviticus , most of which Christians ignore completely . They never even BOTHER to examine them . They just *assume* that they know which ones are `` moral '' and which ones are `` ritual . '' Well , I have news for you . Any anthropology course should sensitize you to ritual and clean vs. unlcean as categories in an awful lot of societies ( we have them too , but buried pretty deep ) . And I can not see any ground for distinguishing these bits of Leviticus from the `` ritual law '' which NO Christian I know feels applies to us . I 'm dead serious here . When people start going on ( as they do in this matter ) about how `` repulsive '' and `` unnatural '' our acts are -- and what do they know about it , huh ? -- it is a solid clue to the same sort of arbitrary cultural inculcations as the American prejudice against eating insects . On what basis , other than assuming your conclusion , can you say that the law against male-male intercourse in Leviticus is NOT a part of the ritual law ? For those Christians who *do* think that *some* parts of Leviticus can be `` law '' for Christians ( while others are not even to be thought about ) it is incumbent on you *in every case , handled on its own merits* to determine why you `` pick '' one and ignore another . I frankly think the whole effort misguided . Reread Paul : `` No doubt I am free to do anything . '' But Christians have a criterion to use for making our judgments on this , the Great Commandment of love for God and neighbor . If you can not go through Leviticus and decide each `` command '' there on that basis , then your own arbitrary selection from it is simply idiosyncracy . In this context , it is remarkably offensive to say : > I notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the > verse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse . Well , la-ti-da . So what ? This is almost as slimey an argument as the one that homosexuality == rape . I know of no one who argues seriously ( though one can always find jokers ) in `` defense '' of bestiality . It is absolutely irrelevant and incomparable to the issues gay Christians *do* raise ( which concern sexual activity within committed , consensual human adult realtionships ) , so that your bringing it up is no more relevant than the laws of kashrut . If you can not address the actual issues , you are being bloody dishonest in trailing this red herring in front of the world . If *you* want to address bestiality , that is YOUR business , not mine . And attempting to torpedo a serious issue by using what is in our culture a ridiculous joke shows that you have no interest in hearing us as human beings . You want to dismiss us , and use the sleaziest means you can think of to do so . Jesus and Paul both expound , very explictly and in considerable length , the central linch-pin of Christian moral thought : we are required to love one another , and ALL else depends on that . Gay and lesbian Christ- ians challenge you to address the issue on those terms -- and all we get in return are cheap debate tricks attempting to side-track the issues . Christians , no doubt very sincere ones , keep showing up here and in every corner of USENET and the world , and ALL they ever do is spout these same old verses ( which they obviously have never thought about , maybe never even read ) , in TOTAL ignorance of the issues raised , slandering us with the vilest charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can manage to conjure up , tossing out red herrings with ( they suppose ) great emotional force to cause readers to dismiss our witness without even taking the trouble to find out what it is . Such behavior should shame anyone who claims to have seen Truth in Christ . WHY , for God 's precious sake , do you people quote irrelevant verses to condemn people you do n't know and wo n't even take the trouble to LISTEN to BEFORE you start your condemnations ? Is that loving your neighbor ? God forbid ! Is THAT how you obey the repeated commands to NOT judge or condemn others ? Christ and Paul spend ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE more time in insisting on this than the half-dozen obscure words in Paul that you are SO bloody ready to take as license to do what God tells you NOT to do . Why , for God 's sake ? `` For God did not send the Son into the world to condemn the world , but that the world might be saved through him . Whoever believes in him is not condemned , but whoever does not believe has already been condemned for refusing to believe in the name of God 's only Son . Now the judgment is this : the light has come into the world , but men have preferred darkness to light because their deeds were evil . For everyone who practices wickedness hates the light , and does not come near the light for fear his deeds will be exposed . But he who acts in truth comes into the light , so that it may be sh0own that his deeds are done in God . '' John 3:17-21 For long ages , we ( many of us ) have been confused by evil counsel from evil men and told that if we came to the light we would be shamed and rejected . Some of us despaired and took to courses that probably *do* show a sinful shunning of God 's light . Blessed are those whose spirits have been crushed by the self-righteous ; they shall be justified . However , we have seen the Truth , and the Truth is the light of humanity ; and we now know that it is not WE who fear the light , but our enemies who fear the light of our witness and will do everything they can to shadow it with the darkness of false witness against us . -- Michael L.

From : car @ access.digex.net ( Mr. Blue ) Subject : Some rookie questions Organization : Express Access Online Communications , Greenbelt , MD USA Lines : 27 NNTP-Posting-Host : access.digex.net Im new to Xlib programming . Im having a problem I hope someone here can help me with . I create a window , and I want it to have some background color , say red , and draw an oval in it . Further , when I resize the window , I want to be able to redraw the image so that is fills the new window ( whether it is larger or smaller . ) Im using AIXwindows on an RS6000 . My problem is this : when I resize the window , only the `` original '' part of the window that was part of the window creation gets drawn into . Everything else is a grey..the oval `` tries '' to redraw itself but gets clipped . I can see that it WOULD be the right size if I could see all of it , but it only shows up in the region that was the original size of the window when created . For example , I start out the window at 200x200 in width and height . If I resize it to 400x400 , the only part that has any color drawn into it is is from the origin out to 200x200..the rest is grey . Further the oval only shows up in that 200x200 area . What am I doing wrong ? ? How can I get a window to resize and redraw a re-scaled image in it to take up the full size of the window ? Second question : Could someone tell me what Xaw and Xmu are ? ? ? Thanks , Chris
From : loss @ fs7.ECE.CMU.EDU ( Doug Loss ) Subject : Re : Vandalizing the sky . Organization : Electrical and Computer Engineering , Carnegie Mellon I did n't want to quote all the stuff that 's been said recently , I just wanted to add a point . The whole question of `` a right to a dark sky '' revolves around the definition of a right . Moral rights and natural rights are all well and good , but as far as I can see , a right is whatever you or someone representing you can enforce . In most civilizations , the government or the church ( or both ) defines what the rights of the citizens are , and then enforces those rights for them . Here in the U.S. , the constitution provides a `` Bill of Rights '' from which most if not all legal rights are considered to derive . I 'm sure that most other countries have comparable documents . If you can persuade a court that you have a right to a dark sky derived in some manner from the Bill of Rights ( in the U.S. ) , you can prevent ( maybe ) these billboards from being launched . To keep anyone in the world from launching then gets into international law and the International Court of Justice ( correct name ? ) in the Hague , something I know little about .

From : houle @ nmt.edu ( Paul Houle ) Subject : Antihistamine for sleep aid Article-I.D . : nmt.1993Apr29.052044.23918 Organization : Electrical Eng . Dept . - New Mexico Tech Lines : 46 Nntp-Posting-Host : baltic For a very long time I 've had a problem with feeling really awful when I try to get up in the morning . My sleep latency at night is also pretty long , ranging from 30 min to an hour . I get about 7 hours of bedtime ( maybe 6 of actual sleep ) a night and more on the weekends . I will spend two or three hours laying in bed after this if I can , because I feel so tired when I wake up , even more tired than I was when I went to bed , which is usually too tired to work . Anyway , I recently had a really bad flu , so I called a friend to get me some cough syrup with both an expectorant and a nasal decongestant ; but he got Vicks formula 44M which has everything but an expectorant . So I used that anyway , and the three nights I used it , I fell asleep rapidly and felt that I got really good quality sleep -- that is , I actually felt refreshed the next morning . So , I am now trying to look into , both in the literature and experimentally , the use of antihistamines as sleep aids , since I am presuming that it was the antihistamine that caused the effect . The antihistamine in Vicks formula 44 is Chloriphenamine maleate , so I bought some generic tablets of that , and tried one last night and didn't notice any improvement . I might try one with a little alcohol ( about 1 beer ) to see if it is a synergism effect . Also , library research seems to show that Benadryl is the antihistamine with the strongest sedative effect of what is availible OTC . So I might also buy a generic form of that and try that ; the PDR seems to suggest that 50 mg is a good dosage level to try . For other medical information , I have allergies but rarely have an allergic reaction living in New Mexico . I also have chronically dry eyes , which get horrible if I try to use most underarm deoderants . I did guess that my problem might be caused by hypoglycemia , so I made some changes in my diet consistent with that , and it did n't help , so I went back to a normal diet ( Pretty diverse , also taking vitamin supplements ) Anyway , I am looking for advice for the use of antihistamines as sleep aids , and if there are any dangers of such use ( Seems safe to me since they are used chronically for allergies by millions ) . I do n't want to try BZs , because BZ addiction seems to be a serious threat , and from what I hear , BZ sleep quality is not good , whereas antihistamine sleep quality seems to be better for me . I have tried some dietary tryptophan loading stuff , and that also seems to lower sleep quality , I seem to wake up around 4:00 or so and be in some kind of mental haze until 7:00 or 8:00 . Also , I would be interested in any other advice for helping my problem . ( Although I 've already tried many of the non-pharmacological solutions )

From : vzhivov @ superior.carleton.ca ( Vladimir Zhivov ) Subject : Sabres ! ! ! Sweep . Organization : Carleton University Lines : 18 It 's over - the Sabres came back to beat the Bruins in OT 6-5 tonight to sweep the series . A beautiful goal by Brad May ( Lafontaine set him up while lying down on the ice ) ended it . Fuhr left the game game with an injured shoulder and Lafontaine was banged up as well ; however , the Sabres will get a week 's rest so injuries should not be a problem . Montreal edged Quebec 3-2 to square their series , which seems to be headed for Game 7 . The Habs dominated the first two periods and were unlucky to only have a 2-2 tie after 40 minutes . However , an early goal by Brunet in the 3rd won it . The Islanders won their 3rd OT game of the series on a goal by Ray Ferraro 4-3 ; the Caps simply collapsed after taking a 3-0 lead in the 2nd . The Isles ' all-time playoff OT record is now 28-7 . - Vlad the Impaler

Indications were that the spacecraft had entered a Fault Protection mode sometime between that time and receipt of normal telemetry at the end of the previous station pass ( DSS-15 - Goldstone 34 meter antenna ) at approximately 8:00 PM the evening before . Entry into Contingency Mode was verified when signal was reacquired and telemetry indicated that the spacecraft was sun coning . After subsystem engineers reported all systems performing nominally , fault protection telemetry modes were reconfigured and memory readouts of command system Audit Queue and AACS ( Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem ) Starex performed . These readouts verified that Contingency Mode entry occurred shortly after 1:30 AM yesterday , 4/29/93 . Preliminary indications are that a Sun Ephemeris Check failure triggered fault protection . However , the Flight Team will be determining the precise cause over the next few days . As of last evening , the spacecraft had been commanded back to Inertial Reference and was stable in that mode . The Flight Team is planning to command the spacecraft back to Array Normal Spin state today . Magnetometer Calibration activities had completed prior to Contingency Mode entry . MAG Calibration data has been recorded on Digital Tape Recorders 2 and 3 . Playback of DTRs 2 and 3 , scheduled to be completed yesterday , was postponed when Contingency Mode entry halted Flight Sequence C9 execution . The Flight Team is developing a strategy to restart C9 to complete data playback . Present planning is to perform playbacks between as soon as Wednesday , or as late as Friday of next week ( 5/5- 5/7 ) , dependent on Contingency Mode recovery activity . DTR playback will be performed via the High Gain Antenna at 42,667 bits per second . Upon verification of successful DTR playbacks , downlink will be maintained at the 4K S & E rate . ___ _____ ___ /_ /| /____/ \ /_ /| Ron Baalke | baalke @ kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov | | | | __ \ /| | | | Jet Propulsion Lab | ___| | | | |__ ) |/ | | |__ M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand /___| | | | ___/ | |/__ /| Pasadena , CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and |_____|/ |_|/ |_____|/ | part vegetable .

I know for sure that the Everex Magic I/O EV-170A can be jumpered for a printer mode , or for a general purpose bidirectional I/O mode . Also , I know for sure that the IBM Technical Reference says the following about the Monochrome Display & Printer Adapter and the IBM Parallel Printer Adapter : It is essential that the external device not try to pull these lines [ referring to the data lines ] to ground . And later : If an external device should be driving data on these pins ( in violation of usage ground rules ) at the time of an input , this data will be ` or'ed with the latch contents . I will accept no responsibility if you incur damages of any kind as a result of my saying , `` I DO NOT know for sure , but I think you should be able to use a traditional parallel port as an input port by writing 0x to the data lines , and then reading from the data lines , while an external device drives them .

From : kjenks @ gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov Subject : U.S. Government and Technolgy Investment Organization : NASA/JSC/GM2 , Space Shuttle Program Office X-Newsreader : TIN [ version 1.1 PL8 ] Lines : 44 People who criticize `` big Government '' and its projects rarely seem to have a consistent view of the role of Government in science and technology . Basically , the U.S. Government has gotten into the role of supporting research which private industry finds too expensive or too long-term . ( Historically , this role for the U.S. Gov't was forced upon it because of socialism in other countries . In order for U.S. industries to compete with government-subsidized foreign competitors , the U.S. Gov't has taken on the role of subisizing big-ticket or long-lead R & D . ) As a Republican , I abhor the necessity for our Government to involve itself in technology this way . I believe that market forces should drive technology , and the world would be a better place for it . But the whole world would have to implement this concept simultaneously , or some countries would have subsidized R & D , while others would not . So the U.S. must subsidize because everybody else does . ( This sounds a lot like the farm subsidies arguments behind our GATT negotiations , does n't it ? ) But this role of Government subsidies is antithetical to cost-effectiveness . The general idea is to spend money on new technology , and thereby maintain and promote our technological culture , despite the forces in the business world ( like the dreaded quarterly earnings report ) which erode the ability of U.S. industry to invest in new technology . And since our goal is to spend money , it makes little sense to try to save money . Of course , we could always spend our money more wisely , but EVERYBODY disagrees about that the wisdom should be . It 's interesting to note that some of our best tools for cost control available in industry today were derived from Government projects . GANTT charts , CP/M , and most of the modern scheduling software comes from DoD projects and their contractors . The construction industry has taken these tools to the core of their businesses ; every large construction project now uses these tools . -- Ken Jenks , NASA/JSC/GM2 , Space Shuttle Program Office kjenks @ gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov ( 713 ) 483-4368 `` A scientist can discover a new star , but he can not make one .

I understand that lower numbers signify better aerodynamics but > what does this mean in the real world . Is there a way to calculate new top speeds ( assuming the car is not rev limited at top speed ) or mileage benefits if a identical car had the Cd reduced from .34 to .33 . It 's pretty complex , and Cd is n't the whole story either . Cd for cars is usually calculated based on the frontal area of the car . So a large car with a good Cd could get the same drag force as a smaller car with a poorer Cd . To calculate drag use this formula : D = 1/2 * rho * v^2 * Cd * S Where D is the drag force ( lbs ) , rho is the local air density ( slugs/ft^3 ) , V is the velocity ( ft/s ) , and S is the frontal area ( ft^2 ) . Note that the pieces called 1/2 * rho * v^2 are sometimes called qbar or dynamic pressure ( a fancy aero term for air pressure or force ) . Note that power is : P = F * v Where P is power ( lbf-ft/s ) , F is the force , drag in this case ( lbf ) and v is velocity ( ft/s ) . Note that if you put the whole equation into one ( by substituting D for force ) you get a velocity _cubed_ term . That 's why huge increases in power result in little increases in speed . Ditto for decreases in Cd . So if you have a 100 mph car and reduce Cd from .34 to .33 , your new top speed is : ( sound of trumpet fanfare ) 101 mph Sorry to dissappoint . -- Al Bowers DOD # 900 Alfa Ducati Hobie Kottke 'blad Iaido NASA '' Well goodness sakes ... do n't you know that girls ca n't play guitar ?

Are we to > simply assume that you are the only one who really understands it ? Rick , I think we can safely say , 1 ) Robert is not the only person who understands the Bible , and 2 ) , the leadership of the LDS church historicly never has . Let 's consider some `` personal interpretations '' and see how much trust we should put in `` Orthodox Mormonism '' , which could never be confused with Orthodox Christianity . In one of his attacks on Christians , the Mormon Apostle Bruce R. McConkie said they `` thrash around in ... darkness in trying to identify Elohim and Jehovah and to show their relationship to the promised Messiah . '' He also said Christians are wrong to believe `` that Jehovah is the Supreme Deity [ God the Father ] , '' and that Christ `` came into mortality '' as His `` Only Begotten '' Son . McConkie then stated what Mormons believe today to be the truth about the matter . He said that `` Elohim is the Father '' and `` Jehovah is the Son . '' `` Being thus aware of how far astray the religious intellectualists have gone in defining their three-in-one God , it comes as no surprise to learn that they thrash around in the same darkness in trying to identify Elohim and Jehovah and to show their relationship to the promised Messiah . Some sectarians even believe that Jehovah is the Supreme Deity whose Son came into mortality as the Only Begotten . As with their concept that God is a Spirit , this misinformation about the Gods of Heaven is untrue . The fact is , and it too is attested by Holy Writ , that Elohim is the Father , and that Jehovah is the Son who was born into mortality as the Lord Jesus Christ , the promised Messiah . ( Promised Messiah , p. 100 ) Notice that McConkie said the Christians are as wrong about their `` three-in-one God '' and their belief that `` God is a Spirit '' as they are in their understanding of who `` Elohim '' and `` Jehovah '' are . Before examining McConkie 's attack and its validity , we shall read a few more statements by McConkie and other Mormon sources concerning the words '' Elohim '' and `` Jehovah . '' McConkie stated : `` ... the chief designation of Christ that has been preserved for us in the Old Testament , as that ancient work is now published , is the exalted name-title Jehovah . ( Promised Messiah , p. 367 ) `` _Elohim_ , plural word though it is , is also used as the exalted name-title of God the Eternal Father , a usage that connotes his supremacy and omnipotence , he being God above all Gods . ( Mormon Doctrine , p. 224 ) Agreeing with McConkie on the question of who `` Elohim '' and '' Jehovah '' are , the Apostle James E. Talmage stated : `` _Elohim_ , as understood and used in the restored Church of Jesus Christ , is the name-title of God the Eternal Father , whose firstborn Son in the spirit is _Jehovah_ -- the Only Begotten in the flesh , Jesus Christ . ( Jesus the Christ , p. 38 ) `` A Doctrinal Exposition by The First Presidency and the Twelve '' apostles of the Mormon Church states that `` God the Eternal Father ... [ is ] designate [ d ] by the exalted name-title 'Elohim ' ... '' ( Articles of Faith , p. 466 ) `` ... Christ in His preexistent , antemortal , or unembodied state ... was known as Jehovah ... '' ( Articles of Faith , p. 471 ) Today Mormon leaders teach that `` Elohim '' in the OT refers to God the Father and `` Jehovah '' refers to Christ . McConkie attacked Christians for saying `` Jehovah '' can refer to the Father . He stressed that these two '' name-titles '' should not be changed around so that Christ is called '' Elohim '' and the Father is called `` Jehovah . '' `` ... the Father ... is Elohim , not Jehovah ... . Jehovah is Christ , and Christ is Jehovah ; they are one and the same person . '' ( Promised Messiah , p. 111 ) In the OT of the KJV of the Bible , the Hebrew word `` Elohim '' is used to refer to the true God , false gods and goddesses , and the judges of Israel . When referring to the true God , `` Elohim '' is translated with a capital `` G. '' When referring to false gods and goddesses and the judges of Israel , it is translated with a small `` g. '' It is translated four times as `` judges '' ( Exod . 21:6 ; 22:8-9 ) , once as `` judge '' ( 1 Sam . 2:25 ) , twice as `` mighty '' ( Gen. 23:6 ; Exod . 9:28 ) , once as `` angels '' ( Ps . 8:5 ) , once as `` godly '' ( Mal . 2:15 ) , once as `` great '' ( Gen. 30:8 ) , and once as '' very great . '' ( 1 Sam . 14:15 ) The word `` Jehovah '' is the traditional pronunciation of the tetragrammation YHWH or YHVH with the vowel points taken from the word '' Adonai . '' Many people believe the true pronunciation of the tetragrammation was Yahweh or Yahveh . However , since `` Jehovah '' rather than Yahweh is the word used by Mormonism , this section will also use '' Jehovah '' instead of Yahweh to examine the validity of the claims of Mormon leaders regarding that name . `` Jehovah , '' unlike `` Elohim , '' is never used of false gods . It is the personal name of the triune God of the Bible . In the KJV , `` Jehovah '' is rendered primarily `` LORD , '' sometimes '' GOD , '' and rarely `` Lord . '' Now that we understand something about the words `` Elohim '' and '' Jehovah '' and their use by Mormon leaders , we shall consider the Apostle McConkie 's attack on Christians for believing the Father is `` Jehovah . '' In trying to prove that `` Jehovah '' refers exclusively to Christ , McConkie cited several verses from the Bible . Some of these verses and McConkie's interpretation of them will be examined to see whether he was right . Remember , McConkie said the Father is not `` Jehovah ; '' He is only '' Elohim . '' The first example we shall consider involves McConkie's interpretation of Ps . 110:1 . Of this verse he stated : `` Of whom spake David when his tongue was touched by the Holy Spirit and he testified , `` The Lord said unto my Lord , Sit thou at my right hand , until I make thine enemies thy footstool ? '' ( Ps . 110:1 . ) Two Lords are here involved : one is speaking to the other ; one is greater than the other ; one is making provision for the triumph and glory of the other . Who are they and what message is contained in this Messianic prophecy ? `` What think ye of Christ ? '' our Lord asked certain of his detractors toward the end of his mortal ministry . `` Whose son is he ? '' Is Christ the Son of God or of someone else ? Is he to be born of a divine Parent or will he be as other men -- a mortal son of a mortal father ? That he was to be a descendant of David was a matter of great pride to all the Jews . And so they answered , `` The Son of David . '' David 's son ? Truly he was . But he was more , much more . And so our Lord , with irrefutable logic and to their complete discomfiture , asked , `` How then doth David in spirit call him Lord , saying , The Lord said unto my Lord , Sit thou on my right hand , till I make thine enemies thy footstool ? If David then call him Lord , how is he his son ? '' That is , if he is only the Son of David , how is it that the great King , acting under inspiration , calls him Lord and worships him as such ? And we might add : _Who is the other Lord , the one who spake unto David 's Lord ? _ Can there be any question as to how Jesus is interpreting the words of the Psalm ? He is saying that it means : '_The Father said unto the Son , Elohim said unto Jehovah_ , sit thou on my right hand , until after your mortal ministry ; then I will raise you up to eternal glory and exaltation with me , where you will continue to sit on my right hand forever . ' ( Promised Messiah , pp . 101-102 ) ( emphasis added ) Agreeing with the above statement by McConkie , the following remark in the Mormon pamphlet _What the Mormons Think of Christ , p. 6 reads : `` The Lord [ Elohim , the Father ] said unto my Lord [ Jehovah , the Son ] ... '' ( brackets in original ) McConkie clearly stated that it is `` Elohim '' the Father who is speaking to `` Jehovah '' the Son in this Psalm . However , when one looks at the Hebrew word translated `` LORD , '' it becomes apparent that either the first `` LORD '' is not the Father or else the Father is `` Jehovah . '' Either way McConkie is wrong . The Psalm reads : `` The LORD [ Jehovah ] said unto my Lord [ Adon ] , Sit thou at my right hand , until I make thine enemies thy footstool . ( Ps . 110:1 ) The first `` LORD '' in this verse is `` Jehovah '' who Mormonism says is Christ , not the Father . The second `` Lord '' is the Hebrew word `` Adon '' ( singular for `` Adonai , '' meaning master or lord ) . If the first `` LORD '' is the Father and the second `` Lord '' is the Son , then the Father is '' Jehovah '' and the Son is `` Adon . '' However , if the Father is not `` Jehovah '' as McConkie claimed , then the first `` LORD '' is `` Jehovah '' the Son , but who , then , is `` Adon ? '' Obviously the Father is `` Jehovah '' in this Psalm , and His Son is `` Adon . '' Another example involves Isa . 42:6 about which McConkie stated the following : `` I the Lord have called thee in righteousness , '' _Isaiah quoted the Father as saying of Christ_ , `` and will hold thine hand , and will keep thee , and give thee for a covenant of the people , for a light of the Gentiles . '' ( Isa . 42:6 . ) ( Promised Messiah , p. 81 ) ( emphasis added ) McConkie said the Father was speaking of Christ in this passage which reads : `` I the LORD [ Jehovah ] have called thee in righteousness , and will hold thine hand , and will keep thee , and give thee for a covenant of the people , for a light of the Gentiles . ( Isa . 42:6 ) According to McConkie , `` I the LORD '' refers to the Father , and '' thine '' and `` thee '' refer to Christ . However , the `` LORD '' who is speaking is `` Jehovah '' which means either McConkie was wrong about who is speaking or else the Father is `` Jehovah . '' Another example involves Ps . 22:7-8 . Of these verses McConkie stated : `` The same Psalm says : `` All they that see me laugh me to scorn : they shoot out the lip , they shake the head , saying , He trusted on the Lord that he would deliver him : let him deliver him , seeing he delighted in him . '' ( Ps . 22:7-8 . ) _The fulfillment , as Jesus hung on the cross_ , is found in these words : `` The chief priests mocking him , with the scribes and elders , said , He saved others ; himself he can not save . If he be the King of Israel , let him now come down from the cross , and we will believe him . He trusted in God ; let him deliver him now , if he will have him : for he said , I am the Son of God . The thieves also , which were crucified with him , cast the same in his teeth . '' ( Matt . 27:41-44 . ) ( Promised Messiah , pp . 530-531 ) ( emphasis added ) Ps . 22:7-8 reads as follows : `` All they that see me laugh me to scorn : they shoot out the lip , they shake the head , saying , He trusted on the LORD [ Jehovah ] that he would deliver him : let him deliver him , seeing he delighted in him . McConkie said these verses had their fulfillment `` as Jesus hung on the cross . '' That means the person who was scorned in these verses was Christ . Who , then , was the `` LORD '' in whom he trusted ? It was `` Jehovah '' the Father . Another example involves Ps . 31:13 and Ps . 41:9 . Regarding them , McConkie stated the following : `` With reference to the conniving and conspiring plots incident to our Lord 's arrest and judicial trials the prophecy was : `` They took counsel together against me , they devised to take away my life . '' ( Ps . 31:13 . ) As to the role of Judas in those conspiracies , the Psalmist says : `` Mine own familiar friend , in whom I trusted , which did eat of my bread , hath lifted up his heel against me . '' ( Ps . 41:9 . ) ( Promised Messiah , p. 532 ) Apostle McConkie said these Psalms refer to Christ 's `` arrest and judicial trials . '' We shall first consider Ps . 31 and then Ps . 41 . While McConkie only quoted verse 13 of Ps . 31 , verse 14 will also be included to give a complete understanding of the matter . `` For I have heard the slander of many : fear was on every side : while they took counsel together against me , they devised to take away my life . But I trusted in thee , O LORD [ Jehovah ] : I said , Thou art my God [ Elohim ] . ( Ps . 31:13-14 ) McConkie said verse 13 referred to Jesus Christ . Verse 14 goes on to tell that He ( Christ ) trusted in the `` LORD '' who is called His '' God '' or `` Elohim . '' Mormonism teaches that the God above Jesus is '' Elohim '' the Father . Verse 14 , however , reveals that the `` Elohim '' of the man Jesus is `` Jehovah '' the Father . In Ps . 41 , McConkie only quoted one verse ; however , two verses will be considered in this examination . `` Yea , mine own familiar friend , in whom I trusted , which did eat of my bread , hath lifted up his heel against me . But thou , O LORD [ Jehovah ] , be merciful unto me , and raise me up , that I may requite them . ( Ps . 41:9-10 ) McConkie stated above that verse 9 referred to Judas ' role in Christ 's death . Since it was Judas who was the `` familiar friend '' who '' lifted up his heel , '' the pronouns `` mine , '' `` I , '' `` my , '' and `` me '' in verse 9 must refer to Christ . Notice that at the beginning of verse 10 there is a change of pronoun to `` thou , '' which refers to the `` LORD '' ( Jehovah ) . Then the pronouns `` me '' and `` I '' which refer to Christ are used again . That means Christ was speaking to `` Jehovah '' the Father in these verses . Another example involves McConkie 's following remark about Ps . 110:4 . `` One of the great Messianic prophecies , spoken by the mouth of David , says : `` The Lord hath sworn , and will not repent , Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek . '' ( Ps . 110:4 . ) ( Promised Messiah , p. 450 ) McConkie admitted this is a Messianic prophecy involving Christ . The question is , What in this verse refers to Christ ? `` The LORD [ Jehovah ] hath sworn , and will not repent , Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek . ( Ps . 110:4 ) Does the `` LORD , '' which is `` Jehovah , '' refer to Christ ? If McConkie is right and Jesus is `` Jehovah , '' but the Father is not , then the `` LORD '' would have to refer to Christ . But who , then , is the one addressed as the `` priest forever after the order of Melchizedek ? '' The Bible reveals that the one referred to is Jesus Christ ( Heb . 5:8-10 ; 6:20 ; 7 ) ; therefore , the `` LORD '' ( Jehovah ) in Ps . 110:4 is the Father . Another example involves Isa . 53:4-12 . Of these verses McConkie stated : `` Of the atoning sacrifice of the future Messiah , Isaiah said ... The _Lord_ has laid on him the iniquities of us all ... . It pleased the _Lord_ to bruise him ... ( Promised Messiah , p. 234 ) ( emphasis added ) McConkie rightly said these verses refer to `` the atoning sacrifice of the future Messiah . '' However , what he failed to mention is that they also prove that the Father is `` Jehovah . '' Verse 6 reads : `` All we like sheep have gone astray ; we have turned every one to his own way ; and the LORD [ Jehovah ] hath laid on him [ Christ ] the iniquity of us all , '' and verse 10 reads : `` Yet it pleased the LORD [ Jehovah ] to bruise him [ Christ ] ... '' Obviously the `` LORD '' who laid on Christ `` the iniquity of us all '' and who bruised Him is God the Father who is called `` Jehovah '' in these verses . Remember , McConkie stated that `` some sectarians even believe that Jehovah is the Supreme Deity , '' and that Christ `` came into mortality '' as His `` Only Begotten '' Son . He called this concept '' misinformation '' that is `` untrue . '' To prove that it is McConkie who is misinformed and believing untruth , two Scriptural references ( 2 Sam . 7:14 ; Ps . 2:7 ) will be examined . McConkie stated the following regarding these Scriptures : `` In the midst of a passage that is clearly Messianic , the Lord says of the Seed of David : `` I will be his father , and he shall be my son . '' ( 2 Sam . 7:14 . ) In the second Psalm , the whole of which is also clearly Messianic , occurs this statement : `` Thou art my Son ; this day have I begotten thee . '' ( Ps . 2:7 . ) Paul quotes both of these statements in Hebrews 1:5 and says they are prophecies that Christ would come as the Son of God . ( Promised Messiah , p. 143 ) McConkie cited Heb . 1:5 to show that 2 Sam . 7:14 and Ps . 2:7 refer to Christ who `` would come as the Son of God . '' Since McConkie first referenced 2 Sam . 7:14 , this examination will , too . However , along with verse 14 , verses 11-13 will also be included . `` And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel , and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies . Also the LORD [ Jehovah ] telleth thee that he will make thee an house . And when thy days be fulfilled , and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers , I will set up thy seed after thee , which shall proceed out of thy bowels , and I will establish his kingdom . He shall build an house for my name , and I will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever . I will be his father , and he shall be my son . ( 2 Sam . 7:11-14 ) These verses teach that the `` LORD '' ( Jehovah ) would have a Son , the Messiah . In the second example McConkie cited Ps . 2:7 . This examination will include verse 8 . Notice that it is the `` LORD '' ( Jehovah ) who says , '' Thou art my Son ; this day have I begotten thee . '' `` I will declare the decree : the LORD [ Jehovah ] hath said unto me , Thou art my Son ; this day have I begotten thee . Ask of me , and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance , and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession . McConkie said these verses of Scripture are `` clearly Messianic , '' and he acknowledged they teach that `` Christ would come as the Son of God . '' What he is not willing to acknowledge , however , is that these Scriptures also teach that the Father is `` Jehovah '' and that the '' sectarians '' who believe `` Jehovah is the Supreme Deity whose Son '' is Jesus Christ , `` the Only Begotten , '' are right in their belief . Another example involves Mic . 5:4 . Of this verse McConkie stated the following : `` And so , truly , did our Lord act _during his mortal ministry ! Truly , this is he of whom it is written_ : `` He shall stand and feed in the strength of the Lord , in the majesty of the name of the LORD his God ... for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth . '' ( Mic . 5:4 . ) ( Promised Messiah , p. 182 ) ( emphasis added ) According to McConkie , the pronoun `` He '' at the beginning of Mic . 5:4 refers to Christ `` during his mortal ministry . '' Who , then , is the '' LORD his God ? '' Mic . 5:4 reads : `` And he [ Christ ] shall stand and feed in the strength of the LORD [ Jehovah ] , in the majesty of the name of the LORD [ Jehovah ] his God [ Elohim ] ... for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth . Obviously the `` LORD '' of Jesus Christ is `` Jehovah '' the Father who is referred to as `` Jehovah his Elohim . '' Another example involves Ps . 2:2 and Isa . 61:1 . Of these verses McConkie stated the following : `` A number of Messianic passages speak of `` the Lord , and ... his anointed '' ( Ps . 2:2 ) , signifying that the Chosen One was consecrated and set apart for the ministry and mission that was his . _Jesus applied these passages to himself_ by quoting Isaiah 's prophecy . `` The Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek '' ( Isa . 61:1 ) , and then saying : `` This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears '' ( Luke 4:21 ) . ( Promised Messiah , pp . 182-183 ) ( emphasis added ) The first source McConkie quoted -- Ps . 2:2 -- reads as follows : `` The kings of the earth set themselves , and the rulers take counsel together , against the LORD [ Jehovah ] , and against his anointed . McConkie said the `` anointed '' one was Christ . If that is true , who was `` Jehovah ? '' If `` Jehovah '' is always Christ , who was the `` anointed '' one ? Obviously `` Jehovah '' is referring to God the Father and the '' anointed '' is indeed referring to Christ . The second source McConkie cited is Isa . 61:1 which states : `` The Spirit of the Lord [ Adonai ] GOD [ Jehovah ] is upon me ; because the LORD [ Jehovah ] hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek ; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted , to proclaim liberty to the captives , and the opening of the prison to them that are bound ; The one who was anointed to preach , bind up , proclaim , and open was Jesus Christ . Who , then , was the one who anointed Him ? This verse says the `` LORD '' ( Jehovah ) did the anointing . Again , we face the same problem . If `` Jehovah '' does not refer to the Father , but only to Christ , then Jesus anointed someone , but who ? As McConkie pointed out , `` Jesus applied these passages to himself . '' Therefore , the `` Jehovah '' who anointed Christ is God the Father . Other examples could be cited to show that McConkie and other Mormon leaders are wrong when they say God the Father is not `` Jehovah . '' However , these should be enough to expose their error . Now , what about Mormonism 's claim that Jesus is `` Jehovah , '' but He is not `` Elohim ? '' It is true that Jesus is `` Jehovah . '' The following Scriptures prove this fact : `` Thus saith the LORD [ Jehovah ] the King of Israel , and his redeemer the LORD [ Jehovah ] of hosts ; I am the first , and I am the last ; and beside me there is no God . ( Isa . 44:6 ) [ Jesus said ] ... I am the first and the last : I am he that liveth , and was dead ... ( Rev . 1:17-18 ) `` ... saith the LORD [ Jehovah ] ... they shall look upon me whom they have pierced , and they shall mourn for him , as one mourneth for his only son ... ( Zech . 12:1,10 ) Behold , he [ Christ ] cometh with clouds ; and every eye shall see him , and they also which pierced him ... ( Rev . 1:7 ) `` ... I am the LORD [ Jehovah ] thy God , the Holy One of Israel ... ( Isa . 43:3 ) ... Ye denied the Holy One [ Christ ] and the Just ... ( Acts 3:14 ) `` And it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the LORD [ Jehovah ] shall be delivered ... ( Joel 2:32 ) `` ... the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth ... there is none other name under heaven given among men , whereby we must be saved . ( Acts 4:10,12 ) `` Behold , the Lord GOD [ Jehovah ] will come with strong hand ... his reward is with him ... ( Isa . 40:10 ) ... Behold , I [ Christ ] come quickly ; and my reward is with me ... ( Rev . 22:12 ) `` ... the LORD [ Jehovah ] my God shall come , and all the saints with thee . ( Zech . 14:5 ) `` ... at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints . ( 1 Thess . 3:13 ) `` The LORD [ Jehovah ] is my shepherd ... ( Ps . 23:1 ) [ Jesus said ] I am the good shepherd ... ( John 10:14 ) `` ... saith the Lord GOD [ Jehovah ] . I will seek that which was lost ... ( Ezek . 34:15-16 ) ... the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost . ( Luke 19:10 ) `` For I am the LORD [ Jehovah ] thy God , the Holy One of Israel , thy Saviour ... ( Isa . 43:3 ) Looking for that blessed hope , and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ . ( Tit . 2:13 . See also Jer . 42:5 and Rev . 1:5 ; Mal . 3:6 and Heb . 13:8 ; 1 Kin . 8:28,39 and John 2:24-25 ; Isa . 25:8 and 2 Tim . 1:10 ; Ps . 107:24,29 and Matt . 8:26 ; Prov.3:12 and Rev . 3:19 ) While Mormons are right when they say Jesus is `` Jehovah , '' they are wrong when they say He is not `` Elohim . '' The Bible reveals that '' Jehovah '' is the only true `` Elohim '' there is ; all others are false . Remember , `` Jehovah '' is the personal name of the triune God who has revealed Himself in the Bible . Before we consider Biblical quotes which show that `` Jehovah '' and '' Elohim '' are not two separate gods as Mormons claims let us first note that not only are both God the Father and Christ addressed as `` Jehovah '' and `` Elohim '' but so is the Holy Spirit . `` Whereof the _Holy Ghost_ ... _said_ ... This _is_ the covenant that I will make with them after those days , saith the Lord , I will put my laws into their hearts , and in their minds will I write them ; And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more . ( Heb . 10:15-17 ) ( emphasis on `` Holy Ghost '' and `` said '' added ) Behold , the days come , _saith the LORD_ [ Jehovah ] , that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel , and with the house of Judah ... I will put my law in their inward parts , and write it in their hearts ; and will be their God [ Elohim ] , and they shall be my people ... . I will forgive their iniquity , and I will remember their sin no more . ( Jer . 31:31,33-34 ) ( emphasis added ) `` For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man : but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the _Holy Ghost_ . ( 2 Pet . 1:21 ) ( emphasis on `` Holy Ghost '' added ) `` The Spirit of the LORD [ Jehovah ] spake by me , and his word was in my tongue . ( 2 Sam . 23:2 . See also Heb . 3:7-11 with Ps . 95:6-11 ) Let us now continue with the Biblical quotes which show that '' Jehovah '' and `` Elohim '' are not two separate gods as Mormons claim . `` And when the LORD [ Jehovah ] saw that he [ Moses ] turned aside to see , God [ Elohim ] called unto him out of the midst of the bush , and said , Moses , Moses . And he said , Here am I ... . [ Bruce R. McConkie acknowledged that `` it was '' Christ 's `` voice that spoke to Moses in the burning bush ... '' Promised Messiah , p. 394 ] And the LORD [ Jehovah ] said ... And Moses said unto God [ Elohim ] , Behold , when I come unto the children of Israel , and shall say unto them , The God [ Elohim ] of your fathers hath sent me unto you ; and they shall say to me , What is his name ? what shall I say unto them ? And God [ Elohim ] said unto Moses , I AM THAT I AM : and he said , Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel , I AM hath sent me unto you . And God [ Elohim ] said moreover unto Moses , Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel , the LORD [ Jehovah ] God [ Elohim ] of your fathers , the God [ Elohim ] of Abraham , the God [ Elohim ] of Isaac , and the God [ Elohim ] of Jacob , hath sent me unto you : this is my name for ever , and this is my memorial unto all generations . ( Exod . 3:4,7,13-15 ) `` And God [ Elohim ] spake unto Moses , and said unto him , I am the LORD [ Jehovah ] . ( Exod . 6:2 ) `` I am the LORD [ Jehovah ] , and there is none else , there is no God [ Elohim ] beside me : I girded thee , though thou hast not known me : ( Isa . 45:5 ) `` But the LORD [ Jehovah ] is the true God [ Elohim ] , he is the living God [ Elohim ] , and an everlasting king ... ( Jer . 10:10 ) `` Thus saith the LORD [ Jehovah ] the King of Israel , and his redeemer the LORD [ Jehovah ] of hosts ; I am the first , and I am the last ; and beside me there is no God [ Elohim ] . ( Isa . 44:6 ) `` Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus , saith the LORD [ Jehovah ] , whose name is The God [ Elohim ] of hosts . ( Amos 5:27 ) `` Behold , the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the LORD's [ Jehovah 's ] thy God [ Elohim ] , the earth also , with all that therein is . ( Deut . 10:14 ) `` Wherefore thou art great , O LORD [ Jehovah ] God [ Elohim ] : for there is none like thee , neither is there any God [ Elohim ] beside thee , according to all that we have heard with our ears . ( 2 Sam . 7:22 ) `` And he said unto them , I am an Hebrew ; and I fear the LORD [ Jehovah ] , the God [ Elohim ] of heaven , which hath made the sea and the dry land . ( Jon . 1:9 ) `` For who is God [ Elohim ] save the LORD [ Jehovah ] ? or who is a rock save our God [ Elohim ] ? ( Ps . 18:31 ) `` Blessed is the nation whose God [ Elohim ] is the LORD [ Jehovah ] ... ( Ps . 33:12 . See also Ps . 144:15 ) `` Hast thou not known ? hast thou not heard , that the everlasting God [ Elohim ] , the LORD [ Jehovah ] , the Creator of the ends of the earth , fainteth not , neither is weary ? there is no searching of his understanding . ( Isa . 40:28 ) `` The mighty God [ Elohim ] , even the LORD [ Jehovah ] , hath spoken , and called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof . ( Ps . 50:1 ) `` Sing unto God [ Elohim ] , sing praises to his name : estol him that rideth upon the heavens by his name JAH , and rejoice before him . ( Ps . 68:4 ) [ Regarding the word `` Jah , '' Bruce R. McConkie stated : `` Jah ( Hebrew Yah ) is a contracted form of Jehovah , Jahveh , or Yahweh -- all of which names have reference to Christ , the God of Israel . '' Mormon Doctrine , p. 391 ] `` And David arose , and went with all the people that were with him from Baale of Judah , to bring up from thence the ark of God [ Elohim ] , whose name is called by the name of the LORD [ Jehovah ] of hosts that dwelleth between the cherubims . ( 2 Sam . 6:2 ) `` ... the Great the Mighty God [ Elohim ] , the LORD [ Jehovah ] of hosts , is his name . ( Jer . 32:18 ) `` O my God [ Elohim ] , make them like a wheel ; as the stubble before the wind ... . Fill their faces with shame ; that they may seek thy name , O LORD [ Jehovah ] ... . That men may know that thou , whose name alone is JEHOVAH , art the most high over all the earth . ( Ps . 83:13,16,18 ) The Bible clearly teaches that `` Jehovah '' is `` Elohim . '' In fact , He is the only `` Elohim '' there is . He is the `` true , '' the `` living , '' the '' mighty , '' the `` great , '' and the `` everlasting Elohim . '' He is the `` Elohim '' of Israel , of all the kingdoms of the earth , and of the heavens . He is the Creator who made the heavens and all their host and the earth and all that dwell thereon . `` Jehovah 's '' name is `` Elohim of hosts . '' ( Amos 5:27 ) Not only is `` Jehovah , '' `` Elohim , '' but `` Elohim '' is `` Jehovah . '' The Bible reveals that `` Elohim 's '' name is `` Jah '' ( Ps . 68:4 ) , `` Jehovah '' ( Ps . 83:18 ) , and `` Jehovah of hosts . '' ( 2 Sam . 6:2 ; Jer . 32:18 ) The nation whose `` Elohim '' is `` Jehovah '' is blessed . ( Ps . 33:12 ) Clearly , this is not the `` Jehovah '' and `` Elohim '' of the Mormons . Another Mormon error regarding `` Elohim '' and `` Jehovah '' is the belief that `` Elohim , '' not `` Jehovah , '' is the Father of all the spirits , including Jesus . In the Articles of Faith by Apostle James E. Talmage , '' A Doctrinal Exposition by The First Presidency and The Twelve '' apostles states that `` God the Eternal Father ... 'Elohim , ' is the literal Parent of ... the spirits of the human race . '' ( p. 466 ) This `` Doctrinal Exposition '' also states explicitly that `` Jesus Christ is not the Father of the spirits who have taken or yet shall take bodies upon this earth , for He is one of them . He is The Son , as they are sons and daughters of Elohim . '' ( p. 473 ) The Apostle Talmage stated that `` _Elohim_ ... is the name-title of God the Eternal Father , whose firstborn Son in the spirit is _Jehovah_ -- '' ( Jesus the Christ , p. 38 ) The Apostle Bruce R. McConkie stated the following about this matter : `` ... Jehovah-Christ ... did in fact create the earth and all forms of plant and animal life on the face thereof . _But when it came to placing man on earth , there was a change in Creators_ . That is , the Father himself became personally involved . All things were created by the Son , using the power delegated by the Father , except man . _In the spirit and again in the flesh , man was created by the Father_ . There was no delegation of authority where the crowning creature of creation was concerned . '' ( Promised Messiah , p. 62 ) ( emphasis added ) Mormon leaders claim that `` Jehovah-Christ '' did not create either man 's spirit or his body . They maintain that the Mormon `` Elohim , '' who is the father , created man both in spirit and body . The Bible reveals the truth about who created man . `` And Moses spake unto the LORD [ Jehovah ] , saying , Let the LORD [ Jehovah ] , the God [ Elohim ] of the _spirits of all flesh_ , set a man over the congregation . ( Num . 27:15-16 . See also 16:20-23 ) ( emphasis added ) `` ... the LORD [ Jehovah ] , which stretcheth forth the heavens , and layeth the foundation of the earth , and _formeth the spirit of man within him_ . ( Zech . 12:1 ) ( emphasis added ) `` ... the LORD [ Jehovah ] ... made us this soul ... ( Jer . 38:16 ) `` For I will not contend for ever , neither will I be always wroth : for the spirit should fail before me , and the _souls which I have made_ ... . ... saith the LORD [ Jehovah ] ... ( Isa . 57:16,19 ) ( emphasis on `` souls ... I have made '' added ) `` Behold , I am the LORD [ Jehovah ] , the God [ Elohim ] _of all flesh_ ... ( Jer . 32:27 ) ( emphasis added ) `` Thus saith the LORD [ Jehovah ] , thy redeemer , and he that _formed thee from the womb_ . I am the LORD [ Jehovah ] that maketh all things ... ( Isa . 44:24 ) ( emphasis added ) `` Thus saith the LORD [ Jehovah ] ... I have made the earth , and _created man_ upon it ... ( Isa . 45:11-12 ) ( emphasis added ) `` ... God [ Elohim ] created man upon the earth ... Unto thee it was shewed , that thou mightest know that the LORD [ Jehovah ] he is God [ Elohim ] ; there is none else beside him . ( Deut . 4:32,35 ) `` Thus saith God [ El ] the LORD [ Jehovah ] ... he that spread forth the earth , and that which cometh out of it ; he that giveth breath unto the people upon it , and spirit to them that walk therein . ( Isa . 42:5 ) `` ... Thus saith the LORD [ Jehovah ] of hosts , the God [ Elohim ] of Israel ... I have made the earth , _the man_ and the beast that are upon the ground ... ( Jer . 27:4-5 ) ( most emphasis added ) The Bible reveals that it is `` Jehovah '' who is the `` Elohim of the spirits of all flesh '' and `` of all flesh '' itself , that it was He who '' formed the spirit of man within him , '' that He `` made us this soul '' and '' formed us from the womb . '' He did indeed `` create man . '' If Mormon leaders are right when they say Jesus is `` Jehovah , '' then they are wrong when they say he did not create man . If they are right when they say the father is the one who created man , then they are wrong when they say he is not `` Jehovah . '' Although Mormon leaders teach that Jesus did not create man , Mormon scriptures teach that he did . The BoM states the following : `` Behold , I am Jesus Christ . I am the Father and the Son ... . And never have I showed myself unto _man whom I have created_ , for never has man believed in me as thou hast ... . Behold , this body , which ye now behold , is the body of my spirit ; and _man have I created_ after the body of my spirit ... ( Eth . 3:14-16 ) ( emphasis added ) `` For it is I that taketh upon me the sins of the world ; for it is _I that hath created them_ ... ( Mos . 26:23 ) ( emphasis added ) `` ... the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ... is that same God who created the heavens and the earth , and all things that in them are . Behold _he created Adam_ ... ( Mor . 9:11-12 ) ( emphasis added ) D & C , 93:10 states that `` the worlds were made by him [ Christ ] ; _men were made by him_ ; all things were made by him , and through him , and of him . '' ( emphasis added ) Another error by Bruce R. McConkie involving `` Jehovah '' and his creation is the belief that `` Jehovah '' had `` many '' pre-mortal spirits helping him create . Included in this alleged group was Joseph Smith , Jr. `` That he [ Christ ] was aided in the creation of this earth by `` many of the noble and great '' spirit children of the Father is evident from Abraham 's writings . Unto those superior spirits Christ said : `` We will go down , for there is space there , and we will take of these materials , and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell . '' ( Abra . 3:22-24 . ) Michael or Adam was one of these . Enoch , Noah , Abraham , Moses , Peter , James , and John , Joseph Smith , and many other `` noble and great '' ones played a part in the great creative enterprise . ( Doctrines of Salvation , vol . 1 , pp . 74-75 . ) ( Mormon Doctrine , p. 169 ) The Bible reveals the truth about this matter : `` Thus saith the LORD [ Jehovah ] , thy redeemer , and he that formed thee from the womb , I am the LORD [ Jehovah ] that maketh all things ; that stretcheth forth the heavens alone ; that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself . ( Isa . 44:24 ) `` Which alone spreadeth out the heavens , and treadeth upon the waves of the sea . ( Job 9:8 ) `` Jehovah , '' by Himself , created all things . He had no alleged preexistent spirit helpers assisting Him . Regarding the Mormon 'Elohim , '' the Apostle McConkie stated : '' Elohim . plural word though it is , is also used as the exalted name-title of God the Eternal Father , a usage that connotes his supremacy and omnipotence , he being God above all Gods . '' ( Mormon Doctrine , p. 224 ) He also stated that `` Jesus ... is above all save the Father only . '' ( Promised Messiah , p. 363 ) The Bible states that the One who is God above all so-called gods is the triune God `` Jehovah . '' `` For the LORD [ Jehovah ] is a great God [ El ] , and a great King above all gods [ Elohim ] . ( Ps . 95:3 ) `` For thou , LORD [ Jehovah ] , art high above all the earth : thou art exalted far above all gods [ Elohim ] . ( Ps . 97:9 ) `` Now I know that the LORD [ Jehovah ] is greater than all gods [ Elohim ] ... ( Exod . 18:11 . See also Ps . 135:5 ; Deut . 10:17 ) If Mormon leaders are right when they say `` Jehovah '' is god the son and `` Elohim '' is god the father , these verses from the Bible would be teaching that the Mormon son is above his father . However , as McConkie clearly stated , Mormons believe `` Elohim '' the father , not `` Jehovah '' the son , is the `` God above all Gods '' -- that Jesus is above all except the father ; yet the Bible teaches that `` Jehovah '' is above all `` Elohim . '' At a BYU Dev . on March 2 , 1982 , Bruce R. McConkie made the following remark about praying to Jesus : `` Another peril is that those so involved often begin to pray directly to Christ because of some special friendship they feel has been developed ... . This is plain sectarian nonsense . Our prayers are addressed to the Father , and to him only ... . ... Perfect prayer is addressed to the Father , in the name of the Son ; it is uttered by the power of the Holy Ghost ... ( Our Relationship With the Lord , pp . 19-20 ) McConkie states on p. 335 of his book Promised Messiah that the Mormons `` pray to the Father , not the Son ... '' On p. 306 of the same book McConkie states that `` Christ [ the Son ] is Jehovah . '' This is important to remember , because although McConkie said prayer is not to be offered to the Mormon Christ who is `` Jehovah , '' the Bible states repeatedly in the OT that people prayed to `` Jehovah , '' and He not only heard those prayers , but He accepted them as valid requests . The following is but a small sample of the vast number of times people prayed to `` Jehovah . '' `` In my distress I called upon the LORD [ Jehovah ] , and cried unto my God [ Elohim ] : he heard my voice out of his temple , and my cry came before him , even into his ears . ( Ps . 18:6 ) `` And the LORD [ Jehovah ] said unto him , I have heard thy prayer and thy supplication , that thou hast made before me : I have hallowed this house , which thou hast built , to put my name there for ever ; and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually . ( 1 Kin . 9:3 ) `` And said unto Jeremiah the prophet , Let , we beseech thee , our supplication be accepted before thee , and pray for us unto the LORD [ Jehovah ] thy God [ Elohim ] , even for all this remnant ... ( Jer . 42:2 ) `` O LORD [ Jehovah ] , I beseech thee , let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant , and to the prayer of thy servants , who desire to fear thy name ... ( Neh . 1:11 ) `` And it was so , that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the LORD [ Jehovah ] , he arose from before the altar of the LORD [ Jehovah ] , from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to heaven . ( 1 Kin . 8:54 ) `` He went in therefore , and shut the door upon them twain , and prayed unto the LORD [ Jehovah ] . ( 2 Kin . 4:33 ) `` Go , and say to Hezekiah , Thus saith the LORD [ Jehovah ] , the God [ Elohim ] of David thy father , I have heard thy prayer , I have seen thy tears : behold , I will add unto thy days fifteen years . ( Isa . 38:5 ) `` I acknowledge my sin unto thee , and mine iniquity have I not hid . I said , I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD [ Jehovah ] ; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin . For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found ... ( Ps . 32:5-6 ) Notice above in Ps . 32:6 that the `` godly '' pray to `` Jehovah . '' According to McConkie and other Mormon leaders , that is Christ the very one to whom McConkie said people should not pray . The Bible reveals there is only one true `` Elohim , '' and His name is `` Jehovah . '' All other `` Elohim '' are false . They are idols that cause their followers to commit adultery against the true `` Elohim '' and idolatry . `` For the LORD [ Jehovah ] is great , and greatly to be praised : he is to be feared above all gods [ Elohim ] . For all the gods [ Elohim ] of the nations are idols : but the LORD [ Jehovah ] made the heavens . ( Ps . 96:4-5 ) `` Thou shalt have no other gods [ Elohim ] before me . ( Exod . 20:3 ) `` Now I know that the LORD [ Jehovah ] is greater than all gods [ Elohim ] ... ( Exod . 18:11 ) `` And it shall be , if thou do at all forget the LORD [ Jehovah ] thy God [ Elohim ] , and walk after other gods [ Elohim ] , and serve them , and worship them , I testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish . ( Deut . 8:19 ) `` Thou shalt make no covenant with them , nor with their gods [ Elohim ] . They shall not dwell in thy land , lest they make thee sin against me : for if thou serve their gods [ Elohim ] , it will surely be a snare unto thee . ( Exod . 23:32- 33 ) `` Take heed to yourselves , that your heart be not deceived , and ye turn aside , and serve other gods [ Elohim ] , and worship them . ( Deut . 11:16 ) `` That ye come not among these nations , these that remain among you ; neither make mention of the name of their gods [ Elohim ] , nor cause to swear by them , neither serve them , nor bow yourselves unto them . ( Josh . 23:7 ) `` ... neither walk after other gods [ Elohim ] to your hurt . ( Jer . 7:6 ) `` But the LORD [ Jehovah ] is the true God [ Elohim ] , he is the living God [ Elohim ] ... ( Jer . 10:10 ) `` And they forsook the LORD [ Jehovah ] God [ Elohim ] of their fathers , which brought them out of the land of Egypt , and followed other gods [ Elohim ] , of the gods [ Elohim ] of the people that were round about them , and bowed themselves unto them , and provoked the LORD [ Jehovah ] to anger . ( Jud . 2:12 ) `` Shall a man make gods [ Elohim ] unto himself , and they are no gods [ Elohim ] ? Therefore , behold , I will this once cause them to know , I will cause them to know mine hand and my might ; and they shall know that my name is the LORD [ Jehovah ] . ( Jer . 16:20-21 ) `` And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD [ Jehovah ] , choose you this day whom ye will serve ; whether the gods [ Elohim ] which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood , or the gods [ Elohim ] of the Amorites , in whose land ye dwell : but as for me and my house , we will serve the LORD [ Jehovah ] . And the people answered and said , God [ Elohim ] forbid that we should forsake the LORD [ Jehovah ] , to serve other gods [ Elohim ] . ( Josh . 24:15-16 ) These verses teach that the only true , living `` Elohim '' in heaven and on earth is `` Jehovah '' -- the triune God who made heaven and earth and all therein . `` Jehovah '' is greater than any `` Elohim , '' because all other '' Elohim '' are idols . The reality behind them is demonic . ( Deut . 32:17 ) '' Jehovah Elohim '' has given explicit warnings and guidelines regarding these false `` Elohim . '' He told His people not to have any `` Elohim '' but Him . He told the people that if they left Him for the false `` Elohim , '' those `` Elohim '' would be a snare to them , and they would be hurt and would perish . He warned the people to `` take heed '' that their `` heart be not deceived '' into worshiping , serving , swearing by , and making covenants with false `` Elohim . '' `` Jehovah Elohim '' told His people He would eventually judge all false `` Elohim '' and their followers . Despite these warnings and guidelines , `` Elohim 's '' covenant people forsook Him and believed in and worshiped the false `` Elohim 's '' of the people they came in contact with . Ju . 10:6 states that `` the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD [ Jehovah ] and served Baalim , and Ashtaroth , and the gods [ Elohim ] of Syria , and the gods [ Elohim ] of Zidon , and the gods [ Elohim ] of Moab , and the gods [ Elohim ] of the children of Ammon , and the gods [ Elohim ] of the Philistines , and forsook the LORD [ Jehovah ] , and served not him . '' This examination has shown that the `` Elohim '' of Mormonism , like the `` Elohim '' in Ju . 10:6 is not the true `` Jehovah Elohim . '' Therefore , the people who leave the true `` Elohim '' for the Mormon `` Elohim '' will do '' evil ... in the sight of the LORD [ Jehovah ] . '' Although McConkie attacked Christians for their belief in a triune God who is Spirit and for their belief that God the Father [ Jehovah ] sent His Son into the world , these beliefs are true . God is triune ; He is Spirit ; He is `` Jehovah ; '' and He did send His Son into the world to redeem mankind . It is obvious from this examination that it is not the Christians who `` thrash around in ... darkness '' about who `` Elohim '' and '' Jehovah '' are . One wonders what `` Holy Writ '' McConkie had in mind when he stated that it attests to the fact that `` Elohim is the Father , and that Jehovah is the Son . '' He certainly did not mean the Bible which teaches that the Father , Son , and Holy Spirit are all the one `` Jehovah Elohim . '' He apparently did not mean the D & C either , because chapter 109 , verses 1,4,9-10 , 14,19,22,24,29,34,42,47,56,68,77 refer to the Father as '' Jehovah . '' Summary Obviously Joseph Fielding Smith 's statement that the Mormons '' have a clear and perfect understanding of the nature of God '' ( Doctrines of Salvation , 1:279 ) is not accurate . The Mormon gods are not the true God as Mormonism claims , but are idols which cause their followers to commit adultery against God and idolatry . In answer to Jesus ' question , `` But whom say ye that I am , '' Mormons say Jesus is someone different from the Jesus who is revealed in the Bible and whom the apostles preached . Therefore , anyone trusting in the Mormon Jesus is believing in `` another Jesus '' whom Paul warned about . Bernard P. Brockbank , of the First Quorum of the Seventy , admitted in the May 1977 issue of The Ensign , a Mormon publication , that the Mormon Jesus is different from the Christian Jesus . He stated that '' it is true that many of the Christian churches worship a different Jesus Christ than is worshipped by the Mormons or The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints . '' ( p. 26 ) The people who believe in the Mormon Jesus are committing adultery against God and idolatry . They do not have the Son ; therefore , they do not have the Father , and they do not have eternal life . As the Apostle Bruce R. McConkie rightly stated : `` Salvation comes only by worshiping the true God . '' ( Promised Messiah , p. 163 ) McConkie also rightly stated that `` the mere worship of a god who has the proper scriptural names does not assure one that he is worshiping the true and living God , '' because the `` true names of Deity '' can be applied to `` false concepts of God . '' ( Mormon Doctrine , p. 270 ) Remember that the Apostle Stephen L. Richards admitted that Joseph Smith , Jr. , gave `` a new conception of God and the Godhead . '' ( Contributions of Joseph Smith , p. 1 ) It is important for the people who have left the true triune God revealed in the Bible to repent and return to Him . They must forsake the sins of idolatry and adultery which they are committing in Mormonism . The Bible says : `` ... all that forsake thee shall be ashamed , and they that depart from me shall be written in the earth , because they have forsaken the LORD [ Jehovah ] , the fountain of living waters . ( Jer . 17:13 ) `` And it shall be , if thou do at all forget the LORD [ Jehovah ] thy God [ Elohim ] , and walk after other gods [ Elohim ] , and serve them , and worship them , I testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish . ( Deut . 8:19 ) `` Thou shalt make no covenant with ... their gods [ Elohim ] . ( Exod . 23:32 ) `` ... Put away the strange gods [ Elohim ] that are among you , and be clean , and change your garments . ( Gen. 35:2 ) `` ... flee from idolatry . ( 1 Cor . 10:14 ) It is necessary that Christians heed the warnings of the Bible . If they do , they will not fall into the sins of adultery against God and idolatry . Remember , to know the `` only true God '' is eternal life . ( John 17:3 ) `` ... their gods [ Elohim ] shall be a snare unto you . '' ( Ju . 2:3 . See also Exod . 23:32-33 )

Subject : Re-entrancy of Xlib functions . Known problem ? ? ? From : visser @ eedwsa.itwol.bhp.com.au ( Martin Visser ) Distribution : world Nntp-Posting-Host : eedwsa.itwol.bhp.com.au Lines : 27 I 've found a problem in the use of Xlib functions regarding re-entrancy . I decided to implement an animated cursor ( using 6 created cursors ) by calling XDefineCursor from a SIG_ALRM signal handler . This is used to indicate we are waiting for a operator request to complete . ( on a production control system ) . I was redrawing the screen underneath the animated cursor and then restoring the standard cursor when complete . I found dumped core , and upon analysis it was when the SIG_ALRM handler was called during a XDrawString call . XDrawString was doing a bcopy ( presumably an internal structure ) when the XDefineCursor was called . Presumably the ( internal ) structure that XDrawString was manipulating was not in a stable state and sent XDefineCursor to where it should n't have been . Has anyone else experienced this ? Is there any official documentation that says you should ensure this does n't happen ? Or should bcopy ( ) be atomic .

There are two things at work here ... the public insurance is very wide in what it will cover , as the amortization is also universal .

But that only for insurance ... and you ca n't force a private insurance company to sell you a plan that they will not offer . And remember that the actual health care is delivered by private entities who collect from the public insurance voluntarily . Again , they ca n't force a private entity to spring to life to pay them . Plus , there is the matter of culture and values ... I 'm basically anti-tax and anti-government , by Canadian standards ... yet I can't bring myself to make the same arguments as you do , despite that I understand where you 're coming from . Up north , you 're so much more likely to find someone protesting taxes going to defence than health insurance premiums to only one fund for basic coverage ... > > > ( Interesting side note-have any new insurance companies started > > > up-from scratch-since Medicare became standard in Canada ? > > > > I actually have doubts that any new ones have emerged since WW I ... > > no , scratch that ... there are a few in Western Canada , and *quite* > > a few in Quebec as part of the post-1980 Quebec Miracle ( out with the > > nationalism , in with the French capitalism ) .

Does n't > Canada have something like ten times the proportion of GPs to specialists > that the US does ? Yes , but part of the reason is that our most of our markets are too small to sustain many specialists , sometimes not even one , so you pretty well have to be a GP to get paid . And if you do get the training , the doctors monopoly might block your getting of a licence because there is already someone in the business and who can not fill his/her appointment book . That we have a CMA doctors monopoly is something that the American AMA-oriented medical lobby NEVER tells you down here ... > The problem is , in a specialty your skill often directly correlates > to your pay ( a good cardiologist makes more than a merely adequate > cardiologist ) more than it does in general practice . In that > circumstance , it 's hard to blame people for going into specialties . No , I respect people who do specialties ( okay , all of my MD friends are ( - ; ) but there 's the question of our small market dynamics up north ... if anything , that our private doctors and hospitals sell their services to Americans to generate more business will inflate their effective population served , and thus make some specialties finally viable ( i.e. , there will be enough customers ) . We just do not have enough sick Canadians in absolute numbers otherwise . > I personally think an approach like Germany 's would be best-where the > companies compete for batches of people . Rochester , a little east of > us , was able to get almost all of its population covered that way . Uh ... Germany basically uses our method , with their many sickness funds . The competition is fake if it exists at all , because they're all interlinked . Look in Der Spiegel or Stern ( my girlfriend is in our German department and her uncle is a private practicioner in Saarbrucken ) ... no ads for health insurance . While Canada organizes by province , Germany organizes the paperwork around big corporations and regional offices . But remember that we have provinces that have the same population as some major German corporations . Germans have public health insurance , just that it is brokered by smaller entities ( actually , brokerage of basic by private firms who 'll sell extra insurance to fill out their policies , sort of a voucher system , was one of the first ideas floated in Canada , too ) . Remember , the Germans do n't have HMO 's ... a telling sign , 'cos Rochester does and they 're also a company town . > But there was a Washington Post article recently about that that said > Canadian doctors often use myelograms instead of MRIs , which require > spinal injections and can cause seizures and headaches . Mickey Kaus , > in the New Republic , probably spoke for most Americans when he said > '' Who needs that ? '' I think people here generally like to believe they > can easily get the most high-tech treatment even if they really can't > afford it . I 'll have to let a Canadian MD jump in to verify that claim , but I 've come to learn to suspect anything in the American press about our `` system '' . If much or some of it were true , you 'd have to take us for idiots for tolerating it . And given that our insurance was installed during a period when there were only Liberal and Tory governments federally and provincially , and the socialists are still chafing , they would 've pressed for real socialized medicine to fix things ... think about it . After all , we are using the U.S. as a metric to make comparison ... both for keeping-up-with-the-Joneses as for confirming that we did something right . gld -- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Je me souviens ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Gary L.

The 10,000 who were allowed to remain were confined to a territory of 40,000 hectares in a region were annual mean precipiation was 150 mm - a quantity low enough to ensure a crop failure two years out of three . The rare water wells in the south and central Negev , spring of life in the desert , were cemented to prevent Bedouin shepherds from roaming . A few Bedouin shepherds were allowed to stay in the central Negev . But after 1982 , when the Sinai was returned to Egypt , these Bedouin were also eliminated . At the same time , strong pressure was applied on the Bedouin to abandon cultivation of their fields in order that the land could be transferred to the army . And now you say noone knows anything about what happened there : No reliable statistics exist concerning the amount of land held today by Negev Bedouin . It is a known fact that a large part of the 40,000 hectares they cultivated in the 1950s has been seized by the Israeli authorities . Indeed , most of the Bedouin are now confined to seven `` development towns '' , or *sowetos* , established for them . ( the rest of the article is available from Elias Davidsson , email : elias @ ismennt.is ) So what you basically say is that `` we know for sure that nothing good happens there now , we know for sure that the beduins prospered before the Jews arrived and that they were driven away by the Jews , noone on earth knows about what the Jews did there .

Feel free to email questions or further comments . -- Burt Kaliski RSA Laboratories -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- \documentstyle [ 12pt ] { article } \begin { document } \title { On `` Pseudocollisions '' in the MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm } \author { Burton S. Kaliski Jr. \\ { \tt burt @ rsa.com } \and Matthew J.B. Robshaw \\ { \tt matt @ rsa.com } \and RSA Laboratories \\ 100 Marine Parkway \\ Redwood City , CA 94065 } \date { April 23 , 1993 } \maketitle A message-digest algorithm maps a message of arbitrary length to a `` digest '' of fixed length , and has three properties : Computing the digest is easy , finding a message with a given digest -- - `` inversion '' -- -is hard , and finding two messages with the same digest -- - `` collision '' -- -is also hard . Message-digest algorithms have many applications , including digital signatures and message authentication . RSA Data Security 's MD5 message-digest algorithm , developed by Ron Rivest \cite { rfc-md5 } , maps a message to a 128-bit message digest . Computing the digest of a one-megabyte message takes as little as a second . While no message-digest algorithm can yet be { \em proved } secure , MD5 is believed to be at least as good as any other that maps to a 128-bit digest . Inversion should take about $ 2^ { 128 } $ operations , and collision should take about $ 2^ { 64 } $ operations . No one has found a faster approach to inversion or collision . Recent work by den Boer and Bosselaers \cite { den-boer-md5 } presents a special kind of `` pseudocollision '' in MD5's internal compression function , which maps a 512-bit message block $ x $ and a 128-bit input state $ s $ to a 128-bit output state . They show how to find a message block $ x $ and two related input states $ s_1 $ and $ s_2 $ that yield the same output state : $ f ( x , s_1 ) $ = $ f ( x , s_2 ) $ . Their well-thought approach exploits structural properties of the collision function to find a pseudocollision in about $ 2^ { 16 } $ operations , much less than one would expect . Practical implications of this pseudocollision work to the security of MD5 are not evident . While a real collision in MD5 implies a pseudocollision ( or a `` pseudo-inversion '' ) , a pseudocollision need not imply a real collision . Indeed , a real collision , since it involves two different messages , would almost always involve { \em different } message blocks $ x_1 $ and $ x_2 $ such that $ f ( x_1 , s_1 ) = f ( x_2 , s_2 ) $ , but the pseudocollisions have the same message blocks . Moreover , the input states $ s_1 $ and $ s_2 $ would generally be unrelated , but the pseudocollisions ' input states are the same except for four bits . There does not seem to be any way to extend den Boer and Bosselaers ' approach to anything beyond the special pseudocollisions , a limitation they readily admit . It is reasonable , therefore , to believe that MD5 remains secure . While den Boer and Bosselaers have found interesting structural properties in MD5 , the properties seem only to lead to special pseudocollisions and not anything approaching real collisions . Further research , of course , will give a better understanding of the strengths of MD5 and other message-digest algorithms , with the eventual hope that such algorithms can , in some sense , be proved secure . \bibliographystyle { plain } \begin { thebibliography } { 1 } \bibitem { den-boer-md5 } Bert den~Boer and Antoon Bosselaers . \newblock Collisions for the compression function of { MD5 } . \newblock In { \it Advances in Cryptology -- - Eurocrypt '93 } , 1993 . \newblock Preprint . \bibitem { rfc-md5 } R.L .

Why can't > God just repeat the miracle done for Mary to make all the rest of us > sinless , without the need for repentance and salvation and all that ? Yes , Mary is fully human . However , that does not imply that she was just as subject to sin as we are . Catholic doctrine says that man's nature is good ( Gen 1:31 ) , but is damaged by Original Sin ( Rom 5:12-16 ) . In that case , being undamaged by Original Sin , Mary is more fully human than any of the rest of us . You ask why God can not `` repeat the miracle '' of Mary 's preservation from Original Sin . A better way to phrase it would be `` why _did_ He not '' do it that way , but you misunderstand how Mary 's salvation was obtained . Like ours , the Blessed Virgin Mary 's salvation was obtained through the merits of the Sacrifice of Christ on the Cross . However , as God is not bound by time , which is His creation , God is free to apply His Sacrifice to anyone at any time , even if that person lived before Christ came to Earth , from our time-bound perspective . Therefore , Christ 's Death and Resurrection still served a necessary purpose , and were necessary even for Mary 's salvation . - - - - - - - - - - Steve Creps , Indiana University creps @ lateran.ucs.indiana.edu

While I was a student , I had doctors remove rather surprising amounts of wax from my ears by flushing them out a couple times , usually because they were examining my ears for some other reason , and said something like `` Gee , you 've got a lot of wax in there '' . In my case , removal of these large wax buildups did noticeably improve my hearing , and I 've since gotten in the same habit as your wife of flushing them out with warm water from a little rubber bulb every few months . You can buy little bulbs together with ear drops for this express purpose from the drug store - I do n't notice that the drops accomplish much of anything . One question I do have - a doctor who flushed out my ears once also advocated a drop of rubbing alcohol in them afterwards to flush out any remaining trapped water - said he told swimmers to do this after swimming , too . It works , but it stings like the devil , so I 've always been content to let any water in my ears from swimming or flushing them out figure out how to get out by itself if shaking my head a few times wo n't do the trick . Any comments ?

Keywords : Plus , RAM Nntp-Posting-Host : mrisun.med.yale.edu Reply-To : gatenb @ mrisun.med.yale.edu Organization : Dept . of NMR Research , Yale School of Medicine Lines : 14 I have a mac plus with 2.5MB RAM . I have just bought an extra 2MB so that I can have the max 4MB RAM that a plus supports . However , I ca n't get it to boot after I install the 2 extra SIMMs . Instead I get a sad mac ( Sorry , but I ca n't remember the code ) . Looking at the motherboard , I can see that 2 resistors have been snipped off where it says `` 256Kb path - 1 row '' . I assume that was done when the first 1MB SIMMs were added . So , my question is : Are there any other resistors that need snipping ? or , Do I have bum SIMMs which need to be exchanged ? Any and all advice will be appreciated . Chris Gatenby gatenb @ mrisun.med.yale.edu

But Jesus more typically uses consequences as a threat . That 's quite different from Hell Classic ( TM ) . : - ) Jesus does n't sound like the usual hell-fire type of preacher . He attracts people through what he does . And the stongest example in Jesus preaching is in the parable of Lazarus and Dives , which is a parable ! In any case , my point is that a fear-based response to Christ is not a freeing , life-affirming choice and is n't Good News in a meaningful sense . There are plenty of good reasons to follow Jesus that have nothing to do with fear or a literal hell , that still pertain to overcoming in the present struggle between God and the Disloyal Opposition . A faith based in fear is not built on Rock , as we should found our faith , but on ice . If the fear were removed , there would BE no foundation . That 's basically why it matters to me . I think we have many Christians that DO N'T have a solid basis for relating to the living Incarnate God . I can not be fully open to the working of God in and through my life if my response to God is motivated on fear .

I 'm very surprised that medical schools still push routine circumcision of newborn males on the population . Since your friend is not a man , she ca n't imagine what it 's like to have a penis , much less a foreskin . I guess if American medicine did an artistic job of circumcising every male , then the visual result would be somewhat more natural in appearance ... The penile cancer thing has been *completely* debunked ... she must be going to school on a South Pacific island . Tell her to check the Journal or Urology for circumcision articles . I remember at least 1 on an old Jewish man ( cut at birth ) who developed penile cancer ... .I mean , if the cancer risk was that great , the Europe who have been circumcising like crazy , too . Teaching a boy how to keep his cockhead clean is the issue : a little proper hygiene goes a long way - Americans are just too hung up on the penis to consider cleaning it : that 's just way too much like mastubation . So you have surgical intervention that is basically unnecessary .

It has been a while since I knew the electronics of ham radio , but I seem to remember that PeP is actually 4x the `` real '' power . Which makes 1KW PeP actually around 250W . Or was it 2x ? I disremember . `` Effective transmitted power '' is also `` odd '' , in that it takes into account antenna height and geometry . Which is why a TV station with a 50KW Klystron might advertise a megawatt ( if their antenna is on the top of the CN tower ; - ) . This is like Sears HP ; - ) Though , 1500 real watts still is n't impossible . About 125-150A with a 12V alternator , less if the alternator produces higher voltages .

Went up to visit a friend overnight ( about 45 minute ride ) .. rode up after work , only minor drizzing for the last 5 minutes of the ride ... rest of the ride was very zen . Got up this morning , needed to go home and get some disks & stuff to work on her computers with , rainy as all hell . Soaked and cold by the time I got home . Since I did n't have another set of thermals which were dry , I said `` to heck with it '' and drove my cage back up . Lo and Behold , those funny blue clouds were up in the sky and this warm yellow thing I have n't seen in quite awhile showed up when I was 10 minutes into the trip . And me in my cage . Oh JOY . Happily , my right hand mirror finally showed up at the dealer ( dropped the bike when I first got it , put on an EMGO replacement mirror ... hated it the entire time that thing was on my bike because I could n't see a DAMNED thing through it , plus it 's flat instead of convex like the stock mirrors , so you get a NARROW ANGLE wobbly blur ) ... And I got a replacement windshield for my fairing ( dropped the original and chipped the front edge ... cosmetic but annoying ) ... so I spent half an hour happily unscrewing things and replacing them this afternoon . 'Bout the only thing I still hate about the bike ( '75 CB360T ) is the damned '' 2 D-Cell Flashlight '' headlight . Has anyone seen a good source for ~25 watt halogen passing lights ? Since the charging system on the CB360T ca n't handle continuous use of a 50W halogen headlight , I was thinking about putting a couple passing lights on ... that would give me ~70w of lighting for the rare night riding I do , but would n't drain the battery during `` normal use '' ( chiefly day trips and commuting to work and back ) ...

Neat . > > You could even build a spotlight that follows the dancer around on stage ! > > Can you tell us more about what you 're doing ? Sounds like a very cool program . Tis ' only a gleam in my eye at this point . I have yet to chose a tracking method . The initial requirement was to design a system to locate a dancer in one of eight zones across the stage . I did some experiments with pyroelectric detectors and found them difficult to align to get a definite zone transition . And dancers stand still alot , so their IR signature goes away . The good thing about pryoelectrics is that their signal is proportional to the size of the warm body ( or body part ) , and the velocity of said body . This could be useful for detecting the intensity of a dance gesture . Dancers also really hate to wear little boxes and batteries strapped on their bodies , but they really need to be emitting some kind of signal to be tracked . The current toy I have been working with is a program called Mandala for the Amiga , used with a LIVE ! video digitizer . This works with a video camera trained on the stage . You can set thresholds for a zone within the field of view , and an object brighter than the threshold will trigger an event . Events can be MIDI objects or sequences , Amiga sounds or graphic objects . It 's been fun to play with , but the documentaion is arcane , and the digitizer is noisy . Still , it 's very appealing , the dancers do n't have to wear any appliances , you can have ots of zone , s , it speaks MIDI , which can be used to control lights , and I do n't have to build any electronics . It 's all done with lighting and video brightness and contrast adjustments . I have yet to do anything particularly useful or artistic , but I have hopes ...

It sounds like your analysis is based on hypothesis and not actually using the Valentine-1 . I 'd like to give some feedback based on real life experince . I keep the Valentine-1 in advanced logic mode and it rarely lights up as a Christmas tree . The only time it does is when I am in the middle of a major shopping area and then it makes sense that is does since there are > = 8 sources coming from many different directions . I have found the Valentine-1 to be consistent in its reporting of bogeys regardless of any moving cars in the area . I have found the directional indication to be very useful . In one case there was two radar traps set up within one mile of each other . As I passed the first radar trap , the direction indication changed . Then the detector was set off again pointing in the forward direction . With other radar detectors I would have assumed that this was due to a reflection . But with the Valentine-1 I knew there was a high probability that there was another trap . And there was ! On other occasions , the directional helped discern a false alarm from a true alarm . For example , as I pass a source , the direction indicator changes . The directional also allows me to focus my attention as to where the signal might be coming from instead of having to look all over the place . When a car is approaching me from the rear with a detector that leaks , I can tell that the signal is coming from the rear and as the car passes me I can verify the source . With other detectors , I would have been unable to do this and would have had to assume that there was a radar trap when there was none . I 've had the Valentine-1 for several months now and find its added features to be useful and not gimmicks . -Barry -- -- -- - -- -- -- -- Barry Frishberg blf @ apollo.ch.hp.com Chelmsford-UK Expert Center 508/TN 436-4319 Chelmsford , MA

By the time trucks arrived 27 minutes later , the whole complex was aflame and it was clearly too little , too late ; there were just two pumpers and no water supply . The FBI made another call requesting a tank truck , but the Waco department apparently depended on hydrants and did not have one . Though clearly unwilling to risk firemen 's lives in the line of fire , it seems they might have done so had there been sufficient equipment and water to make a difference . They even aired a tape of a woman who called Waco 911 from Georgia asking if anything was being done . Civic-minded , but probably irresponsible ; if everyone watching television did that , no local calls could get through . ABC also aired the comments of an independent fire investigator who viewed tapes from more than one side of the compound ( not just the standard `` pool shot '' ) , and agreed that the fire a ) must have been started in at least 3 places , and b ) must have had an accelerant to spread so fast . Neither of these is conclusive proof that the Koresh crowd offed themselves more than the FBI offed them , but it 's a heck of a lot stronger proof than some of the `` theories '' floating around the net .

I dont know myself , and certainly havent heard any answers on this here . 2 ) Yes , one simple non-action , ie NOT attacking the compound with modified tanks , would have prevented this tragedy .

My wifes uncle was a 30+ level mason . He let me look at some of the books ( which after his death his `` brothers '' came over and took from his greiving widow before his body had even cooled ) . Do n't tell me you do n't worship Osiris . You must not be past your 20th level . You should read Wilkinson's Egyptians and how he shows this Egyptian religion paralleling his own British Masonry . There is a man here at this laboratory who is a 33 degree black mason . I 've talked with him , though much he likes to hide ( `` mystery '' ) . Special handshakes and all . When he first started trying to `` evangelize '' me , he told me all kinds on special this , and special that . Here is truely a '' mystery '' religion . THere is the public side with motorcyle mania and childrens hospitals and then there is the priviate side that only the highest degree mason every learns of . > > Second , worship of Osiris is not , nor has it ever been , a part of > Masonic practice ( we are strictly non-denominational ) . > I have n't read it , but the literature that is offered by the silver haired apologist ( ca n't remember his name ) on TV , did n't exactly come to this same conclusion . `` Khons , the son of the great goddess-mother , seems to have been gernaerally represented as a full-grown god . The Babylonian divinity was also represented very frequently in Egupt in the very same wayas in the land of his nativity -i.e . as a child in his mother 's arems . THis was the way in which Osiris , 'the son , the husband of his mother , ' was often exhibited , and what we learn of this god , equally as in the case of Khonso , shows that in his original he was none other than Nimrod . It is admitted that the secret system of Free Masonry was originally founded on the Mysteries of the Egyptian Isis , the goddess-mother , or wife of Osiris . But what could have led to the union of a Masonic body with these Mysteries , had they not had particular reference to architecture , and had the god who was worshipped in them not been celebrated for his success in perfecting the arts of fortification and building ? Now , if such were the case , considering the relation in which , as we have already seen , Egypt stood to Babylon , who would naturally be liiked up to there as the great patron of the Masonic art ? The strong presumption is , that Nimrod must have been the man . He was the first that gained faim in this way . As the child of the Babylonian goddess-mother , he was worshipped in the character of Ala mahozim , 'The God of Fortification . ' Osiris , the child of the Egyptian Modonna , was equally celebrated as 'the strong chief of the buildings . ' THis strong chief of the buildings was origninally worshipped in Egypt with every physicall characteristic of Nimrod . I have already noticed the fact that Nimrod , as the son of Cush , was a negro . Now , there was a tradition in Egypt , recorded by Plutarch , that 'Osiris was black ' ... ... . '' Hislop It was like a cold slap to my face , when my wifes uncle brought out his cerimonial dress and it was leopard skin . I mean real leopard skin . He told me that only the highest of degrees wore the leopard skin . ( The reason that he started telling me all this was that he had just been given a couple of months to live and my wife had led him to a saving faith in Christ and he immediately repented from 'mysteries ' of the lodge ! ) Nimr-rod from Nimr , a `` leopard , '' and rada or rad `` To subdue . '' It is a universal principle in all idolatries , that the high priest wears the insignia of the god he serves . Any representation of Osiris usually show the wearing of some leopard . It is interesting that the Druids of Britian also show , or should I say hide , this representation . They , however , worshipped the `` spotted cow '' . I 'll stand by my statements . Masonry is of the `` mystery '' religions that all find their source in Babylon , the great harlot . Sorry Peter , I do not mean to be a `` cold slap to the face '' but there is to much evidence to the contrary that Masonry does n't find its origins in Egypt . Of the Masons I have personally talked to , all refered to Egypt as their origin . Why are you now separating yourself from this which not many years ago , was freely admitted ? -Rex

From : jhpb @ sarto.budd-lake.nj.us ( Joseph H. Buehler ) Subject : Re : Public/Private Revelation ( formerly Re : Question about Virgin Mary Organization : none Lines : 44 ( Marty Helgesen ) writes : When an alleged private revelation attracts sufficient attention , the Church may investigate it . If the investigation indicates a likelihood that the alleged private revelation is in fact from God , it will be approved . That means that it can be preached in the Church . However , it is still true that no one is required to believe that it came from God . A Catholic is free to deny the authenticity of even the most well attested and strongly approved private revelations , such as those at Fatima and Lourdes . ( I suspect that few if any Catholics do reject Fatima and Lourdes , but if any do their rejection of them does not mean they are not orthodox Catholics in good standing . ) It may be a bit much to say that a Catholic is free to deny what happened at Fatima . That 's a bit strong , it is sort of like saying that a Catholic is free to deny that Hong Kong exists . What a Catholic *is* free to do is to deny the truth of Fatima , without being called a heretic . You can be labeled other things for such an offense , but not a heretic . Theologians make a basic distinction as far as the degree of assent one must give to events like Fatima and Lourdes . Things revealed by God through Jesus Christ or His Apostles must be given the assent due to a revelation of God : total and unswerving . Fatima and Lourdes demand our assent as much as any other well-attested event in human history . Perhaps a bit more , given the approval of the Church . `` Approval '' of an apparition by the Church principally means that whatever happened was in harmony with the Catholic Faith . I personally think of private revelations as our Lord 's way of telling us what to do at particular periods in history . He gave us all the doctrines , etc. , 2000 years ago , but we can always use some help in knowing how exactly to apply what He gave us . Catholic devotion to the Sacred Heart was a result of a series of apparitions to St. Margaret Mary Alacoque , for example . The problem at the time was extreme moral rigorism that was turning our Lord into someone without a heart . The Fatima apparitions were a warning of an impending crisis in the Church ( we are living it ) , and what to do to save the most souls possible in such a situation .

Well the monitor is consistently the largest power drain on your electric bill when you are looking at your computer set-up , especially if you have a large ( 16 '' or greater ) color monitor . Generally what I do is leave my Mac on all the time , except for the occasional resart or syetem crash , but I turn my monitor off each night before I leave my office . I also turn off After Dark when I do this , since there is no reason to have the screen saver running when there is no picture being displyed on the monitor 's tube . > Actually , I thought Macs were suppoused to be restarted once a day . Really ? What makes you think this ? The Q700 file server in my office has been on for the last 2 months , straight , and it has n't had any problems .

MILLER , JR '' A Canticle for Leibowitz '' One gem in this post atomic doomsday novel is the monks who spent their lives copying blueprints from `` Saint Leibowitz '' , filling the sheets of paper with ink and leaving white lines and letters . EDGAR PANGBORN '' Davy '' Post atomic doomsday novel set in clerical states . The church , for example , forbids that anyone `` produce , describe or use any substance containing ... atoms '' . PHILIP K. DICK Philip K. Dick Dick wrote many philosophical and thought-provoking short stories and novels . His stories are bizarre at times , but very approachable . He wrote mainly SF , but he wrote about people , truth and religion rather than technology . Although he often believed that he had met some sort of God , he remained sceptical . Amongst his novels , the following are of some relevance : '' Galactic Pot-Healer '' A fallible alien deity summons a group of Earth craftsmen and women to a remote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans . When the deity begins to demand faith from the earthers , pot-healer Joe Fernwright is unable to comply . A polished , ironic and amusing novel . `` A Maze of Death '' Noteworthy for its description of a technology-based religion . `` VALIS '' The schizophrenic hero searches for the hidden mysteries of Gnostic Christianity after reality is fired into his brain by a pink laser beam of unknown but possibly divine origin . He is accompanied by his dogmatic and dismissively atheist friend and assorted other odd characters . `` The Divine Invasion '' God invades Earth by making a young woman pregnant as she returns from another star system . Unfortunately she is terminally ill , and must be assisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to 24-hour easy listening music . MARGARET ATWOOD '' The Handmaid 's Tale '' A story based on the premise that the US Congress is mysteriously assassinated , and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it '' right '' again . The book is the diary of a woman 's life as she tries to live under the new Christian theocracy . Women 's right to own property is revoked , and their bank accounts are closed ; sinful luxuries are outlawed , and the radio is only used for readings from the Bible . Crimes are punished retroactively : doctors who performed legal abortions in the `` old world '' are hunted down and hanged . Atwood 's writing style is difficult to get used to at first , but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on . VARIOUS AUTHORS '' The Bible '' This somewhat dull and rambling work has often been criticized . However , it is probably worth reading , if only so that you 'll know what all the fuss is about . It exists in many different versions , so make sure you get the one true version .

RICHARD SWINBURNE '' The Existence of God ( Revised Edition ) '' , Clarendon Paperbacks , Oxford This book is the second volume in a trilogy that began with `` The Coherence of Theism '' ( 1977 ) and was concluded with `` Faith and Reason '' ( 1981 ) . In this work , Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the existence of God . His arguments , which are somewhat tendentious and rely upon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values and aesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived , were decisively rejected in Mackie 's `` The Miracle of Theism '' . In the revised edition of `` The Existence of God '' , Swinburne includes an Appendix in which he makes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut Mackie . J. L. MACKIE '' The Miracle of Theism '' , Oxford This ( posthumous ) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal arguments for and against the existence of God . It ranges from the classical philosophical positions of Descartes , Anselm , Berkeley , Hume et al , through the moral arguments of Newman , Kant and Sidgwick , to the recent restatements of the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne . It also addresses those positions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational , such as those of Kierkegaard , Kung and Philips , as well as `` replacements for God '' such as Lelie 's axiarchism . The book is a delight to read - less formalistic and better written than Martin 's works , and refreshingly direct when compared with the hand-waving of Swinburne . JAMES A.

When kids stayed in the home until kindergarden or 1st grade , infection incidence was much lower because exposure was lower . Some studies suggest that early exposure to various infectious diseases is probably beneficial because exposure as an adult carries much more risk of morbitity and mortality ( mumps , measles . etc. ) . > -- How often do kids in their first , second and third years fall sick ? > How often do they get colds , flus , ear infections ?

Daycare will always carry a higher exposure risk than home care . > -- Does being sick `` build immunity '' ( leading to less illness later ) , > does it make kids `` weaker '' ( leading to more illness later ) , or does it > not have any long term effect ? Exposure to infectious organisms does build immunity . But many viruses mutate and reexposure to the new strain requires another immune response ( new antibody production ) . In addition , antibody levels tend to decline with time and re-innoculation is needed to keep the antibody levels high . Chronic overstimulation of the immune response can lead to immunosupression but this is rare and very unlikely to occur in children . > -- Does taking antibiotics on a regular basis have any negative long > term effects ? Yes , chronic use of antibiotics can have an adverse effect on the good bacteria that are supposed to be present in and on the body . Health effects of this depletion of the good bacteria is a very hotly debated topic in the medical community with most physicians seeming to discount any health effects of chronic antibiotic use ( a view that I do not support ) . > -- How does one tell if a child is more susceptible to illness than > normal , and what does one do about it ? Chronic infection in an adult or a child needs to be worked up ( in my opinion ) . But most physicians feel that chronic infection in a child is normal because of both exposure and lack of prior immunity to many infectious diseases . I do not share this view and there are some physicians who also suspect that diet plays a big role in infection frequency and severity . Exposure to an infectious agent does not have to result in a severe infection . A strong immune response can minimize the length of time needed to deal with the infection as well as the symptoms associated with the infection . > -- Is there any way to build immunity and resistance ? There are five major nutrients that are responsible for a good strong immune response to infectious agents . They are : protein , vitamin C , vitamin A , iron and zinc . The American diet is not low in protein so this is rarely a problem . But vitamin A , vitamin C , iron and zinc are often low and this lack of an adequate pool ( nutrient reserve ) can impair the immune response . Iron is know to be low in most kids ( as is vitamin A ) . There are distinct biochemical tests that can be run to check the status of each of these nutrients in a patient who is having a problem with chronic severe infection . Serum ferritin for iron status , dark adaptation for vitamin A status , red blood cell zinc for zinc status and leckocyte ascorbate for vitamin C status . I have attempted to work up posts on these five nutrients and their role in infection for this news group as well as the others that I participate in . I can e-mail you what I 've worked up so far . But my best advice to you is to try to find a physician who recognizes the critical role that diet plays in the human immune response . You may also be able to get help from a nutritionist . Anyone can call themselves a nutritionist so you have to be very carefull . You want to find someone ( like myself ) who has had some formal training and education in nutrition . Many Ph.D. programs in the U.S. now offer degrees in Nutrition and that 's what you need to look for . Some dieticians will also call themselves nutritionists but most dieticians have not had the biochemical training needed to run specialized nutritional assessment tests . They are very good for getting general dietary advice from however . > Any data , information or advice relating to this would be much > appreciated . Thanks a lot . > > Ashwin .

To quote Unger 's Bible Dictionary on the Apocrapha : 1 . They abound in historical and geographical inaccuracies and anachronisms . 2 . They teach doctrines which are false and foster practices which are at variance with sacred Scripture . 3 . They resort to literary types and display an artificiality of subject matter and styling out of keeping with sacred Scripture . 4 . They lack the distinctive elements which give genuine Scripture their divine character , such as prophetic power and poetic and religious feeling . First , to point out the obvious : While # 4 would clearly be a highly subjective issue , one would be hard pressed to point to another book of the OT ( or for that matter the NT ) that does n't , on some issues , in some way , fail one or more of the first three of these tests . Second , one factor the Deuterocanonicals share is the lateness of their composition . I do n't recall the exact dating of all of the books , but most -- if not all -- were written after the latest of the canonical books ( i.e . Daniel ) . Furthermore , while the Deuterocanonical may or may not have been originally written in Greek , they are clearly deeply _Hellenistic_ in nature . Both of these features probably figured heavily in the rejection of these books from the various canons . These may not be strict and uniformly applicable criteria by which to judge the canonicity of these books , but , as these discussions have shown , I think the one thing we can see is that there _are_ no purely objective standards for determining canonicity .

While I 'm sure Sagan considers it sacrilegious , that would n't be because of his doubtfull credibility as an astronomer . Modern , ground-based , visible light astronomy ( what these proposed orbiting billboards would upset ) is already a dying field : The opacity and distortions caused by the atmosphere itself have driven most of the field to use radio , far infrared or space-based telescopes . In any case , a bright point of light passing through the field does n't ruin observations . If that were the case , the thousands of existing satellites would have already done so ( satelliets might not seem so bright to the eyes , but as far as astronomy is concerned , they are extremely bright . ) Frank Crary CU Boulder

My father told me when he was growing up Catholics were not allowed to associate with anyone who was divorced . There are a few verses prohibitting divorce . Somehow , divorce became acceptable ( even in Catholicism anullments ) . Certainly it is no longer a sin to associate with a divorced person . The point is that each person has their own temptations to deal with . Paul repeatedly talks about the '' thorn '' in his side , some think it refers to lust , others pride , but who knows . Whatever the thorn was , apparently it was not `` compatible '' with Christianity , yet does that make his epistles any less ? The Bible warns us against judging , greed , anxiety , impure thoughts , bearing grudges , etc. , etc . I suppose we should seek out all the so-called Christians who have entertained impure thoughts and oust them . All those who have given in to greed , get 'em outta here . Jesus pointed out that he was the physician for the sinners . Any attempts to make homosexuals feel unwelcome because of our discomfort with homosexuality is incompatible with Christianity . Is our hatred so deep that rather than see someone try to become closer to Jesus , we need to keep them away . Does Jesus need us to screen out those guilty of a particular sin . Do we really mistrust Jesus when he says he can forgive any sin ? Think about it . Among the people Jesus encountered were sinners and the Pharisees . The sinners he embraced and forgave . The Pharisees , hypocritcal , unmerciful , self-righteous , pointed out others sins and did not seek and thus did not gain forgiveness of their own sins . What I take from this and other verses is that if we do not admit our sins , those sins will not be forgiven . And since those guilty of even one sin are guilty of the whole law , those not repenting the judging of others are guilty , as guilty as if they committed the same sin they judged others of . The poor in spirit , meek , humble , merciful , pure of heart , peacemakers , those who thirst for justice , those who suffer for His sake are blessed . Joe Moore

OK ( but I 'm right ! ) : ^ ) > The official line here ( though I do have my doubts about it ) is that the > front brake is applied first , followed by the rear brake , the idea being > that you avoid locking up the rear after weight transfer takes place . If that 's the `` official line '' taught in those rider education classes you were refering to , that also do n't teach countersteering , I have to question the quality of the classes . The `` official line '' in MSF curricula is as I described . Maximum braking is achieved by applying both brakes equally , when the weight distribution is nominally even and both tires have equal normal forces , and easing off on the rear to prevent locking it , and increasing braking on the front , as more traction is available to the front due to increased normal force due to weight shift . The `` official line '' you have been taught seems ineffective on the face of it . Applying the rear brake after the front is not taking advantage of all the traction available to the rear at time 0 , and is halving the available braking power by using only the front at time 0 . > > Saying , `` brake until the tire just begins to slide '' is next to useless > > advice to a newbie .

I 'm not suggesting that you should always > aim to brake as hard as you possibly can - but if you want to find the > limits of the machine , you have to go beyond them . Not necessarily true . `` Chirping '' the tire indicates impending lockup ( on most surfaces ) , and serves as a good guide to newbies to indicate maximum braking . I agree that totally locking the front occasionally makes one a better rider , but it is a manuver best saved for an experienced rider , unless you have one of those outrigger bikes like Code used to use . > In any case , for maximum braking , if ( as I suggested ) you aim to keep > both wheels just on the point of sliding , then you 'll be doing > exactly as *you* suggest ! ! True , but from the point of view of how to best *teach* riding skills ( which is how this discussion started ) , `` keep both wheels just on the point of sliding '' is nearly useless information . You need to teach a *technique* , or at least a strategy , to achieve this . -- - Ed Green , former Ninjaite |I was drinking last night with a biker , Ed.Green @ East.Sun.COM |and I showed him a picture of you .

Organization : Post Office , Carnegie Mellon , Pittsburgh , PA Lines : 29 NNTP-Posting-Host : po2.andrew.cmu.edu I knew , despite the lack of a full game telecast last week , it was still too much hockey for Atlanta . Atlanta 's ABC has declined to pick up any playoff games till May9 . And even when they show the games on MAy9 and May16 , they will continue to skip the first half hour of the telecast . I know this is still a better situation compared to rest of Georgia , Alabama , etc. , but it is still pretty annoying . At least in PIttsburgh , we had a network preemptionchannel which showed all netwoork shows prempted by the local affiliate . I asked them what their problem was . I told them that a local 1.9 rating was not that bad considering it was the first NHL game shown after a long time without much promotion . Besides , their syndicated programming in the afternoon is usually low rated . So what did they have to lose by showing NHL playoffs . She told me that they had contractual obligations . I asked her if golf was shown oin ABC , would contractual obligations come in the way . And how come contractual obligations did n't come in the way of last week 's telecast ? She then could n't give me a coherent answer . Also , I added that Atlanta had one of the highest neutral site game attendances and that the demographics were good . I think ABC and other networks should begin to tie their high rated programs like Roseanne in with thier sports programming . I hope that everyone in Atlanta who reads this bboard calls WSB 2 and complain bitterlyt about this . Tell them you will stop watching their news telecasts since they seem to be very unprofessional in handling this situation . The lady did not seem to settle on a single reason . Sometimes , the reason is low ratings . Then another time , she says contractual obligations .

From : allan @ cs.UAlberta.CA ( Allan Sullivan ) Subject : Don Cherry - Coach 's Corner summary - April 21 , 1993 Nntp-Posting-Host : swanlake.cs.ualberta.ca Organization : University of Alberta , Edmonton , Canada Lines : 83 Here 's a summary of Don Cherry 's Coach 's Corner from April 21 , 1993 . The game being broadcast in my region was LA and Calgary , although I think it was filmed during the Toronto-Detroit game that night . ( Warning ... Anti-fighting people may want to skip this post . ) Topics -- -- -- Don 's Tie , Grant Fuhr , Penalties , Wings vs Leafs , Fighting , Dale Hunter . Episode Summary -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - This episode began with the camera zoomed in on Don 's tie . Don was pointing out the characters on the tie ... Bugs Bunny , Foghorn Leghorn , and Yosemite Sam ( who Don called Lanny Macdonald . ) Ron Maclean began by mentioning that Don was almost evicted from a hotel where he was watching the previous night 's games , because of all the yelling and cheering he was doing over the play of Hunter and Fuhr . Don began to praise Fuhr , calling him the `` greatest goalie '' , and said that he 's winning the series against Boston all by himself . He then showed clips from earlier episodes ( Nov. 14 , Jan. 16 ) when Fuhr was still with the Leafs , and Don advised `` Do n't Trade Fuhr ! '' Don went on to predict that if Buffalo gets by Boston , it would be Fuhr who wins the series . Muckler took a lot of heat for the trade , but Don feels Muckler 's been vindicated . The next topic involved how playoff games are being ruined by too many penalty calls . He showed a clip from a Winnipeg-Vancouver game , where Domi hit a Vancouver player , and was given a 2 min . penalty . Ron said that it was called a penalty because his stick was involved , but Don stuck with the opinion that it was a good hit , with Domi hitting the Vancouver player with his shoulder . Don : `` Its sad what they 're doing for hockey ... a 5 minute penalty for a nosebleed . '' Next , they went to the playoff series between Detroit and Toronto . People in Detroit were calling Wendel Clarke `` Wendy '' for not fighting . However , Don pointed out that Probert was not fighting either . This lead Don into a tirad about fighting and stickwork , and how banning fighting leads to more high sticking : `` It 's like college hockey ... The little wee guy with the visor is brave as anybody . That 's why you 're seeing so much stickwork . Because they know you wo n't drop your gloves and give them a shot . The rules are made by people who do n't know what 's going on in hockey '' . The final topic Don discussed was Dale Hunter . Don pointed out that he was leading the league in goals , and showed a clip of Hunter from a previous game . When he was younger , Hunter was taught to `` play to win '' , which differs from today 's idea of just letting kids have fun . At then end of the episode , they showed a clip from a coach's corner , with the tape on fast forward , so that Don sounded like one of the chipmunks . Rating -- -- -- Typical anti-fighting posturing , not too much humour , but some good quotes . I 'd give it a 7.0 out of 10 . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- \ \ |Allan Sullivan ( allan @ cs.ualberta.ca ) \ \ |Department of Computing Science , \ \_______ |University of Alberta , Edmonton , Alberta , Canada . \ # # # \ _ | -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - \___ # # # ___\ ( _ ) |My opinions are mine and mine alone . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- '' It is amazing how much can be accomplished if no one cares who gets the credit ...

Twist . CrimeStrike is working to reverse the disturbing trend of daily crime . It is promoting solutions that can be applied nationally , including tough and honest sentencing of the sort that Arizona is applying with its Truth in Sentencing law ; funding construction and staffing of appropriate prison space ; ensuring that the system is primed to punish serious youthful offenders ; strict attention to the rights of victims ; and citizen and community involvement . Phoenix will be the home for this national organization . The Gazette has vigorously opposed many NRA policies on issues of gun control , and will be resolute in promoting prudent laws that seek reasonable regulation of firearms . But CrimeStrike is an appropriate creation , a response to a clear need for more robust vigilance in holding legislators and judges ac- countable when it comes to swiftly and surely punishing criminals .

My fiancee ' and I do quite a bit of sporty riding 2-up . I 'll tell you what we 've found and the systems we 've worked out . - On starts , accelerate MUCH slower than usual . It 's tough for the rider to judge how scary fast acceleration is , because we 're holding onto something and leaning forward . Remember this . - On turns , have her lean forward and at the same angle as you ( normally this means she is n't leaning at all . ) It 's very disconcerting to be leaned over and have your passenger leaning so that they 're sitting straight up . Much balance is lost and this can be dangerous . - On slowing and stopping , do so MUCH slower than usual . Again , it 's tough for the rider to judge how scary fast deceleration is , because we 're holding onto something and leaning forward . However , you 'll figure it out fast because braking too fast will shove the passenger forward into you , which shoves you into the tank at an inopportune location . - Generally , have the passenger keep her knees against you and the bike , not out wide . This helps balance and gives her somegrip . - When you passenger is in fear , she will squeeze her knees against you . Normally this means `` slow down , and do it now ! '' . > turning so she leans *with* me , but what else ? Are there traditional > signals for SLOW DOWN ! ! or GO FASTER ! ! or I HAFTA GO PEE ! ! etc. ? ? ? We only have a couple signals . `` Slow down '' is her either tapping me on the back , or slapping my helmet with all her might . Depends on the urgency of the matter : - ) '' Turn here '' is done by her pointing in the direction of an exit . This is also the sign for `` cool ! Look at that . '' `` I hafta pee '' is the same sign as `` turn here '' . `` I 'm hungry '' is the same sign . `` Go faster '' is usually done by her jumping up and down on her pegs in glee . I usually see `` slow down '' more often than `` go faster '' . > I really want this to be a positive experience for us both , mainly so that > she 'll want to go with me again , so any help will be appreciated ... The best thing to do before the ride is to talk to a riding buddy , and pillion on his or her bike . It 's incredibly frustrating , because you 're in almost no control . Now , multiply that feeling times ten , because you as a rider know what your bike will do , and your passenger will likely feel you 're about to scrape hard parts all the time , or lock up the brakes at any moment , or go careening off the edge of a volcanic mountain , etc . Pillioning yourself is good training to take somebody on your pillion pad . Also , remember that it 's much more draining and tiring to ride 2-up than by yourself , because you 're concentrating on much more , and '' in the Zen of the moment '' less .

JPEG ( pronounced `` jay-peg '' ) is a standardized image compression mechanism . JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group , the original name of the committee that wrote the standard . JPEG is designed for compressing either full-color or gray-scale digital images of `` natural '' , real-world scenes . It does not work so well on non-realistic images , such as cartoons or line drawings . JPEG does not handle black-and-white ( 1-bit-per-pixel ) images , nor does it handle motion picture compression . Standards for compressing those types of images are being worked on by other committees , named JBIG and MPEG respectively . JPEG is `` lossy '' , meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't quite identical to what you originally put in . The algorithm achieves much of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye , notably the fact that small color details are n't perceived as well as small details of light-and-dark . Thus , JPEG is intended for compressing images that will be looked at by humans . If you plan to machine-analyze your images , the small errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you , even if they are invisible to the eye . A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjusting compression parameters . This means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality . You can make *extremely* small files if you do n't mind poor quality ; this is useful for indexing image archives , making thumbnail views or icons , etc . etc . Conversely , if you are n't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting , you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied , and accept lesser compression . [ 2 ] Why use JPEG ? There are two good reasons : to make your image files smaller , and to store 24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data . Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images . Being able to compress a 2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time ! ( If you are comparing GIF and JPEG , the size ratio is more like four to one . More details below . ) If your viewing software does n't support JPEG directly , you 'll have to convert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images . Even with a JPEG-capable viewer , it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image than to view an image of a simpler format ( GIF , for instance ) . Thus , using JPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff : you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply . It 's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved , the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file . I 'll let you do the arithmetic yourself . The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet posting format is that JPEG can store full color information : 24 bits/pixel ( 16 million colors ) instead of 8 or less ( 256 or fewer colors ) . If you have only 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you . Within a couple of years , though , 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as black-and-white MacPaint format does today . Furthermore , for reasons detailed in section 7 , JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware . Hence JPEG is considerably more appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard . [ 3 ] When should I use JPEG , and when should I stick with GIF ? JPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely ; for some types of images , GIF is superior in image quality , file size , or both . One of the first things to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to . As a rule of thumb , JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or gray-scale images of `` realistic '' scenes ; that means scanned photographs and similar material . JPEG is superior even if you do n't have 24-bit display hardware , and it is a LOT superior if you do . ( See section 7 for details . ) GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors , such as cartoons and line drawings . In particular , large areas of pixels that are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by GIF . JPEG ca n't squeeze these files as much as GIF does without introducing visible defects . This sort of image is best kept in GIF form . ( In particular , single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files , but they should be avoided in JPEG files . ) JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges : a row of pure-black pixels adjacent to a row of pure-white pixels , for example . Sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting . Again , this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs , but it shows up fairly often in GIF files : borders , overlaid text , etc . The blurriness is particularly objectionable with text that 's only a few pixels high . If you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text , do n't JPEG it . Computer-drawn images ( ray-traced scenes , for instance ) usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity . The more complex and subtly rendered the image , the more likely that JPEG will do well on it . The same goes for semi-realistic artwork ( fantasy drawings and such ) . Plain black-and-white ( two level ) images should never be converted to JPEG . You need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale images . It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images of up to 256 levels , while JPEG is not . If you have an existing library of GIF images , you may wonder whether you should convert them to JPEG . You will lose a little image quality if you do . ( Section 7 , which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF , only applies if both formats start from a full-color original . If you start from a GIF , you 've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information ; JPEG can only make things worse . ) However , the disk space savings may justify converting anyway . This is a decision you 'll have to make for yourself . If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG , see section 14 for hints . Be prepared to leave some images in GIF format , since some GIFs will not convert well . [ 4 ] How well does JPEG compress images ? Pretty darn well . Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have handy , a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor . The first three files are for comparison purposes ; the rest were created with the free JPEG software described in section 6B . File Size in bytes Comments ship.ppm 1145040 Original file in PPM format ( no compression ; 24 bits or 3 bytes per pixel , plus a few bytes overhead ) ship.ppm.Z 963829 PPM file passed through Unix compress compress does n't accomplish a lot , you 'll note . Other text-oriented compressors give similar results . ship.gif 240438 Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif Most of the savings is the result of losing color info : GIF saves 8 bits/pixel , not 24 . ( See sec . 7 . ) ship.jpg95 155622 cjpeg -Q 95 ( highest useful quality setting ) This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original , at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs . ship.jpg75 58009 cjpeg -Q 75 ( default setting ) You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this from the original , even with both on-screen at once . ship.jpg50 38406 cjpeg -Q 50 This has slight defects ; if you know what to look for , you could tell it 's been JPEGed without seeing the original . Still as good image quality as many recent postings in Usenet pictures groups . ship.jpg25 25192 cjpeg -Q 25 JPEG 's characteristic `` blockiness '' becomes apparent at this setting ( djpeg -blocksmooth helps some ) . Still , I 've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were of poorer image quality than this . ship.jpg5o 6587 cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize ( -optimize cuts table overhead ) Blocky , but perfectly satisfactory for preview or indexing purposes . Note that this file is TINY : the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 ! In this case JPEG can make a file that 's a factor of four or five smaller than a GIF of comparable quality ( the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the GIF , better if you have a full-color display ) . This seems to be a typical ratio for real-world scenes . [ 5 ] What are good `` quality '' settings for JPEG ? Most JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting . There seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings . `` Quality 95 '' does NOT mean `` keep 95 % of the information '' , as some have claimed . The quality scale is purely arbitrary ; it 's not a percentage of anything . The name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting ( smallest file size ) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original . This setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another , but here are some rules of thumb . The default quality setting ( -Q 75 ) is very often the best choice . This setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image . Try -Q 75 first ; if you see defects , then go up . Except for experimental purposes , never go above -Q 95 ; saying -Q 100 will produce a file two or three times as large as -Q 95 , but of hardly any better quality . If the image was less than perfect quality to begin with , you might be able to go down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation . On the other hand , you might need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation . The second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG . The default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images , but -Q 85 to 95 is usually better for converting GIFs ( see section 14 for more info ) . If you want a very small file ( say for preview or indexing purposes ) and are prepared to tolerate large defects , a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is about right . -Q 2 or so may be amusing as `` op art '' . ( Note : the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG software described in section 6B , and to many programs based on it . Other JPEG implementations , such as Image Alchemy , may use a completely different quality scale . Some programs do n't even provide a numeric scale , just '' high '' / '' medium '' / '' low '' -style choices . ) [ 6 ] Where can I get JPEG software ? Most of the programs described in this section are available by FTP . If you do n't know how to use FTP , see the FAQ article `` How to find sources '' . ( If you do n't have direct access to FTP , read about ftpmail servers in the same article . ) That article appears regularly in news.answers , or you can get it by sending e-mail to mail-server @ rtfm.mit.edu with '' send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources '' in the body . The `` Anonymous FTP List FAQ '' may also be helpful -- - it 's usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in the news.answers archive . NOTE : this list changes constantly . If you have a copy more than a couple months old , get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive . [ 6A ] If you are looking for `` canned '' software , viewers , etc : The first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one kind of system . If you do n't see what you want for your machine , check out the portable JPEG software described at the end of the list . Note that this list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over Internet ; but some commercial programs are listed too . X Windows : XV ( shareware , $ 25 ) is an excellent viewer for JPEG , GIF , and many other image formats . It can also do format conversion and some simple image manipulations . It 's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu ( 18.24.0.12 ) , file contrib/xv-3.00.tar.Z . Version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support for 24-bit displays and many other improvements ; however , it is brand new and still has some bugs lurking . If you prefer not to be on the bleeding edge , stick with version 2.21 , also available from export . Note that version 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display ( you 'll get only 8-bit color ) , nor for converting 24-bit images to JPEG . But 2.21 works fine for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG . CAUTION : there is a glitch in version 2.21 : be sure to check the `` save at normal size '' checkbox when saving a JPEG file , or the file will be blurry . Another good choice for X Windows is John Cristy 's free ImageMagick package , also available from export.lcs.mit.edu , file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z . This package handles many image processing and conversion tasks . The ImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly ; for colormapped displays , it does better ( though slower ) color quantization than XV or the basic free JPEG software . Both of the above are large , complex packages . If you just want a simple image viewer , try xloadimage or xli . xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest release , 3.03. xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu , file contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.Z . xli is a variant version of xloadimage , said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original . ( The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage , at least with respect to JPEG files , because it has the IJG v4 decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1 . The next xloadimage release will fix this . ) xli is also free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu , file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z . Both programs are said to do the right thing with 24-bit displays . MS-DOS : This covers plain DOS ; for Windows or OS/2 programs , see the next headings . One good choice is Eric Praetzel 's free DVPEG , which views JPEG and GIF files . The current version , 2.5 , is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca ( 129.97.50.50 ) , file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip . This is a good basic viewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines . The user interface is not flashy , but it 's functional . Another freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei 's Hiview . The current version , 1.2 , is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites ( see NOTE below ) , file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip . Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU and a VCPI-compatible memory manager ( QEMM386 and 386MAX work ; Windows and OS/2 do not ) . Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no bigger than your screen . For larger images , it scales the image down to fit on the screen ( rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do ) . You may or may not prefer this approach , but there 's no denying that it slows down loading of large images considerably . Note : installation is a bit tricky ; read the directions carefully ! A shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ( $ 30 ) . This is easier to install than either of the two freeware alternatives . Its user interface is also much spiffier-looking , although personally I find it harder to use -- - more keystrokes , inconsistent behavior . It is faster than DVPEG but a little slower than Hiview , at least on my hardware . ( For images larger than screen size , DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed , and both are faster than Hiview . ) The current version is 2.1 , available from Simtel20 and mirror sites ( see NOTE below ) , file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip . Requires a VESA graphics driver ; if you do n't have one , look in vesadrv2.zip or vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory . ( Many recent PCs have a built-in VESA driver , so do n't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains that the driver is missing . ) A second shareware alternative is Fullview , which has been kicking around the net for a while , but I do n't know any stable archive location for it . The current ( rather old ) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway . The author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly and it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time . The well-known GIF viewer CompuShow ( CSHOW ) supports JPEG in its latest revision , 8.60a . However , CSHOW 's JPEG implementation is n't very good : it 's slow ( about half the speed of the above viewers ) and image quality is poor except on hi-color displays . Too bad ... it 'd have been nice to see a good JPEG capability in CSHOW . Shareware , $ 25 . Available from Simtel20 and mirror sites ( see NOTE below ) , file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip . Due to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware , any one of these viewers might not work on your particular machine . If you ca n't get *any* of them to work , you 'll need to use one of the following conversion programs to convert JPEG to GIF , then view with your favorite GIF viewer . ( If you have hi-color hardware , do n't use GIF as the intermediate format ; try to find a TARGA-capable viewer instead . VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right thing with hi-color displays . ) The Independent JPEG Group 's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20 and mirror sites ( see NOTE below ) , file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip ( or jpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory ) . These files are DOS compilations of the free source code described in section 6B ; they will convert JPEG to and from GIF , Targa , and PPM formats . Handmade Software offers free JPEG < = > GIF conversion tools , GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF . These are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format ; in particular , you ca n't get 24-bit color output from a JPEG . The major advantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI 's proprietary JPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format . Since HSI-format files are rather widespread on BBSes , this is a useful capability . Version 2.0 of these tools is free ( prior versions were shareware ) . Get it from Simtel20 and mirror sites ( see NOTE below ) , file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip . NOTE : do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet , since it is not readable on non-PC platforms . Handmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation package , Image Alchemy . This will translate JPEG files ( both JFIF and HSI formats ) to and from many other image formats . It can also display images . A demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites ( see NOTE below ) , file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip . NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20 : The Internet 's key archive site for PC-related programs is Simtel20 , full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil ( 192.88.110.20 ) . Simtel20 runs a non-Unix system with weird directory names ; where this document refers to directory ( eg ) `` msdos/graphics '' at Simtel20 , that really means '' pd1 : < msdos.graphics > '' . If you are not physically on MILnet , you should expect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20 . There are several Internet sites that maintain copies ( mirrors ) of the Simtel20 archives ; most FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead . A popular USA mirror site is oak.oakland.edu ( 141.210.10.117 ) , which keeps Simtel20 files in ( eg ) `` /pub/msdos/graphics '' . If you have no FTP capability , you can retrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail ; see informational postings in comp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how . If you are outside the USA , consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is . Microsoft Windows : There are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images . ( Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware , due to Windows ' system overhead . Note that you can run the DOS conversion programs described above inside a Windows DOS window . ) The newest entry is WinECJ , which is free and EXTREMELY fast . Version 1.0 is available from ftp.rahul.net , file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip . Requires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode . This is a no-frills viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it decodes ; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers . But it 's so fast you 'll use it anyway , at least for previewing ... JView is freeware , fairly fast , has good on-line help , and can write out the decompressed image in Windows BMP format ; but it ca n't create new JPEG files , and it does n't view GIFs . JView also lacks some other useful features of the shareware viewers ( such as brightness adjustment ) , but it's an excellent basic viewer . The current version , 0.9 , is available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu ( 129.79.20.84 ) , file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip . ( Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites , including wuarchive.wustl.edu . ) WinJPEG ( shareware , $ 20 ) displays JPEG , GIF , Targa , TIFF , and BMP image files ; it can write all of these formats too , so it can be used as a converter . It has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and slideshow . The current version is 2.1 , available from Simtel20 and mirror sites ( see NOTE above ) , file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip . ( This is a slow 286-compatible version ; if you register , you 'll get the 386-only version , which is roughly 25 % faster . ) ColorView is another shareware entry ( $ 30 ) . This was an early and promising contender , but it has not been updated in some time , and at this point it has no real advantages over WinJPEG . If you want to try it anyway , the current version is 0.97 , available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu , file pub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip . ( I understand that a new version will be appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS . ) DVPEG ( see DOS heading ) also works under Windows , but only in full-screen mode , not in a window . OS/2 : The following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu ( 128.123.35.151 ) . Note : check /pub/uploads for more recent versions -- - the hobbes moderator is not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories . /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip 32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs , version 4 . /pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip 16-bit version of same , for OS/2 1.x . /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc12.zip Image Archiver 1.02 : image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface . Strong on conversion functions , viewing is a bit weaker . Shareware , $ 15 . /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip PMJPEG 1.1 : OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG , a popular viewer for Windows ( see description in Windows section ) . Shareware , $ 20 . /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview85.zip PMView 0.85 : JPEG/GIF/BMP/Targa/PCX viewer . GIF viewing very fast , JPEG viewing roughly the same speed as the above two programs . Has image manipulation & slideshow functions . Shareware , $ 20 . Macintosh : Most Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple 's JPEG implementation , which is part of the QuickTime system extension ; so you need to have QuickTime installed . To use QuickTime , you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running System 6.0.7 or later . ( If you 're running System 6 , you must also install the 32-bit QuickDraw extension ; this is built-in on System 7 . ) You can get QuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com , file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx . ( As of 11/92 , this file contains QuickTime 1.5 , which is better than QT 1.0 in several ways . With respect to JPEG , it is marginally faster and considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file . However , some applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5 . ) Mac users should keep in mind that QuickTime 's JPEG format , PICT/JPEG , is not the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format . ( See section 10 for details . ) If you post images on Usenet , make sure they are in JFIF format . Most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format . The first choice is probably JPEGView , a free program for viewing images that are in JFIF format , PICT/JPEG format , or GIF format . It also can convert between the two JPEG formats . The current version , 2.0 , is a big improvement over prior versions . Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu ( 36.44.0.6 ) , file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx . Requires System 7 and QuickTime . On 8-bit displays , JPEGView usually produces the best color image quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers . JPEGView can view large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers ; in fact , it's the only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a typical 4MB Mac . Given a large image , JPEGView automatically scales it down to fit on the screen , rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers . ( You can zoom in on any desired portion , though . ) Some people like this behavior , some do n't . Overall , JPEGView 's user interface is very well thought out . GIFConverter , a shareware ( $ 40 ) image viewer/converter , supports JFIF and PICT/JPEG , as well as GIF and several other image formats . The latest version is 2.3.2 . Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu , file /info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx . Requires System 6.0.5 or later . GIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer , but it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capabilities , so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of playing around with images . Also , the newest version of GIFConverter can load and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime , so it is your best bet if your machine is too old to run QuickTime . ( But it 's faster with QuickTime . ) Note : If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG , try converting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert , then viewing the GIF version . JPEG Convert , a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities , is available from sumex-aim.stanford.edu , file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx . This will run on any Mac , but it only does file conversion , not viewing . You can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer . Previous versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6 , a JPEG < = > GIF converter based on an old version of the IJG code . If you are using this program , you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert . Apple 's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF , QuickTime JPEG , and GIF format , and can convert between these formats . You can get PictPixie from ftp.apple.com , file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx . Requires QuickTime . PictPixie was intended as a developer 's tool , and it's really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime . Some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory , it produces relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display , and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface . Worse , PictPixie is an unsupported program , meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not intend to fix . ( There is an old version of PictPixie , called PICTCompressor , floating around the net . If you have this you should trash it , as it 's even buggier . Also , the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much cleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor . Note that Picture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net . ) Storm Technology 's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter . This rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways , but it will run without System 7 or QuickTime , so you may be forced to use it on older systems . ( It does need 32-bit QuickDraw , so really old machines can't use it . ) You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu , file /info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx . You must set the file type of a downloaded image file to 'JPEG ' to allow Picture Decompress to open it . If your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw ( a Mac Plus for instance ) , GIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing . If you do n't want to pay for GIFConverter , use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer . More and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG , although not all can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format . Adobe Photoshop , version 2.0.1 or later , can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files ( use the JPEG plug-in from the Acquire menu ) . You must set the file type of a downloaded JPEG file to 'JPEG ' to allow Photoshop to recognize it . Amiga : ( Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at amiga.physik.unizh.ch ( 130.60.80.80 ) . There are many mirror sites of this archive and you should try to use the closest one . In the USA , a good choice is wuarchive.wustl.edu ; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/ ... ) HamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter , as well as being a general image manipulation tool . It 's cheap ( shareware , $ 20 ) and can read several formats besides JPEG . The current version is 2.0.8 . A demo version is available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch ( and mirror sites ) , file amiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha . The demo version will crop images larger than 512x512 , but it is otherwise fully functional . Rend24 ( shareware , $ 30 ) is an image renderer that can display JPEG , ILBM , and GIF images . The program can be used to create animations , even capturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave . The current version is 1.05 , available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch ( and mirror sites ) , file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha . ( Note : although this directory is supposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs , the program will also run under AmigaDOS 1.3 , 2.04 or 2.1 . ) Viewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer . The current version is 1.04 , available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch ( and mirror sites ) , file amiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha . If you 're willing to spend real money , there are several commercial packages that support JPEG . Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel , the author of Rend24 and Viewtek . These are CineMorph , a standalone image morphing package , and ImageFX , an impressive 24-bit image capture , conversion , editing , painting , effects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph . Both are distributed by Great Valley Products . Art Department Professional ( ADPro ) , from ASDG Inc , is the most widely used commercial image manipulation software for Amigas . ImageMaster , from Black Belt Systems , is another well-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support . The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from amiga.physik.unizh.ch ( and mirror sites ) in directory amiga/gfx/conv , file AmigaJPEGV4.lha . These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM , GIF , Targa formats . The Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs , many based on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software ( thanks to a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month , without so much as notifying the authors ) . Among these are `` AugJPEG '' , `` NewAmyJPEG '' , '' VJPEG '' , and probably others I have not even heard of . In my opinion , anything older than IJG version 3 ( March 1992 ) is not worth the disk space it 's stored on ; if you have such a program , trash it and get something newer . Atari ST : The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST , TT , etc , from atari.archive.umich.edu , file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo . These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM , GIF , Targa formats . For monochrome ST monitors , try MGIF , which manages to achieve four-level grayscale effect by flickering . Version 4.1 reads JPEG files . Available from atari.archive.umich.edu , file /atari/Graphics/mgif41b.zoo . I have not heard of any other free or shareware JPEG-capable viewers for Ataris , but surely there must be some by now ? Pointers appreciated . Acorn Archimedes : ! ChangeFSI , supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10 , can convert from and view JPEG JFIF format . Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG , although this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking . Recent versions ( since 7.11 ) of the shareware program Translator can handle JPEG , along with about 30 other image formats . While older versions can be found on some Archimedes bboards , the current version is only available by registering with the author , John Kortink , Nutterbrink 31 , 7544 WJ , Enschede , The Netherlands . Price 35 Dutch guilders ( about $ 22 or 10 pounds ) . There 's also a commercial product called ! JPEG which provides JPEG read/write functionality and direct JPEG viewing , as well as a host of other image format conversion and processing options . This is more expensive but not necessarily better than the above programs . Contact : DT Software , FREEPOST , Cambridge , UK . Tel : 0223 841099 . NeXT : ImageViewer is a PD utility that displays images and can do some format conversions . The current version reads JPEG but does not write it . ImageViewer is available from the standard NeXT archives at sonata.cc.purdue.edu and cs.orst.edu , somewhere in /pub/next ( both are currently being re-organized , so it 's hard to point to specific sub-directories ) . Note that there is an older version floating around that does not support JPEG . Portable software for almost any system : If none of the above fits your situation , you can obtain and compile the free JPEG conversion software described in 6B . You 'll also need a viewer program . If your display is 8 bits or less , any GIF viewer will do fine ; if you have a display with more color capability , try to find a viewer that can read Targa or PPM 24-bit image files . There are numerous commercial JPEG offerings , with more popping up every day . I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find the available free or shareware software vastly too slow . In that case , purchase a hardware-assisted product . Ask pointed questions about whether the product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can handle the JFIF file format ; many of the earliest commercial releases are not and never will be compatible with anyone else 's files . [ 6B ] If you are looking for source code to work with : Free , portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent JPEG Group , which I lead . A package containing our source code , documentation , and some small test files is available from several places . The `` official '' archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net ( 137.39.1.9 or 192.48.96.9 ) . Look under directory /graphics/jpeg ; the current release is jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z . ( This is a compressed TAR file ; do n't forget to retrieve in binary mode . ) You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP . If you are on a PC and do n't know how to cope with .tar.Z format , you may prefer ZIP format , which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites ( see NOTE above ) , file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip . This file will also be available on CompuServe , in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum ( GO PICS ) , library 15 , as jpsrc4.zip . If you have no FTP access , you can retrieve the source from your nearest comp.sources.misc archive ; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34 . ( If you do n't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings , see the FAQ article `` How to find sources '' , referred to at the top of section 6 . ) The free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG `` JFIF '' format and image files in GIF , PBMPLUS PPM/PGM , Utah RLE , and Truevision Targa file formats . The core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other programs , such as image viewers . The package is highly portable ; we have tested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays . We have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use . Companies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products . We do not ask a royalty , although we do ask for an acknowledgement in product literature ( see the README file in the distribution for details ) . We hope to make this software industrial-quality -- - although , as with anything that 's free , we offer no warranty and accept no liability . The Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization ; if you 'd like to contribute to improving our software , you are welcome to join . [ 7 ] What 's all this hoopla about color quantization ? Most people do n't have full-color ( 24 bit per pixel ) display hardware . Typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel , so it can display 256 or fewer distinct colors at a time . To display a full-color image , the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors . This process is called `` color quantization '' . ( This is something of a misnomer , `` color selection '' would be a better term . We 're stuck with the standard usage though . ) Clearly , color quantization is a lossy process . It turns out that for most images , the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG ( except at the very lowest JPEG quality settings ) . Since JPEG is a full-color format , converting a color JPEG image for display on 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization . This is true for *all* color JPEGs : even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG , what comes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors , but thousands of colors . This happens because JPEG 's lossiness affects each pixel a little differently , so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors . Each original color gets `` smeared '' into a group of nearby colors . Therefore quantization is always required to display a color JPEG on a colormapped display , regardless of the image source . The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output . ( Incidentally , because of this effect it 's nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a JPEG image . Even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values , different JPEG decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences . I occasionally see posted images described as `` 256-color JPEG '' . This tells me that the poster ( a ) has n't read this FAQ and ( b ) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF . JPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale ( just like photographs ) , but number of colors just is n't a useful concept for JPEG . ) On the other hand , a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to 256 or fewer colors . ( A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its palette , and the format does n't allow more than 256 palette entries . ) For purposes of Usenet picture distribution , GIF has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization , so recipients do n't have to . This is also the *disadvantage* of GIF : you 're stuck with the sender's quantization . If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display , you have to re-quantize , resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image . Furthermore , if the sender did n't use a high-quality color quantization algorithm , you 're out of luck . For this reason , JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines do n't match the sender 's display hardware . JPEG 's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user 's display hardware . Furthermore , you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms ( there is a lot of active research in this area ) , or purchase better display hardware , to get a better view of JPEG images you already have . With a GIF , you 're stuck forevermore with what was sent . It 's also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines . If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA display , for example , you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to . This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations ( one to create the GIF , one to display it ) , but often it's also due to sloppiness . JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all , and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed . Thus , JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average GIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones ! Finally , an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display hardware already : 15-bit `` hi-color '' PC displays , true 24-bit displays on workstations and Macintoshes , etc . For these people , GIF is already obsolete , as it can not represent an image to the full capabilities of their display . JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively . Thus , JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images in a machine-independent fashion . [ 8 ] How does JPEG work ? The buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling , discrete cosine transforms , coefficient quantization , and Huffman or arithmetic entropy coding . This article 's long enough already , so I 'm not going to say more than that here . For technical information , see the comp.compression FAQ . This is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu , in files /pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part [ 1-3 ] . If you need help in using the news.answers archive , see the top of this article . [ 9 ] What about lossless JPEG ? There 's a great deal of confusion on this subject . The JPEG committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm , i.e. , one that guarantees the final output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input . However , this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular , lossy JPEG algorithm , and it offers much less compression . At present , very few implementations of lossless JPEG exist , and all of them are commercial . Saying `` -Q 100 '' to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image . What it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step . There is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step . ( With the V4 free JPEG code , you can also say '' -sample 1x1 '' to turn off subsampling . Keep in mind that many commercial JPEG implementations can not cope with the resulting file . ) Even with both quantization and subsampling turned off , the regular JPEG algorithm is not lossless , because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations . The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value ; it 's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye , but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image . At this minimum-loss setting , regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image . True lossless JPEG provides roughly the same amount of compression , but it guarantees bit-for-bit accuracy . If you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than 6 bits per pixel ( per color component ) , you may want to look into the JBIG bilevel image compression standard . This performs better than JPEG lossless on such images . JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with 6 or more bits per pixel ; furthermore , JPEG is public domain ( at least with a Huffman back end ) , while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents . [ 10 ] Why all the argument about file formats ? Strictly speaking , JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms ; it does *not* refer to a specific image file format . The JPEG committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations . Since we ca n't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format , this leaves us with a problem . In the absence of official standards , a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to '' do their own thing '' , and as a result their programs are n't compatible with anybody else 's . The closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work that 's been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems . They have defined two JPEG-based file formats : * JFIF ( JPEG File Interchange Format ) , a `` low-end '' format that transports pixels and not much else . * TIFF/JPEG , aka TIFF 6.0 , an extension of the Aldus TIFF format . TIFF is a `` high-end '' format that will let you record just about everything you ever wanted to know about an image , and a lot more besides : - ) . TIFF is a lot more complex than JFIF , and may well prove less transportable , because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different and incompatible subsets of TIFF . It 's not likely that adding JPEG to the mix will do anything to improve this situation . Both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of JPEG-related products ; it 's reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards . I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in picture postings . JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now ; the TIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted , and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details . Even when TIFF/JPEG is well defined , the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported `` lowest common denominator '' ; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable . A particular case that people may be interested in is Apple 's QuickTime software for the Macintosh . QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped inside the Mac-specific PICT structure . Conversion between JFIF and QuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward , and several Mac programs are available to do it ( see Mac portion of section 6A ) . If you have an editor that handles binary files , you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF by hand ; see section 11 for details . Another particular case is Handmade Software 's programs ( GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and Image Alchemy ) . These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF format . By default , though , they write a proprietary format developed by HSI . This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be used for Usenet postings . Use the -j switch to get JFIF output . ( This applies to old versions of these programs ; the current releases emit JFIF format by default . You still should be careful not to post HSI-format files , unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms . ) [ 11 ] How do I recognize which file format I have , and what do I do about it ? If you have an alleged JPEG file that your software wo n't read , it 's likely to be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format . You can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file : 1 . A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters ( hex ) FF D8 FF E0 , followed by two variable bytes ( often hex 00 10 ) , followed by 'JFIF ' . 2 . If you see FF D8 at the start , but not the rest of it , you may have a `` raw JPEG '' file . This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software -- - it 's worth a try , anyway . 3 . HSI files start with 'hsi1 ' . You 're out of luck unless you have HSI software . Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data , but they wo n't decompress properly with non-HSI programs . 4 . A Macintosh PICT file , if JPEG-compressed , will have a couple hundred bytes of header followed by a JFIF header ( scan for 'JFIF ' ) . Strip off everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it . 5 . Anything else : it 's a proprietary format , or not JPEG at all . If you are lucky , the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream . If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream ( look for FF D8 ) , try stripping off everything before that . In uuencoded Usenet postings , the characteristic JFIF pattern is '' begin '' line M_ ] C_X ... whereas uuencoded HSI files will start with '' begin '' line M : '-I ... If you learn to check for the former , you can save yourself the trouble of downloading non-JFIF files . [ 12 ] What about arithmetic coding ? The JPEG spec defines two different `` back end '' modules for the final output of compressed data : either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed . The choice has no impact on image quality , but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file . On typical images , arithmetic coding produces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding . ( All the file-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding . ) Unfortunately , the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the JPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM , AT & T , and Mitsubishi . Thus *you can not legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses from these companies . ( The `` fair use '' doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm , but actually storing any images with it is dubious at best . ) At least in the short run , I recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding ; the space savings is n't great enough to justify the potential legal hassles . In particular , arithmetic coding *should not* be used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet . There is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future . Stay tuned for further details . [ 13 ] Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression ? It would be nice if , having compressed an image with JPEG , you could decompress it , manipulate it ( crop off a border , say ) , and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially . Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE . In general , recompressing an altered image loses more information , though usually not as much as was lost the first time around . The next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it *without changing it* then there is no further loss , i.e. , you get an identical JPEG file . Even this is not true ; at least , not with the current free JPEG software . It 's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error . If you repeatedly compress and decompress , the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation output . ( It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change . ) One of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited , but I am not optimistic about it . In any case , the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg , at the original quality setting , would introduce no further loss . Even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation . ( If you 're wondering why , it 's because the pixel-block boundaries move . If you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels , you might be safe , but that 's a mighty limited capability ! ) The bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images , but you do n't want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps . Use a lossless format ( PPM , RLE , TIFF , etc ) while working on the image , then JPEG it when you are ready to file it away . Aside from avoiding degradation , you will save a lot of compression/decompression time this way : - ) . [ 14 ] What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG ? As stated earlier , you *will* lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing GIF image to JPEG . If you can obtain the original full-color data the GIF was made from , it 's far better to make a JPEG from that . But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from , here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality . The first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG , to make sure you are happy with it , before throwing away the corresponding GIF ; that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary . Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs , as explained in section 3 ; in particular , cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors do n't convert well . You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality will be *larger* than the GIF . ( So check the sizes too . ) Experience to date suggests that large , high-visual-quality GIFs are the best candidates for conversion to JPEG . They chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings , and they convert to JPEG with least degradation . Do n't waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes . Also , don't expect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created directly from full-color originals . To maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through JPEG files would be ( i.e. , shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file , not 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons ) . Many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color border around a GIF image . While useless , this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in GIF files . It is NOT free in JPEG files , and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts ( `` ghost '' edges ) . Do yourself a favor and crop off any border before JPEGing . ( If you are on an X Windows system , XV 's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this . ) cjpeg 's default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input , but for GIF inputs , Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation . ( If you apply smoothing as suggested below , the higher Q setting may not be necessary . ) Color GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually `` dithered '' to fool your eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store . If you enlarge the image , you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors ; at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value . The trouble with dithering is that , to JPEG , it looks like high-spatial-frequency color noise ; and JPEG ca n't compress noise very well . The resulting JPEG file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from JPEGing the original full color image ( if you had it ) . To get around this , you want to `` smooth '' the GIF image before compression . Smoothing averages together nearby pixels , thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway , and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give JPEG trouble . Appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high Q factor , thus further reducing the size of the compressed file , while still obtaining a better-looking output image than you 'd get without smoothing . With the V4 free JPEG software ( or products based on it ) , a simple smoothing capability is built in . Try `` -smooth 10 '' or so when converting GIFs . Values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs . Heavy-handed dithering may require larger smoothing factors . ( If you can see regular fine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement , then strong smoothing is definitely called for . ) Too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image , which you do n't want . If you are an image processing wizard , you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program , such as pnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package . However , cjpeg 's built-in smoother is a LOT faster than pnmconvol ... The upshot of all this is that `` cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10 '' is probably a good starting point for converting GIFs . But if you really care about the image , you 'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - For more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in particular , contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info @ uunet.uu.net . -- tom lane organizer , Independent JPEG Group Internet : tgl @ cs.cmu.edu BITNET : tgl % cs.cmu.edu @ carnegie

Okay we have figure out that a mission specifically to Pluto is to large and to expensive.. Okay what about launching one probe with multiple parts.. Kind of liek the old MIRV principle of old Cold War Days . Basically what I mean is design a mother ship that has piggy backed probes for different missions , namely different planets . Each probe would be tied in with the mother ship ( or earth as the case may be ) .. This is good when and if we go for Mars ( the MArs mission can act as either Mother ship or relay point for the probes . Also the mother ship would be powered ( if not the Mars Mission ) by a normal propulsion , but also a solar sail ( main reason for solar sail race is to see what can be done and autmoated ? ) the sail would get the probes to were they needed.. I know the asteroid/meteor clouds ( and such ) might get in the way of a Sail ? ? Main reasonf ro mother ship idea is to make it more economoical to send multiple probes/mission/satellites/exploreres to different places and cut costs.. The probes could do fly bys or ? ? we shall see ... == Michael Adams , nsmca @ acad3.alaska.edu -- I 'm not high , just jacked

It sounds as if you are proceeding with just the sort of obfuscation you have accused me of . I always preceeded my statements with `` it is my understanding that ... '' Now , I have made my claim clear with regard to the issue of both the Twelve Imams and with Khomeini 's supposed claim of infalibility . After hearing your seemingly more knowledgable claim that Khomeini made no such claim regarding himself , I have withdrawn that portion of my statement regarding that claim . However , I have received _no_ such response regarding the infallibility of the Twelve Imams . There is nothing obfuscationist about my claims , which are always made clearly . I have received no such clear response regarding the Twelve Imams but rather abstruse references to unusual metaphysical natures and other such opaque `` concepts '' often used by people to camoflage the baselessness of their positions , particularly in matters of theology . These are just the sorts of `` concepts '' used by Christian churches the perverting of their religion . > As salaam a-laikum Alaikum Wassalam , Gregg

The serial number will be in a 64 bit block , with a 34 bit filler . Doesn't take a lot to check to see if that is correct . Depends on whether the filler is a constant ( makes checking easy , but susceptible to replay ) , or variable ( e.g . timer , counter , random ) , which makes replay harder and can also make it easier for the inquisitors to know if they 've missed messages , or gotten them out of sequence , or other interesting things that sort of person might care about . It is still easy to conceal super-encryption , at least until the inquisitors get ahold of the K key , which can take a while , presumably not in near-real-time .

Free options The BEST option is XFree86 , which is an enhanced version of X386 1.2 . Any other version of X386 will have slower performance , and will be more difficult to compile . Information on how to obtain XFree86 is listed below . X386 is the port of the X11 server to System V/386 that was done by Thomas Roell ( roell @ sgcs.com ) . It supports a wide variety of SVGA boards . There are 2 major free versions : X386 1.1 is based on X11R4 , X386 1.2 is included in MIT 's X11R5 distribution ( ie . you do n't need to patch it into the MIT source any more ) . X386 1.3 is the current commercial offering from SGCS ( see below ) . 2 . Commercial options 1 ) Metro Link 2213 W.

II ) What is XFree86 and where do I get it ? 3 . What is XFree86 ? XFree86 is an enhanced version of X386 1.2 , which was distributed with X11R5 . This release consists of many bug fixes , speed improvements , and other enhancements . Here are the highlights of the enhancements : 1 ) The SpeedUp package from Glenn Lai is an integral part of XFree86 , selectable at run-time via the Xconfig file . Some SpeedUps require an ET4000 based SVGA , and others require a virtual screen width of 1024 . The SpeedUps suitable to the configuration are selected by default . With a high-quality ET4000 board ( VRAM ) , this can yield up to 40 % improvement of the xStones benchmark over X386 1.2 . 2 ) The fX386 packages from Jim Tsillas are included as the default operating mode if SpeedUp is not selected . This mode is now equivalent in performance to X386 1.1b ( X11R4 ) , and approximately 20 % faster than X386 1.2 . 3 ) Support for LOCALCONN , compile-time selectable for server , clients , or both . This support is for both SVR3.2 and SVR4 . For SVR4.0.4 with the 'Advanced Compatibility Package ' , local connections from SCO XSight/ODT clients are supported . 4 ) Drivers for ATI and Trident TVGA8900C and TVGA9000 SVGA chipsets . Refer to the files README.ati and README.trident for details about the ATI and Trident drivers . 5 ) Support for compressed bitmap fonts has been added ( Thomas Eberhardt's code from the contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu ) . 6 ) Type1 Font code from MIT contrib tape has been included , and is compile-time selectable . There are contributed Type1 fonts in the contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu . 7 ) New configuration method which allows the server 's drivers and font renderers to be reconfigured from both source and binary distributions . 8 ) Integrated support for 386BSD , Mach , and Linux . 9 ) A monochrome version of the server which will run on generic VGA cards is now included . The following key features were added with the release of XFree86 1.2 ( they were not in XFree86 1.1 ) : 1 ) The monochrome server has been enhanced to do bank-switching of available SVGA memory to allow virtual screens up to 1600x1200 ( see the X386 ( 1 ) manual page for more information ) . 2 ) Support for the Hercules mono card has been added to the monochrome server , and with it the ability to support a `` two headed '' server - one VGA , and one Hercules . So far this has only been tested on SVR4 ( it is also reported to work under Linux ) . 3 ) SVR3 shared libraries , tested under ISC SVR3 2.2 and 3.0.1 . 4 ) Support for SVR4.2 ( There are some special considerations to consider , due to new USL bugs ; see the README.SVR4 file for more information . ) 5 ) Support for PS/2 mice , and Logitech MouseMan/TrackMan ( some versions of these devices were not previously compatible ) . 6 ) A new tutorial on how to develop correct video card and monitor timing data , written by Eric Raymond ( derived from previous documentation and a lot of experimentation ) . 7 ) Greatly improved support for international keyboards , including implementation of the Compose key functionality found on many vendor servers ( see the X386keybd ( 1 ) manual page for more information ) . 8 ) The accuracy with which the server detects SVGA pixel clocks has been improved , and the timings are now stored at accuracies of 0.1 MHz . Users may want to consider removing an existing Clocks line from their Xconfig file and re-probing using the new server . 9 ) Many enhancements in error handling and parsing of the Xconfig configuration file . Error messages are much more informative and intuitive , and more validation is done . There are many new options that can be enabled in the Xconfig file ( see the X386 ( 1 ) manual page for more information on the format of this file ) . Plus a number of other small things . Refer to the CHANGELOG file in the source distribution for full details . Also included are a tutorial on monitor timing by Eric Raymond , and the current X386 mode database and a sample xdm configuration by David Wexelblat . 4 . What OSs are supported ? XFree86 supports : SVR4.2 : Consensys V4.2 SVR4.0 : Microport , Dell , Esix , ISC , AT & T , MST , Consensys , UHC SVR3 : ISC 2.2 & 3.0 , AT & T 2.2 Linux , Mach 386 , 386BSD 0.1 BSD/386 is not supported , but it should work . The most active BSD/386 person is Greg Lehey < grog @ lemis.de > . Note that Esix 3.2D and SCO are not supported yet , but anyone should feel free to submit patches . If you are interested in tackling this , send mail to xfree86 @ physics.su.oz.au 5 . What video hardware is supported ? At this time , XFree86 1.2 supports the following SVGA chipsets : Tseng ET4000 Tseng ET3000 Paradise PVGA1 Western Digital WD90C00 , WD90C10 , WD90C11 ( these are supersets of the PVGA1 , and use its driver ) Genoa GVGA Trident TVGA8900C , TVGA9000 ATI 18800 , 28800 All of the above are supported in both 256 color and monochrome modes , with the exception of the ATI chipsets , which are only supported in 256 color mode . The monochrome server also supports generic VGA cards , using 64k of video memory in a single bank , and the Hercules card . On the ET3000 , only 64k of video memory is supported for the monochrome server , and the GVGA has not been tested with more than 64k . It appears that some of the SVGA card manufacturers are going to non-traditional mechanisms for selecting pixel-clock frequencies . To avoid having to modify the server to accommodate these schemes XFree86 1.2 adds support for using an external program to select the pixel clock . This allows programs to be written as new mechanisms are discovered . Refer to the README.clkprog file for information on how these programs work , if you need to write one . If you do develop such a program , the XFree86 team would be interested in including it with future XFree86 releases . If you are purchasing new hardware for the purpose of using XFree86 , it is suggested that you purchase an ET4000-based board such as the Orchid ProDesigner IIs . Avoid recent Diamond boards ; XFree86 will not work with them , because Diamond wo n't provide programming details . In fact , the XFree86 project is actively not supporting new Diamond products , as long as such policies remain in effect . Contributions of code will NOT be accepted ( because of the potential liabilities ) . If you would like to see this change , tell Diamond about it . Some people have asked if XFree86 would work with local bus or EISA video cards . Theoretically , the means of communication between the CPU and the video card is irrelevant to Xfree86 compatibility . It could be ISA , EISA , or local bus . What should matter is the chipset on the video card . Unfortunately , the developers do n't have a lot of access to EISA or VLB machines , so this is largely an untested theory . However , we have yet to see any reports of things not working on one of these buses and we have several reports of Xfree86 working fine on them . 6 . What about accelerated boards ? At this time , there is no support in XFree86 for accelerated boards like the S3 , ATI Ultra ( 8514/A ) , TIGA , etc . This support is available in commercial products from SGCS and MetroLink ( for SVR3 and SVR4 ) . An S3 server is available for 386BSD and Linux . Contact < hasty @ netcom.com > for 386BSD or < jon @ robots.ox.ac.uk > for Linux . A beta 8514/A server is available for Linux . Contact < martin @ cs.unc.edu > or < jon @ robots.ox.ac.uk > . Note : these servers are NOT part of XFree86 . 7 . Why does n't XFree86 support 16-color VGA modes ? The reason that this is not supported is the way VGA implements the 16-color modes . In 256-color modes , each byte of frame buffer memory contains 1 pixel . But the 16-color modes are implemented as bit- planes . Each byte of frame- buffer memory contains 1 bit from each of each of 8 pixels , and there are four such planes . The MIT frame- buffer code is not designed to deal with this . If VGA handled 16-color modes by packing 2 4-bit pixels into each byte , the MIT code could be modified to support this ( or it already may ; I 'm not sure ) . But for the VGA way of doing things , a complete new frame-buffer implementation is required . Some beta testers are looking into this , but nothing is yet available from the project . 8 . What other hardware or software requirements are there ? Obviously , a supported SVGA board and OS are required . To run X efficiently , 12-16MB of memory should be considered a minimum . The various binary releases take 10-40MB of disk space , depending on the OS ( e.g . whether or not it supports shared libraries ) . To build from sources , at least 80MB of free disk space will be required , although 120MB should be considered a comfortable lower bound . 9 . Where can I get source for XFree86 ? Source patches for the current version ( 1.2 , based on X11R5 PL22 from MIT ) , are available via anonymous FTP from : export.lcs.mit.edu ( under /contrib/XFree86 ) ftp.physics.su.oz.au ( under /XFree86 ) ftp.win.tue.nl ( under /pub/XFree86 ) ( For the rest of this FAQ , these 3 location will be called $ FTP ) Refer to the README file under the specified directory for information on which files you need to get to build your distribution . 10 . Where can I get binaries for XFree86 ? Binaries are available via anonymous FTP from : ftp.physics.su.oz.au - SVR4 binaries under /XFree86/SVR4 ftp.win.tue.nl - SVR4 binaries under /pub/XFree86/SVR4 ferkel.ucsb.edu - SVR4 binaries under /pub/SVR4/XFree86 stasi.bradley.edu - SVR4 binaries under /pub/XFree86/SVR4 blancmange.ma.utexas.edu - SVR3 ( ISC ) binaries under /pub/ISC ftp.prz.tu-berlin.de - SVR3 ( ISC ) binaries under /pub/pc/isc/XFree86 tsx-11.mit.edu - Linux binaries under /pub/linux/packages/X11 agate.berkeley.edu - 386BSD binaries under /pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86 ftp.cs.uwm.edu - Mach binaries under /i386 Ensure that you are getting XFree86 1.2 - some of these sites may archive older releases as well . Each binary distribution will contain a README file that describes what files you need to take from the archive , and which compile-time option selections were made when building the distribution . IV ) What general things should I know about running XFree86 ? 11 . Installation directories The top-level installation directory is specified by the ProjectRoot ( /usr/X386 , by default ) variable in config/site.def . Binaries , include files , and libraries are installed in $ ProjectRoot/ { bin , include , lib } . This can be changed when rebuilding from sources , and can be modified via symbolic links for those OSs that support them . This directory is nonstandard , and was chosen this way to allow XFree86 to be installed alongside a commercial/vendor-supplied X implementation . 12 . Configuration files The XFree86 server reads a configuration file ( `` Xconfig '' ) on startup . The search path , contents and syntax for this file are documented in the server manpage , which should be consulted before asking questions . 13 . Determining VGA dot clocks and monitor modes David E Wexelblat ( dwex @ mtgzfs3.att.com ) maintains a database of known clock settings for VGA cards and monitor settings . The database is installed in /usr/X386/lib/X11/etc/modeDB.txt , and is in the source tree under mit/server/ddx/x386/etc . This database is also available from him ( for the latest copy ) , and is kept on export.lcs.mit.edu in ~/contrib/X386.modeDB.Z , which is updated occasionally . Obtain a copy of this database . It just might have the settings you need . If you create new settings , please send them to David for inclusion in the database . If this does n't help you , the VideoModes.doc ( by Eric Raymond ) file with XFree86 contains tutorials on how to come up with these timings . It may be helpful to start with settings that almost work , and use this description to get them right . When you do , send the information to David Wexelblat for inclusion in the database . NOTE : The old 'clock.exe ' program is not supported any more , and is completely unnecessary . If you need to determine dot clock values for a new board , remove the 'Clocks ' line from your Xconfig file ( if present ) , and start the server . The server will probe for clocks itself and print them out . You can use these values to put a 'Clocks ' line into your Xconfig file , which is not necessary , but will speed up starting the server in the future . 14 . Rebuilding/reconfiguring the server from the link kit If you have installed the server Binary Link Kit , it is possible to reconfigure the drivers and font renderers in the server . This is fully explained in the README file that is available with the link kit . V ) What OS-specific things should I know about running XFree86 ? First of all , the server must be installed suid-root ( mode 4755 ) . 15 . SVR4 Why wo n't my xterm run properly ? If your kernel is not built with the consem module , you should define CONSEM=no in you environment . Otherwise xterm wo n't run . csh users should use 'setenv CONSEM no' The Esix console driver patch 403019 is known to cause keymapping problems with XFree86 . It recommended that this patch not be installed . Alternatively they keymap can be fixed with xmodmap . 16 . SVR3 Make sure you look at $ FTP/README.ISC , if that 's what you are running . 17 . 386BSD Make sure you look at $ FTP/README.386BSD . Also , a separate 386BSD FAQ is maintained by Richard Murphey < Rich @ Rice.edu > . The latest version should be available in the file XFree86-1.2-386BSD-FAQ at the following ftp sites : agate.berkeley.edu : /pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2 wuarchive.wustl.edu : /mirrors4/386bsd/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2 grasp1.univ-lyon1.fr : pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2 18 . Linux You must be running Linux 0.97pl4 or greater , and have the 4.1 gcc jump libraries installed . Make sure the binaries X386 , X386mono , xload and xterm are setuid root . If your kernel does n't have TCP support compiled in , you 'll have to run the server as `` X -pn '' . The default startup configuration assumes that TCP is not available . If it is , change the two files /usr/X386/bin/startx and /usr/X386/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers , removing the -pn argument to X386 . Make sure /dev/console is either a link to /dev/tty0 or has the major number 4 , minor number 0 . Also note that if /dev/console is not owned by the user running X , then xconsole and xterm will not permit console output redirection . Xdm will properly change the owner , but startx wo n't . When running xdm from rc.local , you will need to provide it with a tty , for example `` xdm < /dev/console & '' . For more detailed information , please read the file README present with the distribution on tsx-11.mit.edu . 19 . Mach Make sure you look at $ FTP/README.Mach . VI ) What things should I know for building XFree86 from source ? This section has been removed from the FAQ , since it is fully explained in $ FTP/README and the OS-specific READMEs . Please look at those files for information on building XFree86 . VII ) Is there anything special about building clients with XFree86 ? 20 . BSD compatibility library A lot of clients make use of BSD functions like bcopy ( ) , etc . The default configuration files are set up to link with libXbsd.a which contains emulation for bcopy ( ) , bzero ( ) , bcmp ( ) , ffs ( ) , random ( ) , seed ( ) . A better way of providing the ' b ' functions is to include < X11/Xfuncs.h > in source files that call them . Xfuncs.h provides macro definitions for these in terms of the SYSV 'mem ' functions . If you are linking with a vendor supplied library which calls some of these functions , then you should link with libXbsd.a 21 . ANSICCOPTIONS This is something that was added to allow a developer to get rid of the ANSI-ness defined in the default CCOPTIONS without having to rewrite the entire CCOPTIONS line . For example , with stock MIT , you 'd see something like CCOPTIONS= '' -ansi -O2 -fwritable-strings '' and to get rid of the ANSI-ness , the developer would have to put CCOPTIONS= '' -O2 -fwritable-strings '' in his Imakefile . With this change , you would see a default of ANSICCOPTIONS= '' -ansi '' CCOPTIONS= '' -O2 -fwritable-strings '' and all the developer would have to put in the Imakefile is : ANSICCOPTIONS= to get rid of the ANSI-ness ( many X clients will die a horrible death with -ansi ) . The effect is even more dramatic in practice , because CCOPTIONS is actually quite complex . The other issue is that one must add 'ANSICCOPTIONS= $ ( ANSICCOPTIONS ) ' to a PassCDebugFlags definition .

The Detroit area picks up Hockey Night in Canada from CBC ( ch 9 ) in Windsor where we see Don Cherry 's Coaches Corner between periods . We also get to see Don Cherry 's Grapevine just before the game . The Grapevine is a hockey talk show where Don talks to a player or coach about what else : Hockey . It 's actually a pretty good show and Don is n't as annoying as he is on Coaches Corner . I think this is were Don got his nickname 'Grapes ' but I 'm not sure . Don use to coach the Boston Bruins . I do n't know exactly when that was . Could someone fill me in on this info ? A local radio station here in Detroit ( WLLZ ) talks to Don every Tuesday morning . Personally , I 've had my fill of Donny ! He really pisses me off sometimes . During the Detroit-Toronto game Monday night on CBC , Don gave high praise to Doug Gilmour , saying he was a two-way player and not just a designated goal scorer and that he is probably the best player in the game because of that . That 's fine and I agree that Gilmour is a good two-way player BUT he said the EXACT same thing about Yzerman about a month ago on a local radio talk show . What gives ? It seems like he just has a set speech that he changes when he goes from city to city . Don Cherry : ' I think < insert star player name for city that he is in > is the best two-way player in the league today . ' There have been other times ( ca n't remember exactly what he said ) that he basically changed his opinions to match the audience he was talking to . Someone here on the net said something about how Don criticized Mario Lemieux but when the time comes for Don to broadcast the Cup playoffs from the Civic Center ( Yes , I think the Pens will make it out of the Wales Conference ) Don will apologize left and right for his remarks about Lemieux . In my opinion , he is an ass . And I wo n't change my opinion if I 'm in a different city . Sorry , if this did n't answer your question better but I just had to get this off my chest .

I 'd be willing to bet that a majority of the cost difference could be accounted for by the AF 's requirement for superfluous 2167 documentation , 5 or 6 huge requirements and design reviews , travel expenses flying personnel around to meetings , and over specifying the hardware . I doubt that the actual fabrication cost in materials and labor would be very different from SDIO 's costs . Of course , this is my cynical opinion based on years of watching the government procurement process try to cover up a lack of creativity and innovation with reams of documentation . ; )

If you are referring to the terms `` effeminate '' and `` homosexuals '' in the above passage , I agree that the accuracy of the translation has been challenged . However , I was simply commenting on the charge that it is an `` incredibly perverse '' interpretation to read this as a condemnation of homosexuality . Such a charge seems to imply that no reasonable person would ever conclude from the verse that Paul intended to condemn homosexuality ; however , I think I can see how a reasonable person might very well take this view of the verse . Therefore I do not believe it is `` incredibly perverse '' to read it in this way . > I think your argument from fornication is circular . Why is > homosexuality wrong ? Because it 's fornication .

After all , a couple does n't have to be married by a minister . A secular justice of the peace could do the job , and the two people would be married . My point was that it is easy to find a biblical basis for heterosexual marriage , but where in the Bible would one get a Christian marriage between two people of the same sex ? And if you do see a biblical basis for same-sex marriages , how willing would gay Christians be to '' save themselves '' for such a marriage and to never have sexual intercourse with anyone outside of that marriage relationship ? Please note that I am not trying to imply that gay Christians would not be willing to be so monogamous , I am genuinely interested in hearing opinions on the subject . I have heard comments from gays in the past that lead me to believe they regard promiscuity as one of the main points of being homosexual , yet I tend to doubt that gays who want to be Christian would advocate such a position . So what is the gay view ? - Mark [ Yes , I agree that a reasonable person might conclude that Paul is condemning homosexuality . I was responding to certain details of your posting .

Some Christians debated > with me whether Christianity leaves any room for reasoning . I claimed > rationality is quelled out of Christianity by faith and dogma . Again , this should really be evaluated at a personal level . For example , there was only one Jesus ( presumably ) , and he probably did n't say all that many things , and yet ( seemingly ) billions and billions of Christian sects have arisen . Perhaps there is one that is totally dedicated to rationalism and believes in Christ as in pantheism . It would seem to go against the Bible , but it is amazing what people come up with under the guise of `` personal interpretation '' . > A philosopher can not be a Christian because a philosopher can change his mind , > whereas a Christian can not , due to the nature of faith and dogma present > in any religion . This is a good point . We have here the quintessential Christian : he sets up a system of values/beliefs for himself , which work very well , and every event/experience is understandable and deablable within the framework of this system . However , we also have an individual who has the inability ( at least not without some difficulty ) to change , which is important , because the problem with such a system is the same as with any system : one can not be open minded to the point of `` testing hypotheses '' against the basic premise of the system without destroying whatever faith is invested therein , unless of course , all the tests fail . In other words , the *fairer* way would be to test and evaluate moralities without the bias/responsibility of losing/retaining a system . > > I claimed that a `` Christian philosopher '' is not a Christian , > but is a person whose beliefs at the moment correspond with those > of Christianity .

From : daveb @ pogo.wv.tek.com ( Dave Butler ) Subject : Objectivity ( was : After 2000 years ... ) Organization : Tektronix , Inc. , Wilsonville , OR . Lines : 83 This discussion on `` objective '' seems to be falling into solipsism ( Eg : the recent challenge from Frank Dwyer , for someone to prove that he can actually observe phenomena ) . Someones even made the statement that science is '' subjective '' and that even atom are `` subjective . '' This is getting a bit silly and the word `` objective '' is losing all meaning . Lets start by remembering the definition of `` objective '' which has been already presented : objective ADJ . 1 . Of or having to do with a material object as distinguished from a mental concept . 2 . Having actual existence . 3.a . Unenfluenced by emotion or personal prejudice . b . Based on observable phenomenon . The Objectivity of a thing is not based on whether everyone agrees on that thing ( eg : the world is objectively round , regardless of the fact that there exist flat earthers ) , but rather whether it is based observable and verifiable phenomenon ( instead of being based solely on peoples wishes , feeling , mental processes , etc ) . Thus atoms , being based on very observable and repeatable phenomenon , are indeed considered to be objective rather than subjective . Even weird , high energy physics is based on observable phenomenon ( even though that observation can change the outcome ) . Nor are those observable phenomenon affected by emotion , or personal prejudice ( eg : chemical reactions do not change to the whims of different people ) . Thus to say that science is not objective ( ie : objectively verifiable ) is a bit silly , as that is the point of science . Now I will agree that science is not objectively `` good ; '' I will not thereby conclude though that science is not objective . Now some examples things which are `` objective '' : A D-12 tractor is larger than the average breadbox . Chlorophyll is green . Seawater contains salt . There exists ozone in the atmosphere ( at least presently ) . Ozone blocks ultraviolet light . Ultraviolet light increases the incidents of skin Cancer . `` Good '' on the other hand is a value judgement . It does n't seem to have an existence apart from what we give it ( unless someone can objectively show the existence of an omnipotent entity which has defined `` good '' ) . We can not quantify it , touch it or collect it in any concrete sense ( eg : I have a bag full of `` good '' ) . Now we do sometimes attempt to give the word `` good '' an objective meaning , e.g . `` good '' has been used to denote strength , resiliency , speed , etc . That though , is a subjective definition , as some might not see '' strength '' and etc , as necessarily `` good '' ( eg : strength inspired by Naziism is not generally viewed as `` good '' ) . As to a morality , I can not say that I have ever seen a morality strictly based on verifiable observable phenomenon . The closest I have seen is some form of the `` Golden Rule , '' which concludes that it is best not to deliberately piss people off , as they will likely then involve themselves in your life , in a manner you wo n't like . This is verifiable ; when you `` get in someone 's face , '' they will often retaliate . Another objective fact about morality is that a more powerful group can enforce their morality on a weaker group , and thus can at times , ignore that form of the `` Golden Rule '' without fear of reprisal . Now as to whether this enforcing of morality is `` good '' or `` bad , '' is quite subjective . By the way , remember that subjective does not mean that a thing can not be formally stated , or even commonly agreed upon ; it only means that that it is not verifiable from observable phenomena , or has a physical existence unto itself . Also note that I have not stated that there is no such thing as an objective morality , or that I could not accept any such a morality ; I have simply stated that I have seen no evidence of any such morality . One other thing to notice , `` objective '' is many times used as synonymous with '' true '' and/or `` absolute , '' and `` subjective '' sometimes has the connotation of '' false '' and/or `` relative . '' Tai n't necessarily so . For instance , when a conclusion is based on objective , but insufficient evidence , then it can be both objective and false . As to `` absolute , '' it is easy to note that while we can objectively show that TNT is explosive , but that does not absolutely mean that all TNT will explode , and thus objective is not necessarily absolute either . On the other hand , something subjective can also be either '' absolutist , '' or `` true . '' For instance , there are some theists who are specifically `` absolutist '' in their morality , even though they have only subjective evidence to back it up . Further , many a scientist and detective has been motivated by subjective reasons ( eg : a `` gut feeling '' or `` hunch '' ) , to investigate a phenomena or situation , and gather the objective evidence necessary to support a true hypothesis . On the whole though , I would have to agree that objective evidence is much more trustworthy than subjective evidence . Later , Dave Butler In starting any thesis , it seems to me , one should put forward as one's point of departure something incontrovertible ; the expression should be simple and dignified . Diogenes

I recently watched a an episode of `` The Old West '' a TV show on the Discovery Channel ( or perhaps the A & E Network ) , the one hosted by Kenny Rogers . This episode was all about the Mormons and how they settled Utah , etc . A large portion of the broadcast was about the `` Mountain Meadows Massacre '' . The program very specifically pointed out that Brigham Young knew nothing about the incident until long after it had happened ( before telegraph ) , and it occured as a result of several men inciting a bunch of paronoid Moromn settlers into what amounted to a mob . All participants in the incident were prosecuted and eccomunicated from the LDS Church . I suggest you watch a rerun of that episode ( they play them over and over ) and see what they ( non-Mormons ) have to say about it .

Well , GIF stands for Graphics Interchange Format and was put forth by Compuserve back in 1987 ( ? ) or so . It was to create a format that could be read and displayed by any system . GIF is limited to 8 bit color but has a built in compression scheme ( LZW ? ) . IFF is not really a graphics format , but rather a standard way to package images , sounds , animations , text , or whatever into one file . IFF was created by Electronic Arts , I do believe ( I could be wrong ) , for the Amiga . It was quickly adopted as pretty much the standard file format for the Amiga . The most common image format for the IFF package is an ILBM ( InterLeaved BitMap ? ) but many others exist . This format supports 24 bit color images . Information on both of these and many more are available via anonymous ftp at zamenhof.cs.rice.edu in the directory /pub/graphics.formats ( Taken from the FAQ for this news group . ) : ) Wayne Rigby rigby @ cs.unr.edu

My > computer is a DTK 286-12 IBM clone . Simple . First , Andrew is correct , although I can see where there might be some confusion . It is indeed possible to have two cards *configured* to use the same interrupt . They can not *share* the interrupt in the sense that it is not possible to have both cards active at the same time . Here is an example . For some time , I was short of `` free interrupts . '' I had a tape controller ( not a `` floppy tape '' ) that needed one of IRQ0-IRQ7 . ( It 's an *old* tape drive . ) My solution was to use IRQ3 ( also used for COM2 , where my modem is ) . I did this because I reasoned I would never be using the modem and the tape simultaneously . When kermit runs , it installs its own interrupt handler for IRQ3 and uses the serial port . If the tape drive were to generate an interrupt , kermit would not have a clue what to do with/for the tape controller . ( And since the tape controller would not be serviced , it would most likely `` hang . '' ) Likewise , when the tape backup software runs , it installs an interrupt handler for IRQ3 . That handler wo n't do anything for the serial port . Under DOS , printing is NOT interrupt-driven . Instead , the BIOS polls the status of the parallel port to determine when another byte may be sent . That 's why you can have your sound card and LPT1 both configured to use IRQ7 . Try that on NT and see how far you 'll get . : - ) -- Kenneth R. Ballou VOICE : ( 617 ) 494-0990 Oberon Software , Inc.

From : mauritz_c @ spcvxb.spc.edu Subject : Weird problem with GM 4-banger transmission Organization : SPC Community Access System Lines : 34 I 'm having an interesting problem with my girlfriend 's car . Before I delve into its innards , I thought I 'd check `` net.wisdom '' on the subject . : ) It 's a 1985 Buick Skyhawk ( I know ... I know ) 2.0l EFI 4-banger auto 35k miles When I drive tha car long enough to get it hot ( especially at highways speeds ) the transmission has this nasty habit of getting `` stuck '' in 3rd gear . As a result , when you stop for a light the motor stalls . Putting the car in park , and waiting for 30-60 seconds before restarting sometimes allows the transmission to `` reset '' and go back into 1st . Otherwise , it just stalls when put in drive . My thoughts : Either it the 3rd gear band is binding and getting stuck when it gets hot ( not so likely ) or perhaps the lock-up converter is not disengaging properly ( seems likely ) . The least likely ( keeping fingers crossed ) is that some critical vacuum hose has broken/cracked and this behaviour is due to lack of vaccuum somewhere ( as used to happen with old modulator valves ) . My background is that my father owns a service station and I worked there on and off from 10-19 years of age . Please feel free to be as technical as you want . : ) I 'd appreciate hearing any tips/suggestions/offers of free beer . < grin > Skoal , Chris

Sorry , but the following western scholars are forced to disagree with you . During the First World War and the ensuing years - 1914-1920 , the Armenians through a premeditated and systematic genocide , tried to complete its centuries-old policy of annihilation against the Turks and Kurds by savagely murdering 2.5 million Muslims and deporting the rest from their 1,000 year homeland .

All pieces are available for anonymous ftp from rtfm.mit.edu ( 18.172.1.27 ) in the directory pub/usenet/news.answers/macintosh . Except for this introductory FAQ which appears in multiple newsgroups and is stored as general-faq.Z , the name of each file has the format of the last part of the group name followed by `` -faq.Z '' , e.g the FAQ for comp.sys.mac.system is stored as system-faq.Z and the FAQ for comp.sys.mac.misc is stored as misc-faq.Z . RTFM stores files as compressed ( .Z ) BINARY files . If you leave off the .Z at the end of the file name when `` getting '' the file , rtfm will automatically decompress the file before sending it to you . You can also have these files mailed to you by sending an E-mail message to mail-server @ rtfm.mit.edu with the line : send pub/usenet/news.answers/macintosh/ '' name '' in the body text where `` name '' is the name of the file you want as specified above ( e.g . general-faq ) . You can also send this server a message with the subject `` help '' for more detailed instructions . ==================== I HAVE A QUESTION ... ( 1.0 ) ==================== Congratulations ! You 've come to the right place . Usenet is a wonderful resource for information ranging from basic questions ( How do I lock a floppy disk ? ) to queries that would make Steve Jobs himself run screaming from the room in terror . ( I used ResEdit to remove resources Init # 11 , WDEF 34 , and nVIR 17 from my system file and used the Hex Editor to add code string # A67B45 as a patch to the SFGetFile routine so the Standard File Dialog Box would be a nice shade of mauve . Everything worked fine until I installed SuperCDevBlaster , and now when I use the Aldus driver to print from PageMaker 5.0d4 to a Linotronic 6000 my system hangs . P.S . I 'm running System 6.0.2 on a PowerBook 170 . ) Since the Macintosh newsgroups are medium to high volume , we ask that you first peruse this FAQ list including at least the table of contents for the other pieces of it , check any other relevant on-line resources listed below in question 1.2 , especially the FAQ lists for the other Macintosh newsgroups , and RTFM ( Read the Friendly Manual ) before posting your question . We realize that you are personally incensed that the System is taking up fourteen of your newly-installed twenty megs of RAM , but this question has already made its way around the world three hundred times before , and it 's developing tired feet . Finally , before posting to any newsgroup ( Macintosh or otherwise ) , please familiarize yourself with the basic etiquette of Usenet as described in the newsgroup news.announce.newusers . HOW DO I USE THIS DOCUMENT ? WHERE CAN I GET IT ? ( 1.1 ) comp.sys.mac.faq is currently divided into multiple pieces , a general introduction which you 're reading now , and specific lists for the newsgroups comp.sys.mac.system and comp.sys.mac.misc . FAQ lists for comp.sys.mac.wanted , comp.sys.mac.apps and comp.sys.mac.hardware are in development . When ready each part will be available in its respective newsgroup . All pieces are available via anonymous ftp from rtfm.mit.edu in the pub/usenet/news.answers/macintosh directory . Except for this document itself which is named general-faq.Z the pieces are named as per the last part of the newsgroup they cover followed by `` -faq '' , e.g . system-faq.Z , misc-faq.Z . The .Z means the file is stored compressed so you 'll need to ftp it in binary mode and use either MacCompress , StuffIt Deluxe , or the UNIX uncompress command to decompress it . However if you leave off the `` .Z '' extension when you `` get '' the file , rtfm will automatically decompress the file before sending it to you . This introductory document is posted to all of the concerned newsgroups . The tables of contents for each of the specific FAQ lists are at the beginning of this file so you should be able to get at least some idea whether your question is answered anywhere else in the FAQ even if you do n't have the other parts at hand . It 's not always obvious , especially to newcomers , where a particular question or comment should be posted . Please familiarize yourself with the FAQ lists in all the major Macintosh newsgroups before posting in any of them . Which questions appear in which FAQs can serve as a basic guide to what posts belong where . To jump to a particular question search for section-number.question-number enclosed in parentheses . For example to find `` Where can I FTP Macintosh software ? '' search for the string `` ( 2.1 ) '' . To jump to a section instead of a question use a zero for the question number . WHAT OTHER INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE ? ( 1.2 ) comp.sys.mac.faq provides short answers to a number of frequently asked questions appropriate for the Usenet newsgroup comp.sys.mac.misc and comp.sys.mac.system . Four other files are worthy of particular note : Daryl Spitzer maintains a FAQ list covering Macintosh programming for the newsgroup comp.sys.mac.programmer . It 's posted to that group weekly and available for anonymous ftp from ftp.cs.uoregon ( 128.223.8.8 ) in /pub/mac . Eric Rosen maintains a frequently asked questions list for comp.sys.mac.comm available in that newsgroup and from rascal.ics.utexas.edu in mac/faq ( where the file you 're reading now is also irregularly archived ) . This list answers many frequently asked questions about networking , UNIX and the Mac , telecommunications , and foreign file formats . Norm Walsh has compiled an excellent FAQ for comp.fonts that answers a lot of questions about the various kinds of fonts and cross-platform conversion and printing . It 's available in comp.fonts or by ftp from ibis.cs.umass.edu in /pub/norm/comp.fonts/FAQ* . Finally Jim Jagielski maintains a FAQ for comp.unix.aux covering Apple 's UNIX environment , A/UX . It 's posted every 2 to 3 weeks in comp.unix.aux and news.answers . It 's available for anonymous ftp at jagubox.gsfc.nasa.gov . WHICH NEWSGROUP SHOULD I POST TO ? ( 1.3 ) There are no stupid questions , but there are misplaced ones . You would n't ask your English teacher how to do the definite integral of ln x between zero and one , would you ? So do n't ask the programmer newsgroup why your system is so slow when Microsoft Word is in the background . Ignorance of basic netiquette is not an excuse . If you want people to help you , you need to learn their ways of communicating . Posting questions to the proper newsgroup will fill your mailbox with pearls of wisdom ( and maybe a few rotten oysters too : - ) ) . Posting to the wrong newsgroup often engenders a thundering silence . For instance the most common and glaring mispost , one that seems as incongruous to dwellers in the Macintosh regions of Usenet as would a purple elephant to Aleuts in the Arctic , asking a question about networking anywhere except comp.sys.mac.comm , normally produces no useful responses . Posting the same question to comp.sys.mac.comm ensures that your post is read and considered by dozens of experienced network administrators and not a few network software designers . Please post to exactly ONE newsgroup . Do not cross-post . If a question is n't important enough for you to take the extra minute to figure out where it properly belongs , it 's not important enough for several thousand people to spend their time reading . For the same reason comp.sys.mac.misc should not be used as a catch-all newsgroup . The breakdown of questions between different newsgroups in this document can also serve as a reasonable guide to what belongs where . Specifically questions about productivity applications ( software you bought your Macintosh to run , not software you bought to make your Macintosh run better ) should go to comp.sys.mac.apps unless the application is covered in a more specific newsgroup . Communications programs , games , HyperCard , compilers and databases all have more topical comp.sys.mac . * newsgroups . Post questions about non-communications hardware including questions about what software is necessary to make particular hardware work to comp.sys.mac.hardware . Questions about MacOS system software belong in comp.sys.mac.system . Questions about utilities and extensions normally belong in comp.sys.mac.misc . Questions about A/UX go to comp.unix.aux . Detailed questions about Appletalk belong in comp.protocols.appletalk . Direct questions about HyperCard to comp.sys.mac.hypercard . Non-HyperCard programming questions and questions about development environments should go to comp.sys.mac.programmer . ResEdit questions may be posted either to comp.sys.mac.misc , comp.sys.mac.system , or comp.sys.mac.programmer ; but generally the netters who inhabit the darker recesses of comp.sys.mac.programmer are considerably more practiced at the art of resource hacking . A general exception to the above rules is that any VERY technical question about an application that actually begins to delve into the how 's of a program as well as the what 's ( Recent example : How does WriteNow which is written entirely in assembly compare to other word processors written in high level languages ? ) might be better addressed to the programmer newsgroup . For Sale and Want to Buy posts should go to comp.sys.mac.wanted and misc.forsale.computers.mac ONLY . We understand that you 're desperate to sell your upgraded 128K Mac to get the $ $ for a PowerBook 180 ; but trust me , anyone who wants to buy it will be reading comp.sys.mac.wanted . Political and religious questions ( The Mac is better than Windows ! Is not ! Is too ! Is not ! Is too ! Hey ! How 'bout the Amiga ! What about it ? Is Not ! Is too ! ) belong in comp.sys.mac.advocacy . Anything not specifically mentioned above probably belongs in comp.sys.mac.misc . Finally do n't be so provincial as to consider only the comp.sys.mac newsgroups the appropriate forums for your questions . Many questions about modems in comp.sys.mac.comm are much more thoroughly discussed in comp.dcom.modems . Questions about Mac MIDI are often better handled in comp.music even though it 's not a Macintosh specific newsgroup . Shop around . Usenet 's a big place and not everything relevant to the Macintosh happens in comp.sys.mac . 4 . SOMEONE JUST ASKED WHY THE SYSTEM WAS TAKING UP SIXTEEN OF THEIR TWENTY MEGABYTES OF RAM . SHOULD N'T I PUT MY BRILLIANCE AND WIT ON DISPLAY FOR THE WORLD BY POSTING THE SEVENTEENTH RESPONSE ? No . Frequent answers are just as boring and uninteresting as frequent questions . Unless you really have something new to add to the traditional answers ( such as the recent discovery that fonts in System 7.1 could eat memory ) private E-mail is a much better medium for answering common questions like this one . You might want to add a mention of this FAQ in your E-mail response and a polite suggestion that your correspondent read it before posting future questions . I do read all the newsgroups covered here and have written a small script in MicroPhone II that lets me send PWFAQ 's ( people with frequently asked questions ) the section of this document that answers their question with just the click of a button so please do n't feel obligated to respond to someone who cares so little about the answer to their question they ca n't be troubled to read the FAQ list to get it . === FTP ( 2.0 ) === WHERE CAN I FTP MAC SOFTWARE ? ( 2.1 ) The three major North American Internet archives of shareware , freeware , and demo software are sumex-aim.stanford.edu ( 36.44.0.6 ) , mac.archive.umich.edu ( 141.211.165.41 ) , and wuarchive.wustl.edu ( 128.252.135.4 ) which mirrors the other two sites and several others . Wuarchive often holds on to files after other sites remove them for space concerns , and still has files that were deleted from the formerly important site , rascal.ics.utexas.edu . Rascal was notable for storing its files in MacBinary format rather than the less efficient BinHex format common at the other archives . Unless otherwise noted shareware and freeware mentioned in this document should be available at the above sites . To keep traffic on the Internet manageable , Scandinavians should try connecting to ftp.funet.fi ( 128.214.6.100 ) , ftp.lth.se ( 130.235.20.3 ) , or sics.se ( 192.16.123.90 ) instead . Those in the U.K. should look first at src.doc.ic.ac.uk ( 146.169.2.1 ) . Continental Europeans can try nic.switch.ch ( 130.59.1.40 ) , ezinfo.ethz.ch ( 129.132.2.72 ) , and anl.anl.fr ( 192.54.179.1 ) . Australian users should try to find what they want at archie.au ( 139.130.4.6 ) which mirrors info-mac and mac.archive . Japanese users will find sumex mirrored at ftp.u-tokyo.ac.jp ( 130.69.254.254 ) . A fourth very important site is ftp.apple.com ( 130.43.2.3 ) . This is Apple 's semi-official repository for system software , developer tools , source code , technical notes , and other things that come more or less straight from Apple 's mouth . Some material at this site may not be distributed outside the U.S. or by other sites that do n't have an official license to distribute Apple system software . Please read the various README documents available at ftp.apple.com for the detailed info if you're connecting from outside the U.S. or if you wish to redistribute material you find here . CAN I GET SHAREWARE BY E-MAIL ? ( 2.2 ) The info-mac archives at sumex-aim are available by E-mail from LISTSERV @ RICEVM1.bitnet ( alternately listserv @ ricevm1.rice.edu ) . The listserver responds to the commands $ MACARCH HELP , $ MACARCH INDEX , and $ MACARCH GET filename . Mac archive files are available from mac @ mac.archive.umich.edu . Send it a message containing the words `` help '' and `` index '' ( no quotes ) on the first two lines of your message for instructions on getting started and a list of the files you may request . You can retrieve files from other sites by using the server at ftpmail @ decwrl.dec.com . For details send it a message with just the text `` help '' ( no quotes ) . WHERE CAN I FIND APPLICATION X ? ( 2.3 ) If you ca n't find what you 're looking for at one of the above sites , try telnetting to your nearest archie server or sending it an E-mail message addressed to archie with the subject `` help . '' Archie servers are located at archie.rutgers.edu ( 128.6.18.15 , America ) , archie.mcgill.ca ( 132.206.2.3 , the original archie server in Canada ) , archie.au ( 139.130.4.6 , Australia ) , archie.funet.fi ( 128.214.6.100 , Scandinavia ) , and archie.doc.ic.ac.uk ( 146.169.3.7 , the U.K. and the continent ) . These sites index the tens of thousands of files available for anonymous ftp . Login as `` archie '' ( no password is needed ) and type `` prog filename '' to find what you 're looking for or type `` help '' for more detailed instructions . For instance you would type `` prog Disinfectant '' to search for a convenient ftp site for Disinfectant . If the initial search fails to turn up the file you want , try variations on and substrings of the name . For instance if you did n't find Disinfectant with `` prog Disinfectant '' , you might try `` prog disi '' instead . Substring searches often hide the gold in a pile of dross . To avoid many erroneous matches add a `` . *\.hqx '' to the end of the substring , e.g . `` prog disi . *\.hqx '' Most Mac software available on the net ends in .hqx but almost no UNIX or PC software does . Please check the above archives and ARCHIE personally BEFORE asking where you can find a particular piece of shareware . If you follow the above advice , you should almost never have to ask the net where to find a particular piece of software . CAN SOMEONE MAIL ME APPLICATION X ? ( 2.4 ) No . Nor will anyone mail you a part of a file from comp.binaries.mac that was corrupt or missed at your site . Please refer to the first questions in this section to find out about anonymous FTP , archie , and automatic E-mail servers . WHAT IS .BIN ? .HQX ? .CPT ? .ETC ? ( 2.5 ) Most files available by FTP are modified twice to allow them to more easily pass through foreign computer systems . First they're compressed to make them faster to download , and then they're translated to either a binhex ( .hqx ) or MacBinary ( .bin ) format that other computers can digest . ( The Macintosh uses a special two-fork filing system that chokes most other computers . ) BinHex files are 7-bit ASCII text files , while MacBinary files are pure 8-bit binary data that must always be transferred using a binary protocol . How a file has been translated and compressed for transmission is indicated by its suffix . Normally a file will have a name something like filename.xxx.yyy . .xxx indicates how it was compressed and .yyy indicates how it was translated . To use a file you 've FTP 'd and downloaded to your Mac you 'll need to reverse the process . Most files you get from the net require a two-step decoding process . First change the binhex ( .hqx ) or MacBinary ( .bin ) file to a double-clickable Macintosh file ; then decompress it . Which programs decode which file types is covered in the table below . Also note that most Macintosh telecommunications programs will automatically convert MacBinary files to regular Macintosh files as they are downloaded . *************************************************************************** Suffix : .sit .cpt .hqx .bin .pit .Z .image .dd .zip .uu .tar Extractors -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- StuffIt 3.0| X X X X X Compact Pro| X X Packit | X UUTool | X MacCompress| X SunTar | X X X X BinHex 5.0 | X BinHex 4.0 | X DiskDoubler| X X UnZip | X DiskCopy | X macutil | X X X X *************************************************************************** A few notes on the decompressors : StuffIt is a family of products that use several different compression schemes . The freeware StuffIt Expander will unstuff all of them . Versions of StuffIt earlier than 3.0 ( StuffIt 1.5.1 , StuffIt Classic , UnStuffIt , and StuffIt Deluxe 2.0 and 1.0 ) will not unstuff the increasing number of files stuffed by StuffIt 3.0 . You need to get a more recent version of StuffIt or StuffIt Expander . StuffIt 3.0.5 ( Lite and Deluxe ) consistently makes smaller archives than any other Macintosh compression utility . To allow maximum space for files on the various ftp sites and to keep net-bandwidth down , please compress all files you send to anonymous ftp sites with StuffIt 3.0.5 . UUTool , MacCompress , and SunTar handle the popular UNIX formats of uuencode ( .uu ) , compress ( .Z ) , and tar ( .tar ) respectively . The UNIX versions are often more robust than the Mac products , so use them instead when that 's an option . Translators that allow StuffIt Lite to expand uuencoded and tar files are also available by anonymous ftp . Macutil is dik winter 's package of UNIX utilities to decompress and debinhex files on a workstation before downloading them to a Mac . Since UNIX stores files differently than does the Mac , macutil creates MacBinary ( .bin ) files which should be automatically converted on download . It ca n't decompress everything . In particular it ca n't decompress the new StuffIt 3.0 archives . : - ( However , if you need only one or two files out of an archive -- for instance if you want to read the README to find out if a program does what you need it to do before you download all of it -- macutil is indispensable . It can be found at sumex-aim in the info-mac/unix directory . A few notes on the compression formats : .bin : These are MacBinary files . Always use a binary file transfer protocol when transferring them , never ASCII or text . Most files on the net are stored as .hqx instead . Only rascal stores most of its files in .bin format . Most communications programs such as ZTerm and MacKermit are capable of translating MacBinary files on the fly as they download if they know in advance they 'll be downloading MacBinary files . .image : This format is normally used only for system software , so that on-line users can download files that can easily be converted into exact copies of the installer floppies . Instead of using DiskCopy to restore the images to floppies , you can use Steve Christensen 's freeware utility MountImage to treat the images on your hard disk as actual floppies inserted in a floppy drive . MountImage has a reputation for being buggy , so you should have some blank floppies and a copy of DiskCopy handy just in case . .sea ( .x , .X ) : .sea files do n't merit a position in the above table because they 're self-extracting . They may have been created with Compact Pro , StuffIt , or even DiskDoubler ; but all should be capable of decompressing themselves when double-clicked . For some unknown reason Alysis has chosen not to use this industry standard designation for self-extracting archives created with their payware products SuperDisk ! and More Disk Space . Instead they append either .x or .X to self-extracting archives . HOW CAN I GET BINHEX ? STUFFIT ? ETC. ? ( 2.6 ) By far the easiest way to get these programs is to ask a human being to copy them onto a floppy for you . If you 're at a university there 's absolutely no excuse for not finding someone to give you a copy ; and if you 're anywhere less remote than McMurdo Sound , chances are very good that someone at a computer center , dealership , or user group can provide you with a copy of StuffIt . Once you have StuffIt ( any version ) you do n't need BinHex . If you 're such a computer geek that the thought of actually asking a living , breathing human being instead of a computer terminal for something turns you into a quivering mass of protoplasmic jelly , you can probably download a working copy of StuffIt from a local bulletin board system . If you have religious objections to software gotten by any means other than anonymous ftp , then I suppose I 'll mention that you can in fact ftp a working copy of StuffIt though this is by far the hardest way to get it . Ftp to wuarchive.wustl.edu and login . Type the word `` binary . '' Hit return . Type `` cd mirrors/rascal.ics.utexas.edu/compression '' and hit return . Then `` get StuffIt_Expander_1.0.1_SEA_bin '' and hit return . Of course it 's always possible that by the time you read this StuffIt Expander will have been updated and the name changed so if this fails look for something similar . If you 've ftp 'd straight onto your Mac you should now have a self-extracting archive which will produce a working copy of StuffIt Expander when double-clicked . If you 've ftp 'd to your mainframe or UNIX account first , you still need to use a modem program to download it to your Mac . Just make sure that the Mac is receiving in MacBinary mode and the mainframe is sending in binary mode . If you need more details on the last step , consult the FAQ list for comp.sys.mac.comm and the manuals for both your mainframe and Macintosh telecommunications software . HOW CAN I GET BINHEX , STUFFIT , ETC . FROM A PC ? ( 2.7 ) You ca n't . There is absolutely NO way to get an executable Macintosh file from an ftp site onto a PC and then onto your Mac without some software obtained by means other than anonymous ftp . You MUST beg , borrow , or steal the necessary software such as Binhex or StuffIt Lite from another person . I realize this may terrify those among you who have n't left your parents ' basement since you got an Apple II+ in 1980 , but eventually you 're going to need to link up with some human being other than your mother . ( though I suppose if you 're this much of a nerd you could send your mother out to get it for you . ) While you 're gathering your nerves for a venture into the strange and terrifying world of daylight , please do n't bother the net by asking this question again . There simply is no way to move executable Macintosh programs from a PC or other non-Macintosh computer onto a Mac without software that is not bundled with most Macs . ================================================================= TROUBLESHOOTING : WHAT TO DO ( BEFORE POSTING ) WHEN THINGS GO WRONG ( 3.0 ) ================================================================= While the various FAQ lists cover a lot of specific problems , there are far more problems that are n't covered here . These are a few basic techniques you should follow before asking for help . You should probably also perform the ten-step preventative maintenance routine described in section four , especially rebuilding the desktop ( 4.3 ) and resizing the system heap ( 4.5 ) . Following these steps may or may not solve your problem , but it will at least make it easier for others to recommend solutions to you . IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM . ( 3.1 ) `` Microsoft Word is crashing '' does n't say much . What were you doing when it crashed ? Can you repeat the actions that lead to the crash ? The more information you provide about the actions preceding the crash the more likely it is someone can help you . The more precisely you 've identified the problem and the actions preceding it ( Step 1 ) the easier it will be to tell if the following steps fix the problem . For example , `` Sometimes QuarkXPress 3.0 crashes with a coprocessor not installed error . '' is not nearly as helpful as `` QuarkXPress 3.0 crashes when I link two text boxes on a master page when copies of those text boxes already contain text . '' The former will leave you wondering whether the bug remains after a given step . The latter lets you go right to the problem and see if it 's still there or not . READ THE READ ME FILE . ( 3.2 ) Many companies include a list of known incompatibilities and bugs in their READ ME files . Often these are n't documented in the manual . Read any READ ME files to see if any of the problems sound familiar . CHECK FOR VIRUSES . ( 3.3 ) Run Disinfectant or another anti-viral across your disk . Virus infections are rarer than most people think , but they do occur and they do cause all sorts of weird problems when they do . REINSTALL THE APPLICATION AND ALL ITS SUPPORT FILES . ( 3.4 ) For half a dozen reasons ( external magnetic fields , improperly written software , the alignment of the planets ) a file on a disk may not contain the data it 's supposed to contain . This can cause all types of unexplained , unusual behavior . Restoring from original masters will normally fix this . REINSTALL THE SYSTEM SOFTWARE . ( 3.5 ) Bits are even more likely to get twiddled in the system file than in the application and the effects can be just as disastrous . See question 4.6 for a detailed procedure for performing a clean reinstall . If the problem continues to occur after you 've taken these steps , chances are you 've found either a conflict between your application and some other software or a genuine bug in the program . So it 's time to ISOLATE THE PROBLEM . ( 3.6 ) You need to find the minimal system on which the problem will assert itself . Here are the basic steps of isolating the cause of a system or application crash : a . Run only one application at a time . Occasionally applications do conflict with each other . If the problem does not manifest itself without other applications running simultaneously , you can begin launching other applications until you find the one that causes the crash . b . If you 're running System 6 , turn off MultiFinder . If you're running System 7 , allot as much memory to the application as you can afford . Sometimes programs just need more memory , especially when performing complicated operations . c. If you 're running System 7 , turn off virtual memory and 32-bit addressing . There 's still an awful lot of System 7 hostile software out there including some from companies that really have no excuse . ( Can you say Microsoft Word 5.1 , boys and girls ? I knew you could . ) Some of this software only expresses its incompatibilities when certain uncommon actions are taken . d. Boot from a virgin system floppy . If the problem disappears you likely have an init conflict . You need to progressively remove extensions until the problem vanishes . Use a little common sense when choosing the first extensions to remove . If the problem occurs when you try to open a file , remove any inits that mess with the Standard File Open procedure such as Super Boomerang first . If the problem remains after the obvious candidates have been eliminated , either remove the remaining extensions one at a time or , if you have a lot of them , perform a binary search by removing half of the extensions at a time . Once the problem disappears add half of the most recently removed set back . Continue until you 've narrowed the conflict down to one extension . When you think you 've found the offending init restart with only that init enabled just to make sure that it and it alone is indeed causing the problem . CONTACT TECHNICAL SUPPORT . ( 3.7 ) By now you should have a very good idea of when , where , and why the conflict occurs . If a tech support number is available for the software , call it . If you 're lucky the company will have a work around or fix available . If not , perhaps they 'll at least add the bug to their database of problems to be fixed in the next release . ====================== PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE ( 4.0 ) ====================== You would n't drive your car 100,000 miles without giving it a tune-up . A computer is no different . Regular tune-ups avoid a lot of problems . Although there are Mac mechanics who 'll be happy to charge you $ 75 or more for the equivalent of an oil change , there's no reason you ca n't change it yourself . The following nine-step program should be performed about every three months . TRASH UNNEEDED FILES ( 4.1 ) Many of the operations that follow will run faster and more smoothly the more free disk space there is to work with so spend a little time cleaning up your hard disk . If you 're at all like me , you 'll find several megabytes worth of preferences files for applications you no longer have , archives of software you've dearchived , shareware you tried out and did n't like , announcements for events that have come and gone and many other files you no longer need . If you 're running System 7 you may also have several more megabytes in your trash can alone . Throw them away and empty the trash . RETHINK YOUR EXTENSIONS ( 4.2 ) Some Macintoshes attract inits like a new suit attracts rain . Seriously consider whether you actually need every extension in your collection . If you do n't use the functionality of an extension at least every fifth time you boot up , you 're probably better off not storing it in your System Folder where it only takes up memory , destabilizes your system , and slows down every startup . For instance if you only read PC disks once a month , there 's no need to keep AccessPC loaded all the time . Cutting back on your extension habit can really help avoid crashes . REBUILD THE DESKTOP ( 4.3 ) The Desktop file/database holds all the information necessary to associate each file with the application that created it . It lets the system know what application should be launched when you open a given file and what icons it should display where . Depending on its size each application has one or more representatives in the desktop file . As applications and files move on and off your hard disk , the Desktop file can be become bloated and corrupt . Think of it as a Congress for your Mac . Every so often it 's necessary to throw the bums out and start with a clean slate . Fortunately it 's easier to rebuild the desktop than to defeat an incumbent . One warning : rebuilding the desktop will erase all comments you 've stored in the Get Info boxes . Under System 7 Maurice Volaski 's freeware init CommentKeeper will retain those comments across a rebuild . CommentKeeper also works with System 6 but only if Apple 's Desktop Manager extension is also installed . To rebuild the desktop restart your Mac and , as your extensions finish loading , depress the Command and Option keys . You 'll be presented with a dialog box asking if you want to rebuild the desktop and warning you that `` This could take a few minutes . '' Click OK . It will take more than a few minutes . The more files you have the longer it will take . If you 're running System 6 you may want to turn off MultiFinder before trying to rebuild the desktop . If you 're experiencing definite problems and not just doing preventive maintenance , you may want to use Fifth Generation's freeware init Desktop Reset . Desktop Reset completely deletes the Desktop file before rebuilding it , thus eliminating possibly corrupt data structures . ZAP THE PRAM AND RESET THE CLOCK ( 4.4 ) All Macs from the original 128K Thin Mac to the Quadra 950 contain a small amount of battery powered RAM to hold certain settings that properly move with the CPU rather than with the disk such as which disk to boot from . Unfortunately this `` parameter RAM '' can become corrupted and cause unexplained crashes . To reset it under System 7 hold down the Command , Option , P , and R keys while restarting your Mac . Under System 6 hold down the Command , Option , and Shift keys while selecting the Control Panel from the Apple menu . Click Yes when asked if you want to zap the parameter RAM . Since you 've erased almost all the settings in the General Control Panel , you should now reset them to whatever you want . The one setting that zapping the PRAM does not erase is the date and time ; but since the internal clock in the Macintosh is notoriously inaccurate you 'll probably want to take this opportunity to reset it anyway . RESIZE THE SYSTEM HEAP ( 4.5 ) Even after rethinking their extensions as per step two most people still have at least half a row of icons march across the bottom of their screen every time they restart . All these extensions ( and most applications too ) need space in a section of memory called the System Heap . If the System Heap is n't big enough to comfortably accommodate all the programs that want a piece of it , they all start playing King of the Mountain on the system heap , knocking each other off to get bigger pieces for themselves and trying to climb back on after they get knocked off . All this fighting amongst the programs severely degrades system performance and almost inevitably crashes the Mac . If you 're using System 7 , your Macintosh will automatically resize the system heap as necessary ; but if you 're running System 6 it 's important to set your system heap size large enough to manage all your extensions and applications . By default this size is set to 128K , way too small for most Macs with any extensions at all . The system heap size is stored in the normally non-editable boot blocks of every system disk . Bill Steinberg 's freeware utility BootMan not only lets you resize your system heap but even checks how much memory your heap is already using so it can tell how much needs to be allocated . If you 're running System 6 , get BootMan , use it , and be amazed at how infrequently your Macintosh crashes . REINSTALL THE SYSTEM SOFTWARE ( 4.6 ) System files can become corrupt and fragmented , especially if you 've stored lots of fonts and desk accessories inside them . Merely updating the System software will often not fix system file corruption . I recommend doing a clean reinstall . Here 's how : 1 . Boot from the installer floppy of your System disks . 2 . Copy any non-standard fonts and desk accessories out of your System file into a temporary suitcase . 3 . Trash the System file on your hard disk . Also trash the Finder , MultiFinder , DA Handler , and all other standard Apple extensions like Control Panel and Chooser . These will all be replaced in the new installation . If you 're running or installing System 7 , move everything in the Extensions , Control Panels , and Preferences folders into the top level of the System Folder . 4 . Rename the System Folder . Any name other than System Folder is fine . 5 . Double-click the installer script on your System disk . Then choose Customize ... Select the appropriate software for your model Mac and printer . You could do an Easy Install instead , but that will only add a lot of extensions and code you do n't need that waste your memory and disk space . 6 . Once installation is finished , move everything from the temporary folder you created in step 4 into the new System folder . If you 're asked if you want to replace anything , you forgot to take something out in step 3 . You 'll need to replace things individually until you find the duplicate piece . 7 . Reinstall any fonts or DA 's you removed in step 2 . 8 . Reboot . You should now have a clean , defragmented System file that takes up less memory and disk space and a much more stable system overall . DISK UTILITIES ( 4.7 ) Much like system files hard disks have data structures that occasionally become corrupted affecting performance and even causing data loss . Apple includes Disk First Aid , a simple utility for detecting and repairing hard disk problems , with its System disks . It 's also available for anonymous ftp from ftp.apple.com in the directory dts/mac/sys.soft/hdsc . Even if you have an earlier version , you should get the latest version ( 7.1 ) from ftp.apple.com and run it on all your hard disks . Several companies have released payware disk utilities that detect and repair considerably more problems than Disk First Aid though , interestingly , none of them detect and repair everything that Disk First Aid does . The three most effective for general work are Central Point 's MacTools Deluxe 2.0 , Fifth Generation's Public Utilites , and Symantec 's Norton Utilities for the Macintosh 2.0 . A department or work group should have all of these as well as Disk First Aid since none of them fix everything the others do . For individuals MacTools ( $ 48 street ) is about half the price of Norton ( $ 94 street ) or Public Utilities ( $ 98 street ) so , features and ease of use being roughly equal , I recommend MacTools . All of these products occasionally encounter problems they ca n't fix . When that happens it 's time to backup ( 4.7 ) and reformat ( 4.9 ) . BACKING UP ( 4.8 ) This is one part of preventative maintenance that should be done a LOT more often than every three months . The simplest back up is to merely copy all the files on your hard disk onto floppies or other removable media . If you keep your data files separate from your application and support files then it 's easy to only back up those folders which change frequently . Nonetheless every three months you should do a complete backup of your hard disk . A number of programs are available to make backing up easier . Apple included a very basic full backup application with System 6 . With the Performas Apple ships a new Apple Backup utility that can backup the entire disk or just the System folder onto floppies . The previously mentioned Norton Utilities for the Mac and MacTools Deluxe 2.0 include more powerful floppy backup utilities that incorporate compression and incremental backups . Finally if you 're lucky enough to have a Tape Drive , network server , or removable media device to use for backups , you should check out the more powerful payware utilities Redux ( $ 49 street , does n't support tape drives ) and Diskfit Pro ( $ 74 street ) . There are NO freely available backup utilities other than the old HD Backup from System 6 . DISK DEFRAGMENTATION ( 4.9 ) As disks fill up it gets harder and harder to find enough free space in the same place to write large files . Therefore the operating system will often split larger files into pieces to be stored in different places on your hard disk . As files become more and more fragmented performance can degrade . There are several ways to defragment a hard disk . The most tedious but cheapest method is to backup all your files , erase the hard disk ( and you might as well reformat while you 're at it . See question 4.10 . ) , and restore all the files . A number of payware utilities including Norton Utilities for the Mac and Mac Tools Deluxe can defragment a disk in place , i.e . without erasing it . Although the ads for all these products brag about their safety , once you 've bought the software and opened the shrink-wrap they all warn you to back up your disk before defragmenting it in case something does go wrong . There are NO freeware or shareware disk defragmenters so please do n't annoy the net by asking for one . REFORMAT YOUR HARD DISK ( 4.10 ) Just as a floppy disk needs to be initialized before use , so a hard disk must be formatted before it can hold data . You don't need to reformat every three months ; but when your system is crashing no matter what you try , reformatting is the ultimate means of wiping the slate clean . Reformatting your hard disk may even gain you a few extra megabytes of space . Not all hard disks are created equal . Some can hold more data than others . To facilitate mass production and advertising without a lot of asterisks ( * 81.3 megabytes is the average formatted capacity . Your mileage may vary . ) Apple often formats drives to the lowest common denominator of drive capacity . When you reformat there 's no reason at all not to reclaim whatever unused space Apple 's left on your disk . Unlike floppies hard disks need a special program to initialize them . Most hard disks come with formatting software . Apple 's disks and System software ship with HD SC setup , a minimal disk formatter which will format Apple brand hard drives ONLY . Most other manufacturers ship appropriate formatting software with their hard drives . Normally this will be all you need to reformat your hard disk . A number of general-purpose formatters are also available which go beyond the bundled software to include features like encryption , password protection , multiple partitioning , faster disk access , System 7 compatibility , and even compression . Two of the best are the payware Drive7 and Hard Disk Toolkit Personal Edition ( $ 49 street for either ) . While there are one or two freeware formatters available , none are likely to be superior to the ones bundled with your hard disk . PowerBook users should be sure to turn off Sleep and processor cycling before reformatting their hard drives no matter what software they use . Otherwise disk corruption , crashes , and data losses are a very good possibility .

From : ldo @ waikato.ac.nz ( Lawrence D'Oliveiro , Waikato University ) Subject : QuickTime performance ( was Re : Rumours about 3DO ? ? ? ) Organization : University of Waikato , Hamilton , New Zealand Lines : 67 OK , with all the discussion about observed playback speeds with QuickTime , the effects of scaling and so on , I thought I 'd do some more tests . First of all , I felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than realistic . The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it ( it was a version of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor ) . I decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results ( for better or for worse ) . I pulled out a copy of `` 2001 : A Space Odyssey '' that I had recorded off TV a while back . About fifteen minutes into the movie , there 's a sequence where the Earth shuttle is approaching the space station . Specifically , I digitized a portion of about 30 seconds ' duration , zooming in on the rotating space station . I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between frames . To increase the differences between frames , I digitized it at only 5 frames per second , to give a total of 171 frames . I captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot card in my Centris 650 ( quarter-size resolution from a PAL source ) . I then imported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor , keeping the 5 fps frame rate . I created two versions of the movie : one scaled to 320*240 resolution , the other at 160*120 resolution . I used the default '' 2.00 '' quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1 , and specified a key frame every ten frames . I then ran the 320*240 movie through the same `` Raw Speed Test '' program I used for the results I 'd been reporting earlier . Result : a playback rate of over 45 frames per second . That 's right , I was getting a much higher result than with that first short test movie . Just for fun , I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard disk ( a Quantum LP105S ) , and ran it from there . This time the playback rate was only about 35 frames per second . Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk ( also a Quantum ) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback . I modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional scaling factors , and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240 size . This time the playback speed was over 60 fps . Clearly , the poster who observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in action , not 1.5 . I 'd try my tests with QuickTime 1.0 , but I do n't think it's entirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1 ... Unscaled , the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps . The other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with '' preferred '' playback rates greater than 1.0 , and seeing how well they played from within MoviePlayer ( ie with QuickTime 's normal synchronized playback ) . A preferred rate of 9.0 ( = > 45 fps ) did n't work too well : the playback was very jerky . Compare this with the raw speed test , which achieved 45 fps with ease . I ca n't believe that QuickTime 's synchronization code would add this much overhead : I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system 's task switching . A preferred rate of 7.0 ( = > 35 fps ) seemed to work fine : I could n't see any evidence of stutter . At 8.0 ( = > 40 fps ) I *think* I could see slight stutter , but with four key frames every second , it was hard to tell . I guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the key frames , to make the stutter more noticeable . Of course , this will also improve the compression slightly , which should speed up the playback performance even more ...

Your hypothesis assumes that the Lotto players have no impact on the selection of the numbers , and hence their ability to win . Well , that 's certainly true in Lotto . But it has absolutely NOTHING to do with the sport of baseball . When you start down the wrong path , you finish down the wrong path . I repeat . I do not think that statistical analysis of prior clutch hitting performance is an accurate predictor of future clutch hitting performance .

The motherboard manufacturer where I usually buy boards says > that they will have this problem fixed in about two weeks ... > | Brian J Schaufenbuel I do n't see this as a problem with the chip-set ( a mistake ) , I see this as something that was designed-in intentionally . So it would seem that to enhance the design ( from 24 to 32-bit EISA DMA ) would require an update to the chipset . An update to the chipset may begat an update to the motherboard board design . What I 'm saing is : The motherboard manufacturer seems to be passing this off as a simple fix . In my mind the fix is a updated chipset from HINT along with a possible motherboard layout update . This is not simple . If I were you I would be cautious about this . You might look into the Advanced Integration Research ( AIR ) VL/EISA motherboard . All slots are EISA/ISA capable . 2 ( or 3 ) of the slots are VL-bus capable . The AIR people confirmed this board supports 'real' 32-bit EISA DMA ( I called them ) . Pentium/P5 ( ? ) capable .

If it is n't at one of the receiptants location , forget encryption at all . You have blown any security you thought you might have had . Most of the people using encrypted conference bridges these days are military ( or equivalent , like CIA and other embassy personnel ) , so putting bridges on the recipient 's location is normal - it 's in a vault on a military base or Ft. Meade , and the secure phones are in sound-proof rooms with big locks on the doors because they 're talking about Classified Stuff ( or Golf with Other Generals . ) That paradigm will change as we start using encrypted phones in our offices or homes to carry on normal conversations about dinner plans and stock purchases and meeting schedules and technical info and the good batch of illegal frop that we got last weekend from Bob ; most people do n't use sound-proof vaults , and may use bridges in their PBX or from the local phone company ( 3-way calls ) or Long Distance or value-added phone company ( e.g . Alliance conference bridges ) . If Clipjack is mainly used for the radio portion of cellular phones , the conferencing aspects do n't change .

From : rw @ astro.Princeton.EDU ( Ralph A.M.J . Wijers ) Subject : Re : Gamma Ray Bursters . WHere are they . Originator : news @ nimaster Nntp-Posting-Host : astro.princeton.edu Organization : Princeton University Lines : 51 I feel compelled to complain : the statement that recent observations rule out merging neutron stars as sources of gamma-ray bursts is utterly false , even though it is popular enough to make it to BATSE press releases . The idea behind the statement is as follows : `` if you smack two neutron stars together , or have a neutron star be gobbled up by a black hole , a lot of energy is released , enough for a gamma-ray burst at a cosmological distance . But , so the reasoning continues , this energy is released below a lot of matter , so the radiation becomes thermalized and you expect to see roughly a blackbody spectrum . The observed spectra are strongly non-thermal , so this model must be wrong . '' As so often , the fault lies with the imagination of the person who was trying to prove the model wrong rather than with the model . It may be that the initial energy release is not seen as a gamma-ray burst , but the 'fireball ' of energy and matter that is created may spew out a relativistic flow . When this slams into the surrounding medium , a strong flux of non-thermal gamma rays results , which may carry off a substantial fraction of the initial total energy . All this is not my idea : it is in a series of papers by Martin Rees , Peter Meszaros ( sorry for the missing accents : - ) and co-workers . It is certainly not a complete model , but it may well be the best one around ( summing over all proposed distance scales ) . An alternative proposal for what creates the initial fireball , by the way , is the so-called 'failed supernovae ' scenario by Stan Woosley , in which a very massive star at the end of its life collapses to a black hole . If the stellar core was rotating , part of the infalling matter will be temporarily halted because it is supported by centrifugal force , and form a very dense neutron torus that accretes onto the black hole . This beast may spew out a jet along the rotation axis , which again constitutes relativistic flow . The rate of such events may be much higher than that of neutron star mergers , but the flux may be more strongly beamed , so that the net rate of bursts observed on Earth stays the same between the two scenarios , but the energy released per event can be a lot less in the failed supernova scenario . On another note : I do believe that the distance scale must ultimately be resolved via some classical astronomical method such as finding counterparts to the bursts at other wavelengths , or finding a definitive signature of some known class of objects in the distribution of positions and fluxes . Theorists have historically not been too successfull in finding the distance of any object by proving that there is only one possible way in which the object can work , and therefore it *must* be so-and-so .

From : `` nigel allen '' < nigel.allen @ canrem.com > Subject : Occupational Injuries and Disease : Workers Memorial Day Reply-To : `` nigel allen '' < nigel.allen @ canrem.com > Organization : Canada Remote Systems Distribution : sci Lines : 97 Here is a press release from the American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees . Unions Point To Deadly Workplaces ; AFSCME , Other Unions Commemorate Workers Memorial Day To : National Desk , Labor Writer Contact : Janet Rivera of the American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees , AFL-CIO , 202-429-1130 WASHINGTON , April 23 -- The American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees ( AFSCME ) and other unions of the AFL-CIO on Wednesday , April 28 , will commemorate the fifth annual Workers Memorial Day -- a day to pay homage to the 6 million workers who are killed , injured , or diseased on the job . This year , AFSCME will focus its Workers Memorial Day efforts an the dangerous environment in which corrections officers must work . Earlier this month , an AFSCME corrections officer , Robert Vallandingham , was killed by inmates who overtook the corrections facility in Lucasville , Ohio . The law and order agenda of the 1980s has resulted in a steady increase in the prison population for the past five years . On Jn . 1 , 1992 , the prison population was 709,587 . Projections show a continued increase in the number of inmates , with an expected prison population of 811,253 in 1994 . The conditions which this burgeoning prison population has created for corrections officers is partially reflected in the number of assaults by inmates against staff . Assaults against staff increased dramatically between 1987 and 1989 , and remain high . In 1987 , there were 808 assaults by inmates against staff , compared to 9,961 such assaults in 1991 . The increased number of inmates has brought on the dangerous combination of overcrowding and understaffing . For example in Ohio officer-to-inmate ratio is 1 to 8.4 -- the second worst ratio in the nation . The national average is 1 to 5.3 . Other health and safety issues facing corrections officers include AIDS , Hepatitis B , tuberculosis , stress , and chemical hazards . AFSCME has more than 50,000 members who work in the nation's federal , state and local correctional facilities . Correction officers are not alone in performing their jobs under life-threatening conditions . Every year , 10,000 American workers die from job-related injuries , and tens of thousands more die from occupational disease . Public employees do some of the nation's most dangerous jobs . Perilous occupations include : -- Highway Workers - Highway workers are often injured and frequently killed by moving traffic because work zones are not barricaded or do n't have proper lighting . -- Health Care Workers - Hospitals have the highest number of job-related injuries and illnesses of any private sector employer and nursing homes ranked fifth . There were more than 325,000 job-related illnesses and injuries in private sector hospitals in 1991 , up almost 10 percent over the previous year . It is generally believed that health care workers employed at public sector hospitals and nursing homes have a significantly higher rate of injuries and illnesses than do their private sector counterparts . Health and safety issues facing health care workers include exposure to tuberculosis and the HIV virus , back injuries , and high levels of stress . -- Social Workers - Social workers who work in mental health institutions are often the victims of assaults and , sometimes , fatal attacks . For instance , last October , a man carrying a semiautomatic handgun walked into the Schuyler County Social Services Building in Watkins Glenn , N.Y. and fatally shot social services workers , before turning the gun on himself . There are two basic problems . First is a growing lack of support services for people who do n't have the help they need . Because workers are overworked , some clients are not given the adequate amount of counselling . Such conditions may cause clients to become more frustrated . The `` quality '' of the clients is also becoming more violent , as more are moved out of the institutions . Nearly 2 million workers have been killed by workplace hazards since OSHA was passed . Moreover , as AFSCME President Gerald W. McEntee explains , OSHA does not provide workplace safety protections for public employees . `` More than 1,600 public employees are killed each year on the job , yet 27 states still provide no federally-approved OSHA coverage for public employees , '' said McEntee . `` This , despite the fact that public employees -- highway workers , health care workers , corrections officers , to name but a few -- do some of the most dangerous work in our society . This year we are fighting for passage of OSHA reform legislation to give all workers greater rights and protections , and finally guarantee all public employees safe workplaces . We need the public support to be successful . '' Government workers suffer 25 percent more injuries than private sector workers , and these injuries are almost 75 percent more severe . Public employees were exempted from OSHA when the law was passed in 1970 and today , public employees in more than half the states have no OSHA coverage . -30- -- Canada Remote Systems - Toronto , Ontario 416-629-7000/629-7044

This seems to me to clearly imply reincarnation . This was a popular belief in the Judaism of Jesus ` time , that Elijah would return again ( as he had been taken in to heaven in a chariot and did not actually die ) . However Jesus was referring to John the Baptist not in the sense that Elijah was reincarnated as John ( remember Elijah didn ` t die ) but that John was a similar prophet to Elijah . John was a fiery preacher , he wore sackcloth and wandered rough through Israel preaching the coming kingdom . The verses that describe him ( in Mark ` s gospel ) can be linked to OT references about Elijah . Hence John was similar to Elijah and Jesus was drawing the parallels between the two just as he drew parallels with the Suffering Servant in Isaiah ( and other messianic figures ) and himself . A brief reply but I don ` t have time to look up all the relevant stuff . Suffice to say there is a very strong explanation .

From : rhaller @ ns.uoregon.edu ( Rich Haller ) Subject : ReSound hearing aid theory as I understand it Organization : University of Oregon Lines : 41 Distribution : world NNTP-Posting-Host : rhaller.cc.uoregon.edu The following is based on copies I was given of some articles published in Hearing Instruments . I would appreciate any comments about this and other 'new ' technology for hearing aids . The ReSound system was developed on the basis of some research at AT & T and appears to take a different approach from other aids . It appears to me that a new 'programmable ' aid like the Widex just uses a more flexible ( and programmable ) version of the classical approach of amplifying some parts of the spectrum more than others and adding some compression to try and help out in 'noisy ' situations . The major difference in the ReSound approach is that it divides the spectrum into low and high frequencies ( splitting point is programmable ) , apparently based on the fact that lots of vowel information can be found in the low frequencies , while the important consonant information ( unfortunately for me ) is in the high frequencies . The two bands then are treated with different compression schemes which are programable . They have also developed a new fitting algorythm that builds on what they call 'abnormal growth of loudness ' . This latter is interesting and fits my own personal experience , though I think the phrase is missleading . What appears to be the case is that as you exceed the minimum threshold for a person with hearing loss , the deficit becomes progresslively less compared to normals and by the time you reach the 'too loud ' point the sensitivity curves appear to converge . This means that if you just boost all sound levels , you are overloading at the high end for people with hearing losses . Hence what you want is progressively less amplification as the signal get closer to the maximum tolerable point . You want to boost low volume sounds more than high and do so potentially differently for the low and high frequency parts of the spectrum ( specially for someone like me who is relatively normal up to 1000 cps and then falls off a cliff ) . Aids with simple compressors do n't descriminate between energy in the low and high frequencies and can therefor 'compress ' useful high frequency information because of high volume of low frequency components . Particularly impressive was the ReSound performance with whispered speech and in simulated restaurant noise situations . -Rich Haller < rhaller @ ns.uoregon.edu > University of Oregon , Eugene , OR , USA

Perhaps one other thing I should have added is that Jeremiah 's prophesies about the coming destruction of Jerusalem would have been understood by the people of that time to be a full frontal assault on their understanding of their relationship with the Lord . Today the if the general populace hears `` prophesies '' like the Portland earthquake or New York will burn ones , they are unlikely to see it in the context of their relationship ( or lack of it ) with the Lord . They are far more likely to think that they are just the result of the fevered imaginations of a religious nutter . That is one reason why I am always deep ; y suspicious of bald judgement prophesies without any explanation of the reasons for the judgement . This does n't have to be long winded . To see a relatively modern example look at Abraham Lincoln 's second inaugural speech . The relevant section is below . It is this type of spiritual insight which was missing in both prophesies posted here . -- - Excerpt from Abraham Lincoln 's 2nd Inaugural speech -- -- Both read the same Bible , and pray to the same God ; and each invokes His aid against the other . It may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just God 's assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other men 's faces ; but let us judge not that we be not judged . The prayers of both could not he answered that of neither has been answered fully . The Almighty has His own purposes . ''Woe unto the world because of offences ! for it must needs be that offences come ; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh '' If we shall suppose that American Slavery is one of those offences which , in the provdence of God , must needs come but which , having continued through His appointed time , He now wills to remove and that He gives to both North and South , this terrible war , as the woe due to those by whom the offence came , shall we discern therein an departure from those divine attribute which the believers in a Living God always ascribe to Him ? Fondly do we hope - fervently do we pray - that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away . Yet , if God wills that it continue , until all the wealth piled by the bond-man 's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk , and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword , as was said three thousand years ago , so still it must be said `` the judgments of the Lord , are true and righteous altogether '' With malice toward none ; with charity for all ; with firmness in the right , as God gives us to see the right , let us strive on to finish the work we are in ; to bind up the nation 's wounds ; to care for him who shall have borne the battle , and for his widow , and his orphan - to do all which may achieve and cherish a just , and a lasting peace , among ourselves , and with all nations . -- ___ Bill Rea ( o o ) -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -w -- U -- w -- - | Bill Rea , Computer Services Centre , | E-Mail b.rea @ csc.canterbury.ac.nz | | University of Canterbury , | or cctr114 @ csc.canterbury.ac.nz | | Christchurch , New Zealand | Phone ( 03 ) -642-331 Fax ( 03 ) -642-999 | -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -

Well for starters , why use rle files ? You might have a specific program that needs them , OK , but I tend to convert straight to jpeg format , thus a 2.4meg 24bit targa file becomes a ~80k or less 24bit jpeg . The latest versions of XV ( 2.2.1 ? ) and xloadimage ( 3.03 ) both handle jpeg files . And the best way to convert to jpeg is with the c/djpeg suit . Even at 90 % quality ( you ca n't see the difference ) the jpeg is way smaller than anything else even an 8bit gif !

Perhaps the listlessness caused by thyroid deficiency could mimic depression , or feeling unable to do anything could cause one to get depressed , but I know of no specific effect on the brain caused by the thyroid that would cause depression . Note that weight gain is usually a symptom of both . Simple blood tests would indicate if a thyroid condition is present . I do n't know if depression would cause a reduction in thyroid output , but I would tend to doubt it . As far as I know clinical depression is caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain , and that chemical imbalance has no direct effect on any other part of the body . A regular everyday depression IMHO should not cause a chemical imbalance in the body at all . The pituitary bases its secretions of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone ( TSH ) on the level of circulating Thyroxin ( there are two types T3 and T4 - one is used as a reserve and is changed into the other -active- form in the liver ) . The ratio of T3 & T4 can be affected by a number of other hormones ( estrogen , for example ) . Naturally , changing activity of the body 's cells would cause changes in availabilty of free thyroxin , but the liver and a healthy thyroid should be able to balance things out in short order . Good sources for info on the thyroid are the Merk Manual ( a physician's reference book ) although reading it is enough to get one depressed : - ) and the Encyclopedia Brittanica ( should be available in your local library ) . I hope this has been of some help . -Eileen Bauer

Well , it looks like , just as Doug trumped Tim , beating him to the net with his defensive analyses , so Tim has gotten in ahead of me . The way I was doing it was a little different . Being me , of course , I used equivalent averages to work out how many runs a player was worth , and I calculated both rate of performance ( fielding equivalent average ) and total performance ( fielding equivalent runs ) . But I compared , not to the average player , but the replacement player , and here 's why : because the positional adjustment comes built in to the system . In the AL of 1992 , the average SS is 32.9 runs above replacement ( RAR ) ; cf , 31.6 ; 2B , 28.8 ; 3B , 26.3 ; LF , 26.0 ; RF , 24.6 ; 1B , 16.9 . We may quibble with the exact numbers , but the order looks substantially right . In the equivalent average , I have always set league average to .235 . I had decided in hitting that the replacement level batter has an eqa of .180 ; the name of that replacement level hitter , often as not , is '' Billy Ripken '' . I decided to let the replacement level fielder be the same distance from .235 as .180 , but in the opposite direction as I have set it up ; that makes for an eqa of .280 . ( Yes , I can add . Runs are proportional to eqa squared ; the difference between 180 squared and 235 squared equals the difference to 279 squared , and I rounded off for simplicity ) . An all-replacement fielding team would have : Randy Milligan at first ( .282 ) , Willie Randolph ( .269 ) at second , Leo Gomez ( .279 ) at third , Walt Weiss ( .269 ) at short , Kevin Bass ( .271 ) in left , HoJo ( .257 ) in center , and Eric Anthony ( .277 ) in right . Ugh . So , the total number of RAR for a player is the sum of his batting and fielding RAR . I can rate them by total RAR , or RAR per some number of batting outs , like 400 . An average player has a total RAR of about 55 , 30 batting , 25 fielding . Total RAR ( bat/field ) 1 . Bonds 152 ( 124/28 ) Ventura 124 ( 66/58 ) 2 . Sandberg 143 ( 88/55 ) Thomas 122 ( 110/12 ) 3 .

The drug , which contains a synthetic hormone similar to the natural hormone progesterone , protects women from pregnancy for three months per injection . The hormone is injected into the muscle of the arm or buttock where it is released into the bloodstream to prevent pregnancy . It is more than 99 percent effective . `` This drug presents another long-term , effective option for women to prevent pregnancy , '' said FDA Commissioner David A. Kessler , M.D . `` As an injectable , given once every three months , Depo Provera eliminates problems related to missing a daily dose . '' Depo Provera is available in 150 mg. single dose vials from doctors and clinics and must be given on a regular basis to maintain contraceptive protection . If a patient decides to become pregnant , she discontinues the injections . As with any such products , FDA advises patients to discuss the benefits and risks of Depo Provera with their doctor or other health care professional before making a decision to use it . Depo Provera 's effectiveness as a contraceptive was established in extensive studies by the manufacturer , the World Health Organization and health agencies in other countries . U.S. clinical trials , begun in 1963 , also found Depo Provera effective as an injectable contraceptive . The most common side effects are menstrual irregularities and weight gain . In addition , some patients may experience headache , nervousness , abdominal pain , dizziness , weakness or fatigue . The drug should not be used in women who have acute liver disease , unexplained vaginal bleeding , breast cancer or blood clots in the legs , lungs or eyes . The labeling advises doctors to rule out pregnancy before prescribing the drug , due to concerns about low birth weight in babies exposed to the drug . HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 14 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 Recent data have also demonstrated that long-term use may contribute to osteoporosis . The manufacturer will conduct additional research to study this potential effect . Depo Provera was Developed in the 1960s and has been approved for contraception in many other countries . The UpJohn Company of Kalamazoo , Mich. , which will market the drug under the name , Depo Provera Contraceptive Injection , first submitted it for approval in the United States in the 1970s . At that time , animal studies raised questions about its potential to cause breast cancer . Worldwide studies have since found the overall risk of cancer , including breast cancer in humans , to be minimal if any . HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 15 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 New Rules Speed Approval of Drugs for Life-Threatening Illnesses P92-37 Food and Drug Administration Monica Revelle - ( 301 ) 443-4177 The Food and Drug Administration today announced that it will soon publish new rules to shed the approval of drugs for patients with serious or life- threatening illnesses , such as AIDS , cancer and Alzheimer 's disease . `` These final rules will help patients who are suffering the most serious illnesses to get access to new drugs months or even years earlier than would otherwise be possible , '' said HHS Secretary Louis W. Sullivan , M.D . `` The effort to accelerate FDA review for these drugs has been a long-term commitment and indeed a hallmark of this administration . '' These rules establish procedures for the Food and Drug Administration to approve a drug based on `` surrogate endpoints '' or markers . They apply when the drug provides a meaningful benefit over currently available therapies . Such endpoints would include laboratory tests or physical signs that do not in themselves constitute a clinical effect but that are judged by qualified scientists to be likely to correspond to real benefits to the patient . Use of surrogate endpoints for measurement of drug efficacy permits approval earlier than if traditional endpoints -- such as relief of disease symptoms or prevention of disability and death from the disease -- are used . The new rules provide for therapies to be approved as soon as safety and effectiveness , based on surrogate endpoints , can be reasonably established . The drug 's sponsor will be required to agree to continue or conduct postmarketing human studies to confirm that the drug 's effect on the surrogate endpoint is an indicator of its clinical effectiveness . One new drug -- zalcitabine ( also called ddC ) -- was approved June 19 , using a model of this process , for treating the human immunodeficiency virus , HIV , the cause of AIDS . Accelerated approval can also be used , if necessary , when FDA determines that a drug , judged to be effective for the treatment of a disease , can be used safely only under a restricted distribution plan . `` The new rules will help streamline the drug development and review process without sacrificing goad science and rigorous FDA oversight , '' said FDA commissioner David A. Kessler , M.D . `` While drug approval will be accomplished faster , these drugs and biological products must still meet safety and effectiveness standards required by law . '' HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 16 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 The new procedures also allow for a streamlined withdrawal process if the postmarketing studies do not verify the drug 's clinical benefit , if there is new evidence that the drug product is not shown to be safe and effective , or if other specified circumstances arise that necessitate expeditious withdrawal of the drug or biologic .

[ NASDAQ : REGN ] have discovered that certain naturally occurring substances known as neurotrophic factors can prevent the degeneration of light-sensing cells in the retina of the eye . The degeneration of these cells , known as photoreceptors , is a major cause of visual impairment This research , published to in the December issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science ( PNAS ) , holds promise for people who may lose their sight due to progressive retinal degeneration -- currently , no drug treatment for retinal degeneration exists . It is estimated that 2.5 million Americans have severe vision loss due to age-related macular degeneration and 100,000 Americans are affected by retinitis pigmentosus , a hereditary disease that causes blindness . In addition , each year more than 15,000 people undergo surgical procedures to repair retinal detachments and other retinal traumas . The research was funded in part by the RP ( Retinitis Pigmentosa ) Foundation Fighting Blindness , Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and the National Eye Institute . It was conducted by Drs . Matthew M. LaVail , Kazuhiko Unoki , Douglas Yasurnura , Michael T. Matthes and Roy H. Steinberg at UCSF , arld Dr. C ; eorge Yancoooulos , Regeneron 's Vice President for Discovery . Regeneron holds an exclusive license for this research from UCSF . In the research described in the PNAS , a light-damage model was used to assess the survival-promoting activity of a number of naturally occurring substances . Experimental rats were exposed to constant light for one week . Eyes that had not been treated with an effective factor lost most of their photoreceptor cells -- the rods and cones of the retina -- after light exposure . Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor ( BDNF ) and Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor ( CNTF ) were particularly effective in this model without causing unwanted side effects ; other factors such as Nerve Growth Factor ( NGF ) and Insulin-like Growth Factor ( IGF-1 ) were not effective in these experiments . Discussing the research , Dr. Jesse M. Cedarbaum , Regeneron 's Director of Clinical Research , said , `` BDNF 's ability to rescue neurons in the retina that have been damaged by light exposure may hold promise for the treatment of age- related macular degeneration , one of the leading causes of vision impairment , and for retinal detachment . Following detachment , permanent vision loss may HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 18 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 result frorn the death of detached retinal cells . It is possible that BDNF could play a role in rescuing those cells once the retina has been reattached surgically . '' `` Retinitis pigmentosa is a slowly progressing disease that causes the retina to degenerate over a period of years or even decades . Vision decreases to a small tunnel of sight and can result in total blindness . It is our hope that research on growth factors will provide a means to slow the progression and preserve useful vision throughout life , '' stated Jeanette S. Felix , Ph.D. , Director of Science for the RP Foundation Fighting Blindness . In addition to the work described , Regeneron is developing BDNF in conjunction with Aingen Inc. [ NASDAQ : AMGN ] as a possible treatment for peripheral neuropathies associated with diabetes and cancer chemotherapy , motor neuron diseases , Parkinson 's disease , and Alzheimer 's disease . By itself , Regeneron is testing CNTF in patients with arnyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( commonly known as Lou Gehrig 's disease ) . Regeneron Pharlnaceuticals , Inc. , based in Tarrytown , New York , is a leader in the discovery and development of biotechnology-based compounds for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases , peripheral neuropathies and nerve injuries , which affect more than seven million Americans . Drs . LaVail and Steinberg of UCSF are consultants to Regeneron . HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 19 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 Affluent Diet Increases Risk Of Heart Disease Research Resources Reporter written by Mary Weideman Nov/Dec 1992 National Institutes of Health High-fat , high-calorie diets rapidly increase risk factors for coronary heart disease in native populations of developing countries that have traditionally consumed diets low in fat . These findings , according to investigators at the Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland , have serious implications for public health in both industrialized and developing countries . `` This study demonstrates why we can develop coronary heart disease and have higher blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels . It shows also the importance of diet and particularly the potential of the diet to increase body weight , thereby leading to a whole host of other health problems in developing countries and affluent nations as well , '' explains principal investigator Dr. William E. Connor , head of the section of clinical nutrition and lipid metabolism at Oregon Health Sciences University . Over the past 25 years Dr. Connor and his team have characterized the food and nutrient intakes of the Tara humara Indians in Mexico , while simultaneously documenting various aspects of Tarahumara lipid metabolism . These native Mexicans number approximately 50,000 and reside in the Sierra Madre Occidental Mountains in the state of Chihuahua . The Tarahumaras have coupled an agrarian diet to endurance racing . Probably as a result , coronary heart disease , which is so prevalent in Western industrialized nations , is virtually non existent in their culture . Loosely translated , the name Tarahumara means `` fleet of foot , '' reflecting a tribal passion for betting on '' kickball '' races , in which participants run distances of 100 miles or more while kicking a machete-carved wooden ball . The typical Tarahumara diet consists primarily of pinto beans , tortillas , and pinole , a drink made of ground roasted corn mixed with cold water , together with squash and gath ered fruits and vegetables . The Tara humaras also eat small amounts of game , fish , and eggs . Their food contains approximately 12 percent of total calories as fat of which the majority ( 69 percent ) is of vegetable origin . Dietician Martha McMurry , a coinvestigator in the study , describes their diet as simple and very rich in nutrients while low in cholesterol and fat . The Tarahumaras have average plasma cholesterol levels of 121 mg/ dL , low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) -cholesterol levels of 72 mg/dl , and high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) -cholesterol levels of 32 to 42 mg/dl . All of those values are in the good , low-risk range , according to the researchers . Elevated cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels are considered risk factors for heart HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 20 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 disease . HDL-cholesterol is considered beneficial . In previous studies the Tarahumaras had been found to be at low risk for cardiac disease , although able to respond to high-cholesterol diets with elevations in total and LDL- cholesterol . Clinical Research Center dietitian McMurry and coinvestigator Maria Teresa Cerqueira established a metabolic unit in a Jesuit mission school building near a community hospital in the small village of Sisoguichi . Food was weighed , cooked , and fed to the study participants under the investigators ' direct supervision , ensuring that subjects ate only food stipulated by the research protocol . Fasting blood was drawn twice weekly , and plasma samples were frozen and shipped to Dr. Connors laboratory for cholesterol , triglyceride , and lipoprotein analyses . Regular measurements included participant body weight , height , and triceps skin fold thickness . Thirteen Tarahumaras , five women and eight men , including one adolescent , were fed their native diet for 1 week , followed by 5 weeks of an `` affluent '' diet . `` In this study we went up to a concentration of dietary fat that was 40 percent of total calories . This is the prototype of the holiday diet that many Americans consume a diet high in fat , sugar , and cholesterol , low in fiber , '' elaborates Dr. Conners . Such dietary characteristics are reflected in the cholesterol-saturation index , or CSI , recently devised research dietitian Sonja Conner working with Dr. Connor . `` The CSI is a single number that incorporates both the amount of cholesterol and the amount of saturated fat in the diet . CSI indicates the diet 's potential to elevate the cholesterol level , particularly the LDL , '' Dr. Connor explains . The Tarahumaran diet averages a very low CSI of 20 ; Dr. Connor 's `` affluent '' diet used in the study ranks a CSI of 149 . The experimental design of this study reflects the importance of establishing baseline plasma lipid levels , typical of the native diet , before exposing subjects to the experimental diet . The standard curve relating dietary food intake to plasma cholesterol demonstrates a leveling off , or plateau , for consumption of large amounts of fat . Changes in dietary fat and/or cholesterol in this range have little effect on plasma levels . `` You must have the baseline diet almost free of the variables you are going to put into the experimental diet . The Framingham study , for example , did not discriminate on the basis of diet between individuals who got heart disease because the diet was already high in fat . All subjects were already eating on a plateau , '' Dr. Connor says . After 5 weeks of consuming the `` affluent '' diet , the subjects ' mean plasma cholesterol levels had in creased by 31 percent , primarily in the LDL fraction , which rose 39 percent . HDL-cholesterol increased by 31 per cent , and LDL to HDL ratios changed therefore very little . Plasma triglyceride levels increased by 18 percent , and subjects averaged an 8-pound gain in weight . According to Dr. Connor , lipid changes occurred surprisingly soon , yielding nearly the same results after 7 days of affluent diet as after 35 days . HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 21 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 The increase in HDL carries broad dietary implications for industrialized nations . `` We think HDL-cholesterol increased because we increased the amount of dietary fat over the fat content used in the previous Tarahumara metabolic study . In that study we saw no change in HDL levels after raising the dietary cholesterol but keeping the fat relatively consistent with native consumption . In the present study we increased fat intake to 40 percent of the total calories . We reached the conclusion in the Tarahumara study that HDL reflects the amount of dietary fat in general and not the amount of dietary cholesterol . HDL must increase to help metabolize the fat , and it increased quite a bit in this study , '' Dr. Connor explains . Low HDL in the Tarahumarans is not typically an important predictor of coronary heart disease because they do not normally consume large amounts of fat or cholesterol . HDL remains an important predictor to Americans because of their usual high fat intake . Dr. Connor recommends a diet for Americans that contains less than 20 percent of total calories as fat , less than 100 mg of cholesterol , and a CSI around 20 , varying in accordance with caloric needs . Such a diet is low in meat and dairy fat , high in fiber . Dr. Connor also comments on recent suggestions that Americans adopt a `` Mediterranean-style '' diet . `` The original Mediterranean diet , in its pristine state , consisted of a very low intake of fat and very few animal and dairy products . We are already eating a lot of meat and dairy products . Simply to continue that pattern while switching to olive oil is not going to help the situation . '' The World Health Organization ( WHO ) is focusing much attention on the emergence of diseases such as coronary heart disease in nations and societies undergoing technological development . Dr. Connor says that coronary heart disease starts with a given society 's elite , who typically eat a different diet than the average citizen . `` If the pattern of afluence increases , the entire population will have have a higher incidence of coronary heart disease , which places a termendous health care burden on a society . WHO would like the developing countries to prevent coronary heart disease , so they can concentrate on other aspects of their economic development and on public health measures to improve general well-being , rather than paying for unnecessary , expensive medical technology , '' Dr. Connors says . `` The overall implication of this study is that humans can readily move their plasma lipids and lipoprotein values into a high-risk range within a very short time by an affluent , excessive diet . The present rate of coronary heart disease in the United States is 30 percent less than it was 20 years ago , so a lot has been accomplished . We are changing rapidly , '' he concludes .

That much should be obvious from looking at the traffic over the last few weeks . Therefore I conclude that the existence of personal attacks is irrelevant to any decision concerning whether to post . I suspect that Prof. Denning is actually using the attacks as an excuse for not posting , and that the real reason for the silence is that Clipper is not the sort of proposal any self-respecting cryptographer can support via reasoned argument . mathew -- '' If you want to have constructive discussions here , and more importantly , be taken seriously by your peers , you may wish to consider shaping up .

The rule book certainly does n't have a definiton or clarification , so it's possible to interpret the rule as saying that if the catcher has to alter his throw to avoid hitting the batter-runner , then again we have interference . You know , it seems that there is no way to apply this rule justly -- if the catcher ( or the pitcher , say Rob Dibble , for example ) throws toward first and hits the runner running inside the baseline , the fielder takes the chance of being ejected . Therefore he probably would throw around the runner or ( your scenario ) above him . You should note that in our American Legion League , ( which uses MLB rules ) we interpret the rule to say in this very circumstance there IS interference per rule 7.09 . RStimets

Image annotation software ============================= a. Touchup runs in Sunview and is pretty good . It reads in rasterfiles , but even if your image is n't normally stored in rasterfile format you could use screendump to make it a rasterfile . b. Idraw ( part of Stanford 's InterViews distribution ) can handle some image formats in addition to being a MacDraw like tool . I 'm not sure exactly what they are . You can ftp the idraw 's binary from interviews.stanford.edu . c. Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap ( xbm ) and X11 pixmap ( xpm ) formats . If the image you have is in formats other than xbm or xpm , you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm . Tgif 's sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu ( Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9 ) d. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS ( see below ) . This is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package . e. You might be able to get by with PBMPlus . pbmtext gives you text output bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image . f. 'ice ' requires Sun hardware running OpenWindows 3.It 's a PostScript-based graphical editor , and it 's available for anonymous ftp from Internet host eo.soest.hawaii.edu ( 128.171.151.12 ) .

It seems more a image processing system than a generic SciVi system ( IMHO ) Major elements are : - a visual programming language , which automatically exploits the inherent parallelism - a code generator which converts the graph to a standalone program Iconified libraries present a rich set of point , filter , io , transform , morphological , segmentation , and measurement operations . A flow library allows graphs to employ broadcast , merge , synchronization , conditional , and sequencing control strategies . WIT delivers an object-oriented , distributed , visual programming environment which allows users to rapidly design solutions to their imaging problems . Users can consolidate both software and hardware developments within a complete CAD-like workspace by adding their own operators ( C functions ) , objects ( data structures ) , and servers ( specialized hardware ) . WIT runs on Sun , HP9000/7xx , SGI and supports Datacube MV-20/200 hardware allowing you to run your graphs in real-time .

This was developed at the University of Colorado ( Boulder ) by some people working for Alex Goetz . You might try contacting them if you already have IDL or would be willing to buy it . It 's a few thousand dollars ( American ) I expect for IDL and the other should be free . Those are the general purpose packages I 've heard of , besides what TerraMar has . SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery . I 'm not sure how general purpose it is . You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask . I have another piece of software ( PCW ) that does PC and Walsh transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image modification ( you can compute an image using selected components ) . I've used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems , but for the best speed you need an external DSP card . It will work without it , but large images take quite a while ( 50-70 times as long ) to process . That 's a freebie if you want it '' `` My favorite is IDL ( Interactive Data Language ) from Research Systems , Inc. IDL is in my opinion , much better and infinitely easier . Its programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like . It handles the number-crunching very well , also . Personally , I like doing the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX ( or Mathematica , Igor , or even Excel on the Mac if it 's not too hairy ) , then bringing it over to NIH Image for the imaging part . I have yet to encounter any situation which that combination could n't handle , and the speed and ease of use ( compared to IRAF ) was incredible . By the way , it 's mostly astronomical image processing which I 've been doing . This means image enhancement , cleaning up bad lines/pixels , and some other traditional image processing routines . Then , for example , taking a graph of intensity versus position along a line I choose with the mouse , then doing a curve fit to that line ( which I might do like in KaleidaGraph . ) `` [ For IDL call Research Systems , for PV-WAVE call Precision Visuals and for SIPS call University of Colorado @ Boulder .

SVLIB widgets are macro-widgets comprising lower level Motif widgets such as buttons , scrollbars , menus , and drawing areas . It is designed to address the reusability of 2D visualization routines and each widget in the library is an encapsulation of a specific visualization technique such as colormap manipulation , image display , and contour plotting . It is targetted to run on UNIX workstations supporting OSF/Motif . Currently , only color monitors are supported . Since SVLIB is a collection of widgets developed in the same spirit as the OSF/Motif user interface widget set , it integrates seamlessly with the Motif widgets . Programmers using SVLIB widgets see the same interface and design as other Motif widgets . FVS is a visualization software for Computational Fluid Dynamics ( CFD ) simulations . FVS is designed to accept data generated from these simulations and apply various visualization techniques to present these data graphically .

Many may think of GRASS as a Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package , although it is reported to have significant image processing capabilities . Feature Descriptions I use GRASS because it 's public domain and can be obtained through the internet for free . GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C. The source code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass Integration . You then compile the source code for your machine , using scripts provided with GRASS . I would recommend GRASS for someone who already has a workstation and is on a limited budget . GRASS is not very user-friendly , compared to Macintosh software . '' A first review of overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose image enhancement routines ( fft ) . Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in Boulder , CO is a primary user of GRASS . This gentleman has used the GRASS software and developed multi-spectral ( 238 bands ? ? ) volumetric rendering , full color , on Suns and Stardents . It was a really effective interface . Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps . You can call them at ( 303 ) 444-0094 or email care of greg @ vexcel.com 192.92.90.68 Host Configuration Requirements If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS on a Macintosh which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for satellite data . GRASS is public-domain , and can run on a high-end PC under UNIX . It is raster-based , has some image-processing capability , and can display vector data ( but analysis must be done in the raster environment ) . I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it easy to use . It is best , of course , for data that are well represented in raster ( grid-cell ) form .

Microstation Imager -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Intergraph ( based in Huntsville Alabama ) sells a wide range of GIS software/hardware . Microstation is a base graphics package that Imager sits on top of . Imager is basically an image processing package with a heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor . Feature Description Basic geometry manipulations : flip , mirror , rotate , generalized affine . Rectification : Affine , 2nd , 3rd , 4th and 5th order models as well as a projective model ( warp an image to a vector map or to another image ) . RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion . Principal component analysis . Classification : K-means and isodata . Fourier Xforms : Forward , filtering and reverse . Filters : High pass , low pass , edge enhancing , median , generic . Complex Histogram/Contrast control . Layer Controller : manages up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band image or create color images by combining various individual bands , etc . The package is designed for a remote sensing application ( it can handle VERY LARGE images ) and there is all kinds of other software available for GIS applications . Host Configuration Requirements It runs on Intergraph Workstations ( a Unix machine similar to a Sun ) though there were rumors ( there are always rumors ) that the software would be ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment . PCI -- - A company called PCI , Inc. , out of Richmond Hill , Ontario , Canada , makes an array of software utilities for processing , manipulation , and use of remote sensing data in eight or ten different `` industry standard '' formats : LGSOWG , BSQ , LANDSAT , and a couple of others whose titles I forget . The software is available in versions for MS-DOS , Unix workstations ( among them HP , Sun , and IBM ) , and VMS , and quite possibly other platforms by now . I use the VMS version . The `` PCI software '' consists of several classes/groups/packages of utilities , grouped by function but all operating on a common `` PCI database '' disk file . The `` Tape I/O '' package is a set of utility programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape formats INTO , or write those formats out FROM , the `` PCI database '' file ; this is the only package I use or know much about . Other packages can display data from the PCI database to one or another of several PCI-supported third-party color displays , output numeric or bitmap representation of image data to an attached printer , e.g . an Epson-type dot-matrix graphics printer . You might be more spe- cifically interested in the mathematical operations package : histo- gram and Fourier analysis , equalization , user-specified operations ( e.g . `` multiply channel 1 by 3 , add channel 2 , and store as channel 5 '' ) , and God only knows what all else -- there 's a LOT . I do n't have and don't use these , so ca n't say much about them ; you only buy the packages your particular application/interest calls for . Each utility is controlled by from one to eight `` parameters , '' read from a common `` parameter file '' which must be ( in VMS anyway ) in your `` default directory . '' Some utilities will share parameters and use the same parameter for a different purpose , so it can get a bit confusing setting up a series of operations . The standard PCI environment contains a scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC , but which allows you to automate the process of setting up parameters for a common , complicated , lengthy or difficult series of utility executions . ( In VMS I can also invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure . ) There's also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled language programs which can interface with ( read from/write to ) the PCI data structures ( database file , parameter file ) . The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images , but requires such a level of operator expertise that , once you reach the level where you can handle r-s images , you can figure out ways to handle a few other things as well . For instance , the Tape I/O package offers a utility for reading headerless multi-band ( what Adobe PhotoShop on the Macintosh calls `` raw '' ) data from tape , in a number of different `` interleave '' orders . This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the graphic-arts industry 's `` CT2T '' format , would probably ( I have n't tried ) handle Targa , and so on . Above all , however , you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT YOU 'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start over . It 's worth noting that the PCI `` database '' file is designed to contain not only `` raster '' ( image ) data , but vectors ( for overlaying map information entered via digitizing table ) , land-use , and all manner of other information ( I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often contains all manner of information about the spectral bands , latitude , longitude , time , date , etc . of the original satellite pass ; all of this can go into the PCI `` database '' ) . I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used . On VAX systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific third-party display systems ( the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to mind ) . One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would display directly from a PCI `` database '' file to a Peritek VCT-Q ( Q-bus 24-bit DirectColor ) display subsystem . PCI software COULD be `` overkill '' in your case ; it seems designed for the very `` high end '' applications/users , i.e . those for whom a Mac/PC largely does n't suffice ( although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time ) . It's probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada , a country which does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing ; I believe the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these areas . SPAM ( Spectral Analysis Manager ) -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM ( Spectral Analysis Manager ) which got a fair amount of use at the time . That was designed for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery ( byte data , < = 256 pixels across by < = 512 lines by < = 256 bands ) ; a modified version has since been developed for AVIRIS ( Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer ) which uses much larger images . Spam does none of these things ( rectification , classification , PC and IHS transformations , filtering , contrast enhancement , overlays ) . Actually , it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement ( stretching ) . Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering . The original Spam uses X or SunView to display . The AVIRIS version may require VICAR , an executive based on TAE , and may also require a frame buffer . I can refer you to people if you 're interested . PCW requires X for display . MAP II -- -- -- Among the Mac GIS systems , MAP II is distributed by John Wiley . CLRview -- -- -- - CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers . This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources . It supports the integration of many common but disperate data sources such as DXF , TIN , DEM , Lattices , and Arc/Info Coverages among others . CLRview can be obtained from explorer.dgp.utoronto.ca ( 128.100.1.129 ) in the directory pub/sgi/clrview .

Of course the chances of Ok It is for a game that is 3d and you have listed the characteristics that you are looking for . I think you may have left out a few important parameters . The polygons are all convex . They have less than N sides . ( you are drawing meshes walls doors etc . ) I believe that the algorithms you can get that will only draw convex polygons can be much more efficient than those that can draw concave / self intersecting polygons . This efficiency can largely be attributed to the fact that simple convex polygons only have a left and a right edge on each scan line . Complex ( figure 8 type polygons ) can be a bit trickier . The less than N sides specification especially if it is a very small number like 3 or 4 allow othe optimisations to be made . Thus for a high speed game application I think you are looking for code that exploits and is hence limited to drawing simple convex polygons . > finding something like that are pretty remote , so I guess I 'd need the source > with it .

Henry Spencer ( henry @ zoo.toronto.edu ) wrote : : If you 're doing large-scale satellite servicing , being able to do it in : a pressurized hangar makes considerable sense . The question is whether : anyone is going to be doing large-scale satellite servicing in the near : future , to the point of justifying development of such a thing . That 's a mighty fine idea . But since you asked `` Why not , '' I'll respond . Putting aside the application of such a space dock , there are other factors to consider than just pressurized volume . Temperature control is difficult in space , and your inflatable hangar will have to incorporate thermal insulation ( maybe a double-walled inflatable ) . Micrometeoroid protection and radiation protection are also required . Do n't think this will be a clear plastic bubble ; it 's more likely to look like a big white ball made out of the same kind of multi-layer fabric that soft-torso space suits are made out of today . Because almost all manned space vessels ( Skylab , Mir , Salyut ) used their pressurization for increased structural rigidity , even though they had ( have ) metal skins , they still kind of qualify as inflatable . The inflation process would have to be carefully controlled . The space environment reduces ductility in exposed materials ( due to temperature extremes , monotomic Oxygen impingement , and radiation effects on materials ) , so your `` fabric '' may not retain any flexibility for long . ( This may not matter . ) Even after inflation , pressure changes in the hangar may cause flexing in the fabric , which could lead to holes and tears as ductility decreases . These are some of the technical difficulties which the LLNL proposal for an inflatable space station dealt with to varying degrees of success . -- Ken Jenks , NASA/JSC/GM2 , Space Shuttle Program Office kjenks @ gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov ( 713 ) 483-4368 `` Good ideas are common -- what 's uncommon are people who'll work hard enough to bring them about .

If the fan should stop ( burn out ) how would you ever know this before the cpu goes up in smoke . Thats what you should be thinking about . I have the parts together but have not had the time to assemble them as yet .

From : tony @ minster.york.ac.uk Subject : Re : Revelations - BABYLON ? Organization : Department of Computer Science , University of York , England Lines : 37 Woo ! So far , we 've had the following interpretations of the figure of the ` Whore of Babylon ' in Rev 17 & 18 : a ) The United States of America b ) MHO dB ) which was as a figure of the fallen spiritual powers who corrupt and oppress human society c ) Historical Jerusalem d ) Historical Rome Dare I suggest that the passage might be many layered in meaning ? How about * The prophecy reveals God 's judgement on the corrupt & idolatrous state oppressing his chosen people ( d ) * That God 's judgement extends _especially_ to his once chosen city ( c ) because , despite that City's special call , it still rejected God 's grace at the decisive time ( Rev 11:8 ? - also is n't Rev19:24 equally suggestive of Rome as Jerusalem ? ) * That the USofA is guilty of many of the crimes of Rome/Babylon ( a ) and is equally subject to God 's judgement * That the Good Book ( TM ) actually encompasses _all_ these viewpoints by revealing the corrupting spiritual powers warring against mankind through the very society that we've created . ( b ) Clever , huh ? ( < -- Flame here ! ) No need to argue at all ! I think Mary 's view has a lot of sense because there seems to be a deliberate contrast between Rev 17/18 and Rev 21/22 - the mortal Jerusalem chosen by God but never ( historically ) fulfilling its vocation and the new Jerusalem perfected ( outside of history ) purely by God's grace . eg Details like Rev 17:1 ` .. who sits on many waters ' cf Rev 22 the single stream in the new Jersualem ` the river of life flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb . ' Rex - did n't understand your post - what 's the relevance of Babylonian mystery religions to all this ? Please elaborate your ideas about OT & the Book of Rev ? Why do you freak at the idea of a primarily ` spiritual' interpretation of Rev ?

From : ez019654 @ othello.ucdavis.edu ( Victoria Milliron ) Subject : Re : How to the disks copy protected . Organization : University of California , Davis X-Newsreader : Tin 1.1 PL3 Lines : 29 Hmmm ... A possibility for the software registration conondrum would be to have the distributor register the copy when the software was sold . The clerk sticks it in the store PC and asks for the buyers ID . Later , if pirated versions showed up they could be tracked to the original purchaser . In addition copies which were sent to distributors/stores would have a vendor reg # or serial # in order to track in store piracy . Possible additional program security schemes would be : 1. having monthly password changes which necessitate user call in and registration . ( inconvenient ) 2. taking dire legal action on anyone caught ( expensive ) 3. encryption , crc check , self modifying code ( limited effectiveness ) 4. have an independent watchdog program in the installation/setup config or memory manager , etc . which would check the main program 's crc . ( only as effective as above methods at best . ) 5. have the above watchdog circulating as a virus which would trash cracked copies of the program and/or the offenders hard drive . ( risky , and probably illegal , certainly immoral ) my new ideas are n't terribly feasible to implement as presented , but I thought if I threw them out people could think of variations that might be effective . What is the problem with parallel port security keys ? I have n't used anything that had hardware key copy protection schemes , so I do n't know what the drawbacks are . I know the companies that make them claim they 're uncrackable , but I 've seen cracks of AutoDesk 3d-studio floating around ( I do n't have one so do n't ask ) and I had heard that it had parralel port keys . vamilliron @ othello.ucd.edu -my apologies if I rambled , but vi inhibits my communication skills greatly .

If anyone knows what can be causing this , please let me know . Most likely reason is that your backup battery is failing - this battery maintains the contents of the CMOS memory when AC power is turned off , and if the battery is flakey then the contents of the CMOS will be lost and the checksum will be wrong ( along with most other of the CMOS data ) . Try replacing the battery . If , however , your PC does n't use a battery but a large capacitor to power the CMOS , you should check to see if you can replace the capacitor with a more normal lithium battery . If this is n't possible , make sure you leave your PC on for a half hour or hour each day ; this will keep the capacitor charged . I 'd opt for the battery change , though . It 's also possible , but unlikely that a rogue problem or even a virus is corrupting the CMOS . If your battery seems okay , get a virus scanner and check out your system .

You should n't have ignored the ZyXEL . It can be purchased with a `` Mac bundle '' , which includes a hardware-handshaking cable and FaxSTF software . The bundle adds between $ 35 and $ 60 to the price of the modem , depending on the supplier . It is true that the modem has no Mac-specific docs , but it does n't require much 'tweaking ' ( aside from setting & D0 in the init string , to enable hardware handshaking ) . For more information on the ZyXEL , including sources , look at various files on sumex-aim.stanford.edu , in info-mac/report .

They were left in their places that they needed to be . One in the riding lawnmower ( what a lux ) and one in each motorcycle . The battery in the riding lawnmower was about 3-4 years old , and one of the cycle batteries was new , and one was around 5 years old . Upon spring time , I discovered that all of the batteries were dead , and needed to be recharged . They all worked properly , except for the older ones , and they had to be replaced about halfway through the summer . ( they had originally been stored in the garage , and I think I remember my dad charging them in spring ) Last year , I decided to bring them in to the basement , which has two parts . one is dirt and brick , and the other is concrete . I brought in all three , and discovered in the spring , ( about 15 days ago ) that not only were the batteries dead , but when I put the charger on them , the charger said `` HMMMMMMMM '' and the amp-meter read around 1,000,000,000 ( In other words , it was pinned ) the internal circut tripped , and I went on to the other batteries . They were the same . Realizing that we still had 2 GIGANTIC sailboat batteries , also lead acid , I decided to put the charger on them . ( these had been sitting for around 1 and a half years , on the brick and dirt part ) and noticed that they only needed a small charge , around 2 hours or so on trickle . I tested them by using them at the local gas station for giving jump starts , and they worked fine for around 25 of 'em . This leads me to believe one of several things . 1 ) I bought really # $ % tty batteries last year . ( sorta true ) 2 ) the concrete has something to do with the discharge of the batteries . 3 ) There was enough moisture to short out the terminals in the room where the concrete is , 4 ) The dirt room was able to absorb the moisture in the air better than concrete . ( BTW , I can almost waterski in the dirt room ) Any other ideas ? *could be the aliens , anything is possible . *

Brian , have you checked out what your priests told you in the Bible to see whether they were telling you the truth ? Did you know that according to the Bible , there should n't even be such things as '' priests '' anymore ? Do you know why the preisthood was established in the Old Testament to begin with and the reasons why after Jesus , there were no priests -- that is until the Roman Catholic Church 300 years later devised the doctrine of transubstantiation by ignoring the whole concept beyond the book of Hebrews ? You said you analyzed the Bible very closely . I think you are lying . For if you had , I would think you would have at least got the doctrine of hell straight . So what is your beef against Jesus ? Be specific and point on verses .

This was arranged by Jets GM Mike Smith while Tod was playing in Moncton at about the time all those European players were coming over to North America to play in the NHL . Tod spent a year playing in Russia and played with or against some of the Russian players who have just entered the NHL in the last two years .

First a general description of the machine as follows : Motherboard : Utron 33 mhz Opti chipset , 20 meg memory , 256kb cache ( soon I hope to drop a DX2 chip into it ) Fahrenheit 1280 video ( 1 meg , 1024x768x256 ) ProAudio Spectrum 16 sound board primary disk = Connor CP30174 on a caching IDE controller secondary disk = Conner CP30174 as slave on same controller tertiary disk = Fujitsu ? ? ? 650 meg on Superstore ESDI controller planned future disks include SCSI HD and CD ROM on PAS16 SCSI port Tape drive is a Colorado Jumbo 250 on the Floppy controller future tape drive may be a DAT on the SCSI interface . Other hardware includes modem/fax , serial ports , and a teletext board ( ugly dos software drives the latter ) Applications used include normal windows stuff ( excel , word , Quicken and Turbo Pascal/Windows ) but the important stuff is my Audio work environment which includes Turtle beach Wave for Windows , MCS Stereo , and other misc stuff for dinking around with audio files . Also I use Stacker on the primary drive , HP Newwave ( for my wife 's use , and she wo n't let me get rid of it ! ) , and a product called Infinite Disk from Chili Pepper Software for hierarchical storage management of my seldom used offline files . I plan to upgrade to NT , when it becomes a released product . I was stongly tempted to become a beta user early on , but I do n't have time to mess around with the hassles of beta software . I expect to buy it , tear off the shrink wrap , and use it without hassle ( I know , unrealistic , but I can hope ca n't I , after all , I have work to do ) . The advice I want concerns the state of NT regarding device drivers , and hardware specific stuff in general . How smoothly can I expect the upgrade to go ? Can I expect support for all my stuff , or do I still need to scramble around downloading drivers ( PAS ? , Orchid ? , Colorado ? ) from some bbs , etc . What steps should I take to ensure the installation goes smoothly . Note that I want to nuke dos totally from the system . I'm allergic to command lines ! I plan to run a `` pure '' NT system . Also , will NT communicate with the workgroups lan ? What about stacker ? I currently have stacker on the first disk drive . Without Stacker , and the Infinite Disk product , I will have great difficulty fitting everything I have on the system ( It 's cramped now ) . I realize Stacker will be incompatible with NT , but will there be an NT version ? Or will NT support compression a la Dos 6 ? I know Infinite Disk will be incompatible with NT , but will they offer ( or does anybody else ) a comparable product for NT and at what cost ? ( perhaps I need to ask Chili Pepper that question ) I can live without ID if I have to , but I'd rather not . Will NT run my DOS apps ( the teletext board mainly ) without DOS on the system ? What do I need to keep around ? Any feedback or advice ( including `` forget NT '' with good reasons ) is much appreciated . My only significant reason for moving to NT is I need a better multitasking environment than Windows ( among other reasons , WAVE locks up the machine for hours and hours doing DSP processing on large audio files ) , and I want better lan support than I now have ( Internet access , etc ) . Maybe there are better solutions than NT and if so , I would appreciate hearing about them ( OS/2 ? What 's it 's status these days ? ) Pls respond by email and if there is interest I 'll summarize for the net . Thanks , Nathan Gregory p00211 @ psilink.com

It is not the result of religion , it is the result : of people knowing or firmly believing in an idea and one 's desire to show : others of one 's rightness . I assume that God decided to be judge for our : sake as much as his own , if we allow him who is kind and merciful be the : judge , we 'll probably be better off than if others judged us or we judged : ourselves . I 'm not sure I agree with this 100 % . I agree that arrogance is not the result of religion and that God is a far better judge than we are . I also agree if you mean to say that arrogance shows up in the form of trying to prove one's superior knowledge , rightness , or holiness over another person 's beliefs . I need to be careful to understand what you mean here so that I do not fall into the mistake of misrepresenting your views . If I fall down in this area I hope you will forgive me . Arrogance is not the result of believing one is right or of believing that one 's God is greater than the god 's of others or of believing that one's religion is better than other religions . These are all naturally self-implied beliefs . It is self-contradictory to say that I believe my current beliefs to be wrong . Were I to find myself in error , my beliefs would naturally change and follow what I believe to be right . Therefore , I must always consider my beliefs correct . That 's not arrogance . That 's unavoidable behavior . It is nonsense to say that I believe another person 's god to be greater than my God . Were his or her god greater , would n't I be obligated to change so that their god would become my God ? We are naturally obligated to worship that God which we deem to be the greatest . Why should we feel obligated to worship a second best god for the sake of feeling humble ? Arrogance is not necessarily thinking onesself to be better looking or more intelligent or stronger or having more resources than another person . No doubt many will have to chew on this one awhile . Were passive observation of one 's superior points arrogance , then God would be most arrogant of all . Humility does not rest in slandering or belittling God 's work of creation in our lives . People often go around trying to be humble saying to one another , '' I 'm not very smart . I 'm poor . I 'm not good looking . I 'm just a worm in the ground . I 'm such a weak person and although I do n't want to sin , I really can not help it . '' Were this person truely humble , he would take a different approach . `` God , thank you for making me the way you did . I know that you never do anything second best . Yet with all that you have given me , I have been so unthankful . You 've given me power to resist the devil . I have not used it but have indulged myself in doing exactly what you have said not to do . I have slandered your creation in my life and have credited myself with humility for doing so . Lord , with all you 've given me , I have been completely unfaithful and I do not deserve your forgiveness . And , yet Your love for me is so boundless that you would give Yourself to die for me to save me . As terribly evil as I am , I deserve to go straight to hell , yet it pleases you somehow to rescue me from this terrible life I 've led . Lord , please forgive me and help me stay on the right track so that I can bring glory to Your Name instead of insult . Lord I 'm so sorry for my wrongs . Please help me to change . '' : : I think people take exceptional offense to religious arrogance because : they do n't want to be wrong . If I find someone arrogant , I typically : do n't have anything to do with them . For me , I 've often found it hard to tell the difference . Often times , the most humble christian has come across to me as arrogant while the most proud `` worm in the ground '' false humility type person has been found to be most comfortable company . When I 'm wrong and arrogant about my wrongness , I certainly do n't feel like being confronted by my wrongness . Were someone to confront me verbally with my wrongness , I 'd be likely to snap at them and examine them head to toe for all their faults and charge them with hypocricy for what they said to me . At the root , my desire would be to make them shut up so that I can go about living my life arrogantly as I wish . However , were someone to confront me silently by their example , earn my respect , and perhaps mention it to me in humility in private , I 'd feel broken down and challenged to seek God for help in changing from the error of my ways . The hard part is getting to the point to where I can be humble before anyone regardless of their humility or pride -- regardless of their hypocricy or sincerity -- regardless of whether onlookers will frown down upon me or not . It is n't easy to take this pain in love with thankfulness for the opportunity to improve in one 's ability to serve God . It 's easier to cast aside any hope of reaching true humility and merely hide behind slandering God 's creation in our lives instead . : But we should examine ourselves [ I hope I typed this back in right ] : and why we react to certain situations with such emotions . For instance , : many of us feel `` justified '' to be insulted by an arrogant person . As if : we needed a reason to feel insulted . But after being insulted over and : over again by the words of others , you 'd think we 'd either toughen up : or decide not to be insulted , or ignore the insult . Just because you : can justify feelings of anger or insult or outrage , that does n't make that : reaction the appropriate one . It is in this light of self-examination : that we can change our emotional reactions . : Sometimes it helps when we can understand and feel the difference between what is a true statement of our character and what is a false and slanderous statement of our character . The devil is the accuser of the bretheren . He would love us to feel hopelessly guilty where we are innocent and feel arrogant and self-righteous where we are indeed wrong . The devil 's aim is to get us into as much misery as he can . Just think of the devil as a cruel and merci- less criminal who torments a parent by burning his or her children with hot irons .

What I see going on right now is a major > extinction event , and it is n't clear to me that the diversity 10K years > ago was necessarily greater than 600 million years ago . Well , there are several bursts in species diversity I can think of . The Cambrian and Ordovician explosions resulted in a vast increase in animal diversity . Likewise , after the one-two punch of the Permian and Triassic extinctions , the number of marine animals rose steadily ( ** ) to an all-time high ( * ) just prior to the spread of humans . ( ** ) biggest exception being the K/T ( bye bye dinos ) extinction ( * ) about 800 families Also , plants arose from green algae and colonized the land in succesive sweeps . Mosses colonized very wet environments first , ferns ( who had evolved vascular tissues ) took over more territory when they evolved ( 1 ) . These were eventually ( mostly ) replaced by gymnosperms ( pines and the like ) ( 2 ) and then ( mostly ) displaced by angiosperms ( flowering plants -- now the dominant plant group on the planet ( 3 ) . Fungi also radiated greatly with the invasion of the land . ( 1 ) around the carboniferous ( up to about 200 families ) ( 2 ) around the triassic ( up to maybe 250 families ) ( 3 ) starting in the cretaceous ( rising to about 600 families currently ) It 's unclear ( to me at least ) what the max equilibrium number of species the earth can hold ( *** ) and if it has ever hit this in the past . It could be ( warning : speculation alert ) that diversity has never reached a peak because mass extinctions happen often enough to keep the total number down . ( *** ) This would depend a great deal on how fragmented specific ecosystems were . See Cowen 's book `` History of Life '' for a not-too-technical run-down on , well , like the title sez , the history of life . Or see , Wilson 's `` Diversity of Life '' for a view centered more on current ecology -- this is ( IMHO ) the best popular biology book of ( what the hell , I 'll say it ) all time . > James Nicoll Follow-ups to t.o .

It seems you lived a fairly 'wild life ' -- my background is far more traditional , mostly working , working , working . Maybe there 's a clear indication that the way you lived your life produced a certain amount of anxiety that needed to be released . Religion was one possible medicine .

When it is cold , the hole is open enough to open the valve just enough to allow gas to the carbs with the choke on , since the choke creates more low pressure in the carbs when on to draw gas , and as the engine and surrounding area warm up , the hole seals up . One way to check fuel flow through the valve would be to pull the side panels off and remove the fuel hose to the carbs . Connect a tube of the correct size , preferably clear tubing to observe fuel flow , on the output side of the fuel petcock . Remove the control hose from # 1 carburator . Make sure the tank is full . Place the valve in the ON position and apply vacuum to the control hose , preferably with a vacuum device with a gauge , to check for air leaks . With vacuum applied , fuel should flow freely . To see if there is a vent problem , do this with the fuel filler cap open and closed , if it flows a lot faster with the filler cap open , then there may be something in the vent airway which changes position and depending on the position may clog or partially clog the vent . I have heard of some F2 fuel tanks being replaced to fix this problem . So the things which might be defective are , the control hose from # 1 carb , the petcock valve , and possibly the fuel tank vent . Now if all of the above shows no problem of fuel flow when cold , then there is something in the carbs screwed up , but there are so many things to check , I would be typing all day to list them all ! Here are a few , with everything back together , apply vacuum to the petcock valve and open the drain holes on the carbs one by one to check fuel flow . Open up the airbox and check for foreign debris or clogged airways on the carbs , there are quite a few on each carb . I hope something is flushed out with all this trouble shooting . If American Honda does not resolve this , get MAD AS HELL and report them to the BBB and call the Honda Customer Service HOTLINE . It is a 800 number , but I do n't recall it off the top of my head . I called just about tires for my F2 and a few days later a customer satisfaction inquiry card arrived at home asking how I liked the support I received , here would be your chance to tell them what you think ! Buy the service manual on the F2 , it is an invaluable source of information for working on your bike and I might add , trouble shooting !

Andrew Byler ) > Does anyone now where an English translation of the long recension of > the Acts of the Apostles can be found ? 1 ] An english translation of this can be found in : `` The Acts of the Apostles , translated from the Codex Bezae , with an introduction on its Lucan Origin and Importance '' , J. M. Wilson ( London , 1923 ) . 2 ] Another work that might be useful is : `` The Acts of the Apostles , a Critical Edition with Introduction and Notes on Selected Passages '' , Albert C. Clark ( Oxford , 1933 ; reprinted 1970 ) . ( This is an edition of text of Acts that makes the assumption that the text in Codex Bezae is the more authentic . I do n't know if it actually contains an english translation or not . ) 3 ] Another useful that discusses many of the variants in detail is : `` The Theological Tendency of the Codex Bezae Cantabrigiensis in Acts '' , Eldon J Epp ( Cambridge , 1966 ) . 4 ] The most recent reference I found was an edition in French from the early '80s . ( I can supply the reference if anyone 's interested . ) 5 ] Now , many of the works are going to be difficult to find . So if you 're interested in examining the differences in the long recension an excellent ( and easily obtainable ) discussion can be found in : `` A Textual Commentary on the Greek NT '' , Bruce Metzger ( United Bible Society , 1971 ) . Metzger 's book serves as a companion volume to the UBS 3rd edition of the Greek NT . It contains a discussion on the reasoning that went behind the decisions on each of the 1440 variant readings included in the UBS3 . Furthermore , notes on an addition 600 readings are included in aTCotGNT ( the majority of these occur in Acts ) . In particular in the introduction to the section on Acts Metzger writes : `` [ An attempt was made ] to set before the reader a more or less full report ( with an English translation ) of the several additions and other modifications that are attested by Western witnesses ... Since many of these have no corresponding apparatus in the text-volume , care was taken to supply an adequate conspectus of the evidence that supports the divergent readings . '' ( p 272 ) . > I understand that one of the early codexes , Vaticanus and Siniaticus has > this version of Acts . It would be interesting to know what the > differences are between the long and the short forms . 6 ] Most of the copies of the text of Acts that we have ( including the ones in Vaticanus and Siniaticus ) adher pretty closely to the shorter ( or Alexandrian ) version . The longer version to which you refer is usually called the `` Western '' version and its main witness is the Codex Bezae ( althought there are a few other rather fragmentary sources ) . 7 ] As far as size , the difference is that in Clark 's edition ( mentioned above ) the book of Acts contains 19,983 words whereas the text edited by Westcott and Hort ( a typical Alexandrian text ) contains 18,401 words ; i.e . a difference of about 8-1/2 % . 8 ] To answer the obvious questions , no , there are no major revelations in the longer text nor major omissions in the shorter text . The main difference seems to `` expansion '' of detail in the Western text ( or , if you prefer `` contractions '' in the Alexandrian ) . The Western text seems to be given to more detail . There are some interesting specific cases , but this probably not the place to go into it in detail . 9 ] The discussion over the years as to which of these versions is the more authentic has been hot and heavy . If there is anything approaching a modern consensus it is ( i ) that neither text represents purely the `` authentic '' version , ( ii ) each variant reading has to be examined on its own merits however , ( iii ) the variant in the Alexandrian text is the `` better '' more often than not .

After the seige began : Surround the place with Razor wire and then let them sit . Do not have daily press conferences , do your best to keep things out of the press . As things get more and more miserable inside , one of two things is going to happen : 1 . People will start coming out . 2 . They will commit suicide in mass at some point . The thing to remember about ( 2 ) is that hysterical situations and `` assults '' play into the hands of a `` leader '' who has picked this course . Its much easier to stampede people into something like suicide if there is gas coming in and bullets in the air . Let them be hungry and miserable for longer and longer and it will probably be more effective . The `` possiblity '' that they would all kill themselves at some point would not bother me in the least or alter tactics .

Well , suppose your mother was a crack addict and crack user/abuser while she was pregnant ? Suppose your husband gave you some SDT ( this recently happened to a close friend of my wife and mine ) ? OFTEN , the consequences of our sin are at least partially inflicted on innocent people . Several times in the OT , this is pointed out , even saying that descendants would suffer consequences for a person 's sin for several generations . Even today , we see multi-generational ( to coin a phrase ) effects from alcoholism , child abuse , and spousal abuse just to name three . So , God 's definition of fair and ours differ . Some points of perspective : Though the predisposition towards sinning is now inbred ( see Webster's first definition of inbred ) thanks to Adam , it is arrogant and foolish for any of us to think we would have done any different if we were in their shoes . I know myself pretty well , and I 'm just not that good . Take God 's word for it , neither are you . `` There is no one righteous ... '' More important , when a person decides to be a disciple of Jesus , God promises supernatural help in overcoming our physical self 's sinful tendency . We can , of course , choose to ignore this help . ( Rom 7,8 ) '' ... God made mankind upright , but men have gone in search of many schemes .

It 's 1024x768 , up to 72hz at that res , and it got a good write-up for image quality in a recent ( Feb. ? ) issue of PC Magazine . As far as I know , very little fully matches a NEC in image quality ( at least according to the mags -- I ca n't tell any difference between the two ! ) , but I think NEC is low emissions on only one of the two types . There 's VLF ( Very Low Frequency ) and ELF ( I think that's Extremely Low Frequency ) . The MPR-II standards set strict limits on both . But many comapnies , NEC included according to one article I read ( I get a bunch of mags so it 's hard for me to remember which ! ) , which claim `` low emissions '' but not specifically `` MPR-II Compliant '' or `` MPR-II Certified '' only control for one , usually VLF , and ignore the other . So , the NEC probably has higher overall image quality ( I consis- tently hear it rated as the best or close to the best ) , but not as low emissions as the Hitachi . I like my image quality , but for all I know you may be more discerning . Good luck ! - Mitch v063kcbp @ ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu ( Oh yeah : I got my Hitachi Superscan 15 from Insight for $ 499 . )

We have free will , and are able to change what happens to us . However , since God knows everything , He knows all the choices we will make `` in advance '' ( God is not subject to time ) . Too often arguments pit predestination against free will . We believe in both . That last sentence of Steve 's is an important one to remember . There are certain things in the Catholic religion that can not be completely comprehended by a human being . Were this not the case , it would be good evidence that the religion was man-made . In the case of predestination , you have to reconcile two things that would at first appear to be irreconcilable : the sovereignty of God's will over all things , and man 's free will in deciding his own fate . Catholics believe in both ! But that does n't mean that anyone has come up with a pat reconciliation ... I have often thought that Goedel 's famous theorem has applicability to Catholic dogma , at least in an analogous sense : there are things that are true that can not be proved . God 's intellect is far above ours . There are many truths that we will never be able to understand .

Leaving Erivan on April 28 , 1915 , Armenian volunteers reached Van on May 14 and organized and carried out a general slaughter of the local Muslim population during the next two days . '' `` Knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions , Armenians looked to Russia and Europe for the fulfillment of their aims . Armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the First World War with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse to serve their state , the Ottoman Empire , and to assist instead other invading Russian armies . Their hope was their participation in the Russian success would be rewarded with an independent Armenian state carved out of Ottoman territories . Armenian political leaders , army officers , and common soldiers began deserting in droves . '' `` With the Russian invasion of eastern Anatolia in 1914 at the beginning of World War I , the degree of Armenian collaboration with the Ottoman 's enemy increased drastically . Ottoman supply lines were cut by guerilla attacks , Armenian revolutionaries armed Armenian civil populations , who in turn massacred the Muslim population of the province of Van in anticipation of expected arrival of the invading Russian armies . '' `` ... Meanwhile , Czar Nicholas II himself came to the Caucasus to make final plans for cooperation with the Armenians against the Ottomans , with the president of the Armenian National Bureau in Tiflis declaring in response : 'From all countries Armenians are hurrying to enter the ranks of the glorious Russian Army , with their blood to serve the victory of Russian arms ... Let the Russian flag wave freely over the Dardanelles and the Bosporus . Let , with Your will , great Majesty , the peoples remaining under the Turkish yoke receive freedom . Let the Armenian people of Turkey who have suffered for the faith of Christ receive resurrection for a new free life under the protection of Russia .

I went through this just a few weeks ago ; here it comes again . The entire Turkish population of Armenia ( which Armenians called Tartars ) constituted at least about 40 % of the total population of Armenia was deliberately exterminated . ( For the population statistics , please look to the book of Richard Hovannessian , `` Armenia on the Road to Independence . '' ) I listed three books earlier of such a monstrous crime by the writings of one Armenian , one American , and one British . They are : `` Men Are Like That '' by Leonard R. Hartill ; `` Adventures in the Near East '' by A. Rawlinson ; `` World Alive , A Personal Story '' by Robert Dunn . Also , I personally have copies of documents of this crime by the writings of two Armenians and also one American . The official British report about this massacre mentioned in one of these documents ( Lord Curzon-Aharonin interview ) is the report of the British High Commissioner to Caucasia , Sir Oliver Wardrop . `` An appropriate analogy with the Jewish Holocaust might be the systematic extermination of the entire Muslim population of the independent republic of Armenia which consisted of at least 30-40 percent of the population of that republic . The memoirs of an Armenian army officer who participated in and eye-witnessed these atrocities was published in the U.S. in 1926 with the title 'Men Are Like That . ' Other references abound . '' ( Rachel A. Bortnick - The Jewish Times - June 21 , 1990 ) Need I go on ? Serdar Argic 'We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the Turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination .

For my money the primary danger of anti-cult groups is that they are every bit as wacky as the groups they oppose and that by and large they have no compunctions about printing lies , half-truths and misleading innuendos as part of their exposes . A recent book on cults I picked up by a `` Christian '' author quite simply mixed in all non-Christian religions ( except the Jews ) and various New Age groups with various fringe groups of dubious intent and legality . > On the other hand , the Watchman Fellowship does a good service in > exposing deceptive practices that are far too common among the > groups they monitor . Given the record of American Christianity , any group that falls into the category of fundamentalist or born-again is automatically into the Inquisition business . It is an unavoidable affliction of those who have a proprietary license on The Truth ( tm ) . And let 's not forget that Jonestown and the Branch Davidians are just as much a part of the Christian tradition as the Missouri Synod Lutherans , and may in fact be the Massadas of true Christian believers .

Protestants love to play up Jerome for all he is worth . They should remeber that after the Decree of Pope St. Damsus I , Jerome did not hesitate in accpeting the deuteroncanon , and quoted them as Scripture in his later writings . And as I have already pointed out , in a previous letter on this subject , the Catholic Church has accepted the deuterocanon from the beginning . And the Protestants in the 1500 's all of a sudden revived the old theory of some , condemned by Pope , Council , and Church , that the deuterocanon were not inspired .

This makes it tougher for opposing manager to change pitchers . ( 2 ) Having Bonds batting behind Williams means that Matt will get more good pitches to hit . This is important since he struggles so much with breaking balls . Opposing pitchers do n't want to walk Williams to get to Bonds . Edward Hui

That ( `` complicated '' ) is n't in fact where P ( H ) > P ( HG ) comes from ; it 's more the other way around . It 's from P ( H ) = P ( HG ) + P ( HG ' ) where G ' is the complement of G and by axiom , P ( anything ) > = 0 , so P ( HG ' ) > = 0 , so P ( H ) > = P ( HG ) . In a sense , HG is necessarily more `` complicated '' than H for any H and G , so I may be splitting hairs , but what I 'm trying to say is that irrespective of subjective impressions of how complicated something is , P ( H ) > = P ( HG ) holds , with equality if and only if P ( HG ' ) = 0 . > As you point out , it 's a very simple matter to show P ( x | H ) = P ( x | HG ) > == > P ( H | x ) > P ( HG | x ) , and thus H is to be preferd to HG . Now to say > that H is as consistent with the data as HG is to say P ( x | H ) = P ( x | HG ) . > Can you elaborate some on this . Well , `` P ( x | A ) = P ( x | B ) '' means that x is as likely to be observed if A is operative as it is if B is operative . This implies that observing x does not provide any useful information which might allow us to discriminate between the respective possibilities that A and B are operative ; the difference reduces to the difference between the ( unknown and unhelpful ) prior probabilities P ( A ) and P ( B ) : P ( x | A ) = P ( x | B ) == > P ( A | x ) = k P ( A ) , and P ( B | x ) = k P ( B ) where k = P ( x | A ) / P ( x ) = P ( x | B ) / P ( x ) . So A and B are `` equally consistent with the data '' in that observing x does n't give any pointers as to which of A or B is operative . In the particular case where A = H and B = HG , however , we know that their prior probabilities are ordered by P ( H ) > = P ( HG ) , although we do n't know the actual values , and it 's this which allows us to deploy the Razor to throw out any such HG . > Also , in the `` real world '' it is n't as clear cut and dry it seems > to me . We ca n't always determine whether the equality `` P ( x | H ) = > P ( x | HG ) '' is true . That 's certainly true , but the particular point here was whether or not a ` divine component ' actually underlies the prevalence of religion in addition to the memetic transmission component , which even the religious implicitly acknowledge to be operative when they talk of ` spreading the word ' . Now it seems to me , as I 've said , that the observed variance in religious belief is well accounted for by the memetic transmission model , but rather *less* well if one proposes a ` divine component ' in addition , since I would expect the latter to conspire *against* wide variance and even mutual exclusion among beliefs . Thus my *personal* feeling is that P ( x | HG ) isn't even equal to P ( x | H ) in this case , but is smaller ( H is memetic transmission , G is ` divine component ' , x is the variance among beliefs ) . But I happily acknowledge that this is a subjective impression . > BTW , my beef with your Baysian argument was not a mathematical one - > I checked most of your work and did n't find an error and you seem very > careful so there probably is n't a `` math mistake '' .

I think this is a reasonable > request - I always try to look for ways of explaining physics to > non-physicist . I 'm not a Baysian statistician ( nor any type of > statistician ) , so this would be very helpful . Not that I 'm a statistician as such either , but : The idea is that both theism and atheism are compatible with all of the ( read ` my ' ) observations to date . However , theism ( of the type with which I am concerned ) *also* suggests that , for instance , prayer may be answered , people may be miraculously healed ( both are in principle amenable to statistical verification ) and that god/s may generally intervene in measurable ways . This means that these regions of the space of possible observations , which I loosely termed `` appearances of god/s '' , have some nonzero probability under the theistic hypothesis and zero under the atheistic . Since there is only so much probability available for each hypothesis to scatter around over the observation space , the probability which theism expends on making `` appearances of god/s '' possible must come from somewhere else ( i.e . other possible observations ) . All else being equal , this means that an observation which *isn't* an '' appearance of god/s '' must have a slightly higher probability under atheism than under theism . The Bayesian stuff implies that such observations must cause my running estimate for the probability of the atheistic hypothesis to increase , with a corresponding decrease in my running estimate for the probability of the theistic hypothesis . Sorry if that 's still a bit jargonesque , but it 's rather difficult to put it any other way , since it does depend intimately on the properties of conditional probability densities , and particularly that the total area under them is always unity . An analogy may ( or may not : - ) be helpful . Say that hypothesis A is `` the coin is fair '' , and that B is `` the coin is unfair ( two-headed ) '' . ( I've used A and B to avoid confusion with H [ heads ] and T [ tails ] . ) Then P ( H | A ) = 0.5 } total 1 P ( T | A ) = 0.5 } P ( H | B ) = 1 } total 1 P ( T | B ) = 0 } The observations are a string of heads , with no tails . This is compatible with both a fair coin ( A ) and a two-headed coin ( B ) . However , the probability expended by A on making possible the appearance of tails ( even though they do n't actually appear ) must come from somewhere else , since the total must be unity , and it comes in this case from the probability of the appearance of heads . Say our running estimates at time n-1 are e [ n-1 ] ( A ) and e [ n-1 ] ( B ) . The observation x [ n ] at time n is another head , x [ n ] = H. The estimates are modified according to P ( H | A ) e [ n ] ( A ) = e [ n-1 ] ( A ) * -- -- -- -- = e [ n-1 ] ( A ) * m P ( H ) and P ( H | B ) e [ n ] ( B ) = e [ n-1 ] ( B ) * -- -- -- -- = e [ n-1 ] ( B ) * 2m P ( H ) Now we do n't know P ( H ) , the *actual* prior probability of a head , but the multiplier for e ( A ) is half that for e ( B ) . This is true every time the coin is tossed and a head is observed . Thus whatever the initial values of the estimates , after n heads , we have n e [ n ] ( A ) = m e [ 0 ] ( A ) and n e [ n ] ( B ) = ( 2m ) e [ 0 ] ( B ) , and since e [ k ] ( A ) + e [ k ] ( B ) = 1 at any time k , you can show that 0.5 < m < 1 and thus 1 < 2m < 2 . Hence the estimate for the fair-coin hypothesis A must decrease at each trial and that for the two-headed coin hypothesis B must increase , even though both hypotheses are compatible with a string of heads . The loose analogy is between `` unfair coin '' and atheism , and between `` fair coin '' and theism , with observations consistent with both . A tail , which would falsify `` unfair coin '' , is analogous to an `` appearance of god/s '' , which would falsify atheism . I am *not* claiming that the analogy extends to the numerical values of the various probabilities , just that the principle is the same . > > Constant observation of no evidence for gods , if evidence for them > ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ > > is at all possible under the respective theisms , constantly increases > ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ > > the notional estimated probability that they do n't exist , > It 's important to draw a distinction between theism that could > be supported or not supported by evidence and theism that ca n't . > Given a theism for which evidence is in principle not possible , > it does n't make sense to say `` lack of evidence '' supports the contrary > view . Quite so , but this type of theism is what I might call `` the G in the HG '' , in terms of our Ockham 's Razor discussion , and I 'd bin it on those grounds . > So it depends upon your conception of this god .

Such > is the case when H = Ht ( theistic ) and Ha ( atheistic ) . For example , > P ( x | Ha ) = P ( x & Ha ) /P ( Ha ) . What is P ( Ha ) ? ! ? How do I measure it ? You do n't have to . We do n't need , in the above analogy , to know *any* prior probabilities to deduce that the updating multiplier for the fair-coin hypothesis is less than unity , and that the corresponding multiplier for the two-headed coin hypothesis is greater than unity . You do n't need to know the initial values of the running estimates either . It 's clear that after a large number of observations , P ( fair-coin ) approaches zero and P ( two-headed-coin ) approaches unity . All you need to know is whether P ( x | Ha ) is larger than P ( x | Ht ) for observed x , and this follows from the assumptions that there are certain events rendered *possible* ( not necessary ) under Ht which are not possible under Ha , and all else is equal . > Baysian statistics relies upon a series of observations .

Any observations you like ; it really does n't matter , nor affect the reasoning , provided that there are some possible observations which would count as `` appearances of god/s '' .

OK , we 'll downgrade `` *does* interact '' to `` *may* interact '' , which would actually be better since `` does interact '' implies a falsifiability which we both agree is misplaced . > I do n't think my theism makes `` predictions '' . Maybe I 'm not > understanding what you mean by `` prediction '' - could you explain what > you mean by this word ? I 'll explain , but bear in mind that this is n't central ; all I require of a theism is that it *not* make the prediction `` Appearances of god/s will never happen '' , as does atheism . ( Before somebody points out that quantum mechanics does n't make this prediction either , the difference is that QM and atheism do not form a partition . ) Predictions include such statements as `` Prayer is efficacious '' ( implying '' If you do the stats , you will find that Prayer is efficacious '' ) , or `` Prayer is *not* efficacious '' , or `` Verily I say unto you , This generation shall not pass , till all these things be fulfilled .

First , a longer game in no way suggests `` more baseball to watch , '' unless you include watching the grass grow as baseball . The lengthier games are so because of batters stepping out of the box , pitchers taking longer between pitches and excessive trips to the mound by managers and pitching coaches . And while it 's true that the gaps between plays can be interesting , this is only true when they do n't become extra-long . Quickly-pitched games can grab and hold your attention much better .

I would estimate a couple of percents and if you are in a bigger town , there is none that can not handle tone dialing .

From : `` Matthew T. Keating '' < mk55+ @ andrew.cmu.edu > Subject : Bowman needs credit Organization : Freshman , IM - H & SS Track , Carnegie Mellon , Pittsburgh , PA Lines : 26 NNTP-Posting-Host : andrew.cmu.edu During the first three games of the Pens-Devils series , I have been impressed time and time again by the pure talent of the Pens . Jagr , MacEachern and Barrasso have been especially fun to watch . But , one element of this team which goes unnoticed seems to be Scotty Bowman . Despite Brooks ' lunatic comments , and despite the Devils ' line changing adantage in last night 's game , Bowman has been able to keep his cool and keep the Devils in the dark . Granted , the hell-dwellers had the Pens bottled up for a while last night , but Bowman was eventually able to configure his line-up to get the job done . His ability to throw out new looks and strategies at a moments notice is incredible . Bowman seems to have a terrific ability of reading his players on an individual basis . Last night , for instance , he realized that the speed of Jagr , Straka , and MacEachern was throwing the Devils off balance . As a result , Straka received many more shifts than average ; Jagr played almost the entire game ( he was always on the puck ) , and MacEachern scored a goal , while complementing Jagr many times throughout the night . His ability to commit to one player in crucial situations is commendable , especially when a coach of such a talented team might simply rely on the overall talent to dominate , and to bring about success . While no one can replace the genius and optimism of Badger Bob Johnson , Bowman , in his own way , has made himself a permanent , though not clearly seen , mark in Pittsburgh .

Note that both are legal , and a lot of `` common '' people qualify > for one or the other . > > -andy > -- Maybe Freeman did prove his point but his point is not relevant . The thing that most people seem to care about when they ask questions about carrying a concealed weapon is whether or not they can carry it concealed on their person when they are out on the street somewhere . I 'm sure that not many people are concerned with whether or not they can carry concealed at home . Speaking as someone who lives in Illinois ( the only place where the above quoted law is relevant : - ) ) I know that it is legal to own a handgun here ( I am not taking into account city ordinances ) . I could care less about whether or not I can carry concealed at home . I only care about the fact that I ca n't carry concealed in the place where it really counts- out on the street . Freeman loves to be accurate and I can understand that ( especially not ) but he seems to be forgetting that accurate facts do n't always replace common sense . I am not going to followup to this thread anymore because I believe that it is useless to argue these points anymore . The only thing that is happening now is that Freeman and I are `` running around in circles '' trying to prove each other wrong and I do not have the time to be playing games anymore . Of course now Freeman will attack me about my use of common sense in some of my earlier posts but what can I do . My only advice for Freeman - quit being so picky about accuracy sometimes and use your common sense ; it really does work some- times . Jason - u28037 @ uicvm.cc.uic.edu

It looks like it uses the same hardened steel as a Kryptonite U lock , but unlike a U lock , it is hinged in 5 places and opens out to a large rectangle ( longer length than any U lock I have seen , plus it folds down to real small ) , so you could lock the rear tire to a steel post for example .

I think the rest of the jury would have to kill you . `` There 's no way I can objectively judge the defendant to be innocent or guilty . You see , there are 2 billion other people on this planet . We have no way of knowing whether the defendant would have committed the crime if it wasn't for all the other people on the planet .

Can read TIFF images , if you know their dimensions [ PC and Macs ] LabVIEW 2 -- -- -- -- - LabVIEW is used as a framework for image processing tools . It provides a graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the `` program '' with graphical elements representing the programming elements . Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a wiring tool to create the block diagram ( program ) . Functions that the block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and filtering , numerical analysis , statistics , etc . The tool allows any Virtual Instrument ( VI , a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory instrument ) to be used as a part of any other virtual instrument . National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing ( DSP ) boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time acquisition and analysis at a personal computer . New software tools for DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology . The tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block diagram development software . There are three levels of DSP programming associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW : Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library : FFTs , power spectra , filters routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop ( MPW ) C that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board . There is an analysis Virtual Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300 . Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an optimizing C compiler , an assembler and a linker for low-level programming of the DSP hardware . This approach offers the highest level of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use . Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has utility functions for memory management data communications and downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board . ( This is the easiest route for the development of custom code . ) Ultimage Concept VI -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Concept VI by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual Instruments ( VIs ) that give LabVIEW 2 ( described above ) users high-end tools for designing , integrating and monitoring imaging control systems . A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory instrument . Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography , surveillance , machine vision , production testing , biomedical imaging , electronic microscopy and remote sensing . Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further qualitative and quantitative analysis . It includes a complete set of functions for image enhancement , histogram equalization , spatial and frequency filtering , isolation of features , thresholding , mathematical morphology analysis , density measurement , object counting , sizing and characterization . The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64 , a pixel depth of 8 , 16 , or 32 bits , and one image plane . Standard input and output formats include PICT , TIFF , SATIE , and AIPD . Other formats can be imported . Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations , spatial linear and non-linear filters , frequency filtering , arithmetic and logic operations , and geometric transformations , among others . Morphological transformations include erosion , dilation , opening , closing , hole removal , object separation , and extraction of skeletons , among others . Quantitative analysis provides for objects ' detection , measurement , and morphological distribution . Measures include area , perimeter , center of gravity , moment of inertia , orientation , length of relevant chords , and shape factors and equivalence . Measures are saved in ASCII format . The program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom modules . A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot . The histogram tool can be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale . The twenty-eight arithmetic and logical operations provide for : masking and averaging sections of images , noise removal , making comparisons , etc . There are 13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local intensity . These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines . The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as either the ( real , imaginary ) components or the ( phase , magnitude ) data . The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening and defining objects or for removing artifacts . The transformations include : thresholding , eroding , dilating and even hole filling . The program 's quantitative analysis measurements include : area , perimeter , center of mass , object counts , and angle between points .

MicroFrontier 7650 Hickman Road Des Moines , IA 50322 515-270-8109 Image Analyst -- -- -- -- -- -- - An image processing product for users who need to extract quantitative data from video images . Image Analyst lets users configure sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the necessity of knowing a programming language . It is designed for such tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video cameras attached to microscopes , or enhancing and measuring distances in radiographs . Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of instructions to enhance feature appearance ; count objects ; determine density , shape , size , position , or movement ; perform object feature extraction ; and conduct textural analysis automatically . Image Analyst works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera , or a disk-stored image . Within minutes , without the need for programming , the Image Analyst user can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image . Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images . Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size , shape and position . The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and Scion frame grabbers . A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices . There are 2 types of files , the image itself and the related Sequence file that holds the processing , measurements and analysis that the user defines . Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest ( ROI ) represented by movable , sizable boxes atop the image . Inside a ROI , the program can find the distance between two edges , the area of a shape , the thickness of a wall , etc . Image Analyst finds the center , edge and other positions automatically . The application also provides tools so that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object . It also supports histograms and a color look-up table ( CLUT ) tool .

Feature Description DISIMP incorporates a rich library of image processing utilities and spatial data options . All functions can be easily accessed via the DISIMP executive . This menu is modular in design and groups image processes by their function . Such a logical structure means that complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of modules . Processes include image rectification , classification ( unsupervised and supervised ) , intensity transformations , three dimensional display and Principal Component Analysis . DISIMP also supports the more simple and effective enhancement techniques of filtering , band subtraction and ratioing . Host Configuration Requirements Running on UNIX workstations , DISIMP is capable of processing the more computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times . DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer 's environments . Using the Programmers environment , utilities can be developed for specific applications programs . Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick enhancments of a displayed image . Manipulations of Look Up Tables , colour stretches , changes to histograms , zooming and panning can be interactively driven through this control . A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of image , graphic and textual types . Images can be rectified by a number of coordinate systems , providing the true geographic knowledge essential for ground truthing . Overlays of grids , text and vector data can be added to further enhance referenced imagery . The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels to determine their own working environment , including the amount of help required .

Been around for a number of years , sold to Weather Service and Navy . Runs on HP9000 with HP-UX . Supports 24-bit display '' HIPS -- -- ( Human Information Processing Laboratory 's Image Processing System ) Michael Landy co-wrote and sell a general-purpose package for image processing which has been used for basically all the usual image processing applications ( robotics , medical , satellite , engineering , oil exploration , etc. ) . It is called HIPS , and deals with sequences of multiband images in the same way it deals with single images . It has been growing since we first wrote it , both by additions from us as well as a huge user-contributed library . Feature description HIPS is a set of image processing modules which together provide a powerful suite of tools for those interested in research , system development and teaching . It handles sequences of images ( movies ) in precisely the same manner as single frames . Programs and subroutines have been developed for simple image transformations , filtering , convolution , Fourier and other transform processing , edge detection and line drawing manipulation , digital image compression and transmission methods , noise generation , and image statistics computation . Over 150 such image transformation programs have been developed . As a result , almost any image processing task can be performed quickly and conveniently . Additionally , HIPS allows users to easily integrate their own custom routines . New users become effective using HIPS on their first day . HIPS features images that are self-documenting . Each image stored in the system contains a history of the transformations that have been applied to that image . HIPS includes a small set of subroutines which primarily deals with a standardized image sequence header , and a large library of image transformation tools in the form of UNIX `` filters '' . It comes complete with source code , on-line manual pages , and on-line documentation . Host Configuration Requirements Originally developed at New York University , HIPS now represents one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image processing environments currently available . It runs under the UNIX operating system . It is modular and flexible , provides automatic documentation of its actions , and is almost entirely independent of special equipment . HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and Microvax , Sun , Apollo , Masscomp , NCR Tower , Iris , IBM AT , etc . For image display and input , drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and Adage ( Ikonas ) image processors , and the Sun-2 , Sun-3 , Sun- 4 , and Sun-386i consoles . We also supply user-contributed drivers for a number of other framestores and windowing packages ( Sun gfx , Sun console , Matrox VIP-1024 , ITI IP-512 , Lexidata , Macintosh II , X windowing system , and Iris ) . The Hipsaddon package includes an interface for the CRS-4000 . It is a simple matter to interface HIPS with other frame- stores , and we can put interested users in touch with users who have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max- Video . HIPS can be easily adapted for other image display devices because 98 % of HIPS is machine independent . Availability HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible system , both as an interactive research tool , and for more production- oriented tasks . It is both easy to use , and quickly adapted and extended to new uses . HIPS is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format ( either reel- to-reel or Sun cartridge ) , and comes with source code , libraries , a library of convolu- tion masks , and on-line documentation and manual pages .

These are altogether different beasts ! - nfotis ] MIRA stands for Microcomputer Image Reduction and Analysis . MIRA gives workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in 256 color modes up to 1024x768 . MIRA contains a very handsome/functional GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated . MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS formats , native formats of a number of CCD cameras , and uncompressed binary images in byte , short integer , and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2- dimensions . The result of an image processing operation can be short integer or real pixels , or the same as that of the input image . MIRA does the operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision and accuracy of the pixel format . Over 100 functions are hand-coded in assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware . The entire graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize the speed of windowing operations . Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value value in real time as you move the mouse . There are also smooth , real time contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of the displayed image ( s ) , all operated by the mouse . A wide selection of grayscale , pseudocolor , and random palettes is provided , and other palettes can be generated . Supported functions include such niceties as the following : o image & image : + - / * interpolation o image & constant : + - / * o unary operations : abs value , polynomial of pixel value , chs , 1/x , log , byteswap , clip values at upper/lower limits , short- > real or real- > short . o combine images by mean , median , mode , or sum of pixel values , with or without autoscaling to mean , median , or mode of an image section . o convolutions/filters : Laplacian , Sobel edge operator , directional gradient , line , Gaussian , elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters , unsharp masking , median filters , user defined filter kernel . Ellipse , rectangle , line , gradient , Gaussian , and user defined filters can be rotated to any specified angle . o CCD data reduction : flat fielding , dark subtraction , column over/underscan bias removal , remove bad pixels and column defects , normalize to region target mean , median , or modal value . o create subimage , mosaic m x n 1-d or 2-d images to get larger image , collapse 2-d image into 1-d image . o plot 1-d section or collapsed section of 2-d image , plot histogram of region of an image . o review/change image information/header data , rename keywords , plot keyword values for a set of images . o luminance/photometry : elliptical or circular aperture photometry , brightness profile , isophotal photometry between set of upper & lower luminances , area and luminance inside traced polygon . Interactive background fitting and removal from part or all of image , fit elliptical aperture shape to image isophotes . o interactive with 2-d image : contrast/brightness , x- y- or diagonal plot of pixel values , distance between two points , compute region stats , ` centroid , pan to x , y location or image center , zoom 1/16 to 10 times , change cursor to rectangle crosshair , full image crosshair , or off , and adjust cursor size on image . Select linear , log or gamma transfer function or histogram equalization . o interactive or specified image offset computation and re-sampling for registration . o interactive with 1-d image : zoom in x- y- or both in steps of 1/2 or 2 times current , re-center plot , or enlarge a framed area . 4 plot buffers can be cycled through .

If people who `` speak in tongues '' make claims that they are miraculously speaking a foreign language through the power of the Holy Spirit , when it can easily be shown that they are simply making noises , it damages all Christians , since many who are not Christians do not distinguish between the various sects . The more modest claim for `` tongues '' that it is simply uncontrolled praise in which `` words fail you '' is surely the one that should be used by those who make use of this practice . I agree with the point that `` Charismatic '' practices like this can lead to forms of worship which are more about the worshipper showing off than genuine praise for God ; one of the things Jesus warned us about .

One time , after several apparitions passed , The Lady finally said , `` I am the Immaculate Conception '' . So , Bernadette , was so happy and repeated these words over and over in her mind so as not to forget it before she told the priest who was asking . So , when she told the priest , the priest was shocked and asked Bernadette , `` Do you know what you are talking about ? '' . Bernadette did not know what exactly it meant but she was just too happy to have the answer for the priest . The priest continued with , `` How did you remember this if you do not know ? '' . Bernadette answered honestly that she had to repeat it over and over in her mind while on her way to the priest ... The priest knew about the dogma being four years old then . But Bernadette did not know and yet she had the answer which the priest finally observed and took as proof of an authentic personal revelation of Our Lady to Bernadette .

Between 1914 and 1920 , 2.5 million Turks perished of butchery at the hands of Armenians . The genocide involved not only the killing of innocents but their forcible deportation from the Russian Armenia . They were persecuted , banished , and slaughtered while much of Ottoman Army was engaged in World War I . The Genocide Treaty defines genocide as acting with a 'specific intent to destroy , in whole or in substantial part , a national , ethnic , racial or religious group . ' History shows that the x-Soviet Armenian Government intended to eradicate the Muslim population . 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were exterminated by the Armenians . International diplomats in Ottoman Empire at the time - including U.S . Ambassador Bristol - denounced the x-Soviet Armenian Government 's policy as a massacre of the Kurds , Turks , and Tartars . The blood-thirsty leaders of the x-Soviet Armenian Government at the time personally involved in the extermination of the Muslims . The Turkish genocide museums in Turkiye honor those who died during the Turkish massacres perpetrated by the Armenians . The eyewitness accounts and the historical documents established , beyond any doubt , that the massacres against the Muslim people during the war were planned and premeditated . The aim of the policy was clearly the extermination of all Turks in x-Soviet Armenian territories . The Muslims of Van , Bitlis , Mus , Erzurum and Erzincan districts and their wives and children have been taken to the mountains and killed . The massacres in Trabzon , Tercan , Yozgat and Adana were organized and perpetrated by the blood-thirsty leaders of the x-Soviet Armenian Government . The principal organizers of the slaughter of innocent Muslims were Dro , Antranik , Armen Garo , Hamarosp , Daro Pastirmadjian , Keri , Karakin , Haig Pajise-liantz and Silikian . Source : `` Bristol Papers '' , General Correspondence : Container # 32 - Bristol to Bradley Letter of September 14 , 1920 . `` I have it from absolute first-hand information that the Armenians in the Caucasus attacked Tartar ( Turkish ) villages that are utterly defenseless and bombarded these villages with artillery and they murder the inhabitants , pillage the village and often burn the village .

Now *this* is a legitimate point . Baseball is entertainment , and I have no quarrel with people who find certain styles of play more entertaining than others , regardless of their win-value . Personally , I 'm a huge fan of the slug-bunt ; I doubt it 's a high-percentage play , but I get a big kick out of it . I am willing to live with the bad consequences in exchange for the fun . Of course , this is *not* the same as claiming ( as some do ) that Galarraga's inability to defer gratification is n't hurting his team because he `` isn't paid to walk '' or `` is an RBI guy '' or whatever . > And finally , I 'd like to point out that many high OBP guys draw > their walks more because pitchers are afraid to throw a strike > to them , than because they have a great `` eye '' I 'm not sure . I used to think this was true , but more and more I 'm becoming convinced that it 's the other way around : among players with the physical ability to hit the ball real hard , the patient ones are the ones who get the chance to do it a lot . Let 's break down the four basic categories of hitter , according to whether they are power threats and whether they walk a lot : Power No Power Patient Frank Thomas Brett Butler Barry Bonds Ozzie Smith Mark McGwire Craig Grebeck Babe Ruth Miller Huggins Ted Williams Billy Hamilton Rickey Henderson Eddie Joost Joe Morgan Mike Hargrove . . . . . . Impatient Ernie Banks Ozzie Guillen Dave Kingman Shawon Dunston Joe Carter Andres Thomas George Bell Jose Lind Kirby Puckett Devon White etc . As far as I can tell , all the categories are full . It really looks like the two are independent . Nobody could possibly be *afraid* of Craig Grebeck at the plate , and yet he walks quite a lot . Part of that , undoubtedly , is being small of stature , but surely major league pitchers can hit that sort of target at least 3 times out of 6 . Randy Milligan is an even better example ; he 's only shown noticeable power for one ( partial ) season , but he walks all over the place , despite his huge strike zone . -- David M.

Something similar has happened to me - ages ago when we were working on PGP we used to send short messages about development issues or simply to test new features around . Now at this time PGP ( and certainly the newer version ) was unknown over here . Suddenly the admin at the site I was using received a request that I stop sending encrypted email . Now there is almost no way that some automatic scanner could have found this , since they would n't have known about PGP - they *must* have checked for unknown data types in the message , tried to unscramble it , found they could n't get past the PEM armour part , and then contacted the sysadmin and asked me to stop . Luckily the current email carriers are less picky about what goes over their networks : - ) . In case people think email scanning does n't take place , I can assure you that it is done regularly by many sites - usually not by government agencies ( or at least not that I know of ) , but by local administrators who , for reasons of their own , have decided to monitor all communications ( I 'm sure you can all think of a whole mess of reasons - stop hackers/ terrorists/child pornographers/drug dealers/evil commies/whatever ) . There have been several occasions when I 've got people into trouble simply by including the traditional NSA bait in a message ( I do n't try it any more now : - ) . A friend of mine was once picked up for mentioning the name of the UK town of Scunthorpe ( hint : look for words embedded in it ) .

The 24 bit image is quantised down to 8 bits so many 'similar ' colours are mapped onto a single palette colour . This colour gets modified in fairly arbitrary ways . You then want to apply these modifications back to the 24 bit file , so you have to find which colours mapped to this one palette colour . Ok you could do this by copying the 24 bit file to a 32 bit file and using the extra 8 bits to hold the index entry . Having done this , you need to do something to them ... what , exactly ? Apply the difference in RGB between the original and modified palette entry to each colour in the group ? This could generate colours with RGB outside the range 0 ... 255 . It would also lead to discontinuities when different parts of a smooth colour gradient mapped to several different palette entries . You could interpolate from full modification to no modification depending how far each colour was from the palette entry . However I suspect this would look rather odd . So in summary , what I said in my previous posting still holds : > > How would you suggest doing colour editing on a 24 bit file ? How > > would you group 'related ' colours to edit them together ?

In other words , to edit a 24 bit file you need software built for the job . Tacking mods onto xv is going to create more problems than it solves . As to the other bits - you seemed to be claiming that there were bugs in XV .

Later , when she ( a young woman of unimpeachible virtue ) was shown to be pregnant ; the soldier did the honorable thing of marrying her . According to this story , they lived happily ever after .

'' | | | + -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -+ DEPOSITION OF KARINE BORISOVNA MELKUMIAN [ 1 ] Born 1963 Teacher Boarding School No . 1 Resident at Building 2B , Apartment 21 Block 41A Sumgait [ Azerbaijan ] This is my fate : I had everything , we were a happy family , and now , at 25 , I 've become a widow , I 'm left to raise my three children alone ; the third , not yet two months old , was born in Yerevan . Igor and I had thought that if it was a girl we would call her Raisa , after my mother-in-law , and if it was a boy , we 'd call him Arsen , after Igor 's grandfather . I had a girl , and I , without Igor , named her Raisa , in honor of her dead grandmother . Our family and the Melkumians had been neighbors since 1965 . Igor and I grew up together , we were friends from childhood on . We got engaged when I was 16 . In 1981 , when I was 18 , we were married . Two children were born to us in Sumgait . My daughter is now 6 years old , her name is Kristina , and my son , Seryozha , is four and a half . First I shall tell what happened on February 27 . That day on my way home from work I passed Lenin Square , where about 1,500 people had gathered . There were Komsomol members there , and Pioneers [ Children 's organization ] , and there were both Party members and non-Party people there as well . All of them were shouting , `` There 's no room for Christians here ! '' and `` When we finish with the Armenians , we 'll go after the Russians ! '' And some even cried Out , `` Death to the Armenians ! '' Absurd rumors had been circulating about town . I became frightened . I came home , breathless , and told about everything I had seen downtown . My family could n't believe it . My father-in-law Sogomon Markovich Melkumian , was n't home , he was at an Azerbaijani wedding . By eight o'clock he returned and had barely finished parking the car when his rear window was smashed with a rock . He got out of the car but there was no one there . Well I was telling him everything , too , and he said , `` What , is there no longer any government ? '' That same day Igor said , `` Papa , something terrible is happening in the city . '' And he said , `` We 'll stay at home , no one will drive us from our own home . '' The day passed . On February 28 , that was Sunday , we did n't go out . We called our relatives and asked them all kinds of questions , and they all said the same thing . Sometime around evening they started smashing the car of an Armenian from the neighboring building . Ira , my brother-in-law 's wife , and I called the police : they 're wrecking a car , help . We called and called , and nonetheless they did n't come and they did n't do anything . On February 29 , on Monday , even though there were troops in the city , we were afraid to go to work . I called the school : I had the keys to the classroom . I told the senior teacher that he should send someone for the keys , I would n't be coming in . He agreed , and even said , `` Fine , do n't come in , we understand what 's going on in town , do n't come in . '' Before that , on the 28th , the Ambartsumian family came over . They came to my father-in-law and said , `` Uncle Sergey , they broke our windows , bad things are happening in town . '' Uncle Misha Ambartsumian even said , `` With my own eyes I saw them chasing naked girls through the streets . I do n't know , '' he said , `` we should leave town . '' Well on the 29th we were already trying to decide where we should go , thinking we 'd go to our dacha . We got a couple of bags together , clothes , food , the bare essentials . And then somewhere around 4:45 the building manager came by and said , `` Uncle Sergey , the situation in town is bad , do n't go out . '' My father even opened up to him and said , `` Maybe we 'll drive to the dacha , it 'll be safer there . '' `` No , '' he said , `` it 'll be worse there , you 'll be safer at home . '' He said do n't be afraid , if something happens I 'll send people to save you . After he left about 15 minutes passed and about 200 people burst into our courtyard . All of us were at home at the time : Igor and I and our two children , Ira and Edik and their daughter , my sister-in-law Ira , and my mother-and father-in-law . And the Ambartsumian family , there were three of them , Uncle Misha , Zhasmen , and their daughter Marina . Now when they started breaking down the door I remember Edik and Igor told us , `` Go in that room and close the door . Close the door and calm the children so they wo n't hear that there 's anyone home . '' The children started crying . Suddenly Ira , my brother-in-law 's wife , suggested , `` Let 's run out onto the balcony . '' We -- the two daughters-in-law and the children , and Zhasmen and Marina -- raced out onto the balcony . My sister-in-law and my mother-in-law ran in and said , '' Quick , over to the other balcony , or they 'll kill you all . '' We lived on the second floor . We needed to cross over from our balcony to our neighbor 's . At first we could n't manage it . The balcony looked onto the street . At that time people were coming home from work , and many just stood there , watching . I pleaded and begged : `` Please , call someone , have someone come ! '' I even started shouting . `` I 'll throw down the children , I 'll throw them down , you catch them and take them somewhere , so at least the children will survive . '' Either they were afraid or . . . I do n't know what . They looked as though they were watching a movie . Some of them started throwing stones at us . I 'll say it again , these were n't the bandits , these were people from the other part of the building and from our entryway , they were just regular people , passersby . A bus even stopped . I remember a man 's voice saying the Armenians were climbing over to the other balcony . Ira , my sister-in-law , helped us get the children over there . I was pregnant , about seven months pregnant . No , it was n't yet seven , it was six and a half . I climbed over too . I think Zhasmen went first ; you know , I just do n't remember it all that well . Zhasmen went first , I think , and Edik 's wife Ira and I had the children , and they were all screaming and crying . My Kristina said , `` Mamma , do n't throw us over the balcony , we 're afraid ! '' Lilia was crying , and Kristina and Seryozha were crying too . Kristina did n't even want to climb over . She shouted , `` I 'm staying with Grandmother , I 'm staying with Grandma ! '' She loved her grandma , more than she loved me . And my mother-in-law shouted , `` Oh no , Kristina 's still there , she 's still there , save Kristina , too ! '' Ira helped us climb over , with Kristina coming last . Ira helped us and went back inside . We started pounding on the neighbor 's balcony door . I pounded with my fist , Sevil , open the door , open it , please ! '' She did n't open it . `` No , go away , go anywhere , go , I 'm not opening the door . '' She was our neighbor , we were friends , we never refused her anything , ever ! And apparently she thought we were going to break the windows , and she opened the door . She opened it and said , `` Karina , Karina , go away , go anywhere , just do n't stay here , they 'll kill us , too , because of you . '' I begged , `` Please , at least take the children , we 'll leave , we 'll go back . '' `` No , '' she said , `` you have to leave . '' Her sons ran in , one had a knife . Sevil 's brother , he 's around 18 , shouted at us : `` Get out of here , leave , I 'll kill you with this knife ! '' I became terrified , I took the children and went out in the entryway and went down a few stairs . I went down and heard a loudspeaker . It was in the courtyard `` The Armenians must be killed , they 've taken all the best places , all the best apartments ! '' One of them said , `` Let the Armenian blood flow , none of them should survive ! '' When I heard that I went upstairs and started knocking on doors . No one opened their door for me ! Not on the third floor , or the fourth . I could n't see Zhasmen any longer . Ira came upstairs later . I even thought that they had let her stay , that they would save her . My head was spinning . They were killing my family , and here I was in the next entryway with two children . Seryozha was four , and Kristina was five and a half . They were crying , `` Mamma , we 're scared ! '' They were so frightened that I did n't even know how to calm them , should I try to calm them or myself ? It was awful . But on the third floor a man did open his door . I asked , `` Open up , let me inside ! '' He opened the door slightly and said , `` No ! '' `` No '' and that was it ! He said it so sternly : `` No ! '' I went up to the fifth floor . I pounded my fists on the door with all my might . He opened up , the man of the house , and stood there , looking at me . I was ready to get down on my knees . I almost did get down on my knees . `` Please , I beg of you , at least take the children . '' He was n't an Azerbaijani , he was a Lezgin . I do n't even know how , but he let me inside . And when I went in , Zhasmen was already there . Two minutes had n't passed when Ira and Lilia came up the stairs . Lilia was crying . He did n't want to open the door . And again I started pleading , `` Please , open the door , it 's our Ira and Lilia ! Open the door ! '' And he said , `` No , I 'm afraid . '' I said again and again , `` Please , open the door , please ! '' He looked at me . He looked at me for a long time and then opened the door after all . Ira came in with Lilia . We threw ourselves into each other 's arms , crying . Then the man locked us into the bathroom . We sat there for a long time . Through the door he told us , `` Calm the children , and calm yourselves down , too . '' Calm down ? This man was hiding us , but what of our family ? When I was still in our apartment I had sensed that none of us would come out of this alive . I said , `` Igor , Edik , let 's say farewell . '' And Edik turned around and looked at me as if to say , is that some kind of joke ? All the same I thought they would kill all of us . Igor looked at me , too . . . But it was already too late ! They started pounding on the door , Igor was standing next to the door . Before that he had told us , `` Go lock yourselves in that room and sit tight . '' He thought we were in the room . But before we went out onto the balcony we went to them : '' Edik , Igor , let 's say farewell . '' Igor did n't think we could climb over to the other balcony . And we did get over there , and I myself ca n't believe we were able to save ourselves . Igor put on a helmet , and Edik had his coat on , and he put on a fur hat . All the men -- Igor , Edik , their father , and Misha Ambartsumian -- they all stood next to the door . They thought they would pound on it a while and leave . But from the other side of the door they ordered in Azerbaijani : `` Open the door ! '' We were all silent , waiting . Someone outside the door said , `` They 're home , they 're in there , break down the door ! '' And I remember my father-in-law whispering , `` They 're going to break it down now , it 's coming down now . . . `` He had something in his hands , I think it was a knife : if they got in , we were going to defend ourselves . In the hall near the door there were two metal chair legs . From outside the door they said , `` We 're counting to five , open up ! '' But we were all quiet , we did n't answer them . We made like no one was home . We figured they 'd leave , they 'd get tired and leave . My father-in-law had said , `` It 's not possible they 'd come into my home . How can that be ? Everyone knows us , all of Sumgait knows our family , we are on good terms with everyone . '' And indeed a day did not pass that there was n't an Azerbaijani guest at our table . We had a nice dacha , everyone would get together there often , Azerbaijanis liked being with us there too . But now we had to save ourselves , we had to flee from our own home . Ira , I remember , said , `` I 'm not leaving here , my brothers and my parents are here , I 'm going to fight alongside them . '' That 's just what she said . She picked up a knife and said , '' If they open the door and come into the apartment then I 'm going to fight alongside my family , I 'm not going anywhere . '' We were at Sevil 's when they broke into our apartment . We heard fighting and shouting . The noise was terrible . And when we hid upstairs on the fifth floor at the Lezgin 's apartment , you could hear everything up there , too . Even Ira 's voice . I remember her calling her mother several times . She called her for a long time . . . I started pounding on the door in the bathroom : `` Open the door , what are they doing to Ira , who 's shouting , that 's Ira shouting , that 's her voice ! '' But the Lezgin said , `` It 's nothing , calm down , no , it 's not in your apartment . '' He was lying to me so I 'd calm down . Two hours went by and the Lezgin opened the door and said , `` Karina , Igor got away , calm down . He ran away . '' He saw Igor break away and run off with his own eyes . They killed him outside , next to the building . While we were in the bathroom I experienced every possible human terror . The way Ira shouted ! She shouted , `` Save me , Mamma , save me ! . . . Mamma , Mamma ! '' She repeated it several times . There was a wild din . There were very many people there , all of them shouting , all of them bellowing , howling , whistling -- you just ca n't imagine what was going on , what the roar was like . Apparently , after they had killed Ira those murderers came into the entryway where we were hiding and came upstairs , all the way up to the fifth floor . I do n't know if they were just looking for any Armenians or for us in particular , but I think they were looking for us because when we had climbed over the balconies someone on the street was saying that the daughters-in-law were climbing over the balconies . And after we heard Ira we heard them coming up the stairs in the entryway and hammering on the doors . I thought those were our last moments , and started saying good-bye to my children , kissing them . They were sleeping . I woke them up : `` Kristina ! Seryozha , wake up ! '' And I tell Ira : `` Ira , if something happens , we 'll throw ourselves off the balcony . '' We were on the fifth floor . Apparently our Lezgin neighbor had opened the door too , because later he said , `` I opened the door and told them there were no Armenians inside . '' And after they all left our neighbor went out on the balcony himself to see : they were gone . We were n't friends with those Lezgin neighbors , we only knew each other from the building . But the people we were friends with would n't even consider hiding us . The Lezgin let us out of the bathroom . They had a candle burning . He said , '' Karina , there 're no lights on in our block . '' The whole block was dark , the whole block ! It 's a huge block , too . The Lezgin said , `` I 'm afraid to keep you until morning , I 'm afraid of the neighbors , they might kill me for saving you . '' I said , `` What are you saying , we 'll leave now . But we ca n't just leave with the children in the middle of the night . Give us time to find somewhere else to hide . '' He said , `` Well OK , go look . '' I asked Ira , `` Ira , do you want to go ? '' Ira said , `` No , I 'll stay with the children , Karina . '' I said , `` Fine , then I 'll go . '' Zhasmen and I went downstairs together . It was very dark . No one was in the courtyard . It was dark , pitch black . l was afraid to go out at after seven , Igor always met me after work and accompanied me home , I never went out alone . And now here I was out in the middle of the night and after a slaughter like that , too . It was probably after eleven . Later I called the boarding school and my director answered . He said , `` Karina , where are you ? '' I did n't know , I was calling from a public phone outside and did n't know where I was . I got confused and hung up the receiver . From him I only found out what time it was , I asked him , `` What time is it ? '' He said 11:20 , I think , but I do n't really remember . So anyway Zhasmen and I went out into the courtyard . I look and see what appears to be a person not far from our apartment . And there was the smell of something burnt . I became horrified . I looked at the corpse for a long time . It was either Ira or Edik . I only saw one of them , Zhasmen grabbed my hand and squeezed it : `` Hurry up , let 's go . . . Hurry up , come on , what are you turning around for ? '' I turned around and saw a large truck , it must have belonged to the bandits , because they came to kill us in a truck like that . We lived in the third entryway , and that truck was next to the fourth . We walked quickly , holding hands . I thought , if I go to the police then they 'll put me away . I could n't count on them . Before I reached the police station I saw a military vehicle . We went over and I said , `` Soldier , in Block 41 , I do n't know if they 've killed people or injured them -- we need to save them ! '' And he said , `` Go to the police station and tell them everything . '' I said , `` I 'm afraid to go there , I 'm afraid of them . '' He said , `` Do n't be afraid . '' We went to the police and they wrote down the address , and the military vehicle went to our building . I did n't go with them , they left me at the police station . I gave the addresses of my mother and my brothers so that they 'd rescue them , too . I did n't know where they were or what had happened to them . After a while they brought my children and Ira and Lilia . First they took us to the KGB , that was at two or three in the morning . Then around five they took us to the City Party Committee , and there were very many people there , very many . I was pregnant and was wearing nothing but a dress . Seryozha was only wearing a shirt , and Kristina had a little dress on . No coat , no boots , nothing ! And we sat there for three whole days in the City Party Committee . The Lezgin had told me that Igor escaped . And I thought that he was probably alive . But then after two and a half days , they took us , the Armenians of Sumgait , to Nasosny . On March 6 some people from the Central Committee came and told us , `` Karina , Ira , we need you , come with us to the City Party Committee . '' My Mamma had come to Nasosny , and she had been looking for me for six days . Mama , my brothers , and my uncle . We went to the City Party Committee and waited there in the courtyard . I was wearing nothing but a dress , and Ira had only a dress on as well . There was a strong wind on March 6 . An hour went by . And then one of the functionaries told us , `` Karina , Ira , gather your courage . Would you like to go to the burial ? '' I said , `` What , did they really kill all of them ? ! '' He said , `` Let 's look . '' He had a long list , and he started reading them off : Igor Melkumian , my husband , Eduard Melkumian , my brother-in- law , Irina Melkumian , my sister-in-law , Sogomon Melkumian , my father-in-law , and Raisa Melkumian , my mother-in-law . He read off all their names and said , '' Get in the car , let 's go to the burial . '' We buried our family . I could n't believe it at the time , I could n't conceive of it or imagine it . . . And even now I think how shall I explain it to my children when they 're older ? My children were very attached to their father and their grandfather and grandmother . Kristina did n't love me the way she loved her grandfather and grandmother , they spoiled her . Kristina would always announce , `` My grandma is better than anyone ! '' Now , even though she is getting used to my mother , it 's difficult for her , and once she told her : `` You 're a bad grandmother . '' I do n't know why , I asked her , `` Kristina , where 's Papa ? '' and she said , `` They killed him . '' She knows , she understands it all . And recently I scolded Seryozha severely for something , and he started shouting at me , `` When Papa comes I 'm going to tell him everything !

From : sam @ steamer.clam.com ( Sam Mandelbaum ) Subject : Yankee Thoughts Organization : CLaM Associates , Cambridge , MA 02141 Lines : 76 Yes - Everyone seems to be in agreement that the Yankees are finally moving in the right direction . They should finish over .500 this year and maybe even be in the pennent race in August . However , I would take back a few moves : 1 . The Jim Abbott Trade . I think Abbott is not only an inspirational person , but a great pitcher also . He could win the Cy Young this year , but he wo n't because the right side of the Yanks infield is n't good enough . So why was this not a good trade ? JT Snow . How many rookies have been able to step in and immediately have the impact that he has had so far on the Angels ? I know it 's early , but if you 've seen this kid hit , field or talk you can just tell that he is going to be a tremendous player . The Yanks should have kept him . What about Mattingly , you ask ? Well - it 's great that the Yanks have taken care of him and remained loyal , but he 's 10 years older than Snow and just does n't have the same bat speed as before his back injury . It 's a shame , but as a Yankee fan who wants to see the *best* Yankee team , I 'd take Snow over Mattingly at first . The Yanks also gave up two promising propects with Snow for Abbott . Besides , with Domingo Jean , Brien taylor , Wickman , Militello , and Sterling Hitchcock , they are just loaded with propects . I know Abbotts only 26 , but this was too much to give up . I believe George forced this trade because he believes ( and he 's right ) that Abbott will be a big hit in NY . However , I 'd like to see the Yankees build a baseball team , not an amusement show . 2 . Wade Boggs . I live in Boston and like Wade a lot . But , his career is winding down and I would rather see the Yanks start to develop a long term solution ( i.e . Hensley Muelins , Russ Davis , Velarde ? ) . Besides , Wade just does n't have any range . What a shame about Charlie Hayes , huh ? 3 . Spike Owen . See Wade Boggs . I 'd much rather see them develop Dave Silvestri or whoever . Wade and Spike next to each other in the infield is going to raise the Yankee staff ERA 1/2 point . And these guys are on the down sides of their careers . 4 . Danny Tartabull . Yes - he 's put up some tremendous numbers and it 's nice to think about what he could do if he were ever healthy all year . But he never is . We should expect 120 games max out of him . Meanwhile , Gerald Williams is playing at Columbus and Paul O'Neil is playing left field ! I believe O'Neil led NL outfielders in assists last year - and Tartabull is a poor defensive outfielder . What I 'm basically getting at is the Yanks are moving in the right direction but are NOT ready to win a pennent this year . They should ( at the GM level ) be planning for a 1994 or 1995 world series . This means getting the younger players experience in the majors NOW so they will be ready in a year or two . I 'm afraid that all this stuff wreaks of George Steinbrenner . Certainly , the Boggs deal was all George . It looks like George is planning the right mix of veterans and young players to win a world series now . The veterans are always available and can be added at any time ( like Boston did this year ) . Develop the young players first , then add the one or two veterans ( or in the Yankees case , just keep them ) . Let 's all us Yankee fans hope that George does n't dismantle the terrific job Stick and company have done building the Yankee organization back into one of respect . I 'm really afraid that he will trade whoever it takes to patch holes today ( relief pitching for example ) . George must realize that the Yankees rebuilding process is still one or two years away . Have patience George and we will all enjoy the future . Fire Bucky and trade the kids and it 's baseball hell for all loyal Yankee fans for a long time !

From _Free Inquiry_ , Winter 83/84 , the following is an introduction to the article `` Joseph Smith and the Book of Mormon '' , by George D. Smith . The introduction is written by Paul Kurtz . Mormonism -- the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints -- claims a worldwide membership 5.2 million . It is one of the world 's fastest growing religions , with as many as 200,000 new converst in 1982 alone . Because of the church's aggressive missionary program , covering more than one hundred countries , it is spreading even to third world countries . Mormonism is both puritanical in moral outlook and evangelical in preachment . The church is run along strict authoritarian lines . Led by a president , who allegedly receives revelations directly form God , and a group of twelve apostles who attempt to maintain orthodoxy in belief and practice , the church is opposed to abortion , pornography , sexual freedom , women 's rights , and other , in its view , immoral influences of secular society , and it forbids the use of tobacco , alcohol , coffee , and tea . Centered in Salt Lake City , the church is extremely wealthy and politically powerful in Utal and many other western states . Among well-know present-day Mormons are Ezra Taft Benson ( former secretary of agriculture ) , the Osmond family , the Mariotts of the hotel empire , and a score of high-placed government officials . The Mormon church was founded in western New York in 1830 by Joseph Smith who claimed that by divine revelation be had found gold plates containing hieroglyphics buried on a hill and that with the help of visits from the angel Moroni he had been able to translate the writing into the _Book of Mormon_ , the basis of Mormon belief . This book , written `` by the commandment of God , '' claims that the ancient Hebrews settled in America about 600 B.C.E . and were the ancestors of the American Indians . Mormons believe that those who have been baptized in the `` true church '' will be reunited after death and that deceased non-Mormon family members can be baptized by proxy and thus join their relatives in the hereafter . Because of these beliefs , Mormons have been considered outcasts by mainline Christian denominations and as heretics by religious fundamentalists . Joseph Smith was a controversial figure in his day -- he was both worshiped as a saint and denounced as a fraud . Because of persecution he led his band of loyal followers from Palmyra , New York , westward to Ohio and then to Illinois , where in 1844 he was shot to death by an agry mob . Brigham Young , who reportedly had as many as eighty wives , took over the leadership of the church and led the Mormons further westward , to found the new Zion in Salt Lake City . Following the teachings of Joseph Smith in the practice of polygamy was perhaps the Mormons most controversial practice in nineteenth-century America . While other religions go back many centuries -- Muhammadanism , 1200 years ; Christianity , 2000 ; and Judaism , 3000 -- and attempts to examine their beginnings are difficult , extensive historical investigation of Mormon roots is possible . Some Mormons are willing to examine this history objectively , bu others maintain that such scrutiny is dangerous to the faith . In the following pages , _Free Inquiry_ presents two articles about the Mormon church . First , George D. Smith , a lifelong member of the church , provides a detailed critical examination of Joseph Smith and his claim the the _Book of Mormon_ was divinely revealed . Second , we present a portion of an interview with philosopher Sterling McMurrin , also a Mormon since birth , who questions the treatment of the history of the church by Mormon authorities . -- Paul Kurtz The article itself is super . , ... , . , , /666 ; ' , //// ; _~ - ( / @ / -- -- 0-~-0 ; ' . `` ~ \' , ` ' , > ; ; |\..

I 've been reading this board passively for a while now and find the subject absolutely fascinating , especially from the point of view of a civil rights nut like myself . My problem is that I 'm new to the field and paragraphs like the above keep popping up . I 'm sure what Mr. Bellovin is writing about is both fascinating and important , but I have NO IDEA what it means . : - ) Anyway I 'm keen to learn and will read anything I can get my hands on that explains this stuff in lay terms ( I have a decent CS background , but not a huge amount of hyper-advanced math ) . Can anyone point me to a FAQ or a decent source of information about the guts of current cryptography and maybe a little history as well ? I read the piece in this month 's WIRED , can anyone tell me how much I should trust the references they suggest ?

I was also at the Saturday game in Montreal ( Apr 17 ) that Rockies won 9-1 . I haven't paid much attention to Gallarraga since he left the Expos but his stance seemed to be MUCH different . He stands more erect and very open , with his left foot pointing to 3rd base . I 'm wondering if this is a recent change in stance for him ? Andres had one glaring weakness as a hitter . He could always be fooled by a curve ball low and away . If this is indeed a new stance for him , maybe he is not being fooled as easily ? As for his patience , Dennis Martinez definitely did not have his good stuff . If he was grooving pitches to Andres , you can hardly fault him for drilling them ( which he did ! ) . Does Andres generally start hot or cold ? Does it take until May for most pitchers to have confidence in that curve ball low and away ? Roger Healey

From : JEK @ cu.nih.gov Subject : legal definition of religion Lines : 31 Edgar Pearlstein asks ( Fri 7 May 1993 ) whether the Supreme Court , or any other government authority , has attempted a legal definition of religion . The Universal Military Training and Service Act of 1958 exempted from the draft those whose `` religious training and belief '' was opposed to participation in war in any form . It defined `` R T & B '' as '' an individual 's belief in a relation to a Supreme Being involving duties superior to those arising from any human relation , but [ not including ] essentially political , sociological , or philosophical views or a merely personal moral code . '' In the 1965 case of UNITED STATES V. SEEGER , the Supreme Court broadened the definition so as not to restrict it to explicit theists . Justice Tom Clark , delivering the Court 's opinion , said : We have concluded that Congress , in using the expression `` Supreme Being '' rather than the designation `` God , '' ... . the test of belief `` in a relation to a Superme Being '' is whether a given belief that is sincere and meaningful occupies a place in the life of its possessor parallel to that filled by the orthodox belief in God of one who clearly qualifies for the exemption . Where such beliefs have parallel positions in the lives of their respective holders we can not say that one is `` in a relation to a Supreme Being '' and the other is not ... .

There is one point I 'd like to make , that most people seem to have forgotten . That is that one of the underlining principles in the Constitution is a DISTRUST of governmental authority and control . All those `` checks & balances '' is because they realize that you should distrust those in power . What everyone seems to have forgotten as well is the original reason that the Bill of Rights guaranteed the right to bear arms . It 's inclusion was not to allow you to protect yourself against other citizens , but to prevent the government from taking away your only means of protecting yourself from an armed and aggressive government . Its hard to oppress your citizenry when its armed against you . I am not a fanatic , I 'm a retired Naval officer . Because I have spent so much time defending it , perhaps I understand its `` purpose '' as well as its `` plan '' . Lance Kimes

But to add to this explaniation , each individual detector also has a built in fail-safe , just so the detector does not read the background radiation ( i.e . cosmic rays ) , if I remember right , the detectors go off about 3 to 5 sigma above the background . This is so they do n't catch particularly energetic cosmic rays that would normally set it off . Even with this buffer , they still have to throw out something like 1/2 of the bursts that they DO get , because of the Earth's Van Allen Belts , the South Atlantic Anomaly , the Sun , if I remember right , there is either a radar station , or a radio station in Australia , and there are a couple other sources as well . -jeremy belgarath @ vax1.mankato.msus.edu

Hope he/she doesnt mind . By Lance Gay , Scripps-Howard News Service SARAJEVO , Bosnia-Herzegovina -- In this land of historic hatreds , a tiny Jewish community is braving Serbian shells to repay a 50-year-old debt to Muslims who saved Jews from the Holocaust . Ivica Ceresnjes , president of the Jewish Community of Sarajevo , says he and about 1,000 other Jews chose to remain in Sarajevo , rather than leave for Israel , to keep a feeding center in the medieval old town district running . Ceresnjes said that was partly in gratitude to the Muslims who hid Jews during the Nazi occupation and partly to keep intact the centuries-old presence of Jews living in Sarajevo . `` Some with guns are defending Bosnia , but I fight in Bosnia by keeping people alive , '' Ceresnjes said . As a student of Balkan history , Ceresnjes said he saw this war coming and had ready plans to evacuate children and the elderly . A year before the war erupted here last April , Ceresnjes said the Jewish center began stockpiling supplies , ensuring everyone had passports and arranging for places in Israel and Europe for the evacuees . They were so well prepared , he said , that only five days after the shooting began the first plane left . Of about 2,000 Jews in Bosnia- Herzegovina , he estimates half have left . Many of those who stayed behind work in Sarajevo 's downtown synagogue , which has been turned into a wartime feeding center that has so far given away 380,000 meals . The center , which has been shelled several times along with most of Sarajevo , also runs a radio station , mail center and distributes food packages sent by Jewish organizations around the world . While Muslims and Jews are fighting each other in the Mideast , Jews here say there 's a long tradition of cooperation , inter-marriage and tolerance between the two communities in Sarajevo that goes back to centuries of Turkish occupation . Sarajevo 's Jews trace their ancestry back to their expulsion from Roman Catholic Spain in 1492 . The community numbered more than 14,000 before World War II . But only 10 % survived the Holocaust -- which was carried out by the pro-Nazi Croatian Ustache in Yugoslavia . Many of the survivors were hidden by Muslim families in Mostar . -- Sharon Machlis Gartenberg Framingham , MA USA e-mail : sharon @ world.std.com -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Zafar . tippu hassan

From : truesdal @ david.wheaton.edu ( Phil Truesdale ) Subject : MGB questions Summary : Need pre-purchase help Organization : Wheaton College , IL Distribution : na Lines : 35 My son is considering the purchase of a 71 MGB , which has been substantially restored . The odometer has rolled over , but we ca n't be sure of the actual mileage . The engine and drive train apparently were n't touched in the restoration , except for a new carb and a few hoses . He plans to do vacuum and compression checks to see what they might tell us about the engine . The body and undercarriage have no visible rust , the interior is new , as are tires , front brakes ( not sure about the back ) , battery , bumpers and other misc parts . The paint is checked in a few places , and scuffed here and there , allegedly by a wind-blown car cover . It seemed to handle OK , except for soft front shocks . Questions : Are there problem areas common to MGBs we should check out ? The brakes seem soft and rather ineffective ; what should we expect in the way of braking action ? It seemed to be `` doggy '' when accelerating from a stop . What should we expect it to do , given the 4-cylinder engine ? The top is in place , but will not reach a number of the snaps . The weather was cold . Should the vinyl stretch and fit when it warms up , or is it forever shrunk ? Is it normal for the wire wheels to be painted , or are they usually chromed ? Given this rather limited description , what would be a reasonable price ? Gee , this turned out to be a little long -- sorry . While my brother once owned an XK120 Jag ( what a car ! ) we 're obviously not into sports cars . Any help with these questions , or suggestions on other things to investigate would surely be appreciated . Phil Truesdale truesdal @ david.wheaton.edu

Even you don't > go that far . Sorry , but I 'd have to differ . The Canadian-bashing wrt to the health insurance system is largely with little evidence or prompting . Having kept up with this debate on the net for some months , just about all the criticism of the Canadian system has misquoted or misinterpreted even the anti-Canadian propaganda put out by the American insurance industry and the AMA . In a few cases , such as Mr. Case , the critiques are well-reasoned and worthy of response . Most others are misinformed , illogical , or just plain dumb . I do n't think the same can be said of the `` American proponents '' of the Canadian system , much less of the Canadian proponents . jsh -- Steve Hendricks | DOMAIN : steveh @ thor.ISC-BR.COM '' One thing about data , it sure does cut| UUCP : ... ! uunet ! isc-br ! thor ! steveh the bulls**t.

Originator : kruckenb @ peruvian.cs.utah.edu Organization : University of Utah CS Dept Lines : 53 FOR SALE : AT & T Dataport Internal 14.4K Fax/Modem The modem is an internal AT/ ( E ) ISA 8-bit card ( just a little longer than a half-card ) . It has v.32bis for 14.4Kbps data / 9600 bps fax , v.42 , v.42bis , and MNP5 for error-correction and data compression , so you can get error-free links up to 57,600 bps on a conventional phone line . They will `` fall back '' to any speed ( down to 1200bps ) and even disable compression and error-correction if necessary in order to connect with slower and older modems . It has a 16550 buffered UART for better compatibility with multi-tasking operating systems ( Windows , OS/2 , Unix , etc ) . They use a patented technology called Optical Line Interface ( OLI ) which reduces noise generated by the modem to assure the fastest and cleanest connection possible . These modems come with a lifetime warranty and free lifetime tech support ( and the call is free , too ) from AT & T . They also include the lovely and talented QuickLink II for DOS and the NEW QuickLink II for Windows communications and fax software which will let you conveniently sent faxes from any DOS or Windows application just by printing . The Windows version will send faxes of any font and can include graphics , etc . The DOS version can fax graphics and a limited set of fonts ( I believe that there are 5 or so , as well as any HP Laser II resident fonts ) . I 'm asking $ 210.00 for this modem ( plus Utah tax ) . This is at or below the prices of any other ( reputable ) manufacturer of an equivalent modem ( including Zoom , US Robotics , etc ) . And , it is backed by a company that will never go away . This price will include delivery if you live within 20 miles of downtown SLC . I can also arrange shipping , or you can stop by my home to pick it up . ( If you 're concerned about installing an internal modem , let me know and we can discuss an arrangement for including installation . ) If you 're interested , please let me know . This is an excellent modem at an excellent price ( they normally list for ~ $ 500 and retail for about ~ $ 300 ) . I installed one of these last week and it is very nice . If you have questions about this , AT & T has an info number at ( 800 ) 554-4996 , or you can email me and I will attemp to answer them . The modem will go to the highest bidder I get within the next week . Thanks . Pete

I bought a new 486 machine not long ago after being disconnected from the pc world for a while ( I have been running on an xt 5MHz till last january ! ! ) . The machine I bought came equipped with a ATI VGA XL 24 graphic card . It gives a very nice picture and the Windows drivers are pretty stable . The only problem is that it is quite slow . I would like to go for a faster card ( not in the 400 $ range ) . I saw a lot of comments on many products over the last weeks , but did n't get an overall picture clear enough to make a choice . My question is : Could somebody direct me to a source of information which would help me in my quest . I would like to get information about : - the refresh rates the various cards provide ; - quality of windows drivers ; - standard vga performance ( non-Windows stuff ) . Direct me to a magazine article or something like that ( I got winvid.zip info , but it is not enough ) . If you have an ISA card you are really satisfied with it , let me know . If this information is of any use , here is my system configuration : - Fujikama 486 33MHz ISA system ( Contaq motherboard ) - monitor DARIUS 14 '' non-interlaced multisync ( up to 1024X768 ) ( can reach 70kHz horizontally ) I would also like to know if it is a standard for video drivers to allow screen dimensioning and screen positioning by writing on the EPROM of the graphic card . This is the case with my ATI card and it is very convenient when changing graphics mode since my monitor is not intelligent enough to record settings .

Controversy for the sake of truth is a divine command . '' -Dr. Walter Martin Dr. Walter Martin personally selected Hank Hanegraaff to succeed him as President of the Christian Research Institute -- the largest evangelical counter-cult organization in the world . In this skillful , careful treatment of an explosive subject , Hanegraaff documents and examines how the beliefs of the Word of Faith movement clearly compromises and confuse the essentials of the historic Christian faith . For the first time ever , this large and influential movement is legitimately labeled as cultic . In this book , Hanegraaff discusses such leaders of the Word of Faith movement as E.W . Kenyon and the Twelve Apostles of `` another gospel '' ( Gal 1:6-9 ) ( Kenneth E. Hagin , Kenneth Copeland , Benny Hinn , Frederick K.C . Price , John Avanzini , Robert Tilton , Marilyn Hickey , Paul ( David ) Yonggi Cho , Charles Capps , Jerry Savelle , Morris Cerullo , and Paul and Jan Crouch ) . The book is now available through Harvest House Publishers and should be in most Christian Book Stores soon . You can order a hard-back copy through CRI for $ 14.99 by calling 1-800-443-9797 and avoid retail mark-ups . The Christian Research Journal , which is a quarterly publication by CRI has an article in it 's most recent issue just released called , `` What 's Wrong With The Word Faith Movement ? '' This is a good article that will inform you of each of the teachers above , and tide you over until your book arrives .

Read > Bamford 's THE PUZZLE PALACE . I did . You 're mistaken . NSA 's communications intelligence mission is strictly against foreign governments . Here 's an excerpt from the enabling charter ( 24 Oct 52 , Truman ) that should clarify this . The charter was declassified in about Feb 1990 when an FOIA request made it public . Mind you , I do n't know that they never collect anything they 're not supposed to ... but spying on US citizens is n't in their charter . b . The COMINT mission of the National Security Agency ( NSA ) shall be to provide an effective , unified organization and control of the communications intelligence activities of the United States conducted against foreign governments , to provide for integrated operational policies and procedures pertaining thereto . As used in this directive , the terms '' communications intelligence '' or `` COMINT '' shall be construed to mean all procedures and methods used in the interception of communications other than foreign press and propaganda broadcasts and the obtaining of information from such communications by other than intended recipients , but shall exclude censorship and the production and dissemination of finished intelligence . They 're also tasked with protecting the US 's communications , but I haven't seen the specific enabling memo on that . I assume that 's the role under which Skipjack was developed . NSA is not in the standard-setting business , though -- that 's why this Clipper stuff came from NIST , which I believe is tasked with coming up with standards based on their best inputs from other government agencies , which would include NSA . -- Jim Gillogly Mersday , 4 Thrimidge S.R . 1993 , 21:59

This just really blew my socks off . Read I Tim 1 : 3-11 . Verses 3-8 speaks against those who have perverted the teachings of the Mosaic Law . In vv.9-10 , we have , *IN ORDER* , the 5th thru the 9th commandments and in the midst of this listing is `` homosexuals . '' The decalogue , above everything else , is seen as God 's absolute . If you do n't believe in absolutes , then you have nothing do do with Jehovah of the OT , which Paul reveals to be the Messiah of the NT . `` Lord Christ Jesus '' transliterates to read '' Jehovah 's Anointed Savior . '' In I Cor5 , we see the same emphasis of moral separation from the pagan gentiles as we do in Lev 18-20 . In I Cor 6:9-10 , only one notation ( drunkards ) is not found in Lev 18-20 . Paul was not naive in his use of the LXX . He knew full well how he was using the Law of God that was given in the OT , for application in the NT .

This understanding is thoroughly rebutted in DeYoungs article that is being posted . Please refer to it . > > One of the reasons that some of us do not accept that common argument > is because Paul probably did face this and other problems . We can do better than `` probably '' which is not an adequate defense against the statement that Paul 's culture did n't have the same understanding of homosexuality as ours . Again read the article because it uses facts . > > I claim that the question of how to counsel homosexual Christians is > > not entirely a theological issue , but also a pastoral one . > > I do n't see how you come to that conclusion . I think I do , because I have worked in the homosexual community by means of working with AIDs patients . The pastoral is merely the practical application of the theological truth however . Those who are working thru the issue of homosexuality need to have our love and understanding just as with a friend who is contiplating cheating on his wife or a friend who lives with his girlfriend , yet you continue to witness to him . But , once the choice is made , and there is no remorse , then I feel that Paul 's `` pastoral '' care , as presented in the Corinthian Church , come to bear significance . THe one in active rebellion should be placed outside of the church if a believer , and if a non-believer , then one wipes his sandels and leaves it in Gods hand . If there was a member in your youth group who was constantly pawing at the little girls , you wouldn't hesitate to deal with the matter quickly and decisivly . That , in part , betrays the present `` political correctness '' of the issue . Pederasty is not accepted at the present , but some how we are to accept homosexuality because the latter is politically correct , while the former is not -at least not yet . THis is how the morals decay . I guess this would follow the liberal application in the political realm of economics . The liberals want to tax the rich in the federal , yet in their own states , when they try to get businesses to settle there , they give tax incentives to these same richies . It comes down to a moral code of relativeness , or to use the cultural thing , politically correct -at the moment . -- Rex [ You might want to look over 1 Tim 1:10 again . If this is really the 5th through 9th commandments , we seem to be missing thieves , and homosexuals would have to be fit in under adultery . This is of course possible if `` arsenokoitia '' has a narrower meaning than homosexuality in general , but I think that 's not your thesis . I have no objection per se to the idea that the author of 1 Tim might have quoted the 10 commandments , but 5 through 9 , minus one and plus a few things , begins to look a bit marginal . -- clh ]

I 'd be interested in knowing what our geology/environmental sciences friends think . As for human tolerances , the best example of human endurance in terms of altitude ( i.e . low atmospheric pressure and lower oxygen partial pressure ) is in my opinion to the scaling of Mt . Everest without oxygen assistance . This was accomplished by a team of mountaineers who trained at high altitudes for quite awhile ( I think a few months ) and then were flown by helicopter from that training altitude to the equivalent altitude on Mount Everest , where they began the ascent of our planet 's highest peak without oxygen tanks . This is quite a feat of physiological endurance , because if you or I tried to go to 20,000 feet and exert ourselves , we would probably pass out , get altitude sick , and could even die from cerebral edema . So this is the limit of low pressure . High pressure situations would be limited by the duration of time which it takes to slowly acclimate to a higher pressure . Skin divers would know alot about high pressure situations and could tell you about how they safely make deep dives without getting the bends . Some military experiments have put people under several atmospheres of pressure ( not sure what the high limit was because the papers are n't in front of me ) . Usually at a certain point , the nitrogen in the air becomes toxic to the body and you start acting idiotic . Divers call this nitrogen narcosis . Those afflicted can do very dangerous and irrational things , like taking off a diving mask and oxygen tank in order to talk to fish at 100 feet under water . ( Hope any diving folk can elaborate on this matter , as I am not a diving expert ) . Mars can not support human life without pressurization because the atmosphere is too thin ( 1/100 th our Earth 's atmospheric density ) . In addition , the Mars atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide . Basically , you would need a pressure suit there , or you 'd die from the low pressure . Interesting huh ? ken khayash @ hsc.usc.edu

It 's similar to collecting coins , or stamps , or campaign buttons , or coke bottles , or juke boxes , or model trains , or just about anything else that is collected ( and just about everything is collected ) . In all cases , you might consider it something of an aberration ; I mean , what purpose does it serve ? Not much really ; it 's just a hobby . The collector yearns for diversity ( not much use in having TWO of the same thing , except for trading/selling it ) , historical significance ( this was the thingy used by so-and-so ) , technical significance ( this is the only one that does such-and-such like this ; this is the first one to do it this way ) , rarity , and so on . Some people use their collections , other people do not . As you state , you use your collection . In one sense , this diminishes the value of your collection as the items suffer wear and exposure . In another sense , it can enhance your own enjoyment of your collection . Some people collect firearms that they do not use ; other people use some or all of the firearms they collect . It 's just personal preference . Oops , 'personal preference ' ... I guess we 're not supposed to have that any more , are we ? J.Baker .

Organization : Cold Spring Harbor Lab Lines : 24 NNTP-Posting-Host : phage.cshl.org I think a few things are being missed overall here ... First of all , anyone with a DOS manual can copy a disk , or copy anything ( hidden files dont go far if you are dealing with anyone who is not comletely DOS ignorant ) off of a hard disk . 'Professional ' crackers aren ; t interested in copying disks . They are programmers who get some thrill out of going through unassembly listings of programs to disable copy protection such as serial number dialog boxes , volume label checks , and who knows what when it comes to computer games . Those people are in the minority , however . In my experience with the world of people and software , it seems that a good majority of people ( say 80 % ) will at some point copy a friend 's program ( `` Gee , you really oughta try this '' ) or accept a copy . These are people who normally would buy a software package or do without , but decided that just once it would n't matter . The last thing is people who own or are responsible for more than one computer ; most people are n't going to spend $ 150 * X # of computers for the same software package.. they will just install it x # of times , especially things like DOS upgrades . -- | -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -| | Are we having fun yet ? | | -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -|

I 'd hate to be one who actually does innovate , and then have Microsoft come in like a huge vulture and use their brute mass ( development staff , marketing , etc ) to get fat off of my innovation . I do n't have all that much sympathy for Apple 's complaint against Microsoft , since they just took the ideas from Xerox 's PA Research Center when the Federal government forced Xerox to disclose their patents over antitrust fears . However , for other companies and individuals who have a great idea , yet get it `` borrowed '' by larger corporations who can afford to quickly bring it to market , without any licensing from the original innovator , I feel much sympathy .

It is entirely possible that they will soon invade . Unluckily for Yemen it is not popular in the West as they managed to put aside political differences during reunification and thus the West has effectively lost one half ( North ? ) as a client state .

Try coming up with your own definition of any or all `` self-hating '' peoples . To me , any who reject their culture to the point where they *only* see the absolute negatives of that culture ( generally , or regarding a particular event ) and accept *only* those views purely opposing aspects of that culture ( thus , selective belief in and use of historical facts and a complete ignoring of `` context '' results ) `` hate '' their culture .

They cost ~ $ 1 at Radio Shack ( much cheaper in quantity at quality places ) , and you will be able to find good info about simple circuits in a 555 oscialltor notebook ( I think Forest Mims has one at Radio Shack ) . You 'll have to toy with resistor/capacitor values OR you can use your head with a little math to get the right frequencies . Any engineer worth his salt , can make a 555 osciallator ... It 's in the book , and left up to you to see ( I hate doing ASCII circuit graphics ) . The 555 can accurately go from a few Hz to about 500 KHz ( I think ) . About the Tape Recorder gizmo , you could alter a stereo tape deck to use one channel as a DATA line ( for flashing LED ) , and one as audio line ( for voice or music ) . This would eliminate a lot of noise . The data line is probably most easily done by some kind of PLL or bandpass filter ( using just an op-amp ) . The 565 chip is a good PLL , and not hard to work with . However if you nothing about how a PLL works , I suggest you do n't try this . Op-Amp information can also be found in the Forest Mims Radio Shack info-booklets , and the popular 741 op-amp is a snap to work with . Setting frequency and bandpass filter values are not so easy , so I would suggest the 555 method firstmost ... I have no idea what this is going into , so I am really generalizing ... As for manufacturing techniques , if you 're only goofing with it , I suggest you breadboard the thing ... No need to solder . Wire-wrap would be the next , more permanent step .

If we are indeed talking about CS , then this is not quite accurate . CS is '' just '' tear gas -- albeit the worst kind . It is n't a nausea gas , and doesn't have direct CNS effects . However , it 's quite bad -- much worse than CN gas . I was briefly exposed to it once ( during an engagement in Berkeley circa 1968 8^ ) and it 's not the kind of thing you forget . It seems to be moisture-activated -- it not only made my eyes sting and water , but attacked my breathing passages and lungs . Breathing was painful , and my entire face felt as if it was on fire . These effects persisted for hours after exposure , and I was coughing for days afterwards . If I was exposed to a dense concentration of this stuff in a closed space for several hours , I doubt whether I could find the exit .

I am astounded at the number of times people post strong opinions about things they not only do n't understand but publicly admit to not understanding . In fact , there 's a plausible argument that saves are a more rational stat than wins . For the record , there are two ways that a reliever can get a save : He must finish the game and either 1. have entered the game with the tying run on base , at bat , or on deck . 2. have pitched at least three innings effectively . A pitcher may not get a win and a save in the same game . > I believe that the official scorers must assert more of their authority in > determining winners/savers/etc .

I have a 386 PC with lots of disk space and memory , a Postscript laser , Win3.1 , Finale 2.0.1 and I recently installed ATM 2.0 . I 've been fiddling around with the Windows setup for some time , and when I needed to do some work with Finale things did n't print properly . It might - and it might not - have anything to do with the installation of ATM from 1.something to 2.0 , but I do n't have the old ATM lying around anomore . The most annoying problem was that the Petrucci font did n't print , which is a rather important font : - ) I managed to get direct printing to work if I included OwnPS=0 in the [ Finale ] section of WIN.INI , but Compile PostScript Listing still does n't work ; and it 's those .EPS files I need . When I look at the .eps files generated the only font which appears there is Courier . I found out that if I manually changed the Courier 24-point to Petrucci 24-point in the .EPS file everything worked ok , but I 'd rather avoid that since I have a lot of songs to work with . And yes , in the Special/Font/Font names dialog box all the fonts I need are listed , with the correct mapping between Finale , Screen and Printer fonts . Finale is obviously aware of the fonts since direct printing of a score works well ( that is , after I included OwnPS=0 ) , and all my other Windows applications print Petrucci and the other fonts well . Has anyone encountered problems like this ? What is the current version of Finale from Coda Music Software ? I have 2.0.1 Are the people at Coda available on Internet or X.400 ?

Why is democracy better than tribalism or other means of Govt. ? The President of Georgia was elected with a thumping majority and booted out later , w/ no objections from the UN . Similarly , the people of Algeria elected an Islamic Fundemantalist Party into power but the junta declared it illegal .

My point is that it will inevitably turn out that way , and we can save ourselves a lot of pain and trouble by simply letting people sort out their problems on their own . Colonial interventions , even in Haiti , have n't worked in the past . They had a 102 coups from 1845-1915 . The US invaded in 1915 . And left in 1933 , almost 17 years after they had intended to . Was it a success ? Well , look at Haiti today and of the past 40 years and decide for yourself . It _was_ a success so long as the US was in , from what I remember . But it did n't last long , obviously . | > > There is an implicit assumption here that we as outsiders have a right to sit | > > in judgement of another people , and to then act on it .

I wonder why you say that ? I do n't see why having a spouse and/or kids would have anything to do with it . It might if you brought your kids to the game and wanted them to get home in time to get to bed at a reasonable hour ( in which case I 'd probably decide to take my kids to games on weekends , as many people do , or else be prepared to leave the game early ) , but from what you say later on , you do n't bring your kids *or* your spouse to the game .

Even without extra innings , if the score is beyond > 2-1 I ca n't see my family that night at all . If the next day is a workday , > I may have to bag that as well . I can see it 's a problem if you do n't bring your wife to the ballgame , but that 's a problem even if the game goes a trim 2 1/2 hours . As far as bagging work the next day , I do n't really understand why that's necessary , unless going to a game also means that you consume vast quantities of beer ( I note that this is the case for many guys ) .

Look : if I pay between $ 8.00 and $ 20.00 apiece for tickets , plus $ 10.00 for parking , plus spending my time and energy driving to and from Boston , plus spending additional money on concessions etc . at the ballpark , then I see going to a game as a considerable investment of time and money . I ca n't afford to go to a lot of games . Hence , going to a game is a big deal , like going to a play or an opera .

Still covering up the crimes of your fascist Armenian grandparents and Nazi Armenian parents ? Not a chance . As early as 1934 , K. S. Papazian asserted in 'Patriotism Perverted ' that the Armenians 'lean toward Fascism and Hitlerism . ' [ 1 ] At that time , he could not have foreseen that the Armenians would actively assume a pro-German stance and even collaborate in World War II . His book was dealing with the Armenian genocide of the Muslim population of Eastern Anatolia . However , extreme rightwing ideological tendencies could be observed within the Dashnagtzoutune long before the outbreak of the Second World War . In 1936 , for example , O. Zarmooni of the 'Tzeghagrons ' was quoted in the 'Hairenik Weekly : ' '' The race is force : it is treasure . If we follow history we shall see that races , due to their innate force , have created the nations and these have been secure only insofar as they have reverted to the race after becoming a nation . Today Germany and Italy are strong because as nations they live and breath in terms of race . On the other hand , Russia is comparatively weak because she is bereft of social sanctities . `` [ 2 ] [ 1 ] K. S. Papazian , 'Patriotism Perverted , ' ( Boston , Baikar Press 1934 ) , Preface . [ 2 ] 'Hairenik Weekly , ' Friday , April 10 , 1936 , 'The Race is our Refuge ' by O. Zarmooni . In April 1942 , Hitler was preparing for the invasion of the Caucasus . A number of Nazi Armenian leaders began submitting plans to German officials in spring and summer 1942 . One of them was Souren Begzadian Paikhar , son of a former ambassador of the Armenian Republic in Baku . Paikhar wrote a letter to Hitler , asking for German support to his Armenian national socialist movement Hossank and suggesting the creation of an Armenian SS formation in order '' to educate the youth of liberated Armenia according to the spirit of the Nazi ideas . '' He wanted to unite the Armenians of the already occupied territories of the USSR in his movement and with them conquer historic Turkish homeland . Paikhar was confined to serving the Nazis in Goebbels Propaganda ministry as a speaker for Armenian- and French-language radio broadcastings . [ 1 ] The Armenian-language broadcastings were produced by yet another Nazi Armenian Viguen Chanth . [ 2 ] [ 1 ] Patrick von zur Muhlen ( Muehlen ) , p. 106 . [ 2 ] Enno Meyer , A. J. Berkian , 'Zwischen Rhein und Arax , 900 Jahre Deutsch-Armenische beziehungen , ' ( Heinz Holzberg Verlag-Oldenburg 1988 ) , pp . 124 and 129 . The establishment of Armenian units in the German army was favored by General Dro ( the Butcher ) . He played an important role in the establishment of the Armenian 'legions ' without assuming any official position . His views were represented by his men in the respective organs . An interesting meeting took place between Dro and Reichsfuehrer-SS Heinrich Himmler toward the end of 1942 . Dro discussed matters of collaboration with Himmler and after a long conversation , asked if he could visit POW camp close to Berlin . Himmler provided Dro with his private car . [ 1 ] A minor problem was that some of the Soviet nationals were not 'Aryans ' but 'subhumans ' according to the official Nazi philosophy . As such , they were subject to German racism . However , Armenians were the least threatened and indeed most privileged . In August 1933 , Armenians had been recognized as Aryans by the Bureau of Racial Investigation in the Ministry for Domestic Affairs . [ 1 ] Meyer , Berkian , ibid. , pp . 112-113 . Need I go on ?

I guess I would react rather strongly to this line of thinking carried out !

( Although I 've already tried > many of the non-pharmacological solutions ) Well , I think you might want to visit a doctor who is familiar with sleep disturbances , because antihistamines only help induce sleep when they 're used intermittently ; they lose their sedative effect if they're used on a nightly basis . Their anticholinergic effects ( drying of secretions , relaxing effects on smooth muscle ) can be problematic in some people , such as those with glaucoma or prostate enlargement . Antihistamines like diphenhydramine ( Benadryl ) or doxylamine ( Unisom ) are potent sedatives which are useful occasionally . Chlorpheniramine ( Chlor-Trimeton ) is said to be less sedative , but 8mg seems to work well in some people . Both chlorpheniramine and doxylamine have long half-lives compared to diphenhydramine , and so may produce a residual hangover or `` drugged '' feeling the next morning . -- Steve Dyer dyer @ ursa-major.spdcc.com aka { ima , harvard , rayssd , linus , m2c } ! spdcc ! dyer

My school is discussing installing a Mac lab of 10 to 15 stations for our Bio 100 to 103 classes to do a study with pig disections . ( no joke ) Here is the deal . We can get this grant to do a study on if it is more feasible to do a disection via the computer or via the real thing . My problem is I was somehow drawn into this project ( being done by students who want to go Mac but know NADA about them , being the man mac man on campus , guess who they came to ? ) so I wnt to know what would probably be the best hardware to fill the follwoing list ? Right now we are looking at the C650 8/80 and the 2vx 5/80 platforms . Ok here it goes : We are using cd-rom , so ought we go with the internal Apple Cd-roms offered as options in the 650 and vx or go external . It is a matter of price and reliability , the second being VERY important . How much RAM ? I was thinking 5-8 more leaning towards 8 ? What do you think ? Ok , called apple educational discounts and they said their keyboard ( extended ) is 160.30 . Is it better to go with the Apple and their long time great wear and tear record , or is there a 3rd party extended keyboard that is just a reliable ? Price ? Printers : One color printer we are presently leaning towrds the Thermal Wax Tektronic 200e or 200i ( Probably the e as we are going to limit access so we do n't needed the i 's networkability ) So , what do you think in terms of color printers ? Different brand ? Kind ( Dye Sublimation ? Ink Jet ? ) Price ? Companies ? 1800 # s ? Also , we are looking to get a laser printer or such to network into the whole lab for noraml printing . The fornt runner is the Apple Pro650 ( is that right do n't have my notes here ? ) at 1650 . Suggestions ? We have kids using these things all day if this lab goes through and they know nothing about it for the most part . It has to be reliable , easy to maintain , and economical ( ie , not high priced paper cartidges , etc ) . Finally , and this is my little dig into the Project . What about netting these things ? We have ether nearby and I would like to slap the macs on the net , but , server ? Individual ether ? Forget about it it is going to be astronomically priced and the school is going to laugh at you when you ask them ? Little more info , I am a Poli Sci major who just happens to know alot about macs but this is a bit out of my league , not to mention I do n't have the time to go and look for all of this stuff .

BIOLOGICAL ALCHEMY ( ANOTHER Form of COLD FUSION ) ( ALTERNATIVE Heavy Element Creation in Universe ) A very simple experiment can demonstrate ( PROVE ) the FACT of `` BIOLOGICAL TRANSMUTATIONS '' ( reactions like Mg + O -- > Ca , Si + C -- > Ca , K + H -- > Ca , N2 -- > CO , etc . ) , as described in the BOOK `` Biological Transmutations '' by Louis Kervran , [ 1972 Edition is BEST . ] , and in Chapter 17 of the book `` THE SECRET LIFE OF PLANTS '' by Peter Tompkins and Christopher Bird , 1973 : ( 1 ) Obtain a good sample of plant seeds , all of the same kind . [ Some kinds might work better that others . ] ( 2 ) Divide the sample into two groups of equal weight and number . ( 3 ) Sprout one group in distilled water on filter paper for three or four weeks . ( 4 ) Separately incinerate both groups . ( 5 ) Weigh the residue from each group . [ The residue of the sprouted group will usually weigh at least SEVERAL PERCENT MORE than the other group . ] ( 6 ) Analyze quantitatively the residue of each group for mineral content . [ Some of the mineral atoms of the sprouted group have been TRANSMUTED into heavier mineral elements by FUSING with atoms of oxygen , hydrogen , carbon , nitrogen , etc.. ] BIOLOGICAL TRANSMUTATIONS occur ROUTINELY , even in our own bodies . Ingesting a source of organic silicon ( silicon with carbon , such as `` horsetail '' extract , or radishes ) can SPEED HEALING OF BROKEN BONES via the reaction Si + C -- > Ca , ( much faster than by merely ingesting the calcium directly ) .

The two reactions Si + C < -- > Ca , by micro-organisms , cause `` STONE SICKNESS '' in statues , building bricks , etc..

And our argument is that you can not remove them from the people who need restricting and not remove them from the people who do n't . A fairly simple problem , given our size and numbers . Do you agree ? We all believe criminals , particularly violent criminals , should not have firearms . The problem is making a law that does this without trodding upon the rights of the vast majority . Nobody here seems to be able to do it , and I doubt anybody in Norway can either . Thus , we are left with a philosophical difference : does the safety of a few justify restricting the many ? We say `` no , '' while others say `` yes . '' > Now IF you would like to reduce the number , how would you do it without > affecting good/responcible gun owners ? ? Can you provide a method that can not be abused ? I doubt it . > I DO believe in a persons freedom . > What I do n't believe is that you can have it all and do n't pay for it . Of course . This is not in contention . What is in contention is how much one has to pay . > MOST europeans believe in a society of individuals , and that you HAVE > to give ' a little ' to make that society work . It is this `` giving a little '' that makes Americans wary ... We have seen this argument before . You might remember how a Chamberlain `` gave a little '' to a particular fascist/short asshole , and how such `` appeasement '' worked . While it might work in some instances , it does n't work in others , and since we can not predict the future we must be cautious in using actions that have a history of failure . > Cars and guns should really not be mixed , I just tried to make a point . > Like America , Norway has some spaces you have to cross to get from a to b , > so a car is essential in most parts ... . > Guns on the other hand are not essential in Norway , so we do n't > argue that IF we 'banned ' guns we HAVE to ban cars ... .. Cars are not essential in Norway any more than they are in the USA . I 'm willing to bet that you have neighbors that would be willing to drive you anywhere you wanted to go for a price . Thus , cars are not essential for your transportation . However , the arguments presented show that , since cars are used to kill far more people than guns in the USA , it makes much more sense to restrict cars than it does guns . How one defines `` essential '' often depends upon what one is willing to go through for that service . When we look at the raw data , such comparisons are not individually weighed . > EVERYONE who believe that Hitler and WW2 could be avoided if there were > more guns in Germany in the 30 's : PLEASE read some HISTORY ! This depends upon what the populace was willing to do . As Desert Storm proved , even an armed populace wo n't just revolt even when given a chance . Still , would Hitler have done all that he did with an armed populace ? We have to wonder , as some of his first acts were to confiscate firearms . Other points in history show that dictators were overthrown by arms in the hands of the populace . Thus , we 're left wondering if Hitler would have been overthrown or if King George was just unlucky in keeping the USA as a colony . One can argue both sides ; one also has to live with each action . > Is this discussion about > 1 . Banning weapons for ALL Americans > or > 2 . Making it harder for criminals to get one ? ? It is about # 2 , but so far all proposals to curtail # 2 have wound up enforcing # 1 as well . I only wish that `` or '' was so logical . > Change of name ... ... .

From : Clinton-HQ @ Campaign92.Org ( The White House ) Subject : CLINTON : Fact Sheet on Russian Statement 4.23.93 Organization : MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab Lines : 167 NNTP-Posting-Host : life.ai.mit.edu The White House Office of the Press Secretary -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - For Immediate Release April 23 , 1993 Background Information : Advancing U.S. Relations with Russia and the other New Independent States April 23 , 1993 At the Vancouver summit , President Clinton and President Yeltsin agreed to pursue a number of measures designed to implement an economic and strategic partnership between the U.S. and Russia . Since then , President Clinton has directed that a number of steps be taken to move this process forward . The Administration is announcing a number of steps today in order to underscore its deep commitment to a new and closer partnership with Russia based on its government 's commitment to reform . Executive Review of Cold War Laws President Clinton and President Yeltsin discussed the desirability of reviewing and updating U.S. laws and regulations to reflect the end of the Cold War . Congress has already acted to revise many laws to reflect the fact that a communist Soviet Union has been replaced by a democratic Russia and other independent states . However , many laws and regulations remain that contain language and restrictions that fail to reflect the end of the Cold War and that unnecessarily undermine relations with Russia and the other new independent states . The President today has ordered an Executive review of laws and regulations so that , where appropriate and consistent with U.S. security and other national interests , such provisions can be revised or removed . He has asked Ambassador-at-large Strobe Talbott to coordinate this review on an expedited basis . The President has indicated that he will welcome congressional efforts to help this review proceed as quickly as possible . This review will weigh all considerations that pertain to revision of such provisions , and the initiation of the review may help to remedy some of the circumstances that have justified such provisions in the past . For example , because the Russians are eager to have their status changed under the Jackson-Vanik legislation , President Yeltsin personally assured President Clinton in Vancouver that he would look into individual cases involving continuing restrictions on emigration from Russia . By addressing such issues , this review can help strengthen the bonds of trust and partnership between the U.S. and Russia , and between the U.S. and the other new independent states . Review of COCOM It is also time to consider expeditiously with America 's allies the future of another Cold War institution -- the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls ( COCOM ) . The United States has begun a thorough review of how to reorient export controls to the post-Cold War world , in which Russia is no longer viewed as a potential adversary , but as a potential ally in combatting the proliferation of sensitive technology . Steps to Improve the Security Relationship The President also has taken steps to move ahead on a range of efforts discussed in Vancouver that can strengthen U.S. security and improve our security relationship with the Russians and the other states . Accelerated Deactivation of Nuclear Weapons In Vancouver , the two Presidents discussed accelerating the process of deactivating nuclear strategic systems scheduled for elimination under the START I Treaty . President Clinton has directed the Department of Defense to complete this process well in advance of the seven year reduction period outlined in START I . In addition , the United States , together with Russia and the other relevant states of the former Soviet Union , will be exploring programs under Nunn-Lugar to help them to accelerate this process . Multilateral Test Ban The two Presidents agreed at Vancouver that negotiations on a multilateral nuclear test ban should commence at an early date , and that the two governments would consult with each other accordingly . The United States looks forward to beginning consultations with Russia , our allies , and other states , on the specific issues related to this negotiation . The United States expects to start this consultative process within the next two months . Detargeting The two Presidents also began a dialogue on the issue of nuclear targeting at Vancouver . As the United States and Russia move into a new relationship of strategic partnership , there is a need to reexamine many of the assumptions and means employed in the past to safeguard U.S. security against a nuclear adversary . The Administration is beginning a comprehensive review of measures that could enhance strategic stability , including recent proposals for detargeting nuclear missiles . Other Measures to Create a New Security Relationship In response to the incident involving a collision between US and Russian submarines last month , Secretary Aspin will be ready to discuss ways to avoid such incidents in the future with Russian Defense Minister Grachev during his visit to the United States in late May . Secretary Aspin will also be prepared to move forward with Defense Minister Grachev in May to develop a combined training program between our two military forces and to prepare for joint exercises in peacekeeping , such as that authorized by the UN Security Council . The United States looks forward to broadening such training and exercises to include other peacekeeping contributors , in order to improve inter-operability , readiness , and planning for multilateral peacekeeping operations . The US and Russia are working together to convene a May Ministerial Meeting of the UN Security Council to discuss proposals for enhancing the UN 's peacekeeping capability and to move consideration of the Secretary-General 's Agenda for Peace from the discussion to the implementation phase . The U.S. is also working with the Russians to focus specifically on improvements in the financing and management of UN operations . The purpose of these initiatives will be to cooperate on peacekeeping for our participation in UN or CSCE sponsored actions . Multilateral and Bilateral Partnership with Reform Finally , the Administration continues to move ahead on a range of initiatives aimed at striking a partnership with economic and political reformers throughout Russia and the other states . The Administration is continuing work with our G-7 partners to assemble the package of multilateral assistance that Secretaries Bentsen and Christopher recently negotiated in Tokyo . And the Administration is continuing consultation with Congress over the further efforts the U.S. will take to assist the process of reform in Russia and the other states . * * * The Administration believes these steps can increase American security while improving the relationship between the U.S. and Russia , and between the U.S. and the other new independent states . -30-

We ca n't seem to > focus in on a disease , a therapy , or a hypothesis under discussion . > > I 'm lost ! Point 1 : I 'm beginning to see that *part* of the disagreements about the whole '' yeast issue '' is on differing perceptions and on differing meanings of words . Medical doctors have a very specific and specialized `` jargon '' , necessary for precise communication within their field ( which I 'm fully cognizant of since I , too , speak `` jargonese '' when with my peers ) . For the situation in sci.med , many times the words or phrases used by doctors can have a different and more specific meaning than the same word used in the world at large , causing significant miscommunication . One example word , and very relevant to the yeast discussion , is the exact meaning of `` systemic '' . It is now obvious to me that the meaning of this word is very specific , much more so than its meaning to a non-doctor . There is also the observation of this newsgroup that both doctors and non-doctors come together on essentially equal terms , which , when combined with the jargon issue , can further fan the flames . This is probably the first time that practicing doctors get really `` beat up '' by non-doctors for their views on medicine , which they otherwise do n't see much of in their practice except for the occasional '' difficult '' patient . Point 2 : I understand the viewpoint among many practicing doctors that they will not prescribe any treatments/therapies for their patients unless such treatments have been shown to be effective and the risks understood from well-constructed clinical trials ( usually double-blind ) , or that such treatments/therapies are part of an approved and funded clinical trial . To these doctors , to do any differently would , in this belief system , be unethical practice . And it follows that any therapy not on the `` accepted '' list is therefore a non- therapy - it does not even exist , nor does the underlying hypothesis or theory have any validity , even if it sounds very plausible by extrapolation of what is currently known . Anecdotal evidence has no value , either , from a treatment point-of-view . And by and large , as a scientist myself , I am glad that medical practice/ science takes such a rigorous approach to medical treatment . However , as also being a human being ( last I checked ) , and having been one of those people that has been significantly helped by a currently unaccepted treatment , where '' standard '' medicine was not able to help me , has caused me to sit back and wonder if holding such an extreme and rigid `` scientific '' viewpoint is in itself unethical from humanitarian considerations . After all , the underlying intent of the `` scientific '' approach to medicine is to protect the health of the patient by providing the best possible care for the patient , so the patient should come first when considering treatment . What we need is a slightly modified approach to treatment that satisfies both the `` scientific '' and the `` humanitarian '' viewpoints . In an earlier post I outlined a crazy idea for doing just that . The gist of it was to give any physician freedom and encouragement by the medical community to prescribe alternate , not yet proven therapies ( maybe supported by anecdotal evidence ) for patients who *all* avenues of accepted therapies have been exhausted ( and not until then ) . The patient would be fully informed that such therapies/treatments are not supported by the proper clinical trials and that there are real potential risks with real possibilities of no benefit derived from them . This approach satisfies the need for scientific rigor . It also satisfies the humanitarian needs of the patient . And the reality is that many patients who have reached a dead-end in the treatment of their symptoms using accepted medicine *will* go outside the orthodox medical community : either to the doctors who are brave enough to prescribe such treatments at the risk of losing their license , or worse , to non-doctors who have not had the proper medical training . This approach also recognizes this reality and keeps the control more within orthodox medicine , with the benefits that the information gleaned could help focus limited resources towards future clinical trials in the most productive way . Everybody wins in this admittedly rose-colored approach - I'm sure there are real problems with this approach as well - it is presented more as a strawman to stimulate discussion . Hopefully what I write here may give the sci.med doctors a better idea as to why I am `` open '' to alternative therapies , as well as why I have real difficulty ( read `` apparent hostility '' ) with the `` coldness '' of the 99.9 % pure '' scientific '' approach to medicine . I believe the best approach to medical treatment is one where both the `` humanitarian '' aspects are balanced with and by the `` scientific '' aspects .

According to the National Safety Council , ACCIDENT FACTS,1991 '' In 1990 , gun accidents were the fifth-leading cause of accidental death for children ages 14 and under .

A rational person would concentrate on motor vehicle deaths , and not attempt to affect childhood falls , drownings , gunshot injuries , etc. ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? So this so called rational person , ( using your definition ) , if he or she were attempting to affect the leading causes of deaths for adults aged 25 through 64 would only worry about cancer , and would not try to decrease LESSER CAUSES such as heart disease , injuries , stroke , suicide , liver disease , chronic lung disease , homicide , HIV infection , or diabetes . Oh , okay Charles , that makes a lot of sense . I tell you what Charles , I 'll call the Heart Foundation and suicide hotlines and tell them that they are not acting rational and that they can all go home because they are addressing the LESSER CAUSES of death . And you call your local police homicide department , liver foundation and diabetes foundation and tell them to stop addressing these lesser causes . Please , quit wasting my time with this silly shit Charles . I 've got an idea Charles , why do n't you start a talk.politics.caraccidents group or talk.politics.fall group ? This is talk.politics.guns . Don't confuse the issue . Just because a social problem may not claim as many victims as another , we should not try to address it ? I do n't agree . I 'm not posting to t.p.g to debate the supposed severity of causes of childhood deaths . I am really getting frigging sick of having to respond to the irrational statements of people who assume that someone who wants to discuss youth gun violence or unintentional youth gun deaths is trying to make a political issue out of it . > > I assumed that any humane > > person would be concerned when any 10 year old got hold of their parents > > gun from their bedroom drawer and accidently blew away one of their friends . > > A `` humane person '' who keeps a firearm in the house with a 10 year old > would also teach this child how to safely handle the firearm ; > Ignorance is our greatest enemy . > Again Charles , you tend to confuse the issue and take things out of context for your own purposes . The statement that you responded to above is actually in reference to a previous post by another person who , like you , expressed concern over making youth gun violence a priority . I guess , maybe Humane person and Rational person could be interchangeable huh ? Both would be defined as `` a person who only addresses the social problem that causes the greatest number of childhood deaths . '' If that is the case , I 'm extremely glad that I am inhumane and irrational . > > Well Joe , I suggest that you talk to the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence > ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ > What _other_ sources of information do you have which confirms their > data ? These folks are well known for misrepresenting the facts . > Perhaps you can verify their data with the Uniform Crime Report ... > Sorry Charles , the FBI Uniform Crime Report is WELL known for misrepresenting the facts . But if you insist , according to the 1990 UCR , `` Firearm murders of youngsters 19 and under increased 125 percent between 1984 and 1990 '' Is the National Center for Health Statistics good enough for you ? They state that `` Every day , 12 American children ages 19 and under are killed in gun accidents , suicides , and homicides . Many more are wounded '' . Or how about the National Pediatric Trauma Registry ? They say `` Gunshot wounds to children ages 16 and under nearly doubled in major urban areas between 1987 and 1990 . '' Do you also doubt the American Academy of Pediatrics Charles ? ? ? They state that `` Gunshot wounds among children in urban areas increased 300 % from 1986 to 1988 . '' Charles , I hope you do n't need to be convinced that youth are increasingly victims of gun injuries and that they have easy access to guns . If you don't realize this fact , ( I do n't care if you go by CDC or FBI data , or if you go into the homes , schools , and streets where these kids are and take a poll by yourself ) , I 'm not going to bother to try to convince you . Its obvious that you have ruled out any idea of discussing this issue in a sane fashion and that you are so focused on trying to make this a gun control and political discussion .

As a physicist , I realize that you probably do n't come into contact with many youth , but I REALLY think you need to make a trip to your local urban high school and discover the joy of guns in schools . In addition spend a few minutes talking to these kids . Ask them if they have ever heard gunshots in their neighborhoods , whether they know anyone who has been shot , whether they know anyone who has a gun , whether they have ever held a gun , and whether they themselves have ever been shot .

Make sure that all your drivers ( HIMEM , EMM386 , SMARTDRV ) are being executed from the DOS directory . Loss of the cache provided by SMARTDRV could be your problem ; if not , I do n't know what might cause the startup delay . My testbed for DBLSPACE ( which has a *very* minimal amount of data on the disk so that I don't eat up too much time as I install and uninstall DBLSPACE ) boots in about 20 seconds from the `` Starting MS-DOS '' herald to the end of the AUTOEXEC.BAT execution . I do n't have handy a system with a more realistic volume of data to time . Joe Morris / MITRE

I took me a long time to come to the conclusion that there is a difference between a *member* of a '' rosicrucian '' body and BEING *a* ROSICRUCIAN . So when you say that you met some 'rosicrucians ' you mean `` members of a group that calls themselves rosicrucian '' . At least that is what your observation suggests : - ) Response : This makes much sense to me . This is also true of most religions . There is a difference between being a *member* of a group of people who call themselves 'Hindus ' or 'Christians ' or 'Pagans ' and actually *BEING* any of these . The social groups tend to make very important requirements about not belonging to other 'religions ' . I find that the ideal described by the holy texts of most religions can be interpreted in very similar ways so that one could presume that 'mysticism ' is the core of every religion and Huxley 's 'Perennial Philosophy ' is the Great Secret Core of all mystical trads . : > Tony : I 'd prefer if you would have stated up front that it was the Lectorium Rosicrucianum , only because they may be confused , by some readers of this newsgroup , with the Rosicrucian Order AMORC based ( the USA Jurisdiction ) in San Jose , CA ; this being the RC org with the most members ( last time I looked ) . Of course , `` most members '' does not *necessarily* mean `` best '' . Response : Certainly true . I did n't know there WERE any groups which called themselves 'Rosicrucians ' that did n't associate with AMORC . Sure , I 've heard all the hubbub about the Golden Dawn and Rosae Crucis in relation to all these Western esoteric groups , but had n't heard about other 'Rosicrucians ' . I 'll admit my bias . I live in San Jose . : > Tony : '' You 'll have to trust me '' when I tell you that if that lecture/class/whatever had been presented by AMORC , it is unlikely that you would have had the same impression , i.e. , you 'd probably have had a positive impression more likely than a negative one , IMHO . Response : This may be slightly off . I 've met some of these Rosicrucians and have a couple friends in AMORC . The stories I 've heard and the slight contact I 've had with them does not give me the hope that I 'd be received with any kind of warm welcome . I still like to think that most people who are involved with stratified relationships ( monogamy , religion , etc . ) are in DEEP pain and hope to heal it within such a 'cast ' . Tony : It is curious to know that 3 other RC 'orders ' ( in the USA ) claim to be *non- sectarian* . Response : I 'd like to know at least the addresses of the 'other orders ' which call themselves 'Rosicrucians ' and especially those which are 'nonsectarian ' . Is this 'nonsectarian ' like the Masons , who require that a member 'believe in God by his/her definition ' ? Tony : I do n't see nothing *fundamentally* wrong with `` us containing something divine '' ... And yes I do n't like phrases like `` eternal bliss '' either ! : - ) Response : Let alone us *BEING* something divine . ; > Tony : BTW , I have read the intro letters of the LRC which they will mail you free of charge .

Newer studies hint that it might be less > than a degree . Of course , then there 's the other side . An article in yesterday 's Atlanta Journal stated that there are many scientists who have misgivings that the data being used to determine whether or not global warming is occuring is faulty . The point that the article made is that all long term temperature dataa collected has been in urban areas , and that any heat rise can be attributed to the growth and urbanization of the area . They called it the `` asphalt temperature trend '' . We have no real long term data on remote areas , such as the middle of the Amazon rain forest , or the top of Mt . Everest or the Gobi desert , for that matter . An accompanying article mentioned that a group of scientists at NASA had developed a method for using a satellite to collect temperature data globally , and that preliminary results showed a slight downward trend attributed to the Mt Pinatubo eruption . It went on to say that even with the current downward trend , there appeared to be *NO* change in global temperatures using trend prediction methods for at least the next 50 years .

So , you approve of the BATF launching a 100-person raid , complete with flack jackets , men hidden in horse trailers , stun grenades , semi-auto weapons on peaceful citizens ? who would also accept a search authoried by a court ? There is still no proof that the Branch Davidians had illegal weapons . Nothing else was in the jurisdiction of the BATF , unless they were thought to have a still , or be smoking untaxed cigarettes . The automatic firearms violation is a TAX matter !
