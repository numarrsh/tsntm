It is a failure of libertarianism if the ideology does not provide any reasonable way to restrain such actions other than utopian dreams .

In this case , '' limited '' and `` big '' government are not defined . I would point out that Lebanon , Somalia , and the former Yugoslavia are by some definitions nations with `` limited '' government , while the US , Canada , and nations in Western Europe ( where `` people would rather live '' ) are often pointed out as nations with `` big government '' from a libertarian point of view . The argument is not between those who want `` limited '' government and those who want `` unlimited '' government . It is between those who believe government regulation in a capitalist economy serves worthwhile ends and those who believe such regulation is neither desirable on empirical grounds nor justifiable on ideological grounds . jsh > -- > Paul Schmidt : Advocates for Self-Government , Davy Crockett Chapter President -- Steve Hendricks | DOMAIN : steveh @ thor.ISC-BR.COM '' One thing about data , it sure does cut| UUCP : ... ! uunet ! isc-br ! thor ! steveh the bulls**t.

Khomeini supports this view of the Twelve Imans . This is > heresy for the very reasons I gave above . I would be happy to discuss the issue of the 12 Imams with you , although my preference would be to move the discussion to another newsgroup . I feel a philosophy or religion group would be more appropriate . The topic is deeply embedded in the world view of Islam and the esoteric teachings of the Prophet ( S.A. ) . Heresy does not enter into it at all except for those who see Islam only as an exoteric religion that is only nominally ( if at all ) concerned with the metaphysical substance of man 's being and nature . A good introductory book ( in fact one of the best introductory books to Islam in general ) is Murtaza Mutahhari 's `` Fundamental's of Islamic Thought - God , Man , and the Universe '' - Mizan Press , translated by R. Campbell . Truly a beautiful book . A follow-up book ( if you can find a decent translation ) is `` Wilaya - The Station of the Master '' by the same author . I think it also goes under the title of `` Master and Mastership '' - It 's a very small book - really just a transcription of a lecture by the author . The introduction to the beautiful `` Psalms of Islam '' - translated by William C. Chittick ( available through Muhammadi Trust of Great Britain ) is also an excellent introduction to the subject . We have these books in our University library - I imagine any well stocked University library will have them . From your posts , you seem fairly well versed in Sunni thought . You should seek to know Shi'ite thought through knowledgeable Shi'ite authors as well - at least that much respect is due before the charge of heresy is levelled . As salaam a-laikum

Reply-To : roeber @ cern.ch Organization : CERN -- European Organization for Nuclear Research Lines : 24 I 'm writing an X server for some video-generation equipment . The hardware is `` truecolor '' in YUV space ; in X terms it has a 24-bit static color visual . I would really like to have the server just present this static visual , but I 'm not sure if this will be acceptable to `` most '' X clients . The three problems I see are : 1 ) The colormap , though huge , is static . 2 ) All pixels would be 3 bytes wide . 3 ) Because the hardware actually lives in YUV space , the translation RGB- > YUV will introduce some rounding error . Being more of a server guy than a client guy , I ask : will these limitations thwart many X clients ? Or will most of the X stuff floating around blithely accept what they 're given ? I could write the server to also present a pseudocolor visual of , e.g. , 8 bits , but I 'd rather avoid this if not necessary .

If you do n't already know it , you should call the bank/credit union/ finance company that holds the loan on your present car and get the current payoff cost . If you are trading in your current car on the new car , subtract the payoff amount from the trade-in the dealer is giving you . ( If this turns out to be a negative number , you need to reconsider the deal . ) Subtract this difference from the price of the new car . This is the size of the loan you will need for the new car .

The gravity maneuvering that was used was to exploit 'fuzzy regions ' . These are described by the inventor as exploiting the second-order perturbations in a three body system . The probe was launched into this region for the earth-moon-sun system , where the perturbations affected it in such a way as to allow it to go into lunar orbit without large expenditures of fuel to slow down . The idea is that 'natural objects sometimes get captured without expending fuel , we 'll just find the trajectory that makes it possible '' . The originator of the technique said that NASA was n't interested , but that Japan was because their probe was small and could n't hold a lot of fuel for deceleration .

It started happening about four years ago after I moved to my current town , although I do n't know if that has anything to do with anything . Severity and persistance of the rash seems to vary with the fever : a severe or long-lasting fever brings a long-lasting rash . A mild fever seems to bring rashes that go away faster . Anybody know what might be causing this ? It 's no more than an embarassment , but I 'd be curious to know what 's going on .

What you want are Meguiar 's Mirror Glaze Plastic Polish and Plastic Cleaner . They are very mild abrasives meant to remove scratches from plastic . For fine scratches just use the Polish , for bigger ones start with the Cleaner and finish with the Polish . The stuff is $ 5-8 bucks per bottle at most auto or motorcycle parts stores . Do n't choke over the price too much , since both bottles will probably last you 10 years .

The New Testament does > record that Jews believed the body had been stolen . If there were really > guards , they could not have effectively made this claim , as they did . Of course they knew where it was . Do n't forget that Jesus was seen by both the Jews and the Romans as a troublemaker . Pilate was no fool and did n't need the additional headaches of some fishermen stealing Jesus ' body to make it appear He had arisen . Since Jesus was buried in the grave of a man well know to the Sanhedrin , to say that they did n't know where He was buried begs the question . Now , you say that you think that the disciples stole the body . But think on this a moment . Would you die to maintain something you KNEW to be a deliberate lie ! ? If not , then why do you think the disciples would ! ? Now , I'm not talking about dying for something you firmly believe to be the truth , but unbeknown to you , it is a lie . Many have done this . No , I 'm talking about dying , by beheading , stoning , crucifixion , etc. , for something you know to be a lie ! Thus , you position with regards to the disciples stealing the body seems rather lightweight to me . As for graverobbers , why risk the severe penalties for grave robbing over the body of Jesus ? He was n't buried with great riches . So , again , this is an argument that can be discounted . That leaves you back on square one . What happened to the body ! ?

I know that when working in Alberta , Ontario and Quebec , I was aware that I was paying for health insurance - e.g. , in Toronto , OHIP fees were listed seperately on my pay stub . While I 'm not the only Canadian who favours lower taxes and cutbacks in spending , health insurance is n't on the table . See our polls ... A better one might be the July 1st polls conducted for Macleans ( our major English newsmagazine ) by Decima Research ... Decima president Allen Gregg is considered one of the world 's top poll researchers , and Mulroney 's Conservatives have relied on him to keep in power in the face of impossible election situations . I have n't had a chance to see this year 's version due to our library , but previous ones before the Americans started their assault and disinformation had shown satisfaction at 97 % and switching to an American all-private system had support within statistical noise . The Decima polls are considered definitive . Even the new Reform Party , a breakoff of traditionalists from the Conservatives with a mildly `` libertarian '' faction , hold our public health insurance as an untouchable but that just a few people have to be reminded that it 's not free ( the average Canadian/European is more fiscally naive than their American counterparts on issues like these ) . Personally , I feel that the universal health insurance approach used in Canada , France and Germany -- paying to private health providers in a nominally free market not unlike America 's , minus HMO 's -- depends a lot on values in those societies different from the U.S . The basic health needs for life are not viewed as market , but the insurance does allow the market to address that -- basic health care is not viewed on the level of ownership of a VCR as Americans would see it . Plenty of room is left for expenditure of private funds as extra insurance or as > Lastly , there were noises about how the Canadian system was not > containing costs , but , in fact , their system is currently bankrupt .

Otherwise , they would probably have gone for a commercial Unix . An important factor in the Linux community is that source code is always available ( this is probably similar in the 386BSD community , however , I 'm not really involved there ) . Many people using Linux like to stay at the cutting ( bleeding ) edge : ie . when kernel patches , C library or compiler patches come out , people like to rebuild their entire systems . The prime requirement for all Linux software is that it is available under a GNU style public license . Hence , Linux software uses either the Athena widgets or XView .

The federal government has an interest in the intent of the perpetrators in the pursuit of preventing violations of civil rights . It 's the way they broke the back of the Klan , by putting a lot of people away for a very long time for harrassing blacks specifically . It is a principle that has been well recognized as constitutionally valid since over 100 years ago . It has been used whenever a select group was getting bashed or harrassed more than any other person would just for being part of a minority . It is the only way we made the defeat of the south stick after the Civil War . People who harrassed free blacks , when normally they would n't find themselves harrassing just anyone walking around were expeditiously tried and jailed for 5 to 8 years until nobody wanted to try it anymore . Now with the 14th amendment guarantee of equal protection under the law , the law can use multiple crime and severe penalty involving intent as much as is needed to protect even one human that is a hated minority to somebody . They can call out the national guard just for them , as they did the school girls in Alabama during desegregation in the 1950 's , and the president can nationalize the state militia and turn the guns of the militia that were being used to bar blacks right around to point at the thousands in the crowd with an order to shoot that they would have to obey or face possible death by firing squad under the Uniform Code of Military Justice for failing to obey a direct order while under arms ! And by god , they did ! Those southern boys turned right around an fixed bayonets ! And the governor was left standing and was arrested by the federal marshalls that had brought the order to nationalize the guard .

No one in his right mind would sell his freedom and dignity . Palestinians are no exception . Perhaps you heard about anti-trust in the business world . Since we are debating the legality of a commercial transaction , we must use the laws governing the guidelines and ethics of such transactions . Basic ANTI-TRUST law says that , while you can purchase IBM stocks for the purpose of investing , you can not acquire a large number of those shares with the intent or controlling IBM . You can do so only if you make your intentions CLEAR apriori . Clearly , the Jews who purchased properties from palastenians had some designs , they were not buying a dwelling or a real estate . They were establishing a bridgehead for the European Jews . The palastenians sold their properties to the Jews in the old tradition of arab hospitality . Being a multi-ethnic / multi-religious society , accepting the jews as neighbours was no different , just another religion . Plus they paid fair market value , etc ... They did not know they were victims of an international conspiracy . ( I 'm not a conspiracy theorist myself , but this one is hard to dismiss ) . > > As to whether the Jews wanted to live in peace , maybe . > > However they wanted and still want an exclusively Jewish > > state , where Jews are in control and Jews are the masters of > > the land .

I do n't want to get on a tangent here but its the same reasonning that says its OK to return 100 deportes and leave the rest . Because 100 is a nice number that you can devide by 10 , 100 and besides , it has an integer square root . > > Those palestinians who stayed , actually stayed despite of what > > happened , and their number was somewhat tolerated as a defenseless > > and ineffective minority . > > If I were wrong , you 'd have Israel recall all the > > palestinian refugees ( we 're talking millions ) .

My experience tells me that every palestinian I knew still keeps the key to his home , in Palestine . Besides they often refer to their exodus as an escape from hell ( so to speak ) . I know none that agrees with you . Did you sample their opinions ? I know you do n't care , just being rethorical . > > Israel gave citizenship to the remaining arabs because it > > had to maintain a democratic facade ( to keep the western aid > > flowing ) . > Israel got no western aid in 1948 , nor in 1949 or 50 ...

I beleive that Israel is democratic within the constraints of one dominant ethnic group ( Jews ) . Israel probably had a few options after 1948 : ethnic cleansing Serbian style , and deserve the wrath of the international community , or make the best out of a no win condition : show the world how good Israel is towards the 'bad ' arabs .

I have a Sparc-1 with very limited disk space on /usr partition . previously , i was able to run all x-windows applications and then i upgraded my system to sun o.s . 4.1.3 and realized that , the hard disk did not have enough space to load openwindows . My immediate alternative was to load only the neccessary files to boot the system . This resulted in not loading openwindows . As a result of which none of the X-libraries got loaded . I am trying to load just the libraries and include files and bin/X11 files required for running X-windows and compiling my programs written for Xlib and Xaw . In a desperate effort to regain x-windows , i retrieved /usr/lib/libX* . * files from the tape . /usr/bin/X11/* and /usr/include/X11/* . Is this enough for running X-windows BUt i did not get /usr/lib/X11/fonts/ sub directories . these are mainly 100dpi , 75dpi and misc . when i run xinit , the error message says /usr/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi etc are not in the default path . But the problem is i can not load any of those directories as there is no disk space . Are there any temporary suggestions before I get a 1.5 GB disk and load openwindows , to just have my x-windows running . Thanks Pramod --

This will be the the first time I 've taken anyone for an extended ride ( read : farther than around the block : - ) . We 'll be riding some twisty , fairly bumpy roads ( the Mines Road-Mt.Hamilton Loop for you SF Bay Areans ) . Communication : work out your own system . Or just slow down and holler back every once in a while . At reasonable speeds , even on my under-muffled Magna , we can hear each other . It 's only above , say , 45 MPH that you ca n't really communicate . Balance : New passengers are a real pain , because you never know how they 're going to react to steering . Some people catch on immediately and lean with me . Others are completely skittish about the leaning thing , and keep their bodies perpendicular to the horizon . This is a pain while turning , but manageable . The WORST are the passengers who stay perpendicular to the horizon , then REMEMBER in the middle of a turn and WHIP AROUND until they 're in the ` correct ' position . This always screws up the line I 've picked out . Here 's my personal checklist of things to tell passengers : - attire : helmet , long pants , boots/heavy shoes , jacket . - Keep feet on pegs at all times , unless I say otherwise . Do not get on/off unless I say you can . ( I 've had people try to dismount in traffic , just as I 'm pulling in to a parking space ! ) - Muffler gets HOT ! ( 'Nuff said ) - We get *GOOD* traction . We 're not going to fall over . ( Many first-time riders are surprised by how tightly you can turn ! ) - Turn dynamics : sit so that you feel like you 're sitting upright and we 're going straight . Trust your butt , not your eyes -- if you're confused , close your eyes for a couple of turns to get the feel of it . Or just hug me tight . - Please , no sudden moves -- shift your weight as desired , but be gradual , so I can compensate . - Your faceplate is yours to open/close as desired . - Trust is essential . Trust the driver ( me ) to do the right thing -- I 've driven many miles on this thing , and know how to operate it . Enjoy the ride . ( This is important to stress . For example , one of my first-time passwngers seemed to watch the speedo like a hawk : I drove her to the beach down 84 , and whever we topped 35 mph , she 'd holler , `` SLOW DOWN ! I 'M SCARED '' I humored her for a while , then simply covered the speedometer with the spare piece of duct tape I keep stuck to the top of the cluster . Problem solved : she watched the scenery instead of the instruments , and had a much better time . Based on her experience driving a Lincoln Continental , she was unwilling to trust my ability to choose a safe speed for the bike . ) Usually I 'll point out the controls , engine , transmission , brakes , tires , etc . and discuss motorcycle physics a bit too for first-timers . Helps calm their nerves , and gives the bike a chance to warm up . Watch out for gravel on the Mt . Hamilton road : there were lots of little mudslides after the last big rain ; by now , many of the blind corners will be nicely covered with a carpet of little , round , nearly invisible stones . It does n't help build trust when you slide out on a blind corner , on the first trip ! Good luck -- have fun ! -- DO N'T DRINK SOAP ! DILUTE DILUTE ! OK !

A few months later the same pain returned . The doctor said that he could find nothing wrong in the area of the hernia repair . Now the pain occurs more often . My GP could n't identify any specific problem . The surgen who performed the original procedure now says that yes there is a `` new '' hernia in the same area and he said that he has to cut into the area for the repair this time .

I was unable to put it down the first time I read it , but others have found it dry . It has numberable references and illustrations . If you are interested in purchasing your own copy , you can call Moody Book Store @ ( 312 ) 329-4352 and order it for $ 16.99 and they will ship it to you . It is a good book just to get the reference titles for your own digs into the mystery religions . I have found it invaluable for that purpose alone . But for those who only want to skim the subject , it comes highly recommended . Just a note to my RC brothers and sisters . You may find this to be a diatribe or you may find it to be a test to the origin and true nature of the origin of RCism . If you are offended by anything that asks hard questions about your denomination ( as to whether or not it is `` Christian '' ) then perhaps you should just passover this offer . To those who are a little more adventurous , go for it and later , please contact me with you reasons pro or con on the scholorship of this book .

If you do sincerely believe that a god exists , why do you follow > it blindly ? > Do the words `` Question Authority '' mean anything to you ? > I defy any theist to reply . Dear Defiant ( or Unfaithful or Pixie ) : I will take up the challenge to reply , as I am a theist . The foundation for faith in God is reason , without which the existence of God could not be proven . That His existence can be proven by reason is indisputable ( cf . my short treatise , `` Traditional Proofs for the Existence of God , '' and Summa Theologica ) . Now , given that God exists , and that His existence can be proven by reason , I assert that His commands must be followed blindly , although in our fallen condition we must always have some measure of doubt about our faith . Why ? Because God is the First Cause of all things , the First Mover of matter , the Independent Thing that requires nothing else for its existence , the Measure of all that is perfect , and the essential Being who gives order to the universe ( logos ) . I next assert that God is all good . If this is so , then that which is contrary to the will of God is evil ; i.e. , the absence of the good . And , since God can never contradict Himself , then by His promise of a Savior as early as the Protoevangelium of Genesis 3:5 , God instructs that because a human ( Adam ) was first responsible for man 's alienation from the Source of all good , a man would be required to act to restore the friendship . Thus God became incarnate in the person of the Messiah . Now this Messiah claimed that He is the Truth ( John 14:6 ) . If this claim is true , then we are bound by reason to follow Him , who is truth incarnate . You next seem to have a problem with authority . Have you tried the United States Marine Corps yet ? I can tell you first-hand that it is an excellent instructor in authority . If you have not yet had the privilege , I will reply that the authority which is Truth Incarnate may never be questioned , and thus must be followed blindly . One may NOT deny the truth . For example , when the proverbial apple fell on Isaac Newton 's head , he could have denied that it happened , but he did not . The laws of physics must be obeyed whether a human likes them or not . They are true . Therefore , the Authority which is Truth may not be denied . QED -- boundary no teneis que pensar que yo haya venido a traer la paz a la tierra ; no he venido a traer la paz , sino la guerra ( Mateo 10:34 , Vulgata Latina )

You are probably wondering why I must sell the case with the motherboard . It is simply because the case is custom-made for this particular board and you would be hard-pressed to fit another MB in it . However , the case and this motherboard were made to go together and fit perfectly . As you can see , since this board includes drive controllers AND a video controller , you can save some money by buying this unit and not a MB where you would need to get IO cards , video card , and drive controllers Its just a lot more convenient on the whole I would like to ask about $ 500 for this whole package . I think this is a fair price given the facts that it includes a video card and drive controllers/IO ports . All you need to do is add drives , a monitor , RAM , and a keyboard . Also keep in mind that it is n't a generic board , but from CompuAdd . I also will entertain all serious offers . Please email at jmu @ acpub.duke.edu Thanks -J

What does it mean to be 'Tao 'd ' ? It seems to me that these questions more properly fall into the category of `` general metaphysics '' . I would prefer any misc.taoism to deal more closely with topics and works more closely associated with at least `` semi-orthodox '' Taoism : with established classic works definitely included and works like Mantak Chia 's argued about ! I think `` neo-Taoism '' should be excluded or get its own group ( what I mean by this is `` Humpty-Dumpty Taoism '' , in which Taoism means whatever a poster says it means . ) This `` alt.taoism '' could also be a refuge for debates about what `` Taoism *REALLY* means '' or speculations on sexual alchemy , etc.. e.g .

I think that discussions of this nature are not completely out of place . What 's happening is that that the term `` Taoism '' is becoming completely polluted and trivialized like the words `` magic '' , `` Alchemy '' , '' Zen , '' etc. , by writers appropriating the word to mean whatever they want . This is seen by the spate of new age books entitled `` The Tao of '' this , that , and everything else . ( With respect to some exceptions like the books by Jou , Tsung-Hwa . ) Any other comments/ideas ? I look forward to seeing them . On balance , I say let misc.taoism rip and let the chips fall where they may . If it just gets filled up with college freshmen asking about the Tao of Sex then it will have been a failure and people will post to these groups just as they do now . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Tim P.

I hear Vida > that pilots and steward/esses have a limit as to the maximum Vida > number of flying hours -- what are these limits ? What are the Vida > main problems associated with too many long-haul ( over 4 hours ) Vida > trips ? The crew rest requirements are to prevent undue fatigue . The cockpit crew ( pilot ) limits are somewhat more stringent than the cabin crew limits for this reason . Crew rest requirements address amount of time on duty plus rest time . A tired crew is an accident-prone crew . The only limits I know of for inner-ear problems are in military aircraft , which are frequently unpressurized or less reliably pressurized . Not being able to clear the ears renders aircrew members DNIF ( duties not involving flying ) or grounded until the ears clear . Flying can accentuate problems if ears do n't clear . If you do n't have big pressure changes , you may not know that you 've got a problem . But if you zip up to 5,000 or 6,000 ft ( the usual cabin altitude in an airliner ) and then back down to sea level , you may discover a problem . Ears do n't clear readily because of allergies , colds , infections , and anatomical problems . The last wo n't change ; the first three can . Medication ( decongestants or antihistimines , usually ) can help .

I Peter 3:7 One interpretation I 've heard of this verse is that it refers to the sin of physically abusing one 's wife . The husband is usually physically stronger than his wife but is not permitted to use this to dominate her . He must honor her as his sister in Christ . This would therefore be an example of a specific sin that blocks prayer . This verse also makes me think of the kind of husband who decides what is God 's will for his family without consulting his wife . God reveals His will to both the husband and the wife . There needs to be some degree of mutuality in decision making . Even those whose understanding of the Bible leads to a belief in an authoritarian headship of the husband need to incorporate this in order to have a functional family . One way to look at it is that God speaks to the wife through the husband and to the husband through the wife . Jayne Kulikauskas/ jayne @ mmalt.guild.org

A much more likely explanation is the classic one : that the clockwise swastika is the Sun-wheel , because the sun progresses across the sky that way . ( Although that 's not the historical way it happened ; clocks were first made as little imitation images of the sun moving thru the heavens . So it 's more valid to talk of the clock going sunwise , but do the engineers listen to me ? Of course not . ) Anyway , there is still much uncertainty about whether the anti-swastika goes counter-sunwise because that represents Evil , or because it is the Sun 's twin-opposite , the Moonwheel .

If it means specifically that the marriage ceremony is n't described , then that seems to be true . But I think what most people mean by Christian marriage is not so much that it takes place in a church as that the parties undertake the various commitments to each other that are associated with marriage in the Bible . -- clh ]

Armenians DO REMEMBER of the TURKISH invasion of the Greek island of > CYPRESS WHILE the world simply WATCHED . And the 'Turkish Karabag ' is next . As for 'Cyprus ' , In 1974 , Turkiye stepped into Cyprus to preserve the lives of the Turkish population there . This is nothing but a simple historical fact . Unfortunately , the intervention was too late at least for some of the victims . Mass graves containing numerous bodies of women and children already showed what fate had been planned for a peaceful minority . The problems in Cyprus have their origin in decades of oppression of the Turkish population by the Greek Cypriot officials and their violation of the co-founder status of the Turks set out in the constitution . The coup d'etat engineered by Greece in 1974 to execute a final solution to the Turkish problem was the savage blow that invoked Turkiye 's intervention . Turkiye intervened reluctantly and only as a last resort after exhausting all other avenues consulting with Britain and Greece as the other two signatories to the treaty to protect the integrity of Cyprus . There simply was not any expansionist motivation in the Turkish action at all . This is in dramatic contrast to the Greek motivation which was openly expansionist , stated as 'Enosis , ' union with Greece . Since the creation of independent Cyprus in 1960 , the Turkish population , although smaller , legally had status as the co-founder of the republic with the Greek population . The Greek Cypriots , with the support of 'Enosis'-minded Greeks in the mainland , have consistently ignored that status and portrayed the Island as a Greek island with a minority population of Turks . The Turks of Cyprus are not a minority in a Greek Republic and they found the only way they could show that was to assert their autonomy in a separate republic . Turkiye is not satisfied with the status quo . She would rather not be involved with the island . But , given the dismal record of brutal Greek oppression of the Turkish population in Cyprus , she simply can not leave the fate of the island 's Turks in the hands of the Greeks until the Turkish side is satisfied with whatever accord the two communities finally reach to guarantee that history will not repeat itself to rob Turkish Cypriots of their rights , liberties and their very lives . Source : 'Cyprus : The Tale Of An Island , ' A. H. Rizvi , p. 42 21-12-1963 Throughout Cyprus `` Following the Greek Cypriot premeditated onslaught of 21 December , 1963 , the Turkish Sectors all over Cyprus were completely besieged by Greeks ; all telephonic , telegraphic and postal communications between these sectors were cut off and the Turkish Cypriot Community 's contact with each other and with the outside world was thus prevented . '' 21-12-63 -- 31-12-63 Turkish Quarter of Nicosia and suburbs `` Greek Cypriot armed elements broke into hundreds of Turkish homes and fired at the unarmed occupants with automatic weapons killing at random many Turks , including women , children and elderly persons ( 51 Turks were killed and 82 wounded ) . They also carried away as hostages more than 700 Turks , including women and children , whom they forced to walk bare-footed and in night-dresses across rough fields and river beds . '' 21-12-63 -- 12-12-64 Throughout Cyprus `` The Greek Cypriot Administration deprived Turkish Cypriots including Ministers , MPs , and Turkish members of the Public services of the republic , of their right to freedom of movement . '' In his report No . S/6102 of 12 December , 1964 to the Security Council , the UN Secretary-General stated in this respect the following : `` Restrictions on the free movement of civilians have been one of the major features of the situation in Cyprus since the early stages of the disturbances , these restrictions have inflicted considerable hardship on the population , especially the Turkish Cypriot Community , and have kept tension high .

[ .. ] 13-3-1975 On the road travelling to the South to the freedom of the North `` A Turkish woman was seriously wounded and her four-month old baby was riddled with bullets from an automatic weapon fired by a Greek Cypriot mobile patrol which had ambushed the car in which the mother and her baby were travelling to the Turkish region . The baby died in her mother 's arms . This wanton murder of a four-month-old baby , which shocked foreign observers as much as the Turkish Community , was not committed by irresponsible persons , but by members of the Greek Cypriot security forces . According to the mother 's statement the Greek police patrol had chased their car and deliberately fired upon it .

This summarises the general conclusions of 135 speakers and 300 participants at the Conference on Olympus Utilisation held in Seville on 20-22-April 1993 . The conference was organised by the European Space Agency ( ESA ) and the Spanish Centre for the Development of Industrial Technology ( CDTI ) . OLYMPUS has been particularly useful : - in bringing satellite telecommunications to thousands of new users , thanks to satellite terminals with very small antennas ( VSATs ) . OLYMPUS experiments have tested data transmission , videoconferencing , business television , distance teaching and rural telephony , to give but a few examples . - in opening the door to new telecommunications services which could not be accommodated on the crowded lower- frequency bands ; OLYMPUS was the first satellite over Europe to offer capacity in the 20/30 GHz band . - in establishing two-way data relay links OLYMPUS received for the first time in Europe , over several months , high-volume data from a low-Earth orbiting spacecraft and then distributed it to various centres in Europe . When OLYMPUS was launched on 12 July 1989 it was the world 's largest telecommunications satellite ; and no other satellite has yet equalled its versatility in combining four different payloads in a wide variety of frequency bands . OLYMPUS users range from individual experimenters to some of the world 's largest businesses . Access to the satellite is given in order to test new telecommunications techniques or services ; over the past four years some 200 companies and organisations made use of this opportunity , as well as over 100 members of the EUROSTEP distance-learning organisation . As the new technologies and services tested by these OLYMPUS users enter the commercial market , they then make use of operational satellites such as those of EUTELSAT . OLYMPUS utilisation will continue through 1993 and 1994 , when the spacecraft will run out of fuel as it approaches the end of its design life .

From : dnewcomb @ whale.st.usm.edu ( Donald R. Newcomb ) Subject : Re : Some more about gun control ... Nntp-Posting-Host : whale.st.usm.edu Organization : University of Southern Mississippi Lines : 145 First , I would like to say how much I appreciate having so literate and erudite an individual as Mr. Rutledge with whom to discuss this topic . Frankly , most anti-RKBA posters refuse even to approach the topic of the original understanding of the Bill of Rights as detailed in the writings of the era . This is most refreshing . Second , I must apologize for leaving the discussion for several days . My brigade 's quarterly drill was this weekend and I needed to attend to several matters pertaining to the State Militia . Some people seem to feel that the concept of the Militia is an anachro- nism that is out of place in the 20th century . I 'm not sure the Swiss would agree and I think perhaps a discussion of how the Militia , both organized and unorganized , fits into the defense plans of my State , Mississippi . Please do not assume that this describes something peculiar to one southern state . For instance , the Commonwealth of Massachusetts has a well organized Militia which , members report , maintains stocks of both riot guns and machine guns . The laws of other States will vary but are probably similar . Title 35 of Mississippi Code defines our Militia as `` all able-bodied citizens of the state between the ages of seventeen ( 17 ) and sixty- two ( 62 ) years ... '' . The Militia is divided into 3 classes : The National Guard , the Mississippi State Guard and the unorganized Militia . The National Guard is a strange sort of fish from a Constitutional perspective . It tries to be both State Militia and Federal Reserve . The discussion of this `` para-constitutional '' arrangement is quite interesting in itself but somewhat beyond the scope of this discussion . Suffice it that , at this date , the National Guard has ceased to have any Constitutional standing as anything but a Federal reserve force . Mississippi , and most other States , maintains a purely State organized Militia . In Mississippi this is called The State Guard . In other States it may be called something else . The State Guard exists as a cadre or training corps made up of mostly experienced officers and senior NCOs who serve as volunteers without compensation . We drill on a monthly basis at the company and battalion level , brigade once a quarter and have an annual drill of the whole organization . Our State-authorized cadre strength is 694 . This is a skeleton of an organization without any flesh . The muscle and sinew when needed will come from the unorganized Militia . In time of invasion , insurrection or calamity the Governor can order the activation of the State Guard . When this takes place a call will first be made for volunteers to fill the organization out to either its contingency strength of 2194 or full strength of 4910 . In the event that a sufficient number of people fail to volunteer , the law provides detailed instructions for the conducting of a draft of the unorganized Militia . The size of the State Guard is not specified by law , but rather by executive order . At one time , the organized Militia of Mississippi consisted of 68 regiments . Needless to say , the State does not have armories brimming with weapons with which to equip such a force . The historical precedent for arming such a force is by use of mostly the private arms of the Militiamen . It is my hope that demonstrates that State Militias are far from being the long dead anachronisms that some may wish to claim . > No , I simple stated that the people have a right to `` join a well > organized militia . '' And I have also stated that a militia that > meets once or twice a year is clearly `` well organized . '' And this > state of readiness that I have claimed the people have a `` right '' > to , is the same state of readiness expected of the militia as stated > by Hamilton . Regarding Hamilton : If you take Hamilton 's opinion as being the sole representative of the opinions of the Founding Fathers , you will have chosen a highly skewed sample set . Hamilton was on the extreme Federalist end of the political spectrum . Others , such as Coxe and Henry , can be chosen to represent the other end . Many contemporaries felt that the idea of having a standing Army of any sort or even a select Militia or `` train bands '' were contrary to the egalitarian nature of the govern- ment they were striving to perfect . The compromise reached was to provide for a small Army , which had to be refinanced every two years , and iron-clad protection for the Militia , which was to remain ever , '' terrible and irresistible '' . These protections included : State control , not Federal ; limitation of Federal utilization of the Militia ( i.e . execute Laws , suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions ) , and the Right to Keep and Bear Arms to prevent what the British had tried to do at Lexington . These limitations eventually proved so onerous to the Federal Govern- ment that they were skirted by the creation of the National Guard . The National Guard was created for one very simple reason : the Constitutional Militia was had proved too unreliable for fighting wars of imperial expansion . ( e.g . Spanish-American War ) . The Constitution provided that the Militia could only be employed by the Federal government in very limited purposes . As far back as the War of 1812 , Militia units had refused to leave United States territory to attack the enemy . Further , there was no Constitutional authorization for any conscription of anyone into the Federal Military and Militiamen were particularly protected . In all wars until WW-I every American who left the country under arms was a volunteer . When the National Guard acts of 1903-1916 required that each new member also enlist as a reservest in the Army , existing soldiers were '' grandfathered '' . At least one of these `` grandfathered '' individuals refused to go to France in 1918 and his refusal was upheld by the Federal Courts . Mr. Rutledge has stated that the Second Amendment applies only to members of a `` well organized '' militia . However , the pre-Constitutional history of the American Militia shows relatively few periods when The Militia came close to meeting either Messrs. Rutledge or Hamilton's definition of `` well organized '' . In the period of peace between the French & Indian War and The Revolution many companies simply stopped drilling and had to be reconstituted just prior to The Revolution . Perhaps Mr. Rutledge would care to argue that those of my ancestors who answered the Lexington alarm had forfeited their rights because their units did n't drill for a few years in the 1760s . I would not be so bold . Again , I wish to repeat . The National Guard , for all its merits , is not the Militia described by the Constitution nor by Mr. Hamilton nor by Mr. Henry nor by Mr. Coxe . The fact that the Federal Government and many States are delinquent in their attentions to and organizing of their Constitutional Militias diminishes neither their responsibilities nor the rights of the Militia as detailed in the Constitution . Misunderstanding of the nature and purpose of the Militia is but one error that has crept into modern readings of the Constitution . The Constitution prohibits States from keeping `` Troops or Ships of War in time of Peace '' . I have heard some insist this prevents States from maintaining a Militia , but this comes about because people today do not understand the meanings of the words in their 18th century usage . Today we call any large vessel a `` ship '' but in the 18th century the word described a particular kind of vessel . A `` ship '' is a large vessel with three or more masts each carrying square rigged sails . A `` brig '' has two masts . In the contemporary usage the States were prohibited only from keeping the largest warships of the day , those capable of global operations . Today's equivalent might be a prohibition on the States ' keeping nuclear missiles . `` Troops '' at this time meant a full-time professional military organization . Any study of contemporaneous writings will bear this out . In at least one respect , I am in agreement with Mr. Rutledge ; being personally involved in the maintenance and advancement of The Militia as a viable means of defense for a modern society , I am frequently both bemused and saddened when friends and associates wax poetic on their place in the unorganized Militia and become strangely silent or scarce when invited to attend a drill of their State 's Militia . -- Donald R.

PLPLOT is a scientific plotting package for many systems , small ( micro ) and large ( super ) alike . Despite its small size and quickness , it has enough power to satisfy most users , including : standard x-y plots , semilog plots , log-log plots , contour plots , 3D plots , mesh plots , bar charts and pie charts . Multiple graphs ( of the same or different sizes ) may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in each graph . Different line styles , widths and colors are supported . A virtually infinite number of distinct area fill patterns may be used . There are almost 1000 characters in the extended character set . This includes four different fonts , the Greek alphabet and a host of mathematical , musical , and other symbols . The fonts can be scaled to any size for various effects . Many different output device drivers are available ( system dependent ) , including a portable metafile format and renderer . The PLPLOT package is freely distributable , but NOT in the public domain . The PLPLOT source code , except header files and those files explicitly granting permission , may not be used in a commercial software package without consent of the authors . You are allowed and encouraged to include the PLPLOT object library and header files in a commercial package provided that : ( 1 ) it is explicitly and prominently stated that the PLPLOT library is freely available , and ( 2 ) the full copyrights on the PLPLOT package be displayed somewhere in the documentation for the package . We welcome suggestions on how to improve this code , especially in the form of user-contributed enhancements or bug fixes . If PLPLOT is used in any published papers , please include an acknowledgment or citation of our work , which will help us to continue improving PLPLOT . Also , please remember that as PLPLOT is not a commercial product , we can not be expected to offer the kind of support that a commercial product may . There is great interest in extending PLPLOT and fixing bugs , but the principal authors can only afford to work on it part time . Improvements will necessarily focus on those which help us get our work done . PLPLOT is written in C , enabling it to run on many platforms practically without modification . Fortran programs may use it transparently ; stub routines are provided to handle the C < - > Fortran interface without any modification of the user program . C programs are required to include the header file `` plplot.h '' ; see the documentation for more details . The main documentation for PLPLOT is in the doc/ directory in the form of several TeX files ; please consult this for additional information ( 'latex plotdoc ' ) .

Point me to documentation on power management so that I can write such an init . 3 . Explain to me why such an init is totally or partially impossible . Ideally , of course , I would like to be able to turn in on and off on the fly . Surely such an init would be very helpful to Powerbook owners who want to do MIDI ... I can not imagine why it is not possible to do , unless it requires Apple to divluge some secret . And if that is the case , the surely APPLE could write the init .

Yeah , there is absolutely no use for VLB except for video graphics . And no IDE could possibly take advantage the VLB , because it runs at 8 Mhz and 16 bits . Do people forget that the IDE was specifically designed to interface directly with the AT ISA bus ? We 've seen IDEs come out for EISA , XT ISA , and now even MCA , but at all times it was a 16 bit standard , running at somewhere near 8-10 Mhz . When you run an IDE off of the VLB , there 's no way that you 're running it at 33 Mhz , it would burn up . Of course same goes for SCSI , ESDI , whatever , none of them run at CPU speed . The only way to gain advantage with a VLB IDE is to hook it up to a caching controller . I suspect it would be much , much better to get a software disk cache instead , since you get write-caching as well . > because you have an ide and no one makes ide disks that big . I 've seen some Fuji IDE drives going as high as 1G . Yousuf Khan

( if you are familiar with Insight , you know the kit I mean ) . I believe the drive is either a Texel ( 265ms ) or an NEC ( 280ms ) , but it is not clear to me which one is actually a part of the bundle ( at least two of their sales people could n't give me a straight answer as to which one ; ah , yes , one of the drawbacks of OEM ! ) . Other questions : - Excuse my ignorance , but is `` Texel '' a reputable maker in the CD-ROM market ? Or do you think NEC is the better drive ? - Bottom line : Is this kit worth the money ? ( Currently , $ 449 for the TA-1000 , and $ 699 for the TA-2000 ) Alternatively , I was thinking that the TA-2000 might be overkill for my uses ( however , I *do* want full multimedia capabilities , Photo CD stuff , educational programs for my kids , etc . ) , and considered the lower-end TA-1000 kit and using the difference ( around $ 250.00 ) to get something else useful , like a tape back-up drive unit .

Well , I want my code to work on old systems too . I do n't know about sys 7.1 , but at least on 6.0.7 , there are bugs in the Sound Manager that causes channels to hang ( with no error message ) . This happends when I keep a channel open for long periods - necessary for performance - and play many sounds , stopping sounds halfway . Callbacks seems not to be reliable . Then only way I can safely tell if a sound has stopped playing is to inspect private variables in the channel ( QHead , I think it was ) , and the only way I have found to tell if a channel is hung is to inspect an *undocumented* flag and modify it .

I am thinking about buying an external monitor for my SE/30 and was wondering if anyone out in netland has any advice for me . I am mostly thinking about a 14 '' color monitor and an 8 bit card that can switch between 640*480 and something higher ( like 800*600 ) . I read an old report on a card from Lapis that could do this , but could not use the external monitor as the main screen ( with menubar ) which to me is a major draw- back . Has this perhaps been fixed ? Or can any other cards do this ( like the Micron Xceed ) ? Also which monitor should I buy ? At the moment I am leaning towards the Sony 1304 , 1304s or 1320 ( what exactly is the difference between these ? ) but are there any other good cheap monitors I should know about ? Does n't the monitor have to be multisync to support cards that can switch resolutions ? Please send me e-mail and I 'll summarize . I would also greatly appreciate getting the e-mail addresses of any mail order companys that sell monitors or cards . Thanks in advance Eggert Thorlacius University of Iceland

From : rats @ cbnewsc.cb.att.com ( Morris the Cat ) Subject : Vancouver/Seattle Study Critiques Organization : AT & T Distribution : usa Lines : 360 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Open letter by Dr. Paul H. Blackman , Research Coordinator for NRA-ILA . NRA Official Journal 1/89 . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Dear sir : By now , we are used to the New England Journal of Medicine 's publication of small-scale studies related to firearms from which conclusions are drawn which are quantum leaps from the data , followed by announcements of momentus `` scientific '' findings . These are regularly released to the press without the caveats which riddle the conclusory paragraphs , and often accompanied by an editorial calling attention to the findings . Generally , while they at least present a few interesting data , however meaningless , the studies misinterpret statistics , and ignore or belittle serious studies by criminologists . The latest effort -- `` Handgun Regulations , Crime , Assaults , and Homicide : A Tale of Two Cities , '' by J.H . Sloan , et al. , with the accompanying editorial , `` Firearms Injuries : A Call for Science , '' by two employees of the Centers for Disease Control ( November 10 ) , however , is an insult to the intelligence of any serious scholar in any field and have so few data and so many flaws that I feel compelled to write at some length to call attention to various major and minor failings , in no particular order . 1 . The authors misleadingly cite Wright , et al . ( Ref . 1 ) to support the statement that `` some have argued that restricting access to handguns could substantially reduce our annual rate of homicide . '' Wright , et al. , in fact studied and rejected that contention . 2 . The authors pretended that Vancouver and Seattle are very similar cities with similar economic circumstances , histories , demographic characteristics , and the like . In fact , the cities are very different with very different demographic characteristics which appear to explain completely the higher homicide rate in Seattle . Both cities are over three-forths non-Hispanic white and *the non-Hispanic white homicide rates are reported to be the same in Seattle and Vancouver* . It is the different back- grounds , problems , circumstances , and behaviors of the various ethnic minorities which explain the difference in homicide . 3 . The authors pretend they are evaluating Canada 's gun law , compared to Washington State 's . But they do not examine at all the situation in Vancouver prior to the gun law taking effect in 1978 . As it happens , in the three years prior to that ( 1975- 1977 ) , Vancouver averaged 23 homicides per year , one-eighth involving handguns , ( Ref . 2 ) and in the seven years of the NEJM article there were 29 homicides per year , one-eigth involving handguns . Surely even the medical profession recognizes that one must look to see the prior situation was before concluding that a change made a difference ? Would a physician conclude that a patient was benefiting from eating oat bran muffin each day for seven years because his cholesterol level was 200 without at least seeing if it was 180 before he started the regimen ? 4 . The authors pick two medium-sized cities to evaluate a national gun law . Nothing can be learned from such a tiny and arbitrarily selected sample . Seattle appears to have been selected because it was convienient for the authors rather than for any scientific reason . Would physicians call something a scientific study which involved one experimental subject and one dissimilar `` control '' ? Had different arbitrarily selected cities been chosen , opposite '' scientific '' conclusions would follow : Vancouver 's homicide rate *exceeds* that of such `` wild west '' cities in Texas as El Paso , Corpus Christi , Austen , and , in Colorado , Colorado Springs . ( Ref . 3 ) 5 . The authors fail to clearly demonstrate that firearms or handguns `` are far more commonly owned in Seattle than in Vancouver . '' They use two surrogate approaches in pretending to study the availability of firearms/handguns . The first is an apples-and-oranges effort to compare the number of carry permits in Seattle to the number of registered handguns in Vancouver . But the number clearly understates the number of handguns in Seattle , and counts primarily *protective* handgun owners . The second , however , tells nothing about the number of handguns in Vancouver , and counts *non-protective* handguns for the most part . Where is it difficult to obtain handguns legally for protection , registration figures are meaningless . There are 66,000 registered handguns in New York City ( New York Daily News , Sept. 27 , 1987 ) . Comparing the two , that method suggests about 930 handguns per 100,000 population in New York City compared to 960 in Vancouver , meaning Vancouver has a greater `` prevalence of weapons '' than New York City . The second method of measuring gun density is `` Cook 's gun prevalence index , a previously validated measure of intercity differences . '' But the validation was by Cook of his own theory . ( Ref . 4 ) Normally , second opinions are sought from a different doctor . More significantly , the Cook index is based on the average of the percentage of firearms involvement in suicide and homicide . So the authors are basically taking a measure of misuse . Unsurprisingly , gun misuse in homicide ( 42 % in Seattle , 14 % in Vancouver ) is related to gun misuse in homicide plus suicide , divided by two ( 41 % in Seattle , 12 % in Vancouver ) . The authors are not measuring the relative avail- ability of firearms , or of handguns , in Seattle and Vancouver . 6 . The authors misstate the laws of both Washington and Canada . They neglect to mention the significant fact that Washington has a waiting period and background check prior to the purchase of a handgun , and that provisions exist in Canadian law for owning and carrying handguns for personal protection . The authors also make it appear that it is more difficult to get a handgun legally in Canada than is actually the case . 7 . The authors ignore all other factors which might explain the differences in crime rate , beyond some vague mention of the penalities provided by law and the roughest of estimates of clearence for one particular offense -- homicide involving a firearm . There is no measure of : the differences in the number of law enforcement officers ; their aggressiveness in making arrests for gun law violations in the two jurisdictions ; arrest rates for other offenses ; conviction rates ; actual sentences imposed for gun-related crimes , violent crimes without guns , or gun law violations ; or incarceration rates . Whereas social scientists would attempt to measure and hold for such differences , the authors of the NEJM `` tale of two cities '' fail even to mention most factors related to crime control . 8 . The authors dismiss claims that handguns are an effective means for protection unless the criminal is killed . Such is not the case . Criminologists ( Ref . 5-8 ) have found that almost 650,000 Americans annually use handguns for protection from criminals , and that using a gun for protection reduces the liklihood that a crime -- rape , robbery , assault -- will be completed by the criminal and reduces the likelihood of injury to the victim . It is interesting , nonetheless , that the authors reported the same number ( four ) of civilian justifiable homicides without firearms in each city but that less restrictive Seattle accounted for 100 % of the reported civilian justifiable homicides involving firearms . 9 . The Centers for Disease Control , which funded the `` study , '' editorially praised the paper , ( Ref . 9 ) saying it `` applied scientific methods to examine a focus of contention betweeb advocates of stricter regulation of firearms , particularly handguns . '' There is nothing in the paper which could possibly be mistaken for `` scientific methods '' by a sociologists or criminologists . The Vancouver-Seattle `` study '' is the equivolent of testing an experimental drug to control hypertension by finding two ordinary-looking middle-class white males , one aged 25 and the other 40 , and without first taking their vital signs , administering the experimental drug to the 25-year-old while giving the 40-year-old a placebo , then taking their blood pressure and , on finding the younger man had a lower blood pressure , announcing in a `` special article '' a new medical breakthrough . It would be nice to think that such a `` study '' would neither be funded by the CDC or printed by the NEJM . Since the longstanding anti-gun biases of the NEJM and the CDC make them willing to present shoddy research as `` scientific breakthroughs '' in `` special articles '' and editorials relating to firearms , we are obligated to correct the record by notifying the news media and those with congressional and executive oversight over the activities of the Centers for Disease Control about the distortions contained in `` Handgun Regulations , Crime , Assaults , and Homicides : A Tale of Two Cities '' and `` Firearm Injuries : A Call for Science . '' Clearly , all scientific standards go by the wayside whenever the CDC and the New England Journal of Medicine seize an opportunity to attack firearms ownership in America . REFERENCES 1 .

Wright ( from July 1989 issue of REASON , Free Minds & Free Markets ) Someone once wrote : `` Statistics are like a bikini . What they real is suggestive , but what they conceal is vital . '' The problem is demonstrated by the most recent entry in a long line of scientific research purporting to show a causal link between gun availability and homicide . Funded by the federal government and published last year in the New England Journal of Medicine , the study compared homicide rates in Seattle and Vancouver and suggested that a handgun ban `` may reduce the rate of homicide in a community . '' The nine medical doctors who published `` Handgun Regulations , Crime , Assaults , and Homicide '' essentially reasoned in three steps : ( 1 ) Despite many historical , social , and demographic similarities , ( 2 ) Vancouver has a markedly lower homicide rate ( 3 ) because its stricter gun regulations make guns less available . The second step in their reasoning seems indisputable . The overall homicide rate in Seattle ( for the period 1980-86 ) was 11.3 per 100,000 popuation , compared with 6.9 in Vancouver . Homicide is definitely more common in Seattle . The question then becomes , Why ? The authors present a believable although not entirely accurate case to support the notion , as claimed in the third step of their reasoning , that Vancouver 's handgun regulations are much more stringent . But their evidence on the difference in gun *availabilty* is indirect and unpersuasive ; indeed , they acknowledge that direct evidence on the point does not exist . They offer two fragments of inferential data in support of the claim that guns are more available in Seattle ; but for all anybody knows as a matter of empirical fact , the opposite could be true . We are therefore being asked , at the conclusion of the study , to believe that a difference in gun availability explains the difference in homicide rates when a difference in gun availability has not itself been established . Indeed , the situation is even more troublesome . The first of the two indirect bits of evidence is a difference between the number of concealed- weapons permits issued in Seattle and the number of restricted-weapons permits issued in Vancouver . Differences between the two cities in the permit regulations render these two numbers strictly noncomparable . * The second bit of evidence is `` Cook 's gun prevalence index , '' which stands * at 41 percent for Seattle but only 12 percent for Vancouver . Cook 's index * however , does not measure the relative prevalence of gun ownership in * various cities . It measures gun misuse -- it is an average of the percentage * of homicides and suicides involving firearms . * In the present case , the index shows only that in homicides and suicides , * firearms are more likely to be used in Seatte than in Vancouver . To take * Cook 's index as a measure of general firearms availability , it must be * assumed that the proportional involvement of guns in homicides and suicides * is directly related to their relative availability in the general * population . But this is exactly what the authors are seeking to prove . To * assume what one is seeking to prove , then to `` prove '' it on the basis of * that assumption does ot constitute scientific evidence for anything . Even if we were to grant , on the basis of no compelling evidence , that guns are less common in Vancouver , we might still question what causes what . The authors attribute Seattle 's higher crime rate to a higher rate of gun ownership . But it might well be argued that low crime or homicide rates reduce the motivation for average citizens to obtain guns -- in other words , that crime rates explain the variation in gun ownership , not vice versa . In fact , it was once commonly argued that Great Britain 's low rate of violent crime was a function of that nation 's strict gun laws and the consequent low rate of gun ownership -- until British researcher Colin Greenwood found that Great Britain had enjoyed low rates of violent crime for many decades before strict firearms controls were enacted . To invoke an ancient methodological saw , correlation is not cause . Nor do the problems with this study end with its lack of direct data on gun ownership . The authors say Seattle and Vancouver are `` similar in many ways , '' implying that they differ mainly in gun availability , gun-law stringency , and crime rates . This is an evident attempt to establish the ceteris paribus condition of a sound scientific analysis -- that `` all else is equal '' among things being compared . * Clearly the two cities are similar in some ways , but a closer look * reveals differences in ways that are relevant to their respective crime * or homicide rates . The cities are closely matched in what percentage * of their population is white ( 79 percent and 76 percent ) . But Seattle * is about 10 percent black , while Vancouver is less than 0.5 percent . * Vancouver 's minority population is overwhelmingly Asian . So although the * authors show that th two cities are approximately comparable on a half- * dozen readily available demographic indicators , they have not shown * that all potentially relevant sources of variation have been ruled out . * In fact , the differences in racial compositions of the two cities is * particularly relevant in light of the study 's breakdown of homicide rates * according to the race of the victim . For the white majority , the homicide * rates are nearly identical -- 6.2 per 100,000 in Seattle , 6.4 in Vancouver . * The differing overall homicide rates in the two cities are therefore due * entirely to vastly different rates among racial minorities . For blacks , * the observed difference in homicide rate is 36.6 to 9.5 and for Hispanics * 26.9 to 7.9 . ( Methodoligical complexities render the Asian comparison * problematic , but it too is higher in Seattle than in Vancouver . ) Racial * minorities are much more likely to be the victims of homicide in Seattle * than in Vancouver ; the white majority is equally likely to be slain * in either city . Since the nearly 2:1 initial difference in homicide reates between the cities is due exclusively to 3:1 or 4:1 differences between minority groups , it is fair to ask why postulated difference in `` gun availability '' ( or gun-law strigency ) would matter so dramatically to minorities but not matter at all to whites . Can differential gun availability explain why blacks and Hispanics -- but not whites -- are so much more likely to be killed in Seattle than in Vancouver ? ( Studies in the United States , incidentally , do not show large or consistent racial differences in gun ownership . ) Or are other explanations more plausible ? Could the disparity between Canadian and American rates of poverty among racial minorities have anything to do with it ? What are the relative rates of drug or alcohol abuse ? Of homelessness among each cty 's minority population ? ( The city of Seattle runs the largest shelter for homeless men west of the Mississippi . ) Unemployment among young , central-city , nonwhite men in the United States usually exceeds 40 percent . What is the comparable Canadian percentage ? The crucial point is that Canada and the United States differ in many ways , as do cities and population subgroups with the two countries . Absent more detailed analysis , nearly any of these `` many ways '' might explain part or all of the difference in homicide rates . In gross comparisons such as those between Seattle and Vancouver , all else is *not* equal . * The authors of this study acknowledge that racial patterns in homicide * result in a `` complex picture . '' They do not acknowledge that the ensuing * complexities seriously undercut the main thrust of their argument . They * also acknowledge that `` socio-economic status is probably an important * confounding factor in our comparison , '' remarking further that `` blacks * in Vancouver had a slightly higher mean income in 1981 than the rest of * Vancouver 's population . '' Given the evidence presented in the article , * it is possible that all of the difference in homicide rates between Seattle * and Vancouver results from greater proverty among Seattle 's racial * minorities . But the authors pay no further attention to this possibility , * since `` detailed information about household incomes according to race * is not available for Vancouver . '' The largely insurmountable methodological difficulties confronted in gross comparative studies of this sort can be illustrated with as simple example . If one were to take all U.S. couties and compare them in terms of ( 1 ) pervalence of gun ownership and ( 2 ) crime or homicide rates , one would find an astonishing pattern : Counties with more guns have less crime . Would one conclude from this evidence alone that guns actually reduce crime ? Or would one insist that other variables also be taken into account ? In this example , the `` hidden variable '' is city size : Guns are more common in small towns and rural areas , whereas crime is a big-city problem . If researchers failed to anticipate this variable , or lacked the appropriate data to examine its possible consequences , they coud be very seriously misled . In the study at hand , the authors matched two cities for size but not for minority poverty rates or other hidden variables , and their results are impossible to interpret . In the editorial `` Firearm Injuries : A Call for Science '' accompanying the study , two officials from the Centers for Disease Control lauded the authors for applying `` scientific methods '' to a problem of grave public heath significance . But in attempting to draw causal conclusions from nonexperimental research , the essence of scientific method is to anticipate plausible alternative explanations for the results and try to rule them out . Absent such effort , the results may well seem scientific but are little more than polemics masquerading as serious research . That this study is but one of a number of recent efforts -- all employing practical identical research designs and published in leading scientific journals -- is cause for further concern .

The current feeling is that inflammation is not induced by food . There is even evidence that patients deprived of food have mucosal atrophy due to lack of stimulation of intestinal growth factors . There is now interest in providing small amounts of nasogastric feeding to patients on IV nutrition . But I digress .

Would that many patients be able to tell what causes them problems . The digestive processing idea is changing , but if a food causes problems , avoid them . Be sure that the foods are tested a second time to be sure the food is a real cause . Crohn's commonly causes intermittent symptoms and some patients end up with severly restricted diets that take months to renormalize . There was a good article in the CCFA newsletter recently that discussed the issue of dietary restriction of fiber . It would be worth reading to anyone with an interest in Crohn 's .

The concept of a closed canon would > certainly cast a shadow on contemporary prophets . On the other hand , > an open canon seems to be indicated sometimes . There are a lot of people running around saying `` God told me this '' and '' God told me that '' these days . Some people really have heard God , and others heard their glands . Mario Murrillo mentioned this in a sermon once . He said someone told him , `` The Lord gave me a song . '' He said that it was the worst song he had ever heard . `` I know why he gave you that song , '' Murillo said , `` He did n't want it anymore . '' But God does still speak to His people today , and the idea is contrary to the idea of a closed cannon . Ireneaus wrote about all the gifts of the Spirit in the church of His day ( 2nd and 3rd century ) and he was one of the first to put forth a New Testament cannon , which was almost identical to the one we have today . He believed in a closed cannon . Many prophets prophesied prophecies which were not recorded in the Scriptures . For example , one prophet in Kings , whose name starts with an `` M '' who prophecied that the king would lose a battle . That is the only prophecy he gave recorded in Scripture , and we no that he had given other prophecies because the king complained before he heard the prophecy , `` He never prophesies anything good about me . '' Yet only one little paragraph of all of his lifetime of prophecies are recorded in Scripture . There are numerous examples . Barnabas was a prophet , Acts says , before he was even sent out as an apostle . Yet his writings are not recorded in Scripture . Only two of Agabus prophecies are mentioned in Scripture . He was already a prophet before he gave them . So prophecy may be genuine and from God , but that does not make it Scripture . > Also interesting to note is that some so called prophecies are nothing new > but rather an inspired translation of scripture . Is it right to call > that prophecy ? Misleading ? Would n't that be more having to do with > knowledge ? I do n't know about translations of Scripture , but I am familiar with prophecies that give applications for Scripture . There are also similar examples in the Bible . Several times Peter interprets prophecies in a seemingly prophetic way , for example , `` And his bishoprick let another take '' concerning Judas office . A clearer example can be found in Matthew 24 . Jesus is prophesying about what will happen before His return and He quotes a passage out of Joel about the sun being darkened and the moon turning to blood . So Scriptural prophecy can be used in later prophecy . Sometimes this sort of thing can cross over into being a word of knowledge , but gifts of the Spirit seem to overlap . Words of knowledge and wisdom can overlap . The word of knowledge and prophecy can overlap . Interpretation of tounges is very similar to prophecy . Healings are often considered miracles . So sometimes the distinction between gifts is a bit hazy . Imho , it does n't usually matter that much if we are able to label a phenomenon , as long as we recognize them as the work of the Spirit , and use them according to His leading . Link Hudson .

This process is exactly analogous to having a private key which is NOT in a escrow system , and the state having to crack your cipher to get the data . Please do not use false analogies .

The claims that Jesus have been seen are discredited as extraordinary claims that do n't match their evidence .

I 've weathered attempted dog attacks before using the approved method : Slow down to screw up dog 's triangulation of target , then take off and laugh at the dog , now far behind you . This time , it did n't work because I did n't have time . Riding up the hill leading to my house , I encountered a liver-and-white Springer Spaniel ( no relation to the Springer Softail , or the Springer Spagthorpe , a close relation to the Spagthorpe Viking ) . Actually , the dog encountered me with intent to harm . But I digress : I was riding near the ( unpainted ) centerline of the roughly 30-foot wide road , doing between forty and sixty clicks ( 30 mph for the velocity-impaired ) . The dog shot at me from behind bushes on the left side of the road at an impossibly high speed . I later learned he had been accelerating from the front porch , about thirty feet away , heading down the very gently sloped approach to the side of the road . I saw the dog , and before you could say SIPDE , he was on me . Boom ! I took the dog in the left leg , and from the marks on the bike my leg was driven up the side of the bike with considerable force , making permanent marks on the plastic parts of the bike , and cracking one panel . I think I saw the dog spin around when I looked back , but my memory of this moment is hazy . I next turned around , and picked the most likely looking house . The apologetic woman explained that the dog was not seriously hurt ( cut mouth ) and hoped I was not hurt either . I could feel the pain in my shin , and expected a cool purple welt to form soon . Sadly , it has not . So I 'm left with a tender shin , and no cool battle scars ! Interestingly , the one thing that never happened was that the bike never moved off course . The not inconsiderable impact did not push the bike off course , nor did it cause me to put the bike out of control from some gut reaction to the sudden impact . Delayed pain may have helped me here , as I did n't feel a sudden sharp pain that I can remember . What worries me about the accident is this : I do n't think I could have prevented it except by traveling much slower than I was . This is not necessarily an unreasonable suggestion for a residential area , but I was riding around the speed limit . I worry about what would have happened if it had been a car instead of a dog , but I console myself with the thought that it would take a truly insane BDI cager to whip out of a blind driveway at 15-30 mph . For that matter , how many driveways are long enough for a car to hit 30 mph by the end ? I eagerly await comment .

From : libman @ hsc.usc.edu ( Marlena Libman ) Subject : Need advice with doctor-patient relationship problem Organization : University of Southern California , Los Angeles , CA Lines : 64 NNTP-Posting-Host : hsc.usc.edu I need advice with a situation which occurred between me and a physican which upset me . I saw this doctor for a problem with recurring pain . He suggested medication and a course of treatment , and told me that I need to call him 7 days after I begin the medication so that he may monitor its effectiveness , as well as my general health . I did exactly as he asked , and made the call ( reaching his secretary ) . I explained to her that I was following up at the doctor 's request , and that I was worried because the pain episodes were becoming more frequent and the medication did not seem effective . The doctor called me back , and his first words were , `` Whatever you want , you 'd better make it quick . I 'm very busy and do n't have time to chit- chat with you ! '' I told him I was simply following his instructions to call on the 7th day to status him , and that I was feeling worse . I then asked if perhaps there was a better time for us to talk when he had more time . He responded , `` Just spit it out now because no time is a good time . '' ( Said in a raised voice . ) I started to feel upset and tried to explain quickly what was going on with my condition but my nervousness interfered with my choice of words and I kind of stuttered and then said `` well , never mind '' and he said he 'll talk to various colleagues about other medications and he 'll call me some other time . This doctor called me that evening and said because I did n't express myself well , he was confused about what I wanted . At this point I was pretty upset and I told him ( in an amazingly polite voice considering how angry I felt ) that his earlier manner had hurt my feelings . He told me that he just does n't have time to `` rap with patients '' and thought that was what I wanted . I told him that to assume I was calling to '' rap '' was insulting , and said again that I was just following through on his orders . He responded that he resented the implication that he felt I was making that he was not interested in learning about what his patients have to say about their condition status . He then gave me this apology : `` I am sorry that there was a miscommunication and you mistakenly thought I was insulting . I am not trying to insult you but I am not that knowledgeable about pain , and I do n't have a lot of time to deal with that . '' He then told me to call him the next day for further instructions on how do deal with my pain and medication . I am still upset and have not yet called . My questions : ( 1 ) Should I continue to have this doctor manage my care ? ( 2 ) Since I am in pain off and on , I realize that this may cause me to be more anxietous so am I perhaps over-reacting or overly sensitive ? If this doctor refers me to his colleague who knows more about the type of pain I have , he still wants me to status him on my condition but now I am afraid to call him . -- Marlena

( Sorry all HP fans , but I have a hard time being convinced that their scopes match the rest of their ( excellent ) gear ) . One of the principal functions I look for when considering a DSO is whether you can turn interpolation off .

The only consolation is that manufacturers are _beginning_ to pay attention to ergonomics when designing the menus . However , to be fair , it seems that first time scope users ( our students ) seem to adjust to menus easier than navigating around the twenty or more knobs required of a `` real '' scope : - ) | > Last but not least , you never know if the waveform displayed is old | > or recent , noisy or just incoherently modulated , heck , you don't | > even know if it really looks the way it 's displayed .

I recently evaluated the latest box from Tek - their TDS320 - which seems to be a worthy alternative to a standard 100MHz analogue CRO . This instrument has a 100MHz , 500Ms/s spec , meaning that it is _always_ in real time capture mode . The pricing also matches equivalent analogue scopes in the range .

It 's supposedly a high-performance chip based upon workstation graphics accelerators . It 's quite fast ( I have 7 ) , but as usual with new boards/chips the drivers are buggy for Windows . As far as Winmarks go , it depends upon the version . I think I got 42M winmarks with version 3.11 . 2.5 yielded the 50+ number .

If we are > only talking about a single drive , explain why SCSI is inherently > faster at managing data from a hard drive . You are making the same mistake I did : you are confusing the DRIVE interface to the DATA THROUGHPUT interface . Again from my Mac & IBM info sheet { available by FTP on sumex-aim.stanford.edu ( 36.44.0.6 ) in the info-mac/report as mac-ibm-compare173.txt } : Expansion Both Mac & IBM SCSI : only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM . Allows the use of any device : hard drive , printer , scanner , Nubus card expansion { Mac Plus only } , some monitors , and CD-ROM . Apple developed some specifications for SCSI controlers while IBM has no exact controller specifications { which results in added incompatibilities on IBM machines } . Main problem : there are a lot of external devices which are internal terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port { A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and at the end . Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM } . SCSI-1 : 7 devices per SCSI controller . 8-bit asynchronous { ~1.5MB/s ave } and synchronous { 5MB/s max } transfer base . 16-bit SCSI-1 requires a SCSI-2 controler chip and can provide only fast SCSI-2 not wide SCSI-2 which are both 16-bit interfaces { see SCSI-2 } . SCSI-2 : 10 devices per SCSI controller in SCSI-2 mode . SCSI-2 is fully SCSI-1 complient and tends to be implimented as a very fast SCSI-1 since it needs a different controller interface in both hardware { which tends to be very expendsive } and software . Transfer speeds are 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst { 8-bit } , 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst { 16-bit } , and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst { 32-bit/wide and fast } . SCSI-2 in SCSI-1 mode is limited to 7 devices and reduced 8-bit or 16-bit { fast only } throughput due to the difference between SCSI-1 and wide SCSI-2 ports . IBM HD Interfaces { limited to hard drives by design or lack of development } : [ ... ] IDE : Integrated Device Electronics currently the most common standard , and is mainly used for medium sized drives . Can have more than one hard drive . Asynchronous Transfer : ~5MB/s max . So at its LOWEST setting SCSI-2 interface in Asynchronous SCSI-1 mode AVERAGES the through put MAXIMUM of IDE in asynchronous mode . In full SCSI-2 mode it blows poor IDE out the window , down the street , and into the garbage can . The problem becomes can the drive mechanisim keep up with those through put rates and THAT is where the bottleneck and cost of SCSI-2 comes from . NOT the interface itself but more and more from drive mechanisims to use the SCSI-2 through put . The cost of SCSI interface is a self fulliling prophisy : few people buy SCSI because it is so expencive for the PC , which in turn convices makes that mass producing SCSI { which would reduce its cost } is unwarented , and so SCSI is expencive . { That is the effect of the Rule of Scale : the more items sold the less EACH item has to bare the brunt the cost of manufacture and so the less each item has to cost } SCSI-2 allows a drive mechanisims through put to be limited by the DRIVE while IDE itself limits the through put .

I assume that the relevant resource is zSet , but I do not know , and I have no template for that resource . If you have a TMPL for the correct resource , I would be grateful to receive it . That way , I could play around a bit and maybe get my Duo to do something useful with its serial port . ( other than Appletalk ) . BTW , I believe that when the port stats says that maximum in buffer is 3074 bytes , that that means increasing the buffer will help , if you are using hardware handshaking . I can cram text data pretty fast into my Duo , and can monitor that CTS is being lowered , but the buffer never gets beyond 3074 ( out of 4096 ) bytes . Makes sense to me .

But > I digress ... ) I find that I am dissatisfied with the little purposes that we can manufacture for ourselves . Little in the cosmic sense . Even the greatest of the great pharos are long gone , the pyramids historical oddities being worn down by the wind , eventually to be turned into dust . Mankind itself will one day perish . Without some interconnectedness that transcends the physical , without God , it is all pointless in the end . Most people are able to live with that , and for them little purposes ( success , money , power , effecting change , helping others ) suffice . I suppose they never think about the cosmic scale , or are at least able to put it out of their minds . To me , it is comforting to know that reality is an illusion . That the true reality underneath the the physical is spirit . That this world is a school of sorts , where we learn and grow , and our souls mature . That gives a purpose to my little purposes , and takes some of the pressure off . It 's not so necessary to make this life a success in human terms if you 're really just here to learn . It 's more important to progress , grow , persist , to learn to love yourself and others and to express your love , especially when it 's dificult to do so . Honest effort is rewarded by God , he knows our limitations . > > I will live forever with God . > > Ah , now here we begin to diverge .

I have a feeling that most common perception of eternal life is WAY off base . If I were to be imprisoned in the limited ego/mind I am in now I doubt I would choose imortality . It would get awfully boring . TWO SERIOUS QUESTIONS/INVITATIONS TO DISCUSSION 1 . What is the nature of eternal life ? 2 . How can we as mortals locked into space time conceive of it ?

Please feel free to distribute this and my other messages on Clipper . The name of the encryption algorithm is `` Skipjack . '' Martin Hellman had written and the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part message which will then be encrypted under the system key SK producing E { E [ M ; K ] , E [ K ; UK ] , serial number ; SK } To which I responded : My understanding is that E [ M ; K ] is not encrypted under SK ( called the `` family key '' ) and that the decrypt key corresponding to SK is held by law enforcement . Does anyone have first hand knowledge on this ? I was correct in that E [ M ; K ] is not encrypted under SK . However , Skipjack being a single-key system , there is , of course , not a separate decrypt key for the family key SK . The unit key , also called the `` chip key , '' is generated from the serial number N as follows . Let N1 , N2 , and N3 be 64 bit blocks derived from N , and let S1 and S2 be two 80-bit seeds used as keys . Compute the 64-bit block R1 = E [ D [ E [ N1 ; S1 ] ; S2 ] ; S1 ] ( Note that this is like using the DES in triple encryption mode with two keys . ) Similarly compute blocks R2 and R3 starting with N2 and N3 . ( I 'm unlear about whether the keys S1 and S2 change . The fact that they 're called seeds suggests they might . ) Then R1 , R2 , and R3 are concatenated together giving 192 bits . The first 80 bits form K1 and the next 80 bits form K2 . The remaining bits are discarded . The seeds S1 and S2 do not change . The whole process is performed on a laptop computer , and S1 and S2 are supplied by two independent people so that no one person knows both . The same S1 and S2 are used during an entire `` programming session '' to generate keys for a stream of serial numbers . Everything is discarded at the end ( the computer could be thrown out if desired ) . The serial number is 30 bits and the values N1 , N2 , and N3 are formed by padding the serial number with fixed 34-bit blocks ( separate padding for each value ) . The resulting keys K1 and K2 are output onto separate floppy disks , paired up with their serial number . Each pair is stored in a separate file . The floppy disks are taken away by two separate people on behalf of the two escrow agencies .

All the villages from Trabzon to Erzincan and from Erzincan to Erzurum are destroyed . Corpses of Turks brutally and cruelly slain are everywhere . According to accounts by those who were able to save their lives by escaping to mountains , the first horrible and fearful events begun when the Russian forces evacuated the places which were then taken over by Armenian gangs . The Russians usually treated the people well , but the people feared the intervention of the Armenians . Once these places had been taken over by the Armenians , however , the massacres begun . They clearly announced their intention of clearing what they called the Armenian and Kurdish land from the Turks and thus , solve the nationality problem . Today I had the opportunity to meet Austrian and German soldiers who had escaped from Russian prison camps and come from Kars and Alexander Paul ( Gumru-Leninakan ) ... Russian officers tried to save the Turks and there were clashes between Russian officers and Armenian gangs . I am now in Erzurum , and what I see is terrible . Almost the whole city is destroyed .

If you look at any good book about thermophysics you 'll find a chapter about the `` CARNOT-process '' which describes how to get energy from a temperature difference ! And that is the reason for cooling towers too ! ! ! You only can get energy if you 've an temperature gradient . That means that you have steam on the one side and need to cool down the steam 'till you get water again on the other side if you want to get aprox . 30 % of the energy you ( or better the uranium ) brought into the water to let it boil . If you only have hot steam on the one and `` cold '' steam on the other side you 'll loose much more of the energy . And so they cool down the steam to get at least the 30 % of energy that carnot will give them . The cooling towers are for cooling the steam ! The vapor you 'll see is NOT the steam of the main core circulation , because that steam is radioactive ! The circulation is divided in AT LEAST 2 circuits connected about heat exchangers to prevent radioactive pollution of the environment ! -2nd . OK , the main core IS hot , but even in the modernst HighTemperature- Reactors ( HTR ) they only run at ~800 deg celsius . This is still verry far away from uraniums melting point which is somewhere around 2000 deg . celsius ! But you 'll have lot 's of problems with the boiler 's steel . That 's because at this temperature the metal is attacked by steam and will corrode verry fast . This is only for BWR 's . The new He cooled reactors have temperatures up to 1200 deg . celsius . But this is only experimental . -3rd . I personaly think that nuclear waste should be as low as ever possible because the dose you get will accumulate about the years . Today 1 mRem and next year 0.5 mRem wo n't be 0.75 mRem at all . It accumulates and even in 80 years you 'll still have 1.5 mRem .

You are extrapolating from the statement I made concerning a circumstance in which such an act of censorship would be permissable to the Teel case . If you had bothered to read the post instead of trying to prove how stupid you thought me you would have done rather better . The mode of argument I was using was a form of rhetoric . Argument by example , I describe a wide set of circumstances in which an action is permisable and demonstrate that they do not apply , thus the action is not permisable .

Numbers , please . That is irrelevant , the case is not the incremental cost but the facility cost . If I decide that a company I am associated with should subscribe to USEnet that usenet connection is the property of the company . It is quite legitimate for a company to have a political or other agenda and regulate the use of its property in accordance with its policy . For example if a Microsoft employee were to post `` Windows NT is crap do n't buy it '' from a Microsoft machine I would consider it reasonable for Microsoft to sack that employee . In the same way if a company decides that it has political objectives it might wish to regulate postings in a political manner .

The first ammendment certainly does not apply in this case as the numerous prosecutions of spies in the US proves . The crux of the Spycatcher affair was extrateritoriality of British law .

In actuality it is `` chorion '' , which is the last word Acts > 1:18 . Unfortunately my Greek dictionary does not discuss `` chorion '' so I > can not report as to the nuances of the word . I abhor publishing trash ( I abhor it of myself even more than I do from others , but since I do not present myself as an authority on the subject , I do not feel dishonest , though I do openly admit ignorance and incompetence in this example ) . Thus I felt honor bound to do a better set of research specifically on the word . First it should be noted that Greek grammar is not as tough as I first assumed ( it is not nontrivial by any means , and I still am not competent with it , but it is not as opaque as I had thought ) . It turns out that while the Index for the Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich `` Greek Lexicon '' renders each verse in order , each word within a verse is put in greek alphabetical order . Thus while the the meaning of the verse is decipherable , the syntax is far from clear . On the other hand , a Greek-English Intralinear Bible makes things a lot more comprehendable . And yes , the word for field in Acts 1:18 is indeed `` chorion . '' Now I 've checked several Greek-English lexicons : '' Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament , '' Louw and Nida '' Robinson 's Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament '' '' Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament , '' Grimm '' Word study Concordance , '' Tynsdale '' A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other early Christian Writings , '' Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich '' The New Analytical Greek Lexicon , '' Perschbacher In each case the meaning of the word Chorion was given variously as : A space , place , region , district , field , area , `` country place , '' land , farm , estate , `` a bit of tillage '' , and similar meanings . Nowhere do any of these books mention anything about `` grave . '' As some of these books go into great detail , I would be very surprised to find that these books are all inadequate and Mr Archer is the only competent scholar in Greek . I think it more likely that Mr Archer 's investigations into `` contradictions '' to be once again , as your friend said it , `` lacking in substance , '' and thus Archer is again shown worthless as an expert witness ( By the way Mr DeCenso , I would have honorably presented my results on this matter , even if I had found them to support Mr Archer 's contentions ) . By the way , among these lexicons , ( eg : Robinson 's ) is the definition of '' agros , '' the word used in Matthew 27 to describe the field bought . The word '' agros '' is defined as `` a field in the country . '' Chorion is specifically noted as a synonym to agros . This is significant , as it is evidence of how silly Bullinger 's exegisis was , which stated that the word for `` field '' in Matthew ( ie : agros ) is different from the word for `` field '' in Acts ( ie : chorion ) , and thus we must be talking about two different fields ( Of course you already admit how stupid Bullinger 's exegisis is , but this was a small serendipity which drives the point home ) . So as of now , unless Mr DeCenso show compelling reasons to believe otherwise ( eg : a reputable scholar with reputable references ) , I consider this particular issue closed . See Mr DeCenso , now you can go on to answer questions about the denials of Peter , the day of the Crucifixion , Tyre , and the fact that the author of Matthew quoted from the wrong prophet in discussing the `` Potter 's Field .

Reading newspapers to learn about this kind of stuff is not the best idea in the world . Newspaper reporters are notoriously ignorant on the subject of religion , and are prone to exaggeration in the interests of having a `` real '' story ( that is , a bigger headline ) . Let 's back up to 1935 . At this point , we have the Masoretic text , the various targums ( translations/commentaries in aramaic , etc . ) , and the Septuagint , the ancient greek translation . The Masoretic text is the standard Jewish text and essentially does not vary . In some places it has obvious corruptions , all of which are copied faithfully from copy to copy . These passages in the past were interpreted by reference to the targums and to the Septuagint . Now , the septuagint differs from the masoretic text in two particulars : first , it includes additional texts , and second , in some passages there are variant readings from the masoretic text ( in addition to `` fixing '' /predating the various corrupted passages ) . It must be emphasized that , to the best of my knowledge , these variations are only signifcant to bible scholars , and have little theological import . The dead sea scroll materials add to this an ancient *copy* of almost all of Isaiah and fragments of various sizes of almost all other OT books . There is also an abundance of other material , but as far as I know , there is no sign there of any hebrew antecdent to the apocrypha ( the extra texts in the septuagint ) . As far as analysis has proceeded , there are also variations between the DSS texts and the masoretic versions . These tend to reflect the septuagint , where the latter is n't obviously in error . Again , though , the differences ( thus far ) are not significant theologically . There is this big expectation that there are great theological surprises lurking in the material , but so far this has n't happened . The DSS *are* important because there is almost no textual tradition in the OT , unlike for the NT . -- C.

I must congratulate your analytical and excellent reportage about Diana . From the writings of tye biographers you quoted , I can perceive , maybe chauvinistically , the remnants of her Armenian genes . Even though she is only 1/64th Armenian , she seems to have many of the strong characteristics of Armenian women . Her Armenian ancestry is traced to Eliza Kewark ( an Armenian from India ) , who married the Scottish merchant Thedore Forbes . From the union was born Kathleen Scott Forbes , who married James Crombie from Aberdeen . They had a daughter Jane , who married David Littlejohn . Their daughter Ruth married William Gill . Ruth Silvia Gill , the grandmother of Lady Diana , married Lord Fermoy , and their daughter , Frances Ruth Burke Roache , married the eight Earl of Spencer , who was the father of Lady Diana . It is noteworthy that Eliza Kewark was also referred to as Mrs. Forbesian ( a characteristic Armenian surname ending ) . An Armenian-Scottish gene mix is dynamite . Levon K.

You have set up straw horses and knocked them down . I 'm not impressed . Anyway , the Armenians tore apart the Ottoman Empire 's eastern provinces , massacred 2.5 million defenseless Turkish women , children and elderly people , burned thousands of Turkish and Kurdish villages and exterminated the entire Turkish population of the Armenian dictatorship between 1914-1920 . Such outrageous sleight of hand that is still employed today in Armenia brings a depth and verification to the Turkish genocide that is hard to match . A hundred years ago Armenians again thought they could get whatever they wanted through sheer terror like the Russian anarchists that they accepted as role models . Several Armenian terror groups like ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle resorted to the same tactics in the 1980s , butchering scores of innocent Turks and their families in the United States and Europe . It seems that they are doing it again , at a different scale , in fascist x-Soviet Armenia today . Source : Stanford J.

'' ( London , Cambridge University Press 1977 ) . pp . 315-316 . `` In April 1915 Dashnaks from Russian Armenia organized a revolt in the city of Van , whose 33,789 Armenians comprised 42.3 percent of the population , closest to an Armenian majority of any city in the Empire ... Leaving Erivan on April 28 , 1915 , Armenian volunteers reached Van on May 14 and organized and carried out a general slaughter of the local Muslim population during the next two days while the small Ottoman garrison had to retreat to the southern side of the lake . '' `` Knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions , Armenians looked to Russia and Europe for the fulfillment of their aims . Armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the First World War with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse to serve their state , the Ottoman Empire , and to assist instead other invading Russian armies . Their hope was their participation in the Russian success would be rewarded with an independent Armenian state carved out of Ottoman territories . Armenian political leaders , army officers , and common soldiers began deserting in droves . '' `` With the Russian invasion of eastern Anatolia in 1914 at the beginning of World War I , the degree of Armenian collaboration with the Ottoman 's enemy increased drastically . Ottoman supply lines were cut by guerilla attacks , Armenian revolutionaries armed Armenian civil populations , who in turn massacred the Muslim population of the province of Van in anticipation of expected arrival of the invading Russian armies . '' Serdar Argic 'We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the Turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination . ' ( Ohanus Appressian - 1919 ) 'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists a single Turkish soul . ' ( Sahak Melkonian - 1920 )
From : bf3833 @ pyuxe.cc.bellcore.com ( feigenbaum , benjamin ) Subject : Clinton 's views on Jerusalem Organization : Bellcore , Livingston , NJ Lines : 15 I recently read that during Bill Clinton 's campaign , he stated that if elected he would immediately recognize Jerusalem as Israel 's capital . According to the article , Mr. Clinton reaffirmed this after winning the presidency . However , during recent talks with President Mubarak , Secretary of State Christopher stated that `` the status of Jerusalem will be a final matter of discussion between the parties '' . Now I do n't want to start a big discussion over the status of Jerusalem . All I want to know is if anyone can authenticate Mr. Clinton 's statements with dates , places , etc . Thank you . Ben .

I hope I am wrong . Ed should take a look at the budget deficit Regan and Bush created together before he starts to make claims about europe collapsing based on the budget deficits here . None of them are serious on the USA scale . And here in Europe we have zero interest in Ed-Ipser type freed thank you . We do not want our countries to be run by a narrow elite of rich lawyers for the benefit of the super wealthy . We are quite happy with social democracy and despite the fuss made in Time and Newsweek there is remarkably little being done to reverse the social welfare reforms brought in by socialism . The problem with socialism is that it started with the aims of free education and health care and provision of the welfare state . This has been achieved across the whole of Europe , only the USA is struggling to catch up .

What is happening in Italy is that the communist party has collapsed . This has meant that the grand coalition between right and left wing parties to keep out the communists has also collapsed . The magistrates have seized this opportunity to crack down hard on fraud and corruption and have arrested half the politicians . The fact that the socialists are in charge this week is incidental , the right is into the corruption just as baddly . What looks likely to happen is the fringe parties are going to do much better in the next election . Most of the parliamentary deputies are going to get replaced and the parties are going to be forced to look to people who are free of any hint of corruption . Look out for a parliament of Pavarotti 's and porn stars . Phill Hallam-Baker

It would be nice if , as you rightly point out the inherent value of freedom of speech , discussion would also deal with the all-to- frequent ritualized abuses and distortions of that freedom that do occur . There are situations where a few extremely vocal , and usually radical , people **do** drive people away , effectively stifle all other ( `` opposing '' ) views and generally `` take over '' . *Clearly* , the purpose behind such actions is *to deprive* others of *their* freedom of speech through overt and covert coercion and domination of the `` media form '' in question . While `` freedom '' of speech is to be valued , this is not . How would you suggest that this sort of reoccuring problem be alleviated ?

As I can find no Scripture ( have I missed it ? ) that details when you are married , I have to make some assumptions based on the PRINCIPLES of Scripture . It seems to me that it takes 3 parties to make a marriage : husband-to-be , wife-to-be , and God . If you promise before each other and God that you will convenant together to be married , then ... you are ( IMO ) . So why do we have the ceremonial part ? That seems to be there for `` connectedness '' in the Body of Christ . My brothers and sisters ought to be involved so that there can be some accountability on both our parts . That 's part of the concept from Hebrews about `` not forsaking the assembling of yourselves together as is the custom of some . '' We need each other because Lone Ranger Christians and Lone Ranger Marriages smack of a self sufficiency that the I do n't see in the NT . Does anyone see the Paul Simon `` I am a rock , I am an island ... '' model anywhere in Christianity . ( Song lyrics show your age : - ) ) ? Further , since marriage is a legal matter/institution in the USA and many other places , and such laws do not specifically go crosswise to the clear teachings of Scripture , we ought to obey them to avoid even the appearance of `` evil '' ( I Thess 5:22 ) So this would imply at least a civil ceremony before marriage , but keep in mind we are at least doing all of this for the conscience of others because back to the beginning ... you are married when you and your intended promise each other and God to be in convenant . ( IMO ) What ch'all think ? Bobby - akgua ! rjb [ In some states , the kind of commitment described in Richard Szanto's posting can create a common law marriage . Indeed his posting itself might go a long way towards establishing that a marriage exists , should the issue ever end up in court . He might want to consult a lawyer who is familiar with common law marriage in his state . -- clh ]
From : db7n+ @ andrew.cmu.edu ( D. Andrew Byler ) Subject : Re : What WAS the immaculate conception Organization : Freshman , Civil Engineering , Carnegie Mellon , Pittsburgh , PA Lines : 48 Biblical basis for the Immaculate Conception : 1 ) `` I will put enmity between you [ the Serpent ] and the woman , and between your seed and her seed , she [ can also be read he ] shall crush your head and you shall bruise her [ or his ] heel . '' -Genesis 3.15 2 ) `` He who commits sin is of the devil ... '' -1 John 3.8 3 ) `` Hail , full of grace [ greek - kecharitomene ] , the Lord is with thee ... '' -Luke 1.28 From the above , we prove the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception . First , God has given the proto-evangel in Genesis 3.15 , which is the first promise of a savior , who will redeem mankind from the wiles of Satan . `` [ Satan ] was a murderer from the beginning , and has not stood in the truth because there is no truth in him . '' John 8.44 . Now the proto-evangel promises several things , enmity between Satan and `` the woman '' , and enmity between Satan and `` her seed . '' Now the woman is both Eve ( who is the immediate point of reference ) and Mary , the second Eve . `` Her seed '' is Jesus Christ , and He is also at enmity with Satan in the same way as Mary is said to be at enmity with Satan . Thus , knowing as we do that Jesus Christ is sinless ( Hebrews 7.26 ) , we can conclude that Mary is also sinless because if she was n't she would 1 ) not be at enmity with the devil , as 1 John 3.8 tells us , and 2 ) the relation of her sinlessness to Christ 's sinlessness would be called into question , as would God 's veracity . For God promised an enmity between Mary and the serpent , and it is not possible for God to lie or be decieved . Second , we have the Angelic Greeting where Mary is called by the Archangle Gabriel `` full of grace . '' As I pointed out above this is from the Greek word `` Kecharitomene '' which means not just full of grace , but a plenitude or perfection of grace . The sense of it is best grasped by the footnote to the Jerusalem Bible , `` Hail you who have been and reamin filled with grace . '' But that is a little to long to say , so it is reduced to full of grace . And as it says , `` you who have been '' Mary had always been filled with grace , from the moment of her conception , which was also the moment of her salvation , until her death some years later . It must be admitted that it is possible that God could have done what the doctrine of the Immaclute Conception says He did do . And if God could keep himself free from any contact with sin , through his Mother , He would have , and the Bible records this fact , to which the Fathers of the Church such as St. John Damascus , St. Augustine of Hippo , St. Ambrose and others are in complete agreement with , as is all of Christian tradition , and as is the infallible declaration of the Pope on the matter in `` Ineffibilus Deus .

Zionism agrees with the basic tenet of anti-Semitism , namely that Jews can not live with non- Jews . The history and roots of the Holocaust go back a long way . While the industru of death and destruction did not operate before 1942 , its roots were firmly placed in the 19th Century . Jewish aspirations for emancipation emerged out of the national struggles in Europe . When the hopes for liberation through bourgeois-democratic change were dashed , other alternatives for improving the lot of the Jews of Europe achieved prominence . The socialist Bund , a mass movement with enormous following , had to contend with opposition from a new and small , almost insignificant opponent , the political Zionists . In outline these two offered diametrically opposed options for Jews in Europe . While the Bund was suggesting joining forces with the rest of Europe 's workers , the Zionists were proposing a new programme aimed at ridding Europe of its Jews by setting up some form of a Jewish state . Historically , nothing is inevitable , all depends on the balance of forces involved in the struggle . History can be seen as an option tree : every time a certain option is chosen , other routes become barred . Because of that choice , movement backwards to the point before that choice was made is impossible . While Zionism as an option was taken by many young Jews , it remained a minority position until the first days of the 3rd Reich . The Zionist Federation of Germany ( ZVfD ) , an organisation representing a tiny minority of German Jews , was selected by the Nazis as the body to represent the Jews of the Reich . Its was the only flag of an interantional organisation allowed to fly in Berlin , and this was the only international organisation allowed to operate during this period . From a marginal position , the leaders of the Zionist Federation were propelled to a prominence and centrality that surprised even them . All of a sudden they attained political power , power based not on representation , but from being selected as the choice of the Nazi regime for dealing with the the 'Jewish problem ' . Their position in negotiating with the Nazis agreements that affected the lives of many tens of thousands of the Jews in Germany transformed them from a utopian , marginal organisation in Germany ( and some other countries in Europe ) into a real option to be considered by German Jews . The best example of this was the 'Transfer Agreement ' of 1934 . Immediately after the Nazi takeover in 1933 , Jews all over the world supported or were organising a world wide boycott of German goods . This campaign hurt the Nazi regime and the German authorities searched frantically for a way disabling the boycott . It was clear that if Jews and Jewish organisations were to pull out , the campaign would collapse . This problem was solved by the ZVfD . A letter sent to the Nazi party as early as 21 . June 1933 , outlined the degree of agreement that existed between the two organisations on the question of race , nation , and the nature of the 'Jewish problem ' , and it offered to collaborate with the new regime : '' The realisation of Zionism could only be hurt by resentment of Jews abroad against the German development . Boycott propaganda - such as is currently being carried out against Germany in many ways - is in essence unZionist , because Zionism wants not to do battle but to convince and build . '' In their eagerness to gain credence and the backing of the new regime , the Zionist organisation managed to undermine the boycott . The main public act was the signature of the `` Transfer Agreement '' with the Nazi authorities during the Zionist Congress of 1934 . In essence , the agreement was designed to get Germany 's Jews out of the country and into Mandate Palestine . It provided a possibility for Jews to take a sizeable part of their property out of the country , through a transfer of German goods to Palestine . This right was denied to Jews leaving to any other destination . The Zionist organisation was the acting agent , through its financial organisations . This agreement operated on a number of fronts - 'helping ' Jews to leave the country , breaking the ring of the boycott , exporting German goods in large quantities to Palestine , and last but not least , enabling the regime to be seen as humane and reasonable even towards its avowed enemies , the Jews . After all , they argued , the Jews do not belong in Europe and now the Jews come and agree with them . After news of the agreement broke , the boycott was doomed . If the Zionist Organization found it possible and necessary to deal with the Nazis , and import their goods , who could argue for a boycott ? This was not the first time that the interests of both movements were presented to the German public as complementary . Baron Von Mildenstein , the first head of the Jewish Department of the SS , later followed by Eichmann , was invited to travel to Palestine . This he did in early 1933 , in the company of a Zionist leader , Kurt Tuchler . Having spent six months in Palestine , he wrote a series of favourable articles in Der STURMER describing the 'new Jew ' of Zionism , a Jew Nazis could accept and understand . This little-known episode established quite clearly the relationship during the early days of Nazism , between the new regime and the ZVfD , a relationship that was echoed later in a number of key instances , even after the nature of the Final Solution became clear . In many cases this meant a silencing of reports about the horrors of the exterminations . A book concentrating on this aspect of the Zionist reaction to the Holocaust is Post-Ugandan Zionism in the Crucible of the Holocaust , by S. B. Beth-Zvi . In the case of the Kastner episode , around which Jim Allen 's play PERDITION is based , even the normal excuse of lack of knowledge of the real nature of events does not exist . It occured near the end of the war . The USSR had advanced almost up to Germany . Italy and the African bases had been lost . The Nazis were on the run , with a number of key countries , such as Rumania , leaving the Axis . A second front was a matter of months away , as the western Allies prepared their forces . In the midst of all this we find Eichmann , the master bureaucrat of industrial murder , setting up his HZ in occupied Budapest , after the German takeover of the country in April 1944 . His first act was to have a conference with the Jewish leadership , and to appoint Zionist Federation members , headed by Kastner as the agent and clearing house for all Jews and their relationship with the SS and the Nazr authorities . Why they did this is not difficult to see . As opposed to Poland , where its three and a half million Jews lived in ghettoes and were visibly different from the rest of the Polish population , the Hungarian Jews were an integrated part of the community . The middle class was mainly Jewish , the Jews were mainly middle-class . They enjoyed freedom of travel , served in the Hungarian ( fascist ) army in fronline units , as officers and soldiers , their names were Hungarian - how was Eichmann to find them if they were to be exterminated ? The task was not easy , there were a million Jews in Hungary , most of them resident , the rest being refugees from other countries . Many had heard about the fate of Jews elsewhere , and were unlikely to believe any statements by Nazi officials . Like elsewhere , the only people who had the information and the ear of the frightened Jewish population were the Judenrat . In this case the Judenrat comprsied mainly the Zionist Federation members . Without their help the SS , with 19 officers and less than 90 men , plus a few hundred Hungarian police , could not have collected and controlled a million Jews , when they did not even know their whereabouts . Kastner and the others were left under no illusions . Eichmann told Joel Brand , one of the members of Kastner's committee , that he intended to send all Hungary 's Jews to Auschwitz , before he even started the expulsions ! He told them clearly that all these Jews will die , 12,000 a day , unless certain conditions were met . The Committee faced a simple choice - to tell the Jews of Hungary about their fate , ( with neutral Rumania , where many could escape , being in most cases a few hours away ) or to collaborate with the Nazis by assisting in the concentration process . What would not have been believed when coming from the SS , sounded quite plausible when coming from the mouths of the Zionist leadership . Thus it is , that most of the Hungarian Jews went quietly to their death , assured by their leadership that they were to be sent to work camps . To be sure , there are thirty pieces of silver in this narrative of destruction : the trains of 'prominents ' which Eichmann promised to Kastner - a promise he kept to the last detail . For Eichmann it was a bargain : allowing 1,680 Jews to survive , as the price paid for the silent collaboration over the death of almost a million Jews . There was no way in which the Jews of Hungary could even be located , not to say murdered , without the full collaboration of Kastner and his few friends . No doubt the SS would hunt a few Jews here and there , but the scale of the operation would have been miniscule compared to the half million who died in Auschwitz . It is important to realise that Kastner was not an aberration , like say Rumkovsky in Lodz . Kastner acted as a result of his strongly held Zionist convictions . His actions were a logical outcome of earlier positions . This is instanced when he exposed to the Gestapo the existence of a British cell of saboteurs , Palgi and Senesh , and persuaded them to give themselves up , so as not to disrupt his operations . At no point during his trial or elsewhere , did Kastner deny that he knew exactly what was to happen to those Jews . To conclude , the role played by Zionists in this period , was connected to another role they could , and should have played , that of alarming the whole world to what was happening in Europe . They had the information , but politically it was contrary to their priorities . The priorities were , and still are , quite simple : All that furthers the Zionist enterprise in Palestine is followed , whatever the price . The lives of individuals , Jews and non-Jews , are secondary . If this process requires dealing with fascists , Nazis and other assorted dictatorial regimes across the world , so be it .

Cute analogy . The U.S. does n't treat drunk driving like a serious crime . However , we also do n't confiscate cars of people who drink . We also do n't confiscate *all* cars because some people drink and drive .

The Catholic church ? > Hate to step on toes . > thanks An interesting interpretation of Revelation 17 and 18 has been given by evangelist David Wilkerson . I am not saying that I totally agree with his interpretation , but it is certainly believable and good food for thought . He interprets the Babylon of Revelation 17-18 as being none other than the good old U. S. of A . That 's right , America . He supports his claim in several ways . The Babylon of Revelation is THE world leader in trade and commerce , and the WHOLE WORLD wept when Babylon fell . The American dollar , despite the Japanese success of the 20th century , is STILL the most sought after currency in the world . If the U.S. were destroyed , would n't the whole world mourn ? The bible also talks about Babylon being a home of harlots , sin , and adultery ( I am paraphrasing , of course ) . Babylon 's sin affected , or should I say , infected , the whole world . It does n't take much looking to see that the U.S. is in a state of moral decay . Has n't the American culture and Hollywood spread the `` do it if it feels good '' mentality all over the world . I think , though , that what Mr. Wilkerson uses as his strongest argument is the fact that Revelation calls Babylon `` Babylon the Great '' and portrays it as the most powerful nation on earth . No matter how dissatisfied you are with the state of our country , I do n't think you would have too much trouble agreeing that the U.S. is STILL the most powerful nation on earth . Again , this interpretation is not NECESSARILY my own , but I do find it worthy of consideration . Jeffrey Little

I 've called the apple hotline ( 800 SOS-APPL ) three times already and finally they agreed something is astray after my Duo 's screen would go dim and the hard drive spun down by itselft and put itself to sleep .

I asked for the same coverage and same deductibles . Most of the companies charge you according to your zip code . Others charge according to your city . Anyhow , I gave the same zip code and city to all three places . Here's what I found ( for a '93 Integra GS ) : AAA : ~ $ 2000/yr . State Farm : 2614.92/yr . Allstate : 1220/yr . AAA is non-profit , so they said I could also expect to receive about $ 200-300 back at the end of the year . Still , There is a huge gap between all of these companies .

I have ( had ) several problems with the card . - Applications crashed when moving the mouse ( VGA mode ) . Fixed by removing the line STACKS=0,0 from config.sys . The default value STACKS=9,256 does just fine . - Random white pixels all over the screen when moving the mouse , in a 256 color graphical mode ( the hardware cursor modes ) . Fixed by turning off the hardware scroll ( `` 24xmode scrolloff '' ) before entering the graphics mode . This also fixed the problem of the windowed DOS boxes under windows . With the hardware scroll enabled , applications write garbage outside the window . - The screensavers do not remove the cursor in 256 color modes ( hardware cursor ) . I do n't know if this is a windows problem or a driver problem . Clearly there should be two types of cursor removing functions : a remove- for-draw , which can be ignored for hardware cursors and a remove- unconditionally . Do other cards with hardware cursors have the same problem ? - The VESA driver does not support the 640x480x16M TrueColor mode .

One book I have which presents a fairly unbiased account of many religions is called _Man 's Religions_ by John B. Noss . It was a textbook in a class I had on comparative religion or some such thing . It has some decent bibliographies on each chapter as a jumping off point for further reading . It does n't `` compare '' religions directly but describes each one individually and notes a few similarities . But nothing I have read in it could be even remotely described as preachy or Christian based . In fact , Christianity mercifully consumes only 90 or so of its nearly 600 pages . The book is divided according to major regions of the world where the biggies began ( India , East Asia , Near East ) . There is nothing about New World religions from the Aztecs , Mayas , Incas , etc . Just the stuff people kill each other over nowadays . And a few of the older religions snuffed out along the way . If you like the old stuff , then a couple of books called `` The Ancient Near East '' by James B. Pritchard are pretty cool . Got the Epic of Gilgamesh , Code of Hammurabi , all the stuff from way back when men were gods and gods were men . Essential reading for anyone who wishes to make up their own religion and make it sound real good .

Again , not true . The characters in a TT or Type 1 font depend on the maker . If someone converts a Type 1 font to TT they 'll only get the characters in the font of orgin . TT allows for much more flexibility in this area as well . You can have thousands of glyphs in a TT font file ( Mac/PS/Windows/Unicode char set ) and use the characters appropriate for the particular platform you are running the font on . Well , yes , both Type 1 and TrueType fonts can contain lots of characters . And in both cases plain text fonts will be reencoded to Windows ANSI in Windows , and to Mac standard roman encoding on the Mac . No difference there between T1 and TT ! And as for fonts with thousands of glyphs , right know these are a liabiliaty rather than a great new thing . Reason is that a font with 3000 characters is very large , and if you can only access 224 of them you are paying a heavy price in downloading time and printer storage . ( And at the moment there is only one program of that uses ` partial font downloading ' ) For instance , all or our fontpack 2 TT fonts have the Mac/Windows char set in them . The metrics of the fonts are such that if the font is brought over to the mac the user will have access to the full mac char set . Yes and T1 text fonts all have the ` ISO Adobe ' character set , which is a superset of Windows ANSI and Macintosh standard roman enocding . The question is whether you can get at the glyphs . In Windows , for example , you can not get at the ligatures ` fi ' anfd ` fl ' ( both T1 and TT ) even though a font may very well have them . ANd , while it is somewhat painful to reencode a Type 1 font and to create a new Windows metric file ( PFM ) for it , there are utilities out there to allow you do this . How do I reencode a TrueType font ? How can I get at the ` fi ' and ` fl ' ligatures in Windows ( or on the Mac ) ?

I found out why later on when I tried to get a repair done at an Apple registered repair center - the CPU was a resale . The serial number had been removed and replaced with a non-standard number ( probably from CDA computers ) . Consequently , the Apple repair man could not do ANY warrenty repairs . So I ended up with just a 90day warrenty from CDA over the Apple 12month warrenty . Boy , was I pi**ed ! Moral of the story , CAVEAT EMPTOR .

THe digital side ? TTL ? ECL ? We run 200MHz and 100MHz all over our IC test equipment all day long in the ECL domain , and we use DIP 's along with PLCC 's , 25mil and 20mil pitch 256pin QFP 's to name a few . I do n't see a problem in packaging as long as you adhere to sound engineering practices . A good source of information is Motorola 's MECL System Design Handbook . The latest ed . is dated 2/88 . That is considered to be one of the *bibles* in high-speed design . The very fact that you need to build a test fixture means you 're most likely going to need a socket . It in itself has far more inductance per pin than the package you are testing , not to mention any impedance discontinuities . I do n't see the big concern over the packaging because it probably is n't going to make that much difference If you 're trying to get TTL to run at 100MHz , have fun ... TTL was never designed to run in a 100MHz environment . : - ( aaron P.S . My opinions have nothing to do with my company ... the standard disclaimer applies .

I grew up catholic . Up until I was 14 , it was n't an issue for me . Then I met a born-again christian , a very sweet person , not proseletyzing ( sp ? ) , not imposing . I tried to get into being as christian as I could , as I felt I 'should ' . But the more I tried , the more depressed I got . I felt guilty for some of my own personal , honest feelings . I tried so hard to reconcile this conflict . until I was 23 . Then I taught myself to think rationally . I read a lot of books , pro and con religion in general and , specifically , catholicism . I came to a crisis point , then it finally clicked and now I am a staunch atheist . This is a very loose explanation , but it 's the gist of it . Now , ( at 26 ) I feel better about myself , better self-esteem , a generally stronger person . I have well-defined goals . I have a strong and stable sense of morals and values . I am not a neo-nazi or a corrupt politicain , etc . I believe in human rights and 'live and let live ' among other things . I am very anti-violent and anti-hatred . ( This is to debunk the myth that atheists are depraved . ) Religion has no place in my system . Tough . Bertrand Russell said that we can not *know* god does n't exist , we ca n't prove it . So , in that sense , we can only truly be agnostic . But , for all practical purposes there is no god . Thanqs ken engel kene @ acs.bu.edu

Like any other strong crypto software , it 's not exportable legally . It can be modified with permission from RSADSI , which a number of people have received in the past . ) For reasons that aren't entirely clear to me , RSA says that only U.S. people should take RSAREF from its server , although there are n't ITAR issues regarding Canada .

From : grady @ netcom.com ( 1016/2EF221 ) Subject : powerful `` similarity '' too Organization : capriccioso X-Newsreader : TIN [ version 1.1 PL6 ] Lines : 107 A Unix tool of cryptographic significance is available for anonymous ftp . `` agrep 2.0.4 '' -- a fast approximate pattern-matching tool source code project available from : cs.arizona.edu in directory `` agrep '' agrep is a very fast fuzzy search tool with a tremendous number of powerful search options . The one most obviously applicable to cryptography ( key selection ) is to be able to specify the `` similarity '' of matches in the data . For example say you make up a password/phrase of `` qimwe7l '' . Of course you rightly suspect that this key itself is not in any dictionary or word list . But how *close* is it to en entry that could be varied by some `` crack '' program to brute-force search for it ? You use agrep to find out . Looking with argument for none , one or two errors , no matches . Good so far . But agrep -3 `` qimwe7l '' bigwordandphraselist finds that the pattern `` qimwe7l '' is too close to the pattern `` imsel '' ( part of `` himself '' and a host of others ) , to be of any cryptographic value as a key . An error of level two corresponds to a simple transposition of letters like `` teh '' for `` the '' . A minimally acceptable password would have to pass as *least* level 3 in order not immediately ruled-out as even a remote possibility of being a good password . ( In real cryptographic use , my personal passphrases clear at *least* level 8 on my rather large [ > 80 meg ] word and phrase lists . ) And for searching for key words in human-typed data ( lots o' typos ) the tool is unexcelled . For example , For example , say I want to find out what people think about Gibson's SF book `` Neuromancer '' in the huge SF-Lover 's archives . Even with an error distance specification as small as of `` 1 '' I will find all those people who think the title was `` Necromancer '' or other common typos . Why miss anything ? Also , the program can look for up to 30,000 patterns IN PARALLEL at Boyer-Moore ( sublinear ) speeds . Great for a NSA wannabe to look for your name , terrorists names , special Tagalog or religious words , etc . in the news or e-mail spool directories . You can even search for ciphertext by using , say , 30,000 random three-byte combinations and eliminate all texts that do n't score the X chi-square 'birthday ' hits on message size Y . You think some crypto-terrorist is try to foil you by changing the pattern on you ? No problem . Try agrep -p NSA to find NSA , National Security Agency , NSecAg , No Such Agency , National Scrabble Association , N*S*A , etc . You can also specify `` fixed '' areas : looking for license plate XYZ123 when you know that the letters are correct , you might say : agrep -2 < XYZ > 123 licenseplatedatabase will find all plates starting with XYZ with up to two errors ( addition , substitution , deletion ) in the number area . You can also `` weight '' the relative `` cost '' for substiutions , additions , or deletion errors . For example , when searching DNA patterns for a particular protein combination , you might know that some kinds of damage cause the `` A '' nucelotide to drop out more than other errors ... you could adjust for this bias by setting -Dc where you set the `` deletion cost '' to count as `` c '' errors . A steganographic use ( I even used `` agrep -2 `` < steg > eograp '' E '' just now to find the correct spelling ! ) would be to intentionally introduce errors of a certain type and magnitude into a plaintext and then later recover the orginal it via an agrep pipe . Lots of possibilities here when only outlaws can have ciphertext ... Also with agrep 's powerful extraction options it makes it easy to abstract the `` hits '' into a useful form . For example , agrep -d `` ^From '' 'PGP ; ( passphrase|Zimmerman|NSA ) ' says output the entire mail record , delimited by 'From' that contains 'PGP ' and contains either 'passphrase ' , 'Zimmerman ' , or 'NSA ' . And agrep has been measured an order-of-magnitude faster than the second-best similarity tool publicly available . As usual , I will be glad to e-mail the source and docs to those who reqest them by e-mail IF they can not do an anonymous FTP . Get this now . It is too powerful to stay in the hands of the NSA .

Your logic certainly applies to standard investment strategies . However , the concept of a prize for a difficult goal is done for different reasons , I suspect . I 'm not aware that Mr Orteig received any significant economic benefit from Lindbergh 's flight . Modern analogies , such as the prize for a human powered helicopter face similar arguments . There is little economic benefit in such a thing . The advantage comes in the new approaches developed and the fact that a prize will frequently generate far more work than the equivalent amount of direct investment would . A person who puts up $ X billion for a moon base is much more likely to do it because they want to see it done than because they expect to make money off the deal . -- Josh Hopkins jbh55289 @ uxa.cso.uiuc.edu `` Find a way or make one .

From : maridai @ comm.mot.com ( Marida Ignacio ) Subject : Re : Every Lent He suffers to save us Organization : trunking_fixed Lines : 59 The story I related is one of the seven apparitions approved by our Church as worthy of belief . It happened in La Salle , France . The moral lesson of the story is : The Lamb of God has been sacrificed and His blood has been used to cleanse us of our sins every moment as God perceives worthy of being done in Heaven . Mary weeps for The Lamb and for the rest of her offsprings . This will continue while we disobey God or sin against Him . Mary , as a messenger , has been given the task to make us be 'aware ' of the evil serpent ( communism , wars , famine , unfaithful , disobedience to God , etc . ) running after the rest of her offsprings . The children who went astray by disobedience led by the dragon is brought back by her peace and loving messages , reparations for sins , to obey God 's commandments and be more worthy to be in the presence of The Lamb . As she was conceived without sin to be worthy of bearing the Son of God in her womb , Mary has been preparing us , the Church , the Body of Christ , for His second coming ( making sure we are protected from the dragon ) . Also , she has been preparing the new Eden , by reversing the deed of the ancient Eve . The new Eden will be the sanctuary of the righteous as judged by Christ in His next coming . I relate the story again : I believe this and Mary , in one of her apparitions in 19th or 20th century , she appeared to these two children who tends goats and cows ( I forgot the exact place ) . She was weeping and telling the children that she is afraid she 's `` going to lose her Son 's arm '' . She is mourning too for these townfolks because it was their fault that there would be drought in their harvest ; not much good food again this year as it was last year . Mary tells the children : * Most of the townfolks in this place worked whole * * week even on Sundays when they should be in church * * honoring God . These townfolks swears and * * uses her Son 's name in bad words . That is * why her Son 's arm is so heavy in pain . Then she asked them if they pray . The children said `` hardly '' . She asked them to pray every morning and night . When the children went back from work they had to tell somebody about this . When the news was spred and after thorough * investigation of the incident , the townfolks * * were converted and faith and obedience to God * * were restored in their community . * Once again , the Lamb succeeds . -Marida `` ... spreading God 's words through actions ...

I do n't know where you live , but I would be much more worried about cops , other traffic etc . than the road surface at 130 . It just is n't that fast or that dangerous .

From : jartsu @ hut.fi ( Jartsu ) Subject : HELP WANTED ! Monitor problems ( NEC 3D & IIvi ) Nntp-Posting-Host : lk-hp-15.hut.fi Reply-To : jartsu @ vipunen.hut.fi Organization : Helsinki University of Technology , Finland Lines : 107 Hello all ! For few past days I 've been fighting to get My NEC Multisync 3D ( predecessor of 3FG ) to work properly with the internal video of Mac IIvi . With a VGA-adapter ( as described in Dale Adams ' posting about Quadra video ) it works , only some minor interferences occur , small enough not to prevent any action on screen to be visible & clear . But because the scanrates & stuff of 3D are well enough for emulating Apple 13 '' RGB , I first made an adapter , then got one fron the local distributor of NEC . With both adapters I can get a picure , which looks excellent most of the time or every now and then . But with radical changes on screen ( opening palettes , large windows etc . ) there are major interferences in sync . The picture either tilts sideways or scrables up totally . Even when it is clear , there are some '' spiky '' interferences on horizontal line alignment when accessing pull-downs etc . With the self-made adapter , almost identical to the VGA one , only sense pins differ , it is sometimes impossible to even boot up with a picture clear enough to shut down from menu ... With the adapter from NEC , everything is well most of the time , but sometimes the picture tilts badly sideways or the sync is completely lost . But not nearly as often as with the self-made one . I know , with self made adapters there can always be interference , but with the one provided by NEC ... where 's the source of this interference ? I 'll give you the pinouts of the whole mess , and I hope that you can , at least someone ( please try = ) figure out what could be the best pin assignment for NEC 3D . I am going to make a completely new cable with maximum shieldings and isolations , as soon as someone figures out how the pins should be arranged , especially syncs and groundings . Yes , I have checked that the monitor is not defective , it works perfectly well with all PC graphic adapters up to 1024x768 pixels and also Atari 71Hz monochrome , which I am using now with it . Here are the pinouts & stuff : 15 pin mini D-sub ( NEC 3D ) 15 pin D-sub ( Mac , at least Quadra ) 1 Red Video 1 Red GND 2 Green Video 2 Red Video 3 Blue Video 3 Composite Sync 4 GND 4 Sense 0 5 GND 5 Green Video 6 Red GND 6 Green GND 7 Green GND 7 Sense 1 8 Blue GND 8 NC 9 NC 9 Blue Video 10 GND 10 Sense 2 11 GND 11 C.Sync & V.Sync GND 12 NC 12 V.Sync 13 H.Sync 13 Blue GND 14 V.Sync 14 H.Sync GND 15 NC 15 H.Sync SHELL GND SHELL GND Connection suggested by Apple for VGA/SVGA , sense pins changed to emulate Apple 13 '' with Multisync ( my self-made adapter ) Multisync ( 15pin mini D-sub ) Mac ( 15pin D-sub ) 1 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 2 2 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 5 3 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 9 6 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 1 7 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 6 8 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 13 10 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 14 13 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 15 14 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 12 4 ( sense0 ) grounded to 11 ( sync GND ) Connection measured from an adapter to make NEC 3FG/4FG emulate Apple 13 '' ( adapter provided by NEC representative ) NEC ( 15 mini ) Mac ( 15 ) 1 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 2 2 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 5 3 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 9 4 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - SHELL GND , 1 , 4 , 6 , 13 5 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - same as above 6 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - same ... 7 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - same ... 8 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - same ... 10 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - same ... 11 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - same ... 13 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 3 14 * Not Connected ! * Well , I am waiting for your solutions ...

The question you ask is complicated and deserves an honest answer . I am going to provide one from my own current perspective , not a historical one . Currently , as a non-observant jew/Israeli/American , my own feeling is that Jews from the diaspora do not have a greater right in Palestine or Israel , than the palestinians or Israelis ( both arab and jew ) do . With regard to Jewish Israelis , they should have the same rights in Israel as do all other Israelis . | > 2 ) Why do most of them speak of the west bank as theirs while most of | > the inhabitants are not Jews and do not want to be part of Israel ? Who are them ? If by them you mean the non-religious Jews , I think you should be aware by now that the majority of the settlers and their supporters are religious . The other part of the problem is , to my knowledge , not that the palestinians do n't want to be a part of Israel , as much as they would accept ( for the most part ) being full citizens of Israel , with all the priviliges and responsibilities accorded Israeli citizens . What they object to is the current limbo in which they find themselves . -- Shai Guday | Stealth bombers , OS Software Engineer | Thinking Machines Corp. | the winged ninjas of the skies .

If this is true why does windows report the memory is > available to me if it 's not going to use it ? I think the support droid was malfunctioning and confused the disk space limit with the virtual address space limit . As far as the disk is concerned , you are limited only by the amount of contiguous free space . The limit that causes the message , `` Windows will only use ... , '' is the amount of virtual address space that the Virtual Memory Manager will create , and this is a function of the amount of free memory that you have when Windows starts . In the [ 386enh ] section of SYSTEM.INI , you can specify a parameter : PageOverCommit=multiplier The following description is from the Windows Resource Kit : This entry specifies the multiplier what determines the amount of linear address space the VMM will create for the system , which is computed by rounding up the amount of available physical memory to the nearest 4 MB and then multiplying that value by the value specified for PageOverCommit= . Increasing this value increases the amount of available linear address space , causing the size of data structures to increase . This also increases paging activity proportionately and can slow down the system . You can specify a value between 1 and 20 . The default is 4 . To change this entry , you must edit SYSTEM.INI . -- Bob Nichols AT & T Bell Laboratories rnichols @ ihlpm.ih.att.com

There are roughly 1200 fatal , firearms-related accidents each year . The large majority involve rifles and shotgun ; there are under 500 fatal handgun accidents each year . I really doubt all of those occur while the pistol is holstered , so the number of `` self-inflicted gunshot wounds by people wearing thigh holsters '' is probably well under 250 per year . > > If you fall , for example , > > and land on the handgun or cause a sudden blow , the gun will discharge . Handguns designs have included a `` hammer block '' since around 1960 or earlier . This is a metal part which physically seperates the cartridge and the firing pin : Even under impact , the gun can not fire . The hammer block is connected to the trigger and is pulled out of the way as the trigger is pulled . As a result , modern pistols can fire _only_ if the trigger is pulled ( or in some cases , if they are cocked by hand and then dropped . ) > > The number of people killed in this manner far outweighs the number of > > deaths caused by animal attacks or `` wacko '' attacks combined . I do n't know about animal attacks , but there are 23,500 murders each year and under 500 die in the manner you suggest . If only 2.1 % of the murders were killings by `` wacko '' s , you would be wrong . Worse , there are also 102,500 rapes and 1,055,000 aggravated assaults each year . These numbers make violent attacks , and preventing them , thousands of times more significant than the accidents you are worried about . ( These figures , by the way , are from the FBI 's `` Uniform Crime Report '' for 1990 . I 'll stop by a library tomorrow and look at the `` National Crime Victimization Survey '' , which is more specific about where and when the crimes occured . ) Frank Crary CU Boulder

My guess is Jordan will eventually end up being odd man out due to low on base percentage . Whiten was a great acquisition ... decent offense and great defense in rightfield . But do n't worry , Gilkey will be starting as soon as Jordan or Whiten displays an extended period of low offensive output .

It is Armenian soldiers from mainland Armenia that are shelling towns in Azarbaijan . You might wish to read more about whether or not it is Azeri aggression only in that region .

Gregg is not , as I understand his posts , giving any support to the bounty on Rushdie 's life . If that 's correct , end of one point ... Gregg is using the concept of legal in a way most Westerners do n't accept . His comments about Islamic Law I think make a great deal of sense to him , and are even making a _little_ sense to me now - if a person is a member of a group ( religion or whatever ) they bind themselves to follow the ways of the group within the bounds of what the group requires as a minimum . The big bone of contention here that I 'm picking up is that in the West we have secular governments that maintain , more or less , a level of control and of requirements outside the requirements of optional groups . I think the majority of us reading this thread are in tune ( note - I did n't say '' in agreement '' ) with the idea that you are finally responsible to the secular government , and within that to the group or groups a person may have chosen . With that in mind , it not possible under secular law ( `` legally '' as most people would define the term ) to hold a person to a particular group once they decide to separate from it . Only if the secular authorities agree that there is a requirement of some sort ( contractual , etc ) is there any secular _enforcement_ allowed by a group to a group member or past group member . A religion can , and often does , believe in and require additional duties of a group member . And it can enforce the fulfillment of those duties in many ways - ostracism is common for example . But the limit comes when the enforcement would impose unwanted and/or unaccepted onus on a person _in conflict with secular law_ . This is the difference . In a theocracy , the requirements of the secular authorities are , by definition , congruent with the religious authorities . Outside a theocracy , this is not _necessarily_ true . Religious requirements _may_ coincide or may not . Similiarly , religious consequences _may_ or may not coincide with secular consequences ( if any ) .

Fred Rice answered this already in an early posting : '' The problem with your argument is that you do not _know_ who is a _real_ believer and who may be `` faking it '' . This is something known only by the person him/herself ( and God ) . Your assumption that anyone who _claims_ to be a `` believer '' _is_ a `` believer '' is not necessarily true .

Yes , on the showroom floor , the cars have this deep , lustrous shine that just ca n't be found on paint jobs that are n't clear coated . On the other hand , it seems that every clear coated car that I 've seen on the road ( in a parking lot , etc . ) has fine scratches throughout the paint job . As does , alas , my 1992 Laser . Several weeks ago I had my car professionally polished and waxed . When I picked it up , it had that same showroom shine that I remember from a year ago when I bought it . Several days ago I took my car to the dealership for some work . As an added bonus , they washed my car . Unfortunately , whoever washed it either did n't get the roof ( which is black , the rest of the car is red ) completely clean before he dried it , or he used a dirty towel . Now my showroom shine is a haze of fine scratches that are n't really visible until the light hits the roof at a particular angle . I am , to put it mildy , somewhat peeved about this . Do I have any chance of getting the dealership to do something about this ? My guess is 'no ' . Is there any product on the market that provides a solution to this problem ? Or am I faced with the prospect of having the car professionally polished again to hide the scratches ? Information , commiseration , and sympathy all greatly appreciated . . .

I think , with really large keyspaces like this , you need to alter the strategy discussed for DES . Attempt decryption of several blocks , and check the disctribution of the contents . I do n't think it's at all feasible to keep 2**80 encryptions of a known plaintext block on *any* amount of tape or CD-ROM . And certainly not 2**128 such encrypted blocks . ( Anyone know a cheap way of converting every atom in the solar system into a one bit storage device ? ) Actually , a keysearch of this kind should n't be much worse than the simpler kind in terms of speed . It 's just that you have to do it over for *every* encrypted message . Dumb question : Has anyone ever done any serious research on how many legitimate ASCII-encoded 8-byte blocks there are that could be part of an english sentence ? For attacking DES in ECB mode , it seems like a dictionary of this kind might be pretty valuable ... . -- John Kelsey

It 's not a bad question : I do n't have any refs that list this algorithm either . But thinking about it a bit , it should n't be too hard . 1 ) Take three of the points and find the plane they define as well as the circle that they lie on ( you say you have this algorithm already ) 2 ) Find the center of this circle . The line passing through this center perpendicular to the plane of the three points passes through the center of the sphere . 3 ) Repeat with the unused point and two of the original points . This gives you two different lines that both pass through the sphere's origin . Their interection is the center of the sphere . 4 ) the radius is easy to compute , it 's just the distance from the center to any of the original points . I 'll leave the math to you , but this is a workable algorithm . : - ) An alternate method would be to take pairs of points : the plane formed by the perpendicular bisector of each line segment pair also contains the center of the sphere . Three pairs will form three planes , intersecting at a point . This might be easier to implement . -Steve spworley @ netcom.com

From : frank @ marvin.contex.com ( Frank Perdicaro ) Subject : ST1100 ride Keywords : heavy Lines : 95 Sixteen days I had put off test driving the Honda ST1100 . Finally , the 17th was a Saturday without much rain . In fact it cleared up , became warm and sunny , and the wind died . About three weeks ago , I took a long cool ride on the Hawk down to Cycles ! 128 for a test ride . They had sold , and delivered , the demo ST1100 about fifteen hours before I arrived . And the demo VFR was bike-locked in the showroom -- surrounded by 150 other bikes , and not likely to move soon . Today was different . There were even more bikes . 50 used dirt bikes , 50 used street bikes , 35 cars , and a big tent full of Outlandishly Fat Touring Bikes With Trailers were all squeezed in the parking lot . Some sort of fat bike convention . Shelly and Dave were running one MSF course each , at the same time . One in the classroom and one on the back lot . Plus , there was the usuall free cookout food that Cycles ! gives away every weekend in the summer . Hmmm , it seemed like a big moto party . After about ten minutes of looking for Rob C , cheif of sales slime , and another 5 minutes reading and signing a long disclosure/libility/ pray-to-god form I helped JT push the ST out into the mess in the parking lot . We went over the the controls , I put the tank bag from the Hawk into the right saddlebag , and my wife put everything else into the left saddlebag . ( Thats nice ... . ) Having helped push the ST out to the lot , I thought it best to have JT move it to the edge of the road , away from the 100+ bikes and 100+ people . He rode it like a bicycle ! 'It cant be that heavy ' I thought . Well I was wrong . As I sat on the ST , both feet down , all I could think was `` big '' . Then I put one foot up . `` Heavy '' came to mind very quickly . With Cindy on the back -- was she on the back ? Hard to tell with seat three times as large as a Hawk seat -- the bike seemed nearly out of control just idling on the side of the road . By 3000 rpm in second gear , all the weight seemed to dissappear . Even on bike with 4.1 miles on the odometer , slippery new tires , and pads that did not yet bite the disks , things seems smooth and sure . Cycles ! is on a section of 128 that few folks ever ride . About 30 miles north of the computer concentration , about five miles north of where I95 splits away , 128 is a lighly travelled , two lane limited access highway . It goes through heavily forested sections of Hamilton , Manchester-by-the-Sea and Newbury on its way to Gloucester . On its way there , it meets 133 , a road that winds from the sea about 30 miles inland to Andover . On its way it goes through many thoroughly New England spots . Perfect , if slow , sport touring sections . Cindy has no difficulty with speed . 3rd gear , 4th gear , purring along in top gear . This thing has less low rpm grunt that my Hawk . Lane changes were a new experience . A big heft is required to move this thing . Responds well though . No wallowing or complaint . Behind the fairing it was fairly quiet , but the helmet buffeting was non-trivial . Top gear car passing at 85mph was nearly effortless . Smooth , smooth , smooth . Not sure what the v4 sound reminds me of , but it is pleasant . If only the bars were not transmitting an endless buzz . The jump on to 133 caused me to be less than impressed with the brakes . Its a down hill , reversing camber , twice-reversing radius , decreasing radius turn . A real squeeze is needed on the front binder . The section of 133 we were on was tight , but too urban . The ST works ok in this section , but it shows its weight . We went by the clam shack oft featured in `` Spencer for Hire '' -- a place where you could really find `` Spencer '' , his house was about 15 miles down 133 . After putting through traffic for a while , we turned and went back to 128 . About half way through the onramp , I yanked Cindy 's wrist , our singal for `` hold on tight '' . Head check left , time to find redline . Second gear gives a good shove . Third too . Fourth sees DoD speed with a short shift into top . On the way to 133 we saw no cops and very light traffic . Did not cross into DoD zone because the bike was too new . Well , now it had 25 miles on it , so it was ok . Tried some high effort lane changes , some wide sweeping turns . Time to wick it up ? I went until the buffeting was threating to pull us off the seat . And stayed there . When I was comfortable with the wind and the steering , I looked down to find an indicated 135mph . Not bad for 2-up touring . Beverly comes fast at more than twice the posted limit . At the `` get off in a mile '' sign , I rolled off the throttle and coasted . I wanted to re-adjust to the coming slowness . It was a good idea : there were several manhole-sized patches of sand on the exit ramp . Back to the slow and heavy behavior . Cycles ! is about a mile from 128 . I could see even more cars stacked up outside right when I got off . I managed to thread the ST through the cars to the edge of the concrete pad out front . Heavy . It took way too much effort for Cindy and I to put the thing on the center stand . I am sure that if I used the side stand the ST would have been on its side within a minute . My demo opinion ? Heavy . Put it on a diet . Smooth , comfortable , hardly notices the DoD speed . I 'd buy on for about $ 3000 less than list , just like it is . Too much $ for the bike as it is . -- Frank Evan Perdicaro Xyvision Color Systems Legalize guns , drugs and cash ... today . 101 Edgewater Drive inhouse : frank @ marvin , x5572 Wakefield MA outhouse : frank @ contex.com , 617-245-4100x5572 018801285

You know , in many ways this might be just the kick we need to straighten things out in this country . Also , people would have a need to replace guns with something else , perhaps deadly sprays that would make Mace and OC seem like water . They would be lighter and easier to conceal . Guns are really `` old '' in design and as long as we have tons of them , no one is motivated to design something better . I 'm sure we could come up with some real nasty stuff if we tried and getting rid of these guns would get us moving on this track asap . This is what we really want , right ? Stuff that 's smaller , lighter and far more deadly . Remember , in this country we 'll really scramble to accomplish impossible feats if we are motivated enough and I think `` self-defense '' is high on our list of motivators .

This is very interesting . I have come exactly to the same conclusions but in regards to *conventional* medicine . You see , I do n't just treat little old ladies that would n't know any different of what is being done , but a bulk of my patients consist of teachers , lawyers , judges , nurses , accountants , university graduates , and various health practitioners . If these people have gotten results with my method after having been unsuccessful with yours or their own , I certainly would n't lose any sleep over whether you or your peers approve of my treatments -- - let 's face it , with all the blunders committed by `` scientific '' MDs over the years , I know a lot of people who hold your *scientific* method in much lower esteem than they hold mine ! GR > As far as we know ayurveda = crystals = homeopathy = Ron Roth GR > which may all equal placebo administered with appropriate GR > trappings ... Sorry , but I 'm not familiar OR interested with what appears to be 'NEW AGE ' medicine ( ayurveda , crystals ) , with the exception of homeo- pathy , of which I took a course . But Gordon , you already knew that - you just wanted to make my system look a bit more far out , right ? I use homeopathy very little , since my cellular test ( EMR ) is hard to beat for accuracy and minerals are more predictable , while homeopathy does have a problem with reliability , especially in acute conditions . An exception perhaps are homeopathic nosodes which act fairly quickly and are more dependable in certain viral or bacterial situations .

I have met the challenges of hundreds of sceptics by verifying the accuracy of measuring their mineral status to their total satisfac- tion -- - in other words EVERYONE INVOLVED is happy ! If you were to cook a meal , would you worry over whether EVERYONE in this world would find it to their liking , or only those that end up eating it ? Since I have financed every research project that I have undertaken entirely myself , I do n't need to follow any of your rules or guide- lines to satisfy any aspects of a grant application , which YOU may have to ; neither am I concerned of whether or not my study designs meet your or anyone else 's criteria or acceptance .

I think there would be more justification for an uneducated person growing up in an uncivilized environment to believe in a flat earth , than for a civilized , well educated and scientifically trained mind to follow the doctrine of evolution . Genetic engineering of course is now the final frontier to show God how it is ( properly ) done . Now we 've become capable of creating our own paradise and give disease ( and God ) the boot , right ? But just before we get rid of Him for good , perhaps He could leave us some pointers on how to solve a couple of tiny problems , such as war , poverty , racism , crime , riots , substance abuse ... And one last thing , could He also give us a hint on how to control natural disasters , the weather , and last , but not least -- - peace ? -- Ron -- -- - RoseReader 2.00 P003228 : The Lab called : Your brain is ready .

As usual , the bias of the 'Center for Policy Research ' echoes through this newsgroup . Here we have an enraged Likudnik who is venting his spleen , and you portray it as if this is going to become policy . You do n't say what the response to Matza's suggestion was . Do do not mention whether he was refering to terrorists caught in the act , which could be a clear cut case of self-defence .

A laudable precaution . Every single thing you post about Israel is posted to portray Israel as negatively as you can . Deliberate omissions are an integral part of the shtick . And it 's not only the incidents that you do not mention , but even the stories you do post are fraught with omissions , which change the entire meaning . The absurdity of your respectable name can not hide your bias . In your effort to portray Israel in an unfavorable light , you have accomplished nothing , except to prove that a respectable sounding label like the Center for Policy Research is nothing but a smoke screen for someone with a heavily biased attitude against Israel and the need to vent it .

That 's why the use of the 10K 5W resistor here to add extra current thru the blinker to make up for the current shunted thru the second string while the blinker is glowing and the second string is not glowing . When the blinker goes open , this resistor has only a slight effect on the brightness of the strings , s1 slightly dimmer , s2 slightly brighter . Or use a 3W 120v bulb in place of the 10K resistor if you can get one . Caution , do not replace with a standard C9 bulb , as these draw too much current and burn out the blinker . C9 = approx 7W . What you 'll see when it 's working : powerup , string 1 will light at full brightness , and b will be lit , bypassing most of the current from the second string , making them not light . b will open , placing both strings in series , making the string that was out to glow at a low brightness , and the other string that was on before to glow at reduced brightness . Be sure to wire and insulate the splices , resistor leads , and cut wires in a safe manner !

The cash registers used microprocessor circuits and back then they were VERY susceptible to electrostatic discharge and line noise . The biggest problems came from outlets that were not properly grounded . In almost every place we went to do an installation , we found outlets with the ground connected to the neutral . For 99.9 % of the things you can plug into one of these , they work fine . For our cash registers they were a nightmare -- line noise tended to scramble the memory periodically . With modern electronics using switching power supplies this should be less of a problem . Even the company I used to work for is no longer recommending a dedicated line with a seperate ground for their equipment . I imagine if you check MOST household wiring you will find that the ground and neutral are connected . Although not ideal , it should be o.k . for most applications . -- - . SLMR 2.1 .

When that light goes on , I just take it to the delaer tell them `` It 's that time '' and they work on it for 4 hou and you pay $ 5 for parts and $ 100 for labor .

And that was all done within the past 2 months . What I do at 30K is have a good tune-up , let them replace what ever they need to , pay the bill ( about $ 125 ) and go home and do n't worry about the car for another 30K . Oh , I just remembered something . If that little sensor light bothers you , in the fuse box right below the turn-signal lever up against the dash , there is a swith on the right side .

Once again , Mark , you do n't specify the means through which the government is to be prevented from becoming the tool of business interests . As a left-wing , big government , conventional liberal , I 'm just as willing as you are to vote against anti-competitive regulations that favor auto dealers . But what I hear from libertarians is a desire to limit incumbents ' terms , to weaken government by eliminating its power to enforce antitrust laws , and a desire to eliminate legislator 's pay .

If I read you right , you 're saying in essence that , with a larger economy , nations will have more discretionary funds to *waste* on a lunar facility . That was certainly partially the case with Apollo , but real Lunar colonies will probably require a continuing military , scientific , or commercial reason for being rather than just a `` we have the money , why not ? '' approach . Ah , but the whole point is that money spent on a lunar base is not wasted on the moon . It 's not like they 'd be using $ 1000 ( 1000R ? ) bills to fuel their moon-dozers . The money to fund a lunar base would be spent in the country to which the base belonged . It 's a way of funding high-tech research , just like DARPA was a good excuse to fund various fields of research , under the pretense that it was crucial to the defense of the country , or like ESPRIT is a good excuse for the EC to fund research , under the pretense that it 's good for pan-European cooperation . Now maybe you think that government-funded research is a waste of money ( in fact , I 'm pretty sure you do ) , but it does count as investment spending , which does boost the economy ( and just look at the size of that multiplier : - > ) .

Apple has patented their implementation of regions , which presumably includes the internal data structure ( which has never been officially documented by Apple ) . Apple can not patent the concept of a region . I 'm guessing that either NuTek reverse-engineered Apple 's internal data structure for regions ( I dunno if this would hold up in court ) , or they came up with their own data structure . If it 's the latter , then they wo n't be able to draw PICT files containing regions . Besides PICT files , there are n't many places where regions are stored on disk . ( QuickTime movies , perhaps ? ) As long as the region is n't being stored on disk and transferred from a Mac to a NuTek clone ( or vice versa ) , it doesn't matter if NuTek uses a completely different internal data structure .

Dave Winfield has had a better career than half the people in the Hall of Fame . Eddie Murray and Darrel Evans are both one of the top 100 players of all time . Lee Smith has had probably the greatest long career of any relief pitcher since 1960 , with the possible exception of Gossage . On the other hand , Kingman probably is n't one of the best 750 players of all time . And Reardon , though a good pitcher , is n't in Smith 's class career wise . > Well , in any case , I am sick and tired ( mostly sick ) of everybody > giving > Hall of Fame consideration to players that are by today 's standards , > marginal . > Honestly , Ozzie Smith and Robin Yount do n't belong there .

Morris , while a very good pitcher , simply doesn't belong near Cooperstown . Gee , can these guys even compare to > the more likely future Hall of Famers like Kirby Puckett or Nolan Ryan ? If Puckett and Ryan ( okay , no if there ) get into to the Hall , they will be marginal Hall of Famers ( unless Puckett keeps hitting like he did last year for a while longer ) To put this in perspective , here 's a listing of the linear weights values of the careers of the players you mention . In parenthesis is how high they are up on the greatest ever list if they make it . While no one would claim these are perfect rankings , they should give you a good value of these guys ' careers as compared to average players . Robin Yount 43.0 ( 41 ) Ozzie Smith 42.1 ( 45 ) Dave Winfield 40.3 ( 53 ) Eddie Murray 37.5 ( 68 ) Darrel Evans 35.2 ( 80 ) Kirby Puckett 24.3 ( 180 ) Nolan Ryan 21.6 ( 219 ) Jack Morris 11.8 ( 478 ) Dave Kingman 0.4 Steve Garvey -5.8 To give you an idea of how these numbers compare to those in the Hall : Of the 71 eligible players whose career stats equaled 35.0 , 64 are in the Hall of Fame . The ones who are n't include 4 19th century players , Ron Santo , Bobby Grich , and Bob Johnson . Of those eligible who score between 30.0 and 34.9 , 15 of 25 are in .

The initiative will involve the creation of new products to accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links . For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of protecting Americans . Rather than use technology to accommodate the sometimes competing interests of economic growth , privacy and law enforcement , previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement . Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to protect electronic funds transfer . It is now being used to protect electronic mail and computer files . While encryption technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release of personal information , it also can be used by terrorists , drug dealers , and other criminals . A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the `` Clipper Chip '' has been developed by government engineers . The chip represents a new approach to encryption technology . It can be used in new , relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to an ordinary telephone . It scrambles telephone communications using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in commercial use today . This new technology will help companies protect proprietary information , protect the privacy of personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted electronically . At the same time this technology preserves the ability of federal , state and local law enforcement agencies to intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals . A `` key-escrow '' system will be established to ensure that the '' Clipper Chip '' is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding Americans . Each device containing the chip will have two unique 2 '' keys , '' numbers that will be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by the device . When the device is manufactured , the two keys will be deposited separately in two `` key-escrow '' data bases that will be established by the Attorney General . Access to these keys will be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a wiretap . The `` Clipper Chip '' technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans . To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology , the Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new devices . In addition , respected experts from outside the government will be offered access to the confidential details of the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings . The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of encryption 's dual-edge sword : encryption helps to protect the privacy of individuals and industry , but it also can shield criminals and terrorists . We need the `` Clipper Chip '' and other approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it to hide their illegal activities . In order to assess technology trends and explore new approaches ( like the key-escrow system ) , the President has directed government agencies to develop a comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates : -- the privacy of our citizens , including the need to employ voice or data encryption for business purposes ; -- the ability of authorized officials to access telephone calls and data , under proper court or other legal order , when necessary to protect our citizens ; -- the effective and timely use of the most modern technology to build the National Information Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and the competitiveness of American industry in the global marketplace ; and -- the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export high technology products . The President has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries , the Congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed . 3 The Administration is committed to working with the private sector to spur the development of a National Information Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to information . This infrastructure of high-speed networks ( `` information superhighways '' ) will transmit video , images , HDTV programming , and huge data files as easily as today 's telephone system transmits voice . Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important role in that infrastructure , the Federal Government must act quickly to develop consistent , comprehensive policies regarding its use . The Administration is committed to policies that protect all Americans ' right to privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law . Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet . The provisions of the President 's directive to acquire the new encryption technology are also available . For additional details , call Mat Heyman , National Institute of Standards and Technology , ( 301 ) 975-2758 . - - -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S TELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE Q : Does this approach expand the authority of government agencies to listen in on phone conversations ? A : No . `` Clipper Chip '' technology provides law enforcement with no new authorities to access the content of the private conversations of Americans . Q : Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation encrypted using the device . What would they have to do to decipher the message ? A : They would have to obtain legal authorization , normally a court order , to do the wiretap in the first place . They would then present documentation of this authorization to the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug smugglers . The key is split into two parts , which are stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key escrow system . Q : Who will run the key-escrow data banks ? A : The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent entities . At this point , the Department of Justice and the Administration have yet to determine which agencies will oversee the key-escrow data banks . Q : How strong is the security in the device ? How can I be sure how strong the security is ? A : This system is more secure than many other voice encryption systems readily available today . While the algorithm will remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow system , we are willing to invite an independent panel of cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all potential users that there are no unrecognized vulnerabilities . Q : Whose decision was it to propose this product ? A : The National Security Council , the Justice Department , the Commerce Department , and other key agencies were involved in this decision . This approach has been endorsed by the President , the Vice President , and appropriate Cabinet officials . Q : Who was consulted ? The Congress ? Industry ? A : We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on encryption issues , and expect those discussions to intensify as we carry out our review of encryption policy . We have briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the decisions related to this initiative . Q : Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers ? A : The government designed and developed the key access encryption microcircuits , but it is not providing the microcircuits to product manufacturers . Product manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip manufacturer that produces them . Q : Who provides the `` Clipper Chip '' ? A : Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance , California , and will sell the chip to encryption device manufacturers . The programming function could be licensed to other vendors in the future . Q : How do I buy one of these encryption devices ? A : We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating the `` Clipper Chip '' into their devices . Q : If the Administration were unable to find a technological solution like the one proposed , would the Administration be willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more powerful encryption devices ? A : This is a fundamental policy question which will be considered during the broad policy review . The key escrow mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product that is more secure , more convenient , and less expensive than others readily available today , but it is just one piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to encryption technology , which the Administration is developing . The Administration is not saying , `` since encryption threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement , we will prohibit it outright '' ( as some countries have effectively done ) ; nor is the U.S. saying that `` every American , as a matter of right , is entitled to an unbreakable commercial encryption product . '' There is a false `` tension '' created in the assessment that this issue is an `` either-or '' proposition . Rather , both concerns can be , and in fact are , harmoniously balanced through a reasoned , balanced approach such as is proposed with the `` Clipper Chip '' and similar encryption techniques . Q : What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton Administration 's policy toward encryption will differ from that of the Bush Administration ? A : It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption technology in telecommunications and computing and are committed to working with industry and public-interest groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans' privacy , help businesses to compete , and ensure that law enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime and terrorism . Q : Will the devices be exportable ? Will other devices that use the government hardware ? A : Voice encryption devices are subject to export control requirements . Case-by-case review for each export is required to ensure appropriate use of these devices . The same is true for other encryption devices . One of the attractions of this technology is the protection it can give to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad . With this in mind , we expect export licenses will be granted on a case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these devices to secure their own communications abroad . We plan to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability of these products .

No . There are two problems here : ( 1 ) Peter died two millenia ago . The original letters he wrote have long since decayed into dust . If he were alive today and I could question him , then this might lend credibility to your claims ( but probably not much , because after all , I 've heard people claim with all sincerity that they 've spoken with Elvis recently ) . But after his death , Peter 's writings were transcribed by monks for centuries , and I find it hard to believe that one of them somewhere did n't decide to change the wording of something to make it ( in his opinion ) a little easier to understand . ( 2 ) Even if Peter did witness the miracles of Jesus two millenia ago , that does n't mean that your deity is what the Bible says it is ( God might just be Satan , trying to convince everyone that he 's a nice guy ) , or even that your deity is still alive and active in the world today . Nice try , but it just is n't enough to convince me , especially since your wild claims about your deity seem to fly in the face of the way I 've observed the world to work .

I repeat , as I have said in previous > postings on AA : I *have* read TSV from cover to cover I had not seen that claim , or I might have been less sweeping . You have made what I consider factual misstatements about events in the book , which I have raised in the past , in the `` ISLAM : a clearer view '' thread as well as the root of the `` Yet more Rushdie [ Re : ISLAMIC LAW ] '' thread . My statement was not that you had not read the book , but that you had not convinced me that you [ inter alia ] had . As I said before , if you want to defend your position , then produce evidence , and respond to the evidence I have posted ; so far you have not . Of course , my statement was not directly aimed at you , but broadly at a number of Muslim posters who have repeated propaganda about the book , indicating that they have n't read it , and narrowly at Gregg Jaeger , who subsequently admitted that he had n't in fact read the book , vindicating my skepticism in at least that one case . So far , the only things I have to go on regarding your own case are a ) the statements you made concerning the book in the `` a clearer view '' posting , which I have challenged ( not interpretation , but statements of fact , for instance `` Rushdie depicts the women of the most respected family in all of Islam as whores '' ) , and b ) your claim ( which I had not seen before this ) that you have indeed read it cover to cover . I am willing to try to resolve this down to a disagreement on critical interpretation , but you 'll have to support your end , by responding to my criticism . I have no doubt as to the ability of a particular Muslim to go through this book with a highlighter finding passages to take personal offense at , but you have upheld the view that `` TSV *is* intended as an attack on Islam and upon Muslims '' . This view must be defended by more than mere assertion , if you want anyone to take it seriously . > I am trying very hard to be amicable and rational . And I appreciate it , but welcome to the club . I am defending my honest opinion that this book should not be construed as a calculated ( or otherwise ) insulting attack on Islam , and the parallel opinion that most of the criticism of the book I have seen is baseless propaganda . I have supported my statements and critical interpretationa with in-context quotes from the book and Rushdie's essays , which is more than my correspondents have done . Of course , you are more than welcome to do so . -- Jim Perry perry @ dsinc.com Decision Support , Inc. , Matthews NC These are my opinions . For a nominal fee , they can be yours .

I have Quicken 6 , and it 's wonderful for some things , but MYM seems to have some features that Q6 does n't . For example , Q6 does n't seem to be able to handle monthly automatic deductions from a checking account ( you know , a monthly payment that gets electronically deducted every month from my checking account ) . Or is there something that I 'm not doing right , and Q6 can actually do that ? Anyway , MYM seems to be able to handle monthly deductions . In fact , it can apparently do better than that . That is , you can specify monthly , bimonthly , quarterly , even yearly . Anyway , is anyone aware of a comparitive study of the two programs ? Or can someone just give me their own personal impressions ? Maybe someone who has used both . Or maybe someone who is familiar with each could give me a capsule review ? Anything would be greatly appreciated . If I keep MYM , I have to pay for it , and I do n't know whether it 's worth doing . If MYM is better than Q6 , of course I will keep it . But if Q6 can do everything MYM can do ( maybe even better ) , I wo n't . Thanks all ! If you post a reply , please also cc me . Thanks .

Note : I am *not* a cable freak , so I might have completely misunderstood what you said . Also , my math is frequently noted for being wrong , so you 'll better check the calculations yourself . I assume that 14.4K means 14.4K Bits . So if we assume one start and one stopbit , and no protocol overhead , the effective number of bytes per second is 1.44K . Let 's also assume that you do not want to transmit your speech in stereo , so that you can send 1,440 samples/sec . This corresponds to a Nyquist frequency of 720 Hz , which should be too low , especially if you think about the 8-bit low quality sound . Furthermore , your D/A converter will probably not present you with a signal that has been cut off at 720 Hz , but will instead alias in all the higher frequencies . ( Although you can definitely build a filter to overcome that problem . ) On the other hand , speech should be easily compressible . For example , you could form power spectra , or you could simply band-pass filter and then linearize the fourier transforms . It wo n't be CD quality sound , but it 'll be discernible . The power spectrum method is very good in that respect . I have once programmed such a software compressor , and compression rates of 90 % with relative errors due to linearization of less than 5 % were common . Although I must say that these were musical sounds , not speech . Have fun . -- Stephan < neuhaus @ informatik.uni-kl.de > sig closed for inventory . Please leave your pickaxe outside .

With the DeskJet > Portable , you even get an undocumented PCMCIA card slot ! I second that suggestion . Although I do n't own the HP Portable Deskjet , I *do* own the HP Deskjet 500 . It gives the nicest outputs , with only a minor loss of quality . For all intensive purposes ( papers , letters , resumes ) , I treat my Deskjet like a laser printer ( You *do* have to look a bit closely to see the blurs in the characters ) . Only one grudge , the ink that HP gives you does smudge rather quickly in the presence of moisture ( Even though the ink is waterproof ) . However , you would have to spend about $ 500 more for laser quality . The cannon bubblejets are nice , however they do n't seem to have as much support ( eg : drivers for popular programs ) as the HP ink-jets . Also HP Deskjet ( regular , plus,500,500c ) accepts xerox paper ( I believe that the cut-sheet feeder is an option for the cannon bubblejet ) . If you do n't mind refilling your printer with cheap ink ( say fountain-pen ink ) , then the HP deskjets are *very* cheap to maintain ( I paid $ 3.50 for my last bottle of ink and I expect it to last 9 months ) . -Kimball ( who does n't work for HP , but just loves his printer very much ! ) PS : I have a question for you netters , I 'm too afraid to refill with the waterproof inks they sell in art-supply houses because I had brought a bottle of waterproof ink and it clogged up my cartridge . I wonder what is a 'good ' waterproof ink ( aside from buying refill-kits ) to refill my cartridge ?

Any strong atheists out there > care to comment ? As far as I can tell , strong atheists are far > outnumbered on alt.atheism by weak atheists . At the cost of repudiating the FAQ , I think too much is made of the strong vs weak atheism issue , although in the context of alt.atheism , where we 're continually attacked on the basis that strong atheists '' believe '' in the non-existence of god , I think the separation is a valid one . To cover my arse , what I 'm trying to say is that there is an infinitely grey area between weak and strong , as well as between strong and the unattainable mathematical atheism ( I wish ! ) . Whereas I _logically_ can only support the weak atheist position , in effect I am a strong atheist ( and wish I could be a mathematical one ) . To justify my strong atheist position I believe I need only show that the evidence presented in favour of any of the gods under scrutiny is faulty . If I read the FAQ correctly , no argument for the existence of god ( generic , as represented by mainstream theologians ) has ever been found to be unassailable . To me this is adequate evidence that the _real_god_ is undefinable ( or at least no definition has yet been found to be watertight ) , which in turn I accept as sufficient to base a disbelief in each and every conceivable god . I 'm a little fuzzy on the edges , though , so opinions are welcome ( but perhaps we should change the thread subject ) . -- Lucio de Re ( lucio @ proxima.Alt.ZA ) - tab stops at four .

In order to reply to the issue , you have to address and answer the point that was raised , and not just jump to the conclusion that you grant . The Bible states that Lucifer was created .

Mormons believe that we are `` adopted '' into the House of ra > Israel through baptism and faith in Christ , although some have expressed ra > belief that this does evince a physical change in our bodies . The Mormon belief is that all are children of God . Literally . There is nothing symbolic about it . This however , contradicts what the Bible says . The Bible teaches that not everyone is a child of God : The field is the world ; the good seed are the children of the kingdom ; but the tares are the children of the wicked [ one ] ; ( Matthew 13:38 ) I speak that which I have seen with my Father : and ye do that which ye have seen with your father . ( John 8:38 ) Ye do the deeds of your father . Then said they to him , We be not born of fornication ; we have one Father , [ even ] God . Jesus said unto them , If God were your Father , ye would love me : for I proceeded forth and came from God ; neither came I of myself , but he sent me . Why do ye not understand my speech ? [ even ] because ye can not hear my word . Ye are of [ your ] father the devil , and the lusts of your father ye will do . He was a murderer from the beginning , and abode not in the truth , because there is no truth in him . When he speaketh a lie , he speaketh of his own : for he is a liar , and the father of it . ( John 8:41-44 ) And said , O full of all subtilty and all mischief , [ thou ] child of the devil , [ thou ] enemy of all righteousness , wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord ? ( Acts 13:10 ) Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world , according to the prince of the power of the air , the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience : ( Ephesians 2:2 ) In this the children of God are manifest , and the children of the devil : whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God , neither he that loveth not his brother . ( 1 John 3:10 ) One becomes a child of God ... But as many as received him , to them gave he power to become the sons of God , [ even ] to them that believe on his name : ( John 1:12 ) Behold , what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us , that we should be called the sons of God : therefore the world knoweth us not , because it knew him not . Beloved , now are we the sons of God , and it doth not yet appear what we shall be : but we know that , when he shall appear , we shall be like him ; for we shall see him as he is . ( 1 John 3:1-2 ) ... when he is born again through faith in Jesus Christ : Which were born , not of blood , nor of the will of the flesh , nor of the will of man , but of God . ( John 1:13 ) Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself , according to the good pleasure of his will , ( Ephesians 1:5 ) Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth , that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures . ( James 1:18 ) For as many as are led by the Spirit of God , they are the sons of God . For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear ; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption , whereby we cry , Abba , Father . The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit , that we are the children of God : ( Romans 8:14-16 ) Beloved , let us love one another : for love is of God ; and every one that loveth is born of God , and knoweth God . ( 1 John 4:7 ) Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God : and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him . ( 1 John 5:1 ) For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus .

Whose `` Jesus of the Bible '' do you mean ? This is really a red herring . It does n't address any issue raised , but rather , it seeks to obfuscate . The fact that some groups try to read something into the Bible , does n't change what the Bible teaches . For example , the fact that the Jehovah 's Witnesses deny the Deity of Christ does not alter what the Bible teaches [ `` Looking for that blessed hope , and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ ; '' ( Titus 2:13 ) , '' Simon Peter , a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ , to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ : '' ( 2 Peter 1:1 ) ] on the Deity of Christ . We first look to the Bible to see what it teaches . To discount , or not even address , what the Bible teaches because there are some groups that have differing views is self-defeating . To see what the Bible teaches , you have to look at the Bible . ra > > `` Our Lord 's mortality was essential to his own salvation '' ( _The ra > > Promised Messiah_ , p. 456 ) , `` He had to work out his own salvation by ra > > doing the will of the Father in all things '' ( ibid. , p.54 ) , `` he had ra > > to be baptized to gain admission to the celestial kingdom '' ( _Mormon ra > > Doctrine_ , p.71 ) . ra > ra > Welcome to the wonderful world of Mormon paradoctrine , Robert .

When I mentioned that the Mormon belief is that Jesus needed to be saved , I put forward some quotes from the late apostle , Bruce McConkie . The curious part is that no one addressed the issue of ` Jesus needing to be saved . ' Rick comes the closest with his `` I have my own conclusions '' to addressing the point . Most of the other replies have instead hop-scotched to the issue of Bruce McConkie and whether his views were 'official doctrine . ' I don't think that it matters if McConkie 's views were canon . That is not the issue . Were McConkie 's writings indicative of Mormon belief on this subject is the real issue . The indication from Rick is that they may certainly be . ============================= Robert Weiss psyrobtw @ ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu

First , I create the shared memory segment , attach the client , attach the X server , and then remove ( ! ) the segment . If you read the man pages on removing of shared memory segments , you will see that the segment only dies after all attachments are gone .

Failures in > description are merely failures in description . How about this description : `` An object that is , at one time , both a Euclidean square and a Euclidean circle '' ? I hold that no object satisfying this description could exist . The description is inconsistent , and hence describes an object that could not exist . Now , suppose someone pointed to a bicycle , and said , `` That object is , at one time , both a Euclidean square and a Euclidean circle . '' This does not mean that the bicycle does not exist , it measn that the description was incorrectly applied . The atheist says , `` The descriptions of God that I have been presented with are contradictory , and hence describe something that can not exist . '' Now , your position ( so far as I can gather ) is that God exists , but the descriptions atheists have been presented with are simply bad descriptions of It . This is roughly analogous to someone who has never seen a bicycle , and , when they ask for a description from people who claim to have seen one , are told that it is a `` Euclidean circle-square '' . Can they be blamed for doubting rather strongly that this 'bicycle ' exists at all ? > ( I 'm not an objectivist , remember . ) No kidding . : - > Sincerely , Ray Ingles ingles @ engin.umich.edu `` The meek can *have* the Earth .

A low GAA against good > teams is much , much better than a higher GAA against bad teams in the context > of comparing two goaltenders . Let 's start over . I 'm not arguing about who is the better goaltender . I'd take Soderstrom right now . What I am saying is that Roussel can be a # 1 netminder . The GAA difference is less than half a goal per game ( less than that after last night ) , their save percentages are close , and their records are similar . And with that , I just do n't see how you can label Roussel as the most disappointing player on the Flyers this season . You say Soderstrom played against better competition . That may very well be , but there is no way of knowing how Roussel would have performed in those games . Besides , against the better scoring teams like Pittsburgh , the defense is more keyed up than they are against San Jose . > The same > for Roussel in the Ranger game . Two real scoring chances , one he made a > great play , the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player . If > you were judging Roussel on that game alone , you have very little to go by . But I 'm not just judging Roussel on that game alone . I 've seen him play for the past two seasons in Philly and before that in Hershey . It 's just my opinion , but I think he 's got what it takes . Of course , I thought that about Mark LaForest , too . But I never did about Wendell Young . So I'm batting .500 in judging Hershey talent since the Hextall-era . As for the Rangers game , you can say he was saved by a mistake by the offensive player if you like . But Rou had his leg in position to make the save . If he did n't , it would n't have mattered if the Rangers player didn't get the puck up or not . It would have been a goal . On a breakaway that's what the goalie wants to do , take away as much as possible and force the shooter to beat him . > But if you were to look at the 0-0 tie against the Habs , you saw a goalie > stand on his head to get that shutout . THAT was a # 1 goalie in action . Roussel > does n't have a game like that in him . I seem to remember Roussel doing an excellent job against Pittsurgh on opening night to give the Flyers a tie against the two-time defending champs . And not to take anything away from Soderstrom because he was senational in that game agains the Habs . But you ca n't tell me that a Montreal player had an open net to shoot at some point during that game and just flat out missed it . Mistakes , both on offense and defense are part of the game . Or there 'd never be shutouts . Anyway , I 'm happy the Flyers have both Soderstrom and Roussel and I 'm not going to argue about it anymore . Besides , with the current 7-game winning streak and expectations soaring for next year , I do n't want to piss you off to the point that you do n't sell me any tickets next season : - ) . \ \ Joe Dakes \/\ AT & T Microelectronics \/\ 555 Union Boulevard \ \ Allentown , PA 18103 LET 'S GO FLYERS ! alux1 ! jmd \ \ jmd @ aluxpo.att.com \ \__________ \____/_//__/

There is no question that orally administered doses of MSG are capable of destroying nearly all neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and the median eminence . These areas are responsible for the production of hormones critical to normal neuroendocrine function and the normal development of the vertabrate organism . Humans are vertebrates . Now what , pray tell , do you think will happen when the area of the brain necessary for the normal rhythm of gonadotropin release is missing ? Are you trying to say that humans have no need of their pituitary , ANH , and ME , of that part of the brain that is responsible for controlling the realease ( albeit indirectly ) of estradiol and testosterone ? How do you expect anyone to do the studies on this ? It 's unethical to '' sacrifice '' humans to check out what effects chronic , acute , etc doses of these compounds are having on the brain tissue in humans . The food industry knows this . That 's why the animal model is used in medicine and psych . If you 're talking about straight sensitivity , it would be useful to define the term . There are plenty of studies on psychoneuroimmunology showing the link between attitude and physiology . I suspect we may be arguing about separate things ; *only* adult sensitivities ( You ) , and late-occuring sequelae of childhood ingestion and its implication for adults ( me ) . Certainly the doses for excitotoxicity in adults are considerably larger than for the young , but the additivity of Glu and Asp , and their copious and increased presence in modern processed foods ( jointly ) , and their hidden presence in HVP , necessitates extreme caution . Why would anyone want to eat compounds which have been shown to markedly perturb the endocrine system in adults ? The main point is *blood levels* attained , and oral doses would likely have to be greater than SC . > > Between who ? Over what ?

Terry , Epelbaum and Martin have shown that orally administered MSG causes changes in normal gonadotropic hormone fluctutations in adults . Glu also was found to induce immediate and persistant supression of rhythmic GH secretion , and to induce rapid and transient release of prolactin in adults chronically exposed to MSG . GH is responsible not only for control of growth during development , but also converts glycogen into glucose . Could this be the cause of headaches ?

Matthew Wiener ( weemba @ libra.wistar.upenn.edu ) contributed the section on Voyager , and the section on Sakigake was obtained from ISAS material posted by Yoshiro Yamada ( yamada @ yscvax.ysc.go.jp ) . US PLANETARY MISSIONS MARINER ( VENUS , MARS , & MERCURY FLYBYS AND ORBITERS ) MARINER 1 , the first U.S. attempt to send a spacecraft to Venus , failed minutes after launch in 1962 . The guidance instructions from the ground stopped reaching the rocket due to a problem with its antenna , so the onboard computer took control . However , there turned out to be a bug in the guidance software , and the rocket promptly went off course , so the Range Safety Officer destroyed it . Although the bug is sometimes claimed to have been an incorrect FORTRAN DO statement , it was actually a transcription error in which the bar ( indicating smoothing ) was omitted from the expression `` R-dot-bar sub n '' ( nth smoothed value of derivative of radius ) . This error led the software to treat normal minor variations of velocity as if they were serious , leading to incorrect compensation . MARINER 2 became the first successful probe to flyby Venus in December of 1962 , and it returned information which confirmed that Venus is a very hot ( 800 degrees Fahrenheit , now revised to 900 degrees F. ) world with a cloud-covered atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide ( sulfuric acid was later confirmed in 1978 ) . MARINER 3 , launched on November 5 , 1964 , was lost when its protective shroud failed to eject as the craft was placed into interplanetary space . Unable to collect the Sun 's energy for power from its solar panels , the probe soon died when its batteries ran out and is now in solar orbit . It was intended for a Mars flyby with MARINER 4 . MARINER 4 , the sister probe to MARINER 3 , did reach Mars in 1965 and took the first close-up images of the Martian surface ( 22 in all ) as it flew by the planet . The probe found a cratered world with an atmosphere much thinner than previously thought . Many scientists concluded from this preliminary scan that Mars was a `` dead '' world in both the geological and biological sense . MARINER 5 was sent to Venus in 1967 . It reconfirmed the data on that planet collected five years earlier by MARINER 2 , plus the information that Venus ' atmospheric pressure at its surface is at least 90 times that of Earth 's , or the equivalent of being 3,300 feet under the surface of an ocean . MARINER 6 and 7 were sent to Mars in 1969 and expanded upon the work done by MARINER 4 four years earlier . However , they failed to take away the concept of Mars as a `` dead '' planet , first made from the basic measurements of MARINER 4 . MARINER 8 ended up in the Atlantic Ocean in 1971 when the rocket launcher autopilot failed . MARINER 9 , the sister probe to MARINER 8 , became the first craft to orbit Mars in 1971 . It returned information on the Red Planet that no other probe had done before , revealing huge volcanoes on the Martian surface , as well as giant canyon systems , and evidence that water once flowed across the planet . The probe also took the first detailed closeup images of Mars ' two small moons , Phobos and Deimos . MARINER 10 used Venus as a gravity assist to Mercury in 1974 . The probe did return the first close-up images of the Venusian atmosphere in ultraviolet , revealing previously unseen details in the cloud cover , plus the fact that the entire cloud system circles the planet in four Earth days . MARINER 10 eventually made three flybys of Mercury from 1974 to 1975 before running out of attitude control gas . The probe revealed Mercury as a heavily cratered world with a mass much greater than thought . This would seem to indicate that Mercury has an iron core which makes up 75 percent of the entire planet . PIONEER ( MOON , SUN , VENUS , JUPITER , and SATURN FLYBYS AND ORBITERS ) PIONEER 1 through 3 failed to meet their main objective - to photograph the Moon close-up - but they did reach far enough into space to provide new information on the area between Earth and the Moon , including new data on the Van Allen radiation belts circling Earth . All three craft had failures with their rocket launchers . PIONEER 1 was launched on October 11 , 1958 , PIONEER 2 on November 8 , and PIONEER 3 on December 6 . PIONEER 4 was a Moon probe which missed the Moon and became the first U.S. spacecraft to orbit the Sun in 1959 . PIONEER 5 was originally designed to flyby Venus , but the mission was scaled down and it instead studied the interplanetary environment between Venus and Earth out to 36.2 million kilometers in 1960 , a record until MARINER 2 . PIONEER 6 through 9 were placed into solar orbit from 1965 to 1968 : PIONEER 6 , 7 , and 8 are still transmitting information at this time . PIONEER E ( would have been number 10 ) suffered a launch failure in 1969 . PIONEER 10 became the first spacecraft to flyby Jupiter in 1973 . PIONEER 11 followed it in 1974 , and then went on to become the first probe to study Saturn in 1979 . Both vehicles should continue to function through 1995 and are heading off into interstellar space , the first craft ever to do so . PIONEER Venus 1 ( 1978 ) ( also known as PIONEER Venus Orbiter , or PIONEER 12 ) burned up in the Venusian atmosphere on October 8 , 1992 . PVO made the first radar studies of the planet 's surface via probe . PIONEER Venus 2 ( also known as PIONEER 13 ) sent four small probes into the atmosphere in December of 1978 . The main spacecraft bus burned up high in the atmosphere , while the four probes descended by parachute towards the surface . Though none were expected to survive to the surface , the Day probe did make it and transmitted for 67.5 minutes on the ground before its batteries failed . RANGER ( LUNAR LANDER AND IMPACT MISSIONS ) RANGER 1 and 2 were test probes for the RANGER lunar impact series . They were meant for high Earth orbit testing in 1961 , but rocket problems left them in useless low orbits which quickly decayed . RANGER 3 , launched on January 26 , 1962 , was intended to land an instrument capsule on the surface of the Moon , but problems during the launch caused the probe to miss the Moon and head into solar orbit . RANGER 3 did try to take some images of the Moon as it flew by , but the camera was unfortunately aimed at deep space during the attempt . RANGER 4 , launched April 23 , 1962 , had the same purpose as RANGER 3 , but suffered technical problems enroute and crashed on the lunar farside , the first U.S. probe to reach the Moon , albeit without returning data . RANGER 5 , launched October 18 , 1962 and similar to RANGER 3 and 4 , lost all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually missed the Moon and drifted off into solar orbit . RANGER 6 through 9 had more modified lunar missions : They were to send back live images of the lunar surface as they headed towards an impact with the Moon . RANGER 6 failed this objective in 1964 when its cameras did not operate . RANGER 7 through 9 performed well , becoming the first U.S. lunar probes to return thousands of lunar images through 1965 . LUNAR ORBITER ( LUNAR SURFACE PHOTOGRAPHY ) LUNAR ORBITER 1 through 5 were designed to orbit the Moon and image various sites being studied as landing areas for the manned APOLLO missions of 1969-1972 . The probes also contributed greatly to our understanding of lunar surface features , particularly the lunar farside . All five probes of the series , launched from 1966 to 1967 , were essentially successful in their missions . They were the first U.S. probes to orbit the Moon . All LOs were eventually crashed into the lunar surface to avoid interference with the manned APOLLO missions . SURVEYOR ( LUNAR SOFT LANDERS ) The SURVEYOR series were designed primarily to see if an APOLLO lunar module could land on the surface of the Moon without sinking into the soil ( before this time , it was feared by some that the Moon was covered in great layers of dust , which would not support a heavy landing vehicle ) . SURVEYOR was successful in proving that the lunar surface was strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from 1966 to 1968 . Only SURVEYOR 2 and 4 were unsuccessful missions . The rest became the first U.S. probes to soft land on the Moon , taking thousands of images and scooping the soil for analysis . APOLLO 12 landed 600 feet from SURVEYOR 3 in 1969 and returned parts of the craft to Earth . SURVEYOR 7 , the last of the series , was a purely scientific mission which explored the Tycho crater region in 1968 . VIKING ( MARS ORBITERS AND LANDERS ) VIKING 1 was launched from Cape Canaveral , Florida on August 20 , 1975 on a TITAN 3E-CENTAUR D1 rocket . The probe went into Martian orbit on June 19 , 1976 , and the lander set down on the western slopes of Chryse Planitia on July 20 , 1976 . It soon began its programmed search for Martian micro-organisms ( there is still debate as to whether the probes found life there or not ) , and sent back incredible color panoramas of its surroundings . One thing scientists learned was that Mars ' sky was pinkish in color , not dark blue as they originally thought ( the sky is pink due to sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particles in the thin atmosphere ) . The lander set down among a field of red sand and boulders stretching out as far as its cameras could image . The VIKING 1 orbiter kept functioning until August 7 , 1980 , when it ran out of attitude-control propellant . The lander was switched into a weather-reporting mode , where it had been hoped it would keep functioning through 1994 ; but after November 13 , 1982 , an errant command had been sent to the lander accidentally telling it to shut down until further orders . Communication was never regained again , despite the engineers ' efforts through May of 1983 . An interesting side note : VIKING 1 's lander has been designated the Thomas A. Mutch Memorial Station in honor of the late leader of the lander imaging team . The National Air and Space Museum in Washington , D.C. is entrusted with the safekeeping of the Mutch Station Plaque until it can be attached to the lander by a manned expedition . VIKING 2 was launched on September 9 , 1975 , and arrived in Martian orbit on August 7 , 1976 . The lander touched down on September 3 , 1976 in Utopia Planitia . It accomplished essentially the same tasks as its sister lander , with the exception that its seisometer worked , recording one marsquake . The orbiter had a series of attitude-control gas leaks in 1978 , which prompted it being shut down that July . The lander was shut down on April 12 , 1980 . The orbits of both VIKING orbiters should decay around 2025 . VOYAGER ( OUTER PLANET FLYBYS ) VOYAGER 1 was launched September 5 , 1977 , and flew past Jupiter on March 5 , 1979 and by Saturn on November 13 , 1980 . VOYAGER 2 was launched August 20 , 1977 ( before VOYAGER 1 ) , and flew by Jupiter on August 7 , 1979 , by Saturn on August 26 , 1981 , by Uranus on January 24 , 1986 , and by Neptune on August 8 , 1989 . VOYAGER 2 took advantage of a rare once-every-189-years alignment to slingshot its way from outer planet to outer planet . VOYAGER 1 could , in principle , have headed towards Pluto , but JPL opted for the sure thing of a Titan close up . Between the two probes , our knowledge of the 4 giant planets , their satellites , and their rings has become immense . VOYAGER 1 & 2 discovered that Jupiter has complicated atmospheric dynamics , lightning and aurorae . Three new satellites were discovered . Two of the major surprises were that Jupiter has rings and that Io has active sulfurous volcanoes , with major effects on the Jovian magnetosphere . When the two probes reached Saturn , they discovered over 1000 ringlets and 7 satellites , including the predicted shepherd satellites that keep the rings stable . The weather was tame compared with Jupiter : massive jet streams with minimal variance ( a 33-year great white spot/band cycle is known ) . Titan 's atmosphere was smoggy . Mimas ' appearance was startling : one massive impact crater gave it the Death Star appearance . The big surprise here was the stranger aspects of the rings . Braids , kinks , and spokes were both unexpected and difficult to explain . VOYAGER 2 , thanks to heroic engineering and programming efforts , continued the mission to Uranus and Neptune . Uranus itself was highly monochromatic in appearance . One oddity was that its magnetic axis was found to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational axis , giving Uranus a peculiar magnetosphere . Icy channels were found on Ariel , and Miranda was a bizarre patchwork of different terrains . 10 satellites and one more ring were discovered . In contrast to Uranus , Neptune was found to have rather active weather , including numerous cloud features . The ring arcs turned out to be bright patches on one ring . Two other rings , and 6 other satellites , were discovered . Neptune 's magnetic axis was also skewed . Triton had a canteloupe appearance and geysers . ( What 's liquid at 38K ? ) The two VOYAGERs are expected to last for about two more decades . Their on-target journeying gives negative evidence about possible planets beyond Pluto . Their next major scientific discovery should be the location of the heliopause . SOVIET PLANETARY MISSIONS Since there have been so many Soviet probes to the Moon , Venus , and Mars , I will highlight only the primary missions : SOVIET LUNAR PROBES LUNA 1 - Lunar impact attempt in 1959 , missed Moon and became first craft in solar orbit . LUNA 2 - First craft to impact on lunar surface in 1959 . LUNA 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1959 . ZOND 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1965 since LUNA 3 . Was also a test for future Mars missions . LUNA 9 - First probe to soft land on the Moon in 1966 , returned images from surface . LUNA 10 - First probe to orbit the Moon in 1966 . LUNA 13 - Second successful Soviet lunar soft landing mission in 1966 . ZOND 5 - First successful circumlunar craft . ZOND 6 through 8 accomplished similar missions through 1970 . The probes were unmanned tests of a manned orbiting SOYUZ-type lunar vehicle . LUNA 16 - First probe to land on Moon and return samples of lunar soil to Earth in 1970 . LUNA 20 accomplished similar mission in 1972 . LUNA 17 - Delivered the first unmanned lunar rover to the Moon's surface , LUNOKHOD 1 , in 1970 . A similar feat was accomplished with LUNA 21/LUNOKHOD 2 in 1973 . LUNA 24 - Last Soviet lunar mission to date . Returned soil samples in 1976 . SOVIET VENUS PROBES VENERA 1 - First acknowledged attempt at Venus mission . Transmissions lost enroute in 1961 . VENERA 2 - Attempt to image Venus during flyby mission in tandem with VENERA 3 . Probe ceased transmitting just before encounter in February of 1966 . No images were returned . VENERA 3 - Attempt to place a lander capsule on Venusian surface . Transmissions ceased just before encounter and entire probe became the first craft to impact on another planet in 1966 . VENERA 4 - First probe to successfully return data while descending through Venusian atmosphere . Crushed by air pressure before reaching surface in 1967 . VENERA 5 and 6 mission profiles similar in 1969 . VENERA 7 - First probe to return data from the surface of another planet in 1970 . VENERA 8 accomplished a more detailed mission in 1972 . VENERA 9 - Sent first image of Venusian surface in 1975 . Was also the first probe to orbit Venus . VENERA 10 accomplished similar mission . VENERA 13 - Returned first color images of Venusian surface in 1982 . VENERA 14 accomplished similar mission . VENERA 15 - Accomplished radar mapping with VENERA 16 of sections of planet 's surface in 1983 more detailed than PVO . VEGA 1 - Accomplished with VEGA 2 first balloon probes of Venusian atmosphere in 1985 , including two landers . Flyby buses went on to become first spacecraft to study Comet Halley close-up in March of 1986 . SOVIET MARS PROBES MARS 1 - First acknowledged Mars probe in 1962 . Transmissions ceased enroute the following year . ZOND 2 - First possible attempt to place a lander capsule on Martian surface . Probe signals ceased enroute in 1965 . MARS 2 - First Soviet Mars probe to land - albeit crash - on Martian surface . Orbiter section first Soviet probe to circle the Red Planet in 1971 . MARS 3 - First successful soft landing on Martian surface , but lander signals ceased after 90 seconds in 1971 . MARS 4 - Attempt at orbiting Mars in 1974 , braking rockets failed to fire , probe went on into solar orbit . MARS 5 - First fully successful Soviet Mars mission , orbiting Mars in 1974 . Returned images of Martian surface comparable to U.S. probe MARINER 9 . MARS 6 - Landing attempt in 1974 . Lander crashed into the surface . MARS 7 - Lander missed Mars completely in 1974 , went into a solar orbit with its flyby bus . PHOBOS 1 - First attempt to land probes on surface of Mars ' largest moon , Phobos . Probe failed enroute in 1988 due to human/computer error . PHOBOS 2 - Attempt to land probes on Martian moon Phobos . The probe did enter Mars orbit in early 1989 , but signals ceased one week before scheduled Phobos landing . While there has been talk of Soviet Jupiter , Saturn , and even interstellar probes within the next thirty years , no major steps have yet been taken with these projects . More intensive studies of the Moon , Mars , Venus , and various comets have been planned for the 1990s , and a Mercury mission to orbit and land probes on the tiny world has been planned for 2003 . How the many changes in the former Soviet Union ( now the Commonwealth of Independent States ) will affect the future of their space program remains to be seen . JAPANESE PLANETARY MISSIONS SAKIGAKE ( MS-T5 ) was launched from the Kagoshima Space Center by ISAS on January 8 1985 , and approached Halley 's Comet within about 7 million km on March 11 , 1986 . The spacecraft is carrying three instru- ments to measure interplanetary magnetic field/plasma waves/solar wind , all of which work normally now , so ISAS made an Earth swingby by Sakigake on January 8 , 1992 into an orbit similar to the earth 's . The closest approach was at 23h08m47s ( JST=UTC+9h ) on January 8 , 1992 . The geocentric distance was 88,997 km . This is the first planet-swingby for a Japanese spacecraft . During the approach , Sakigake observed the geotail . Some geotail passages will be scheduled in some years hence . The second Earth-swingby will be on June 14 , 1993 ( at 40 Re ( Earth 's radius ) ) , and the third October 28 , 1994 ( at 86 Re ) . HITEN , a small lunar probe , was launched into Earth orbit on January 24 , 1990 . The spacecraft was then known as MUSES-A , but was renamed to Hiten once in orbit . The 430 lb probe looped out from Earth and made its first lunary flyby on March 19 , where it dropped off its 26 lb midget satellite , HAGOROMO . Japan at this point became the third nation to orbit a satellite around the Moon , joining the Unites States and USSR . The smaller spacecraft , Hagoromo , remained in orbit around the Moon . An apparently broken transistor radio caused the Japanese space scientists to lose track of it . Hagoromo 's rocket motor fired on schedule on March 19 , but the spacecraft 's tracking transmitter failed immediately . The rocket firing of Hagoromo was optically confirmed using the Schmidt camera ( 105-cm , F3.1 ) at the Kiso Observatory in Japan . Hiten made multiple lunar flybys at approximately monthly intervals and performed aerobraking experiments using the Earth 's atmosphere . Hiten made a close approach to the moon at 22:33 JST ( UTC+9h ) on February 15 , 1992 at the height of 423 km from the moon 's surface ( 35.3N , 9.7E ) and fired its propulsion system for about ten minutes to put the craft into lunar orbit . The following is the orbital calculation results after the approach : Apoapsis Altitude : about 49,400 km Periapsis Altitude : about 9,600 km Inclination : 34.7 deg ( to ecliptic plane ) Period : 4.7 days PLANETARY MISSION REFERENCES I also recommend reading the following works , categorized in three groups : General overviews , specific books on particular space missions , and periodical sources on space probes . This list is by no means complete ; it is primarily designed to give you places to start your research through generally available works on the subject . If anyone can add pertinent works to the list , it would be greatly appreciated . Though naturally I recommend all the books listed below , I think it would be best if you started out with the general overview books , in order to give you a clear idea of the history of space exploration in this area . I also recommend that you pick up some good , up-to-date general works on astronomy and the Sol system , to give you some extra background . Most of these books and periodicals can be found in any good public and university library . Some of the more recently published works can also be purchased in and/or ordered through any good mass- market bookstore . General Overviews ( in alphabetical order by author ) : J.

TIME , NEWSWEEK , and various major newspapers can supply not only general information on certain missions , but also show you what else was going on with Earth at the time events were unfolding , if that is of interest to you . Space missions are affected by numerous political , economic , and climatic factors , as you probably know . Depending on just how far your interest in space probes will go , you might also wish to join The Planetary Society , one of the largest space groups in the world dedicated to planetary exploration . Their periodical , THE PLANETARY REPORT , details the latest space probe missions . Write to The Planetary Society , 65 North Catalina Avenue , Pasadena , California 91106 USA . Good luck with your studies in this area of space exploration . I personally find planetary missions to be one of the more exciting areas in this field , and the benefits human society has and will receive from it are incredible , with many yet to be realized .

In fact , be- fore BATSE , having this widely separated `` Interplanetary Network '' was the only sure way to locate a random burst . With only one detector , one can not locate a burst ( except to say `` It 's somewhere in the field of view. '' ) . With two detectors , one can use the time that the burst is seen in each detector to narrow the location to a thin annulus on the sky . With three detectors , one gets intersecting annuli , giving two possible locations . If one of these locations is impossible ( because , say , the Earth blocked that part of the sky ) , voila , you have an error box . BATSE , by having 8 detectors of its own , can do its own location determination , but only to within about 3 degrees ( would someone at GSFC , like David , like to comment on the current state of location determination ? ) . Having inde- pendent sightings by other detectors helps drive down the uncertainty . You did touch on something that you did n't mean to , though . Some believe ( in a reference that I have somewhere ) that absorption-like features seen in a fraction of GRBs can actually be caused by the detector . It would be a mean , nasty God , though , that would have a NaI crystal act like a 10^12 Gauss neutron star ... but this is getting too far afield . Peter peterf @ oddjob.uchicago.edu

It is a fact that the inhabitants of Gaza are not entitled to a normal civlized life . They habe been kept under occupation by Israel since 1967 without civil and political rights . It is a fact that Gazans live in their own country , Palestine . Gaza is not a foriegn country . Nor is TelAviv , Jaffa , Askalon , BeerSheba foreign country for Gazans . All these places are occupied as far as Palestinians are concerned and as far as common sense has it . It is a fact that Zionists deny Gazans equal rights as Israeli citizens and the right to determine by themsevles their government . When Zionists will begin to consider Gazans as human beings who deserve the same rights as themselves , there will be hope for peace . Not before . Somebody mentioned that Gaza is 'foreign country ' and therefore Israel is entitled to close its borders to Gaza . In this case , Gaza should be entitled to reciprocate , and deny Israeli civilians and military personnel to enter the area . As the relation is not symmetrical , but that of a master and slave , the label 'foreign country ' is inaccurate and misleading . To close off 700,000 people in the Strip , deny them means of subsistence and means of defending themselves , is a collective punishment and a crime . It is neither justifiable nor legal . It just reflects the abyss to which Israeli society has degraded . I would like to ask any of those who heap foul langauge on me to explain why Israel denies Gazans who were born and brought up in Jaffa to return and live there ? Would they be allowed to , if they converted to Judaism ? Is their right to live in their former town depdendent upon their religion or ethnic origin ? Please give an honest answer . Elias

You 're assuming that the low-cost delivery system has to be a separate project . But why ? If you are spending hundreds of millions of dollars in hopes of winning a billion-dollar prize , it is *cheaper* to develop your own launch system , charging its entire development cost against your contest entry , than to try to do it with existing launchers .

You 're assuming that it 's going to take a decade to build a new launch system . But why ? The Saturn V took less than six years , depending on exactly when you date its start . Pegasus took about three from project start to first flight . Before SDIO chickened out on orbital development , the target date for an orbital DC-Y flight was 1996 . If you really want speed , consider that the first prototypes of the Thor missile ( still in service as the core of the Delta launcher ) shipped to the USAF less than 18 months after the development go-ahead . One of the most pernicious myths in this whole business is the belief that you ca n't build a launcher without taking ten years and spending billions of dollars . It is n't true and never was .

As you point out , the experiments would be difficult . But we know enough about the physics of the situation to do some calculations . There are in fact three effects contributing to leaning the bike over to begin a turn . 1 . Gyro effect causing a torque which twists the bike over . 2 . Contact patch having shifted to one side , causing bike to fall over . 3 . Contact patch being accelerated to the side , causing a torque which twists the bike over . Take an average bike/rider , average bike wheel , and at speeds of 5 , 15 , and 50 mph ( say ) calculate how much twist of the bars would be needed to produce ( say ) 20 degrees of lean in ( say ) 2 seconds by each effect alone . My guess is that at slow speeds 2 is dominant , and at high speeds 3 is dominant , and at all speeds 1 contributes not far off bugger all , relatively speaking . By the way , a similar problem is this : how does a runner who wants to run round a corner get leaned into the corner fast ? Is there a running group where we could start `` counter-footing '' arguments and have them all falling over as they tried to work out how they go round corners ? -- Chris Malcolm cam @ uk.ac.ed.aifh +44 ( 0 ) 31 650 3085 Department of Artificial Intelligence , Edinburgh University 5 Forrest Hill , Edinburgh , EH1 2QL , UK DoD # 205

( 818 ) 354-5011 Contact : Mary A. Hardin FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE April 15 , 1993 # 1506 Scientists at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory report the successful flight of a balloon carrying instruments designed to measure and study chemicals in the Earth 's ozone layer . The April 3 flight from California 's Barstow/Daggett Airport reached an altitude of 37 kilometers ( 121,000 feet ) and took measurements as part of a program established to correlate data with the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite ( UARS ) . The data from the balloon flight will also be compared to readings from the Atmospheric Trace Molecular Spectroscopy ( ATMOS ) experiment which is currently flying onboard the shuttle Discovery . `` We launch these balloons several times a year as part of an ongoing ozone research program . In fact , JPL is actively involved in the study of ozone and the atmosphere in three important ways , '' said Dr. Jim Margitan , principal investigator on the balloon research campaign . `` There are two JPL instruments on the UARS satellite , '' he continued . `` The ATMOS experiment is conducted by JPL scientists , and the JPL balloon research provides collaborative ground truth for those activities , as well as data that is useful in its own right . '' The measurements taken by the balloon payload will add more pieces to the complex puzzle of the atmosphere , specifically the mid-latitude stratosphere during winter and spring . Understanding the chemistry occurring in this region helps scientists construct more accurate computer models which are instrumental in predicting future ozone conditions . The scientific balloon payload consisted of three JPL instruments : an ultraviolet ozone photometer which measures ozone as the balloon ascends and descends through the atmosphere ; a submillimeterwave limb sounder which looks at microwave radiation emitted by molecules in the atmosphere ; and a Fourier transform infrared interferometer which monitors how the atmosphere absorbs sunlight . Launch occurred at about noontime , and following a three- hour ascent , the balloon floated eastward at approximately 130 kilometers per hour ( 70 knots ) . Data was radioed to ground stations and recorded onboard . The flight ended at 10 p.m. Pacific time in eastern New Mexico when the payload was commanded to separate from the balloon . `` We needed to fly through sunset to make the infrared measurements , '' Margitan explained , `` and we also needed to fly in darkness to watch how quickly some of the molecules disappear . '' It will be several weeks before scientists will have the completed results of their experiments . They will then forward their data to the UARS central data facility at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Maryland for use by the UARS scientists . The balloon was launched by the National Scientific Balloon Facility , normally based in Palestine , Tex. , operating under a contract from NASA 's Wallops Flight Facility . The balloon was launched in California because of the west-to-east wind direction and the desire to keep the operation in the southwest . The balloons are made of 20-micron ( 0.8 mil , or less than one-thousandth of an inch ) thick plastic , and are 790,000 cubic meters ( 28 million cubic feet ) in volume when fully inflated with helium ( 120 meters ( 400 feet ) in diameter ) . The balloons weigh between 1,300 and 1,800 kilograms ( 3,000 and 4,000 pounds ) . The scientific payload weighs about 1,300 kilograms ( 3,000 ) pounds and is 1.8 meters ( six feet ) square by 4.6 meters ( 15 feet ) high . The JPL balloon research is sponsored by NASA 's Upper Atmosphere Research Program and the UARS Correlative Measurements Program . # # # # # ___ _____ ___ /_ /| /____/ \ /_ /| Ron Baalke | baalke @ kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov | | | | __ \ /| | | | Jet Propulsion Lab | ___| | | | |__ ) |/ | | |__ M/S 525-3684 Telos | Being cynical never helps /___| | | | ___/ | |/__ /| Pasadena , CA 91109 | to correct the situation |_____|/ |_|/ |_____|/ | and causes more aggravation | instead .
From : don @ hunan.rastek.com ( Donald Owen Newbold ) Subject : Re : ATM ... == > Now HPLJ 4 Pricing Organization : Rastek Corporation , Huntsville , AL Lines : 41 While there are too many PS clones to count , some of which are quite poor , trying to clone something that goes through regular modifications does require some patience . Three questions come to mid real quick for something like this . Q : Which version of Adobe PS will we clone ? Aside from the level 1 and level 2 issues , Adobe has in the past released new code that incorporates modifications/upgrades/fixes just as all other software vendors do . The level 2 stuff may seem sound now , but I assure you , changes will become more frequent as their customer list begins to dwindle in the face of competition . This allows them to shift people to maintenance , as well as design efforts for level 3 . Q : Do we duplicate the bugs , or do we make it work correctly ? From the LaserWriter to the LaserJet 4 there have been bugs . ( If I had a number to call at HP or Adobe , they'ld have heard from me . ) Deciding which approach to take depends on which printer you want to emulate . Q : Do we follow the Red Book , or do we follow someone 's implementation ? Without a doubt , there are differences between the Red Book and Adobe's PS . With level 2 many issues have been refined but the Red Book does leave big , big holes in the implementation specific stuff . It would be nice it the Red Bood at least pined things down enough so that two different implementations of Adobe 's PS do n't do the exact opposite given an identical set of conditions . Q : PSCRIPT.DRV ? Having done a lot of PS clone testing myself , the unfortunate side of testing is the limited number of sources for test files . The primary source we use is Genoa . And having characterizes their 1992 PS ATS files , ( 1300+ of them ) over half are taken from PSCRIPT.DRV . It may not ideal , but the ATS files are what the printer vendors use . I 'm sure that Adobe uses them too , but Adobe 's output is by definition correct , even if its wrong . Yes , there are some very poor clones . We 've seen them here at Rastek ( a sub of Genicom which has its own clone called GeniScript ) . Some are poor for lack of design , some are poor because they followed the Red Book , and some are poor because the vendors do n't know what PS is . Don Newbold don @ rastek.com

Adding a bit to the key doubles the amount of work to be done in a straight brute-force attack , where you try every single possible key until one works . Processing and storage requirements for this kind of attack on a 128-bit key seem like they ought to make it effectively impossible . However , there may be other attacks whose difficulty is ( for example ) proportional to , say , 2**sqrt ( n ) , or some such . Also , a long key does you little good if there is a way to incrementally guess a little of the key at a time ... . > Thanks , > Dane -- John

They could have beaten us if either : * Their rocket had n't blown up on the pad thus setting them back , and/or * A Saturn V went boom . If they had beaten us , I speculate that the US would have gone head and done some landings , but we also would have been more determined to set up a base ( both in Earth Orbit and on the Moon ) . Whether or not we would be on Mars by now would depend upon whether the Soviets tried to go .

I 've heard that RC2 can be scaled to arbitrarily > large keys , but is this actually implemented anywhere ? My MDC cipher ( which uses any one-way hash function as a CFB-mode stream cipher , the current implementation uses MD5 ) uses a key of up to 2048 bits ( that is , you can use a 1-bit key if you want and copy it over the entire 2048-bit range , or you can use the entire 2048 bits ) . Runtime is independant of key size , the system runs slightly slower than MD5 itself . I presume RC2 and RC4 use a similar system ( or possibly they just hash an arbitrary-length key down to n bits , maybe 128 , using something like MD5 ) . Peter .

The Bible IS Truth ; it does not just contain truth . IMHO , if you trust your salvation on the reliability of a single book , you are on weak ground .

I think it 's safe to say that Hell was never intended metaphorical . Certainly not the equivalent of ceasing to exist . Some christian concepts are indeed metaphors , but your idea of Hell is a 20th century interpretation . It is , of course , nice to see that even christianity might evolve to fit the worldview of modern age , but I fear the church will not accept it .

I 've used 3D Concepts a little and it seems that the points are stored in the order they are drawn . Does the DXF format have a way of indicating which order the points are stored in , CW or CCW ? Its easy enough to convert , but if I do n't know which way they are stored , I dont know which direction the polygon should be visible from . If DXF does n't handle this , can anyone recommend a workaround ? The best I can think of is to create two polygons for each one in the DXF file , one stored CW and the other CCW .

I suppose that the most likely reason the algorythm is remaining secret for the moment is that some idiot bureaucrat , untrammeled by the realities of the situation , decided that '' well , we should keep it a secret because it is supposed to be secret , is n't it ?

'' -Avetik Issahakian by Yuri Danilov Some years ago Journalists interviewing celebrities liked to ask them : `` What books would you take with you if you were to go off on a space flight ? '' And though the number of books allowed on the trip varied from 10 to 30 , depending on the type of spacecraft and the generosity of the interviewer , and celebrities are people of the most varied tastes , ages , and professions , not one of them dared to say that he or she would want to take with them at least one book of arithmetic problems . Some of these people certainly excluded this kind of literature because they were trained in the humanities and had nothing but scorn for `` numbers '' ( though secretly afraid of them ) . Others steered clear of such puzzle books because they were masters of incomparably more difficult branches of modern mathematics and did n't mind saying for all the world to hear that they did n't know how to solve mere arithmetic problems . Professional mathematicians were no exception . Here 's what the Russian mathematician Alexander Khinchin , a specialist in statistics , wrote about arithmetic : `` I willingly confess that any time a fifth-grader asked me to help solve an arithmetic problem , it was a hard work for me , and sometimes I failed completely . Of course , like most of my friends , I could easily solve the problem by the natural algebraic route -- constructing equations or sets of equations . But we were supposed to avoid using algebraic analysis at all costs ! . . . By the way , it 's a fact that is well known and oft repeated that , as a rule , neither high school graduates , nor students at teaching colleges , nor teachers beginning their careers ( nor , I must add , scientific researchers ) can solve arithmetic problems . It seems the only people in the world who are able to solve them are fifth-grade teachers . '' Now , I 'm not insisting that a book of arithmetic problems be included in the bookbag of anyone flying into space . But a sense of justice induces me to recommend one particular problem book , one that will satisfy the most fastidious taste and supply food for thought sufficient not only for a relatively short flight to the Moon but for a extended space voyage -- say , to Venus and back . One for the `` road '' They both took out the books they brought for the road . Kingsley glanced at the Royal Astronomer 's book and saw a bright cover with a group of cutthroats shooting at each other with revolvers . `` God knows what this kind of stuff leads to , '' thought Kingsley . The Royal Astronomer looked at Kingsley 's book and saw the History of Herodotus . `` Good Lord , next he 'll be reading Thucydides , '' thought the Royal Astronomer . -- Fred Hoyle , The Black Cloud The book I 'm talking about is n't very big , but its 24 problems constitute 24 elegant miniatures from seventh-century Armenia . Naive and wise at the same time , rich in striking detail and the bright coloration of the period , these problems are reminiscent of the reliefs on the famous monument of Armenian architecture , the church on the island of Akhtamar in Lake Van ( in what is now Turkey_ . They are as inseparable from the image of Armenia as the elegant letters of the Armenian alphabet , invented by Mesrop Mashtots , or the songs of Komitas , or the paintings of Saryan . An edition of these incredibly beautiful problems has long been a bibliographic rarity . It was published under the title Problems and Solutions of Vardapet [ 1 ] Anania of Shirak , Armenian Mathematician of the Seventh Century ( translated and published by I . A. Orbeli , Petrograd , 1918 ) . The abundance of close observations and wide-ranging information about the way of life and customs of that remote epoch when Anania of Shirak lived and worked have actually rendered a disservice to his problem book . For many years the book was known only to researchers in the humanities -- specialists in Armenian history who jealously guarded their treasure and would n't let just anyone see it . Even now , after research by K. P. Patkanov , the learned monk Father Kaloust , J.I . Orbeli , A. Abramyan , V. K. Chaloyan , and others has brought the works of Anania of Shirak to light in scholarly circles , the general reader remains ignorant of the very existence of this remarkable problem book . Vardapet Anania of Shirak Once fell in love with the art of calculation , I thought that no philosophical notion can be constructed without number , considering it the mother of all wisdom . -- Anania of Shirak Among ancient Armenian thinkers , Vardapet Anania of Shirak stands out because of the breadth of his interests and the unique mathematical orientation of his work . Some of his works have been preserved . In addition to the Problems and Solutions , the following tracts have found a special place in the estimation of scholars : On Weights and Measures , Cosmography and Calendrical Theory , and Armenian Geography of the Seventh Century A.D. ( the authorship of the last work was long attributed to another outstanding thinker of ancient Armenia , Movses of Khoren ) . In his autobiography , Anania of Shirak has this to say about himself : I , Anania of Shirak , having studied all the science of our Armenian land and having learned the Holy Scripture intimately , in the expression of the psalmist , `` every day I illuminated the eyes of my mind . '' Feeling myself lacking in the art of calculation , I came to the conclusion that it is fruitless to study philosophy , the mother of all sciences , without number . I could find in Armenia neither a man versed in philosophy nor books that explained the sciences . I therefore went to Greece and met in Theodosiople a man named Iliazar who was well versed in ecclesiastical works . He told me that in Forth Armenia [ 2 ] there lived a famous mathematician , Christosatur . I went this person and spent six months with him . But soon I noticed that Christosatur was a master not of all science but only of certain fragmentary facts . I then went to Constantinople , where I met acquaintances who told me : '' Why did you go so far , when much closer to us , in Trebizon , on the coast of Pontus [ 3 ] lives the Byzantine vardapet Tyukhik . He is full of wisdom , is known to kings , and knows Armenian literature . '' I asked them how they knew this . They answered : `` We saw ourselves that many people traveled long distances to become pupils of so learned a man . Indeed the archdeacon of the patriarchate of Constantinople , Philagrus , traveled with us , bringing many young persons to become pupils of Tyukhik . '' When I heard this , I expressed my gratitude to God , who had quenched the thirst of His slave . I went to Tyukhik at the monastery of St. Eugene and explained why I had come . He received me graciously and said : `` I praise Our Lord that He sent you to learn and to transplant science in the domain of St. Gregory ; I am glad that all your country will learn from me . I myself lived in Armenia for many years as a youth . Ignorance reigned there . '' Vardapet Tyukhik loved me as a son and shared all his thoughts with me . The Lord bestowed upon me His blessing : I completely assimilated the science of number , and with such success that my fellow students at the king 's court began to envy me . I spent eight years with Tyukhik and studied many books that had not been translated into our language . For the vardapet had an innumerable collection of books : secret and explicit , ecclesiastical and pagan , books on art , history , and medicine , books of chronologies . Why enumerate them by title ? In a word , there is no book that Tyukhik did not have . And he had such a gift from the Holy Spirit for translating that when he sat down to translate something from the Greek into Armenian , he did not struggle as other translators did , and the translation read as if the work were written in that language originally . Tyukhik told me how he had achieved such vast erudition and how he had learned the Armenian language . `` When I was young , '' he said , `` I lived in Trebizon , at the court of the military chief Ioannus Patricus , and for a long time , up to the accession of Mauritius to the throne I served as a military man in Armenia and learned your language and literature . During one attack by Persian troops on the Greeks , I was wounded and escaped to Antioch . I lost all my possessions . Praying to the Lord to heal my wounds , I made a promise : `` If You prolong my life , I shall dedicate it not to accumulating perishable treasures but to collecting treasures of knowledge . '' And the Lord heard my prayers . After I recovered I went to Jerusalem , and from there to Alexandria and Rome . Upon returning to Constantinople , I met a famous philosopher from Athens and studied with him for many years . After that I returned to my homeland and began to teach and instruct my people . '' After some years that philosopher died . Not finding a replacement for him , the king and his courtiers sent for Tyukhik and invited him to assume the teacher 's position . Tyukhik , citing the promise he made to God not to move far from the city , turned down the offer . But because of his wide leaning , people came streaming from all countries to study with him . And I , the most insignificant of all Armenians , having learned from him this powerful science , desired by kings , brought it to our country , supported by no one , obligated only to my own industry , God 's help , and the prayers of the Blessed Educator . And no one thanked me for my efforts . Problems and Solutions A half and one sixth and one nine-ninth of all the books were printed on verge ' ; one fifth and one two-hundred-eighty-fifth -- on rag paper ; one forty-fifth and one eight-hundred-fifty-fifth -- on vellum , and forty-five inscribed copies -- on Dutch paper . And so , find how many copies were printed in all . -- Imitation of Anania of Shirak A Latin proverb says habent sua fata libelli ( `` books have their own fate '' ) . The fate of Problems and Solutions by Anania of Shirak is quite amazing . The manuscripts of Anania 's book were preserved only because , according to Armenian historians , `` in ancient and medieval Armenia manuscripts were guarded from invaders , like weapons , and cherished , like one 's own children . '' Biding their time , the manuscripts lay in the Matenadaran , a renowned depository of ancient manuscripts ( now the Mesrop Mashtots Institute of Ancient Manuscripts ) . And its hour finally arrived . In 1896 the learned monk Father Kaloust used two manuscripts to publish the problem book , supplementing it with an introduction and commentary . In 1918 the book was translated into Russian , edited , annotated , and typeset by Iosef Orbeli , a prominent scholar ( and later a member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR ) . In the translator 's words , the problems of Anania are `` amusing , full of life , and simple . '' Orbeli goes on to say : `` The subjects of the problems are generally taken from everyday life . The scene is predominantly his homeland Shirak and the surrounding countryside , and the dramatis personae , if they are named , are the local princes -- the Kamsarakans , including Nersekh , who was a contemporary of Anania . '' Like other ancient authors , Anania of Shirak used only `` aliquots '' -- that is , fractions with a numerator of 1 . When it is necessary to write fractions with numerators other than 1 , one has to represent it as a sum of aliquots ( see the epigraph above ) . Like any true work of art , the problems of Anania suffer terribly in the retelling . You have to read the originals ( albeit in translation ) in their full glory . So let 's open Anania 's problem book -- a gift from across the ages . Problems 1 and 8 relate to the Armenian uprising against the Persians in A.D. 572 . Problem 1 My father told me the following story . During the famous wars between the Armenians and the Persians , prince Zaurak Kamsarakan performed extraordinary heroic deeds . Three times in a single month he attacked the Persian troops . The first time , he struck down half of the Persian army . The second time , pursuing the Persians , he slaughtered one fourth of the soldiers . The third time , he destroyed one eleventh of the Persian army . The Persians who were still alive , numbering two hundred eighty , fled to Nakhichevan . And so , from this remainder , find how many Persian soldiers there were before the massacre . Problem 8 During the famous Armenian uprising against the Persians , when Zaurak Kamsarakan killed Suren , one of the Armenian azats [ 4 ] sent an envoy to the Persian king to report the baleful news . The envoy covered fifty miles in a day . Fifteen days later , when he learned of this , Zaurak Kamsarakan sent riders in pursuit to bring the envoy back . The riders covered eighty miles in a day . And so , find how many days it took them to catch the envoy . Problem 18 mentions vessels made of varying amounts of metal . In the Russian translation , they are all called `` dishes . '' But in the original Armenian , according to Orbeli 's note , the dishes in the first and second instances are called mesur , and in the third instance scutel . Scutel is a common Armenian word , but mesur had not been encountered in Armenian literature before Anania 's Problems and Solutions . Problem 18 There was a tray in my house . I melted it down and made other vessels from the metal . From one third I made a mesur ; from one fourth , another mesur ; from one fifth , two goblets ; from one sixth , two scutels ; and from two hundred ten drams , I made a bowl . And now , find the weight of the tray . Several of the problems reflect the richness of the Caucasian fauna in Anania 's time -- for instance , problem 7 . Problem 7 Once I was in Marmet , the capital of the Kamsarakans . Strolling along the bank of the river Akhuryan , I saw a school of fish and ordered that a net be cast . We caught a half and a quarter of the school , and all the fishes that slipped out of the net ended up in a creel . When I looked in the creel , I found forty-five fishes . And now , find how many fishes here were in all . The temptation is great to present all 24 problems . But I 'll restrain myself and offer you just one more . Problem 20 provides some interesting information about the wild animals that inhabited Armenia at one time but now extinct for so long that there is no mention of them even in zoological reference books . The wild donkey , according to the generally accepted view , never roamed the Armenian lands . Yet Anania of Shirak offers evidence to the contrary . Problem 20 The hunting preserve of Nersekh Kamsarakan , ter [ 5 ] of Shirak and Asharunik , was at the base of the mountain called Artin . One night great herds of wild donkey entered the preserve . The hunters could not cope with the donkeys and , running to the village of Talin , told Nersekh about them . When he arrived with his brothers and azats and entered the preserve , they began killing the wild beasts . Half of the animals were caught in traps , one fourth were killed by arrows . The young , which constituted one twelfth of all the animals , were caught alive , and three hundred sixty wild donkeys were killed by spears . And so , find how many beasts there were at the start of this massacre . `` Set in type by me , Iosef Orbeli '' His biography could not be squeezed into the framework of a bibliography . -- K Uzbashyan , Academician Iosef Abgarovich Orbeli Anyone who is lucky enough to hold a copy ( 1/n of the small printing -- n is the solution to the epigraph in the previous section ) of the Russian translation of Anania of Shirak 's Problems and Solutions , a thin book with yellowed pages , has probably noticed the variety of the fonts , the elegance of the borders , and the high quality of the design , printing , and binding . Such great attention to detail is characteristic of works that fulfill a requirement for a degree in bookmaking . And this problem book was indeed a kind of diploma attesting to the professional maturity of the man who created it . An advertisement at the end of the book reads : `` This book was typeset in December 1917 at the printing offices of the Russian Academy of Sciences by me , Iosef Orbeli ; the text was also proofread , laid out , and decorated with borders by me . Various circumstances prevented me from carrying this project to the end ; the final pages of the book were typeset by M . Strolman . '' Typesetting was neither the first nor the only profession of the renowned orientalist Iosef Orbeli , who later became the director of the Hermitage Museum in Leningrad . He was also a cabinetmaker and a locksmith . Orbeli had already become acquainted with the famous academic printing house Typis Academiae , founded in 1728 and known all over the scientific world for its rich collection of fonts and its virtuoso typesetters . In preparing to publish the corpus of ancient inscriptions preserved on the walls of Armenian churches , Orbeli found it necessary to create a new font that would preserve the unique signs and ligatures . This complicated work was done by M. G. Strolman . ( Unfortunately the entire set of letters was destroyed during the blockade of Leningrad in World War II . ) When Orbeli came to the printing offices of the Academy of Sciences , times were hard . The only way to publish the newly translated Problems of Anania was for Orbeli to learn typesetting ( he had always been attracted to the printer 's craft ) . In 1922 Orbeli became the director of printing at the Academy of Sciences . Even after he retired , he remained a tireless champion of Russian academic typography . Back to Earth This book by definition does not exhaust all the most important works in this domain . The editor hopes that those who are guilty of this incompleteness will read these lines and , stung by shame , will work up , if not a collection like this , at least a monograph . -- V.

Gold Let 's imagine a time when space flight is an everyday thing , and high schoolers will spend their breaks as astronauts-in training in the Perelman crater on the far side of the Moon . Maybe one of the space travelers will take this very copy of Quantum , and another , looking over her shoulder , will read this article and say to himself : `` This Anania from Shirak seems like a pretty interesting guy . When I get home I 'll try to find his problems . '' Good luck , my young friend ! Anania is sure to entertain you . Perhaps by then there will be more than n copies of his timeless Problems and Solutions . And we can hope they will be as lovingly printed as the masterpieces created by Iosef Orbeli .

Gamma Ray Bursts ( GRBs ) are seen coming equally from all directions . However , given the number of bright ones , there are too few faint ones to be consistent with being equally dense for as far as we can see -- it is as if they are all contained within a finite sphere ( or a sphere with fuzzy edges ) with us at the center . ( These measurements are statistical , and you can always hide a sufficiently small number of a different type of GRB with a different origin in the data . I am assuming that there is only one population of GRBs ) . The data indicates that we are less than 10 % of the radius of the center of the distribution . The only things the Earth is at the exact center of are the Solar system ( at the scale of the Oort cloud of comets way beyond Pluto ) and the Universe . Cosmological theories , placing GRBs throughout the Universe , require supernova-type energies to be released over a timescale of milliseconds . Oort cloud models tend to be silly , even by the standards of astrophysics . If GRBs were Galactic ( i.e . distributed through the Milky Way Galaxy ) you would expect them to be either concentrated in the plane of the Galaxy ( for a 'disk ' population ) , or towards the Galactic center ( for a spherical 'halo ' population ) . We do n't see this , so if they are Galactic , they must be in a halo at least 250,000 light years in radius , and we would probably start to see GRBs from the Andromeda Galaxy ( assuming that it has a similar halo . ) For comparison , the Earth is 25,000 light-years from the center of the Galaxy . > my own pet theory is that it 's Flying saucers entering > hyperspace : - ) The are n't concentrated in the known spacelanes , and we don't see many coming from Zeta Reticuli and Tau Ceti . > but the reason i am asking is that most everyone assumes that they > are colliding nuetron stars or spinning black holes , i just wondered > if any mechanism could exist and place them closer in . There are more than 130 GRB different models in the refereed literature .

Slight semantical difference . The LDS Church does own a heck of a lot however . They are the largest land holder in MIssouri ( where they think Christ will appear at the second coming ) . I believe they also own some large beverage company like Pepsi ( that was why they had to take caffiene off of their `` forbidden substance '' list ) .

So who cares which PLAYER gets credited , as long as the TEAM > gets more runs ? If a player helps the TEAM get more R and RBI , but > does n't score them all himself , who cares ? Amusing , is n't it ? Seems only the SDCNs realize how much baseball is a *team* game , combining efforts from every player for the win . Consider the Red Sox game last night . The Sox won 4-3 in the bottom of the 13th . Who won the game ? -Clemens pitched a strong nine ( ? ) innings , allowing only two runs . -Ryan pitched a couple shutout innings , though he needed some excellent defensive plays behind him to do so . -Quantrill pitched a couple of innings , gave up the go-ahead run , and got credited with the win when the Sox scored two in the bottom of the inning . Looks like a team effort to me ! Yet only Quantrill got credit for the win . How about the offense ? -Dawson and Vaughn hit ( I think ) HRs early in the game . Without either one , the Sox would have lost in nine . -Quintana led off the 13th with a solid single . -Zupcic pinch-ran for Quintana , providing the speed to go from first to third when ... -Cooper ripped a *second* single in the inning . -Melvin avoided the DP , getting the run home with a sac fly . Not much of a help , but it was something . -Scrub Richardson then hit a double , scoring the speedy Cooper all the way from first ! ( Hill 's lack of defense helped . ) Cooper and Zupcic were credited with runs , Melvin and Richardson were credited with RBIs . But it seems to me that it was Quintana 's hit that set up the whole inning ! And did Melvin really contribute as much as Richardson ? Furthermore , people seem to consider RBIs to be more significant than runs . Did Melvin contribute more than Cooper ? Cooper provided the game-winning baserunner , and moved the tying run to third base with only one out ! Assigning credit based on Runs and RBIs is clearly ridiculous . You can argue that OBP and SLG do n't show you who came through in the clutch , but R & RBI do n't do any better . At least OBP and SLG don't *claim* to try to tell you that . Here 's to the Red Sox who contributed to last night 's victory . All 20 of them ! -Valentine

There would be no problems as long as the OS did n't set up a DMA transfer to an area above the 16 mb area ( the DMA controller probably ca n't be programmed that way anyways , so there probably isi n't a problem with this ) Besides , like I said before , the FDD controller uses DMA channel # 2 .

Do n't know on the last one . And why they are considering using WinBench as a test , they may want to read everything Steve Gibson has said on the subject in his InfoWorld column the past couple of month . In short , virtually every board manufacturer cheats on the test by writing things in the driver that is there only to make the board appear faster on the WinBench suite . So the WinBench score has no bearing in reality to how cards stack up on real world tasks . In the last PC-Magazine they benchmarked some of the new accelerators , and admitted that many of them 'cheated ' on WinBench . Interestingly , they 'allowed ' one type of cheating behaviour ( caching for bitblt operations , no matter how unreal ) , yet did not allow a couple of other types of cheating behaviour that some of the cards used . At least one card was eliminated from the `` Editor 's Choice '' because of cheating on the benchmark . > Al DeVilbiss > al @ col.hp.com

Fundamental human rights , such as the right to life , to education , to establish a family and have children , to human dignity , the right to free movement , to free expression , etc . are more important to human existence that the rights of states . 2 . In the event of a conflict between basic human rights and rights of collectivities , basic human rights should prevail . 3 . Between the collectivities defining themselves as Jewish-Israeli and Palestinian-Arab , however labelled , an unresolved conflict exists . 4 . This conflict has caused great sufferings for millions of people . It moreover poisons relations between communities , peoples and nations . 5 . Each year , the United States expends billions of dollars in economic and military aid to the conflicting parties . 6 . Attempts to solve the Israeli-Arab conflict by traditional political means have failed . 7 . As long as the conflict is perceived as that between two distinct ethnical/religious communities/peoples which claim the land , there is no just nor peaceful solution possible . 8 . Love between human beings can be capitalized for the sake of peace and justice . When people love , they share . Having stated my assumptions , I will now state my proposal . 1 . A Fund should be established which would disburse grants for each child born to a couple where one partner is Israeli-Jew and the other Palestinian-Arab . 2 . To be entitled for a grant , a couple will have to prove that one of the partners possesses or is entitled to Israeli citizenship under the Law of Return and the other partner , although born in areas under current Isreali control , is not entitled to such citizenship under the Law of Return . 3 . For the first child , the grant will amount to $ 18.000 . For the second the third child , $ 12.000 for each child . For each subsequent child , the grant will amount to $ 6.000 for each child . 4 . The Fund would be financed by a variety of sources which have shown interest in promoting a peaceful solution to the Israeli-Arab conflict , including the U.S. Government , Jewish and Christian organizations in the U.S. and a great number of governments and international organizations . 5 . The emergence of a considerable number of 'mixed' marriages in Israel/Palestine , all of whom would have relatives on 'both sides ' of the divide , would make the conflict lose its ethnical and unsoluble core and strengthen the emergence of a truly civil society . The existence of a strong 'mixed ' stock of people would also help the integration of Israeli society into the Middle-East in a graceful manner . Objections to this proposal will certainly be voiced . I will attempt to identify some of these : 1 . The idea of providing financial incentives to selected forms of partnership and marriage , is not conventional . However , it is based on the concept of affirmative action , which is recognized as a legitimate form of public policy to reverse the perverse effects of segregation and discrimination . International law clearly permits affirmative action when it is aimed at reducing racial discrimination and segregation . 2 . It may be objected that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is not primarily a religious or ethnical conflict , but that it is a conflict between a colonialist settler society and an indigenous colonized society that can only regain its freedom by armed struggle . This objection is based on the assumption that the 'enemy ' is not Zionism as ideology and practice , but Israeli-Jewish society and its members which will have to be defeated . This objection has no merit because it does not fulfill the first two assumptions concerning the primacy of fundamental human rights over collective rights ( see above ) 3 . Fundamentalist Jews would certainly object to the use of financial incentives to encourage 'mixed marriages ' . From their point of view , the continued existence of a specific Jewish People overrides any other consideration , be it human love , peace of human rights . The President of the World Jewish Congress , Edgar Bronfman , reflected this view a few years ago in an interview he gave to Der Spiegel , a German magazine . He called the increasing assimilation of Jews in the world a < calamity > , comparable in its effects only with the Holocaust . This objection has no merit either because it does not fulfill the first two assumptions ( see above ) 4 . It may objected that only a few people in Israel/Palestine , would request such grants and that it would thus not serve its purpose . To this objection one might respond that although it is not possible to determine with certainty the effect of such a proposal , the existence of such a Fund would help mixed couples to resist the pressure of their respective societies and encourage young couples to reject fundamentalist and racist attitudes . 5 . It may objected that such a Fund would need great sums to bring about substantial demographic changes . This objection has merits . However , it must be remembered that huge sums , more than $ 3 billion , are expended each year by the United States government and by U.S. organizations to maintain an elusive peace in the Middle-East through armaments . A mere fraction of these sums would suffice to launch the above proposal and create a more favorable climate towards the existence of 'mixed ' marriages in Israel/Palestine , thus encouraging the emergence of a non-segregated society in that worn-torn land . I would be thankful for critical comments to the above proposal as well for any dissemination of this proposal for meaningful discussion and enrichment .

From : kempmp @ phoenix.oulu.fi ( Petri Pihko ) Subject : Re : Atheist 's views on Christianity ( was : Re : `` Accepting Jeesus in your heart ... '' ) Organization : University of Oulu , Finland Lines : 135 Jason Smith ( jasons @ atlastele.com ) wrote : : [ The discussion begins : why does the universe exist at all ? ] : One of the Laws of Nature , specifying cause and effect seems to dictate : ( at least to this layman 's mind ) there must be a causal event . No : reasonable alternative exists . I would argue that causality is actually a property of spacetime ; causes precede their effects . But if you claim that there must be an answer to `` how '' did the universe ( our spacetime ) emerge from '' nothing '' , science has some good candidates for an answer . I have always wondered why Christians use the `` There are questions science ( or atheism ) can not answer '' argument ; I hope this is the appropriate group to ask this question . The most popular question is the question of origins . Why does the universe exist , or anything , for that matter ? I think this question should actually be split into two parts , namely 1 ) Why is there existence ? Why anything exists ? and 2 ) How did the universe emerge from nothing ? It is clear science has nothing to say about the first question . However , is it a meaningful question , after all ? I would say it is n't . Consider the following : A die-hard skeptic being ( be it human or whatever ) attempts to doubt one 's very existence . Since it is so easy to doubt everything else - I can not be _sure_ the world exists , it may be my mind fooling me - can I ever be sure I exist ? However , it is only possible to exist or not to exist . ( Someone insert an appropriate Shakespeare quote here ; - ) ) A being that does not exist can not doubt one 's existence . A being that does exist can doubt one 's existence , but this would be pointless - the being would exist anyway . Let us return to the original question : why ? A being that does not exist does not need any reasons for its non-existence . This being is not _sure_ whether anything else exists but his mind , but let us assume that the world exists independent of the mind ( the objectivity postulate ) . The question `` why anything exists '' can be countered by demanding answer to a question `` why there is nothing in nothingness , or in non-existence '' . Actually , both questions turn out to be devoid of meaning . Things that exist do , and things that do n't exist do n't exist . Tautology at its best . I seriously doubt God could have an answer to this question . Some Christians I have talked to have said that actually , God is Himself the existence . However , I see several problems with this answer . First , it inevitably leads to the conclusion that God is actually _all_ existence , good and evil , devils and angels , us and them . This is pantheism , not Christianity . Another answer is that God is the _source_ of all existence . This sounds much better , but I am tempted to ask : Does God Himself exist , then ? If God is the source of His own existence , it can only mean that He has , in terms of human time , always existed . But this is not the same as the source of all existence . This argument sounds like God does not exist , but meta-exists , and from His meta-existent perspective , He created existence . I think this is actually a nonsolution , a mere twist of words . The best answer I have heard is that human reasoning is incapable of understanding such questions . Being an atheist myself , I do not accept such answers , since I do not have any other methods . The second question : How did the universe emerge from nothing ? belongs to the domain of science , and I , for one , do not doubt the question can be answered by its methods . Many cosmologists have suggested that it is entirely possible for universes to emerge from vacuum ( this possibility has been suggested in a recent Hawking biography ; see also Lizhi & Shuxian : Creation of the Universe , World Scientific , 1989 ) . However , I think the sci groups are more appropriate for discussions like this . : As far as I can tell , the very laws of nature demand a `` why '' . That isn't : true of something outside of nature ( i.e. , *super*natural ) . This is not true . Science is a collection of models telling us `` how '' , not why , something happens . I can not see any good reason why the `` why '' questions would be bound only to natural things , assuming that the supernatural domain exists . If supernatural beings exist , it is as appropriate to ask why they do so as it is to ask why we exist . : I believe the `` genetic code '' will be entirely deciphered in our lifetimes , : but we will not see man convert entirely inert material into self sustaining , : reproducing life , *ever* . ( I 've never been much of a prophet , though . I : ca n't even *picture* New York in my mind 8^ ] ) . I do n't believe *any* : technology would be able to produce that necessary *spark* of life , despite : having all of the parts available . Just my opinion . This opinion is also called vitalism ; namely , that living systems are somehow _fundamentally_ different from inanimate systems . Do Christians in general adopt this position ? What would happen when scientists announce they have created primitive life ( say , small bacteria ) in a lab ? There is a problem with your prophecy : artificial life has been created , although not yet in a chemical form . Computer simulations of evolution contain systems that are as much alive as any bacterium , although their code is electronic , as well as their metabolism . See a recent book Steven Levy : Artificial life - The Quest for a New Creation . Jonathan Cape , London 1992 . Artificial chemical life is just around the corner - after all , no spark of life has been found to be necessary ; living systems do not violate any physical laws as we know them . : You do n't mind if a few of us send up a prayer on your behalf during your : research , do you ? After all , if we of Christ are deluding ourselves , you : really have nothing to worry about , eh ? Exactly . This is why I think atheists should _not_ post any evangelical atheist arguments to soc.religion groups , since people who seek to find peace in religions must be allowed to gather together . I would normally have asked these questions in alt.atheism or talk.religion.misc , but it seems many Christians do not read these groups .

Status : R Redwood City , CA ( API ) -- A tense stand-off entered its third week today as authorities reported no progress in negotiations with charismatic cult leader Steve Jobs . Negotiators are uncertain of the situation inside the compound , but some reports suggest that half of the hundreds of followers inside have been terminated . Others claim to be staying of their own free will , but Jobs ' persuasive manner makes this hard to confirm . In conversations with authorities , Jobs has given conflicting information on how heavily prepared the group is for war with the industry . At times , he has claimed to `` have hardware which will blow anything else away '' , while more recently he claims they have stopped manufacturing their own . Agents from the ATF ( Apple-Taligent Forces ) believe that the group is equipped with serious hardware , including 486-caliber pieces and possibly Canon equipment . The siege has attracted a variety of spectators , from the curious to other cultists . Some have offered to intercede in negotiations , including a young man who will identify himself only as `` Bill '' and claims to be the `` MS-iah '' . Former members of the cult , some only recently deprogrammed , speak hesitantly of their former lives , including being forced to work 20-hour days , and subsisting on Jolt and Twinkies . There were frequent lectures in which they were indoctrinated into a theory of '' interpersonal computing '' which rejects traditional roles . Late-night vigils on Chesapeake Drive are taking their toll on federal marshals . Loud rock and roll , mostly Talking Heads , blares throughout the night . Some fear that Jobs will fulfill his own apocalyptic prophecies , a worry reinforced when the loudspeakers carry Jobs ' own speeches -- typically beginning with a chilling `` I want to welcome you to the 'Next World ' `` . - - -- Roland J.

However , although baseball has adjusted to the presence of black players , many Hispanic players still labor under the stereotype of being `` fireballs , hot blooded , flashy '' . The report also emphasised that despite the rantings ( my word ) of Jessie Jackson about baseballs discrimination against black players in its upper echelons , baseball has actually done much better by black players than Hispanic players . Another interesting point was the language barrier problem . The reporter elaborated on an interview with Ruben Sierra which he gave in Spanish to a Spanish speaking newspaper reporter with the fact that there are maybe 2 major baseball writers that speak Spanish , despite the fact that Spanish is one of ( if not the ) easiest languages to learn , so easy that the author Cormac McCarthy learned Spanish at age 50 in order to research his book , _All The Pretty Horses_ . Yet , few MLB organizations employ Spanish speaking personel , one of the exceptions being the Oakland A 's . Another point : Nearly 90 % of Latin American players have some African blood . Yet , most report that they 'd never really felt black until playing ball in the US . Ironically enough , it is the early presence of Latin American baseball players in the Major Leagues that support the idea that baseball was integrated before the arrival of Jackie Robinson , as many `` light black '' or `` brown '' , Latin Americans were incorporated into baseball . /S -- '' I did not know the cure for the disease -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - of images , but I believed in the healing | Sandra Vigil | power of words and stories .

Way back in today 's newspaper ( Page A7 of San Francisco Chronicle ) there is an article about the document that held the proof . [ used without permission ] '' The document , which was discovered in the archives of the Soviet Communist Party in Moscow , is a Russian translation of what is described as a September 1972 report prepared for the Vietnam Politburo by General Tran Van Quang , who is identified as the deputy chief of staff of the North Vietnamese army . '' [ later on in the article after it talks about the claim of 1,205 Americans in North Vietnamese prisons ] '' Phong said the easiest way to prove that the document is a fabrication is to review Quang 's career . In 1972 , he said , Quang was not deputy chief of staff ; he was the army commander in Military Region 4 in central Vietnam . '' 2 ) I heard on the radio that the Church of Scientology has filed for bankrupcy becuase the employees of Cocolat , owned by CoS , filed a class action suit against them for requiring the employees to pay dues to become members of the Church . Anyone heard more about this ? 3 ) Micheal Jackson went into business with Micheal Milken .

A `` fuel injector cleaning '' at the dealer is probably little more than them opening your gas tank , dumping in a bottle of fuel injector cleaner , and sending you on your merry way $ 59 poorer . Go to KMart and buy the cleaner yourself for $ 1.29 . Just because you dealer sez you need it , do n't mean it 's necessarily so . Be suspicious . jim grey jwg @ acd4.acd.com
From : JEK @ cu.nih.gov Subject : hearing sinners Lines : 18 On the question , `` Does God hear the prayers of sinners ? '' we need to distinguish . If we say that He never hears the prayers of any who have sinned , we make pointless all prayers by anyone born less than 19 centuries ago . But if we consider the prayers of the impenitent sinner , of someone who says , `` Lord , I want you to do this for me , but do n't expect me to change my way of life , '' that is a different matter . Even here , I would not venture to say that God never grants such petitions ( just as He sends sun and rain on the evil and on the good ) . However , if someone we know well is praying to God in that spirit , we might have the responsibility to say , `` Remember , if God 's help is real , then so are His commands . '' Yours , James Kiefer

Mountain View , CA Lines : 90 In < 1qjrec $ qem @ network.ucsd.edu > spl @ ivem.ucsd.edu ( Steve Lamont ) writes : | What I *am* annoyed about is the fact that we were led to believe that | we *would* be able to upgrade to a multiprocessor version of the | Crimson without the assistance of a fork lift truck . It should have been made fairly clear that the *most* Crimson would ever get was a 150 ( 75 old style ) MHz CPU upgrade . Certainly this was mentioned on comp.sys.sgi on more than one occasion as being likely . If our sales folks were saying otherwise , they were either confused , or less than honest/ethical , or somebody further up the chain inside SGI was misleading them . | I 'm also annoyed about being sold *several* Personal IRISes at a | previous site on the understanding *that* architecture would be around | for a while , rather than being flushed . There were 4 versions ( 20 , 25 , 30 , 35 ) , although admittedly the 30 came out at the same time as the 35 , over a period of 2 1/2 years . The chassis simply could n't be pushed any further . I 'd say 4 years was a pretty good lifespan , myself , for a system design in this day and age . Getting the 35 to work caused a lot of gray hairs in both the hardware and product design groups ; we would have been out of our minds to push it further , and I *know* that was made clear , almost from the day the 35 started shipping . We had one last kicker in the form of the Elan graphics , which made 3 graphics versions over its lifespan , which I also think is pretty good . | Now I understand that SGI is responsible to its investors and has to | keep showing a positive quarterly bottom line ( odd that I found myself | pressured on at least two occasions to get the business on the books | just before the end of the quarter ) , but I 'm just a little tired of | getting boned in the process . Please , by all means send a complaint letter through SGI support or sales on your concerns . There should be no reason for sales folks to misrepresent future upgrades to customers ( sure , sometimes there will be confusion for a while , over whether an upgrade will be available , but that should n't last too long , and does n't seem to be what you are referring to ) . Yes , the sales folks *do* get bonus 's at the end of some ( all ? ) quarters , but that is pretty common industry wide , and sometimes that can result in good deals for customers ( sometimes it probably pushes folks into systems that are n't what they need , I 'm sure , but nobody is *forcing* you to buy at end of quarter , after all ... ) | Maybe it 's because my lab buys SGIs in onesies and twosies , so we | are n't entitled to a `` peek under the covers '' as the Big Kids ( NASA , | for instance ) are . This lab , and I suspect that a lot of other labs They do n't get all that long a lead time either ; although certainly they get presentations on possible new products , and their opinions may well influence the end product , but that also is life in the industry . We ca n't design systems that meet just their needs , or we wo n't sell too many systems , after all ( which is not to say that we do n't have some niche products , like Reality Engine ) . | and organizations , does n't have a load of money to spend on computers | every year , so we ca n't be out buying new systems on a regular basis . | The boxes that we buy now will have to last us pretty much through the | entire grant period of five years and , in some case , beyond . That | means that I need to buy the best piece of equipment that I can when I | have the money , not some product that was built , to paraphrase one | previous poster 's words , 'to fill a niche ' to compete with some other | vendor . I 'm going to be looking at this box for the next five years . | And every time I look at it , I 'm going to think about SGI and how I | could have better spent my money ( actually *your* money , since we're | supported almost entirely by Federal tax dollars ) . But surely you do n't expect a system you buy now for a five year period to be constantly upgradable over that entire five year period ?

Tommy Frandsen 's VGAlib ( which is probably what you 're talking about ) will do the standard VGA modes , some tweaked modes and then the Tseng ET4000 Super VGA modes . I have an ET4000 and I 'm viewing GIF 's at 640x480/256 ( I have a lousy/small monitor ) with dpg-view on Linux . I think I had to change some constants in the dpg-view sources to make it use the ET4k modes . VGAlib 's sources seem to be designed for easy addition of new Super VGA support ; each mode is an array of register values and there 's a program that dumps an array declaration of this kind describing the current mode . Have n't tried it though ... ( Btw , my version of VGAlib is 1.2 . ) -- kennu @ mits.mdata.fi Try Linux , a free UNIX by Linus Torvalds for 386+ 's .

Since anyone could do this , any law > that forces a user to provide keys on demand is worthless . The law is much worse than worthless . It gives police the power to put innocent people in jail because they ( the police ) find something they don't understand . Most police do n't know what the return key does , never mind the difference between a core file and classified military secrets . There are plenty of scenarios where the user would have no idea what something is either . It could be uninitialized junk . The burden of proof is on the user to show that it 's something a normal upstanding citizen should have . No one should ever be put in that situation , especially in America . What 's disgusting about this is how easily most people go along with it , to provide a bargaining chip against some hypothetical *alleged* child molester or drug dealer , or whatever bad thing is in style at the time . Basically most people do n't have a clear distinction between criminals and suspects . As an analogy , it 's like they find a loose screw in your house , and they insist that you 're building a bomb or machine gun . They ask you where it came from ( like you 'd know ) , and ask you to prove your claim . When you explain it in such simple terms , people may start to get the idea . As a matter of fact , i do keep random files on my disk . The reason is , without special-purpose hardware , it takes a long time to generate good random bits . I have programs that crank out a couple bits per minute , which is pretty conservative , but over time that 's more than i need . If you think about it , there 's no point in actually encrypting random data , because it just gives you different random data . If you want some data to look like an encrypted file , you just put an appropriate header on it . If enough people do this , some of them will be put in jail . When you get arrested and the police ask for your keys , you can tell them it's just random junk , although of course they wo n't believe you . While you're sitting in jail , you can take consolation in the fact that the government will burn a few CPU-years trying to find something that 's not there . -- Joe Keane , amateur cryptologist jgk @ osc.com ( uunet ! amdcad ! osc ! jgk )

Organization : fnal Lines : 25 Distribution : world NNTP-Posting-Host : phurh.fnal.gov Here 's a question that may be simple enough to answer , but has stumped myself and a few others : What does an external RAM cache card do for you if you already have a large cache set ( through control panel ) in your SIMMs ? EX : I have a Mac IIci with 20 meg RAM , an external video card ( so I don't rob my SIMM 's ) , and the default Apple cache card ( I believe this is 32K ? ) . Say I have my cache set at 2 MEG , what good does a measly 32K do me on the cache card ? Could it actually slow things down by dividing the cache between the card and the SIMM 's ? Or does it still speed things up by providing a 'secondary staging ' area for data normally passed directly into the SIMM RAM cache ? I 'm confused because it seems like cache cards are so low in memory to really do any good compared to what you can set yourself . Yet , Daystar FastCache has numbers which show around a 30 % performance boost on some operations . Are the chips on the cache card simply faster than most SIMM accesses ? Please help , I 'm trying to find the optimum memory settings for the IIci system described in the EX above . -- patrick hurh @ fnal.fnal.gov

Background of the problem : I have a rectangular mesh in the uv domain , i.e the mesh is a mapping of a 3d Bezier patch into 2d . The area in this domain which is inside a trimming loop had to be rendered . The trimming loop is a set of 2d Bezier curve segments . For the sake of notation : the mesh is made up of cells . My problem is this : The trimming area has to be split up into individual smaller cells bounded by the trimming curve segments . If a cell is wholly inside the area ... then it is output as a whole , else it is trivially rejected . Does any body know how thiss can be done , or is there any algo . somewhere for doing this . Any help would be appreciated . Thanks , Ani . -- To get irritated is human , to stay cool , divine .

That people with Israeli stamps on their passports ca n't enter arabic countries ? 2 . Is it true that arabic countries such as Jordan and Syria have undefined borders and that arab governments from 1948 until today have refused to state where the ultimate borders of their states should be ? 3 . Is it true that arab countires refused to sign the Chemical weapon convention treaty in Paris in 1993 ? 4 . Is it true that in arab prisons there are a number of individuals which were tried in secret and for which their identities , the date of their trial and their imprisonment are state secrets ? 4a . Is it true that some arab countries , like Syria , harbor Nazi war criminals , and refuse to extradite them ? 4b . Is it true that some arab countries , like Saudi Arabia , prohibit women from driving cars ? 5 . Is it true that Jews who reside in the Muslim countries are subject to different laws than Muslims ? 6 . Is it true that arab countries confiscated the property of entire Jewish communites forced to flee by anti-Jewish riots ? 7 . Is it true that Israel 's Prime Minister , Y. Rabin , signed a chemical weapons treaty that no arab nation was willing to sign ? 8 . Is it true that Syrian Jews are required to leave a $ 10,000 deposit before leaving the country , and are no longer allowed to emmigrate , despite promises made by Hafez Assad to George Bush ? 9 . Is it true that Jews in Muslim lands are required to pay a special tax , for being Jews ? 10 . Is it true that Intercontinental Hotel in Jerusalem was built on a Jewish cemetary , with roads being paved over grave sites , and gravestones being used in Jordanian latrines ? 11 . Is it really cheesy and inappropriate to post lists of biased leading questions ? 11a . Is it less appropriate if information implied in Mr. Davidsson 's questions is highly misleading ?

The HiColor card is advertised as a faster-than-standard video card , but it does not have an accelerator chip on it . I am running at 800x600x32k .

This is a very good dirt bike and has been maintained perfectly . I never had any problems with it . It 's a four stroke , 4 valves , liquid cooled engine . It is heavier than a 250 2 stroke but still lighter than a Honda XR600 and has a lot better suspension ( Ohlins shock , Husky fork ) than the XR . For the casual or non competitive rider , the engine is much better than any two stroke . You can easily lug up hills and blast through trails with minimum gear changes . The 1992 ignition and the carefully tuned carburation makes this bike very easy to start ( starts of first kick when cold or hot ) . There is a custom made carbon/kevlar ( light 1 pound ) wrap around skid plate to protect the engine cases and the water pump . The steering angle has been reduced by 2 degree to increase steering quickness . This with the suspension tune-up by Phil Douglas of Aftershock ( Multiple time ISDE rider ) gives it a better ride than most bike : plush suspension , responsive steering with no head shake . So if it is such a good bike why sell it ? ? ? ? Gee , I want to buy a Husaberg , which just a husky but 25 pounds lighter ... and a tad more $ $ $ .

( 1 ) No explicit ( c ) is necessary . If it the image is attributed to the Geosphere Company , then there is a likelihood permission is has been given to reprint . ( 2 ) Unlikely that the owner can or will go after individuals . However , `` interesting '' images do make their way into ads and computer demos . That is when a pirate might get some flak . This image is considered so `` interesting '' that many people would like to use it whenever some global map is needed , so there is lots of temptation . ( 3 ) One mail person said since the source data- satellite imagery- is not copyrighted , then the derived image ca n't be . Not true . A new , distinctive , creative expression of the data can be protected . This image is certainly fits such , since NO ONE ELSE has taken the tremendous effort to re-create it themselves . Precedent is a recent telephone book court case . Ma Bell tried to copyright the data in their books and prevent competitors from copying it ( there are trick entries in the book ) . But the court only permitted copyright of the expression of the data , and not the data themselves . ( You cant xerox and sell the telephone book . ) ( 4 ) There will be more attention to digital copyrights in the future and computer becomes a mass product and moguls such as Bill Gates are currently hoarding the digital copyrights . ( 5 ) I 'd prefer that Geosphere put this data in the public domain because it is very interesting to me and others , but that 's the way things are .

From : REXLEX @ fnal.fnal.gov Subject : Assurance of Hell Organization : FNAL/AD/Net Lines : 139 I dreamed that the great judgment morning had dawned , and the trumpet had blown . I dreamed that the sinners had gathered for judgment before the white throne . Oh what weeping and wailing as the lost were told of their fate . They cried for the rock and the mountains . They prayed , but their prayers were too late . The soul that had put off salvation , '' Not tonight I 'll get saved by and by . No time now to think of ... ... . religion , '' Alas , he had found time to die . And I saw a Great White Throne . Now , some have protest by saying that the fear of hell is not good for motivation , yet Jesus thought it was . Paul thought it was . Paul said , '' Knowing therefore , the terror of the Lord , we persuade men . '' Today , too much of our evangelism is nothing but soft soap and some of it is nothing but evangelical salesmanship . We do n't tell people anymore , that there 's such a thing as sin or that there 's such a place as hell . As Jayne has said , this does n't mean we have to come on so strong so as to hit people over the head with a baseball bat . Yet the fact remains , there is a place called hell . A place so fearful that God died to save us from having to experience it . Whatever you or I , as Christians , do , we should do whatever we can to win people to the Lord , if for no other reason , to keep them from going to `` outer darkness. '' . Jesus , in Mt . 25 , tells us that He did n't prepare hell for people . He prepared it for the Devil and his angels . No where in the Bible do I read -anywhere , that God predestined anybody to go to hell . D.L . Moody use to say that the elect are the `` whosoever will '' and the nonelect are the `` whosoever wont 's . '' Whether or not that 's theologically sound , I could n't defend , but its practical . Jesus said to the people of Israel , `` Ye would not . '' Now , some of you may not be students of the Bible , heck -some of you may not be Christians . Have you ever said to somebody , `` I do n't believe in hell . I believe in the religion of Jesus . '' But did you know that Jesus talked more about hell than He did about heaven ! `` Oh I believe in the religion of the sermon on the mount . '' You find hell taught by Jesus in the sermon on the mount . You 'll read that Jesus talked about the tree being cast into the fire . Several times he talks about hell and about judgment . In fact , over and over in the synoptics , Matthew , Mark and Luke , Jesus talks about hell . Not Isaiah . Not Moses . Not John the Baptist , though he did , but Jesus , the Son of God . The great Beloved One preached about hell because He loved people and didn't want to see them go there . Now , if there is no hell then Jesus preached in vain . It was our Lord Jesus , not some angry Baptist preacher , that said , `` where the worm never dies , and where the fire never goes out . '' Jesus said that . It was Jesus who called hell a `` furnace of fire . '' It was Jesus that used the word , `` condemnation . '' `` And this is the condemnation , that men love darkness rather than light because their deeds are evil . Jesus said that . How can we get it across to you that a loving , dying Jesus preached about hell ? Not only that , but He went through hell . That 's what Calgary was all about . When my Lord was on the cross , darkness fell . He called hell , `` outer darkness . '' Do you have this idea that hell is a place where the gamblers are gambling over here , the drunks are getting drunk over there , and the prostitutes are prostituting their bodies over there ? That 's not what hell is . Hell 's not a party . There 's no fellowship there . He called it `` outer darkness . '' `` Outer '' -away from God . `` Darkness '' -God is light . No when He was on the cross , He was made sin for you and for me . God treated Jesus the way sinners have to be treated . That 's is a sobering thought . As my son would say , an `` awesome '' thought . `` My God , My God why hast Thou forsaken me ? '' Hell is isolation . There 's no fellowship in hell . There 's no friendship in hell . There 's no loving embrace in hell . There 's no hand shake in hell . There 's no word of encouragement in hell . `` I thirst . '' It goes much deeper than physical thirst . Hell is eternal craving with no satisfaction . The man whose life was lived for drugs , will crave it eternally . The man whose life was lived for the lust of a woman 's body , will crave it eternally -and not be satisfied . One theologian has put it this way and I think it deserves merit . What is hell ? Hell is just the kind of environment that matches the internal condition of the lost . In a recent post , I was trying to remember the founder of The Word of Life ministries . I 've remembered his name , Jack Wertzen , and found that the illustration that I gave was n't his . His illustration was that he was talking to his barber and his barber 's wife and daughter had just recently been saved and he was commenting about it to Jack . `` They sing these songs and read Bible verses , and their praising this and that -I ca n't stand it ! Jack , do you think God would send me to hell ? '' Jack answered by saying , `` Yes I think he would ! '' Of course the barber said , `` What do you mean by that . '' `` Well if you can't stand living at home with your wife and daughter who sing hymns and praises to God now , what would you do in heaven where they 'll do it for eternity ? You'd be miserable . Because God loves you , He 'd put you where it would match what you really are . '' It makes a man think . The crucifixion of Jesus Christ is a fact that necessitates the eternal existence of hell because on the cross He performed an eternal act . Do n't ask me how , I do n't know . But He is God and He is the infinite/eternal and when He died , He died an infinite/eternal death . It is by that eternal act that He purchased eternal life for the `` whosoever wills . '' He suffered eternal judgment . A lot of people would like to detour around hell by saying `` Everybody is going to be saved eventually . '' -universalism . My Bible says no , He 'll separate them . The sheep from the goats . `` .After you die there 's a probationary period in which God prepares you for heaven . '' No , my Bible says that `` It is appointed unto men once to die and then comes judgment . '' Some of the cultist believe in annihilation . After you die , sssswish . Just like a mosquito you 're squished out . No , in Rev we are told that their is eternal existence in hell just as there is in heaven . I do n't enjoy making these kind of statements and maybe you do n't enjoy listening to them , but we have to preach the entire Word of God . -There is a place called hell . If I could give one verse of Scripture that could give any hope that people are n't going there , I 'd give it to you , but I have n't found it . That fact that there is a place called hell , the fact that our God is a God of holiness and must judge sin , the fact that He has made us the kind of creatures we are and therefore we 're responsible , the fact that He has placed us in a `` uni '' verse that has purpose and design behind it , the fact that sin is such an awful thing and the fact that God Himself went through hell to save us from hell leads us to two applications . 1 ) As I 've already mentioned . If you are a Christian , you must worn others . Its not good enough to stop and fix their flat tire and not tell them that just around the bend the bridge is out . `` Knowing therefore the terror of Lord , we persuade men . '' 2 ) If you have n't accepted Jesus are your Savior , you 're taking an awful chance . As I say to the Jehovah Witnesses ( who no longer frequent my door ) , if you are right and I am wrong , then I will have lived a good life and will die and cease to exist , but if I am right and you are wrong , then you will die and suffer eternal damnation . I do n't mean to make fun at this point , but its like Dirty Harry said , `` You 've got to ask yourself , 'Do I feel lucky ? ' Well do you ? '' `` A man 's got to know his limitations . '' Do n't be one of the `` whosoever wont 's . '' `` Because while I was yet a sinner , He died for me . '' `` There 's no greater love than this , that a man lay down his life for another .

What is the state of affairs about this . I went to a doctor and paid $ 85 for a 10 minute interview + 3 scratches , leading to the diagnostic that I am allergic to ( June and Timothy ) grass . I believe this . From now on it looks like 2 shots per week for 6 months followed by 1 shot per month or so . Each shot costs $ 20 . Talking about soaring costs and the Health care system , I would call that a racket . We are not talking about rare Amazonian grasses here , but the garbage which grows behind the doctor 's office . Apart from this issue , I was somewhat disappointed to find out that you have to keep getting the shots forever . Is that right ? Thanks for information . Ej

If the emphasis is on the `` in general '' , then of course you're correct , since you have n't really said anything . If we restrict our observations to practiced religions , there are lots of examples of god mandated genocide . Just ask the Canaanites .

No , I am _not_ neglecting that , I 'm merely asking you whether the existance of Israeli citicens in the WB or in Gaza invalidates those individuals right to live , a ( as you so eloquently put it ) human right .

What do you expect me to tell you , Master of Wisdom , when I did explain my point in the post , that you `` responded to '' . The point is that since Israel is occupying then it is automatically depriving itself from some of its rights to the Occupied Palestineans , which is exactly similar the automatic deprivation of a killer from his right of life to the society .

The question is NOT which system would solve the ME problem . Why ? because any system can solve it . The laws of minister Sharon says kick Palestineans out of here ( all palestine ) .

Now that I have straightened that out , I 'm eagerly awaiting your reply . Joseph Weitz ( administrator responsible for Jewish colonization ) said it best when writing in his diary in 1940 : `` Between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both peoples together in this country ... . We shall not achieve our goal ^^^ ^^^ of being an independent people with the Arabs in this small country . The only solution is a Palestine , at least Western Palestine ( west of the Jordan river ) without Arabs ... . And there is no other way than to transfer the Arabs from here to the neighbouring countries , to transfer all of them ; not one village , not one tribe , should be left ... . Only after this transfer will the country be able to absorb the millions of our own brethren . There is no other way out .

I 'm not going to get into the question if he wrote the above , but it 's fairly obvious all parties in the conflict have their share of fanatics . Guess what.. ? Those are not the people that will make any lasting peace in the region . Ever . It 's those who are willing to make a tabula rasa and start over , and willing to give in order to get something back . `` We '' and `` our '' either refers to Zionists or Jews ( i donot know which ) . Well , i can give you an answer , you Master of Wisdom , I will NOT suggest the imperialist israeli system for solving the ME problem ! I think that is fair enough . No , that is _not_ an answer , since I asked for a system that could solve the problem . You said any could be used , then you provided a contradiction . Guess where that takes your logic ?

The motherboard : - US-made Micronics 8-slot motherboard with Intel 386dx/25mhz CPU - 64kb SRAM cache - 4mb 80us RAM using 4x1mb simms ( worth $ 150 alone ) - Cyrix 83D87 math coprocessor ( worth $ 90 alone ) - Norton SI 6.0 rating of 26.1 - Latest version Phoenix BIOS Please do not post/email saying `` but I can get a Taiwanese SuperClone 386/90 for only $ 9.95 including a free toaster ! '' . I am *certain* you can find a cheaper Brand X board without even breaking a sweat . *New* Micronics CPUs command a several-hundred dollar premium because they are US-made , use high-quality components , and are known to be both very reliable and compatible . They have been OEMed in systems sold by both Gateway and Zeos at various points in the past . ( Check out the ads in the back pages of Byte or PC Magazine if you want to see this price differential for yourself . ) Price : $ 495 complete , $ 100 less if you do n't want/need the case and power supply . The board is fully guaranteed . Email for further details or for any questions . Thanks ! -- David Ruggiero ( jdavid @ halcyon.com ) Seattle , WA : Home of the Moss People

The problem is with ISA bus-masters which can only address the first 16MBs of system memory . Bus-masters do not use the CPU nor the system DMA to do the actual data transfer but transfer their data directly to the system RAM . rp93 -- Roger C.

From : bolson @ carson.u.washington.edu ( Edward Bolson ) Subject : Re : Sphere from 4 points ? Organization : University of Washington , Seattle Lines : 33 Distribution : world NNTP-Posting-Host : carson.u.washington.edu I plan to post a summary of responses to this as soon as I have working code , which I will also include . The intersection of 3 planes method looks best , but my implementation based on a short article in Graphics Gems I does n't work . I may be misinterpreting , of course . I had avoided the simultaneous solution of the plane equations in favor of dot and cross products , but the former may actually be better . In either case a matrix determinant needs to be computed ( implicitly in the solution of linear equations ) . To get the planes , I was taking the midpoint of the line from , say , P1 to P2 , and setting the normal as the `` normalized '' vector from P1 to P2 . These just plugged into the formula in Graphics Gems . HOwever , the resulting center point is only occasionally equidistant from all 4 of my test points ( for different tests ) . My matrix/vector math is very rusty , but it looks like I need to verify the formula , or use the simultaneous equation solution , which will require bringing in another routine I do n't have ( but should be easy to find ) . Another method is to first find the center of the circle defined by 2 sets of 3 points , and intersecting the normals from there . This would also define the circle center . However , small numerical imprecisions would make the lines not intersect . Supposedly 3 planes HAVE to intersect in a unique point if they are not parallel .

I 'd like to ask a few more questions . 1 . What are the advantages of buying a global village Teleport Gold over other cheaper brands like Supra , Zoom etc ? 2 . I heard that both Supra and Zoom use the same software . Why are there so many complaints about the incompatibility problems of Supra ? What kind of incompatibility is it ? 3 . If I decided to buy the Teleport Gold , is there any possibility to add a voice option in the near future ? 4 . Has anyone heard of a possible voice option that Supra will offer this coming summer ? 5 . A person did mention a new AT & T modem . Is it getting good reviews from various Mac Magazines ? 6 . If I want the best , fastest , most economically sound and possible voice option , what fax modem should I buy ? Sorry for posting so many questions , but I think they 're necessary . I promise to repost any answers if they 're not already posted by a responder . Thanks so much in advance . Regards , Thian .

From : aew @ eosvcr.wimsey.bc.ca ( Alan Walford ) Subject : Summary : ATI Graphics Ultra Questions etc Reply-To : aew @ eosvcr.wimsey.bc.ca Organization : Eos Systems Inc , Vancouver , B.C. , Canada Lines : 147 To those interested in the new ATI Ultra Cards : I had posted some questions regarding the new ATI Ultra Pro cards and had asked confirmation of some opinions . This message is a summary of the responses . Thanks to all of you that replied . > 1 ) The card does not work in a system with 32M RAM . a ) The higher memory limits apply to ISA cards only , as far as I know . The VLB and EISA version should have no problems . b ) I 'm pretty sure from my experience that the ISA version doesn't work in systems with over 16M Ram . There is supposed to be way of switching the `` memory aperture '' feature off to prevent this , but apparently it does n't work . I posted some `` help me '' messages on the net and people indicated that the EISA card did n't have this problem . c ) FALSE d ) The VLB card , which I have , allows you to set memory aperture over 32M by using their configuration software . No messing with jumpers necessary . The 32M problem is probably valid only for ISA cards . > 2 ) The card works in a 32M system with some switches > set but it is much slower . a ) Again , the memory aperture need only be disabled if you have more than 124M RAM ( EISA and VLB ) or 12 M ( ISA ) . 32M should not be a problem for you . b ) Dunno . c ) Depends on the bus . YES if ISA , NO if EISA or Localbus > 3 ) The card is _interlaced_ in its 24bit ( true-colour ) modes . a ) Nope . I can use 640x480 at 72hz , 24-bit and 800x600 at 70hz , 24-bit , all non-interlaced . b ) Yes - According to PC Magazine , they 've tested a local bus version that does 1024x768 in 24-bit which may or may not be interlaced . c ) Not for the Pro . Sometimes for the Plus . Some modes may run only interlaced on certain monitors . This has nothing to do with 24 bits ... only with screen size . Note that for 24 bit color and Windows you MUST have 2 megs , memory size calculations notwithstanding . > 4 ) The latest build 59 drivers still do not work in many > cases . a ) They are n't perfect , but are much improved . I do n't recall the last time which I had to leave mach 32 mode ( ATI GUP mode ) and switch to 8514 or VGA mode due to software incompatibility . b ) True . Many people recommended going back to Build 55 or 54. c ) They appear to be excellent , but have a few bugs . For example , certain graphs with dashed lines in Mathcad 3.1 do not print correctly , though they do display OK on the screen . They are about par for fancy cards .. other accelerated cards also have bugs . d ) Overall , I like the card , even if driver performance is somewhat less than satisfactory .

Yes . But this is *irrelevant* . You 're talking about averages , when we have lots of information about THIS PLAYER IN PARTICULAR to base our decisions on .

Why is n't Lopez likely to hit that well ? He hit that well last year ( after adjusting his stats for park and league and such ) ; he hit better ( on an absolute scale ) than Olson or Berryhill did . By a lot . As for rushing ... If there really is a qualitative difference between the minors and the majors that requires a period of adjustment ( and I don't believe there is ) , then would n't you rather waste Lopez 's 22-year old good season than his 23-year old very good season or his 24-year-old excellent season ?

The point was not that 17 AB is a significant sample , but rather that he had n't done anything in spring training to cause even a blockhead manager to question whether his minor league numbers were for real , or to send him down `` until he gets warmed up '' . > OK .

Ummm . Justice is a very fine hitter . Pendleton might have another big year in his bat , but he might also spend the season in Hamstring Hell . Gant is a big question mark . The Bream/Hunter platoon is decent ( not excellent ) and has rotten OBP or SLG ( depending on who 's in ) . Blauser is a very valuable bat ... for a shortstop . > The center > field platoon will probably hit .300 . However good Lopez' > bat *might* be ( given the above ) it wo n't be so much better than > what they have to offset the differential in experience and > defensive ability . Wan na bet ? The difference between Lopez 's bat and Olson/Berryhill could be 20 or 30 runs over the course of the season .

I bought a Viewsonic 17 for use at home but after a week I took it back . I felt for the money my NEC 5FG that I use at work was a much better monitor . The NEC is sharper , flatter , less distorted , and more stable . I have heard complaints from people about the NEC FG series having some quality control problems but mine has been in use for about a year with no problems at all . There was nothing really broken with the Viewsonic but overall it did not match up . I used my ATI Graphics Ultra in setup mode to push the frequencies to their limits and the Viewsonic exhibited some problems that the NEC did not . I personally like the non-etched NEC with the OCLI filter and the tube on the 17 was not as nice . The 17 had some uncorrectable pincusion and edge distortion problems . Also , it would change brightness when I switched modes and I was constantly having to fiddle with the controls . And the yoke was crooked and I had no way to compensate for the raster that tilted downhill . On the postive side , although not as handsome as the NEC , the 17 had a smaller footprint and was not as heavy . I have heard that Panasonic owns Viewsonic and the model 17 is being sold through OEM channels with a Panasonic label on it . If it 's available that way at a lower cost I could get more serious about it . For now the NEC has my vote but I 'm searching for one of the new , cheaper , NEC 5FGe 's to see if it 's just as good as its older brother the 5FG before I decide which one to buy . I have no experience with the Nanao . I can never keep the Nanao models straight and do n't have any place I can walk in to get a good comparison of all models . -- Standard employer disclaimers apply -- Keith W.

The original posting complained ( 1 ) about SGI coming out with newer ( and better ) architectures and not having an upgrade path from the older ones , and ( 2 ) that DEC did . On statement ( 1 ) , I merely attempted to point out that all computer companies are constantly attempting to improve their product ( & market position/share ) . In so doing , they eventually come to a point where they have a new architecture , and the only upgrade path is to replace the system . And the particular system he was complaining about was ( in computer lifetimes ) relatively old . On statement ( 2 ) , I felt DEC 's history of providing upgrades was not far superior than the industry `` average '' , and that , in my opinion , SGI's history is better than DEC 's . ( And what is DEC doing with it 's MIPS based DECstation line ? Are they going to `` abandon '' it for their Alpha based line , or provide an upgrade path to R4400 's and TFP 's and R5 's ? ) --

Sir , if you were a Canadian , and owned a gun before the restrictive gun laws were passed , and decided to hide it rather than turn it in , would you answer truthfully a question about gun ownership from someone who calls , writes , or asks you on the street ? That is one problem with surveys . Nobody will answer an incriminating question .

I have a feeling > this ca n't be fixed in emacs itself , but that I need to do some > xmodmap stuff . Can someone help me ? Unfortunately , the key event handling is pretty much hardwired into emacs . I ran into this problem a while back ; my solution was to change the source code so that all of these special keys generated character sequences which basically encoded the keysym and modifier state as escape sequences -- for example , the sequence `` ESC [ 1 B 7 '' would indicate that the `` HOME '' key was pressed , with the shift key down . You could also detect standard keys with odd modifiers , such as `` shift-Return '' . If anybody wants these changes , they 're welcome to them , but you'll have to have the source available and be comfortable munging with it a bit . Basically you have to replace the keypress handling code in the source file `` x11term.c '' . Maybe if someone at OSF is interested , I can send them the tweaks , but I imagine they 've got bigger fish to fry ( hopefully including the much talked about emacs V19 ! ) . If there 's sufficient interest , I 'll post the mods somewhere , although this probably is n't the appropriate group for it . Notes : * This special code will only apply if you let emacs create its own ( X11 ) window . If you run it in plain old tty mode ( which includes Xterm windows ) then it 's business as usual . * The patches I made were to version 18.58 , under Sun OS 4.1.2 [ I also did this a while back under HP-UX ] . The patches are in a chunk of code between ' # if sun ... # endif ' but could easily be adapted for anything else . + -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -+ -- -- -- - /// -- -- -+ | Mark Lanzo KD4QLZ lanzo @ tekelec.com 919-460-5576 | \\\/// | + -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -+ -- -- \XX/ -- -- -- -+

But do n't you see that the same statement can be made both ways ? If Lebanon was interested in peace then it should accept the word of Israel that the attacks were the cause for war and disarming the Hizbollah will remove the cause for its continued occupancy .

True , but the Syrians did allow ( until at least 1984 ) guerillas to operate in the areas that were under their control , provided that those guerillas were attacking Israeli lines .

Well , it was n't that way for Enoch and Elijah , both of whom were translated directly into heaven . It 's beyond my grasp why some object that Mary , who was far greater than either Enoch or Elijah , should not benefit from the same privelege they recieved .

And in St. Germain of Constantinople and St. John of Damascus , and in St. Andrew of Crete , among others . And it should be noted that the Monophysite Chruches of Egypt and Syria also hold to this belief as part of divine revelation , even though they broke away from the unity of the Chruch in 451 AD by rejecting the Council of Chalcedon . It might be argued by some Protestants that the Catholics and Orthodox made this belief up , but the Monophysites , put a big hole in that notion , as they also hold the belief , and they split from the Chruch before the belief was first annunciated in writing ( as far as is known , much has been lost from the time of the Fathers ) .

If a player is on the ice when his team scores a lot of goals and only allows a few goals , he must be doing something right . It is especially useful to compare between teammates- as they play for the same team and should have roughly similar +/- ratings if they are equally good players . It can be adjusted- with varying degrees of success to compare between players on different teams . I agree it would be nice for the NHL to keep more statistics- but how useful are the ones that you suggest ? ? Total ice time would be very useful- it is a missing stat in Jagr vs Francis arguments from before . Somehow measuring the quality of ice time as you suggest would be useless . It would be a better stat for evaluating coaching- ie are the players given quality ice time actually their talented ones ? A very good player could be given low amounts of quality ice time because of team depth or a stupid coach who does n't recognize his talent and a very bad player could be given lots of quality ice time because of a lack of team depth or a stupid coach that thinks he is an effective player . This stat would be much more flawed than +/- and almost no conclusions could be drawn regarding player talent . +/- is a useful stat . It is quite useful in evaluating player talent . You are the one displaying ignorance because of your unwillingness to see that being on the ice when goals are scored but not when they are allowed is a very positive thing- and should be evaluated as such .

Tough question -- more dangerous than driving a car , and far more dangerous if you do n't apply a modicum of intelligence to the activity . Basically , stupidity will get you hurt/killed a lot faster on a motorcycle than in a car . But with care , it is not unreasonably dangerous . Also , buying good protective clothing is helpful , that way if something does go wrong , you are likely to be less severely injured . First thing , if possible take a ( MSF ) driver training course , this will get you started on the right foot -- they teach control of the vehicle and safe riding practices . Second , buy protective gear . At minimum a good helmet and a pair of leather gloves are a must . A good sturdy piece of footgear is also very helpful , though leather hiking boots , a pair of old army boots , or something similar works fine for this purpose as long as you make sure the laces stay tied . After those , a leather jacket and leather pants or chaps are nice as well ; but these are also expensive items . For the pants , many people consider a good pair of jeans to be reasonable , preferably recent and of a fairly heavy weight . Similarly for a jacket , a good jean jacket is a reasonable compromise , though more people tend to have leather jackets around than pants . Another thing to do is drop in on garage sales looking for a second-hand leather jacket . Look for a fairly thick leather in these items . Third do n't do anything stupid -- do n't ride after drinking , even one drink can noticeably affect you judgement and balance ; do n't ride in the snow , or when conditions are such that black ice is likely ; be very careful riding in the rain -- slow way down , take corners gingerly , brake early and gently ; try not to ride if you are sick , tired , taking any medication with drowsiness warnings , or otherwise not in average shape . With care , you should be ok. > The next question I have is what bike would you recommend for > a first time rider . I do n't want to race ; nor do I want to > ride cross country ; nor do I want to ride on dirt trails . I'll > probably drive it on back roads with occasional rides on city > streets and freeways . The maximum I can spend is about $ 2500 so > I 'll be looking at a used bike . I would suggest mid to late 80 's japanese mid-sized standard . Something in 400-650 cc range would probably be reasonable . If you are shorter/lighter than average , you might want to go as low as a 300-400 cc bike . Possible models : The Suzuki GS # # # series ( eg . GS500 , GS650 , etc. ) . These are generally inline 4 bikes , generally dependable except for a tendency to weakness in the charging system . ( Stator and/or Regulator/Rectifier problems . ) My first bike was a ( about '82 ) GS650 , it server me well . The Honda Nighthawk series ( this may also be known as the CB # # # series I think ) . eg . Honda CB450 , CB650 , etc . This is another series of standard motorcycles . Also fairly dependable . Kawasaki and Yamaha probably have similar bikes , but I do n't know them as well . For mid to late '80s models of the above , you should be able to buy the bike for under $ 2000 , leaving you money for protective clothing and insurance and licensing costs .

From : sera @ zuma.UUCP ( Serdar Argic ) Subject : Muslims were one by one cruelly bayonetted to death by Armenians . Reply-To : sera @ zuma.UUCP ( Serdar Argic ) Distribution : world Lines : 93 In article < 1993Apr15.132954.4396 @ news.columbia.edu > lasner @ watsun.cc.columbia.edu ( Charles Lasner ) writes : > How dare you presume that he even has a right to go around a newsgroup > with a desire to convince others of any external position he has . They are news because they are the exceptions . And the 'Islamic Holocaust' is much the topic of the day . The historical evidence proves that during the period of 1914 to 1920 , the Armenian Government ordered , incited , assisted and participated in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people because of race , religion and national origin . Armenians perpetrated acts of sabotage , destroyed telephone cables , blew up bridges , blocked passes , set up ambushes , attacked security stations and small Turkish outposts behind the Ottoman Army lines on the one hand , and on the other ruthlessly attacked Turkish and Kurdish villages , slaughtering the Turkish population indiscriminately , women , children , old and young alike . Innocent Muslims were one by one cruelly bayonetted to death , or massacred with axes and swords , or else shut up in mosques or in schools and then burnt alive as can be seen below . Widespread Armenian massacres of innocent Muslims took place in regions of Van , Kars , Sivas , Erzurum , Bitlis , Erzincan , Mus , Diyarbakir and Maras . The Ottoman Army , while fighting to prevent the Russian invasion , also had to deal with Armenian genocide squads who cowardly hit from behind . The Armenian genocide of the Muslims spread to all parts of Eastern Anatolia . Starting from late 1914 , Armenians committed widespread massacres and genocide in Eastern Anatolia , because the arena was left to the Armenians . Almost every Turkish town and village from Erzincan up to Azerbaidjan suffered large scale massacres and genocide by Armenians and the Turkish genocide has been documented by Armenian , Russian , American , British , Ottoman , German , Austrian and French journalists and officers who observed the first genocide of this century committed by the blood-thirsty Armenian genocide squads . The Ottoman Army , liberating Trabzon , Bayburt , Erzincan , Erzurum , Kars and other regions from the Russians , saw that the cities and their villages had been destroyed and burnt , people slaughtered , massacred . The massacres conducted by Armenians , which became a black stain for humanity , shocked and disgusted even the Russian , British , German , Austrian , French and American authorities . Almost every Ottoman document is related to Armenian massacres and cruelties . The inhuman treatment , cruelties , atrocities , genocide by Armenian genocide squads perpetrated against innocent Moslem Turkish and Kurdish people , are sufficiently reflected in historical documents . Even today over seventy-five years later , the terrifying screams of the victims of these cruelties can be heard .

Although two months have elapsed since the clearing of the territories of Armenian gangs , I have been observing the evidence of the cruelties of the Armenians at almost every step . All the villages from Trabzon to Erzincan and from Erzincan to Erzurum are destroyed . Corpses of Turks brutally and cruelly slain are everywhere . According to accounts by those who were able to save their lives by escaping to mountains , the first horrible and fearful events begun when the Russian forces evacuated the places which were then taken over by Armenian gangs . The Russians usually treated the people well , but the people feared the intervention of the Armenians . Once these places had been taken over by the Armenians , however , the massacres begun . They clearly announced their intention of clearing what they called the Armenian and Kurdish land from the Turks and thus , solve the nationality problem . Today I had the opportunity to meet Austrian and German soldiers who had escaped from Russian prison camps and come from Kars and Alexander Paul ( Gumru-Leninakan ) ... Russian officers tried to save the Turks and there were clashes between Russian officers and Armenian gangs . I am now in Erzurum , and what I see is terrible . Almost the whole city is destroyed . The smell of the corpses still fills the air . Although there are speculations that Armenian gangs murdered Austrian and German prisoners as well , I could not get the supporting evidence in this regard , but there is proof of murdering of Turkish prisoners of war . '' Dr. Stephan Eshnanie Serdar Argic 'We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the Turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination .

How much does it cost ? > Personally , Cylink stuff is out of my budget for personal use : ) ... If the Clipper chip can do cheap crypto for the masses , obviously one could do the same thing WITHOUT building in back doors . Indeed , even without special engineering , you can construct a good system right now . A standard codec chip , a chip to do vocoding , a DES chip , a V32bis integrated modem module , and a small processor to do glue work , are all you need to have a secure phone . You can dump one or more of the above if you have a fast processor . With integration , you could put all of them onto a single chip -- and in the future they can be . Yes , cheap crypto is good -- but we do n't need it from the government . You can do everything the clipper chip can do without needing it to be compromised . When the White House releases stuff saying `` this is good because it gives people privacy '' , note that we did n't need them to give us privacy , the capability is available using commercial hardware right now . Indeed , were it not for the government doing everything possible to stop them , Qualcomm would have designed strong encryption right in to the CDMA cellular phone system they are pioneering . Were it not for the NSA and company , cheap encryption systems would be everywhere . As it is , they try every trick in the book to stop it . Had it not been for them , I 'm sure cheap secure phones would be out right now . They are n't the ones making cheap crypto available . They are the ones keeping cheap crypto out of people 's hands . When they hand you a clipper chip , what you are getting is a mess of pottage -- your prize for having traded in your birthright . And what did we buy with our birthright ? Did we get safety from foreigners ? No . They can read conference papers as well as anyone else and are using strong cryptography . Did we get safety from professional terrorists ? I suspect that they can get cryptosystems themselves on the open market that work just fine -- most of them ca n't be idiots like the guys that bombed the trade center . Are we getting cheaper crypto for ourselves ? No , because the market would have provided that on its own had they not deliberately sabotaged it . Someone please tell me what exactly we get in our social contract in exchange for giving up our right to strong cryptography ? -- Perry Metzger pmetzger @ shearson.com -- Laissez faire , laissez passer .

First , the uranium fuel is sealed in zirconium alloy cylinders ( which do n't melt in any circumstances short of major failure of the power plant ) . Second , the primary water ( that circulates inside the reactor core ) is never pumped into the cooling tower ( it 's the SECONDARY water cycle that goes through the cooling tower ) . Third , liquid uranium would burst into flame on contact with air . > Contact with the cool outside air > will condense the mist and it will fall back to the cooling tower floor . > There it is collected by a cleaning crew using shop vacs and is then > reformed into pellets for reactor use the next day .

Thanks for straightening me out . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Wrong , if a bunch of faggots from the tenderloin decide to go straight bashing and they selectively target a heterosexual man and beat the bloody fuck out of him , they would get charged as well under all the federal laws that exist about violation of civils rights . The focus of their intent is his sexual orientation , and so the law applies to them as well . The national government retains the right to make any laws necessary to sufficiently deter and punish any crime against someone 's civil rights until that behavior becomes so well punished that nobody even tries it ! The fact is , that at last count , gays were not beating straights for their sexual orientation . Thus , the law is getting applied only to the straights who indulge themselves . The federal government or judiciary has the right to enforce the 14th amendment guarantee of equal protection under law even if it takes 1000 possible charges against people who would violate them .

I also realize that Yasser Arafat renounced the _Covenant_ *to the Western media only* but he has yet to inform the PNC officially and enequivocally of his exact intentions on this issue . Therefore , as far as we are concerned the _Covenant_ still stands as the `` Bible '' ( so to speak ) of the mainstream Palestinian National movement ! > ( Pro Israeli activists repeat it like parrots without checking its authenticity > since it was coined by Bnai Brith ) As a staunch pro-Israel activist I can confidently say that Bnai Brith has NOT influenced my opinions on the Arab-Israeli conflict .

A negative situation I presume ? Is this the same '' situation '' when the Jordanian occupiers of East Jerusalem would not allow the Jews to go worship at the HOLIEST SITE IN JUDIASM ? Was this an example of Qu'ranic law being exercised ? If not , I have another suggested reading for you ... get into the `` soc.culture.arabic '' newsgroup where the posters have been debating the topic `` Jews in the Qu'ran '' ( and may I remind you the people doing the debating appear to be devout Muslims with some knowledge of the Qu'ran ) . You will find that Jews are n't really viewed positively by the Qu'ran ( to put it lightly ) . So how do you think Jews ( or any other non-Islamic religion ) will be treated by an Islamic state governed by the words of the Qu'ran ? I think the 1948-1967 `` situation '' in Jerusalem will return *at best* ! What do you think ? > However , whoever committed crimes against humanity ( torture , blowing up their > homes , murders , ... ) must be treated and tried as a war criminal .

All I have to say to that is , once again , see s.c.a - `` Jews in the Qu'ran '' and think again . `` Freedom of choice '' is *definitely* not an option in Qu'ranic law especially for non-Muslims and ALL women ! Remember the Gulf War ? I 'm sure you saw the reports about how women had few rights in Saudi Arabia ( an Islamic state ) . > > As for the PLO , I am at a loss to explain what is going inside Arafat 's mind . > Probably nothing !

However this does n't mean that the presence of those > witnesses is optional , except in odd situations like the standard > desert island . -- clh ] I originally wrote to the person who asked this question personally , but decided to post the information I had on the topic . I spoke to the pastor of my parish ( Catholic ) recently , by coincidence , on this subject . His explaination was that while it is possible for a couple to marry without the presence of a priest , it is important to have it recognized by the Church as soon as it is possible . Because the Church recoginizes itself as a community of believers , members of the church , to some degree , are to be held accountable to each other . To be less hypothetical than that mythical couple on the desert island , there are many places in the world that do not have priests availible for marriages on a regular basis . Therefore , couples get married without the priest being present , but get the priest to testify to their marriage when one comes through the area . I remember a religion teacher in high school saying that the marriage ceremony is not for the benefit of the couple as much as it is for the benefit of the community . Thus , married couples have some responsibility to the community to stay married , as divorce sets a bad example for the community . Also , the couple has vowed to become one with one another -- the community should be able to rely on that couple to be as one . While couples may marry without witnesses , they may NOT get anulments without a priest present . An anulment is simply an admission of the church that what they had declared a marriage was not , in fact , a marriage at all , for whatever reason . So do n't start getting married in the back seat of a station wagon and giving yourselves anulments a half-hour later ! ! I tend to agree with the response back there that said couples become married as soon as they consumate their marriage , but I would add that couples should consider their marriage consumated if they have sex , whether or not they intended to be married , assuming they were both willing partners to the sexual act . The couple must be prepared to raise any children they may have as a result of that sexual act with the benefit of both parents . Sex IS a commitment , I believe , in God 's eyes . But I 'm digressing ... . God be with you , Malcusco

He fans on 25 % of goal mouth feeds , but he still has 36 goals after a terrible start and has been an examplary ( sp ? ) team captain throughout a tough couple of seasons . Honorable mention : Nick Kypreos and Mark Janssens . Probably more appropriate in the unsung heroes category than MVP , but Kypreos ( 17 goals , 320+ PIM ) has been the hardest working player on the team and Janssens is underrated as a defensive center and checker . I guess I place a greater emphasis on hard work than skill when determining value . Biggest surprise : Geoff Sanderson . He had 13 goals and 31 points last season as a center , then moved to left wing and has so far put up 45 goals and 80+ points . He now has a new Whaler record 21 power play goals , most all coming from the right wing faceoff circle , his garden spot . Honorable mention : Andrew Cassels and Terry Yake . The kiddie quartet of Sanderson , Poulin , Nylander , and Petrovicky have been attracting the most attention , but Cassels is just 23 and will score close to 90 points this season . He has quite nicely assumed the role of number one center on the team and works very well with Sanderson . Yake bounced around the minors for a number of seasons but is still 24 and will put up about 20 goals and 50 points this season . Yake , like Sanderson , started performing better offensively once he was converted from center to wing , although lefty Sanderson went to the left wing and righty Yake went to the right side . Biggest disappointment : Hands down , John Cullen . Cullen had a disasterous 77 point season last year , his first full season after The Trade . Cullen started the season off of summer back surgery , and fell flat on his face ( appropriate , since he spent all of his Whaler career flat on his ass , and whining about it ) . Cullen scored just 9 point on 19 games , was a clubhouse malcontent , commanded the powerplay to a 9 % success percentage ( > 21 % with Sanderson ) , and sulked his way out of town . Worst of all , his 4 year , $ 4M contract had three years left to run , so no one would give up any more than the 2nd round draft pick the Maple Leafs offered to Hartford . Honorable mention : Steve Konroyd , also subpar after signing a 3 year , $ 2.1M contract ; Eric Weinrich , who showed flashes of competence , but overall has played poorly ; Jim McKenzie , who was a much better hockey player two seasons ago than he is now ; and Frank Pietrangelo , who only seemed to play well when Sean Burke was out for an extended period and he got to make a number of starts in a row . -SG ( a real live Hartford Whalers season ticket holder ) -steveg @ cadkey.com

Of course , if you 're planning to pull a Rushdie then declaring one's leaving the religion is little to be concerned about compared to one's other plans . In Rushdie 's case , the one under discussion , one can . It is tragic that in _some_ `` Islamic '' countries this is so . There are , however , Islamic countries ( whose constitutions contains statements that Islamic law is to be incorporated ) , e.g . Kuwait , where one can freely make such statements without fear . > Not to mention that it has already been pointed out that Rushdie has said in > his books that he 's not a Muslim , and there have surely been enough readers of > his books to provide the appropriate number of witnesses . This story has become tiresome . The conditions are clear . If you care to make your point clear then make a chronology and show that he had made public statements about leaving Islam prior to his writing of _TSV_ . If he did make such statements then he should have made _that_ clear rather than trying to rejoin Islam or go on talking about his personal feelings . Gregg

This is simply what belief means . [ More stuff deleted ] This seems to be a pretty arogant definition of belief . My beliefs are those things which I find to be true based on my experience of the world . This experience includes study of things that I may not have experienced directly . But even then , I can only understand the studies to the extent to which I can relate what I study back to what I have experienced . Which means that by beliefs about God are directly related to my experience of God . Having experienced God , I try to make sense of that experience . I study religion and read the Bible .

From : fierkelab @ bchm.biochem.duke.edu ( Eric Roush ) Subject : Re : Young Catchers Article-I.D . : news.12799 Organization : Biochemistry Lines : 139 Nntp-Posting-Host : bruchner.biochem.duke.edu Since I was the one responsible for these divergent threads of approx . 40+ posts ( going back to : The Braves could be better off if an injury happens ) , I may as well inject a little more fuel to the flame ! 1 ) Back at the beginning of Spring Training , I though Lopez would make the squad easily . Olson was still recovering from his late-season injury ( knee , I believe ) , and there were questions as to whether he would be able to play before June . And then Berryhill was dinged up . I was looking forward to this , because I believe that Lopez can hit AND field the position . Before last season , he was the Braves `` Defensive Catcher '' prospect , while Brian Deak was the Braves `` Offensive Catcher '' prospect . Besides , Olson and Berryhill could n't hit their way out of a wet cardboard box , and do n't walk enough to be useful . But Olson recovered quickly , Berryhill recovered , and the Braves went with the two vets . I still say that if one of those two had been down at the start of the season , he would n't have gotten his job back . 2 ) There is a certain logic to keeping Olson and Berryhill around . After all , ML catchers are in short supply and suffer from wear and tear . There are teams out there without ONE average ML catcher ( California and Seattle come to mind ) . Certainly , trying to move Olson or Berryhill through waivers would be unlikely to work . Plus , you 'd have to eat that salary , which is n't huge , but isn't tiddleywinks either ( I think Olson 's at about $ 800,000 , Berryhill at $ 450,000 , but that 's only what I recall ) . 3 ) Yes , I think arbitration-eligibility may have a role to play in this also . What is it , that 5/6 of the 2+year players are n't eligible for arbitration ? Only the 1/6 that were on the roster the longest are eligible ? Of course , the system may change , but the extent of that change is not yet known . From a business standpoint , it may make sense to keep Lopez down until June/the first time Olson/Berryhill go on the DL . 4 ) I am still disappointed that Lopez is n't on the team . I still prefer to think of myself as a fan when it comes to the Braves , and the truth is that I 'd rather see our best team on the field , which , IMO , includes Lopez . Of course , today we play the Cubs . Hopefully , we wo n't need him . ; ) As for the Schuerholz/Cox conversation , I imagine it went like this : ( Remember , they 've BOTH been GM 's ) ( the following is not meant to be read by the humor-impaired ) Cox : OK , we 've sent Jones down . His fielding could be a little smoother . Besides , Blauser can hit OK and his fielding is better than it used to be . Schuerholz : Well , we 'll have to send Nieves down too . Deion just wo n't sign that baseball only contract . We ca n't count on him in October , so we have to keep Nixon around for the defense . Besides , Gorman 's not ready to give up on Billy Hatcher yet . Once Hatcher 's gone AND Deion signs , we can move Nixon for Frankie Rodriguez . That ought to give us some pitching depth in 1995 . Cox : Yep , that 'll be nice . Too bad Deion wo n't sign . OK , I 'll look for Nieves when Justice starts having Berry-Berry ... er , back problems again . Now , what about Klesko ? Schuerholz : Well , we 've still got to fork out another 1.5 mil for Bream . If we keep Klesko , we either lose the money or Cabrera . I keep dangling Sid in front of Dal Maxwell , but somehow he does n't seem to be the same GM . First Jeffries for Jose , and now Whiten for Clark ! If he gets rid of Brian Jordan , then I 'd HAVE to believe that he and Whitey Herzog switched bodies at the Winter Meetings ! Cox : OK , keep trying on Bream , and I 'll wait til the trading deadline for my Hunter/Klesko platoon . Maybe I can get a few extra at-bats for Cabrera while we wait . Try California ... if Snow starts slowly , maybe WhiteyDal will bite on Sid . And if that does n't work , then perhaps Sid 's knees could be `` persuaded '' to act up . There 's always the 15-day DL ! Mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha ! Schuerholz : What about Caraballo ? Cox : Well , he 's not that much better than Lemke . Maybe if he starts in Richmond , he 'll start walking more . Besides , if he 's going to be arbitration-eligible , better to stretch him out so that we actually get some value from him before he makes the big bucks . Schuerholz : Now , let 's see . That leaves Lopez . Cox : NOOOOO ! I got ta keep Lopez ! Sure , I did n't think Olson would recover this quickly . Maybe I can talk Caminiti into running into him again ? Schuerholz : Nope , Lopez has got ta go . You know that he 'll get $ 3 million in arbitration . May as well put it off that one extra year . Besides , until Olson 's shown his stuff a little bit , I ca n't trade him . Besides , Berryhill 's a left-handed hitter . You know how rare that is ? Cox : Do n't you mean a left-handed whiffer ? Pretty common , if you ask me . I mean , he made Pat Borders look good in the World Series . PAT BORDERS ! ! ! Schuerholz : Hey , you 're the one who would n't write Lopez into the lineup . Cox : Well , you 're the one who went out and got me Jeff Reardon ! Besides , I thought Lopez would n't be used to our pitching staff 's stuff . He got some time with them this spring ... looked pretty good . Come on , surely we only need to keep one stiff behind the plate ? Schuerholz : Yeah , but which stiff ? Whichever one we keep will be hurt by May . Cox : OK , OK , you made your point . Keep them both . Surely one of them will be on the DL by June at the latest . Then I can call up Lopez , and then we can win 110 games ! The Pennant ! THE WORLD SERIES ! I 'll be up there with John McGraw ! Casey Stengel ! Earl Weaver ! Oh , they laughed at me in Toronto , but have you ever had to deal with George Bell ? I 'll finally get my just reward ! Mwa-ha-ha-ha ! Schuerholz : Easy , Bobby . Have you been taking those '' happy pills '' left around by Chuck Tanner ? Why 'd you ever hire that guy anyhow ?

As i recall , if you selectively close your dominant eye , you will percieve that the image shifts . This will not happen if you close your other eye . I believe that which eye is dominant is related to handedness , but I ca n't recall the relation at the moment . -- Barry D.

Since we are talking in theory and opinion , then I 'll put in my $ .02 . First , a rebuttle . Personally , I love under-dogs . Unlike bandwagon jumpers , I abandon teams when they start winning . People that cheer for winners just because they are winners are insecure people who are afraid to be associated with something negative . > The political implications are simple .

That could be black women today , Asian > homosexuals tommorrow , and yes indeed , white men some yet to be determined > day when the balance of the pie has finally swung against that ( 39 % ) > minority . On this one point , I agree . The reason that people bash WASP 's is because they have been on top for a long time . Whoever is on top is going to oppress whoever is below them so that they can stay on top . If Hannibal had pushed on to Rome after his victory at Cannae we might all be bashing the blacks for oppressing us peacefull white people for all these centuries . I seriously doubt that if the blacks had conquered the world that they would have treated their colonies any better/worse than the whites did . The white race did some unspeakable things to the other races of the world . But they only did what any other conquering race would have done ( ie . Khan ) . The real question is , should we carry over that blame to the present generation who did n't participate in the crimes ? Would it do any good ? Has it done Bosnia any good ? They are fighting wars that stopped hundreds , even thousands , of years ago . My opinion is , if there are inequities now , then let 's change them . But do n't blame me for what my ancestors did . It would n't settle anything anyway . > Either way you go , the way of the Winner is no longer the way to be > popular - at least after you graduate from High School ( but you 'll still > be popular at High School reunions ) . But it beats being a Nerd , as I > would imagine Michael Douglas would now agree , and in the long run , it > is the only way to go . That 's where you are dead wrong . You do n't join up on a side just because they are winning . That makes you spineless . Winning , in high school and after high school , is still the best way to be popular , but it does n't make you right . All the best causes in history were loosing causes ( with only a couple exceptions ) . Winning only makes a difference to other people , not to yourself . And what good is the opinions of other people if they only care how you appear ( ie . a Winner ) .

I stated that I would not block a would-be passer . I would not block a would-be passer '' for their own good '' or for any reason other than I was prevented from doing so due to the traffic circumstance . I fail to see how deterring a passer under these circumstance would IN ANY WAY decrease YOUR chances of being involved in an accident , fatal or otherwise . In fact , I could imagine how blocking a would-be passer would actually INCREASE your chances of being `` offed '' or involved in an accident , especially if this `` passer '' is riding your bumper . Intentionally blocking a person riding your bumper is certainly NOT a `` wise driving practice '' , it only causes the jam to become more congested .

If I perceive that I am rapidly closing on a `` pack '' of vehicles , I try to avoid getting caught up in situation such as you decribe . Usually either traffic is just building and I have to deal with this fact of life , or I wait to a slow passer to complete their pass and make way for the pack to clear . If someone decides then to pull up on my bumper , I signal my intention to move to the right , and do so at the first opportunity ( & hope they will open the jam ) . I feel this is not only courteous driving , but ALOT safer than the actions you advocate ! ! ! There are actually many courteous drivers on the road who do not intentionally impede others . If someone in front of me seems to be oblivious to the fact that they are blocking traffic I use my blinker or flash my lights , or , if all else fails , will briefly speed up /slow down so they MIGHT get the message that I am a faster vehicle trying to pass . I feel it is never safe to ride anyone 's bumper . IF someone is intentionally blocking traffic , because they feel that it is civil duty or philosophic duty or for some unfathomable reason , I feel they deserve , at the very least , derision . ( Sorry this is soooooooo long . )

I especially hate it when you flash someone at > the back of a line and they do n't 'pass it on ' . So after I 've flashed my lights at the chap in front and he doesn't 'pass it on ' ( and few if any do ) , what next ? On major highways , 3 or more lanes in each direction , keeping to the extreme right blocks folks who are entering . Also , as someone posted in this thread , here in the D.C. area we have a few left lane exits ( sounds like 66 ) . If you wait until the last minute to get in the left lane you wo n't , cause these yoyos wo n't make room . We have a particularly bad strech here in Merryland just over the Cabin John bridge . There are two very long entry ramps which all the hurry-up yahoos dive into cause they want to get ahead . When we get to the point where these ramps merge , all hell breaks lose . The result is that traffic which was moving at 55 on the VA side of the bridge , stalls on t'other side . If these dingbats had stayed in lane , allowed the folks coming up the two ramps to merge , we would still be doing 55 . Instead we do start- stop for 4 miles . Dave Barry 's idea of a laser equipped car would be real useful here . Bob PS : If you drive the beltway and want to merge , look for a brown Probe with a silver haired driver , then use your signals - I do n't read minds , but I do try to be courteous . They told me courtesy was contagious , but I guess the folks around here have had their shots : -/

From the material we covered last term ( in 10 weeks ) of Ge/Ch 127 ( Nuclear Chemistry ) , I could *derive* what it would take to build a bomb .

The electronics behind the detonator and the shaped charges are a little trickier , however . . . but not impossible using a few `` tricks of the trade .

Following precedent in other areas , the government is likely to put a tax on encryption technology . Once the tax is imposed , it becomes a federal matter and suspicision of an unlicensed cryptographic tool will bring the BATF or FBI tossing grenades into your house . ( The BATF appears to be the logical agency to enforce such regulations : federal control over alocohol , tobacco , and firearms is similary based on taxes . ) Look at the FCC : they wo n't allow sale of any receiever that can receive bands that are supposed to be private .

However the paragraphs above seem to repeat uncritically the standard Kuhn/Lakatos/Feyerabend view of `` progress '' and '' rationality '' in science . Since I 've addressed these issues in this newsgroup in the not too distant past , I wo n't go into them again now . What is wrong with the above observation is that it explicitly gives the impression ( and you may not in fact hold this view ) that the common ( perhaps even the `` correct '' ) approach for a scientist to follow is to sit around having flights of fancy and scheming on the basis of his jealousies and petty hatreds . It further at least implicitly advances the position that sciences goes `` forward '' ( and it is not clear what this means given the context in which it occurs ) by generating in a completely non-rational and even random way a plethora of hypotheses and theories that are then weeded out via the `` critical function '' of science . ( Though why this critical function should be less subject to the non-rational forces is a mystery . If experimental design , hypotheses creation , and theory construction are subject to jealousies and petty hatreds , then this must be equally true of the application of any `` critical function '' concerning replication . This is what leads one ( ala Feyerabend ) to an `` anything goes '' view . ) True , the generation part *can* be totally irrational . But typically it is *not* . Anecdotes concerning instances where a hypothesis seems to have resulted in some way from a dream or from one 's political views simply do not generalize well to the actual history of science . -- Gary H.

From : jamie @ zikzak.apana.org.au ( Jamie Scuglia ) Subject : Workspace Managers for Win 3.1 - a small review Organization : Zikzak Public Access UNIX , Melbourne Australia Lines : 56 NNTP-Posting-Host : zikzak.apana.org.au Thanks to all those people who recommended Workspace managers for Windows 3.1 . I found 3 shareware Workspace Managers , from Australia's MS-WINDOWS archive ( monu6.cc.monash.edu.au ) , which mirrors some sites in the U.S . The three I found were : 1 . WORKSPACES 1.10 ( wspace.zip ) This was the smallest and simplest of the workspace managers that I found . It is very easy to use . It displays a small window , containing 6 buttons , plus an extra button for configuration purposes . One annoying feature was the title window that is first presented when it is run - you must press a key ( not a mouse button ! ) for the thing to go away . Also , it would have been nice if there was an `` ALWAYS ON TOP '' setting for the little window containing the workspace buttons . Maybe some user-specified strings on the buttons instead of the numbers one to six might be a nice feature . The simplicity and ease of use of this workspace manager makes it an attractive package . 2 . WORKSHIFT 1.6 ( wrksft16.zip ) While this workspace manager offered a few features that WORKSPACES 1.10 lacked , it was quite time consuming to set things up . With WORKSPACES 1.10 , all but the first workspace is initially empty . With WORKSHIFT 1.6 , you need to take `` snapshots '' of how you want each of your workspaces to look like - i.e . what applications they contain . Also , the main window is quite large , but this does allow you to have a small view of what is in each workspace . With WORKSPACES 1.10 , there was no facility for viewing what was in a workspace without switching to it . WORKSHIFT 1.6 provides this viewing functionality which is quite useful . 3 . BIGDESK 2.30 and BACKMENU ( backdesk.zip ) This is an interesting package , which contains a few other goodies as well as a workspace manager . Other goodies include `` Backmenu '' , which provides a pop-up root menu when you press a certain mouse button - just like in X-Windows . The menu is totally configurable , offering unlimited depth of cascading menus , which is provides quite handy access to applications . You could say it is a menu-based alternative to the program manager . Also bundled in `` backdesk.zip '' is a program called `` WRUN '' , which allows you to run windows applications from a DOS shell under WINDOWS instead of using the File Manager to run applications . The actual workspace manager is called BIGDESK 2.30 . BIGDESK works quite differently to the other two workspace managers in that it does n't provide a certain number of disjoint and separate workspaces . In fact , it basically enlarges your desktop by a configurable amount , and you choose which region of the desktop you want your screen to focus in on . This means you can have windows overlapping between different viewing regions , unlike the first two workspace managers in which each workspace was isolated from the other one . The BIGDESK control window allows to to move windows around your enlarged desktop . Basically the control window provides a small scale view of your viewing area while your actual computer screen provides a large scale or blow-up of a particular section . Try each of them out for yourself . I was impressed with all of them , so find out which one suits your needs the best .

Why doing it in such a rough manner ? It is much more professional to steal the chip from the phone and even to replace it with a pin-compatible do-nothing chip that does not encrypt at all . Chances are that the victim will not notice anything , especially if it is done professionally . > Once a suitable collection of devices is stolen , criminals can communicate > with impunity ( assuming the cipher system carries no trapdoors apart from > key escrow ) until and unless the compromise is discovered by some other means . No , because the Feds will still be able to decrypt the conversations . True , they 'll blame the wrong guys , but nevertheless one can not say something like `` The drugs arrive tommorrow on the ship 'Terminus ' '' when the Feds are listening , even if they can not identify who the speaker is . No , the criminals will just use some secure encryption . The new proposal does not stop criminals ; it ensures that the government will be able to wiretap the average citizen and stops the casual snooper .

Yes , but then someone would have no problem draining your oil in a parking lot . all they have to do is reach underneath , turn a valve , and forget the trip home . But there is less likelyhood they have a wrench with them . I personally recommend , installing a 'special ' locking drain plug to keep vandals away . : -- - ) steve

The ability to program was > an entry requirement . At Robert Gordon University , programming was the main ( most time-consuming ) start of the course . The first two years consisted of five subjects : Software Engineering ( Pascal/C/UNIX ) , Computer Engineering ( 6502/6809/68000 assembler ) , Computer Theory ( LISP/Prolog ) , Mathematics/Statistics and Communication Skills ( How to pass interviews/intelligence tests and group discussions e.g . How to survive a helicopter crash in the North Sea ) . The third year ( Industrial placement ) was spent working for a computer company for a year . The company could be anywhere in Europe ( there was a special Travel Allowance Scheme to cover the visiting costs of professors ) . The fourth year included Operating Systems ( C/Modula-2 ) , Software Engineering ( C/8086 assembler ) , Real Time Laboratory ( C/68000 assembler ) and Computing Theory ( LISP ) . There were also Group Projects in 2nd and 4th Years , where students worked in teams to select their own project or decide to work for an outside company ( the only disadvantage being that specifications would change suddenly ) . In the first four years , there was a 50 % :50 % weighting between courseworks and exams for most subjects . However in the Honours year , this was reduced to a 30 % :70 % split between an Individual Project and final exams ( no coursework assessment ) - are all Computer Science courses like this ? BTW - we started off with 22 students in our first year and were left with 8 by Honours year . Also , every course is tutored separately .

I ca n't tell if Matt is being sarcastic here or not , but to be honest , many automobiles are worth far more to their owners ( in $ $ value and $ $ investment ) than the people that would take them . I do n't have figures on average property tax in the U.S. or how much of it is allocated for housing projects , inferior public schools , jails , or the like , but I have a feeling that the amount the government steals from an honest , productive citizen to breed this trash is significantly less than the value of many automobiles . And for those who will argue that the animals out there stealing cars and everything else ( not to mention committing COMPLETELY senseless acts of violence , such as rape ) can not be valued in terms of money because they are human beings , I submit that they are not human beings . Jim Callison , I think , is on the right track . And Chintan Amin remarked earlier that we can not blame environment for the actions of a single criminal . I could n't agree more . One could trace any crime back to the environment/upbringing of the criminal ; should we let all of them out , from pickpockets to rapists to inside traders , because what they did wasn't their fault ?

My 2 cents worth : The speaker connector should have two wires going to the speaker . A speaker being a coil , it 's bidirectional and makes no difference which way you attach . Turbo switch . There are three wires to control how you want turbo to become active- with the switch pushed in or the switch out . I think the middle wire is common . Use an ohm meter to figure out which wire connects with the common wire when the switch is pushed in , and which two wires are connected when the switch is out . Place the appropriate two wires on the turbo berg connector of the motherboard . LED 's : ( Turbo and HD ) LED 's are uni directional . Depending which way the wires are attached the LED will not light . On my AMI motherboard , if the turbo switch wires are not attached to the berg connector on the board , the board will power up in default in Turbo mode . If your motherboard is like that ... just attace the LED wires to the board . If the LED doesn't light , power off , reverse the connectors and try again . It should work . If it does , then attach the turbo switch to the board . Hope this helps . Dan Moyer Dan.Moyer @ ColumbiaSC.NCR.COM

Your 2F2 cap will have been designed as a RAM battery substitute , rather than for use in applications where you wish to drain the cap with a constant current . Their performance , in some respects , is more akin to batteries than to a normal cap . The other point is that big electro 's are usually rated with -5 % +20 % tolerances , so calculating exactly what capacitance you have ( particularly when considering the cold ) . You should be looking at designing a micropower oscillator and divider chain , that `` rolls over '' ( from zero to maximum count , or vice-versa ) once every 1,209,600 seconds . If you were to use something like a 110Hz clock , you would need a divider chain of 2^27 , to give an error of less than one percent in the firing times over the six week period . Of course , you could trim the 110Hz oscillator to give you exact time , but the likelyhood of the oscillator remaining exactly constant at -40 is low anyway . I would suspect that there would be far more battrey drain in firing the solenoid than there would be in the timer circuit . Caveat - I 'm not experienced in low temperature electronics , so I can't guarantee that this ( or any other ) approach is the best for inhospitable conditions .

An atheist is one for whom all things can : be understood as processes of nature - exclusively . This definition does not include all atheists ( see the FAQ ) . However , I ( for one ) do think there is no need to invoke any divine or spiritual explanations . It makes a big difference to claim that all things can be understood as natural processes , and to claim that our observations do not require us to postulate any divine intervention , or anything spiritual , for that matter . Humans are not omnipotent , and neither is science . However , science has one advantage theology does n't : it is self- correcting , with nature as its judge . It is delightful to see how scientific inquiry is revealing a self- consistent , simple picture of our universe . Science is no longer a bunch of separate branches , it is one . From particle physics to psychology . And no aspect of our life , or our universe , is safe from its stern and stony eye . Not even our consciousness . There is no need : for any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything . There is : no purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by : physics , chemistry , biology , etc . ; everything is random , nothing is : determnined . Actually , determinism vs. indeterminism is a philosophical question , and science can not say whether the whole thing is actually somehow superdeterministic or not . I think the question does not have any meaning , as far as individual human beings go . If their apparent free will is an illusion , it does not appear to be so from their perspective . Bill , can you say _for sure_ whether you have a free will or not ? : This would also have to include human intelligence of course and all : its products . There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it : acquire intelligence , it 's just a happy accident . Maybe . Who are we to tell ? It seems intelligence is useful - when during the history of Earth has _one species_ been able to control one third of the whole biosphere ? This can still be a result of numerous happy accidents our genetic machinery blindly replicates and preserves . Even that machinery can be result of the same principle - only the systems that can start replicating will survive , those which do n't do n't make it . ( Recommended reading : t.o ) : For an atheist , no : event can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less : value than another in any naturalistic sense , and no thought -about- : an event can have value . From whose perspective ? I value events and things subjectively , from my perspective . Nature does not have values , because it does not have a perspective - values arise from awareness . If I have a subjective perspective , it is easy to assume that other people also do , and if I think about what it would it be like in their position , I will eventually discover the Golden Rule . Morality is not necessarily a gift from heavens , in fact , it may be a product of evolution . Perhaps we are aware of ourselves because a sense of identity is helpful , allows us to play the roles of others and make us respect others who seem to have identity , too . Bill , have you ever read Aristotle ? Try his Ethica Nikomakhea ( sp . ) for starters . : How then can an atheist judge value ? What is the basis for criticizing : the values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God ? On : what grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned ? It : seems that , in judging the values that motivate others to action , you : have to have some standard against which conduct is measured , but what : in nature can serve that purpose ? What law of nature can you invoke to : establish your values . C.S . Lewis tells us that this argument was the main reason why he abandoned his atheism and became Christian . The argument is severely flawed . Some values , such as the Golden Rule , can have a rational basis . Some others , like the basic idea of wanting to live , has probably its roots in the way our brains are wired . Lewis ignored the very real possiblity that natural selection could also favour altruistic behaviour , and morality as well . Indeed , as humans evolved better and better in building and using tools , they also became better at killing each other . It is a logical necessity that evolution could only favour those who knew how to use tools , but not against one's own people . The Bible reveals quite nicely that the morality of the early Jews was not beyond this . A simple set of rules to hold the people together , under one god . Their god did not care much about people of other nations . At the time of the NT , things were quite different - the Jews were under rule of an _empire_ , and could no longer simply ignore the Gentiles . A new situation required a new morality , and along with it a new religion was born . ( A mutation in a meme pool . ) : Since every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event , what : difference could it possibly make what -anyone- does , religious or : otherwise , there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value . The only : way an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that the : objection is entirely subjective and that he ( she ) just does n't like it : - that 's it . Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer : that it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries : no weight in any `` absolute '' sense . It looks like you have n't bothered to read philosophy . Whenever there is an observer , there is a subjective point of view , which may value its existence and happiness ( even if that were just a result of some physical event ) , and other 's happiness , too , if the observer comes to think about it . In an absolutely objective sense , that is , without any observers or subjects , moral judgments lose their meaning . It is not possible for a value to simply exist without a point of view . This includes gods , too , their values are only _their_ personal judgments , not absolute truths , since such truths do not exist . The fact that most people do not deliberately want to hurt others is a manifestation of the way we have fought for our existence by becoming social beings who can think and value others' existence . Morality is not property of humans alone - chimps , dolphins and many other species show great care for each other . Dolphins have sometimes saved humans from drowning , a good deed indeed . : That you do n't like what God told people to do says nothing about God : or God 's commands , it says only that there was an electrical event in your : nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled : with a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction . That your : objections -seem- well founded is due to the way you 've been : conditioned ; there is no `` truth '' content . The whole of your : intellectual landscape is an illusion , a virtual reality . The last statement does not logically follow . In fact , there is every reason to believe our thoughts can model reality very well , and our senses can convey reliable information . Solipsism is still a logical possibility , but not a very likely one . You are continuously mixing two different views : the subjective point of view ( which we all share ) and an objective point of view , _which does not exist_ . Any observer or thinker , any personal being , has its own point of view . It does not matter whether this point of view is a result of some physical events or not , it does not cease to be subjective . From a non-observers non-point of view , values do not exist . Neither does pain , or pleasure , or beauty , or love . Such things are inherently subjective . Once again , if god wants wives to submit to their husbands , or even to make a leap of faith into the unknown , or wants to punish us if we do n't , I disagree with his morals . I do not think my morals come from any supreme being - to remove my morals means the same than to make me a zombie , a machine without a single thought . If god gave us morality to judge , but I disagree with him , it is not my fault . He is free to replace my morals . I can not see what is the point of giving someone a moral system which disagrees with one's own and then to get mad at this . God must be schizophrenic . : All of this being so , you have excluded : yourself from any discussion of values , right , wrong , goood , evil , : etc . and can not participate . Your opinion about the Bible can have no : weight whatsoever . Neither can the opinion of any god , for that matter . I can not understand why a subjective opinion of a thing made of matter is in any way less credible than an opinion of a thing made of something else . Bill , take note : Absolute values must be independent of _any_ being , _including_ gods . If god has a subjective viewpoint , it is his own point of view , and his morals are his own .

From : baalke @ kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov ( Ron Baalke ) Subject : SIRTF Mission is Still Alive Organization : Jet Propulsion Laboratory Lines : 114 Distribution : world NNTP-Posting-Host : kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov Keywords : SIRTF , JPL News-Software : VAX/VMS VNEWS 1.41 From the `` JPL Universe '' April 23 , 1993 SIRTF is still very much in business By Mark Whalen In these times of extra-tight NASA budgets , the very survival of a number of missions has been uncertain . But thanks to major design refinements implemented in recent months , JPL's Space Infrared Telescope Facility ( SIRTF ) -- a major project considered to be in trouble a couple of years ago -- is `` alive and well , '' according to Project Scientist Michael Werner . A lighter spacecraft , revised orbit and shorter mission have added up to a less expensive project with `` tremendous scientific power '' and a bright future , said Werner . Designed as a follow-up to the highly successful Infrared Astronomical Satellite ( IRAS ) and Cosmic Background Explorer ( COBE ) missions , SIRTF -- a cryogenically cooled observatory for infrared astronomy from space -- is scheduled for launch in 2000 or 2001 if plans proceed as scheduled . IRAS ' pioneering work in space-based infrared astronomy 10 years ago allowed astronomers to view the Milky Way as never before and revealed , among other things , 60,000 galaxies and 25 comets . It provided a sky survey 1,000 times more sensitive than any previously available from ground-based observations . COBE has measured the infrared and microwave background radiation on large angular scales , and revealed new facts about the early universe . But to illuminate SIRTF 's potential , Jim Evans , JPL's manager of Astrophysics and Fundamental Physics Pre-Projects , recently said that the project is `` 1,000 to 1 million times more capable than IRAS , '' based on technological advances in infrared detector arrays . However , despite the enormous strides in infrared exploration SIRTF promised , and the fact that it was cited as the highest priority new initiative for all of astronomy in the 1990s ( by the National Academy of Sciences ) , it took a `` diet or die '' directive from NASA Headquarters last year to keep the project going , according to Werner . The project is now known as Atlas SIRTF , based on the key factor in its new design : The satellite will orbit the sun instead of the Earth , permitting the use of an Atlas rocket launch instead of the formerly proposed and heavier Titan . `` The main advantage of the solar orbit is that you can use all of your launch capability for boosting the payload -- you do n't have to carry up a second rocket to circularize the orbit , '' Werner said . The other advantage to a solar orbit , he said , is that `` it 's in a better thermal environment , away from the heat of the Earth . '' Additional major changes in SIRTF 's redesign include shortening the mission from five to three years and building a spacecraft that is less than half as heavy as in the original plan -- Atlas SIRTF will weigh 2,470 kilograms ( 5,400 pounds ) compared to Titan SIRTF 's 5,500 kilograms ( 12,100 pounds ) . All of that adds up to `` a less stressful launch environment , '' Werner said , and a cost savings of more than $ 200 million for the launch , in addition to increased savings in the design of the smaller , less massive spacecraft . Werner said SIRTF 's redesign came as a result of Congress' telling NASA `` you 're trying to do too many things . If you want us to support SIRTF , which is a good project , develop a plan to see how it fits into ( NASA 's ) overall strategy . '' Shortly thereafter , SIRTF was named as NASA 's highest priority `` flagship '' scientific mission by the interdisciplinary Space Sciences Advisory Committee , in addition to the blessing from the National Academy of Sciences . While the spacecraft and its instruments required descoping to keep the project alive , SIRTF 's major scientific contribution always promised to come about from its advanced infrared detector arrays , which will allow images to be developed `` tens of thousands of times faster '' than before , according to Evans . `` Up until a couple of years ago , '' Werner said , `` all infrared astronomy was done with single detectors -- or very small arrays of individually assembled detectors . Since then , the Department of Defense has developed a program to produce arrays of tens or hundreds of thousands of detectors , rather than just a few , and those are very well suited for use on SIRTF . '' Werner noted that in addition to dealing with budget pressures , Congress is currently watching NASA projects with an eye out for any `` technological spinoff . '' `` On that question , I think we have some things to say , '' he said , `` because the detectors we 're using are straight off various military developments . Also , SIRTF will be built by the U.S. aerospace industry , and it 's a real technological and engineering challenge in addition to being a tremendous scientific project . `` SIRTF will be used by the entire astronomical community , '' Werner added , but the revised three-year mission `` puts a premium on observing time . We have to educate the user community and develop a program that involves early surveys and quick turnaround of the data . '' Werner said the downsizing of the project required a reduction in scope and complexity of SIRTF 's three instruments -- the infrared spectrograph , infrared array camera and multiband imaging photometer . However , these reductions will only result in losses of efficiency rather than capability , he said . The project hopes to start a `` Phase B '' activity in 1995 , which will provide a detailed concept for development and design . Building the hardware would begin about two years later . Projected cost estimates , Evans said , are $ 850 million- $ 950 million . `` I am very optimistic about SIRTF , '' he said . `` It will provide a tremendous return for the investment . '' Werner added that an additional benefit from the project will be the `` enrichment of our intellectual and cultural environment . People on the street are very interested in astronomy ... black holes , the possibility of life on other planets , the origin of the universe ... and those are the kind of questions SIRTF will help answer .

Well , if they were Satanists , or followers of an obscure religion , then I would be sure that Christians would in unison condemn and make this to a show case .

No . That 's *not* what I was complaining about , nor did I intend to suggest that DEC was any better than SGI ( let me tell you about the Lynx some day , but be prepared with a large sedative if you do ... ) . My comment regarding DEC was to indicate that I might be open to other vendors that supported OpenGL , rather than deal further with SGI . What I *am* annoyed about is the fact that we were led to believe that we *would* be able to upgrade to a multiprocessor version of the Crimson without the assistance of a fork lift truck . I 'm also annoyed about being sold *several* Personal IRISes at a previous site on the understanding *that* architecture would be around for a while , rather than being flushed . Now I understand that SGI is responsible to its investors and has to keep showing a positive quarterly bottom line ( odd that I found myself pressured on at least two occasions to get the business on the books just before the end of the quarter ) , but I 'm just a little tired of getting boned in the process . Maybe it 's because my lab buys SGIs in onesies and twosies , so we are n't entitled to a `` peek under the covers '' as the Big Kids ( NASA , for instance ) are . This lab , and I suspect that a lot of other labs and organizations , does n't have a load of money to spend on computers every year , so we ca n't be out buying new systems on a regular basis . The boxes that we buy now will have to last us pretty much through the entire grant period of five years and , in some case , beyond . That means that I need to buy the best piece of equipment that I can when I have the money , not some product that was built , to paraphrase one previous poster 's words , 'to fill a niche ' to compete with some other vendor . I 'm going to be looking at this box for the next five years . And every time I look at it , I 'm going to think about SGI and how I could have better spent my money ( actually *your* money , since we're supported almost entirely by Federal tax dollars ) . Now you 'll have to pardon me while I go off and hiss and fume in a corner somewhere and think dark , libelous thoughts . spl -- Steve Lamont , SciViGuy -- ( 619 ) 534-7968 -- spl @ szechuan.ucsd.edu San Diego Microscopy and Imaging Resource/UC San Diego/La Jolla , CA 92093-0608 '' My other car is a car , too .

Support for the BusLogic cards is not included with OS/2 2.0 any longer . If you wish to install the beta from the CD/ROM , you will need to REM out the Adaptec device drivers , as they have a nasty tendency to crash the BusLogic cards when OS/2 attempts to use them . ( Thanks Adaptec ! ) So you add the BusLogic drivers to the config.sys on the CD-ROM boot disk , and REM out the Adaptec drivers . Then you install the whole 1st half of the Beta.. and it wo n't work ! IBM nicely copies in the Adaptec drivers once again . ( Thanks IBM ! ) So.. REM out the Adaptec drivers once more.. and reboot . If you have everything in the right order.. it will work . Things are pretty smooth through the rest of the installation.. except OS/2 will try to install the Adaptec SCSI drivers once again at the end ... so.. you are off to more REM statements and more fun . The BT 542Bk comes with drivers and costs the same as the Adaptec cards that do not come with drivers . The DOS drivers work great . This card can easily be configured to work with 8 different sets of I/O ports ( and you can use multiple host adapters in one machine ) If you get a new card.. it will also be able to support up to 8 GB drives under DOS .

No , gravity is an inherent system . You do n't need any excess information other than observations to determine anything . It is possible to objectively determine someone 's guilt or innocence within an non-inherent system . I agree that morality is not necessarily inherent ( unless you state that everything we do has an evolutionary basis ) , but this does not mean that it can not be objective in theory . > This `` natural morality '' is not an objective system , as evidenced by > your comments about lions , and mine . Perhaps it can be objective , but not inherent . Anyway , as I noted before , the practices related to mating rituals , etc . among the animals are likely the only ones to be considered `` immoral '' under the previous `` definitions '' of the natural law . Therefore , some revisions are in order , since the class of activities surrounding mating seem to pose some general problems . > > And in fact , the only way that the postulates could be determined by an > > outsider would be if there were some sort of higher truth , like some > > sort of god or something .

Israelis top leaders in the past and present , always come across as arrogant with their tough talks trying to intimidate the Arabs . The way I see it , Israelis and Arabs have not been able to achieve peace after almost 50 years of fighting because of the following two major reasons : 1 ) Arab governments are not really representative of their people , currently most of their leaders are stupid , and/or not independent , and/or dictators . 2 ) Israeli government is arrogant and none comprising .

Does anyone have first hand knowledge on this ? I > will also check it out , but this is 7am Sunday so I did not want to wait . Ok , so there are in fact two distinct components transmitted by the chip ; the real message encrypted with the `` conventional '' key , and the serial number and encrypted `` conventional '' key encrypted with the ( IMHO kind of bogus , as the whole concept of `` one key that millions of people use which ca n't be changed '' does n't seem reasonable ) `` family key '' . Suppose I analyze the output of this chip and I 'm able to determine which bits are the encrypted packet which contains the serial number and session key . Suppose I also design a simple algorithm based on this information which takes the data containing the encrypted session key and twiddles a bit ( or several ) before it 's sent down the line . Mind you , I 'm sure the NSA thought of this along with a dozen other attacks I ca n't imagine , and the system is probably somehow designed so that manipulation of this information will cause a compliant receiving chip to somehow fail to decrypt successfully . But how ? What if the two parties agree in advance on some kind of consistent bit-twiddling scheme , so the decryption chip sees the restored '' proper '' bitstream but an eavesdropper gets a E [ K ; UK ] packet that's wrong ? I suppose this could be easily defeated if the chip `` sends '' that information out many times in slightly different ways , making it effectively impossible to be certain you know all the information being sent . -- Marc VanHeyningen mvanheyn @ cs.indiana.edu MIME & RIPEM accepted If your theory predicts different outcomes depending on whether you use discrete mathematics or continuous mathematics , then you 've got the wrong theory . - Bruce MacLennan

If possible ( last I heard , it was out of print but they were considering reprinting ) read Barbara Hambly 's _Search the Seven Hills_ . It is historical fiction , set in Rome at the time of the early Church . She captures the weirdness of the early Christians and yet gives glimpses of the holiness too . Some of their odd views make a lot more sense in the context of the society they lived in . I found it a remarkably positive view of Christianity considering that the author is not a Christian herself .

In other > words technically speaking Christians should use Saturday and not Sunday > as their holy day , if they want to conform to the teachings of Jesus . I think the passage you 're looking for is the following . Matthew 5:17 `` Think not that I have come to abolish the law and the prophets ; I have come not to abolish them but to fulfil them . Matthew 5:18 For truly , I say to you , till heaven and earth pass away , not an iota , not a dot , will pass from the law until all is accomplished . Matthew 5:19 Whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches men so , shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven ; but he who does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven . Matthew 5:20 For I tell you , unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees , you will never enter the kingdom of heaven . There are several problems with this . The most serious is that the Law was regarded by Jews at the time ( and now ) as binding on Jews , but not on Gentiles . There are rules that were binding on all human beings ( the so-called Noachic laws ) , but they are quite minimal . The issue that the Church had to face after Jesus ' death was what to do about Gentiles who wanted to follow Christ . The decision not to impose the Law on them did n't say that the Law was abolished . It simply acknowledged that fact that it did n't apply to Gentiles . This is a simple answer , which I think just about everyone can agree to . ( A discussion of the issue in more or less these terms is recorded in Acts 15 . ) However there 's more involved . In order to get a full picture of the role of the Law , we have to come to grips with Paul 's apparent rejection of the Law , and how that relates to Jesus ' commendation of the Law . At least as I read Paul , he says that the Law serves a purpose that has been in a certain sense superceded . Again , this issue is n't one of the abolition of the Law . In the middle of his discussion , Paul notes that he might be understood this way , and assures us that that 's not what he intends to say . Rather , he sees the Law as primarily being present to convict people of their sinfulness . But ultimately it 's an impossible standard , and one that has been superceded by Christ . Paul 's comments are not the world's clearest here , and not everyone agrees with my reading . But the interesting thing to notice is that even this radical position does not entail an abolition of the Law . It still remains as an uncompromising standard , from which not an iota or dot may be removed . For its purpose of convicting of sin , it 's important that it not be relaxed . However for Christians , it 's not the end -- ultimately we live in faith , not Law . While the theoretical categories they use are rather different , in the end I think Jesus and Paul come to a rather similar conclusion . The quoted passage from Mat 5 should be taken in the context of the rest of the Sermon on the Mount , where Jesus shows us how he interprets the Law . The `` not an iota or dot '' would suggest a rather literal reading , but in fact that 's not Jesus ' approach . Jesus ' interpretations emphasize the intent of the Law , and stay away from the ceremonial details . Indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitude towards the Sabbath and kosher laws . Some scholars claim that Mat 5:17-20 needs to be taken in the context of 1st Cent . Jewish discussions . Jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving a tenth of even the most minor herbs , but neglecting the things that really matter : justice , mercy and faith , and caring about how cups and plates are cleaned , but not about the fact that inside the people who use them are full of extortion and rapacity . ( Mat 23:23-25 ) This , and the discussion later in Mat 5 , suggest that Jesus has a very specific view of the Law in mind , and that when he talks about maintaining the Law in its full strength , he is thinking of these aspects of it . Paul 's conclusion is similar . While he talks about the Law being superceded , all of the specific examples he gives involve the '' ceremonial law '' , such as circumcision and the Sabbath . He is quite concerned about maintaining moral standards . The net result of this is that when Paul talks about the Law being superceded , and Jesus talks about the Law being maintained , I believe they are talking about different aspects of the Law . Paul is embroiled in arguments about circumcision . As is natural in letters responding to specific situations , he 's looking at the aspect of the Law that is currently causing trouble : the Law as specifically Jewish ceremonies . He certainly does not intend to abolish divine standards of conduct . On the other hand , when Jesus commends the Law , he seems to be talking the Law in its broadest implications for morals and human relationships , and deemphasizing those aspects that were later to give Paul so much trouble . It 's unfortunate that people use the same terms in different ways , but we should be familiar with that from current conflicts . Look at the way terms like `` family values '' take on special meaning from the current context . Imagine some poor historian of the future trying to figure out why `` family values '' should be used as a code word for opposition to homosexuality in one specific period in the U.S . I think Law had taken on a similar role in the arguments Paul was involved in . Paul was clearly not rejecting all of the Jewish values that go along with the term `` Law '' , any more than people who concerned about the `` family values '' movement are really opposed to family values .

From : smb @ research.att.com ( Steven Bellovin ) Subject : Clipper chip -- technical details Organization : AT & T Bell Laboratories Lines : 121 I received the following two notes from Martin Hellman with details on how Clipper will work . They are posted with his permission . The implications of some details are fascinating . -- -- -- - Date : Sat , 17 Apr 93 23:05:23 PDT From : `` Martin Hellman '' < hellman @ isl.stanford.edu > To : ( a long list of recipients ) Subject : Clipper Chip Most of you have seen the announcement in Friday 's NY Times , etc . about NIST ( National Institute of Standards & Technology ) announcing the `` Clipper Chip '' crypto device . Several messges on the net have asked for more technical details , and some have been laboring under understandable misunderstandings given the lack of details in the news articles . So here to help out is your friendly NSA link : me . I was somewhat surprised Friday to get a call from the Agency which supplied many of the missing details . I was told the info was public , so here it is ( the cc of this to Dennis Branstad at NIST is mostly as a double check on my facts since I assume he is aware of all this ; please let me know if I have anything wrong ) : The Clipper Chip will have a secret crypto algorithm embedded in Silicon . Each chip will have two secret , 80-bit keys . One will be the same for all chips ( ie a system-wide key ) and the other will be unit specific . I do n't know what NIST and NSA will call them , but I will call them the system key SK and unit key UK in this message . The IC will be designed to be extremely difficult to reverse so that the system key can be kept secret . ( Aside : It is clear that they also want to keep the algorithm secret and , in my opinion , it may be as much for that as this stated purpose . ) The unit key will be generated as the XOR of two 80-bit random numbers K1 and K2 ( UK=K1+K2 ) which will be kept by the two escrow authorities . Who these escrow authorities will be is still to be decided by the Attorney General , but it was stressed to me that they will NOT be NSA or law enforcement agencies , that they must be parties acceptable to the users of the system as unbiased . When a law enforcement agency gets a court order , they will present it to these two escrow authorities and receive K1 and K2 , thereby allowing access to the unit key UK . In addition to the system key , each user will get to choose his or her own key and change it as often as desired . Call this key plain old K. When a message is to be sent it will first be encrypted under K , then K will be encrypted under the unit key UK , and the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part message which will then be encrypted under the system key SK producing E { E [ M ; K ] , E [ K ; UK ] , serial number ; SK } When a court order obtains K1 and K2 , and thence K , the law enforcement agency will use SK to decrypt all information flowing on the suspected link [ Aside : It is my guess that they may do this constantly on all links , with or without a court order , since it is almost impossible to tell which links over which a message will flow . ] This gives the agency access to E [ M ; K ] , E [ K ; UK ] , serial number in the above message . They then check the serial number of the unit and see if it is on the `` watch list '' for which they have a court order . If so , they will decrypt E [ K ; UK ] to obtain K , and then decrypt E [ M ; K ] to obtain M. I am still in the process of assessing this scheme , so please do not take the above as any kind of endorsement of the proposed scheme . All I am trying to do is help all of us assess the scheme more knowledgably . But I will say that the need for just one court order worries me . I would feel more comfortable ( though not necessarily comfortable ! ) if two separate court orders were needed , one per escrow authority . While no explanation is needed , the following story adds some color : In researching some ideas that Silvio Micali and I have been kicking around , I spoke with Gerald Gunther , the constitutional law expert here at Stanford and he related the following story : When Edward Levi became Pres . Ford 's attorney general ( right after Watergate ) , he was visited by an FBI agent asking for `` the wiretap authorizations . '' When Levy asked for the details so he could review the cases as required by law , the agent told him that his predecessors just turned over 40-50 blank , signed forms every time . Levi did not comply and changed the system , but the lesson is clear : No single person or authority should have the power to authorize wiretaps ( or worse yet , divulging of personal keys ) . Sometimes he or she will be an Edward Levi and sometimes a John Mitchell .

( I already spend too much time answering too much e-mail and am particularly overloaded this week with other responsibilities . ) 2 . I note a probably correction sent to me by Dorothy Denning . She met with the person from NSA that I talked with by phone , so her understanding is likely to better than mine on this point : Where I said the transmitted info is E { E [ M ; K ] , E [ K ; UK ] , serial number ; SK } she says the message is not double encrypted . The system key ( or family key as she was told it is called ) only encrypts the serial number or the serial number and the encrypted unit key . This is not a major difference , but I thought it should be mentioned and thank her for bringing it to my attention . It makes more sense since it cuts down on encryption computation overhead .

He then discovered that they had miscalculated the tax & license by about $ 150 . He then said he needed another $ 150 from me . I said we had already agreed on a price and it was their problem , I was n't giving them any more money . The finance guy then brought in the manager on duty who proceeded to give me a hard time . I reminded him that I was the customer and I did n't think I should be treated like that and that if he did n't back off he could forget the whole deal . He made some smart remark so I told him where he could stick it , snatched back my check and left . Needless to say , they were not pleased by the turn of events . Early the next morning I got a call from the general sales manager wanting to know what happened . I related the story and he apologised profusely and asked if there was anything they could do to change my mind . I told him that if they gave me the truck for free I probably still would n't take it , that there were other dealers in town , I was a repeat customer of theirs and that they should learn how to treat customers , etc , etc ... I was still pretty steamed about the whole affair . He gave me the line about hating to lose a customer and they would try to find a solution , etc , etc . I told him not to bother , thanks , I 'd go somewhere else . A couple hours later , the owner of the dealership called me , all apologetic , etc , etc , etc , and said that they would cover the $ 150 plus knock another $ 400 off the price of the truck . I told him I 'd think about it and he gave me his private , direct phone number , his secretary 's name , and assured me that they valued me as a customer , etc etc etc ... . I thought about it for a few hours and discussed it with my wife and we decided , what the hell ... that was a pretty decent deal , so I called him back and accepted his offer . When I went back the next day to pick up the truck , I received the royal treatment . Everyone seemed to know about the incident , even the lot boy . Everything went smoothly and I was out of there in my new truck in about 30 mins . So , I guess I 'm a reasonably satisfied customer . However , it should not have happened in the first place . I was a bit shocked to have a sales person talk to me like that . I do n't expect them to bow and grovel , but I sure do n't expect to be given a hard time either , esp . when it 's their mistake . Anyway , I 'm happy with the truck and it turned out to be a couple hundred dollars under invoice and they paid most of the first year 's license fee . I 'm not sure whether I 'll go back to that dealer , tho . Mark

Atheists argue for abortion , defend homosexuality as a means of population control , insist that the only values are biological and condemn war and capital punishment . According to Benedikt , if something is contardictory , it can not exist , which in this case means atheists I suppose . I would like to understand how an atheist can object to war ( an excellent means of controlling population growth ) , or to capital punishment , I 'm sorry but the logic escapes me . And why just capital punishment , what is being questioned here , the propriety of killing or of punishment ? What is the basis of the ecomplaint ? Bill

I do n't think your objection is beyond the bounds of rationality . The right mentioned in the bill is already established under the Second Amendment ; the bill should be reworded to reaffirm the Second Amendment RKBA , and then establish the procedures for redress through the federal court system .
