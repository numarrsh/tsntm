Lines : 15 A local dealer is offering Mac II vi machines equipped with Kodak multi- session compatible CD-ROM drives for what seems like an attractive price : $ 1500 . I 've used many other models up to a II ci , but this would be the first I could have my own Mac . Is it safe to buy an about-to-be discontinued model such as this . I 'd like to yank the CD-ROM drive out , put it in a housing and share it with my PC . Is this feasible ? The only info I have on the II vi is that it is relatively slow ( 16MHz ) , has an 68030 chip with a math coprocessor . I want to add a non-Apple portrait monitor and use this machine for HyperCard stack design . Is this a good buy , or would I be wasting my money ? I would appreciate some advice . Thanks !

So far , the medical examiner ( according to the news ) has found NO EVIDENCE of gunshot wounds in bodies so far examined . If this continues to be the case , it will sort of shoot holes ( pun intended ) in the FBI story , would n't it ? And cartridges going off outside a firearm do not launch a bullet like they do when fired from a gun . The bullet hardly moves , it is the brass casing that goes flying , and then with less than lethal force . It will hurt , yes , but not KILL you - I doubt if it wil penetrate a coat , for example . How about an INDEPENDENT investigation , with full subpoena powers , and powers to prosecute on felony charges , to investigate for any possible illegal/criminal activity on the part of both the BATF and FBI ? I can not see any reason why not - to use the phrase they like to use so often , `` if they have nothing to hide ... '' they should welcome it , and vigorously support it .

I really think that this is the key point . When I saw the incident on Baseball Tonight Sunday , I could n't believe how far away from the plate Gant went . Then he casually leaned against his bat . I do n't blame the umpire at all for telling the pitcher to pitch . The worst part of the whole incident was the Braves coming out onto the field . What were they going to do , attack the umpire ? The only people who should 've been out there were Cox and maybe the coaches , but NO players .

People seem perfectly capable > dealing with these others . Well , yeah , but unlike TIFF they all do substantially more than encode rectangular bitmaps . And the others are hardly trouble free . I hear that it is quite common for CGM implementations not to interoperate . The annoying thing about TIFF is that is that along with the 50 useful options , there are 100 stupid options . The most egregious example is that rather than picking a byte order and bit order and using it consistently in all TIFF files , byte and bit order are options and all TIFF readers on all machines , no matter what their natural byte order , have to be prepared to do byte swapping . There are four slightly different FAX formats -- again , any one of them would have been adequate . RGB images can be stored by pixel or by component , complexity without function , etc , etc . I also note that the TIFF doc says that Aldus ' experiments show that LZW reliably compresses as well or better than any of the FAX formats , suggesting that none of the FAX formats are really useful . What 's worse , a lot of the formats are n't even implemented very well , e.g. , LZW limits code words to 12 bits , while 14 or 16 bits would have provided substantially better compression . And the LZW method compresses bytes rather than pixels . But the absolute worst thing about TIFF is that any vendor can register proprietary TIFF codes and formats without even publicly documenting them . This means that there is NO WAY to write a TIFF reader that can reliably read all incoming TIFF files . Some standard .

This is my own guess , based on similar designs flown on other large STS-launched s/c ( GRO , UARS ) .

However , to relate this to sports , only after I learned to not care about the score did I become a good basketball player . I had to learn to go all out no matter the situation . Perhaps this lesson is relevent . After all , only if I can give up my life can I keep it , only if I am humble can I achieve glory . Only if I concentrate on living my life now the best I can will I be afforded life eternal . I think you have illuminated the true meaning of `` saved by faith . '' But what is my answer ? Right now I would remain a Christian . However , was that always my answer ? That 's the problem . Heaven and hell are good motivators at certain stages of maturity . And I admit there are certain times when perhaps I bite my tongue and put up with something in the hope of a better day , i.e . I mentally trade present happiness for future happiness . I hope the cynics and skeptics do not read more into that than appropriate , but I am trying to be honest . ( Scott A Mayo ) writes : > Of course . But it is a pointless question , because you can not know > beyond all doubt that hell does not exist , anymore than you can know > it does , short of taking Jesus 's word for it . `` What If '' questions are > fun and entertaining , but probably fruitless . I think these kinds of questions are extremely fruitful . I guess it depends on how one views knowledge and learning . By stripping ideas to simple , straightforward , opposing concepts we can determine levels of importance . By analyzing the theoretically absurd we can gain a better understanding of the actually absurd . Chris Mussack

Big difference . That 's ignoring the question of how you fit a distribution to the Oort distribution when the Oort distribution is not well known - in particular comet aphelia ( which are not well known ) are not a good measure of the Oort cloud distribution ... Merging neutron stars is at least a mechanism with about the right energy , except it does n't explain why there is no apparent correlation with galaxies or galaxy structure , there is no mechanism for getting all the energy out in gamma rays ( with any significant amount of baryons around there will be a lot of pair production , which makes a plasma , which thermalizes the energy ) , it has trouble generating enough energy to explain the most powerful bursts ( 10^52-53 ergs ) , it happens too fast compared to the burst duration , and it is hard to make tight-binaries of neutron stars . Another cosmological mechinism is the catalytic conversion of a neutron star to a strange star or the merger of two strange stars , but that uses pretty far-out physics . My point is that we do n't have a good mechanism at any distance , so GRB 's are likely to be happening by an unknown mechanism , so we can't rule out the Oort cloud . What would be the spectrum of an event which converts a comet to strange matter ? The spectra for primordial black holes eating comets and antimatter comets colliding with matter comets are n't quite right , but perhaps there is an unusual mechanism which modifies the spectrum . The energy matches very well for both of these mechanisms . According to Trevor Weeks , if the `` Tunguska Meteorite '' was a mini-black hole collision with the earth , then there are likely to be enough mini-black holes around that the rate for BH-comet collisions matches the GRB rate well . The fact that we do n't know the distribution of comets in the Oort cloud is n't a reason to rule them out ; it makes it harder to rule them out . The point of the cited paper was that if we assume they got the right distribution for the Oort cloud , it is hard but not impossible to match that up with the distribution of GRB 's . If they got the wrong distribution for the Oort cloud , they ca n't constrain any Oort- cloud GRB 's at all . Executive summary : we do n't know enough to rule out out the Oort cloud .

Is there another newsgroup that ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ A > might have specifics on herbal remedies ? A > A > Robert Allison I tried to e-mail you , but our board is having internet problems , so I 'm not sure whether you got the information on rutin or not . Rutin is NOT a herb , but part of the bioflavonoid complex . You should generally *not* take rutin by itself , but take the whole bioflavonoid complex instead . If you do n't ( and there are some exceptions to that ) you 'll eventually create a hesperidin deficiency , which is the other major component of the bioflavonoid complex . I found out the hard way years ago when I recommended rutin , after it showed deficient in patients who were NOT deficient in hesperidin be- fore . A later retest almost always showed a subsequent deficiency in hesperidin , which , from then on , made me always *add* bioflavonoids to anyone that had *very* low levels of rutin . Most of the time people are equally low in rutin *and* hesperidin , so there is really no reason to take rutin by itself , but use the whole bioflavonoid complex instead . I have several thousand patients taking them with many claiming that they had been helped with hemorrhoids , varicose veins , chronic nose bleeds , aneurysms , gastro-intestinal bleeding ( due to drugs ) , etc ... One patient in desperation took a whole bottle ( 100 's ) in one day for his painful , bleeding hemorrhoids , without any ill effects . They are also non-toxic in very high amounts , that 's why they can be safely recommended . If you are allergic to citrus fruit ( they are made from their peels ) , pine bark sources are available as well . About 90 % of patients tested show a bioflavonoid deficiency , with the average daily dosage needed being about 1 - 2,000mg . For major complaints , 4 - 6,000mg+/day is common . In case they can not be taken , because of their size and taste ( they are big , and they do n't taste that great ) , a product made from pine bark extract gives you the same effect and the tablets are quite small and taste much better , however the cost is about seven times higher for the equivalent effect . One 25mg tablet of the pine bark extract gives you about the same effect as 1,000mg of bioflavonoids . The name for the pine bark product is 'Pycnogenol .

Wingate Maybe you should dig a little further Charles . Hislop 's scholarship was accepted by the Bristish Oriental Institute which , at the time , was the premere Institute for Oriental studies . As I 've stated over and over , I 've checked out about 25 % of his references ( most are now out of print or in private libraries ) and the likes of Wilkerson and Layard hold their own merit . THey too came to the same conclusions and if you will trouble yourself , you will find that their knowledge of the mysteries have yet to be surpassed . Both were highly honored by the British Oriental Museum . Wilkerson is known as one of the leading archeologist in the history of Egyptiology and Layard is still being refered two after 200 yrs of archeology in the Mesopotamian regions . He was recently refered to in a TIME article on Babylonian archeology . Phony scholarship is when you review their references and find that they have misquoted or misrepresented the conclusions . Hislop did not . His conclusions do not tickle the ears , that much is self evident . But to assert that his conclusions are `` spurious '' is without merit . He gave references to all his conclusions and as I have stated , for the last 25 years I have used his conclusions in debates at RC seminaries and brotherhoods , not to mention the individual priests and bishops that I have talked to one on one . No counter to Hislops scholarship was made . The only rebuttals were against his conclusions because they do totally undermined the claims of the RCC . He was showing that the intitution of the RCC was based on the mysteries ( which others have shown even to this day in various articles and topics ) . THe tongues movement in Corinth was a direct result of the mysteries entering into the church . If it was so in Corinth , why could they not have an influence in Rome , the city of seven hills ? Also , you do not have to listen to his conclusions , you can draw your own conclusions by looking at the customs , artifacts , the cerimonial dress , the docrine of purgatory , etc from the vantage of the mysteries . You do n't even have to be a believer to see the parallels . Just one example . THe mitre . Where did it come from ? Why is it shaped the way it is ? What are the two tails that hang down the back represent ? Was this an ancient head dress from an earlier culture and why was it in Rome at the time of the beginnings of the church of the State of Rome ? Does it have pagan history behind it , and if so , why did the RCC chose regardless ? Any lay person of middle eastern religion can answer these questions . Even the scriptures themselves refer to it . All Hislop did was collect the information from all the various sources and put them in one binding . There is no lack of scholorship in that . Please tell me why you discredit this man by your accusation , yet present no evidence supporting it . -- Rex

Our doctors ' monopoly is exactly the same as in the U.S. , if not more powerful now that they can dictate insurance payment rates , but I do n't know an answer to this one . Anecdotally , my friends who are MD 's ( including my main buds from high school ) talk about how hard it is to turn `` state 's witness '' against someone else ... no direct experience there , though . > Also , in some circumstances you may have to sue the insurance plan- > people here , after all , sue health insurance companies all the time . > I heard about a guy in Alberta who came down with some rare eye > disease that he had to take repeated trips to Seattle to get treated . > It cost him and his family something like $ 6000 and the province , > years later , still has only reimbursed them for $ 500 or so . Well , what American private insurance plans cover travel expenses ? ? ? Since our public insurance plans are publicly accountable , one can raise a stink in the media to try and extort benefits beyond which one is entitled ( hey , not Alberta 's fault that he lives there ) ...

It 's worth thinking about . It 's regular practice in a hospital to figure out who needs to get at what facilities . Do n't Americans have to arrange in advance for operations too ? I think that there are two standards being applied here , and that Canada ca n't give Beverly Hills-style treatment to everybody . It 's not a big brother list ... it 's more like calling around town for a table for dinner ... > Yeah , but private nonprofit foundations have to make money somehow , > especially in the hospital business . Yes , and the Tories in Ottawa are trying to make them do that rather than hope for a bigger grant from the feds and their province the next time around . Whether it 's using mop a couple of weeks longer or even selling services to Americans ( remember , our system is cash based and since our health care infrastructure is overbuilt except in specialties that require larger populations to generate business , why not ? The alternative is closing unused wards ... business. ) . > whether Canadians would be thrilled at the prospect of their own > health services catering toward Americans , who would be willing > to pay more than they do , is another issue entirely ) , it must be > noted that they said they were doing it partly because their grants > from the province were getting smaller If those grants are so > insubstantial , why the need to attract foreigners to make up the > difference ? You answered the question yourself ... `` private nonprofit foundations have to make money somehow '' , and I think that it 's about time that they acted like the private hospitals that they are . Personally , I 'm fed up with Canadian socialists trying to tell everyone that their health care is free when we are actually buying insurance ( that 's one at you , Bob Rae ! ! ) . > > The GDP figures are combined public and private expenditures for total > > outlay , and are compiled use the same methods by the OECD that yield > > the 13-14 % figure for the U.S. > > But do n't the US figures include dentistry and optometry where the > Canadian one ( until recently , anyway ) did n't ? Since we have always been evaluated in an OECD style , I do n't see how ... remember , OECD counts both private and public funds , and in Canada like France and Germany , 30 % of health care spending is private funds ( i.e. , not the basic health insurance money ) . > > > So what happens if the health care systems financially collapse . > > > > How ?

Yes , the infrastructure will be there . > But will everybody be able to continue using it at the same rate . Minor copayments can flush out abusers . Remember that our `` system '' is only an insurance policy . But our costs are n't rising fast enough to ensure adequate copayments/deductibles ... last year , Quebec 's user-fee proposal came out with the number of `` $ 5 '' as the necessary hike that could be done through a copayment rather than give the QMA a raise . And it 's not contract time yet , as far as I can tell from UPI Clarinet ... Even the new Reform Party , a breakoff of traditionalists from the Conservatives with a mildly `` libertarian '' faction , holds our public health insurance as an untouchable but that just a few people have to be reminded that it 's not free ( the average Canadian/European is more fiscally naive than their American counterparts on issues like these ) . But no mention of copayments anywhere to be seen ... but cutting public spending all over the place , and bringing back the death penalty , with little haste if elected . > I know that , for Pete 's sake , I live right on the border .

Yeah , but there 'd be a lot of lead-time and a health-care crisis that would preclude it . If provincial governments ( as bad as some of them are ; heck , we have the NDP cleaning up a spending mess made by the Conservatives in Saskatchewan - embarassing ! ) can be so irresponsible , there is still reallocation -- - health insurance is so important that it 's about the only thing that can inspire open rebellion and violent insurrection outside of the hockey rink .

Most Americans are fearful of a single-tier system ...

Shea , has cited studies in the NEJM that indicate having a population of 500,000 is necessary for adequate competition ... and in Canada , there are only four cities west of the Great Lakes with that population or larger . Anyways , the numbers show that costs have held steadier than those in the U.S. and barring any future Chernobyl-like crisis , sudden transients in spending are unlikely . In fact , the health allocation is one of the most well-behaved sectors of spending up north so any talk of bankruptcy is talk-radio fodder far away from the border . > If the provinces hit fiscal rough spots and have to cut back , the > things private insurers have to offer will seem less and less like > luxuries and the gap will be more and more noticeable . This wo n't be overnight , and something like this would force Canada to have a system more like the French one ... but that 's not a bad thing , and the change will be minimal ( i.e. , add copayments and frustrate the socialists chanting `` Hey , it 's *free* !

Is that how the mind of a compulsive liar works ? The scenario and genocide staged by the Armenians 78 years ago in x-Soviet Armenia is being reenacted again - this time in Azerbaijan . There are remarkable similarities between the plots , the perpetrators , and the underdogs . The stories of survivors of Karabag massacre : 69 year old Hatin Nine telling : - '' My Twin grandchildren were cut to pieces in front of my eyes . They told me : We wo n't kill you . But the babies have to die in front of your eyes . '' 72 year old Huseyin Ibrahimoglu : - `` Our Turkish village in Khojalu Town was blown up in two hours . While killing children and babies mercilessly they said : You are Turks , you must die . '' 28 year old Gulsum Huseyin : - `` They bayonetted my 3 year old daughter in her stomach in front of my eyes . '' Are these stories lies ? Have the eye-witnesses been day-dreaming ? Were these stories forged by Turkish journalists in the region ? The nonsense of such a claim is clear from the writings of British Journalists , too . Two days before we had quoted from a Sunday Times article . They [ British ] reported the events in Karabag even before Turkish journalists . What is more here are the pictures . Pictures of people who were bayonetted , whose eyes were gouged , ears cut off . Even the Armenian Radio could n't claim these `` lies . '' They are saying '' exaggeration . '' That means `` somethings '' have happened but the situation is not as bad as reported . Perhaps that village of Khojalu town was destroyed in 4 hours , instead of 2 ... Or Gulsum Huseyin's 3 year old daughter was bayonetted in her chest instead of stomach ... The massacre is clearly seen with all its dimensions . The effects of this massacre on Karabag and environs can not be reduced by any word . Some of the western press ' , led by some French Newspapers , ability to `` close their eyes '' is nothing but complicity in this massacre . Yesterday we gave samples from Le Figaro . Until yesterday 's print no news about the real events in Karabag were printed . So were the French TV channels.. The subject they considered related to Karabag was `` The necessity of protecting Armenians against Azeri attacks . '' The age we are living in is termed a human rights age . There are lots of organizations such as United Nations and CSCE ( Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe ) , and rules , all designed to fight against human rights violations . International reactions must be made with international cooperation . With support of everybody and every organization claiming to be civilized . Could there be a more serious human rights violation than that of the right to live -and with such levels of barbarity and cruelty- ? Where is the cooperation ? Where are the reactions ? And the intellectuals , journalists , writers , TV stations of certain western countries such as France who are fast to claim leadership of `` human rights ? '' Where are you ?

As `` Azerbaijan '' newspaper informs , the issue of attraction of western investments in Azerbaijan was discussed in the meeting . In particular , Gulyiev stated that western capital has to be investigated in the most profitable spheres of manufacture . He also noticed , that the number of the priority manufactures will be released from debts . Guliyev also said that intensifying the activities of the American oil companies will promote the strengthening of the American-Azeri relations . THE PROPOSAL TO SUMMON SPECIAL SESSION OF THE SUPREME SOVIET IS REJECTED AGAIN Baku ( May 19 ) Turan : Yesterday , in the sitting of the Milli Mejlis , the chairman , Isa Gambar , rejected the proposal of the deputy Arif Rahimzade to summon a special session of the Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan . This written proposal to summon a session was signed by 130 deputates . But the chairman said that the signatures were invalid and the proposal couldn't be submitted for discussion . Earlier , the leadership of the Milli Mejlis called the proposal to summon a special session of the Supreme Soviet a coup attempt . But the deputy for the Parliament , Rahimzade , does n't consider that the deputates have the objective of removing Milli Mejlis and its chairman from the power . It concerns the serious analysis of the social , economic and foreign policy activity of the republic 's authority . Rahimzade said that the deputates for the Parliament , ejected from their duties one year ago have the rights to express their opinion on these questions . The Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan ( 340 deputates ) was dissolved one year ago , when it attempted to bring Ayaz Mutalibov back to the power . The functions of S.S. were handed over to Milli Mejlis , consisting of 50 deputates ( 25 `` democrats '' and 25 `` partocrates '' ) . At that time `` democrats '' and '' partocrates '' came to an agreement that Milli Mejlis would n't exist for a long time and would be dissolved after parliamentary elections . At the same time , the deputates ejected from their duties were guaranteed that they could summon a session of the Supreme Soviet any time and went in for political activity out of the Parliament . -- 0 -- THE PROSPECTS OF TRADE/ECONOMIC COOPERATION BETWEEN AZERBAIJAN AND ESTONIA Baku ( May 19 ) Turan : The prospects of signing trade-economic agreement between Azerbaijan and Estonia were discussed in the meeting of the Foreign Minister Tofig Gasimov with the group of experts of the Ministry of Economics , Minister of Foreign Affairs and Estonian Bank administration on May 18 . The group of experts is headed by Tikht Reiman , the chief of the Ministry of Economics of Estonia . The MIA of Azerbaijan informed Turan agency , that in their stay in Baku , the delegation will also visit Ministry of Economics and National Bank of the republic. -- 0 -- AZERBAIJAN DOES NOT INTEND TO JOIN THE CIS COMMON ECONOMIC ZONE Baku ( May 19 ) Turan : Deputy prime-ministers of the republic , Vahid Ahmedov and Abbas Abbasov declared that Azerbaijan would n't join the CIS common economic zone . Vahid Ahmedov considers that the CIS economic zone proposal to create a common tax system contradicts independent economic policy of the republic . According to Abbas Abbasov , the pact of cooperation proposals , submitted for the discussion of the leaders of CIS states in Moscow on May 14 , has a number of unfavorable points for Azerbaijan . Such announcements of two deputy prime-ministers sound sensational on the background of the fact that the president of Azerbaijan and the chairman of the Parliament noted the necessity of the republic on joining the CIS economic zone. -- 0 -- THE QUESTIONS OF GRANTING CREDIT TO AZERBAIJAN WILL BE DISCUSSED IN MOSCOW Baku ( May 19 ) Turan : Today , Azerbaijani delegation headed by the director of the foreign relation department of the Ministry of Finance of the republic along with the representatives of the National Bank will leave for Moscow to hold consultation with Russian government on granting credit to Azerbaijan . According to the preliminary information , the credit will be 50 billion rubles . As press-centre of Ministry of Finance informed Turan 's correspondent , precise amount of the credit , conditions of its repay and a number of other questions of mutual interest will be discussed in the course of the meeting in Moscow . It is known that this credit will be mostly used for mutual settling of industrial enterprises of Azerbaijan and Russia . When the sides reach the agreement , it is proposed for signing by the end of May. -- 0 -- AZERBAIJAN WILL REPLY TO THE SECOND VARIANT OF TRILATERAL INITIATIVE BY 26 OF MAY Baku ( May 19 ) Turan : On the measures for peace presented by Russia , Turkey and the USA to Azerbaijan and Armenia , the representative of the president of Azerbaijan in the talks on Nagorno-Karabakh , Asim Gasimov noted that the plan was not seriously changed in comparison with the first variant . `` Just some comments to several points were added to the schedule by insistence of the Armenian side . We do not intend to come back to the analysis of the schedule , because we have given a positive answer to it on May 6 '' , - said Gasimov . The representative of the president of Azerbaijan informed that they just began to work on the examination of the commentary , and their answer would be given as requested by the authors of trilateral initiative by May 26 . As it is known , the first variant of the peace measures was rejected by Armenia , which put forward a number of pre-conditions for its acceptance. -- 0 -- THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE PROSECUTOR OF THE REPUBLIC OF AZERBAIJAN BAKU ( MAY 20 ) TURAN : The Azerbaijani prosecutor 's office has announced that the Russian mass media 's attempt to portray the 6 Russian soldiers condemned by the military board of the Azerbaijani Supreme Court , as innocent people is unjustified . Accounts of the witnesses and the confessions of the condemned themselves , prove that their crimes were committed together with the Armenian military units and with the knowledge of the headquarters of the Russian army unit , where they served . The announcement points out that the attempts to represent these soldiers as ordinary mercenaries who have nothing to do with the Russian army are also unfounded . For there are irrefutable evidences that these soldiers were on the list of one of the military unit 's of Russian commandos in Yerevan . Certain Russian circles try to conceal the fact of direct participation of the Russian army in the undeclared war of Armenia against Azerbaijan from the Russian community . Azerbaijan 's prosecutor 's announcement follows , that this type of actions can make the situation in the region much more complicated. -- 0 -- AZERBAIJAN 'S PARLIAMENT INTENDS TO APPEAL TO RUSSIAN PARLIAMENT REGARDING THE SIX ACCUSED SOLDIERS BAKU ( MAY 20 ) TURAN : As Turan agency was informed , parliament of Azerbaijan is considering the question of appealing to Russian parliament about the six accused soldiers ' fortune . In particular , the offer to send the representatives of the Commission on military affairs of the armed forces of Russian Federation to Baku for the detailed study of the results of six Russian soldiers ' case will be directed to Russian parliament . According to one of the supporters of this offer , such initiative will give Russian parliament the possibility to be convinced of the correctness of the investigation . There will also be a chance to discuss the reasons that have given rise to the present situation - that is the Russian troops participation in the war against Azerbaijan . ARMENIANS ARE PREPARING MORE `` KARABAKHS '' ON THE NORTH CAUCASUS BAKU ( MAY 20 ) TURAN : The National-liberation front founded by group of Armenians living on the North Caucasus appealed to establish Armenian autonomies on the territories of Rostov , Stavropol and Krasnodar regions , - reported the newspaper `` Russky vestnik '' on March 9 , 1993 published in Geneva . The North Caucasus is regarded as an integral part of Armenia in the documents of this organization . Admitting the non-realizability of `` reunion '' of the North Caucasus and `` Armenia proper '' at present , the front is appealing to the UN , presidents of Russia , Armenia and the United States to consider the need to establish Armenian autonomies on the Caucasus . To attain these goals , the Armenian organization considers it necessary to carry out on the North Caucasus the forms and methods of activity `` identical to those in Nagorno Karabakh '' . Besides the decision to fund cells of Armenian national-liberation fronts in every settlement and to appeal to leaders of Armenian terrorist groups in Greece and Iran to sent to the North Caucasus instructors for training of Armenian youth to wage secret wars was adopted . Thus according to the newspaper `` Russky vestnik '' , `` new Karabakhs '' are being planning on the North Caucasus . -- O -- STATE ASSISTANCE FOR NATIONAL MINORITY DEVELOPMENT BAKU ( MAY 20 ) TURAN : The meeting headed by the State secretary of Azerbaijan , Ali Kerimov , with the participation of the national cultural centers was held in Baku . The first results of the realization of the president Elchibey 's decree on state assistance for the development of language and culture of national minorities adopted on September 16 , 1992 were considered . The State secretary called this decree as an important step to establish a legal democratic state . He confirmed once more the commitment of the leadership of Azerbaijan to set up a democratic society in which the rights of all nationalities and ethnic groups would be respected . The State Counsellor of the president of Azerbaijan on the national policy , Hidayat Orujev , announced that in spite of the difficulties of the `` undeclared war '' against the republic , the leaders of the state managed to solve many problems concerning the satisfaction of cultural and other needs of the ethnic groups . For today , all 33 national-cultural centers registered by the Ministry of Justice in the capital of Azerbaijan are provided with accommodation , furniture and means of communication . All the accommodations are rent-free ( 8 foreign diplomatic missions in Baku are placed in the hotels because of the absence of free accommodations including the representation of the UN General secretary ) . As it was noted , a great work was carried out since the decree was adopted to create conditions for total development of the ethnic groups . On the North of Azerbaijan where Lezghins live , a national Lezghin theater was opened , radiocast is transmitted in Lezghin . The work over the creation of the educational literature for Talyshs , Tats , Lezghins and Kurds and national teaching and scientific staff is being carried out in the Academy of Sciences of Azerbaijan. -- O -- MEMORANDUM OF COOPERATION ON EXTRACTING OIL-GAS FIELDS OF AZERBAIJAN WAS SIGNED BAKU ( MAY 20 ) TURAN : As Turan agency was informed in the State concern `` Azerineft '' , the Memorandum of understanding with the companies '' AMOCO Caspian Sea Petroleum '' , `` Bi-Pi Exploration Operating '' , `` Pennzoil Caspian '' , `` Unocal Khazar Ltd. '' , `` McDermott '' and Turkish oil corporation on mutual extracting of fields `` Azeri '' , `` Chirag '' and `` Gyuneshli '' was signed . According to the memorandum , the general group on preparing of a common program of activity was created . According to the president of `` Azerineft '' , Sabit Bagirov , cooperation will provide for using the experience of foreign companies more efficiently . During the project , the main principles will be the effective use of oil-gas resources , the rational sharing of investments , the reducing of exploitation expenditures and maximizing the profit of Azerbaijan from the exploitation of these fields . The memorandum also envisions the necessity to take into account the historical and political-economical interests of Azerbaijan under optimum use of oil-gas fields . -- O -- ARMENIA TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE PROSECUTION OF SIX RUSSIAN SOLDIERS BAKU ( MAY 21 ) TURAN : After Azerbaijani court passed sentence on six Russian soldiers fighting on the Armenian side in Karabakh , Armenian propaganda has become actively involved . The Armenians living in Russia appealed to the president Yeltsin with a request `` to display firmness in asserting the rights of Russian soldiers '' . At the same time , Armenian mass media call legal proceedings on the case in Baku as `` a farce aimed at getting more arms from Russia '' . The Karabakh Armenians have issued a threat recently . If one could believe the Yerevan agency `` Snark '' , the Armenians in Karabakh presented an ultimatum to authorities in Azerbaijan . The essence of this ultimatum is that if Russian soldiers are not shown mercy , three Azeri prisoners in Karabakh will be shot dead . It is simple to explain such `` touching attitude of Armenians '' to the six Russian soldiers ' fate . If by chance the sentence is executed it will cause not anti-Azeri but anti-Armenian reaction , as the accused Russian soldiers were recruited in Yerevan by the former Defence Minister of Armenia and then transferred to Karabakh . If the soldiers get mercy , Armenian side will think highly of its saving of lives of `` innocent Russians '' . -- O -- NEW PROVOCATIONS OF ARMED FORCES OF ARMENIA BAKU ( MAY 21 ) TURAN : According to the Defence Ministry of Azerbaijan on May 20-21 , the firing on the territories of Azerbaijan from the military bases on the territory of Armenia was in progress . The day before , the villages of Kolly-Gyshlag , Shotaraz , Nyachaflar of Zangelan district of Azerbaijan were under fire from Kafan district of Armenia . Two inhabitants were wounded , there were destructions in the villages . On May 20 , the firing on the villages of Bashkend , Mutudere , Shynykh , Novosaratovka and Novoivanovka of Kedabek district of Azerbaijan from the positions of Armenian armed forces was in progress . At the same day the diversion group of the armed forces of Armenia ( 50-60 men ) violated the frontier of Azerbaijan , penetrated into the territory of Kedabek district of Azerbaijan , killed two shepherds at the village of Aili-Dara and made an attempt to take a flock across the frontier . Azeri frontier-guards stopped the enemy. -- O -- '' UNOCAL '' COMPANY WILL BUILD 50 HOUSES FOR REFUGEES IN AZERBAIJAN BAKU ( MAY 21 ) TURAN : As Turan agency was informed by the representation of UNOCAL American oil company , the leaders of this company decided to give 750 thousand dollars for the construction of 50 houses for refugees . At present , the American side suggested a village project for consideration by appropriate departments of Azerbaijan . The project is a farm village where each house has a personal lot , subsidiary accommodations and so on . According to the program the construction and putting into operation of the village will be this year . -- O -- MANAT IS BEGINNING TO FALL IN VALUE BAKU ( MAY 21 ) TURAN : Lately , at the black market of Baku , the national currency - Manat , fell in price compared with the Russian Ruble . Thus one gives 1100 Rubles or 120 Manats for one US dollar . Taking into account the official exchange-value of the Manat with respect to Ruble which is 1-10 , the national currency fell in value 10 percent . Meanwhile the exchange-value of the Manat to the Ruble is the same at banks , state establishments and in trade . According to the representatives of the business circles and experts , the present situation is explained by the fact that the rubles are bought by the local businessmen . They need rubles for financial operations in Russia . As the remittance of payments from the republics of the former USSR to Russia is a great problem now , many businessmen arrange deals in cash . Taking into consideration the volume of business with Russia , counted by billions , it is not hard to imagine how much Rubles in cash the businessmen need . -- O -- THE DISCUSSION OF PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION BILL WILL LAST TILL MID JULY Baku ( May 22 ) Turan : According to the president 's decree , the expert group , including representatives of the Parliament and presidential apparatus , are working out new wording of the Constitution of the Republic of Azerbaijan . This must be adopted by Milli Mejlis before the Parliamentary elections . Together with this , the work on the new Constitution , that would be , evidently , adopted by new Parliament of the country , is going on . The newsmen were informed about the work on the press-conference of the Supreme Soviet of the republic the day before . Parliamentary legal experts , Safa Mirzoyev , Simran Hasanov and representatives of the department of the president 's apparatus Fazil Mustafaev and Shahin Aliev took part in the press-conference . The national discussion of the project of the Parliamentary election law is going on at present . According to Simran Hasanov the bill did n't cause any objections . It was noted , that until now , no alternative variant of the election law was put forward . The newsmen were also informed , that Parliamentary commissions will examine all coming proposals till June 10 . By June 15 all proposals will be generalized and submitted for discussion in Milli Mejlis. -- 0 -- ISA GAMBAR SUGGESTS THAT AZERI-RUSSIAN PARLIAMENT COMMISSION FOR CLARIFYING THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CRIMINAL CASE BE CREATED BAKU ( MAY 22 ) TURAN : The Chairman of the Milly Mejlis of the Azerbaijan republic , Isa Gambar , sent the return letter to the Chairman of the Russian Supreme Soviet Ruslan Khasbulatov in connection with the conviction of the Russian servicemen lieutenant V.Semion , sergeant K. Tukish , M.Lisov and A.Filipov by the military college of the Supreme Court of Azerbaijan . In his letter , Isa Gambar suggested that the commission of Azerbaijan Milly Mejlis deputates on a par with the experts of the Russian Supreme Soviet be established to clarify the circumstances of this criminal case . In his view , `` the conclusion of the commission could help in the objective solving of this problem , as well as such kind of problems in the future . But the main thing is , it could help to promote the knowledge about involvement of the Russian servicemen in crime '' . In its turn , in connection with the Russian parliament message , Milly Mejlis adopted a resolution on May 19 , according to which the permanent commissions on government building and legal policy , human rights and international relations are charged with the exploration of this problem. -- 0 -- WILL THE TRILATERAL INITIATIVE BE RUINED ? Baku ( May 22 ) Turan : As Turan agency was informed , Russian representative to the talks on Karabakh , Vladimir Kazimirov , doubted in realization of the Trilateral initiative . He expressed this opinion during a telephone talk with the representatives of Azerbaijan . At the same talk he declared , that in case the peace process deadlocked , Russia would pursue Yeltsin 's initiative itself . Such statement from the Russian diplomat , who is one of the authors of the Trilateral initiative , suggests that the Russian leadership is paving the way for complete exclusion of the USA and probably Turkey from the peacemaking process . This statement can also mean , that Russia and US having achieved understanding on Bosnian problem , have agreed on partial US departure from Transcaucasia. -- 0 -- FATE OF 645 MILLION TONS OF OIL WILL BE DECIDED THIS SUMMER Baku ( May 22 ) Turan : The president of Azerbaijan State Oil Company , Sabit Bagirov , declared recently that complete treaty on development of oil fields Chirag , Azeri and Guneshli would be signed this summer . As it is known , western oil companies AMOCO , BP-STATOIL , PENNZOIL- RAMCO have an interest on development of these three richest Caspian fields . According to the plan , SOCAR and BP-STATOIL are to sign a complete treaty on development of Chirag field on June 16 . Later AMOCO and PENNZOIL will sign treaties . Specialists value total reserves of these three fields to be 645 million ton . 310 million of them fall on Azeri field , 180 mln.ton on Geneshli and 150 mln.ton on Chirag . The exploitation of these fields is to last tens of years and it is to bring in Azerbaijan 100 billion dollars in revenue . In addition to the net economic profit , Baku calculates upon the political support of the West in the defence of its interests at the international scene . As president Elchibey said in his closest encirclement `` the May of 1993 will be one of the most difficult periods for Azerbaijan and its independence and we have to stand these tests '' . -- 0 -- THE SCIENTIST-LAWYERS OF RUSSIA APPEALED TO THE PRESIDENT OF AZERBAIJAN BAKU ( MAY 22 ) TURAN : As the press-service of the president of Azerbaijan informs , today , the appeal of the Institute of the Government and law of the Russian Academy of Sciences to president Elchibey was received . The appeal contains the call `` to display mercy , humanism and clemency on the death sentences of the former servicemen of the Russian Armed Forces '' . The authors of the appeal point out , that they do n't justify the participation of the Russian servicemen in the war against the azeri people , do n't call in question the lawfulness of the passed sentence , denounce the mercenary according to the UN principals , and they are sorry about the Russian servicemen being drawn in such grave crime . At the end of their letter , scientists , mentioning the soldiers' mothers ' tears and grief , their praying day and night of safety , ask the president of Azerbaijan to `` save those guys '' . It should be noticed , that unlike lawyers , soldiers ' mothers , taking part in the inquiry , called the cause of their grief only Russian policy . According to their words , the leaders , that lay down lives of Russian men to achieve their political aims , must be made answerable . Unfortunately , the appeal did n't mention the grief of the mothers of Azerbaijani soldiers , killed by sentenced Russian servicemen. -- 0 -- ARMENIAN ARTILLERY CONTINUES FIRING ON AZERI DISTRICTS BAKU ( MAY 22 ) TURAN : On May 22 , two soldiers of National army of Azerbaijan were killed during the `` Grad '' shelling of the villages of Kolly Gyshlag , Shaifly , Shotaraz , Nyachaflar of Zangelan district of the republic from the territory of Kafan district of Armenia . The night before and in the morning of May 22 , the villages of Tovuz , Gazakh and Gubatly districts of Azerbaijan were under fire from the territory of Armenia . There are destructions . The situation in Agder district of Azerbaijan became complicated . On May 21 , the enemy fired on the regional centre of Agdere from the village of Ortakend . The transportation of man power and military equipment to this district is in progress . According to reports the enemy is setting up a new weapon emplacement to fire on the regional centre and near by villages . According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs , the concentration of man power and military equipment is observed in Krasnoselsky district of Armenia which borders on Azerbaijan as well as on the frontier with Fizuli district . -- O -- AZERI PRIME-MINISTER IS LEAVING FOR GREAT BRITAIN BAKU ( MAY 22 ) TURAN : The Minister of Foreign Economic Relations , Rauf Garayev , in his interview to Turan agency said , that '' Great Britain is the biggest foreign economic partner of Azerbaijan after Iran '' . The business cooperation between the two countries develops in such spheres as oil - industry , the manufacture of oil extraction equipment , communication and agriculture . According to the Minister 's words , the forthcoming visit of Azerbaijani Prime-Minister , Panah Huseynov , to Great Britain on May 23-24 , is very important . It is expected , that the visit will help , to solve the problems of opening in Azerbaijan the branch offices of some British banks , insurance firms ; to conclude contracts on the sphere of manufacture of agricultural equipment ; on building in Azerbaijan off shore oil platforms , and reconstruction of the entire communication system of Azerbaijan . In Garayev 's view , the expansion of the cooperation with Great Britain will have a great political meaning for Azerbaijan . According to politicians and reviewers in Baku , at present , Great Britain as an European state is close to Azerbaijan . The continuation of the economic and political cooperation of the two states is foreseen . -- O -- \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ T U R A N N E W S A G E N C Y Baku - Azerbaijan Phone : ( 8922 ) 66-7977 66-7833 Fax : ( 8922 ) 66-2009 Telex : 142168 META SU \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ Serdar Argic 'We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the Turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination .

Excerpt . EACH ONE AND HIS OWN NEVO* ( * A reference to General Azri'el Nevo , Shamir 's Military Secretary . Irrelevant to this excerpt . ) By Nahum Barne ' a . . . In mid '91 SHABAK found itself in the center of another storm [ ... ] . A year and a half earlier , Khaled Sheikh Ali , 27 , a member of the Islamic Jihad , died at the SHABAK installation in Gaza prison . The two SHABAK interrogators who were responsible for his death were put on trial . In September '91 the Supreme Court rejected their appeal and sentenced them to 6 months in prison . As far as is known , this was the first time in Israel 's history that SHABAK operatives were sent to prison . The Supreme Court unanimously rejected the warning by the director of SHABAK that the sentence will be detrimental the effectiveness of other interrogators . [ ... ] The judges in the case were [ ... ] Barak , Goldberg , and Matza . When they realized that they were on their own , the interrogators agreed to talk . Deputy State Attorney Rachel Sukkar [ sp ? ] was placed in charge of investigating the affair . She [ ... ] questioned the directors of all SHABAK divisions . She investigated only the matter of the death in Gaza prison . She discovered that not only torture , but also `` the culture of lies '' , which Judge Landau had described in his report of two years before , were still very much in existence . Nothing had changed . The report was classified and was seen by only some ten people , among them the Prime Minister , the people at the top of the judicial system and Judge Landau . The director of SHABAK claimed that he did not know . After all , they were dealing only with a single jail and with low ranking people . The system bit the bullet and accepted the explanation . One of SHABAK 's high-ranking officials was transfered from his very high position to a less high position . . . . [ `` The culture of lies '' referred to above is the SHABAK interrogators' policy of lying in court when denying detainees claims that they were tortured in the course of interrogation . The Landau commission sought to correct this problem by legalizing a list of torture methods -- thus eliminating the fear that a detainee might be released if those methods were used to extract a confession . The fact that the need to lie still persists would seem to indicate that SHABAK is not sticking to the `` approved '' torture methods . -- Yigal ] -- Yigal Arens USC/ISI TV made me do it ! arens @ isi.edu

Shall we start a new thread called , > say , `` Infallibility in Islam '' and move the discussion there ? I think this should be illuminating to all . Let me make a first suggestion . When Arabic words , especially technical ones , become of use let us define them for those , especially atheists , to whom they may not be terribly familiar . Please also note that though I did initially refer to Khomeini as a heretic for what I understood to be a claim -- rejected by you since -- of personal infallibility , I withdraw this as a basis for such a statement . I conditionally retain this reference in regard to Khomeini 's advocacy of the thesis of the infallibility of the so-called `` Twelve Imams , '' which is in clear conflict with the Qur'an in that it places the Twelve Imams in a category of behavior and example higher than that of the Muhammad , in that the Qur'an shows that the Prophet was clearly fallible , as well as ( it appears , given your abstruse theological statment regarding the `` natures '' of the Twelve Imams ) placing them in a different metaphysical category than the remainder of humanity , with the possible exception of Muhammad , something which verges on the sin of association . > As salam a-laikum Alaikum Wassalam , Gregg

The apocryphal books demonstrate the same categories and forms of writing found in the other scriptures .

Have you ever read the Wisdom of Ben Sira or the Wisdom of Solomon ? They exhibit every bit as much `` poetic and religious feeling '' as Psalms or Proverbs .

These words clearly were meant to refer to the book of Revelation alone , not to the whole body of scripture . Revelation itself was accepted very late into the canon . The church simply did not see it as having a primary role of any kind in identifying and limiting scripture . : It is also noteworthy to consider Jesus ' attitude . He had no : argument with the pharisees over any of the OT canon ( John : 10.31-6 ) , and explained to his followers on the road to Emmaus : that in the law , prophets and psalms which referred to him - the : OT division of Scripture ( Luke 24.44 ) , as well as in Luke 11.51 : taking Genesis to Chronicles ( the jewish order - we would say : Genesis to Malachi ) as Scripture . Jesus does not refer to the canon for the simple reason that in his day , the canon had not been established as a closed collection . The books of the apocrypha were part of the Septuagint ( which was the Bible of the early church ) . The Hebrew canon was not closed until 90 c.e . The Torah ( Pentateuch/ `` Law '' ) was established in Jesus ' day , as were the Prophets ( with the _exclusion_ of Daniel ) . The Writings , however , were still in flux . Jesus does not refer to the Writings , only to the Psalms , which were part of them . The books of the apocrypha were all part of the literature that was eventually sifted and separated . To argue that Jesus is referring to the Jewish canonical order in Luke 11:51 is weak at best ; he is not quoting scripture , but telling a chronological story . And , as mentioned above , the Hebrew canon ( especially in the present order ) did not exist as such in Jesus ' day . revdak @ netcom.com

If you want to protect you soft , supply a > good documentation and support . This is IMHO the *only* way of effectively > protecting software . There are several types of copy protection , and the point is to make sure the user is using a legitimate copy . The simplest and virtually fool-proof way is for the program to somehow fixate itself to the machine it was installed on ( some sort of checksum , serial number , whatever ) so a copy put on a different machine ( NOT installed from original disks ) will not work . The program is definitely backupable , if restored to the same machine ( depends on the programmer ... do n't use a disk drive characteristic ! ) If the user did an upgrade to the machine , he/she should reinstall all programs any way . No document look-up , no disk wear-and-tear ! I did not say that the originals would allow only one install . The user 's conscience should do that . I know , I 'll get flamed for this ... But with the increasing number of `` casual '' users who either unknowingly or do n't care about the software copyrights ( It 's the truth . I have `` friends '' who ask me for copies of my latest games all the time , and when I refused , they went after somebody else . ) , casual pirating is becoming more of a problem . Some sort of copy protection will discourage the casual copying . I 've seen what some of my `` friends '' dug up somewhere ... Latest and the greatest games , all cracked , WITHIN days of actual release ! You know how many bytes you need to change in X-wing to disable the quiz ? TWO ! Yes , TWO ! ( And do n't ask me which ones they are . ) Determined pirates are unstoppable , given enough time , but their results do not spread that far , since pirate boards are not that well-known , and easily tracked once found by authorities . It is the `` casual '' pirates that the copy protection is determined to discourage . What I believe the companies should do is implement the above plus a special patch once the user registers that loudly exclaims upon bootup '' REGISTERED TO XXXXX -- address , city , state zip '' and disables the above . Two benefits : 1 ) encourages registration , 2 ) cuts down on pirating and makes it more traceable , because if the patch 's registration message is encrypted , it will be quite hard to change , and therefore provides a stable trail of who allowed their copy out of their hands , and thus violated their license agreement . This way , the legitimate users who does not register will experience minimal discomfort ( who does major upgrades to their computer frequently ? ) as only problem they have is they wo n't be able to restore to another computer . The registered users would have proven they are legitmate users and therefore gains full rights , and can restore to different machines . On the other hand , the software company now have a record of where THIS particular copy is supposed to be . If this user 's copy was found to be somewhere it was not supposed to be , we know who has broken their license agreement . Of course , a hacker can break that eventually , but that 's not the point , is it ? -- Kasey Chang

That includes suicides . Since it has been shown in other countries that suicide rates are pretty much independent of the means available for doing oneself in ( studies include some done/published in Japan , Canada , Austria , Norway ) , suicides ought not be included in the count .

From : artmel @ well.sf.ca.us ( Arthur Melnick ) Subject : New Encryption Algorithm Summary : The history of NEA Keywords : NEA Nntp-Posting-Host : well.sf.ca.us Organization : The Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link , Sausalito , CA Lines : 76 Ever since Craig Rowland posted his piece `` New Encryption '' to sci.crypt there has been some discussion of our company , Secured Communications Technologies , Inc , and on encryption algorithm , NEA . I spoke to Craig at length on 4/21/93 and we covered a lot of ground . Some of the information in the posting requires some clarification , and I would like to answer some of the questions raised on sci.crypt . SCT is a small company based in Silver Spring Maryland . Our two main products at this time are a PC based secure communications program called SECOM and a general purpose encryption chip which uses the NEA algorithm developed for SECOM . SECOM provides an encrypted secure communication link between two PC 's connected over dial up telephone lines . It supports simultaneous bi-directional file transfer and keyboard to screen `` chat '' . It has its own proprietary communications protocol which is tightly integrated to the encryption . All though it is a packetized link , the data stream appears to be continuous because the packet boundaries are hidden . When SECOM was initially developed , it was implemented to use DES encryption . A business decision was made to seek export approval for the product because it was perceived that the overseas market was a large one and provided a good marketing opportunity . We soon found out that we would NEVER be granted general export approval for anything using DES . All though the reason for this was never explicitly stated , it seems to have something to do with secret government to government agreements which are still in effect . In any event , the decision was made to develop a new and different algorithm which would take the place of DES . This was the reason NEA ( New Encryption Algorithm ) was born . At this time NEA is being held as a trade secret . The preliminary work of patenting it has begun , and the plan is to make it public once the patent process is complete . All though one can make certain legal arguments for keeping it an ongoing secret , I think in the case of an encryption algorithm it is necessary to let people `` shoot at it '' over an extended period of time to prove its worth . In order to get export approval for SECOM/NEA , it was necessary to go through NSA and to reveal to them the details of the program and algorithm . This was done only AFTER we had a finished product to submit . Let me state unequivocally that there is NO `` back door '' to the program or the algorithm . Secured Communications Technologies is a closely held private company and NSA/FBI/CIA/NIST/WHATEVER has NO financial interest in any way whatsoever with the company or any of the people involved . From a practical business standpoint , we are interested in selling chips and software ( hopefully in large quantities ) and a back door to the encryption , if found out , could destroy our credibility and our business . With the encryption algorithm approved for export , we set out to talk to a number of potential customers for encryption products and systems . We were able to identify several common threads of functionality requirements . This led to the design of a chip with the encryption algorithm `` cast in silicon '' and certain other capabilities added so that the chip could fulfill the broad range of requirements that we identified . We are strongly opposed to the clipper/capstone chips . In a press release today , our president , Dr. Stephen Bryen stated : `` It seems as if the government has an unlimited source of funds to use to push its new bugged chips on the American Public . But do we not understand how the National Security Agency , which is not supposed to be involved in domestic spying , can fund the development of a commercial chip intended to accommodate U.S. government domestic spying activities . '' If they had asked me to put a `` back door '' in NEA I would have told them to g__ f____ed . Can NSA break NEA ? Or for that matter can they break DES , RSA , IDEA , Diffy-Hellman , PGP , RC2 , RC4 , or whatever ? I don't know and probably never will .

From : ken @ wybbs.mi.org Subject : *** CONSUMER WARNING *** MidWest Micro ( Ohio ) Organization : Consultant 's Connection Distribution : na Lines : 54 Thinking of buying from MidWest Micro of Ohio ? Think *very* carefully . Unless you are absolutely sure you wo n't have any problems , you may want to trade elsewhere . Despite the fact that they answer the phone , `` Hi ! I 'm < whoever > and we're having a GREAT Day ! `` , they were n't quite so happy when I wanted to return a modem that did n't work as I expected it to . The details : I ordered one of their house brand `` Infotel '' 14.4/DF internal FAX modems . In reality , it was a Twincom Lightning FAX that had a paper sticker over the name . Given the poor reports on the net about this modem , I would not have ordered it , had I known this in advance . It arrived on time . The documentation stated that it would work ( and was preconfigured ) as COM4 , providing that COM2 was not in use at the same time . For several reasons , I have a serial card configured for COM1/COM2 . At the time I installed the modem , nothing was connected to COM2 . Although the modem appeared to work , during every connection at 9600 or 14.4 , it would randomly break the connection and hang up the phone . After spending some time on the phone with MidWest 's tech support , they suggested disabling the COM2 port . This appeared to solve the disconnect problem , but was an unacceptable long term solution . I had to have COM1 and 2 available , even though they both would not be in use at the same time as the modem . I called back 20 minutes prior to their closing and waited in Voicemail hell , listening to repeated advertisements for MidWest Micro products . I was then promptly disconnected . Apparently it was quiting time and they did n't want to be bothered with callers that had been waiting on the line . I called the next day and asked the Customer Diservice agent for an RMA number . She promptly switched me to a `` Tech Support '' rep that implied that it was my equipment at fault and that he was n't going to give me an RMA number . He suggested I use some nonstandard IRQ settings , a solution I was not happy with . The modem should work as originally configured . Conclusion : I 'm not sure the modem would work ok in a basic system , but it clearly does not work in a multi port system like mine . Since my time is worth more than the aggravation or the cost of the modem , I gave it to a local charitable organization ( with a description of my problem ) and ordered a Practical Peripherals 14.4MT from PC Connection . For $ 30 more , I have a solid external modem built by a company I know will support their users and sold by a company ( based on personal experience ) will treat me right if there is a problem . I should have known better ...

The last year before Bryan Murray took over , the Wings did not make the playoffs . While they had been considered a possible contender when Jacques Demers first arrived , in his last two years they were , respectively , embarrassed in the first round by Chicago , and then failed to make the playoffs ( at a time , a might add , when there were only five teams in the Norris ) . It 's true that Vancouver did not make the playoffs for many a year before Quinn came , but in those years the Smythe Division was a lot -- I mean *a lot* -- tougher division than the Norris , also known as the `` Snorris '' , division . Vancouver had to play Edmonton and Calgary , both very legitimate Stanley Cup contenders , eight times a year , while Detroit got to play such powerhouses as Toronto and Minnesota . Now , Edmonton is hardly even a force in the league , and the Smythe even has the mighty San Jose sharks , while over this same period of time in which Vancouver was improving , so was everybody in the Norris ( except St. Louis ) . Detroit had to improve just to keep up with the competition in their division . They had to improve *a lot* to get better than their competition in the Norris . Bryan Murray inherited a team with very little talent . For really good players , they had Yzerman , Burr , and Probert , and that was about it . ( And no doubt some will dispute whether Burr and Probert were that good ) . The rest were either very green rookies or washed up veterans . The only reason they got as far as they did in the years before Murray came was due to the coaching of Demers , who , at least at first , got every last ounce of effort possible out of his team . Then , even his coaching began to degrade . > So Quinn has improved his team more than Murray has since taking over as a GM . > Quinn is one example of a better GM than Murray . There are a number of reasons why Detroit was n't in as bad a shape standings wise when Murray took over as Vanc . was when Quinn took over , some of which I outlined above , but Murray did not have any better personnel to work with at the outset than did Quinn , with the exception of Yzerman . And one player can not alone make a team into a Stanley Cup contender , as I 'm sure everyone reading this will agree . We 'll be able to see better which team is really the most improved when they face each other in the conference final ( assuming they do n't get knocked out , like last year ) . > Gregmeister -- Randy

Organization : Express Access Online Communications , Greenbelt , MD USA Lines : 36 NNTP-Posting-Host : access.digex.net Summary : Why the repeated leaks ? Keywords : clutch master cyl problems I have both an '84 and an '86 Camry , each with manual 5-speed transmissions . The '84 has about 105,000 miles on it and the '86 about 83,000 miles . ABout a year ago I found that the master cylinder on the clutch in the '84 was leaking fluid around the piston seal , leading to air in the system and fluid back into the passenger compartment of the car . I pulled the plunger and got a rebuild kit ( new plunger , seal , etc . ) and thought I had the problem licked . Much to my surprise , the same problem developed several months later ! This time I looked carefully at the master cylinder to make sure there were no scratches , burrs , or other obvious causes of the problem . I did n't find any . Ever since I have been periodically feeding the clutch hydraulins additional fluid and bleeding air from the system . I knew I would be selling the car and did n't want to go all the way to solving the problem . I should add that the clutch is original , and that I 've had to adjust the pedal to allow maximum extension of the piston into the master cylinder in order to actuate the clutch . My hypothesis is that this means that when fully depressing the clutch pedal , the angle of the piston rod ( attached to the pedal ) is off the axix of the cylinder , thus cocking the piston and seal and perhaps deforming it . What do you think of that as an explanation ? Can you suggest a possible fix short of replacing the master cylinder and getting a new clutch put in ? Now the '86 : same problem , except that the above diagnosis does n't explain why all of the fluid leaked out ( by way of the master cylinder , into the passenger compartment ) while I was on vacation for 10 days , during which the clutch pedal was not depressed or otherwise caused to distort . What can you suggest here ? Many thanks . Let 's hope I do n't end up going to Click and Clack on this ... Bill Christens-Barry cerulean @ access.digex.com

From : eliot @ engr.washington.edu ( eliot ) Subject : REVIEW : Audi S4 quattro Organization : skulls ' r us Lines : 175 Distribution : world Reply-To : eliot @ engr.washington.edu ( eliot ) NNTP-Posting-Host : lanmola.engr.washington.edu It 's been a while since I 've reviewed a car but today I paid a visit to an old friend whose love for Audis has been so overwhelming that he makes a not too sucessful living selling them . Without further delay , I will get to the 1993 Audi S4 : 1 ) Servotronic steering : [ For those who are not familiar with what Servotronic is , it is the name for the speed variable power steering manufactured by ZF and used in Audis and BMWs . ] I have been outspoken in my damming of Servotronic over the past couple of months , and this was based on magazine reviews and drives of the Audi 90 CS quattro and the Audi 100CS fwd . I am quite happy to report now that on the S4 , the Servotronic is *inoffensive* . I suppose that due to the fat gumball tires , the Servotronic has been loaded up more and this , so far has been the best implementation that I have tried . It is far from perfect , mind you , and I 'd be much happier if it was an option that I could refuse , but on the S4 , I no longer consider this to be bad enough where I feel the entire car is ruined . The steering is still a tad too light , but it is accurate and I suppose the stiffly sprung chassis sends back so much information that some makes it through to the driver 's hands . So there is feel and there is accuracy in the S4 's steering . But there is also room for improvement . I consider the S4 's steering to be better than the Japanese competition , primarily because the Japanese do not believe in '' feel '' and engineer it out completely . 2 ) Engine Wheee ! What a pressure cooker . With just 110 miles on the clock I did not expect the S4 to be producing anywhere close to what it will be putting out 10000 miles later , but still , the car packs a terrific punch . For a turbocharged machine , it is very unusual in that it encourages lazy driving . i.e . low revs , high gear . It is so supremely flexible that one could hardly believe that there 's only 2.2 liters of displacement to move this 3700 pound car around in such a fashion . With maximum torque available at 1950 rpm and a 7200 rpm redline , the car can pretty much be left in third all day.. which translates to a speed range of something like 20-100 mph . A chracteristic that one normally associates with large capacity V8s . The technical achievement is breadthtaking . Throttle response is right up there with a good atmospheric engine . In fact , it would even put peaky multivalve engines to shame . Downshifts are almost unnecessary . It is more fun to use the `` overboost '' feature than to rev the engine . For those not familiar , the S4 engine features up to 15 seconds of additional turbo boost for passing . Sort of like lighting up the after burners in a jet fighter , one could , with the right foot only , in third gear , blast the car from 30 to 80 in just a few moments.. simply by flooring the gas . As far as the numbers go , maximum torque available in overboost mode shoots up to about 270 lb ft.. incredible for a 2.2 liter . It takes a few moments for it to develop overboost but it is well worth waiting for . Since this is quite a heavy car , one 's body parts are not flung around like say , the Corrado VR6 . The acceleration is smooth and strong , somewhat similar to riding in a jetliner as it accelerates down the runway on takeoff . Also , one is treated to a very distinctive and entertaining whistle from the turbo.. the only entertaining sound to come out of a very refined but bland sounding 5 banger.. Yes , Audi has refined the 5 to the point where at 7200 rpm it sounds as serene as it does at 2000 . The smoothness is outstanding , but not quite up to the standards of a very good 6 , e.g . a 12 valve BMW . I 'd say that in terms of refinement , i.e . willingness to rev , smoothness , lack of harshness under full acceleration it is better than many V6s . However , lost in the refinement process is the characteristic 5 cylinder bark that made the older engines so characterful , if not terribly refined . The 20 valve turbo 5 sounds pretty bland except for the whistle under full boost . Subjectively , I 'd rate the VW VR6 engine as being far more musical than the turbo 5.. Also , Audi 's own V8 is also far more musical , with a rorty race car growl when pressed , though none of these can match its grunt . The only hint of the engine 's true capacity occurs when one is taking off from rest after the turbo has come to a near stop . With the extra inertia from the permanently engaged 4wd system , one has to be somewhat delicate in feeding in the clutch to prevent an embarassing stall . Alternately one could use more revs.. In both cases a very small price to pay for such a fantastic engine . I think that Audi of America should offer an automatic option for this car , just as they offer ( though in extremely small numbers ) a 5 speed for the much peakier V8 . The characteristics of the engine are perfect for an automatic . Ironically , in europe a slush is available but none is offered for the land of the slush . Marketing twits rearing their ugly heads again ... 3 ) Chassis I 've noticed that Audis tend to have very wide wheels and relatively modest tire widths . The car comes with Firestones of size 225/50 ZR16.. which is not uncommon at all . However , the very attractive 5 spoke wheels are no less than 8 inches wide , so there is no sidewall bulge whatsoever . Combined with the flared wheel arches , the S4 has a mouth watering macho , yet subdued look . On rough concrete , it becomes immediately clear that the new 100 body style has made significant advances in structural rigidity as well as road noise suppression.. I suppose the two are inter-related , but I digress . To use a cliche , the S4 's body feels like it has been carved out of stone . Flex is totally undetectable , even when going over rough roads . With a super rigid body like this stiff springs and stiff dampers do not cause excessive harshness and while the S4 's ride quality will never worry a Lexus , it will also not draw comparisons to trucks or pony cars . The servotronic steering has already been mentioned . I consider it to be inoffensive because it did not inhibit spirited cornering . I was able to test the car 's cornering powers without too much trepidation . I think a new concept is at work in this car . With its fat gumball tires , talking about understeer or oversteer is practically meaningless . On a banked highway on ramp , I went in slow and started applying power as I went around . I could feel the g forces build to the point where the skin on my face was being tugged sideways . Yet the car was totally and completely obedient to throttle and steering inputs.. It felt that the limits were not even close to being approached . The g forces were thrilling , but the entire affair of going around a curve is strangely uninvolving . You tell the car what you want and it does it . End of story . I think that I am starting to relate more and more to those reviewers who were highly impressed by the Honda NSX 's clinical efficiency but were unable to fall in love with the car . The brakes have a very good firmness to them and stop the car pretty well too , though I 've read that they are prone to fade . I am not too surprised , since the S4 does not have uprated brakes over the base Audi 100 fwd . Harder pads would help , but that in turn would lead to a more wooden response when cold . I am starting to see a trend among the luxury/sports sedan makers where extra weight is not being offset by additional braking capacity . The LS400 's fade performance is nothing to brag about ; neither is the Q45 's or the Legend 's . Brake fade these days seem to be a forgotten virtue when everybody 's attention is focused on anti-lock capability . 4 ) Comfort For a car with such sporty abilities , its comfort levels are also excellent . The cabin is beautifully appointed , with carbon-fiber panel inserts in place of the wood trim of the '92 S4 . All the expected gizmos are there.. heated seats , power seats , seat memory , power this and that . The glaring ommision was the trip computer , which was removed because Audi has n't gotten it to work reliably yet.. That means that the car has no boost gauge . A real disappointment taking into account how much the turbo dominates its performance . Unusual for the germans , the S4 comes with a Honda style moonroof , as well as the very intelligent dial-a-sunroof-position rotary switch . Noise levels , including engine and tire noise is so low that I wouldn't consider the Lexus ' advantage in this area to be significant enough to sway a potential buyer . 5 ) Conclusion Even though few will be able to afford an Audi S4 at its sticker price of $ 48K , the car is a bargain if one takes into account what it has to offer over the competition . The 20 valve turbo 5 is a real gem , even if it does n't produce Ferrari sounds . No other luxury/sports sedan maker offers the utter security of quattro all wheel drive , which to some is worth the extra money all by itself . The safety features are also top notch.. 1994 side impact standard compliant , the very elegant automatic seat belt tensioners and the dual airbags . The 100 series Audis have been outstanding in government crash tests . It gets my thumbs up for being so overwhelmingly capable rather than being all out exciting and intoxicating . eliot

Indeed , the sky does n't look much like a black body if you look carefully enough ; in particular , its temperature at radio frequencies is quite a bit higher than you would see from a black body . Morgan & Gordon 's fat '' Communications Satellite Handbook '' has a graph of sky temperature vs. wavelength , in fact , for communications design . However , in terms of energy content , the RF frequencies are negligible . For thermal purposes , at very large distances from the Sun the sky looks like a black body at 3.5K ( Allen , `` Astrophysical Quantities '' ) . I have n't found a number for non-large distances , since solar radiation tends to be something you ca n't just ignore : - ) , but M & G says `` about 4K '' in a brief discussion of why solar radiation dominates the problem . -- SVR4 resembles a high-speed collision | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology between SVR3 and SunOS . - Dick Dunn | henry @ zoo.toronto.edu utzoo ! henry

Organization : Yale University Computer Science Dept. , New Haven , CT 06520-2158 Lines : 29 Distribution : world NNTP-Posting-Host : dolphin.zoo.cs.yale.edu Recently I 've come upon a body of literature which promotes colon cleansing as a vital aid to preventive medicine through nutrition . In particular , Dr. Bernard Jenssen in his book `` Colon Cleansing for Health and Longevity '' -- the title actually escapes me , but it is very similar to that -- claims that regular self-administered colonics , along with certain orally ingested `` debris-loosening agents '' , boosts the immune system to a significant degree . He also plugs a unique appliance called the `` Colema Board '' , which facilitates the self-administration of colonics . It sells for over $ 100 from a California-based company . He also plugs Vitra-Tox products as his chemical agents of choice : these include volcanic ash , supposedly for its electrical charge , and psyllium powder , for its bulkiness . If anyone knows anything about colon cleansing theory , its particulars , or the Colema Board and related products , I 'd be very interested to hear about research and personal experience .

Note that `` scientific evidence '' in this area does not prove any conclusions . There has been evidence to suggest that a certain part of homosexual's brains are different from heterosexuals- but that proves very little . Also notice that the apostles did not have with them the `` scientific evidence '' linking certain genes with alcoholism , or stealing with certain genetic problems . Even if they did have scientific evidence , I doubt it would have stopped them from communicating the teaching from the Holy Spirit that these things are sinful . This reminds me of a conversation with a professor of mine . He said something very true . Christianity teaches that we should not give in to our every inclination . Most people do give in to their leanings . In Christianity , we have the concept of struggling with the flesh , and bringing it into submission . One person may have a problem with his temper , and having a murderous heart , another may have a problem with homosexuality , another may be inclined to greed . But God offers us the opportunity to be more than conquerers . > sources where you can find this information , there is homosexual > behavior recorded among monkeys and other animals , which is in itself > suggestive that it is inherent rather than learned , or at least that > the word `` unnatural '' should n't really apply ... .

Funny you should mention . That 's the whole point 'paliks ' invariably miss . Source : 'United Nations , Human Development Report , ' 1990 .

Source : 'International Economics : Theory and Policy ' by Paul R. Krugman and Maurice Obstfeld , Harper Collins Publishers , 1991 , ( second edition ) . In terms of 'Annual Output Per Person in Dollars Adjusted to Purchasing Power Parity , ' Greece is in the same category with Turkiye . Indeed , Greek Governments have enormous problems to tackle . The economy is in shambles , corruption is rampant , air pollution is in outrageous dimensions , state-sponsored terrorism is the name of the game and infrastructure is decaying . Another insightful article in the New York Times ( Sunday , April 7 ) exposes the dirty linen of Greece , and describes her as the pariah of the European Community . The article reports that `` ... with un-European antics , Greece uses the Community as a cash register . She squanders , and at times even steals the European tax payers ' money for political featherbedding at home . The principal members of the Community admit that it was a mistake to accept Greece to the European Community . '' This affirmation is testimony to the fact that notwithstanding her geographic location , Greece is un-European in mentality and attitude . Indeed , during the last 12 years , Turkiye registered a great success with regard to economic restructuring . A sound economy , ready to be integrated to the world economies , has emerged , succeeding to the faltering one , witnessed in the '70s . Just 12 years ago , Greece used to export double as much as Turkiye did . Now inversely , Turkiye 's overall exports exceed by far that of Greece . As far as the tourism incomes are concerned , we are witnessing the same phenomenon . The governments in Turkiye have put a particular emphasis on the infrastructure investments ( rather than investing in world terrorist organizations ) , thereby solving this issue completely . Indeed , in the '70s , it was out of the question to conduct a telephone call from Eastern Anatolia to the West . Nowadays , this is not the case at all , and in a far remote town , even in a village you may have , at any time , a long-distance call to any given country . However , the same could not be applied to Greece . In fact , it is not so easy in Athens to have a trunk call to Germany round the clock . And if you happen to be in the Greek islands , then your chance will be pretty slim . Therefore , it would not be an exaggeration to argue that Turkiye is far ahead of Greece in regard to telecommunication facilities . Greece , by virtue of its full membership , has enjoyed all advantages of the EC , obtaining huge grants and extensive subsidies . Turkiye , having no access at all to similar financial supports , has nevertheless managed to create a better economy which enabled it to produce consecutive current accounts surplus over the last two years . As such , Turkiye deserves to be the only country in its region having permanent current accounts surplus . Serdar Argic 'We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the Turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination .

More than 2,000,000 residents of Croatia and B-H have *not* accepted the terms of secession which Tudjman and Izetbegovic unilaterally forced upon them . Croats and Muslims may have a right to negotiated secession but they do not have a right to grab the *entire* territories of the former Yugoslav republics of Croatia and B-H. Oh , BTW , *Yugoslavia* was *internationally recognized* when it was destroyed by Tudjman , Izetbegovic , Milosevic , and the international community led by Germany . If Yugoslavia 's borders could be changed against its will , then certainly Croatia 's borders and B-H 's borders can be changed as well . As I have stated many times : the civil war in ex-Yugoslavia will end when the terms of secession ( borders , etc . ) for Croatia and B-H are finally agreed upon . Serbs , Croats , and Muslims will *all* have to make territorial concessions to reach such an agreement . -Nick

These standards should facilitate the creation of REAL_TIME Online applications that make use of Voice , Video , Telecommuting , HiRes graphics , Conferencing , Distant Learning , Online order entry , Fax , in addition these dicussion would assist all to better understand how SGML , CALS , ODA , MIME , OODBMS , JPEG , MPEG , FRACTALS , SQL , CDrom , cdromXA , Kodak PhotoCD , TCL , V.FAST , and EIA/TIA562 , can best be incorporated and implemented to develop TELEMATIC/Multimedia applications . We want to be able to support DOS , UNIX , MAC , WINDOWS , NT , OS/2 platforms . It is our hope that individuals , developers , corporations , Universities , R & D labs would join in in supporting such an endeavor . This would be a NOT_FOR_PROFIT group with bylaws and charter . Already many corporations have decided to support OTG ( Open TELEMATIC Group ) so do not delay joining if you are a developer An RFD has been posted to form a usenet newsgroup and a FAQ will soon be be composed to start promulgating what is known on the subject . If you would like to be added to the maillist send email or mail to the address below . This group would publish an electronic quarterly NAPLPS/JPEG newsletter as well as a hardcopy version . We urge all who wants to see CMCs HiRes based applications & the NAPLPS/JPEG G R O W , decide to join and mutually benefit from this NOT-FOR_PROFIT endeavor .

From : mtabbott @ unix.amherst.edu ( MTA ) Subject : Atheism survey Nntp-Posting-Host : amhux3.amherst.edu Organization : Amherst College X-Newsreader : TIN [ version 1.1 PL7 ] Lines : 100 I am doing research on atheism , part of which involves field research here on the net . The following is a survey directed towards all readers of this group , intended to get data about the basis of atheistic belief . I would seriously appreciate it if each and every one of you would fill it out and mail it back to me at mtabbott @ unix.amherst.edu . First of all , I 've tried to structure questions that can be answered in a variety of ways , with varying amounts of detail ; it 's possible to give succinct answers to most everything , but there 's enough here to keep most of you typing for hours , I 'm sure . As much detail as you want to give me ( I mean it ) is great , but it 's also important for me to have as broad a base of individuals as possible , so even minimal responses are far better than nothing -- it 's a short survey if you just answer the questions without elaboration . Secondly , I hope some of the questions do n't come off as obnoxious ; I know that phrases like `` What would convince you of the existence of God '' imply that I am a seminary student intent on proving you all to be ignorant Godless heathens . In fact , I 'm not too sure about the existence of a higher power myself , so my use of `` God '' is a question of locution rather than ideology -- it 's easier than just repeating `` a deity or higher power '' every time . Also , I tend to use a lot of anthropological buzzwords like `` belief system '' although I know some of you might contend that you do n't have ANY beliefs , but are skeptical towards everything . I understand ; but you know what I mean . Think of such buzzwords as abbreviations for the rather unweildy phrases required to get the precise idea across . Lastly , thanks ! Please fill out as much as you can , in as much detail as you can , and send them to me . My research and I thank you . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Where would you place your beliefs , on the spectrum Theism < -- > Agnosticism < -- > Weak Atheism < -- > Strong Atheism ? Feel free to elaborate on your specific beliefs . In what , if any , religious tradition were you raised ? Did you ever believe in the existence of a God ? ( Several of the following questions presume that the answer to this is `` yes ; '' if you 've always been an atheist , or at least never a theist , you may have to modify the question/answer somewhat . ) How serious was your/your family 's involvement ? How and when did you start to doubt the tenets you were raised to believe ? How and when did your `` final break '' with your beliefs , if any , occur ? I realize that this is often more of an ongoing process than an `` event '' per se ; whatever the case , just describe it in whatever detail you wish . What contact with other atheists have you had ; before and after ( and during ) your `` conversion '' to atheism ? ( Certainly your involvement with alt.atheism counts -- how have net discussions affected your beliefs ? ) To what extent do you think other atheists have influenced you in your beliefs ? Did you come by your beliefs through discussion , through independent means , or by some combination of the two or other means ? Are you convinced that your beliefs were acquired through wholly rational means ( proofs of the non-existence of God , etc ) , or was it perhaps , at least in part , through other means ( alienation from mainstream religion , etc ) ? To what extent do you feel you `` understand '' the universe through your beliefs ? What phenomena of the universe and of human existence ( anything from physical phenomena to the problem of the existence of evil in human affairs ) do you feel are adequately dealt with by your beliefs , and where are they lacking as an explanatory method ? What would it take for you to question , or change , your beliefs ? What would convince you of the existence of God , what would convince you of the plausibility of God 's existence , and so forth ? How dynamic are your beliefs -- are they constantly changing ; have they stayed more or less the same for some time ? Are you involved in a career or education in science ? To what extent do you think science has influenced your beliefs ?

Well , when you say , without Morris , you have to mention an assumed replacement . If the alternative to Morris was letting Cito Gaston soft-toss the ball underhand to the opposition every 5 days , then of course the Blue Jays would n't have won without Morris . If the alternative was replacement level , then I think it would 've been very close , and yes , Morris might 've made the difference . If the alternative was Frank Viola , the Blue Jays probably would have won more easily with Viola . > Last year , when the team went 13-15 for the month of August , and all the > other starters were being shelled , and Milwaukee was making a charge , > Morris went 5-1 with a pretty good era ( I ca n't remember exactly ) .

What happened most of the time is that Morris fell behind , and the team came back and rescued him . Mostly , this is because he 's a lousy 1st inning pitcher , and much better the rest of the way . That the team can climb out of 4-0 , 5-0 holes consistently and win them 6-5 is not to Morris ' credit ; it 's to the team 's credit . Furthermore , while Morris did exceed the W-L percentage that would be projected from his runs allowed and run support , he has n't done this in previous years . In fact , his W-L record in 1991 is a lot worse than what it projects to be with run support and runs allowed . Do you think he just came up with this ability in 1992 . Look at the 2 postseason games he pitched decently in . Typical Morris games . Morris gets behind ; team rescues him . He 's not responsible for that rescue . And in both those games , the team just did n't rescue him enough . Jack Morris pitched as well as he did during much of the season in those 2 games ; the offense just didn't earn him a victory . > BTW , I think he should be put in the bullpen ; it would be embarrassing a > veteran pitcher which Cito would never do , but his era is 17+ , how much more > can he be embarrassed ? Morris is one of those guys who will reture when he ca n't start anymore ; he 's too bad a first inning pitcher to serve in the bullpen . Greg

Well , the fastest , crudest mixer ( aside from just physically connecting all your inputs together directly ) is to run each signal through a resistor to a common output . The resistors give some isolation so the signal sources are n't driving directly into each other . Taking a wild , seat-of-the-pants guess , I 'd say that if you are mixing high-impedance sources like some dynamic mikes , electric guitar pickups , etc. , your resistors ought to be maybe 5K - 10K or so .

Is that right ? > You might look for an allergy doctor in your area who uses sublingual drops instead of shots for treatment . ( You are given a small bottle of antigens ; 3 drops are placed under the tongue for 5 minutes . ) My allergy to bermuda grass was neutralized this way . Throughout the treatment process I had to return to the doctor 's office every month for re-testing and a new bottle of antigens . After the allergy was completely neutralized a bottle of maintenance antigens lasts me about 4 months ( the sublingual drops are then taken 3 times per week ) , and costs $ 20 . So the cost is less than shots and it is more convenient just to take the drops at home . Bruce Long

So , to all of you who refuse to believe there could be any conspiracy here , and say that the FBI was just stupid , I say I don't believe it . 2 ) The FBI has acces to the latest in audio and video technology -- the latest digital systems . The FBI can manufacture evidence . Need a tape of Koresh saying , `` light the fire '' , and you can have one . Need a thermal imaging video of three people lighting fires , and through the magic of computer graphics , you can have one . The thing is , manufacturing these pieces of evidence takes time .

I do n't like to see stickwork , but you have to clear players away from in front . My personal favorite move ( I 'm a goalie too ) is to give the offeding player a good whack on the back of their skates when the ref is n't looking . Makes 'em go down like a ton of bricks , but does n't cause injuries unless they do n't know how to fall ( I 'm talking about hitting the blades here , not the foot ) . It also makes the player you hit and anyone who sees really mad and apt to take a stupid retaliation penalty . Unfortunately , it also leaves your blocker out of position for a short time ...

Not when you stop at a STOP sign , not when she thinks you 're gon na crash , never . Keep them on the pegs until you tell her to get off the bike . b ) She is to hold onto your waist . She should hold on tightly enough that she wo n't slide off the bike if you twist the throttle a bit . And ( added bonus for you here ) , she should keep as close to your butt as possible so quick stops do n't make her slide into you and knock your balls up onto the gas tank . You decide how best to word this . c ) Just stay perpendicular to the bike ; straight up in the seat . Don't lean your body into curves , just go with the bike and stay perpendicular . Do n't look over your shoulder . * 3 ) Remember at all times that you have a passenger on the back . That means do n't pop the clutch , and try to corner and stop smoother than usual . Be aware that if you jump on the brake , you 're going to have the equivalent of a 100 lb . dead weight crashing into you from behind , so be prepared for that . 4 ) Make sure she pisses before the ride even if she says she doesn't have to go . No anti-women stuff here ; I have a tiny bladder myself . 5 ) Remind her to look around while you 're riding . Point to things of interest . It makes the ride more enjoyable to her ( she wo n't get so focused on just looking at the back of your helmet ) , and it gives her ample excuse to squeeze you to show she saw what you pointed at . * My wife and I tried the MSF-recommended `` look over the rider's shoulder in curves '' bit , and it just did n't work . The timing of her weight shift was unpredictable ( especially on the Maxim because , unlike the Ninja , the upright riding position really restricts the pillion 's view of the road ahead ) . Next time I had her just remain perpendicular to the bike , and I could hardly tell there was someone else on the bike in curves , and she weighs substantially over 100 lbs . -- Curtis Jackson cjackson @ mv.us.adobe.com '91 Hawk GT '81 Maxim 650 DoD # 0721 KotB '91 Black Lab mix `` Studley Doright '' '92 Collie/Golden `` George '' '' There is no justification for taking away individuals ' freedom in the guise of public safety .

Two notes of interest from Texas : The Tarrant Couonty ME ( who is doing the autopsies ) is well known for rendering judgements that are contrary to the police view . He presented evidence a few years ago that a man who police said was pointing a gun at them actually had his hands in the air . This does not bode well for the boys in black . The Texas Dept . of Public Saftey and the Texas Rangers have no great love for the ATF . I have heard them referred to as `` those fucking cowboys '' .

During the course of evening I asked Ohanus if he could tell me anything of the history of the village and the cause of its destruction . In his matter of fact way he replied , Yes , I assisted in its sack and destruction , and witnessed the slaying of those whose bones you saw to-day scattered among its ruins . '' p. 202 ( first and second paragraphs ) . `` We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work of extermination . Our troops surrounded village after village . Little resistance was offered . Our artillery knocked the huts into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable and inhabitants fled from them into fields , bullets and bayonets completed the work . Some of the Tartars escaped of course . They found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border into Turkey . The rest were killed . And so it is that the whole length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of Tartar villages . They are quiet now , those villages , except for howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the scattered bones of the dead . '' p. 15 ( second paragraph ) . `` The Tartars were , for the most part , poor . Some of them lived in villages and cultivated small farms ; many of them continued in the way of life of their nomadic forefathers . They drove their flocks and herds from valley to valley , from plain to mountain , and from mountain to plain , following the pasturage as it changed with the seasons . They ranged from the salt desert shores of the Caspian Sea far into the mighty Caucasus Mountains . Even the village Tartars are a primitive people , only semicivilized . '' `` I can see now that we Armenians frankly despised the Tartars , and , while holding a disproportionate share of the wealth of the country , regarded and treated them as inferiors . The fact that the Russians looked down upon all Armenians in much the same way as Armenians regarded Tartars , far from proving a bond between ourselves and our racially different neighbors , intensified an attitude and conduct on our part that served only to exacerbate hostility . '' p. 20 ( second paragraph ) . `` Our men armed themselves , gathered together and advanced on the Tartar section of the village . There were no lights in the houses and the doors were barred , for the Tartars suspected what as to happen and were in great fear . Our men hammered on the doors , but got no response ; whereupon they smashed in the doors and began a carnage that continued until the last Tartar was slain . Throughout the hideous night , I cowered at home in terror , unable to shut my ears to the piercing screams of the helpless victims and the loud shouts of our men . By morning the work was finished . '' p. 109 ( second paragraph ) . `` As things were , the members of the Dashnack Party were without administrative experience ; consequently the government they instituted quickly proved itself incompetent to rule by legitimate means . The members of the government had been revolutionists working in secret and outside the law . When they became a legally instituted , recognized governing body with the destiny of Armenia in their hands , they proved incompetent to do better than resume the terrorist tactics that had characterized their fight against the Russian and Turkish Governments in their outlaw days . The outstanding feature of their rule , now that they were in power , was , as in the old days , trial and execution without hearing . A man evoking the displeasure of the government or of some official would be tried and condemned without arrest or preference of charges against him . The method of execution was for a government 'mauserist ' to walk up behind the condemned man in his home or on the street , place a pistol to the back of his head and blow out his brains . This simple way of getting rid of those who were undesirable in the view of the government and soon became a common way of paying debts . '' p. 203 ( first paragraph ) . `` A soldier succeeded in driving his bayonet through the Tartar . I saw the point of the weapon emerge through his back . ... Another soldier seized a rock and pounded the Tartar 's head with it ... The Armenian who had bayoneted him sprang to his feet , wrested the weapon from the Tartar 's body , and , raising it to his lips , licked it clean of blood , exclaiming in Russian , 'Slodkey ! Slodkey ! ' ( Sweet . ) '' p. 203 ( second paragraph ) . `` One evening I passed through what had been a Tartar village . Among the ruins a fire was burning . I went to the fire and saw seated about it a group of soldiers . Among them were two Tartar girls , mere children . The girls were crouched on the ground , crying softly with suppressed sobs . Lying scattered over the ground were broken household utensils and other furnishings of Tartar peasant homes . There were also bodies of the dead . '' p. 204 ( first paragraph ) . `` I was soon asleep . In the night I was awakened by the persistent crying of a child . I arose and went to investigate . A full moon enabled me to make my way about and revealed to me all the wreck and litter of the tragedy that had been enacted . Guided by the child 's crying , I entered the yard of a house , which I judged from its appearance must have been the home of a Turkish family . There in a corner of the yard I found a women dead . Her throat had been cut . Lying on her breast was a small child , a girl about a year old . '' p. 118 . `` Slowly the train of oxcarts lumbered along through the snow , the cart jolting and the loads swaying . Boys ran along the line of oxen , encouraging them with shrill Tartar cries , and belaboring the beasts with sticks . In the carts , the women , veiled as is the Tartar way , held children in their arms . Wrapped in blankets and huddled among the goods that burdened the carts they sought protection from the wind and cold . A few old men plodded along on foot . Across the road through the ravine a barrier had been thrown . The leading oxteam reached this barrier and halted . The gunmen and other ruffians concealed among the rocks opened fire . Women and children leaped and scrambled from the carts , screamed , ran and sought vainly for safety . This massacre was not complete . The Armenian soldiers in the near-by barracks , hearing the firing and the turmoil , hurried to the scene ... . That same day the abandoned Tartar quarter of Alexandropol was looted and completely destroyed .

I have been on the scenes of massacres where the dead lay on the ground , in numbers , like the fallen leaves in a forest . They had been as helpless and as defenseless as sheep . They had not died as soldiers die in the heat of battle , fired with ardor and courage , with weapons in their hands , and exchanging blow for blow . They had died as the helpless must , with their hearts and brains bursting with horror worse than death itself . '' p. 133 ( first paragraph ) '' In this movement we took with us three thousand Turkish soldiers who had been captured by the Russians and left on our hands when the Russians abandoned the struggle . During our retreat to Karaklis two thousand of these poor devils were cruelly put to death . I was sickened by the brutality displayed , but could not make any effective protest . Some , mercifully , were shot . Many of them were burned to death .

The Branch Davidians made the mistake of confusing the message with the messenger . They believed Koresh was a prophet , and therefore believed everything he said . The problem was n't the religion , it was the followers . They did n't die because of faith and dogma , they died because of their zealotry ( or , in the case of the children , the zealotry of their parents ) . > I have expressed this notion in the past . Some Christians debated > with me whether Christianity leaves any room for reasoning . I claimed > rationality is quelled out of Christianity by faith and dogma . So Christians are totally irrational ? Irrational with respect to their religion only ? What are you saying ? One 's belief in a Christian God does not make one totally irrational . I think I know what you were getting at , but I 'd rather hear you expand on the subject . > A philosopher can not be a Christian because a philosopher can change his mind , > whereas a Christian can not , due to the nature of faith and dogma present > in any religion . Again , this statement is too general . A Christian is perfectly capable of being a philosopher , and absolutely capable of changing his/her mind . Faith in God is a belief , and all beliefs may change . Would you assert that atheists would make poor philosophers because they are predisposed to not believe in a God which , of course , may show unfair bias when studying , say , religion ? > I claimed that a `` Christian philosopher '' is not a Christian , > but is a person whose beliefs at the moment correspond with those > of Christianity .

Ever heard of parole ? You have read far too much into this subject . A Christian is one who follows the religion based on the teachings of a man named Jesus Christ .

Which Sweeney you ask ... well , of course Bob Sweeney , the one that Boston let Buffalo get a hold of ( they still have 2 Sweeneys which makes things slightly confusing ) . Game winner in OT in game 1 , and another BIG goal ( seconds after Fuhr made 3 point blank saves - > this is why Grant has 5 rings ! ! ! ) to put Buffalo ahead in the 3rd . Yes , Neely countered a minute later , but had n't this course of Buffalo going ahead after being tied and shutting down another few great scoring opportunities , I think Boston would have notched their first win of the series . Well , the Sabres have n't made it to the end of this series yet , but I certainly feel they 've got Boston right were they want them ... actually , they 've got them in a position that neither Buffalo nor Boston felt that would come about . One more astronomical game by Fuhr , a few more heroics by the rest of the team ( this is a team sport afterall ) and I think Borque , Neely , Jouneau ( sp ? ) , and Company are gon na be swinging a new stick ( Weather is perfect for golf season ) real soon . I 'm not gon na waiger anything on this , because I 've seen some really strange things happen in both pro and college hockey . Talking about golf ... was that a hockey swing , golf swing or baseball swing that Hawerchuck used in the last shot of the game that Khmylev deflected in for the BIG ONE ? The whole OT ( all 1 minute of it ! ) was a tesiment to Buffalo 's ability to really be persistent and grind it out in the end ( something they were n't necessarily in the regular season ) . The Sabres pushed hard and forced Borque to blatently take down Bodger in the opening seconds . I do n't normally like penalties being called in such ultra-critical points , but this was BLATENT . Finally , the Sabres won a faceoff ( they were n't that hot in this dept the rest of the game ) when LaFontaine scooped at the puck 3 times . When Hawerchuck took his shot ( quite a boomer , but Blue stopped this one ) he took a few steps over to get his own rebound and slapped at it again , without setting it up . I did n't realize it went in until the announcer started screaming , '' They score , THEY SCORE ! ! ! '' . The best was seeing LaFontaine jumping up and down , skating a little bit , jumping some more , and then skating over to Brad May who he jumped on . Doug McKee mckee @ cs.buffalo.edu

I 'd suggest writing a detailed letter about the incident to the hospital administrator . Specify the date and time . If possible the names of the technicians . Send a copy to the clinician under whose care your friend was admitted . I say this because , though your friend has no argument with the doctor , I have found that administrators sometimes ignore complaints until the patient becomes litigious . Clinicians may not have been informed of the complaint and are very surprised to find themselves named in a suit . If there is no response within a week send a follow up letter . Attach a photocopy of the original letter . Do this weekly until you do get a response . CAT scans are non-invasive but they can be very scary . The scanner can be a bad place for the claustrophobic . There was an interesting study in the BMJ , about 10 years ago , which found that around 10 % of people who had CAT scans found it so unpleasant that they would never have another . This compares with 15 % who said the same about a lumbar puncture . Don Mackie - his opinions

Got it in one . Similarly , a moral relativist will not judge one moral system to be better than another in every possible circumstance . This does not , however , preclude him from judging one moral system to be better than another in a specific set of circumstances .

Sorry , but that 's not so . I can provide a justification for asserting that the moral system of the terrorist is inferior to that of the man of peace . I just ca n't provide a justification which works in all possible circumstances . Similarly , I can provide a justification for asserting that bullets move faster than snails .

The form the operations that compute R1 , R2 , and R3 is , of course , the famous `` triple encryption '' suggested for use with DES . It 's much stronger than a single encryption , and has an effective key length of 160 bits . For reasons that were discussed when DES was first standardized , a simple double encryption would not have the same strength . Triple encryption has been used by IBM since more or less the beginning to encrypt other keys . It 's recommended for anything of very high value . And I think we can agree that the R_i and S_i fit that description . Why n_1 , n_2 , and n_3 ? Well , you need different plaintext values . I have no idea if they 'll be disclosed or not . At a guess , they're constructed so that they differ in as many bit positions as possible . A goo cryptosystem will scramble things a lot with even a 1-bit change -- but the values of N in a series will have fairly similar bit patterns , and there might , conceivably , be a weakness . So the n_i values are -- and I 'm guessing -- chosen to increase the Hamming distance . In any event , I 'm quite convinced that one can not go back to the S_i from the U_i , let alone U . ( Observe : if the NSA has U , they don't need to find S_i . But even if they do , they ca n't get U_1 and U_2 . In theory , they should never even see those values , even with a warrant . ) The real question , I think , is why use this scheme at all , as opposed to a hardware random number generator . My answer is that this is *much* more verifiable . Look -- suppose that NSA , NIST , the ACLU , the EFF , and the NRA combined to build a *really* good random number generator , and that it passed every test you could think of . When you come back next week to program some more chips , does it still work that well ? Have any components changed in value ? Have the components been changed out from under you ? Does it still work well the in the presence of a focused microwave beam that tends to bias it towards selecting 1 bits ? Yes , you can run detailed statistical tests on it again , but that 's hard . Consider , on the other hand , a software solution . You bring your own floppies with you , you can run cryptographic checksums , etc . It 's a lot easier to verify that the software is unchanged , in other words . ( Yes , I can think of ways to cheat software , too . I think that they're a lot harder . ) There are three issues with Clipper . The first is whether or not the architecture of the whole scheme is capable of working . My answer , with one significant exception , is yes . I really do think that NSA and NIST have designed this scheme about as well as can be , assuming that their real objectives are as stated : to permit wiretapping , under certain carefully-controlled circumstances , with a minimum risk of abuse . ( The exception is that U exists outside of the chip , on a programming diskette . That 's seriously wrong . U_1 and U_2 should be loaded onto the chip separately . ) To those who disagree ( and I don't claim my answer is obvious , though I found my own reasoning sufficiently persuasive that I was forced to rewrite the Conclusions section of my technical analysis paper -- I had originally blasted the scheme ) , I issue this invitation : assume that you were charged with implementing such a system , with complete regard for civil rights and due process . What would you do differently ? In answering this question , please accept NSA 's fundamental assumptions : that both strong cryptography against outsiders , and the ability to wiretap *some* domestic users , is necessary . ( If you feel it necessary to challenge those assumptions , do it in the context of the last issue I present below . Right here , I 'm discussing *just* the technical aspects . And no , I do n't by any means claim that just because something can be done , it should be . ) The second issue is whether or not this whole architecture is actually going to be used . Just because Clipper chips are made this way doesn't mean that that 's the only way they 'll be made . Maybe the NSA will substitute its own chips between the programming facility and the shipping dock . And they 'll generate bogus warrant requests , so that the escrow agents do n't wonder why they 've never called . ( `` Sorry , guys ; all them terrorists and drug dealers and pedophiles seem to have bought triple-DES phones instead . Who 'd ' a ' thunk it ? '' ) I have no answer to this question , and at the moment , I do n't see a way of answering it . Those concerns are part of my reasoning in my answer to the final question , below . The third , and most serious issue , is whether or not Clipper is a good idea even if carried out strictly according to the letter of the law . I think that the answer is no , but it 's not a no-brainer . I 'm a civil libertarian , not a libertarian , for reasons that I explained at great length on the net in the Elder Days , and that I do n't have the energy to repeat now . But that means that I 'm willing to accept that some laws are necessary , so long as they respect the essential rights of individuals . The government already has the ability and -- in our system -- the right to issue search warrants , and while that power has certainly been abused , it 's also been used quite properly and fairly in other cases . Is key escrow sufficiently different ? I think so -- but again , it 's not an easy question for me . ( It is easy for libertarians to answer , of course , since Clipper is completely alien to much of the rest of their ( oft-admirable ) philosophy . And it 's also easy for those who give their unreserved trust to government , a group I 'm much more distant from . ) -- Steve Bellovin

And yes , > baseball includes the space between plays as well as the plays themselves . I hesitate to make assumptions about other people when they write , but neither of you two *sound* as though you have kids , and you may not have spouses either . Consider a night game starting at 7:05 PM EST . ( It was 7:35 last year , but Cleveland showed what I thought was good sense in pushing it back . ) I go , and I 'm into it until 11 PM minimum . Extra innings could put me well past midnight . Even without extra innings , if the score is beyond 2-1 I ca n't see my family that night at all . If the next day is a workday , I may have to bag that as well . Further , the later the game goes , the colder it gets on the shore of Lake Erie .

As a self-proclaimed atheist , I believe that *some* conceptions of god are inconsistent or in conflict with fact , and I lack belief in other conceptions of god merely because there is no reason for me to believe in these . I usually use the word agnostic to mean someone who believes that the existence of a god is unknown inherently unknowable . Note that this is a positive belief that is quite different from not believing in a god ; I do not believe in a god , but I also do not believe the agnostic claim . Russell

We typically have several of these running in windows , plus a data producer serving some device and setting the flag . Everyone blocking makes sure the device server gets to run . Xt and Xm also have a 'main loop ' model that we must fit into . O'Reilly Vol IV Ch 9 discusses adding a file-watcher and also how to add workprocs that are run during idle time . We can 'open-up ' our existing main loop and call it as a workproc . The problem is our blocking until new data is no longer appropriate . Neither is letting the program free-run because others are hurt . The unix select call lets you block until any of several i/o are ready . We want that for the X main loop except not file i/o .

No , they do not work well . My doctor started using one recently , and I thought the concept was so amazing that I bought one too . The thing works by reading the infrared emissions from the ear drum . The ear drum is hotter than the ear canal walls , so you have to point the thing very carefully . This means tugging on the top of the ear to straighten out the ear canal , then inserting the thing snugly , then pushing a button . Unfortunately , there are many things that can go wrong . It is almost impossible to aim the thing correctly when you do it on yourself . I get readings which differ from each other by up to 2 degrees , and may differ from an oral thermometer by up to 2 degrees . I talked to one of the nurses in my doctor 's office recently about this , and she said she did n't like them either , for same reasons . She did give me some instruction on how to tug on my ear , and what correct insertion feels like , but she said she thought it was impossible to do correctly on one 's self . She also said that she and other nurses had complained to the company about inaccurate readings , and that someone from the company had told them to take great care to clean the infrared window at the end of the probe with alcohol from time to time . She demonstrated this prior to reading my temperature , and managed to get a reading within 0.5 degree of the oral temperature I took at home before driving to the Dr 's office . I have also noticed tha some nurses click the button , then remove the probe immediately . This causes wrong readings . In my experience , you have to leave the probe in a good 1 to 2 seconds after clicking the button to get a good measurement . The nurse I talked with agreed . I suspect that many people do n't realize this , and therefore get bad readings for yet another reason . In short , it 's a great idea . It may work for some folks , but I believe it does n't work well for a person who wants to take his own temperature .

Of the ~93 % ( I have heard figures closer to 80 % , but I wo n't quibble your figures ) , most was dropped in carpet bombing of regions only occupied by enemy troops . A B-52 drops a lot of bombs in one sortie , and we used them around the clock . Not to mention other smaller aircraft using dumb munitions . 2 . The Patriot uses a proximity fuse . The adjusted figures for number of Patriot kills of SS-1 derivitives is ~60-70 % . That figure came not from some fluke in the Pentagon , but a someone working with such stuff in another part of DoD . 3 . The statement precision bombing was the norm , is true around areas where civilians were close to the target . We dropped by tonnage very little bombs in populated regions , explaining the figures . > And of the 7 % that was the `` smart '' stuff , 35 % hit . Again - try to follow me > here - that means 65 % of this `` smart '' arsenal missed . This figure , is far below all the other figures I have seen . If it is indeed accurate , then how do you explain the discrepancy between that figure , and other figures from international organizations ? Most figures I have seen place the hit ratio close to 70 % , which is still far higher than your 35 % . Or does your figure say a bomb missed if the plane took off with it , and the bomb never hit the target , regardless of whether or not the bomb was dropped ? Such methods are used all the time to lie with statistics . > > The stories > > of `` hundreds of thousands '' of Iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk . > > Prove it .

Both players have a reputation of being excellent fastball hitters , and both have a reputation of being fooled too often with slow curves and change ups . Sabo has more power , and a little bit of a better batting eye . Samuel is noted as an agressive free-swinger . Sabo has more homerun power . Both players started the game hitting below .200 . There may have been some game considerations that might have prompted Perez to want to reserve Samuel for use later . But the game *was* on the line , and Samuel never did get in .

Look at Matt Williams the year after : Mitchell was gone . Look no further . Not a scientific : study , but it 'll show the truth for Matt . Besides , Bonds : _wants_ to bat 5th I had thought that Williams batted after Mitchell . Would n't that show that Williams does better at 5th rather than 4th ? The point is moot , though , becase Clark pretty much demands to be 3rd and , like you point out , Bonds does like to bat 5th . The only person left to bat 4th is Williams .

They were outworked and outplayed by the Wings in the first two games . But Burns must have kicked their behinds cause they sure came out in full gear ( or is that high gear ? ) in game 3 . Except for a 10-15 minute stretch in the 2nd period , they outskated and outworked the Wings . Please don't flame this statement 'cos you know it 's true ! I have to admit that goaltending was the key . Potvin kept the Leafs ahead during the sleepy stretch the Leafs went through in the 2nd . He also kept the rebounds to a minimum , something that cost Cheveldae 2 goals . Clark even looked like he had stopped moping ( first star ! ) , although I still do n't know why he was so flat in games 1 and 2 . If the Leafs play the same style and can keep the pace they had in game 3 , they may actually have a chance of winning this series ( a slim chance , but a chance ... .I 'm no RM ... ..where is he anyways ? haha ) .

It reduces to # # ( 1 ) : Alterian dosh arriving in my account is due to [ benefactor or bug ] . # # ( 2 ) : this is not evidence for [ benefactor ] , neither is it evidence for # [ bug ] ( meaning that it does n't lend more weight to one than to the # other ) # # ( 3 ) : therefore no evidence can exist for [ benefactor ] and no evidence # can exist for [ bug ] . # # But ( 3 ) relies on a shift in meaning from ( 2 ) . When you say ( paraphrased ) # in ( 2 ) that this is not `` evidence for [ benefactor ] '' , for example , what you # mean is that it 's no *more* evidence for [ benefactor ] than it is for [ bug ] . Yes , that 's what I mean . # In ( 3 ) , however , you 've shifted the meaning of `` evidence for [ benefactor ] '' # so that it now means ` absolute ' `` evidence for [ benefactor ] '' rather than # ` relative ' `` evidence for [ benefactor ] '' w.r.t . [ bug ] . Not really , I meant evidence that would tend to one over the other . I think this is just a communications problem . What I am trying to say , in my clumsy way , is that while I buy your theory as far as it relates to theism making predictions ( prayer , your 'Rapture ' example ) , I don't buy your use of Occam 's razor in all cases where A=0 . In my example , one could n't dismiss [ benefactor ] or [ bug ] on the grounds of simplicity - one of these is necessary to explain the dosh . I brought up the 'one-by-one dismissal ' process to show that it would be wrong to do so . From what you 're saying in this post , it seems you agree , and we 're talking at cross-purposes . # ( 3 ) is still in contradiction to ( 1 ) . # # Some sums may help . With B = benefactor , b = bug , d = dosh arrives in account : # # ( 1 ) implies P ( B+b | d ) = 1 # # Assuming that P ( Bb | d ) = 0 , so it 's either the benefactor *or* a bug # which is responsible if the bucks arrive , but not both , then # # P ( B+b | d ) = P ( B | d ) + P ( b | d ) # # so # # P ( B | d ) + P ( b | d ) = 1 # # but ( 3 ) implies that # # P ( B | d ) = 0 and P ( b | d ) = 0 . No , this is n't what I meant . P ( B | d ) = 0.5 and P ( b | d ) = 0.5 , with necessarily no new observation ( we 've already seen the dosh ) to change those estimates . I was trying to say ( again , in my clumsy way ) that it would be _wrong_ to assign 0 probability to either of these . And that's precisely what use of the Razor does in the case of gods - gods are one class of hypothesis ( there are many others ) belonging to a set of hypotheses _one_of_which_ is necessary to explain something which otherwise would _not_ be satisfactorily explained . It can be thrown out or retained on grounds of non-rational preference , not of science or statistics . Alternatively , one could chuck out or retain the lot , on the grounds that the answer ca n't be known , or that the notional probability estimates are effectively useless , being equal ( agnosticism/weak atheism ) . # > As they do when the set M is filled by `` the universe is caused by x '' , # > where x is gods , pink unicorns , nothing , etc . - and no observation # > tends to one conclusion over the other . # # Exactly the point I was making , I think . So we do n't `` throw out '' any of # these , contrary to your assertion above that we do . Some people do , Simon , and they think they are doing excellent science .

See my post on the other branch of this # thread . Then you seem to be guilty of the contradiction you accuse me of . If the razor holds for gods , then it holds for all like hypotheses . Which means that you 're assigning P ( x | H [ i ] ) =0 for all i , though we 've already established that it 's not correct to do so when SUM ( P ( x|H [ i ] ) ) =1 over all i . # > Simply put , anyone who claims to have a viable proof of the existence or # > non-existence of gods , whether inductive or no , is at best mistaken , and # > at worst barking mad . # # Luckily I make no such claim , and have specifically said as much on numerous # occasions .

When I say that something is # '' evidence against '' an hypothesis , that does n't imply that observation of # the said something necessarily *falsifies* the hypothesis , reducing the # estimate of P ( H | data ) to zero .

And I 'm not constructing a strawman ( though it's certainly possible that I 've misunderstood what you 're saying ) . However , by any standards , a system that says when A=0 , gods are highly unlikely , and when A ! =0 gods can be dismissed using the Razor , is a system purporting to be an inductive proof that gods either do n't exist , or are unnecessary to explain any or all phenomena . In my experience , systems such as this ( including those which purport to prove that gods exist ) always contain a fallacy upon close examination .

From : Rick_Granberry @ pts.mot.com ( Rick Granberry ) Subject : Boston C of C Reply-To : Rick_Granberry @ pts.mot.com ( Rick Granberry ) Organization : Motorola Paging and Telepoint Systems Group Lines : 263 Note : the following article is submitted on behalf of someone ( Frank daniels ) who has difficulty posting to s.r.c , email replies to daniels @ math.ufl.edu I am unable to post to the bitnet groups . Here is a capsule history of the Shepherding/Discipleship Movement in the Churches of Christ ( i.e . Crossroads/Boston ) : I could trace the Movement back as far as 1800 , and indeed some of its roots go back that far , but these were really `` influences '' on the Movement , and not the actual movement , per se . I will start in c.1920 . In that day , there were 'white ' churches and 'colored ' churches in nearly every area ( due to segregation ) . Modern Pentecostalism was developing as a predominantly 'colored ' phenomenon . Here , there was great fanaticism , emphasis on emotional experiences , and belief in a personal guidance and indwelling of the Holy Spirit . Many 'white ' Protestant churches were growing into what became known as conservative fundamentalism . By the 1940s , the evangelical movement was in full swing , and many groups were becoming part of it . When the civil rights movement grew stronger ( in the 1950 's and 1960 's ) , many 'white ' church groups began to be influenced by the 'black ' churches and by what was going on there . This spread started in the most liberal of groups and spread to the more conservative ones by the late '60 's . In 1969 , even the Catholic Church was displaying evidence of influence by the other groups ... still evident today . The Churches of Christ are ( and were ) a very conservative Protestant group . When the influence from outside began to reach the CofC in c.1965 , it was generally not appreciated . Conservative groups are very strongly resistant to change , and the new movement was VERY different from the CofC status quo . The magazines put out at that time by CofC folks tell the story as it unfolds . New ideas came into the CofC . There was a big push to reach out to college students , young adults , and teens . Some called this the Campus Evangel- ism Movement . Emotions , generally not highly regarded in the CofC at large , played a more important role in the new movement . In some places , people began to speak in tongues ( as their Pentecostal predecessors did ) . This was met with extreme criticism from within the Churches of Christ . In some places , people were fired from their jobs for speaking in tongues or for advocating the `` Holy Spirit Movement '' , another name for the new branch . The term `` Underground Church of Christ '' also came into use because these people had to hide their differences ( or they might be ostricised ) . There were several congregations , however , whose leaderships were receptive to the new ideas ( at least in part ; the tongues-speaking never really caught on ) . One of these was the 14th Street Church of Christ in Gainesville , FL . Campus Ministry had already been regarded as important at 14th Street , and the new ideas seemed to be very helpful tools for evangelism . They also seemed to put vitality into the church , which many felt had been lacking . In October of 1967 , the 14th Street congregation hired Chuck Lucas to be its Campus Minister . By 1970 , he would move to being the congregation's ( lead ) Minister . In the late 60's/early 70 's , the congregation worked with many other groups . They held Bible discussions at Daytona Beach during Spring Break . They organized talks in the fraternities on the University of Florida campus . They also worked with UF sports people . In 1972 , the congregation ordered a larger building to be constructed . When it was finished , the group moved and changed its name ( now no longer appropriate ) . It became the Crossroads Church of Christ from then on , a name that would become legendary . By this time , Crossroads was basically the only CofC whose programs were fully aligned to the new movement . While they did n't start it , they continued it and were responsible for where it wound up going . By 1975 , none of the other Churches of Christ in the area felt that they could cooperate with Crossroads , due to what they recognized as doctrinal problems at Crossroads . Crossroads had begun to heavily emphasize , and later require attendance at all church functions . It was seen as a good thing for each member to have at least one close relationship , a person with whom you would share all of your problems , pray , and get help from . The concept was called Prayer Partners , which later became Discipleship Partners and also later became mandatory . The leadership was assigning prayer partners to people for a while . The book called `` The Master Plan of Evangelism '' was a strong influence on Chuck Lucas . He ( and the group ) believed that it was every person 's duty and life purpose to carry out the great commission . Crossroads was growing in number , and numbers became VERY important ( some would say all-important ) . A person who `` was evangelistic '' was `` spiritual '' . Evangelism meant inviting people to Crossroads events ; if you did this a lot and some of them converted , then you were `` spiritual '' . There were sermons about how if you bought groceries , the cashier and bag boy ought to receive invitations to services . Everyone at your job ought to receive invitations . Since these people needed Jesus , you should be `` aggressive '' -- do n't take 'no ' for an answer . If you did not evangelize enough , you came to be called `` lazy '' or '' unspiritual '' . By the end of the decade , the Prayer Partner system was integrated into a structure . The Elders and Ministers were on top ( like a big pyramid ) . Then the group leaders , Bible study leaders , and members . Everyone who came in had someone placed over them . It is at this time , 1978-1980 , that the bad press about Crossroads began to circulate . The problem with rape on the University of Florida campus was tremendous , but Crossroads was considered a bigger and more immediate problem . There were many complaints about the congregation and its `` pushy '' evangelistic tactics . Crossroads was considering the other Churches of Christ to be `` dead '' churches , which aggravated them ; it was aggressively recruiting out of the other church groups ( denominations ) , which aggravated THEM . By this time , Crossroads had grown numerically to the point ( 1100 ) where not only did they believe that they would soon need a new building , but also they were sending out `` planting '' [ create a new church ] and '' reconstructing '' [ reorganize an existing church ] teams to other cities . By this time , the Crossroads Movement was underway . A group was sent to the 30-member Lexington Church of Christ in Boston , MA . The team was headed up by Kip McKean , who had been converted out of a fraternity by Crossroads ( in Gainesville ) . Kip held a still stronger view of church authority , which he believed was heavily vested in the Evangelist ( s ) , and not so much in the Elders . He had been fired in 1977 from the congregation that he had been working at when the elders there found numerous things wrong with his theology , including the practice of what came to be called one-over- one Christianity . [ Called this by critics ] In the first year , half of the 30 people felt that they did not want to be a part of the new congregation . They left . But others began coming into the new Boston Church of Christ . Ah , but I 'm ahead of myself . At Crossroads , the heavy-handed system had begun to take its toll on the members . Many have said that they felt that they were working hard , but they were not achieving the results that were so important . The numbers were dropping . From 1978 , Crossroads membership declined steadily . The leadership began to tighten the reigns on the congregation , who was seen as being largely '' unproductive '' and `` unfruitful '' . The `` fruit '' passages in the NT were interpreted as referring to new converts . If you were not bearing fruit , said John 15 , you would be cast into the fire ! [ Boston still teaches this . ] If you love your neighbor , you 'll save his soul ( invite him to church and convert him ) . If you 're not doing that , you do n't love your neighbor . And if you do n't love , you 're in danger of backsliding . The logical arguments continue in this vein . In 1985 , Chuck Lucas was fired from his job as minister , due to recurring sins in his life . These struggles were never revealed to the congregation at large , although many people outside the congregation had heard about them . For by now , there was very little contact ( on a friendship level ) between most Crossroads members and those outside . [ If you have contact , your focus should be on converting them . Bring them to a Bible Study . ] Chuck 's replacement was Joe Woods , who was fully supportive of the Boston system . As Boston grew in number , they began to offer 'training ' sessions for other ministers . Joe went to Boston to be trained and returned to Cross- roads ready to emphasize the `` total commitment '' to the church that Boston and Kip McKean were now emphasizing . Eventually , in Fall of 1987 , the Elders at Crossroads ( now 2 in number -- Dick Whitehead and Bill Hogle ) made a decision . Boston was demanding that all of the other churches in the movement come under the direction of the church in Boston . The Elders refused , citing their belief that each church should be autonomous ( something true in all non-Boston Churches of Christ ) . Perhaps there was also some degree of offense done here , since Crossroads was no longer the 'example ' to the rest of the Movement . The group now numbered about 800 , while Boston was now larger ( in membership ) . The Churches of Christ generally teach that baptism is a necessary element of salvation . At Crossroads , they taught what was called 'Lordship' baptism : you had to understand the commitment involved before you could be baptized . You had to 'count the cost ' . At Boston , they took this a step further . If at some time you became `` unproductive '' , then your spirituality was suspect . People would begin to ask you if you REALLY understood what you were getting into . Anyone who said 'no ' had their baptism deemed invalid : they had n't counted the cost properly . They still had to be baptized . Others called this `` rebaptism '' , and Crossroads did n't approve of this practice . When Crossroads announced that it would not follow Boston , many of its members left Crossroads and went to Movement-related ministries , which were now called Discipling Ministries . You were either discipling ( evangelizing ) or you were `` dead '' . They also used the nickname `` Movement of God '' for a while . By Summer of 1988 , Crossroads was withdrawn from the Movement and now stood alone . They had few to no allies in the mainstream Churches of Christ , and now none in the Movement . Boston , however , continued to chart its course in the direction that they had been following . They sent `` reconstruction teams '' to many cities , which usually meant that they split the church there . They stopped acknowledging other churches of Christ as Christians and began to call themselves the `` remnant '' . The `` remnant '' of the Jews in the OT are those who are saved by God . It was felt that the `` remnant '' today represents all the Christians . Sometimes they would simply call their Movement `` the church '' . They usually took the name of the city for their name , implying to the other Churches of Christ that Boston did not recognize their existence . Many campuses have now formally forbidden Boston ministries from recruiting there due to the number of complaints . In some cases , it has been documented that Boston ministries have lied to University officials in order to continue to have access to the campus . Any resistance that they experience is termed `` perse- cution '' , which all true Christians are expected to experience . Are you really a Christian if you 're not being persecuted ? The numbers at Boston peaked at c.3000 in 1989 . Since then , they have fought to remain steady . I have heard a tape of Kip McKean shouting at the leaders for failing to fulfill the Great Commission ( their life 's purpose ) as God commanded them . Their Christianity is highly centered on commands and obedience . Crossroads once was called a cult . Boston is now recognized by the Cult Awareness Network and other national and international groups as a cult , under a formal definition , because of the techniques which they employ . The term `` cult '' is usually differentiated from `` sect '' by the practice of those techniques . The techniques which they employ are recognized by many as being techniques of destructive pursuasion , also used by other Shepherding Discipleship groups . [ Robert Jay Lifton , Margaret Thaler Singer , and many others have written about the topic . ] These techniques include guilt motivation , emotional manipulation , loaded language , the aura of sacred science ( a sort of mystic element seen in everyday events ) , and others . I have no particular axe to grind against the Movement . I have numer- ous friends who are still part of the Movement . I have never had a 'falling out ' with anyone in the Movement . I disagree with many things which they teach . I recognize the psychological damage done by being involved in such a system . I hold no loyalty to the mainstream Churches of Christ and do not defend their mistakes either . I want to point out , though , that unlike in many other systems which are in other ways similar , the Leadership of the Boston Movement are as much victims of the system as the members . We do not have a leader who enjoys manipulating his people . The leaders believe what they teach , and they feel accountable for the activites ( and spiritual welfare ) of the members . When members do not evangelize to their expectations , for example , the leaders feel personally responsible as well . The leaders are not out for money or power . They want to evangelize the world in their lifetime . I have said too much , but there is much more to say . There are many examples I could give and quotes from other sources ( including Boston bulletins ) that I could include . But this is too long already . You may post this if you so desire .

Your problem is either being caused by excessive voltage drop in the long cable from the generator , or just plain not having enough power . I would suspect that those amps are going to draw a lot of current on short peaks . You can try using larger ( and shorter ) cables to the generator , or try strapping the amps for 240V service and running 240V mains cables out , which will minimize the line drop . If these do n't work , though , you're going to need a bigger generator . I assume that you 're using well-maintained generators , and have watched the voltage output on the generator properly . If you do n't have 120V coming out of the unloaded generator you 'll never get 120V at the other end . > Can anyone offer any advice ?

From : Center for Policy Research < cpr @ igc.apc.org > Subject : Labour 's enclaves policy.IMPORTANT Nf-ID : # N : cdp:1483500378:000:11604 Nf-From : cdp.UUCP ! cpr May 11 05:21:00 1993 Lines : 247 From : Center for Policy Research < cpr > Subject : Labour 's enclaves policy.IMPORTANT Labour 's enclaves policy in the occupied territories by Israel Shahak publ . in Middle East International , London , 30.4.93 It is not difficult to discover Israel 's policy towards the Palestinians at any given time . It can be easily inferred from the facts on the ground and from the information provided by the Hebrew press . There is one condition , though . The torrents of claptrap about `` the peace process '' must be totally ignored , as must Israel 's official pronouncements , whole sole purpose is to distort reality . By concentrating only on the facts , it was early apparent that Labour 's policies were no different from those of Shamir but for their greater reliance on deceit and their more effective implementation . Likud 's policies were accurately described by Ariel Sharon in an article , accompanied by a map , in Yediot Aharonot last August . The Sharon plan envisaged a division of the West Bank into seven , and the Gaza Strip into four , `` autonomous '' Palestinian enclaves , all of them under Israeli supervision . The total area of these enclaves amounted to about 15 per cent of the territories . The rest was to be controlled by the Israeli settlements and the highways built around the enclaves . The entire area around Jerusalem , from the outskirts of Ramallah to the boundaries of Bethlehem , has already been turned into a `` Greater Jerusalem '' where the Arab- inhabited localities amount to small enclaves surrounded by areas occupied by Israeli settlements or reserved for them . Judging from Labour 's settlement policy , it may be assumed that it may content itself with a lesser number of Arab enclaves of a rather larger size than Sharon had planned . But the principle of surrounding the enclaves by settlements strategically dispersed along the highways remains unchanged . Labour plans only four enclaves in the West Bank : two in `` Samaria '' and two in `` Judea '' ( i.e . north and south of Jerusalem respectively ) , and no more than two in the Gaza Strip . In regard to `` Greater Jerusalem '' , Labour 's policies hardly deviate from Sharon 's . A saner version of Likud policy As some Israeli correspondents at once realised , Labour policies were but a saner version of Sharon 's extravaganza . Last July , Gideon Eshet wrote in Yediot Aharonot that , while `` barely a few months ago '' Labour supported the demand to freeze all construction beyond the Green Line , `` no specific decision to freeze construction in the territories has been taken '' . And Uzi Benziman wrote in Ha'aretz that `` as far as can be judged on the basis of the internal political discussions in Jerusalem , Rabin intends to stick to Likud 's ways '' . The two biggest enclaves envisaged by Labour are located in `` Samaria '' . Therefore the belt of settlements around the `` Trans-Samaria Highway '' , designed to separate those enclaves from each other , is of paramount importance . According to the latest data , the percentage of Israeli settlers in the entire West Bank population ( apart from East Jerusalem ) is a mere 5.5 per cent . But for the area around the `` Trans-Samaria Highway '' , the corresponding figure is almost 20 per cent , and it is increasing steadily . The situation in the settlements of the `` Efrat Block '' south of Jerusalem , designed to sever the enclave around Bethlehem from the one around Hebron , is pretty much the same . The `` Efrat Block '' is now being connected with West Jerusalem by a highway . The project is costly in the extreme , because the highway is designed to bypass Bethlehem by a sequence of long tunnels . The final decision to build this highway was suspended until Rabin 's return from his US visit in March . The subsequent decision to renew its construction can be seen as US approval for the enclaves plan as a whole . Process of impoverishment The enclaves plan implies deliberate and steady impoverishment of the Palestinians . This is well known in Israel but ignored abroad by all who should be concerned , including the PLO . In regard to the Gaza Strip , the whole process was best described by Ze'ev Shiff in Ha'aretz in March . He mentions having seen `` a pamphlet issued six years ago by the Civil Administration forecasting the conditions in the Gaza Strip under Israeli rule in 2000 '' . His analysis deserves to be quoted extensively : '' We continue to steal the Strip 's water , even though its quality deteriorates from year to year . We continue to steal the Strip 's tiny land resources , in order to found there more and more settlements , as if we deliberately want to make the inhabitants despair , and in their despair think in termws of having nothing to lose . It is by our own doing that the Strip 's workers must now spend travelling to their workplaces almost as much time as they spend working . From the military point of view , we have kept control of no more than half the Strip 's area at an increasingly exorbitant price in manpower and resources . About a year before Moshe Arens left the defence ministry , I heard him saying that we should withdraw from the Strip come what may . His argument was that Israel sinks into the Strip ever deeper and deeper . He told me he had proposed this to Yitzhak Shamir but he rejected it . '' Yitzhak Rabin rejects it too . Enormous state support for the Qatif Block settlers can also be cited as proof that the enclaves plan is being implemented . The Qatif Block settlements , founded by the first Rabin government of 1974-77 , are intended to divide the Gaza Strip into two separate enclaves . Efraim Davidi of Davar had data showing how vital for Israeli this enterprise is . `` The Qatif Block is now producing 40 per cent of Israeli tomatoes destined for export , and a substantial proportion of cut flowers . '' He also deals with the subsidies the settlers receive , considerably augmented by the present government . Owing to them , housing units are cheap . The present government does not spare efforts to recruit new settlers to the block . `` Any prospective settler will get a 95 per cent mortgage for his house on top of a grant of 18,000 shekels ( $ 6,500 ) . '' Such data shows that Israel 's plans apply whether the Palestinians of the Gaza Strip are allowed or forbidden to work in Israel . The economic motivations were explained by Danny Rubinstein in Ha'aretz in March : '' From the economic viewpoint Gaza could already be sealed off hermetically and all the Strip 's workers could be barred from entering Israel ... Even though accurate data is hard to come by , it is indisputable that during the last two years the numbes of Gazan workers arriving daily to work in Israel has markedly decreased , from 80,000 in the mid'80s to 40,000 today . But the decrease is not only due to restrictions imposed on entering Israel from Gaza . It is also due to the drastic curtailment of demand for Gazan labour in Israel . With unemployment in Israel soaring and the construction of apartments blocks virtually halted , the workers from Gaza are no longer really needed ... '' Gaza 's total dependence The entire economy of the Gaza Strip is totally dependent on Israel . In recent years in the Gaza Strip there has been an increase in sub-contracted work for Israeli factories , mostly footware and textiles . Thousands of small workshops , employing an average of four workers , get their raw materials or unfinished products , together with detailed working instructions , from Israeli factories . Rubinstein attributes this development to the fact that '' the average wage in the Gaza Strip is merely 40 per cent of that in the West Bank , which in turn stands at half the average wage in Israel ; and besides the Gazan employer does not pay any social security for his employees . '' If the average wage in the Gaza Strip is just a fifth of that in Israel , the profits of Israeli factories and even of Palestinian sub-contractors must be vast . They are higher still when `` a Gazan sub-contractor provides labour to be performed at home , with the family 's help . The livelihood of tens of thousands of Gazans depends on such sub-contracted work . '' Many of them are women and children , paid about ten shekels ( $ 3.50 ) a day which can last 12 hours or more . There can be no doubt that profits from exploiting cheap Gazan labour are one of the reasons for the stubborn opposition of Rabin and other Israeli ministers to withdrawal from the Strip . Economic conditions in the Gaza Strip differ little from what was created straight after Israel 's conquest [ in 1967 ] . In this respect , one should not be deluded by the talk , nowadays fashionable , about Israeli gestures intended to `` encourage economic development in the territories '' , As Israeli journalists point out , all permits for opening new businesses depend on a prior approval by the Shin Bet . `` Behind all the professed goodwill there is no desire to solve problems , just the attitude of a good colonialist , willing to do something for the benefit of the natives , but on condition that they behave nicely , do not become rebellious , and never do anything against the interests of the metropolis , its economic interests included , '' wrote Michal Sela in Davar in February . The development of sub-contracted work in the Gaza Strip accords perfectly with Sela 's diagnosis . Sela also shows how exactly the economic controls work . `` In all branches of the economy , lobbies have been set in motion for purposes of freeing Israeli production from the threat of any Palestinian competition . The method is simplicity itself . As soon as any Israeli producer succeeds in persuading the government , or even the trade and industry minister alone , a military order is issued prohibiting the export of a given produce to Israel . If this does not suffice , a Palestinian factory may be denied a licence to operate or bureaucratic obstacles may paralyse its production . '' Among the most active of such lobbies is the agricultural one . It has succeeded in limiting exports of Gazan vegetables ( except for those grown by settlers ) not only to Israel but also to Europe , where they otherwise might compete with Israeli exports . Perpetuaring apartheid Labour 's goal is to perpetuate this apartheid regime in the territories . The same goal is shared by the US , which otherwise could not support the Labour government so firmly . In my view one of the reasons the US feels happier about supporting Labour than Likud is its greater efficiency in pursuing the settlement drive . This point was brought home by Ofer Shelah in Ma'ariv , who deplored the settlers ' failure which he attributed to Likud 's inefficiency . he showed that the peak yearly settlement growth `` occured during the term of office of the National Unity government ( i.e . 1984-90 ) in which Rabin served throughout as the defence minister '' . Likud 's reputation for settling the territories better than Labour is false , attributable to the many tiny settlements without strategic value founded under Shamir for symbolic reasons . To sum up : Labour 's policy , unconditionally supported by the US differs from that of Likud primarily in the efficiency with which it is implemented . According to that policy the territories are to be divided into two parts . The major part is to be ruled by Israel directly , and the minor part indirectly . In my view , this racist scheme is doomed to ultimately fail , but at a horrifying price in human suffering . The sooner its true nature is recognised , the less suffering it may cause . ************************************

THANK you for playing , but obviously you are not reading the material as it is presented . According to the report I 've got in my hands , the Newsweek article ( which reported that `` 2 to 3 percent '' of the population is gay ) used the criteria of `` No heterosexual contact in the past year . '' But at the same time , the University of Denver study points out , quite dramatically , that 60 % of all self-identifying gay men have > had some form of heterosexual contact in the past year . I think the big mistake in that study must be that if one had had no sexual contact of any kind in the previous year , they are counted as heterosexual . Even if they did n't intend it that way , that 's how the figures are being used .

Your argument tries to paint the BATF critics as right-wing gun nuts , and just mixes up two issues . I am one of the BATF/FBI critics , and yet I am a liberal and just as anti-gun as you are . I just happen to believe that everyone has civil rights , even religious crazies . They 're all human beings , not some nest of wasps that you 're trying to exterminate . The BATF created the crisis situation by the way they handled the original raid . It was well known that Koresh regularly went jogging outside his property . He could have been served with a search warrant then . He could have been arrested if he had refused to comply . Instead officers armed with grenades invaded the property . This escalated into a shooting war with tragic deaths on both sides . Those were the first two mistakes : the bad judgment of asking for a no-knock warrant , and the bad and probably illegal way the already-unwise warrant was served . At this point , the situation escalated to where it was described as an armed standoff and a hostage crisis . That 's when the government started covering their traces , sealing the warrant , revising their reported history of the incident , etc . Things were already building up to disaster . Now the government could have simply closed the supply routes and waited . But according to Janet Reno , that option had `` never been seriously considered '' . So , supposedly because the agents were `` frustrated and fatigued '' , and because there supposedly were no backups , they felt they had to go in . Now it 's entirely possible that Koresh was responsible for the fire . If that 's so , he deserves the blame for the deaths of the people in his compound . But the government 's hands are far from clean . Their first raid demonstrated bad judgment plus contempt for the 4th amendment . The motivations for the second raid are just too unbelievable . And their coverup of the events of the first raid undermines their credibility in anything they do thereafter . We have only some very biased FBI agents ' word for what happened . And please let 's not turn this into a pro-gun vs. anti-gun discussion . Anti-gun people do not believe that gun-owners deserve to get frontally assaulted by armed government agents . And Koresh 's civil rights exist whether his guns were legal , illegal , illegal-but-should-have-been-legal , or whatever ! -- Rob Strom , strom @ watson.ibm.com , ( 914 ) 784-7641 IBM Research , 30 Saw Mill River Road , P.O .

Could n't think of a better place for a rapid answer than comp.sys.mac.hardware . I need to connect the Serial A of a Compac 386/20 PC to the printer port of a Mac IIci . Does anyone have handy the pin-pin routing for the cable that would allow this connection ? The serial port on the Compaq is a MALE DB9 . How would this map to the DIN8 of the Mac serial ? I tried one of those really short femaleDB9-maleDIN8 cables that Apple sold as adaptors to plug in Macintosh serial peripherals from the pre-MacPlus era . This cable did n't do it . Do I need a null modem adaptor as well on the DB9 side of things ? I just need to be able to map the data TX and RX pins correctly . thanks kindly , Atau Tanaka tanaka @ ircam.fr

The concrete floor accelerates the problem because it is a heat sink and a colder lead-acid battery self-discharges at a slightly faster rate . That's why the old wives ' tale of sitting it on a piece of wood on the floor works to help keep from killing the battery as fast -- -- it insulates the battery thermally . It you 'll set the battery down on a piece of styrofoam , it will self-discharge even slower . The best thing would be to attach a small load such as a small transistor radio with the volume turned down low and leave it on constantly , but also trickle-charge it every couple days too to `` shallow- cycle '' the charge in the battery . Such mild `` exercising '' of a lead-acid battery is the next best thing to completely removing the electrolyte for storage . If you do remove the electrolyte , may sure you keep separate storage containers for each cell 's electrolyte and put it back into the same cells when you refill the battery . This is n't so critical for a brand-new battery in a fully charged state , but will maximize the restored output of an older battery which may not be fully charged when you remove the electrolyte for storage . -- ============================================================================= Neal Howard '91 XLH-1200 DoD # 686 CompuTrac , Inc ( Richardson , TX ) doh # 0000001200 |355o33| neal @ cmptrc.lonestar.org Std disclaimer : My opinions are mine , not CompuTrac 's . `` Let us learn to dream , gentlemen , and then perhaps we shall learn the truth .

Infrared astronomy did n't really get started until something like 25 yrs . ago ; it did n't explode until IRAS in 1983 . Gamma-ray ( and I think X-ray ) observations did n't really get started until the '70s . I believe the same is true of ultraviolet observations in general , and I know that extreme UV ( short of 1000 Angstroms ) observations , until the EUVE ( launched last year ) had almost no history except a few observations on Skylab in the '70s . Twenty-five years ago , the vast majority of astronomers only had access to optical or radio instruments . Now , with far more instruments available , growth in some of these new fields has resulted in optical work representing a smaller fraction of total astronomical work . > Seriously , though , you 're never going to get a 10-meter scope into orbit > as cheaply as you can build one on the ground , and with adaptive optics > and a good site , the difference in quality is narrowed quite a bit > anyway . fc > That would be true , if adaptive optics worked well in the visable . fc > But take a look at the papers on the subject : They refer to anything fc > up to 100 microns as `` visable '' .

What would he have to do to please you guys , bat 1.000 ? > You can hardly claim that he is `` hurting his team '' . It would help if his OBP were higher than his batting average . Yes , the April 12 USA Today lists Le Grand Chapeau as having a .422 batting average and a .413 OBP . That 's on 19-for-45 hitting with 0 ( zip , nil , nada ) walks . The reason a lot of us are down on Galarraga is that he 's has a long history of showing that this is nowhere near his real level of ability ( except for drawing walks ) . If he hit .400 for , say , even 250 AB 's I 'd be convinced that there was a real change in his ability . If he did it with an OBP < AVG , I'd not only be amazed but I 'd make a bet that that would be a unique feat in the history of the game . But what do 45 AB 's prove ? Look at some of the other fluke players at this point in the season : Player AVG AB Blauser .367 49 Grace .391 48 Milligan .400 35 Conine .375 40 Lansing .400 50 Slaught .406 32 Are any of these guys really that good ? Well , in a word , no . How significant is Galarraga 's average ? At the 45 AB level , a hit is worth about .020 . If he 'd had one of those hits called an error and one taken away by a good defensive play , he 'd be in the .380 range . If he goes 0-for-4 in his next game he 's all the way down to .388 . In one game . Come back in June . Let's talk then . > If it happens that the pitchers start throwing him fewer good pitches > and he starts making lots of outs ( as someone speculated might happen ) , > *THEN* I would agree with you that he is n't taking enough pitches . My comment > that `` he is n't paid to walk '' does n't mean that he should have a license > to swing at bad pitches and make outs ; it 's more along the lines of : he's > batting .400 and leading the league in RBI 's so what bloody difference > does it make if he is n't drawing a lot of walks ? Sheesh . It 's history , Greg . Andres ' history is that he does n't walk much because he swings at bad pitches , so his average is n't very good . 45 AB 's does n't mean an awful lot compared to a history of a couple of thousand , especially when there 's ample evidence ( 0 BB in 1992 ) that his basic hitting approach hasn't changed . Yeah , he might suddenly have turned into a .400 hitter who never walks , but do n't bet the rent money on it .

'' Months to get ready , unlimited funds , knowledge of a threatened mass suicide by fire , and no fire trucks on hand ? This is `` extreme professionalism and care ? '' I can understand the first screwed-up raid by the BATF . They underestimated the opposition , which happens . But not this one . The FBI had their first team in place , massive resources , ample time for planning and bringing up any specialized equipment or people necessary . They still botched it . The FBI Director and the FBI SAC in overall charge should resign , or be fired for incompetence . I do n't blame Reno or Clinton . They gave the FBI clear orders : do n't go in unless you can do it without casualties ; if you ca n't do that , wait it out . Those were reasonable orders . The FBI said they could pull off a tactical solution , and they could n't . John Nagle

Well , here goes . The first item of business is to establish the importance space life sciences in the whole of scheme of humankind . I mean compared to football and baseball , the average joe schmoe does n't seem interested or even curious about spaceflight . I think that this forum can make a major change in that lack of insight and education . All of us , in our own way , can contribute to a comprehensive document which can be released to the general public around the world . The document would scientifically analyze the technical aspects of long term human habitation in space . I believe that if any long-term space exploration program is to succeed we need to basically learn how to engineer our own microworld ( i.e . the spacecraft ) . Only through the careful analyses of engineering , chemical , biological , and medical factors will a good ecosystem be created to facilitate human life on a long-duration flight . So , I would like to see posts of opinions regarding the most objective methods to analyze the accepted scientific literature for technologies which can be applied to long-duration spaceflight . Such a detailed literature search would be of interest to ourselves as space advocates and clearly important to existing space programs . In essence , we would be dividing the space life science issues into various technical problems which could be solved with various technologies . This database of acceptable solutions to various problems could form the basis of detailed discussions involving people from the bionet , isunet , and any other source ! I 'm eager to hear your comments and see posts on this thread .
From : jbrown @ vax.cns.muskingum.edu Subject : ESPN cares less about hockey Organization : Muskingum College Lines : 23 ESPN is pathetic , I have been watching everybody complain about ESPN 's coverage and I agree with all of you . Might I suggest that we are getting all worked up over nothing . We ALL knew that ESPN 's coverage was going to suck . I mean have you ever watched during the regular season Sportscenter coverage of hockey ? It sucks , I mean really sucks ! ! ! ESPN does not know hockey if it shot them in the ass . I was really pissed of about last night , coverage . I go to school in Ohio I *know* the Indians suck , so why show them ? If I were Bill Clement I would shoot myself . Anyway after I calmed down after I realized that they were not going to show overtime of the Caps Isles game I thought to myself I knew that this was going to happen , in fact I remerbed myself praying that at least they would keep even the boring Devils game . Overall I think ESPN does not care if they show hockey or not and I firmly belive that they have know respect for the fans . ie *because of contract obligations* , screw you ESPN . Praise be to all hockey fans who put up with this shit ! GO HAWKS ! ! ! JB

From : hathaway @ stsci.edu Subject : Re : Vandalizing the sky . Lines : 81 Organization : Space Telescope Science Institute Distribution : na > Newsgroups : sci.astro , sci.space > Subject : Re : Vandalizing the sky . > My apologies if this is a re-post - I submitted it on Friday , but got a message that my post might not have gone out . Considering the confusing spitting contest over 'rights ' , ( there are TOO inalienable rights damn it ! The majority can be just as destructive of liberty as a despot ) , I suspect that my post did not get out of my site . ( I ai n't saying that dark skies are included in these rights , although we can only preserve any rights by exercising them . ) Anyway , here are my thoughts on this : I 'd like to add that some of the `` protests '' do not come from a strictly practical consideration of what pollution levels are acceptable for research activities by professional astronomers . Some of what I would complain about is rooted in aesthetics . Many readers may never have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred - unsullied by the actions of humans . The space between the stars as profoundly black as an abyss can be . With full horizons and a pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time - none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man . Any lights were supplied solely by nature ; uncorruptable by men . Whole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there and becoming immortal as the stars , whether by apotheosis or a belief in an afterlife . The Space Age changed all that . The effect of the first Sputniks and Echo , etc . on this view could only happen once . To see a light crossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people is still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating the scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or thousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe . But there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky . Yes , I know aircraft are almost always in sight . I have to live in a very populated area ( 6 miles from an international airport currently ) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly . The impact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists that has not been shaped , sculpted , modified , trashed or whipped into shape by the hands of man . In some places the only life forms larger than bacteria are humans , cockroaches , and squirrels ( or rats ) . I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains one weekend , `` getting away from it all '' ( paved roads , indoor plumbing , malls , ... ) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed the hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80 miles to the east . ( Their 'security light ' did n't help matters much either . ) But I 've heard the artic wilderness gets lots of high air traffic . So I know the skies are rarely perfect . But there is still this desire to see a place that man has n't fouled in some way . ( I mean they 've been TRYING this forever - like , concerning Tesla 's idea to banish night , - wow ! ) I do n't watch commercial television , but I can imagine just how disgusting beer , truck , or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high . If ya ' got ta make a buck on it ( displaying products in heaven ) , at least consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last beautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life . To be open about this though , I have here my listing of the passage of HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at 8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the local meridian from Baltimore vicinity . I 'll be trying to see it if I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all . So I suppose I could be called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky while complaining about billboards proposed by others . Be that as it may , I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid , even if it ca n't ever be perfectly achieved . Regards , Wm . Hathaway Baltimore MD ( P.S . added Tuesday - this again is not a rights/vs./reality tome , just a warning that someone into destroying beauty had better know that other people may not accept it without a complaint . )

The conditions were wonderful , thanks to our Armenians , who received us . But it 's not relaxing all the same . I do n't know how everyone else feels about it , but for me it 's torture . We do n't have a place to call our own . I had a two bedroom apartment in Sumgait , my children went to school and we lived well , in friendship . It 's painful that in our times , in 1988 , in the Soviet period , people can break into our apartment and try to kill me and my children , in whom I 've put all my efforts and my whole youth . Everything was going well for us : my older daughter was studying at the Institute , the middle one was preparing to enter medical school and was interning as an orderly , and my youngest had been sick for a long time , but had returned to health . I have been though a lot in my life : it 's been seven years since I lost my husband , I raised my children by myself . Lots of women have similar fates , but there 's nothing to be done about it . But I ca n't control myself when I remember what happened in Sumgait on February 27 , 28 , and 29 , it was just a horror , it 's indescribable . On February 27 our relative , Ira , came to visit us . She 's better friends with my oldest daughter , and so right away she asked , `` Where 's Vika ? '' I say , '' Vika 's off in Pirkuli on a trip for three days , she 's supposed to come back tomorrow . '' My middle daughter , Gaya , had baked a cake and we sat there talking and laughing , drinking tea . Then Gaya and Diana went to walk Ira home . They left and a few minutes went by ; suddenly I hear noise . I raced out to the balcony -- our balcony is right across from the bus station , we live at the corner of Mir and Druzhba Streets -- I look and see that there are hoards of people near the bus station and they 're all shouting something . What they're shouting I ca n't understand . Our neighbor is standing on his balcony , too . I ask , `` Nufar , what 's happened ? '' He says , `` I do n't know , I ca n't figure it out either . '' I got scared -- the kids had gone outside , and I wanted to run after them , but then there was a knock at the door . I open the door and it 's the kids . `` Mamma , '' says Gayane , `` you 'll never believe what 's going on out there ! It 's awful ! '' Ira says , `` Aunt Zina , they 're shouting , 'Karabagh ! Karabagh ! Karabagh is ours ! ' We did n't know what was going on . They 're threatening to drive out the Armenians and slaughter them . '' I called my brother , and his wife answered the phone . I said , `` Aunt Tamara , do n't worry , Ira is staying here with us , and we 'll see her home later . '' I could n't shut my eyes all night long , even until morning . I was worried about Vika . My God , what was going on , what had happened ? ! -Gayane : That day , on the 27th , we stood on the balcony and observed what was happening , although Mamma would n't allow us to watch all of it . There were n't 50 yards between our building and the bus station . We could see and hear everything perfectly . They were stopping buses , dragging people out , leading all the passengers out , looking for Armenians . If they found an Armenian on the bus , then it started . . .I do n't know what to call it . . . -Zinaida : It 's called slaughter . -Gayane : The mob would descend on people and beat them . I do n't know if they were killing them or not , but when they left them , they lay still , not moving , as though nothing was left of them . One person was lying there and they started dragging him . The police were standing right there , to the side , not doing anything , they did n't take any steps to calm that mob . It was awful to stand there and watch it all from the balcony . And you could n't go anywhere , somehow . . . you wanted to be able to see everything so as to tell of it later . We wanted to leave Sumgait that day . What kept us was the idea that we live in the Soviet Union , and that something would be done about it . Where in the world was our government ? ! -Zinaida : We could n't leave town , of course , because our older daughter wasn't home . And at the same time I was terrified for Gaya and Diana . On Sunday morning when I went to see Ira home , our neighbor said , `` Zin ' , you know they went into Valodya 's house and smashed everything he had . They murdered his father and two sons . '' Valodya is our neighbor , he 's an Armenian , he lives on the first floor . I think , my God , what is happening ? ! And in broad daylight ! I saw Ira home and when on the way back I came across a mob shouting `` Slay the Armenians ! Karabagh is ours ! '' This was at 12 o'clock in the afternoon . On the way I stopped into a bread store and the saleswoman says , `` They beat our store manager , they thought he was an Armenian and they beat him , but he was an Azerbaijani . '' And I asked , `` Did they kill him ? '' She says , `` No , he 's in serious condition . '' I left there and started to walk home on that same street , but the mob started moving in my direction . I turned off the street and went down the little way that goes toward the Sputnik store . There I met another crowd , but these were n't bandits , these were our people from Sumgait . I was so frightened that I walked without knowing where was going , I could n't feel my legs or the ground under my feet . I was walking and there was a boy standing before my eyes . This was on the 27th , around evening time . He ran under our balcony , and the mob surged toward him shouting , `` He 's an Armenian , get him ! '' He wore a black coat . They grabbed him , that boy , near the bus stop , I saw it . They grabbed him by the legs and struck his head on the asphalt . I made it home but I just could n't calm down . My oldest daughter was in my thoughts . I was thinking , my daughter 's coming home now , they 'll stop her bus and she 'll be gone . There 's no police , no protection , nothing . It 's like they had all died , there 's no one , nothing , no authorities whatsoever . I ca n't even find the words for it ! I look and see an Ikarus arriving . Before going to the bus station they stop near our place , across from the Kosmos movie theater . So this Ikarus stops there and the gang is yelling , the Azerbaijanis are running toward it yelling , `` Armenians out ! '' And I see them take the Armenians and beat them , killing them . I ca n't watch it any more . It was a nightmare . I just could n't watch it . But Gaya was standing there watching it , and I scolded her . She says , `` Mamma , I have to see it , I have to know what 's happening , I have to see it with my own eyes so I can tell our people of it later . So our children will know . '' Gayane : We saw a great deal on the 27th . They caught no less than 20 people before my eyes . I ca n't say for sure if they killed them or not . . . -Zinaida : There were too many people there , the mob was too big . You could n't make anything out . But I saw that boy in the black coat with my own eyes . He was 18 or 19 years old . -Gayane : I think he was older , probably , about 22 . A tall fellow , a big guy , in a coat . He was walking quickly , but when they shouted that he was an Armenian , he tore off running . And the mob went after him . They caught him right under our balcony . I do n't know . I do n't think there could have been much left of him after that . You can imagine what happens when a crowd attacks one person . It was a mob , big , angry , and featureless . You know , there was a similarity in the way they were dressed , mostly they were wearing long black coats . You could n't even tell them apart , they were all wearing black and they all looked alike . -Zinaida : When they picked up that boy and struck him against the asphalt and he cried `` Mamma ! '' I ran into the room . I could n't watch any longer . An awful lot was going on right then , in various places , it was n't only that boy , several people were being beaten up . You could n't see all of it at once , but when that boy cried `` Mamma ! '' I immediately started watching only him . -Gayane : On that first day it went on from about six in the morning until twelve at night . At midnight they dispersed and the police took their place . They were scattered about in all districts . But how can you explain the fact that by morning , when it had already started getting light , around seven o'clock , our police were gone ? The police disappeared and yielded their positions to the bandits . In the morning they started gathering at our inter- section again , at the bus station and at the entrance to downtown . From morning on all the roads and mass transit stops were covered , and by nine o'clock you could n't even see the ground . There were thousands of people in the crowd . Again they began stopping vehicles and checking for Armenians . -Zinaida : They had signals . I realized that when I noticed that they made a cross with their arms , they crossed their arms over their heads . The cross , evidently , meant that the vehicle had Armenians in it . They let the Azerbaijani cars through , and they stopped the Armenian ones and started their pogrom . -Gayane : They stopped a white Zhiguli and asked the driver what his nationality was . He got out and said they were from Baku . `` But what is your nationality ? '' He says Armenian . They immediately start shouting , `` Ermeni , Ermeni ! '' And he says , `` What 's going on ? I 'm coming from Baku . I do n't live in Sumgait . '' `` Does n't matter , who cares if you 're from Baku or Sumgait . '' Anyway the crowd pounced on him and started beating him , and they dragged a woman -- his wife , probably -- out of the car . At this point the police came and took the two and led them away . Then the mob started smashing the car , and then burned it . The flames blazed . . . it was a horrible fire ! Then everyone ran away , they thought the car was going to explode . About 20 minutes later another car comes along , a green Moskvich . They ran up shouting `` Ermeni ! Ermeni ! '' But this time they did n't pull the people out of the car , they didn't beat them . Maybe they burned them along with the car , because no one emerged from the flames . The neighbor boy Vakhit was standing on the balcony too , acquaintances of his walked by below , and he asked them and they said , `` Yes , they burned them along with the car . '' About two hours later a whole wedding procession came by , and there was a doll on the first car . We thought they were Armenians , but the cars started to honk loudly . They were Azerbaijanis , and they were immediately allowed through . -Zinaida : The driver waved his hand as if to say 'get out of the way . ' The whole crowd parted and the procession passed through freely . -Gayane : By the way , at the marriage hall , which is right in the courtyard of our building , there was a wedding that day . The Azerbaijanis were cele- brating and dancing . On the streets there was grief and death , people were being killed , and people were celebrating the whole time . -Zinaida : Before the apartment itself was attacked I asked Gaya to call and find out when the tourist bus was supposed to arrive . She went to her girlfriend 's in the building , she lives in the first entryway , on the third floor . Gaya came back and said , `` Mamma , the bus is supposed to come around eight , after eight . '' You can imagine what I was feeling , how hard it was : Vika knew nothing about what was happening and was coming to meet her death . Then I heard shouting . I raced to the window and see that the belongings of our neighbors from the second entryway are being thrown outdoors . They were thrashing about with the pillows and the feathers were lying like snow . I started to cry . I am walking around the room , crying , wailing : Vika 's not here , what will come of her . . . Gaya , of course , was consoling me : `` Mamma , nothing will happen to her , do n't worry , calm down , she 's in good company , they 'll look out for her . '' Diana : I saw the green car burn . The car was burning when we went out onto the balcony . Gaya pushed me away , telling me to get off the balcony . I left . Then they came up to the balcony and asked if there were any Armenians here . -Zinaida : You 're right , I forgot about that , that was on the 27th . Diana : There 's a small , grassy area in front of our balcony ; there are trees planted there . The mob asked if there were any Armenians in the building . All the neighbors said , no , there are no Armenians here . There were n't a lot of Armenians in our building , but there were n't just a few Armenian families , either . -Gayane : They fell upon the apartments on the 28th . There were terribly many of them . Our courtyard is huge , and it was completely filled with them . -Zinaida : Katusev had made an appearance on television earlier . He said that two people , Azerbaijanis , had been killed in Karabagh . And when he said that . . . you know how bees sound , have you heard how they buzz ? It was like the buzzing of millions of bees . . . and with this buzzing they flew into our courtyard , howling and shouting . I do n't know how to describe it . By this point we were afraid to watch from the balcony , but when I looked out of the bedroom window -- the Znaniye Bookstore is down there , and Armenians live on the second and fourth floors -- I saw their things being thrown out the windows . I realized that they would be upon us any minute . I shouted to Gayane , `` Gaya , hide the gold . '' That 's honestly what I told my child . I grabbed Diana . I did n't know what to do ! Vika still was n't home , and it was already getting dark . I was afraid to look at the time because I was already horrified as it was . -Gayane : Just in case , we changed the television channel from the Moscow station to the Azerbaijani one . -Zinaida : And turned it up loud . -Gayane : We never listened to Azerbaijani music . It just did n't do much for us . In all those years we almost never listened to it . But sometimes we would watch some entertainment show or film on Azerbaijani television . And that was it . And here we had it turned up full blast . So they would think we were Azerbaijanis . -Zinaida : Well you can imagine , they 're slaughtering Armenians , robbing them , and we 're listening to this concert music from Baku . Our Azerbaijani neighbors suggested we do it , they knocked on the door and told Gaya to turn on Azerbaijani music . But we already had it on anyway . Turn on the lights , they told us , so they will think you 're not Armenians . They 're saying the Armenians are afraid to turn on their lights , they 're hiding . -Gayane : Apparently there was some kind of arrangement , because we noticed that the lights were off only in Armenian apartments , that is , the Azerbaijanis were warned , and every last one of them had their lights on . When we turned the lights off two of our neighbors came immediately , and later , another one . `` Turn on the lights , '' they told us , `` please . Nothing will happen . Be calm . Nothing will happen . '' -Zinaida : `` We wo n't allow them to come into your apartment . '' -Gayane : We believed those people . We had never done anything bad to them . -Zinaida : After the whole nightmare , about March 15 , before we left for Armenia , when I was coming into the building they were all crying . The Azerbaijanis were crying , saying , `` Can it be there is no God ? How could they raise their hands against your family ? You never did anyone any harm , you never refused anyone anything , not in hard times , or in time of fortune , or in time of mourning . How could they give you away ? How could they sell you down the river ? '' They really had given us away . Some of them protected us , but others gave us away . They sold us down the river . -Gayane : I was wearing slacks that day , and when it all began I became cautious for some reason and I changed my clothes . Azerbaijani women do n't wear pants . Young Armenian and Russian girls in Sumgait wore pants , but the Azerbaijanis found that very strange . And I thought I better put on a skirt , otherwise they wo n't believe me if I told them we were Azerbaijanis . There was nothing else we could do . No other way out . I was forced to turn myself into God knows who . I let my hair down , tousled it , and threw a scarf over my head . -Zinaida : And she told me , `` Mamma , you hide . Take Diana and go into the other room . You two look more like Armenians . They 'll figure out that we 're Armenians right away . '' But how could I go away and leave her there ? ! -Gayane : I went out onto the balcony . It worked out better that way . We were the only Armenian family in the fourth entryway . This gave us hope : we were the only ones , the neighbors would n't let them in . They , the Azerbaijanis , would fear for themselves and for their children . I looked and saw someone crawling up on the balcony from below , it was easy to get up onto our balcony . When we would lose the keys the neighbors would let up into their places and we would crawl across onto our balcony and get in that way . So I turned around and saw a guy with a knife on our balcony . He looks at me and shouts , `` What nationality are you here ? '' -Zinaida : At the same time they were knocking on the door . -Gayane : `` What nationality are you ? '' he 's shouting . Well at first I was frightened , but then I got control of myself and answered in perfect Azerbaijani , `` You should be ashamed of yourself , asking a question like that . Ca n't you see I 'm an Azerbaijani ? If I were an Armenian would I come out to meet you face to face and look you in the eyes ? '' He looks at me and tells the people with him , `` Yes , Azerbaijanis live here . '' From below they tell him , '' Check it out , it ca n't be , they have to be Armenians . '' And he asks me again , '' What nationality are you ? '' I say , `` Ca n't you see ? '' I started fuming . I could not say anything else . `` You 're blind , that 's for sure ! You can yell all you want , but that wo n't make us Armenians . '' I hear them breaking down our door , and Mamma went toward the door . I say , `` I do n't have time to deal with you , they 're breaking down our door . '' 1 go to the door and ask , `` Who is it ? '' They answer , `` Open up ! '' I say , `` Wait , why are you breaking the door ? What 's going on ? I 'm opening up . '' We never locked the lower lock , it was broken , but now they had locked it out of fear , and I could n't get it open . I say wait , I 'm looking for the key . I opened the door -- it was almost broken down already . I opened the door and they burst in . I say , `` What 's going on ? Why are you breaking down our door ? '' -Zinaida : Then they started climbing in from the balcony . They 're shouting , '' Why do n't you open the door ? '' And I say , `` Well you 've already come in the balcony . '' Then Diana sees their knives , runs into the bathroom , and closes the door . Gaya cries out , `` Mamma , Diana ran into the bathroom ! '' I ran to the door and forgot that we were pretending to be Azerbaijanis , and said in Armenian : '' Diana , open the door ! '' Gaya tried to calm them down , and I 'm shouting with tears in my eyes for Diana to open the door . -Diana I was sitting on the couch with my doll , Little Red Riding Hood . That guy climbed in from the balcony with a big knife with a yellow handle . They put it up to Mamma 's stomach . I ran to the bathroom , opened the door , and slammed it behind me . I was frightened , and started to cry . I shouted , `` Mamma , they want to kill you ! '' And then . . . then they started shouting , `` Give us your passports . '' And Gaya says , `` What do you need passports for , we 're Azerbaijanis . '' -Gayane : I tried to convince them that we were Azerbaijanis , I was trying everything I could , I could get on my knees and plead . I could humble myself , because at that moment I was worried about other lives than just my own . To be honest I did n't care about anything else , as long as my little sister would survive , her life and health had cost us so dearly ! I tell them , `` What , do n't you understand anything ? '' They started shouting , they were tremendously excited , shouting with terribly loud voices , saying that in Stepanakert their girls were being killed , raped , and tossed around with pitchforks . Why should n't they do the same to us ? I said , `` Who 's doing all that ? Who is doing it ? Some Armenians ! What does that have to do with us ? Give me the knife , I'll cut my own face . '' `` Now you calm down , '' they tell me . Zinaida : I told them , `` Why did n't you deal with them there ! There , in Karabakh ? Nothing has happened here , no one has been fighting here , not we with the Armenians , nor they with us . Why did n't you give it right back to them there ? What 've we got to do with this ? '' I got confused . I had been saying that we were Azerbaijanis , but suddenly I started speaking as though I were an Armenian , but they did n't notice . One of them was next to me , with a knife at my breast . And he says to the others , `` What pretty girls . '' He meant Gaya and my 10-year-old Diana . I was terrified . Gaya started assuring them that we were Azerbaijanis . One guy stood in the doorway and gave us bad looks . -Gayane : He demanded the passports . I said , `` Young man , I do n't have my passport here . '' He says , `` Let 's have the passport , we wo n't believe you without your passport . '' And one of them started hurriedly searching for documents . They turned the wardrobe in the other room upside down , took the picture off the wall , and started pulling the clothes off their hooks , yelling and shouting , `` Passport ! Passport ! '' They all started yelling , there was so much noise in the apartment . They were all shouting . My hair stood on end . Suddenly I said , `` Listen , my Papa died , 40 days have n't passed yet , we have a Muslim household , we 're in mourning , you should be ashamed of yourselves , you 've disgraced your honor . '' And then Mamma started to cry . -Zinaida : I started crying : `` My husband died , 40 days have n't yet passed , are n't you ashamed of yourselves ! '' In fact my husband had died seven years earlier , in 1981 . `` We 're in mourning , and you burst in here demanding docu- ments . The documents are at the housing office , I 'm filing for my pension . '' Well it seemed like they believed us . Then one guy said , `` They 're Lezgins . Ca n't you see , there are no men here , only women . Leave . '' Another fellow in the group agreed with him , he also said that we were Lezgins . But a third said , `` No , they 're Armenians . '' Well the other two convinced him , I don t know how , and all the rest of them listened to them too . There were about 50 of them , if not more , all in our three-room apartment , even the entryway was filled . They started leaving . Yes , we 're Lezgins , we 're Lezgins . '' They started leaving , and one of them took our tape recorder with him . And the one who had first called us Lezgins says , `` Leave that , what are you doing ? '' They seemed to obey that guy . -Gayane : He was tall , wearing baggy jeans and a coat . -Zinaida : With a little moustache , I think . -Gayane : No , he did n't have a moustache , he was tall with brown hair , he was n't a bad-looking sort . He did n't have anything in his hands . -Zinaida : He stood at the threshold . -Gayane : Yes , he did n't look like a bad guy , and you know , his face seemed familiar to me . I had seen him somewhere . And more than once . But I ca n't remember where . When he came in I was stupefied , I had a premonition that he would n't be able to remain indifferent . When he said that we were Lezgins and that they should leave , such gladness started to glow inside of me . Hope . They continued to argue on their way out . Some said , `` They 're Armenians all the same . '' And that fellow answered , `` even if they are Armenians , it 's shameful , the father died , they 're mourning , there 's nothing but women in the house , there 's no men . We should stay out of the apartment . '' `` What do you mean , stay out ? We can go in there ! '' And he said , `` No , we should stay out , they 're Lezgins , we 're leaving here . '' The three of them protected us . -Zinaida : No , the two of them . The one in the short coat and the one in the grey suit , who stood at the threshold , about 19 or 20 years old . Well they were all young really . The two of them defended us . -Diana : Three , three ! -Zinaida : Do you remember the third one , Diana ? -Diana : Yes , he was wearing dark clothes . -Gayane : The third one was the one who came back . He wore a long brown coat . -Diana : He wore a long , darkish brown coat , and his hair was dark too . When they left , they told him downstairs that those women were Armenians , and ran back and said that they were going to kill us . -Zinaida : They had all left , and we had started to calm down a little , and I closed the door . And then there is a knock . I told Gaya , `` Take Diana and go into the other room . '' My daughters went into the dining room , and I opened the door . There was a guy there who said , `` Run , hide ! They 're coming to kill you now ! '' We ran up to the third floor . We had some good neighbors up there , Azerbaijanis . I sent the kids and stood there alone , not knowing what to do . I was so far gone . . . Out of a whole room I could n't even think of anything to take . I even forgot to take my work documents ; at the time I had been preparing a report to send to Baku , and the documents were at home . I couldn't see anything . . . I could only see Vika , my older daughter . I sent Gaya and Diana upstairs , and stood there asking that fellow , `` Should I close the door and leave everything like this ? '' He says , `` What do you mean , door ? Get out of here , they 're coming to kill you ! What are you standing there for ? '' And I ran after the children . -Gayane : We barely had time to get up to the third floor when they burst into our apartment and started shouting , `` Where are the Armenians ? '' We were already at the neighbors ' . They had an infant at the time , and the neighbor said , '' Do n't you worry , I 'm not letting anyone in this apartment no matter what . '' -Zinaida : On the third floor there I started asking the folks , our neighbors , to go meet Vika . The bus was due to arrive at eight o'clock . I dissolved in tears , Gaya was soothing me , Diana was next to us , she was crying too , and I'm already thinking that I 've lost my older daughter , but deep in my heart I still believe she 's alive . . . And my tears choked me . I was going out of my mind . But no one could leave the building , the courtyard was packed with people , swarming with them . From the balcony the neighbor in whose apartment we were hiding asked the bandits , `` Where are those Armenians , the ones who were at home ? Where did they make off to ? '' They told him they did n't know . They asked him where he lived . He answered , `` Ca n't you see , on the third floor . '' He asked them specially to divert attention from his own apartment . We heard them taking free reign of our apartment , and they threw our color television off the balcony and it exploded . -Gayane : Mamma was crying the whole time . She fell into a faint and we brought her around and held her back , because the whole time she kept making for the door to go outside , alternately raving and sobbing , shouting , and calling Vika . She did n't notice us , probably because we were next to her . Her thoughts were only on Vika . The neighbors who were hiding us were calming her too , offering tea . -Zinaida : We are very grateful to them . Thanks to them my children and I are alive , well , and unharmed . When they were throwing our belongings out and burning them -- the beds , the pillows , and the chairs -- our neighbor came to us and said , `` How lucky you are that it 's not you standing there naked , but some other woman instead . You 're from our part of the building you lost your husband , you have children , thank God you 're not in her position , we would n't have been able to take it . I do n't know what I would do . '' He of course would n't have done anything , he was just trying to calm us down . In the yard they were torturing our neighbors , fellow Armenians They lived on the fifth floor , in the third entryway . A married couple , Vanya and Nina , and their three children . Their last name is V. They hid their two daughters , and stayed with their son to defend themselves , they even got boiling water ready , and an axe , and held them off for a long time , but the . . . They beat up the husband , dragged the wife outside , and stood her naked next to our burning things ; her husband was lying at her feet on the ground . The crowd shouted , '' Look at the naked Armenian ! '' They were going to throw the poor woman into the fire . The neighbors came out , an Azerbaijani woman threw her a scarf , and she covered herself with it , and the neighbors led her off to their apartment . All the neighbors saw and heard it . . . -Gayane : Mamma would n't allow it but I went to the window and saw her standing there , and they took skewers that had been heated in the fire and stuck them into her body . Our neighbor , who lived in the same entryway as Nina -- she lives with us in the same boarding house now -- saw what they had done , Nina showed her , from her knees up , almost up to her neck , her whole body was covered , riddled , with wounds . -Zinaida : In the morning , during the night of the 29th , rather , after one o'clock , two buses approached the station . I wanted to run out . By then I did n't care any more if I lived or died , but Gayane would n't let me go , and the neighbors said that I would bring disaster to them and they would be slain along with their children . Gaya was crying and said that I forgot about them , my other children , but I could only think of Vika . I imagined her torn to pieces , I 'm a mother , and they 're just children , they do n't understand I would have jumped off the balcony and run to the soldiers for help . I was going to do it but Gayane would n't let me : `` Mamma , please ! Mamma , I beg of you ! '' The neighbors were sleeping and Gayane woke them with her cries . So we held on that way till morning . On the morning of the 29th I told our neighbor I was going to go downstairs to our apartment , maybe Vika was lying there , murdered . He told me he would go himself . He was gone for about five minutes , but it seemed like an eternity to me . He returned and said there was no one there , nothing . I went down too , stole down like a mouse , and slipped in everything was thrown all about . I did n't go to the soldiers because the armored personnel carriers were far away , farther than the bus station . I began looking for the briefcase with my work in it . I was miserable because of my daughter , and at the same time because of my work . My documents were there , my travel papers -- I worked in the transport division -- and my trip sheets . -Gayane : Mamma is a very responsible person , she was always ready to work around the clock to do her job . -Zinaida : I look around and I ca n't find the briefcase . I did n't care about the fact that everything had been stolen out of all three of my rooms , that everything was smashed , and the furniture was broken , I worried about that later , but at first I was concerned about the lost documents . I went into the kitchen . My daughter had hidden some valuables in the gas stove : my ring and my earrings . It was all there . Five minutes passed and Gayane ran in and said , '' Mamma , hurry . '' And Diana came downstairs too . Gayane found her coat among the debris , and Diana found her track shoes , her coat , and some of her dresses . -Diana : Immediately after we got back up to the neighbors they started throwing things around in the apartment under us . They threw a television onto the asphalt , it exploded so violently it sounded like a thunderclap . Then , when Vika was n't there , I would n't eat , and they forced me , but I could n't eat . Because I loved Vika terribly and she and I had always gone to the movies and gone for walks in the park . When we went into our apartment the next day and everything was broken , right away I started looking for my dolls and my books , but I did n't see anything . When we went back upstairs I managed to take two cups from my tea service , and Gaya took Vika 's suit and one of her own dresses . My Italian boots were gone , my brown coat , it was beautiful , there was n't a one of my beautiful dolls , and my giant lion was gone too , the one that had been on top of the television . He was very large and very handsome . I had two satchels , one for first grade and the other for second grade , one was yellow-green with a boy and a girl on it , they 're playing a drum and a violin , and there is a dog sitting there closing its ears , and on the other one were the letters A , B , C , D , E and the numbers 4+5 , two girls and a boy with their mouths open like they are singing . They were beautiful satchels . They were gone too . I had many books , I collected them , they were in the bedside tables . And a boy had given me a little apron and a headband for my birthday , they were n't around either . And I had some big books , fat ones , and they disappeared , only one was left , The Malachite Box . The Adventures of Karlson , Pippi Longstockings , and Fairy Tales of the World were left . All the other books were gone . -Zinaida : I continued searching for my briefcase , and then my supervisor arrived . He had waited for me until nine o'clock , but I did n't appear , and he thought something must have happened , so he came . He 's a Russian , Aleksei Semyonovich Lomakin . Alik Aliyev , the mechanic , came with him . When they saw my wrecked apartment they were just petrified , they could not say a thing . When I saw them I started crying . My Azerbaijani neighbors came in . Some of them were crying , others were helping me pick up . I go on looking for my documents and at the same time put things into the wardrobe . Now that I remember it it 's both funny and painful : How could I have thought that I had returned to my apartment and that everything had gone back to normal ? Incidentally , later , when I went back to the apartment again those things were gone too . And the door was gone . After my supervisor left , in the afternoon , the neighbor said that we should leave , find another refuge . `` I 'm afraid , '' he said , `` that someone saw you come to my apartment , and that they could kill you and us too . My God , where could I go it was daytime and those . . . I do n't even know what to call them , the bandits , those marauders , those jackals , I do n't know what to call them , I ca n't find the words , they were everywhere . Where should I go with two girls ? When I opened the door I had tears in my eyes , and I was terrified . . . And he said , `` Go to Alik 's , he 's an Azerbaijani , too . '' and I say , `` You should have said that earlier , when my supervisor was here with the car , he could have taken us with him . '' Everyone feared for their own lives . What could I do ? I went out into the entryway and stood . And he says , `` any other time I would keep you here a year , or two . But right now , I 'm sorry . . . `` Then another door opened , also on the third floor . I ask the neighbor , `` Tayara , can we hide at your place ? '' She 's an Azerbaijani too . She says , `` What kind of question is that ? Come in ! '' She hid us . There were many people in the courtyard , and Gaya and I hid in the wardrobe , and they put Diana under a mattress , leaving a small opening so the child could breathe . Tayara said that when the bandits left she would let us out , and when they came back she would hide us again . We sat in the wardrobe for about a half hour . Gaya became ill , and I allowed her to get out . My legs fell asleep and felt like cannons . We had n't eaten or drunk anything for so long , since the 27th , when we saw that horror -- and all of it just snapped in me . Tayara 's husband went outside , even though I begged him to stay , saying there should be a man in the house . He said that he 'd be in the courtyard , and if anything happened his wife would signal him . She put her passport and all of their documents on the table so if they suddenly came in she could show them that they were an Azerbaijani family . My girls went to the window -- and what was going on out there ! I feared for my children , that someone would recognize them from the street . Gaya let her hair down and put on a scarf so she would resemble an Azerbaijani , but directly across there was a 9-story building , their windows were right across from us , and I shouted that someone would see her and give us away on the spot . But she kept on looking . -Diana : I watched too . -Zinaida : Downstairs the bandits were fighting with the soldiers . The soldiers did n't shoot , they did n't have orders to . I saw them throwing rocks at the soldiers , they were young boys , 18- and 19-year olds , and they defended themselves . . . I 'm a mother after all , and they were no different from my children . When one of the soldiers fell and his head started bleeding I had to stop looking , l could n't watch anymore . . . I imagined my children in their shoes . . . -Gayane : The troops had assumed their defense that morning and had cordoned off the buildings , and some of the soldiers surrounded the bus station , Block 36 , and our Microdistrict 3 . But they only cordoned them off from the outside . The mob fell upon the soldiers , who started to protect themselves , and the mob surged into the courtyard with the soldiers after it . They caught several Azerbaijanis and started beating them with their clubs . One fell down and they cracked open another 's head . . . -Zinaida : They show Lebanon on television , and the war in Afghanistan -- that 's just what it was like . Like in America , how they attack demonstrations with shields and clubs -- that 's just how it was in our courtyard . -Gayane : Do n't compare it with America , those were peaceful demonstrations , but these ? ! -Zinaida : But how could it happen here and not off somewhere in America ! They attacked the soldiers , hurled stones at them . . . Then I thought , where 's the tear gas that the Americans use to disperse demonstrators ? If they had used gas on those jackals they all would have scattered . -Gayane : They would not have scattered . The soldiers had been there since morning , they did n't bring in fresh troops . They had n't eaten , they were fine standing there for about three hours , but then they got tired . They were n't even allowed to sit down . . . At noon they , the soldiers , attacked them , and then the tables were turned . The mob went after the soldiers , the guys were bunched into a group in the center street and covered themselves with their shields , and the Azerbaijanis surrounded them and threw paving stones at them . And those guys sat there covering themselves with their shields . And meanwhile tanks with machine guns were cruising the streets . . . They always say , `` Our children have never seen war . '' I never even dreamed about it , there was no need to . But then I thought about those people who had lived through a war . It was truly horrible . . . The guys were tired , exhausted , some had had their clubs taken away , others , their shields , they had been beaten , they were covered in blood . . . so many died ! They beat the soldiers with their own clubs and shields . And those guys stood there and could n't defend themselves , they could n't open fire . They could n't even defend themselves , let alone us . It 's comical . . . -Zinaida : What are you saying ? How can it be funny ? -Gayane : No , I did n't mean that : How could something like that happen during our Soviet period ? It 's painfully embarrassing ! And they burned the armored personnel carriers , too . Someone shouted , `` Get away , it 's going to blow ! '' Everyone scattered away , and the armored personnel carrier exploded . The soldiers lost their senses . And when they drove the personnel carrier and the bus at the mob out of rage and fury , they drove right up on the sidewalk . -Zinaida : The bus that had brought the troops . Only the driver was in it . The bus ran over three people straight off , I saw it . And two armored personnel carriers ran over four more . All in one or two minutes . The bus ran over three , one of the carriers ran over two , and the second , two more . Right on our street there 's a dry cleaners and appliance and watch repair places ; one of the armored personnel carriers went that way , and they say it ran over several over there , too . But they ran over seven before our eyes . Then the bus ploughed into a book kiosk . -Gayane : No , that was a flower place . It was a new booth . He drove straight into it . -Zinaida : The driver jumped out and they dragged the vehicle out to the middle of the road and set it on fire . -Gayane : And I also saw the troops put a bunch of Azerbaijanis in a bus and take them in a convoy to Baku . There were many arrests . -Zinaida : Our neighbor , the one who hid us , could n't take it , and he told his wife that we should leave . They were running around in the courtyard looking for the Armenians . They knew that they were hiding with Azerbaijanis , and they were saying that they were going to check the Azerbaijani families . Poor Tayara got scared too , and started to cry ; I pleaded with her , I said that I would remember forever how she saved my children and me , but where could we go ? -Gayane : She did n't make us leave , she said that she would do anything , but she was afraid . -Zinaida : I told Tayara that we would just stay a little longer and that at night we would return to our apartment . Then her husband came back and said that a curfew had been imposed . He says , `` Zina , you owe us a drink . Gorbachev announced a curfew . '' And Bagirov [ First Secretary of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan SSR ] was on television , he said that two people had been killed in Karabagh , but nothing was wrong , automobile windows had been broken , but there had n't been any killings . He kept making statements , and there were Azerbaijani songs and dances . Tayara turned the TV all the way up . When we learned of the curfew we calmed down , but then a crowd ran into the courtyard again , a large one . Our neighbor told them that there had been only one Armenian family here , but they had already killed them all , there was no one left . We hid in the wardrobe again . and they stuck Diana back under the bed . -Gayane : Tayara went down to our apartment to see what was happened there , and found two bandits . They asked her , `` What are you doing here '' Tayara answered , '' I came to take something for myself . '' `` Take all you want , they 're gone now . '' -Zinaida : Yes , she had wanted to get something for us , at least some bedding . She said , `` What are you going to do , empty handed , naked , with three children , nothing remains of your entire apartment . '' In short , we calmed down , and the crowd raced off to the other building , the one across from us . I do n't know what went on there . -Gayane : The curfew had its effect on the gangs , many started to disperse : they were warned that they would open fire on them . The soldiers did n't know the city , they could n't get oriented , they drove up and down the main streets , but did n't go into the courtyards . When we were at the City Party Committee they asked people from Sumgait to go with them and show them the way . -Zinaida : The tanks entered the city on the night of the 29th . -Gayane : No , Mamma , the tanks had been there earlier , but were near the City Party Committee , where the Armenians were . . . After midnight , on March 1 , when I had finally gotten to sleep after two sleepless nights , Mamma said , '' Get your things together , they have sent buses for us . '' As it was we had been dressed the entire time . Mamma went to check it out . . .and came back for us . -Zinaida : When I came back for the children Tayara said that Vika was alive and well , some guys had come and told her that they had hidden her in a safe place . I both believed it and did n't believe it . We ran out to the tanks . The Gambarians were there , Roman and Sasha ; their father , Shurik , the clarinetist , was killed , and their mother was there . Sasha came over and asked about the girls . I was surprised , how did he know my girls ? He said that he knew me and the girls . Our neighbor himself went for Gaya and Diana and it seemed like he was taking forever so I went after him . Another neighbor came out , Anna Vasilyevna , a Russian : `` Zinochka , my dear , goodbye and good luck . '' She kissed Diana . They put us in the bus and the captain gave the order for us to be taken to the City Party Committee . The bus would n't start , so they put us on another one . It was pouring rain . -Diana : When they imposed the curfew there were many soldiers on the streets , and they all had clubs and shields . And when the Azerbaijanis attacked them , many of the soldiers died . They threw paving stones -- huge rocks -- at the soldiers . I saw this myself . The soldiers ran over those Azerbaijanis with the tanks . The soldiers saw that the Azerbaijanis were doing violence to people and they ran over them out of rage . We got scared and they hid me under a mattress and a blanket , and Gaya and Mamma crawled into the wardrobe . And they were fighting right down there on the street . . . Near the building they were blowing up buses and tanks , and cars were burning , and there were many dead in the courtyard . They drove without looking to see if it was a sidewalk or a street , they just drove , and the ones who did n't manage to get out of the way were run over by the tanks . And when we left -- it was evening , it was already dark -- there were three buses , and one of them had soldiers in it . Mamma ran up and said , `` Get your clothes on , let 's go . '' Gaya was wearing slippers , and I had on my blue dress , but it was an old one . I was wearing my old jacket , my old dress , and slippers . And nothing else . Gaya had on a skirt , her Angora sweater , and slippers . It was raining hard , and there were puddles on the street . They gave Mamma an old coat because she was wearing a short-sleeved dress ; she put it on and we ran out . We got onto the bus and I was hungry , one of the soldiers from Yerevan gave me rations and carried me from one bus to the other in his arms . I gave him the little glass that remained from Vika's trousseau , and he gave me his telephone number . -Gayane : In the bus there was a soldier with a shield sitting at every window . We had to be ready for anything . They took us to the City Party Committee , let us out , and then took us into the City Party Committee building under armed guard . It was jammed with people and you could n't breathe . We asked , `` Are these all us ? Armenians ? '' They answered yes . We were surprised that there were so many Armenians in Sumgait . All those years we lived there and did n't know there were so many Armenians , 18,000 . We were struck by that , we had never noticed . Going downstairs the next day I ran into the Secretary of the Komsomol from Vika 's plant , the Khimprom . He said that Vika was alive and well . When I told Mamma she of course calmed down some more . But you know , after all that it was hard to believe anything , our faith in everything was just gone . She did n't believe it completely . -Zinaida : I did n't believe it because I had heard all kinds of things . When we arrived at the City Party Committee we heard everything imaginable ! It was the fear of God . I saw many of our acquaintances , they were kissing each other and asking how their children and homes were . Many people already knew that there had been a pogrom of our apartment . They had seen the broken windows . I cried , saying that I did n't know where Vika was . One woman said that they had taken two of her daughters and that she could n't find one of them ; the other had been slashed all over . A second said that her husband and her son had been murdered . That was Nelli Aramian . She lived in Building 6 in our microdistrict . They killed her husband , Armo , and her son Artur . I heard so many things like that that I was already starting to lose touch ; my patience had run dry waiting for my daughter . Later an Azerbaijani fellow came to me and said , Aunt Zina , Vika sent me , she 's alive and well and hidden in a safe place ; if you want I 'll call her there and you can speak with her . We went downstairs to the first floor and he called Vika . I spoke with her , heard the voice of my child . She had managed to survive in that hell . Then I started begging that Azerbaijani to bring her to the City Party Committee . He tried to talk me out of it : `` I 'll bring her wherever you go , do n't worry , I 've looked after her better than a brother does a sister . '' All the same I asked him to get her . He brought her and I calmed down . On the second day there was a meeting with Demichev [ Member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the USSR , ] and people started shouting . One shouted , `` Give me my son back ! `` , another yelled , `` Where is my daughter ? ! `` , a third wanted her husband . . . Bagirov was there too , and he stood there blinking , not saying anything . -Gayane : When Demichev asked where we wanted to go , everyone shouted , `` To Russia ! '' To be honest we were all frightened of Armenia , there were such wild rumors it was as though we were in a terrible dream , and no one wanted to go to Armenia . But he said that he could n't evacuate 18,000 people to Russia and that he would meet with everyone individually the next day and speak with them . And he also said that today he was going to go look at all of our apartments . On March 3 we went to the military barracks in the village of Nasosny . We were taken care of marvelously by the military . They sent special flights of children right from there to Minvody , Yerevan , and Moscow . One woman left for Moscow with a letter for Gorbachev and Gromyko . -Zinaida : The worst was truly behind us by then . Everything had passed , but the pain will remain for our whole lives . It can not be forgotten . Under no circumstances should we , our children , or our grandchildren forget . Who will answer for those who died ? For our mothers , sisters , brother , sons and daughters ? Who will bear the responsibility ? Who will wash away their blood ? Someone should be made to answer , and severely , so it has an effect on the people that did with us as they pleased . . . It is n't over yet , now we live here , in Armenia , protected , but the issue is n't resolved . We would like to stay in Armenia , in our homeland , so that all the Armenian people will be united . Then we will be invincible . Armenians wo n't be scattered throughout the Soviet Union , about the world , and if we 're all together this wo n't happen again . As a mother of three children , as a woman , as a sister , I ask Armenians to be united so that what happened in Sumgait will never happen again . Our homeland . . . The only request we have is that we be helped in obtaining an apartment and getting jobs . So that our children can work for the good of Armenia . If we are n't able to , then let our children do it . And if it 's possible , we 'll work for the good of Armenia too . This is the land of our forefathers . Our grandfathers and great-grandfathers lived here too , it was only later that people dispersed all over . Like a mother , the land here bore and reared us . It is our wife , and will protect us , too . I want but one thing : that our people never see the hardship that our children saw , that your children here , in Armenia , never see anything like it .

From : daniels @ math.ufl.edu ( TV 's Big Dealer ) Subject : Re : Deuterocanonicals , esp . Sirach Organization : University of Florida 's College of Liberal Arts and Sciences Lines : 35 What we call today the `` Old Testament '' was being written up to approx- imately 168 BCE , according to most modern scholars . Aside from the book of Daniel , the whole OT predates Alexander ( the Great ) . These books were written ( predominantly ) in Hebrew . There were also other books being written at about this time and later by Greek-speaking , or `` Hellenistic '' , Jews . These books are those which are reckoned by many denominations as `` Apocrypha '' . Before the closing of the Writings , the third part of what is today called the canon , all of the books were in use by Jews of the day . However , there were those who reckoned ( based on Zech . 13 ) that prophecy had ceased . This faction maintained that there were no true prophets in their day . They also maintained that literature of a prophetic character could not be genuine teachings from God . By the time of c.65 CE , another faction had entered the mess . Christians had come in claiming that THEIR writings were also suitable to be read in synagogues and used for worship . Therefore , the Palestinian Jewish leaders got together and stated that the books written from the time of Ben Sira ( Sirach ) onward were not sacred writings . They justified this from Zech . 13 . In particular , they said , the writings of the Christians ( called heretics ) were not inspired . At about 90 CE , they codified things further by closing the canon in somewhat of an official sense at the Council of Jamnia . A few books ( Ecclesi- astes , Song of Songs , Esther ) made it in after that date , but these were those which had been written prior to the official cut off point ( the time of Ben Sira ) for inclusion that they had established in order to keep out the Christian and Hellenistic writings . Jerome excluded the 'apocrypha ' because they were not in use by Jews of his day and because they were ( except for Sirach ) not found in Hebrew in his time . His criterion for separating them from the other pre-Christian writings was not based on 'inspiration ' . There is plenty more to say , but I do not have time . The passage you quote concerns the book ( Rev . ) in which it is found . Frank D .

Does anyone know anything about this problem ... ... .. - I am using an XmTextField , and setting its XmNvalue to a hardcoded text string ( ascii or Kanji ) either via XtSetValues or XmTextSetString . The problem is that when the XmTextField is displayed , the text is getting truncated , depending on the setting of the environment variables LANG ( more specifically LC_ALL ) . When they are set to japanese , the text gets truncated . When they are set to english , everything works fine . I am taking the default for XmNcolumns . ( Please note that hardcoding of text is NOT done in my actual application , just in my sample code to make things easier ) - I am running Motif 1.2 , X11R5 via HPUX9.01 . My test program is set up to handle 16 bit Kanji characters . I have remembered to do XtSetLanguageProc ( ) prior to my MrmInitialize and my font resources are set to japanese fonts . - Do n't know if this matters , but my dialog box and TextField is initially created with UIL . The problem does NOT happen with XmText . Unfortunately substituting XmTextFields with XmTexts in my application is not an acceptable alternative ( way too much code to be modified while in beta ! ) I have a small test program which illustrates the problem if anyone wants it . My best guess is that either the X code or Motif is not properly allocating memory for japanese , but since I do n't have the source to look at it is just a guess . Please let me know if this sounds familiar , or if you have a suggestion , or if you want the sample program . THANKS ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! - Susan swalker @ bbn.com 617-873-8190

Well , your idea of `` interesting '' differs from mine . I think batting practice is interesting , for example , and make a special effort to get to the game very early in order to see it . I think the delaying tactics of batters , pitchers , catchers , and managers are interesting because they 're attempts to gain advantage through control of the flow and timing of the game . Of course , the umpires can , and should , intervene when these tactics get out of hand . As Ryan Robbins has pointed out , there are rules that cover this . One of the more fascinating things about baseball , I think , is its open-endedness with regard to time . You never know if the game is going to zip right by and be over in less than two hours , or if it 's going to go on until four in the morning . Likewise , some games are action-packed , and some games are slow and lazy . That 's fine by me . Those folks who want constant action should watch the games on TV so they can channel- surf and cater to their short attention spans . Heather HHENDERSON @ vax.clarku.edu

The Cd is related to the drag force which is what effects top speed and fuel consumption . When the drag force on the car or aircraft is greater than what the vehicle 's engine can overcome it has reached its top speed . ( autos of course also have to overcome rolling resistance ) Since drag opposes the vehicle 's motion , the engine must make up for that by burning more fuel . Anyway , since the geometery of an auto is rather complex , the Drag , pressure coeffiecent , etc is either found experimentaly , or using a numerical method . anyway for flow around a cylinder the drag coeff is : Cd = d/ ( q*2R ) where d is the drag force , q the flow velocity and R is the radius of the clyinder . To get a rough ( very rough ) estimate , you can set R at 1/2 the car's width , q at the car 's speed and knowing the Cd , find the drag force that the car would need to overcome . -Bp

Playing in the cavern at Albany ( AA ) last year ( 375/410/385 down the alleys and to center ) , Davis went .285/.355/.483 with 22 homers .

They still have him on the roster ( 16 AB through the first two weeks ) . They 've just never figured out what to do with him .

Or something or other . I do n't pretend to understand > statistical analysis . > Well , we agree on the last part . : - ) One of the basic things you need to have in a statistic to be able to predict a player 's performance on it in the future is for there to be a correlation from year to year . A player 's batting average is correlated fairly well from year to year . A player 's ability to walk or infielder 's Defensive Average are correlated better . That is to say , given their past performance in those statistics we can have a pretty good handle on how they 'll do next year . Put in some simple information about aging and you can do even better . One of the basic problems with something like `` clutch '' batting average - overall batting average is that the correlation from year to year is almost zero . Adding to the sample size does n't seem to help much . As a counterexample to what you showed , consider the following two players from 1984-1987 : Non-Clutch Clutch AB H BA AB H BA Maldonado 1060 260 .245 254 78 .307 Lemon 1643 457 .278 256 57 .223 If you had had these two players in 1988 , by your logic , in those `` clutch '' situations , you 'd bat Maldonado for Lemon in a blink of an eye . Well , in 1988 , Maldonado hit .267 in `` non-clutch '' and .190 in `` clutch '' , while Lemon hit .254 in `` non-clutch '' and .313 in `` clutch '' . Before you accuse me of completely cooking the data , there were 96 players who had 25+ `` clutch '' at bats every year from 1984-1988 ( according to Elias ) . As a simple measure of clutchness , let 's just look at clutch BA-non-clutch BA . If you use '84-'87 to predict '88 for those 96 players , you 'd find that 27 of the 96 were below league average in that measure both in '84-87 and in '88 , 26 were above league average in both periods and the other 43 were above in one and below in the other . If you were just flipping coins , you 'd expect to get 24 above/below in both and 48 that switched . The difference between the observed results and the coin flip experiment is not statisically significant . BTW , correlating players ' _overall_ batting average from '84-'87 with '88 gives a correlation coefficient of 0.59 , which is significant at something better than the 99.9 % confidence level . Correlating their ( clutch-non-clutch BA ) for the same period gives a correlation of 0.088 , significant at no level of any interest . > > > > Everyone would agree ( I hope ) that a grand > > slam in the bottom of the ninth when your team is down by three > > is a VERY clutch hit .

I am making asumptions that life and a similar atmosphere evolve given a range of physical aspects of the planet . The question is what physical aspects simply disallow earth like conditions . eg Temperature range of 280K to 315K ( where temp is purely dependant on dist from the sun and the suns temperature.. ) Atmospheric presure ? - I know nothing of human tolerance Planetary Mass ? - again gravity at surface is important , how much can human bodies take day after day . Also how does the mass effect atmosphere . I thinking of planets between .3 and 3 times mass of the earth . I suppose density should be important as well . Climate etc does not concern me , nor does axial tilt etc etc . Just the above three factors and how they relate to one another .

I did n't want to take it in to be repaired before I asked on the net about this because I already know what they 'll say : `` Yep , you got ta have this replaced and it 's gon na cost you $ ? ? ? .

Geico has purchased radar guns in several states , I know they have done it here in CT . I have also heard horror stories about people that have been insured by Geico for years and then had 1 accident and were immediately dropped . And once you 've been dropped by any insruance company you become labled a high risk , and end up forking out 3 or 4 times what you should be for insurance . My suggestion , stay where you are , or shop around but STAY AWAY from Geico ! Jeff

From : Mail.Server @ mozart.cc.iup.edu ( mserv ) Subject : Ten Commandments or Ten Discourses ? Lines : 135 In the course of discussing the Sabbath with some folks , I came across something that was completely new to me , and I thought I 'd offer it for comment . To keep this as brief as possible , let me state my observation as a declarative statement , and then whoever wants to can comment on it . Basically , what I think I 've observed is that the phrase `` the Ten Commandments '' , as used by Moses , is not a reference to Ex . 20:1-17 , but rather a reference to ten distinct discourses from Ex . 20:1 through Ex . 31:18 . That is , the phrase `` the Ten Commandments '' should more accurately be translated `` the Ten Discourses '' , of which the passage we call the `` Ten Commandments '' is really only the first . I 'm not completely convinced that the above is true , but for purposes of discussion , let me argue it as though I was sure . Arguments supporting the above idea : 1 ) There are n't really ten commandments in Ex . 20:1-17 . In order to get 10 commandments , you have to get two of them out of verses 3-6 , and the verses themselves do not support such a division because they are all about not worshipping other gods . That is , verse 3 commands to have no other gods , and verse 5 commands to not worship the idols mentioned in verse 4 . You ca n't violate verses 5-6 without violating verse 3 , indicating that the whole passage is one command , and leaving us with only Nine `` Commandments '' . I could go on at length about this , but for now I 'll just stop with this summary . 2 ) There ARE ten speeches between Ex 20:1 ( the beginning of the traditional `` Ten Commandments '' ) and Ex 31:18 ( where God actually gives Moses the two tablets with the Ten Commandments/Discourses written on them ) . I break these ten down as follows : 20:1-17 ; 20:22-26 ; 21:1-23:33 ; 25:1-30:10 ; 30:11-16 ; 30:17-21 ; 30:22-33 ; 30:34-38 ; 31:1-11 ; and 31:12-18 . In most cases , each of these passages begins with some variation of the phrase , `` And the LORD spoke to Moses , saying ... '' The exception is Ex . 21:1 , which begins `` Now these are the ordinances which you are to set before them ... '' 3 ) The word translated `` commandments '' in the phrase '' the Ten Commandments '' is n't really the word for '' commandment '' , its the word for a speech , or an utterance . It 's a word often used for longer discourses rather than individual statements ; for instance , when combined with the word 'yom ' ( day ) , this word is translated `` Chronicles '' in such phrases as `` now the rest of the acts of so-and-so , are they not written in the Chronicles of x ? ... '' The word for `` commandment '' is freely used throughout the books of Moses , and perhaps it is significant that when Moses spoke of the Ten X 's , he appears to have avoided the word for commandment and chosen instead a word associated with discourses longer than just a single command . 4 ) God tells Moses that He is going to give him the stone tablets `` with the law and the commandments '' ( Ex 24:12 ) , yet He does not give Moses the tablets until He has finished all ten discourses on Mount Sinai . If the Ten Commandments were only Ex . 20:1-17 , it is not immediately clear why God would wait several days and nine more discourses before giving these tablets to Moses . On the other hand , if we have the Ten Discourses written on the tablets , then it makes perfect sense that God would not give Moses the tablets until He had finished delivering all Ten Discourses . 5 ) When Moses did get the tablets , he found that both tablets were written on both sides ( Ex . 32:15 ) . If these Ten `` Commandments '' were only the first 17 verses of Ex . 20 , God would have had to have written in LARGE letters ! Not that He could n't have , of course , but it does seem more likely to me that this is a reference to two tablets containing ten discourses written in normal- sized letters . 6 ) In II Cor . 3 , Paul seems to specifically single out the `` commandments written on stone '' as being the '' ministry of death '' , `` that which is fading away , '' and '' the ministry of condemnation . '' With the possible exception of the commandment about the Sabbath , it is difficult to see why Paul would refer to the commands in Ex . 20:1-17 as being temporary , `` fading away '' -type commandments . This is less of a problem if the stone tablets should happen to have included all of the commandments from Ex 20 through Ex 31 . Arguments against this idea : The main argument against this idea , aside from the fact that it contradicts a long-standing tradition , is that in Dt 5:22 , Moses says , after quoting the commands in Ex . 20:1-17 , `` These words the LORD spoke ... and He added no more . And He wrote them on two tablets of stone and gave them to me . '' This appears to identify the words just quoted as being the only contents of the two stone tablets . That was my first impression , anyway . However , after some thought , I noted that a great deal hinges on how you understand the phrase `` These words . '' If Moses meant '' These words *which I have just related to you* were spoken by God '' etc. , then that would mean that only the traditional `` Ten Commandments '' were on the stone tablets . If , however , Moses was making a parenthetical comment -- '' These words *which I AM NOW telling you* were spoken by God '' etc. -- then that 's quite different . I did note that in the Dt 5 account , Moses tells of being given the stone tablets BEFORE telling of the people asking Moses to represent them before God , whereas in the Exodus account , the people asked this of Moses between the first and second discourses , several days BEFORE God gave Moses the stone tablets . This reinforces the idea that Moses ' remarks in Dt 5:22ff were intended as a parenthetical remark , rather than a strictly chronological account of when God wrote what , and at what point He stopped adding to what was on the tablets . Summary : all things considered , I find it somewhat more likely that the nine commands in Ex 20 are really only the first of what Moses regarded as the Ten Discourses of God . I do n't know if anybody has ever espoused this idea before ; it 's brand-new to me . So , while I lean towards accepting it , I would be very interested in hearing any comments and criticisms anyone may care to offer . - Mark

Keywords : wasp Organization : Lysator ACS at Linkoping University Lines : 43 ( This is a cross post to rec.gardens and sci.med . Set the follow-up ( line in the header , depending on what kind of advice you give , or ( e-mail directly to me : ceci @ lysator.liu.se . ) I have a problem with wasps -- they seem to love me . Last summer I could n't spend more than ten to fifteen minutes at a time in my garden before one or several wasps would come for me . I am asking for advice on how to repel wasps . This year the wasps have built their nest under a stone next to one of my tiny ponds . The caretaker ( poor fellow ! ) will have to take care of them , and that will give me a head start on them . Last year we could n't find any nest . Even after the caretaker has gassed the nest in my tiny garden of 30 square meter , other wasps will most likely vie for the territory . Is there anything I can grow , rub on my skin or spread on the soil that will repel the black and yellow bastards ? Never mind if it turns my skin purple or kills off all my beloved plants , I want to be able to spend time in my garden like everyone else . Would it help to remove the ponds and the bird bath ? The wasps seem to come to drink at them , and I suppose that their prey will breed in them . The black tits seem to be afraid of the wasps , because as soon as the wasp season starts , they stop coming to have their bath . Even when I am not trying to win back my patio from 15-20 wasps , they seem to love me . The advice I usually get when I ask what to do about wasps , is to stand still and not wave my arms . I 've got some painful stings when trying to follow that advice . I have also tried to use hygienic products without perfumes , to no avail . They still love me , and come for me , even when I 'm in the middle of a crowd . So far only two things seem to work : To kill it dead or to run into the house and close all doors and windows . NB : I do n't have a problem with bees or bumble-bees , just wasps .

Please , if you use my previous writings as contradicting argument , please do read them -- you have not saw them at all ; you just refered to text from which I wrote 'something ' -- and you make hard decisions from that , without reading what exactly I have written . It is really hard read when one writes a reply line by line method and do n't understand include previously written material with the new sentences to give them meaning . You seem to be one such . You also start replying to my articles , even you do n't understand what is going on ; you ask me repeatedly to decsribe my views what were wrong with XV 2.21 even I posted them within the article you did reply to . Believe me , it is not nice to get flamed specially when I know that you have not read my article carefully in the first place . XV-3.00 and JPEG FAQ and users I have written to agree me with the places you did n't ; I 'm sure you just did n't undertand what about I wrote .

'' . I ca n't see what you are objecting to : someone is saying what historians of all beliefs would agree on , and you are calling him a closed-minded bigot ? You really ought to say what you mean by `` belief in Jesus Christ '' . It is not a wording that is sufficient to describe a Christian . Muslims believe in Jesus Christ although they believe he was a prophet and not the incarnated Son of God . But followers of Eastern religions might be quite happy to say that Jesus was the incarnation of God - along with large numbers of other historical and mythical figures . So perhaps you ought to rephrase your question and say precisely what it is in the traditional definitions of what it is to be a Christian , as handed down by the Universal Church , you object to but regard as unnecessary for being a Christian .

I was especially pleased by a very strong game from Linden - I think he could be a key to success for them this year . Defensively , they really had a strong game . Hardly heard Selanne 's name all night . Craven also played one of his best games since coming over . With a few exceptions , they really did n't let the high-flying Jets do much high-flying .

From : Rick_Granberry @ pts.mot.com ( Rick Granberry ) Subject : Re : FAQ essay on homosexuality Lines : 62 Before you finalize your file in the FAQs ( or after ) , you might want to correct the typo in the following : > Kinsey ( see below ) is the source > of the figure 10 percent . He defines sexuality by behavior , not by > orientation , and ranked all persons on a scale from Zero ( completely > heterosexual ) to 6 ( completely heterosexual ) . It seems one or the other end of the rating scale should be identified with '' homosexual '' . As a personal note , I guess I differ with you on the question of work entering human life as a result of sin . > Note that in the > creation story work enters human life as a result of sin . Before the fall ( Gen 2:15 ) `` And the LORD God took the man , and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it . '' which I would call `` work '' . For me , the difference introduced by sin is the painful aspects of work added at the fall ( I take the cursing of the ground in vs.17-19 to apply to the work for sustenance ) . In a way , some view `` work '' as a blessing ( Ecclesiastes is a fun book ! - for melancholies ) . I hope I do not sound caustic , maybe you can enlighten me further . Well , this is certainly a delicate subject , and I guess you accomplished what you state as your purpose `` It summarizes arguments for allowing Christian homosexuality '' , not for me the most noble goal , but you are writing a FAQ . I wonder if you might temporize the apparent `` sentence '' of the specific homosexual you propose ( arguably tenuously define ) . > The danger in advising Christians to > depend upon such a change is clear : When `` conversion '' does n't happen , > which is almost always , the people are often left in despair , feeling > excluded from a Church that has nothing more to say but a requirement > of life-long celibacy . Perhaps that would be true of `` celibacy from homosexual relations '' , or refrainng from their choice relationships , but that does not forbid heterosexual . Could they not have/enjoy heterosexual relations `` for what it was worth '' ? [ This depends upon the person . In some cases I think the answer is no . Even with those who could , consider what you 're asking . I assume we 're talking about marriage -- I certainly would not want to suggest sex outside that . You 're talking about a permanent commitment to a kind of sexual relationship that they are n't really sure they can live with . There may be people for whom this is a possible solution , but I wonder whether it 's entirely fair to the other partner . I have a cousin who was a victim of exactly this situation . We found out later ( after her death ) that her husband had had problems with his sexual identity . His family ( conservative Christians ) knew it , and pushed him into getting married . He continued having problems , and they were near divorce . She died in an accident whose circumstances some of the relatives consider odd . He has since had a sex change operation , and has been moving around from state to state without being able to hold a job , keeping their children in a kind of home life both sets of grandparents consider irresponsible . I hope you can understand why I am not enthusiastic about pushing homosexuals into marriage . I really liked my cousin . This is sort of an emotional issue for me . Again , it may be possible for some , but this is the sort of situation that needs to be dealt with pastorally and not as a matter of fixed ideology . -- clh ]

There is no doubt that Israeli authorities ordered the destruction of mosques in the vicinity of the Wailing Wall . That does not mean , however , that once can generalize from this to any other points . The entire plaza , mosques and all , was cleared to make it possible for Jews to have a place to worship in the place that was holiest to many of them , and which had been denied to them for millenia . On the other hand , throughout the rest of Jerusalem and Israel , to the best of my knowledge , Israeli authorities have scrupulously avoided damage to any Islamic religious sites . This contrasts with the policies of previous regimes which destroyed Jewish synagogues out of hate and bigotry . -- ________________________________________ Jack F.

I would think of the reboost as a gentile push , where a landing , then launch as two JOLTS which would put more mechanical stress on the instruments . Additionally , there might be a concern about landing loads to the shuttle in the event of a laden landing . Finally , probably some thought went into possible contamination problems if the instruments came back to earth . Of course , the cost of two shuttle launches _is_ a good reason to avoid something that might be done in one shuttle launch . Here 's hoping Cepi 's gang gets the job done right the first time .

It clearly points out a possible solution to transcendental values . What I do n't understand is that it also clearly shows the existentialism system where any leap to any transcendental direction is equal . In other words I might not jump off the cliff mentioned above , but at the same time I will decide to what direction I will go . Actually I will do it just now .

The exhibition presents the untold story of the Vatican Library as the intellectual driving force behind the emergence of Rome as a political and scholarly superpower during the Renaissance . The exhibit will be on display in the Jefferson Building of the Library of Congress from January 8 , 1993 through April 30 , 1993 . The online exhibit will be available by anonymous FTP indefinitely .

Each section consists of its own sub-directory within the /exhibit directory and contains the exhibit text for that section and separate JPEG image files for each object . This online exhibit includes not only objects from the Library of Congress exhibit , but also the alternate objects ( brought from Rome to be used if there were a problem with one of the primary objects ) and items omitted later in the planning process . This exhibit will be of interest to Medieval and Renaissance scholars in particular , but also to art historians , historians of science or medicine , early music scholars , students of the humanist movement , students of printing and the printed word , theologians , scholars of both Far and Near Eastern studies , and to librarians and information professionals .

From : lightwave-admin @ bobsbox.rent.com ( LightWave 3D Mail List Administrator ) Subject : Monthly LightWave mailing list FAQ Lines : 130 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- LightWave3D Mail-List -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- WHAT IS LightWave ? -- LightWave3D is part of a suite of programs that come bundled with a device called the `` Toaster '' ( from NewTek , Inc. ) that operates on an Amiga platform . The LightWave software ( LightWave=LightWave3D and LightWave Modeler ) allows and artist to create three dimensional photo-realistic images for a variety of purposes . -- WHY ARE WE DOING THIS ? -- This mailing list is for those interested in the LightWave software , how it operates and in ideas on how to obtain the best quality images available to them . The list is for those who own the Toaster and LightWave as well as those just interested in what can be done with the package . We hope to share information , tips , procedures and to bond as a group . -- WHAT ARE THE RULES ? -- Since LightWave/Modeler are just a part of the Newtek Video Toaster software , I 'm sure we will discuss a few items related to the operation of the Toaster . However , we will strive to keep the subject revolving specifically around the 3D software , related tools and products . You do NOT have to own a Toaster to join this list ! -- OK ! HOW DO I JOIN ? -- To become a member of the LightWave3D mailing list you must send a mail message to the address : lightwave-request @ bobsbox.rent.com In the body of the message enter : subscribe lightwave-l your.name @ your.site.domain Or just ask to be signed up and I will sign you up to the list . At this point in time the process is manual but I hope to get an automated script based system in place soon . There should n't be too much of a delay in joining . Expect a `` welcome '' message within 5 days after you send your request . Then , expect the mail to start flowing in ! -- HOW DO I POST TO THE LIST ? -- Contributing to the list is simple . Just mail your articles to the following address : lightwave @ bobsbox.rent.com Your article will be processed by the system and distributed to all others joined to the list . Your articles will also be sent to you so you know that your article has made it to the list . However , those addresses that are either no good or no longer active will bounce back to you . So , if you post an article and another members address is no longer valid , your original article will be returned to you . This does n't mean it has n't been posted to the list . In fact , just the opposite is true . It means that your article WAS posted and that it could n't be sent to one or more of the members of the list due to a bad address . NOTE : I hope to have a fix for this behavior soon . -- HOW DO I QUIT THE LIST ? -- Simply mail a request to be removed from the list to the same address you used to sign up : lightwave-request @ bobsbox.rent.com In the body of the message enter : unsubscribe LightWave-l your.name @ your.site.domain I will remove your name from the list of members . PLEASE , if you join the list and your account is going to be closed or if you will not be able to receive mail for a while , send a request to be removed from the list ! If you are just going to lose access for a short while still send a request for a suspension of your membership and I will suspend forwarding of the articles to you . -- WHAT ABOUT OLD ARTICLES ? -- I am currently archiving all the articles posted to the list at the originating site ( bobsbox ) . However , I can not continue to do this due to lack of disk space . What we need is a volunteer that will maintain a compendium of articles sent to the list . They can compress and store them in archives on their system . They can then periodically post an index of the contents of the compendium and any other information that relates . If there are no volunteers then maybe someone can donate a large SCSI hard drive to me for archival purposes . < grin > I have setup a mail-based file server so that anyone interested in the list can obtain information as well as the entire archive of past articles , the membership listing and other information pertaining to the LightWave3D mailing list . For information on this service , please send a mail message to : fileserver @ bobsbox.rent.com The first command to the server must be `` HELP '' or `` USER name < passwd > '' . Use HELP to request a current copy of the helpfile . Use USER name [ passwd ] to connect to the service . Use ? to get a short listing of all available commands . -- NOW WHAT DO I DO ? -- Well , sit back and enjoy the pouring out of information . If you have something to offer , please feel free to contribute that information to the list . Every little bit helps . Questions are welcomed ! It makes some of us feel important when we can answer them . < grin > If you have any questions or comments regarding the list , please contact me at the address : lightwave-admin @ bobsbox.rent.com Cheers , Bob Lindabury

If you have trouble finding the place , please call the office on 071-823-6550 . Or , call me ( Russell Whitaker ) on my pager , 081-812-2661 , and leave an informative message with the telephone number where you can be reached ; I will return the call almost immediately . Discussion will range from the usual general topics , such as the use of secure public key cryptosystems to protect message data , to specific topics , such as recent moves by the U.S. government to restrict choice in data privacy ( reference recent discussion on Usenet groups , e.g . sci.crypt and alt.security.pgp ) . All are invited . Particularly welcome are members of the newly-formed UK CommUnity group ... the local EFF-in-spirit-if-not-in-name folks . Those who plan to attend should email me and let me know . Please . All attendees are requested to bring diskettes - preferably MS-DOS - with their PGP 2.+ public keys . As is usual at these gatherings , several of us will bring our laptops , and will sign public keys , subject to the usual caveats ( reference the documentation for PGP 2.2 , specifically files PGPDOC1.DOC and PGPDOC2.DOC ) . If you do not already have a copy of PGP 2.2 ( MS-DOS ) , and would like to have a copy of this public domain program , please bring a formatted , medium or high density 3.5 inch floppy PC diskette ; you will be provided a copy of the program . Of course , you might prefer to ftp a version of the program from one of the various archive sites . I suggest trying Demon Internet Systems , which carries the full range of PGP ( Phil Zimmerman 's `` Pretty Good Privacy '' ) implementations : directory /pub/pgp at gate.demon.co.uk .

Only last month , John Major hailed it as a great victory that he had personally secured a sale of arms to Saudi Arabia . The same month , we sold jet fighters to the same Indonesian government that 's busy killing the East Timorese .

Thanks for posting the exact wording which I had not seen previously . The part I quote above seems to me to indicate disapproval of capital punishment - it is to be used only when other means are not sufficient ; I would say this is a stronger restriction than saying that capital punishment is useable when justifiable . I would certainly say there are cases where a crime justifies death ( perhaps this is the Old Testament interpretation ) , but my reverence for life would say that I would oppose the actual infliction of the death penalty ( a New Testament interpretation ? ) . It is a matter for debate whether the death penalty works to keep the peace in a way that non-violent provisions do not . I do n't believe it does , and I would certainly observe that in the USA , where you have the death penalty , there is a far higher murder rate than here in the UK , where we do not .

The simple $ 25 style IDE controller does not use DMA . The CPU performs the data transfer with a string move instruction . This requires that the CPU stop what it had been doing and transfer the data . Only the smart drive controllers , be they IDE or SCSI , can transfer via DMA .

Again , this has > nothing to do with SCSI . Floppies are n't on the IDE bus , your arguement makes no sense , this isn't an IDE issue . The floppys have their own processor on their controller board which handles all of these commands . The difference between IDE and SCSI is that all SCSI peripherials are intelligent . They each have their own controller . They depend on the CPU to do fewer things for them , i.e . IDE drives needing a processor to transfer their data . > > Its a long story , but I still use IDE on my 486 except for the CDROM which , > > thanks to SCSI , I can move between both machines .

The dettach/callback mechanism alows the CPU to make requests of the devices on the SCSI bus and then dettach and go about its business . Later , when the device is done , it issues a callback to say that the data has arrived or the function has completed . Most SCSI cards will also DMA the data into memory without the interupting the CPU , therefore allowing it to continue working uninterupted . IDE supports no such concept as dettach/callback .

Many different observations , including IRAS > and COBE , have determined that interstellar dust grain temperatures > can range from 40K to 150K . Interstellar grains are not at all close to blackbodies . The `` large '' grains have sizes of order 0.1 micron and absorb visible light with fair efficiency . However , at temperatures below 100 K , 90 % of the thermal emission will be beyond 22 microns , where radiating efficiency is poor . ( A small antenna can not easily radiate at long wavelengths . ) Thus the grains must heat up more in order to radiate the energy they have absorbed . Moreover , the IRAS observations had a maximum wavelength of 100 microns . Grains colder than 30 K will radiate primarily at longer wavelengths , and IRAS would be relatively insensitive to them . In the extreme limit , grains as cold as 5 K will be almost undetectable by any conceivable observation . Worse still , IRAS color temperatures are heavily contaminated by a population of `` small '' grains . These grains have only perhaps 50 atoms , and when they are hit by a single photon they heat up to temperatures of several hundred or 1000 K. Of course they cool quickly and then stay cold for a while , but _when they are radiating_ the characteristic temperature is several hundred K. Even a small population of these grains can dramatically raise the observed '' average '' temperature . A model for local infrared emission consistent with COBE data has three components . These represent scattered radiation from Zodiacal dust ( color temperature 5500 K ) , thermal emission from Zodiacal dust ( Tc = 280 K ) , and thermal emission from Galactic dust ( Tc=25 K ) . At the ecliptic poles , the emissivities or dilution factors are respectively 1.9E-13 , 4E-8 , and 2E-5 . The first two are roughly doubled in the ecliptic plane . To find the thermal equilibrium temperature , we add up the dilution factor times the fourth power of temperature for all components , then take the fourth root . In the table below , starlight comes from Allen 's number that stellar emission from the whole sky is equivalent to 460 zero mag stars with B-V color of 0.75 . No doubt careful work could do much better . ( The person who suggested starlight had a dilution factor of E-4 must have been remembering wrong . We would be cooked if that were the case . In any event , the energy density of starlight comes out about the same as that of the microwave background , and I believe that to be correct . ) Dilution Temp .

From : abig @ netcom.com ( Access Bus Industry Gp ) Subject : ACCESS.bus ( Re : ACCESS.bus Software Creator 's Contest ) Organization : NETCOM On-line Communication Services ( 408 241-9760 guest ) Lines : 92 Intro to ACCESS.bus ( RE : the ACCESS.bus Software Creator 's Contest Announcement ) WHAT IS ACCESS.bus ? ACCESS.bus is a new open industry standard for computer peripheral connectivity . ACCESS.bus is a serial protocol that uses simple , low-cost I2C technology to link multiple devices to a single PC port . Peripheral devices such as keyboards or keypads , locators ( Mice , Trackballs , Joysticks ) , printers , VR gloves , digitizers , sensors , actuators or data transmitters and others can be easily daisy chained to the host PC . Applications such as CAD/CAM , Data Acquisition , Simulation , Virtual Reality , Multiple-Player/Single PC Games , Education and many , many more can now take advantage of ACCESS.bus , the technology that puts Plug and Play on every PC . The ACCESS.bus offers advantages to end-users and developers of systems and peripherals . Multiple devices connect to the host computer with only one port . Common communication methods for a number of device types lead to simplified hardware and software development . As an open standard , ACCESS.bus enables cross- platform use of the same device . ACCESS.bus TECHNOLOGICAL DESCRIPTION : ===================================== ACCESS.bus technology is an open specification , enabling anyone to implement it on host systems or in peripheral devices without fee or royalty . ACCESS.bus has a bus topology architecture . That is , a single host can accommodate up to 125 peripheral devices . ACCESS.bus data rate is 100 Kbits/sec . ACCESS.bus Physical Layer ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ACCESS.bus is a serial bus architecture , based on I2C hardware protocol , with one data line and one clock line . Standard low-cost I2C microcontrollers handle bit-level handshaking , including automatic arbitration and clock synchronization . ACCESS.bus Software Protocols ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ The ACCESS.bus communication protocol is composed of three levels : I2C Protocol , Base Protocol , and Application Protocol . I2C PROTOCOL : This simple and efficient protocol defines arbitration among contending masters without losing data . I2C provides for cooperative synchronization of bus partners with different clock rates . Bus transactions include addressing , framing of bits into bytes , and byte acknowledgment by the receiver . BASE PROTOCOL : Establishes the asymmetrical interconnect between a host computer and multiple peripherals . The host becomes the ACCESS.bus manager . The Base Protocol defines the format of an ACCESS.bus message envelope , which is an I2C bus transaction with additional semantics , including checksum . Unique features of the Base Protocol are auto-addressing and hot plugging . Auto-addressing assigns devices with unique bus addresses , without the need for setting jumpers or switches . Hot plugging is the ability to attach and detach devices while the system is running , without rebooting . APPLICATION PROTOCOL : This is the highest level of the ACCESS.bus protocol which defines message semantics specific to particular types of devices . Each type requires a different Application Protocol . Three broad device types have been identified : keyboards , locators , and text devices . ACCESS.bus support on the PC ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ All three levels of the ACCESS.bus protocol are supported on the PC . An add-on card implements the physical layer and uses the base protocol to communicate with physical ACCESS.bus devices . An ACCESS.bus Manager - TSR under DOS and a DLL under Windows 3.1 - controls the operation of the physical layer and interacts with the ACCESS.bus device drivers . Drivers are available for multiple ACCESS.bus keyboards , locators and printers for DOS and Windows 3.1 . Also available are C language source code examples of the interface from applications to the device drivers .

Serious business . They wanted to do a lumbar puncture , for which a CT scan is a prerequisite . I arrived in her hospital room about an hour after she had returned from the CT. She was in tears . Evidently the technicians in the CT lab had been very unpleasant to her . To begin with , they put her on the apparatus that moves you into the machine itself , and just pushed a button to slide her straight into the machine , without any explanation . Imagine this . You worried you may have a deadly disease , and next thing you know you 're being put into this big scary machine , without a word of explanation about what is going to happen to you . I believe this is inexcusable . She waved her hand as if to say what are you doing to me , and they responded with annoyance and anger . Next they inserted , or tried to insert , an IV catheter . Apparently she has a lot of trouble with these and complained of the pain . The technician just stopped and fixed her with a glare without any words of explanation . Is there anything I can do about these pigs ? I realize that these technicians do this sort of job day in and day out . And that some patients can be very irritating and uncooperative . But this is simply no excuse . Their purpose for existing is to help sick people , and there is no excuse for this sort of behavior . Fortunately my friend is fine . But I imagine a large proportion of the people who get CT scans are not fine at all . They have cancer and that sort of thing . They do n't need this kind of shit . Also , since I named the hospital involved , I should also point out that neither she nor I have any complaints about the competence or compassion of any of the other personnel at NCMH .

It would have to involve new physics as far as I can tell . Closest to `` conventional '' Oort sources is a model of B-field pinching by comets , it 's got too many holes in it to count , but at least it was a good try ... So you have a plausible model for GRB 's at astronomical distances ? I do n't have any plausible models for GRBs at any distances ; - ) Recent observations have just about ruled out the merging neutron star hypothesis , which had a lot of problems , anyhow . We have to look for implausible models and what is fundamentally allowed independent of models . Hmm , the `` superbowl '' burst has been claimed in press releases to cast doubt on the merging NS hypothesis , from what I 've read ( and I have n't seen the papers , only the press ) I 'd say it is consistent with some of the merging NS models A paper on the possibility of GRB 's in the Oort cloud just came through the astrophysics abstract service . To get a copy of this Here is the abstract of that paper . ... indicator to these events all possible sources which are isotropically distributed should remain under consideration . This is why the Oort cloud of comets is kept on the list , although there is no known mechanism for generating \GRBs from cometary nuclei . Unlikely as it may seem , the possibility that \GRBs originate in the solar cometary cloud can not be excluded until it is disproved . This does not propose a _mechanism_ for GRBs in the Oort ( and , no , anti-matter annihilation does not fit the spectra at least as far as I understand annihilation spectra ... ) . Big difference . That 's ignoring the question of how you fit a distribution to the Oort distribution when the Oort distribution is not well known - in particular comet aphelia ( which are not well known ) are not a good measure of the Oort cloud distribution ... * Steinn Sigurdsson Lick Observatory * * steinly @ lick.ucsc.edu '' standard disclaimer '' * * The laws of gravity are very , very strict * * And you 're just bending them for your own benefit - B.B . 1988*

Use a workProc . See XtAppAddWorkProc ( 3Xt ) . You should split your drawing routnie up into small chunks ( this is the hard part ) . Then , in the callback that starts the drawing , you call XtAppAddWorkProc ( ) to call your workProc the first time . Your workProc should be a function that returns a boolean ... TRUE when you are finished , and FALSE when you want to keep processing . If you return FALSE , the workProc is automatically re-installed . Note that this method is better that using a time-out loop , since events get processed in a more precedence-oriented manner .

Bosinan Muslims , > in collaboration with the Nazis , did to Serbians after the first world > war what Serbs are doing to Muslims now . This kind of racialist generalization is utterly inappropriate . SOME Bosnian Muslims cooperated with the Nazis in World War 2 . Other Bosnian Muslims risked their lifes to hide Jews from the Nazis and Ustashe , and those Jews who survived the war remember that . In fact the Jewish leader in Sarajevo has remained there saying he wants to repay the debt to the Bosnian Muslims that saved so many Jewish lives in WW2 . Similarly , SOME Serbs are `` doing '' to Muslims now . This is a group of serial-killers , rapists , and thieves who have control of the vast Yugoslav army arsenal . Many other Serbs oppose these atrocities . As one of Serbian heritage who condemns emphatically the genocide being carried out against Muslims by both HVO and Mladic forces , I condemn your generalization about Bosnian Muslims and about Serbs . This is not a fresh case of > ethnic cleansing but just another chapter in the continuing saga > of intense mutual hatred , destruction , ...

Thanks for posting the references . I do not normally read t.p.m. , and I posted my request for references because Jim 's article was cross-posted to soc.culture.jewish . Allegations of Jewish disrespect for the objects and buildings of other religions are one of antisemitic stereotypes that permeate western culture , and rumors of church and Host desacration probably caused more pogroms than blood libel . The stereotypes that pervade our culture create cognitive illusions that reify those stereotypes . Therefore any claim that appears to reify a stereotype should be treated by decent people with utmost suspicion until and unless documented . If such a claim is cross-posted to a news group in which it has not been documented before , such as s.c.j , a reference should be given the first time it appears . Now that the claim has been documented , I regard the whole episode as disgusting and shameful . Especially so because the official who failed to provide proper temporary facilities for the evicted Jordanians was probably Jewish , and as a Jew I know that he should have known better .

I think its a great , but idealistic idea . A reseacher will first of all try to publish a worthy paper in a credible , professional magazine and not in a community like USENET which is infamous for lots ( not all ) of junk information . The papers that will be `` published '' here will , in general , be of low quality . Also , it is improbable that any credit will be given to a researcher who publish here - and sadly , that is nowadays a main reason for publishing .

What I saw was an unnecessary , unprovoked massive attack on Feb. 28th . Probably even an illegal action by ATF , certainly way out of proportion to anything reasonable . And yet , according to a pole taken yesterday , 95 % of the people poled believe the government forces acted appropriately .

Anything would be > greatly appreciated . > -Shawn > breedsa @ wkuvx1.bitnet According to MacWeek of 2-22-93 : The Cyclone will come in the same metal minitower case as the Quadra 800 , while the Tempest will share the low-slung case of the Centris 610 . Apple will offer a miniature video camera that can be mounted above the user 's monitor or moved about on the end of its cable to take pictures of objects or documents . Taking advantage of the 32-bit digital signal processor ( DSP ) built into the systems ' logic boards , the camera will be able to put an image measuring 360 by 288 pixels , with 256 gray levels , on the screen . Users will be able to install supplementary lenses that can record detail as fine as the wire bonds on an integrated circuit . The camera is expected to cost between $ 150 and $ 250 . The systems will ship with all the software needed to put Apple's Casper voice-recognition technology to work ; users apparently will have to purchase an operational high-fidelity microphone . The two models will talk as well as listen . A new system facility called the Speech Manager will convert text strings sent by applications to phonemes and then pass them to a speech synthesizer . The Cyclone will include a 40MHz '040 , three NuBus slots and support for up to 128MB of RAM . The Tempest will use a 25MHz LC040 , lacking an FPU , and hold up to 68MB of RAM ; it will have a single slot that will require a NuBus adapter and have room for only 7-inch NuBus cards . Users will be able to update the Tempest 's process but not the Cyclone 's . For more get the 02.22.93 issue of MacWeek .

It is nothing > more that an anti-Catholic tract of the sort published ever since the there > were protestants . Its scholarship is phony and its assertions spurious . I have not seen this book , though I have had several people quote it in support of some tendentious assertions they were making , so I have become curious about it . I do n't want to malign this Hislop fellow , whoever he may be , as I have only heard the arguments at second hand , but both of the arguments seemed to turn on false etymology that SEEMED to be derived from Hislop . I would be interested in knowing more about these things . The first one claimed that the word `` church '' was derived from the Greek '' cyclos '' , and that it was therefore related to the worship of `` Circe '' . I do n't know if Hislop is the source of this assertion , but it does seem to be based on false etymology . The second claimed an etymological relationship between `` Ishtar '' and '' Easter '' , which seemed to be even more fanciful and far-fetched than some of the wilder notions of the British Israelites . Regarding the latter , as far as I have been able to find out , `` Easter '' is derived from the old English name for April - `` Eosturmonath '' . The Venerable Bede mentioned that this was associated with a goddess called `` Eostre '' , but apart from that reference I have not been able to find out anything more about her . It also seems that the term `` Easter '' is only used by the English and those they evangelized . The Germans , for example , also use the term '' Ostern '' , but Germany was evangelized by English missionaries . So I would be interested in any evidence of `` Easter '' being used for Pascha by people who do not have any kind of connection with the ancient Anglo- Saxons and their offshoots . Such evidence might support the claims of those who appear to derive the theory from Hislop . ============================================================ Steve Hayes , Department of Missiology & Editorial Department Univ . of South Africa , P.O .

It attracts > way more attention than the Camaro/Firebird because it 's heritage > is more embedded in the general public . Do n't lie to yourself and > believe Ford will forfeit that . The car magazines have printed a lot of information about the new Mustang and the consensus about what to believe in my `` car circle '' is that the suspension pieces and tuning will be almost identical to the current Cobra , but on a stiffer body structure which will improve its behavior . After the MN12 ( Thunderbird ) cost and weight debacle , Ford decided independent rear suspension with rear wheel drive wo n't be tried again in a volume car . The current 4.9l V-8 will soldier on for about two years . A version of the 32 valve modular V-8 in the Mark VIII could be offered then . Ford is spending big money tooling up for 2.5l and 3.5l V-6 engines which will power most of their cars in the immediate future , and therefore probably do not consider volume production of 300 hp V-8 engines a priority . Undisguised , the car looks OK , but not nearly as exciting as the new Camaro/Firebird , IMO . I suspect Ford will produce their car with higher quality than GM will achieve with the Camaro/ Firebird . The way GM loses money , the temptation to `` just get them out the door '' for the sake of positive cash flow will be great once demand really takes off . Tim Gardner

I looked > twice at porting emu to linux , but stopped short becuse of the tty > part . Is there a ` cleaner ' version of emu that supports POSIX tty > explicitly ? Hmm , depends on how you define 'clean ' . Jordan implemented the system dependent stuff in a way that you have basic implementations for , call it , operating system types , then you go ahead and write a include file for your specific machine or operating system using the basic implementations . Since both Jordan and I have n't encountered a OS flavor yet , that is fully POSIX , we have n't gotten around to really implement ( and test ) a top-level include file specifically for just posix . The posix routines are used in the sun specific file tty_sun.i for example , but here we also use some bsd stuff . All in all it still is probably better to implement a include file for each and every operating system than ' # ifdef'ing in existing ones . The type of mess that can result from that can clearly be seen in the xterm sources . Even if quite a bit of code gets copied almost unchanged a couple of times , this only uses up some disk space , since only the '' drivers '' actually included from the toplevel include file will be compiled into emu . It should n't be hard to come up with a tty_linux.i file that fully relies on the posix stuff , but unfortunately I do n't have a linux system available to me , so I ca n't do the port myself . I would suggest you read the README in term/sysdep and if you have any problems or questions , contact me and we could try to sort this out . Unfortunately we have to rely on help from the net on this part of emu , since we just do n't have access to that many different systems .

Source : Cemal Kutay , `` Ottoman Empire , '' vol . II. , p. 188 . `` The atrocities and massacres which have been committed for a long time against the Muslim population within the Armenian Republic have been confirmed with very accurate information , and the observations made by Rawlinson , the British representative in Erzurum , have confirmed that these atrocities are being committed by the Armenians . The United States delegation of General Harbord has seen the thousands of refugees who came to take refuge with Kazim Karabekir 's soldiers , hungry and miserable , their children and wives , their properties destroyed , and the delegation was a witness to the cruelties . Many Muslim villages have been destroyed by the soldiers of Armenian troops armed with cannons and machine guns before the eyes of Karabekir 's troops and the people . When it was hoped that this operation would end , unfortunately since the beginning of February the cruelties inflicted on the Muslim population of the region of Shuraghel , Akpazar , Zarshad , and Childir have increased . According to documented information , 28 Muslim villages have been destroyed in the aforementioned region , more than 2,000 people have been slaughtered , many possessions and livestock have been seized , young Muslim women have been taken to Kars and Gumru , thousands of women and children who were able to flee their villages were beaten , raped and massacred in the mountains , and this aggression against the properties , lives , chastity and honour of the Muslims continued . It was the responsibility of the Armenian Government that the cruelties and massacres be stopped in order to alleviate the tensions of Muslim public opinion due to the atrocities committed by the Armenians , that the possessions taken from the Muslims be returned and that indemnities be paid , that the properties , lives , and honour of the Muslims be protected .

And did I ever learn to read labels . > - it might not please a medical researcher - but it pleased my own > personal physician enough for him to give me allergy medicine -Allergy medicine , huh ? Is this just to get rid of the resultant migraine or whatever , or does it actually suppress allergic reactions ? ( i.e . like an antihistamine does ? ) As far as doctors over here are concerned , if you slip up and eat something you 're allergic to ( even if they wo n't test you to tell you what to avoid ) then tough ; if a _cheap_ medicine will alleviate your symptoms , then fine , otherwise you just suffer . One doctor did prescribe me imigran ( costs the NHS # 48 for 6 tablets ) after having to rehydrate me because I 'd been throwing up for four solid days and could n't even drink water - but I got taken off it again when I moved and had to change doctors . Reasoning : they did not know what the side-effects were because it was new . OK , fine - but it has passed the safety tests to get on the prescription list , and anyway I was prepared to take the risk to have quality of life now . The only alternatives I have is to get it prescribed privately , which I can not afford , or to pay a private allergy specialist to test me and tell me what to avoid . I am fairly certain I am allergic to more than one chemical additive , as a lot of things I ca n't eat have nothing in common except things I know are safe , so testing myself is n't really an option ; there are too many permutations . > I 'm not saying I NEVER consume ANYTHING with MSG .

Yes , I 've noticed that - and I can work it up by eating just under the tolerance level fairly regularly . If I do n't eat anything except home cooking for a month or so I lose it and have to work it up from scratch ... a bad experience . Now I know what the early-warning symptoms are , though , I can usually tell whether I am allergic to food before I 've eaten too much of it ... usually ...

If it is used to make circuit boards it is called FR-4 . The same material is used in the cryogenics industrya and marine industries as a structural material and is called G-10 . FR-4 and G-10 are both green . They are not green because of a solder masking agent . The basic ingredients are a clear epoxy resin and glass fibers . I am not sure what the specs are on the resin , but if you are really curious you can call NEMA ( National Electronics Manufacturing Association ) or Ciba Geigy ( a major manufacturer of epoxy resins ) to find out . As an aside , I occasionally mix clear epoxy and glass microsphres to cast small structures for cryogenics experiments . The proportions of glass to epoxy are about the same as in G-10 .

I think it may also be worthwhile pointing out that if we take the appellation ` Rabbi ' seriously then Jesus had a full grasp of contemporary ` scripture' Mat21:42 Jesus saith unto them , Did ye never read in the scriptures ... Mat22:29 Jesus answered and said unto them , Ye do err , not knowing Mat22:29 the scriptures , nor the power of God . Following from this , he would have been in a wonderful position to fulfil prophesies , and the NT says as much : Mat26:54 But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled , Mat26:54 that thus it must be ? Mat26:56 But all this was done , that the scriptures of the Mat26:56 prophets might be fulfilled . Then all the disciples Mat26:56 forsook him , and fled .

Because the temperature of your hand , *unlike that of the battery* , is determined by the balance between internal heat production and external heat loss .

In the case of an object with no significant internal heat production , this will affect how quickly it comes into equilibrium with its surroundings ( if it started out not in equilibrium with them ) but wo n't affect the final temperature .

From : glazer @ ohstpy.mps.ohio-state.edu Subject : Local Windows .vs . Shared Windows ( Discussion ) Organization : The Ohio State University , Department of Physics Lines : 110 I would like to see a serious discussion on the best way to install windows from a Novell administrator 's point of view . I just got off the phone with MS Access support and was told that they ( Microsoft ) has decided to implement , as a standard for software support , the LOCAL setup ( described below ) as the `` most advantageous installation '' . If this is true and Microsoft deems this to be the most prudent installation then I will comply but I 'd like to hear it from administrators first . The LOCAL Windows Installation : ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Windows is fully installed on each workstation hard drive ( assuming the resources are available ) . From a network administrator 's implementation , he/she would install all windows disks on a network drive using SETUP/A . Then install windows on a per/machine bases by running SETUP off the network to install the complete system on the local drives . In this way , all drivers are available to the SETUP procedure w/o the need to change disks . Advantages : - Reduce Traffic - Running Windows locally reduces network traffic due to the local access of main Windows files . - Network independence - If the network fails ( and they all do at one point or another ) , the local installation would allow users to keep producing and reduce the cost of down-time . - Faster Windows - Theoretically , Windows will run faster from a local hard drive than over a network . This may be a hard point to prove if the network has an optical backbone and/or the network drives are significantly faster access than local ones . - A user traveling from machine to machine does not need to worry about varying setups ( monochrome , color , types of mouse , etc ... ) since the Windows installation is assigned to the Workstation . Disadvantages : - Cost - Installing Windows locally requires a significant amount of disk space . Workstations now must be purchased with a hard disk that can increase the cost of the workstation from 10 to 30 percent . - Administration - Local windows installations are very difficult to administer . New drivers for peripherals are constantly being made available , each of which would have to be individually installed on each workstation . - Security - Users now have access to erase or corrupt their own system files from simple ignorance . This could result in quite a headache for administrators who may have to constantly repair damaged installations . - Backup - We all know the problems backing up local hard disks . The backup sets ( if done via a centralized tape system ) get very large very quickly . Backup individually ( to floppy ) may not happen at all . This may be eliminated if it is assumed that local hard disks only contain replaceable applications and *not* user data . The SHARED Windows Installation ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Windows is fully installed to a network disk via the SETUP/A procedure described above . Users ( or administrators ) then install a minimal set of files to individual `` user '' directories . These directories may be on a local hard disk or perhaps a network `` home '' directory . The bulk of the Windows system files are maintained on the network in a single directory ( some 400+ files ) and are accessed ( shared ) as-needed by users throughout their Windows session . The user 's files consist of a small set of files that the user has updated during his/her Windows session . These include group files , .INI files and other regularly updated files . Advantages : - A single location for all files makes updates to drives easy . As an updated driver becomes available , it only needs to be installed in this single directory for all users to be able to take advantage of it . - Assuming that the users ' files are maintained in network ( home ) directories , the administrator can easily edit any .INI file as-needed to correct problems that may arise . This includes WIN.INI and SYSTEM.INI . - Backup of all pertinent files is done easily . Even if the users ' files are on a local hard disk , the bulk of the Windows system is backed up with all driver updates . Disadvantages : - Network traffic - since all Windows files are being shared in a network directory , traffic on the network can become a problem an effect the speed of Windows . - If the network crashes , all production comes to a stop since Window's is reliant upon the network for its files . Loss of data usually occurs as well since users working in Windows at the time of the crash will usually not be able to save their work . - Although minimal , disk space is still a consideration . If the users ' files are maintained on the network , a large number of users can cause a significant utilization of disk space due to their personal Windows files alone . - Users can not easily move from machine to machine unless the workstation hardware are similar . This is due to the Windows installation being tied to a particular username ( in the case of Network user files ) . The Discussion ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I would like to know , from other administrators with a large Windows userbase , how they prefer setting up Windows . Personally , I have setup numerous installations using the SHARED setup . All Windows and application files are on the network with little or no utilization of local hard disks . In fact , I sold a network on the fact that the company would no longer need to purchase hard disks for their workstations and thus save that much more money . I would also like to see recommendations for applications . Should apps such as Word and/or Excel be installed locally regardless of how Windows is installed ? Again , I keep all files on the network for easy backup and administration but this is `` putting all eggs in one basket '' ; if the network crashes , work comes to a halt . Now I am sure Microsoft ( and I know your out there ) has their own ideas about this and their insights would be of great value but I hope to hear from people with `` actual '' working experience with users and network administration .

My feeling on baptism is this : parents baptize their baby so that the baby has the sanctifying grace of baptism ( and thus removal of original sin ) on its soul in the event of an unexpected death . That is , the parents speak on behalf of the child which is too young to speak on its own . This should not surprise anyone : do n't parents *always* do what they believe is the best for their baby ? Why would that apply to the baby 's physical needs only but not his/her spiritual needs to have God 's grace ? The purpose of confirmation is for the baby ( now young adult ) to decide to re-affirm for himself/herself the promises that his/her parents made at baptism . That is where accepting Jesus into your heart comes in . In baptism , the parents ask Jesus to come into their baby 's heart ; at confirmation the child repeats that request independently . ( By the way , these are my personal feelings , though I believe they are pretty close to what the doctrinal position of the Catholic Church on this issue . Can anyone out there back me up or correct me ?

Simple stuff , > like b & w logos , etc . do pretty well , while more complicated stuff goes > haywire . The first and only thing I 've ever tried to auto-trace was a piece of a USCG nautical chart using Adobe Illustrator 3.2 . I wanted to get the outline of the coast for Western Long Island Sound . I was simultaneously suprised at how good a job it did and disappointed at how poorly it did . I suspect what I gave it was a very difficult thing ; not only is the coastline very irregular , but overlaid on the chart are numerous sets of gridlines ( not only lattitude and longitude , but loran grids as well ) . The most common mistake it make was whenever the coastline was roughly parallel and tangent to a grid line , it would take off following the gridline instead of the coast . I think the best improvement would be some sort of interactive algorithm that would let you step in and say `` no , dummy , you 're going the wrong way '' . Steve Reisberg , a friend of mine a few years back ( * ) , did his doctoral work analysing electron micrographs of filimentous phage ( virii ) . A good chunk of the work was writing a program to take a digitized micrograph and automatically trace the centerline of the virus particles . This is essentially the same problem that Illustrator tries to solve with its auto-trace tool . In some respects the problem Steve worked on was harder , since he was trying to do quantitative analysis of the virus structure and finding a good centerline was only the first step , but a step on which all future analysis depended . However , in other respects , it was an easier problem since the program could be written with a lot of knowledge about what the virus particles were supposed to look like , and the analysis could be restricted to those particles which happend to be relatively straight , clean , and well imaged ; you do n't always have that freedom auto-tracing real life images . In any case , it gave me some insight into just how difficult this problem is to solve in the general case . ( * ) Steve is no longer with us . He and his wife disappeared while on vacation in Hawaii a couple of years after they graduated . Their last known location was hiking in a densely wooded in a mountainous area . While no bodies were ever found , they are presumed to have been the victim of some sort of fall or accident in the woods . -- Roy Smith < roy @ nyu.edu > Hippocrates Project , Department of Microbiology , Coles 202 NYU School of Medicine , 550 First Avenue , New York , NY 10016 '' This never happened to Bart Simpson .

No , MIS folks have infinite budgets of death , and they also get parts of their budget allocated `` upgrades '' , `` maintenance '' , and `` new purchases '' , and a lot of IBM mainframe purchases are actually `` leases '' and so is the software . Basically , the engineers who have tight budgets , i.e . the coders and designers of a company , bitch and moan when they drop 15,000 on a Sparc 1 only to see a faster machine appear a year later . MIS types upgrade once every 5-10 years , and their costs are amortized and depreciated over a longer period , and the budget office justifies the expense because they actually use the machines for accounting , payroll , etc . Now , if the budget office was dependant on the engineers for some reason like payroll and accounts , you 'd sure as hell see every engineer with a new Cray on his desktop every year . : - ) Brian

Sci. , Urbana , IL Lines : 13 I posted on here about a problem with a Datadesk 101e keyboard that failed to rebuild the desktop with the command-option keys pressed or to shut off inits when pressing the shift key . After absolutely no help from Datadesk I called MacConnection tech support . They tried it out on their Centris 610 and had the same problem . They immediately offered to get a new keyboard , try it on their Centris and ship it to me overnight if it worked . I could send them my keyboard back after I got the one that worked . This is from a guy in Tech support named Dave . It turns out that the keyboard will wrok if you wait for the smiley face before pressing the shift key to disable inits and wait for the inits to start appearing to rebuild the desktop by pressing command-option . I really like this keyboard so I was glad to be able to keep it . On the other hand , Datadesks tech support sucks while MacConnection 's is great ! -Terry

It is not a question of an individuals standing . When a party puts up an Arab for a Cabinet post and that Arab is rejected but the position is given to a Jew from the same party we are not talking about power but racism . Would you care to deny this has happened on several occasions with Labour coalitions ? > In the past , they have not been effective at garnering votes and forming > a single bloc in the knesset . On the few occasions when this was done , > some of the parties took stands that were extremist , and ineffect precluded > themselves from forming a coalition and participating in the cabinet . Not their party - them as *individuals* . Even when they belong to nice peaceful Zionist mainstream parties they are not welcome . Arabs are excluded on ficitious security grounds which are just an excuse . It sure looks like racism to me . Arabs are excluded from cabinet , even when they do the things you suggest , because they are Arabs . Unless of course you have a better reason ?

This must vary from state to state , because our old company Kemper wanted to drop me ( keeping my wife ) or tripple our premium because i had 1 ticket . Only 2 points for 10 mph over speed limit . Well i called Geico , and they insured both my wife and i for less then we were previously paying Kemper . Generally i hate the whole insurance game .

Suggestions ? An even better strategy is to leave less of a buffer between you and the car in front , but enough to manuver around it . Keep the bike in 1st gear with the clutch handle squeezed in ( how 's that for engaged/disengaged ? ) , until there are two cars stopped behind you . When the next BDI cager comes screaching in , simply ride up along side of the car in front of you . You do n't need to panic and do it , or you will pop the clutch and stall the engine .

Energy Secretary Hails President 's Plan For Alternative Fuel Vehicles To : National Desk , Environment and Energy Reporters Contact : Larry Hart of the U.S. Department of Energy , 202-586-5806 WASHINGTON , April 21 -- Secretary of Energy Hazel R. O'Leary today said President Clinton 's Executive Order on Alternative Fuels will make the federal government a `` driving force behind efforts to increase the availability of both alternative fuel vehicles and fuel supplies . '' President Clinton signed the order today , which calls for federal purchases of alternative fuel vehicles in numbers over the next three years at least 50 percent higher than those called for in the Energy Policy Act of 1992 . President Clinton also announced that Texas Land Commissioner Gary Mauro will head up the Federal Fleet Conversion Task Force to advise O'Leary on implementation of the Executive Order . `` I am delighted that I will be working with Gary Mauro to make this happen , '' O'Leary said . `` As Land Commissioner , Gary Mauro has helped make Texas a national leader in converting the state fleet to alternative fuels , and has been a tireless proponent of natural gas vehicles in speeches across the country . '' The task force is to issue a report within 90 days recommending a plan and schedule of implementation . `` The Department of Energy and all of us in government must lead by example if the option of alternative fuels is going to become a practical , affordable choice for fleet owners across the country , '' O'Leary said . `` Increased use of domestically-produced alternative fuels means reducing pollution while creating jobs . We believe that energy efficiency , protecting the environment , and a healthy economy are complimentary goals . '' O'Leary said that plans call for the Department of Energy to coordinate the agencies ' five-year purchase plans , help with funding for extra purchase or conversion costs , and work with GSA to encourage development of the fuel infrastructure needed to make fleet conversions practical . Under the order , the Department of Energy will also be working with states , local governments and industry to coordinate vehicle purchases and encourage manufacturers and fuel suppliers to make alternative fuel vehicles and alternative fuels more widely available . -30- -- Canada Remote Systems - Toronto , Ontario 416-629-7000/629-7044

If you are surveying our individual philosophies , fine , but that 's not strictly atheism . Atheism is not just another , godless version of the theistic explanations for life , the universe and everything . It is not a belief system , and it could hardly be called a philosophical system . Once more : Atheism is characterised by lack of belief in deities . Do not twist the meaning , or assume that we have some kind of philosophy we all agree on . Some comments on your questions : > What contact with other atheists have you had ; before and after ( and during ) > your `` conversion '' to atheism ? ( Certainly your involvement with alt.atheism > counts -- how have net discussions affected your beliefs ? ) I would also like to hear more about this . Have we been able to 'convert' anyone ? > Are you convinced that your beliefs were acquired through wholly rational > means ( proofs of the non-existence of God , etc ) , or was it perhaps , at least > in part , through other means ( alienation from mainstream religion , etc ) ? This question contains a contradiction in terms . _Beliefs_ can not be acquired rationally - if they could , they would not be beliefs ! You also seem to have rather strange ideas of how people become atheists - those who are alienated from religion do not necessarily become atheists , they just think very little about religion . It seems it requires a considerable time of honest inquiry to find out that religions are actually intellectually dishonest virtual realities . Those who have never had beliefs will certainly find this question quite odd - how can lack of belief be acquired ? When did I acquire lack of belief in the Easter Bunny ?

What phenomena of the universe and of human existence ( anything > from physical phenomena to the problem of the existence of evil in human > affairs ) do you feel are adequately dealt with by your beliefs , and where > are they lacking as an explanatory method ? This question does not make any sense , since atheism does not deal with these issues - it is not a worldview , or a philosophy , or a belief system .

Janus , M.D. , John Wiley & Sons ( pub ) , 1992 ) has the following : Table 3.14 Have you ever had a homosexual experience ? Men . Women . N= 1,335 1,384 Yes 22 % 17 % No 78 % 83 % Table 3.15 How often have you had homosexual contact ? Men Women N= 294 235 a . Once 5 % 6 % b . Occasionally 56 % 67 % c. Frequently 13 % 6 % d. Ongoing 26 % 21 % Active ( c. + d. ) 39 % 37 % 39 % of 22 % is 9 % . This number is consistent with Kinsey , Pomery , Gebard ( 1953 ) , Bell & Weinberg ( 1967 , 1974 ) , and Rice ( 1987 ) in the finding that 9 % of the male population is actively homosexual , with an further breakdown ( Bell & Wienberg , 1978 ) of 4 % exclusively so and 5 % self-identifying themselves as `` bisexuals . '' ( pp 69 , 70 ) As for debunking Kinsey , the following article is an important lesson for everyone to read : Was Kinsey a Fake and a Pervert ? by Philip Nobile Far out on the grassy knoll of sexology , there is a cult of prochastity researchers who claim that the late Alfred Kinsey was a secret sex criminal , a Hoosier Dr. Mengele , who bent his numbers toward the bisexual and the bizarre in a grand conspiracy to queer the nation and usher in an era of free sex with kids . But what really riles these critics is Kinsey 's towerin~ cultural influence . His bestselling surveys -- Sexual Behavior in the Human Male ( 1948 ) and Sexual Behavior in the Human Female ( 1953 ) -- tore the sheets off the country 's erogenous zones and undermined midcentury morals . His charts and graphs , based on detailed histories of 12,000 men and women , demonstrated that practices generally considered rare and/or 'abnormal ' -- masturbation , extramarital relations , homosexuality , and even barnyard bestiality , were as American as strawberry shortcake . Yet for a hard core of these heterosexual supremacists , aided and abetted by Pat Buchanan and the religious right , the zoology professor from Indiana University remains the evil genius behind the sex revolution and a target for character assassination . Judith Reisman , the prosecution 's expert witness at the Mapplethorpe trial in Cincinnati , is the leader of the anti- Kinsey revisionists as well as his Inspector Javert . In 1983 , during a radio interview with Pat Buchanan in Washington , Reisman accused Kinsey of having been inolved in `` the vicious genital torture of hundreds of children . '' She speculated that he kidnapped and drugged ghetto boys in order to carry out clandestine orgasm tests . Now , seven years later , Reisman has revived her charges in a different book , titled Kinsey , Sex and Fraud , just released by the small and religiously oriented Huntington House in Lafayette , Louisiana . Her coauthor is Ed Eichel , a Manhattan psychotherapist who has invented a new style of intromission ( `` the coital alignment technique '' ) that supposedly triggers simultaneous orgasm with considerable regularity and thereby increases compatibilty between the sexes . In the book Eichel contends that `` Kinsey deliberately cooked the gay stats because , being an oddball himself , he wanted to advance the 'denormalization ' of heterosexuality . '' If the authors are right , then the world- famous Kinsey Reports are , as the introduction boldly asserts , `` the most egregious example of scientific deception in this century . '' And if they are wrong , Kinsey , Sex and Fraud is a shameful smear . Despite the less- than- stellar credentials of Kinsey's detractors , legends are not what they used to be . Martin Luther King may have committed plagiarism . Bruno Bettelheim slapped young mental patients around . Father Bruce Ritter , the founder of Covenant House , preyed on runaway boys . Closer to Kinsey , Masters and Johnson have been disgraced for faking it in one way or another . So it should not surprise anybody that Kinsey , who filmed strange people having sex in his attic , may have had skeletons in the closet . The problem is that Reisman does not seem to have the intellectual prowess to pull off the job . As a thinker , the woman is no Madame Curie . The 55-year-old former songwriter for Captain Kangaroo has little professional standing , no current university position , and no peer-review publications , though her creative 1983 resume was padded with phantom accomplishments . For instance , it listed a book as her own -- Take Back the Night : Women on Pornography -- that was actually written and edited by others . Then there is her Ph.D. in Speech Communication from Cleveland 's Case Western Reserve University . Although Reisman has no bachelor 's degree , Case granted her a master 's in 1976 and a doctorate in 1979 . Her dissertation was on the commentaries of a local octagenarian TV commentator . But on the resume , Reisman gave this piece of scholarship a fancy Hautes Etudes moniker -- to wit : `` The Application of Aristotelian and Systems Analytic Theory to Mass Media Effects . '' When Reisman burst into prominence on Buchanan 's program , it was love at first sight for Al Regnery , the outwardly anti- porn head of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention in Ed Meese's Justice Department . Regnery was a young law-and-order conservative and amateur social philosopher who wanted to help change the sexual climate of the United States . After Reisman 's sensational radio session , the sexual equivalent of Joe McCarthy 's Wheeling speech , Regnery summoned her to meetings to discuss mutual interests . First he tried to shovel her $ 800,000 for a quasi-Frankenstein study that was going to measure the brain chemicals of men and boys who looked at arousing photographs . Guffaws on Capitol Hill killed the original proposal , but $ 734,000 in govemment money went to Reisman anyway for plan B- a probe of child images in the cartoons Playboy , Penthouse , and Hust ler . ( Incredibly , this grant surpassed the entire budget of the attorney general 's pornography commission . ) When the overpriced and oversold project was completed in 1986 , it was immediately shelved by an embarrassed Justice Department . That spring , Regnery resigned from his post only days before the New Republic carried this admission that he had kept porno magazines around the house . Notwithstanding the six-figure humiliation , Reisman went on to scratch out a niche on the ioony right . As the darling of the sex cranks , she deplores subversive phenomena like shaved genitalia in men 's magazines and blames AIDS on gays . Kinsey , Sex and Fraud is Reisman 's latest grasp for respectability . Pat Buchanan , of course , is putting his Krugerrands on Reisman 's ultimate vindication . `` This book is social dynamite , '' he says in a blurb an the front cover . He especially liked the antigay parts . Smacking his lips in his syndicated column , he declared , `` It may just blow the sewer cap off Kinsey 's monumental reputation , reestablish homosexuality as a 1-in-50 aberration , expose the Gay Rights movement as a paper tiger , and even put at risk the enormous sex industry built upon Dr. Kinsey's 'research . ' '' The blockbuster charge at the heart of the cluttered and repetilive j'Accuse is that Kinsey was a sex-mad pedophile who molested little boys in Nazi-type experiments and recorded their orgasms in his male volume/ A similar charge was first recited at the Fifth World Conference on Sexology in Jerusalem in 1981 to no effect before being recycled by Reisman for Buchanan in Washington in 1983 . Here is how Reisman and Eichel repackaged the Mengele business in Kinsey , Sex and Fraud : Mengele-like 'scientific ' experiments on infants and children were the basis for Kinsey 's conclusions ... on childhood sexuality . Somewhere and sometime in the course of the project , Kinsey appears to have directed experimental sex research on several hundred children aged from two months to almost 15 years . This , of course , would implicate Kinsey and his team in promoting , and perhaps participating in , the criminal activity . In the opinion of this book 's authors , that is exactly how part of Kinsey 's child sexuality research took place . Donning his psychohistorian 's cap and citing an FBI manual on child molesters as a guide , Eichel casually diagnoses Kinsey as a homosexual pedophile with the perfect motive for doing exactly as Reisman said : [ Kinsey ] placed himself in professional and nonprofessional positions where he had access to young boys , such as Y.M.C.A . camp counselor , boys ' club leader , and Boy Scout leader -- activities he kept up 'during his college and graduate yeaers , and even after his marriage . '' As crude as his analysis seems , Eichel was more than happy to elaborate even further in a recent phone interview . `` If you 've ever been around boy- lovers , pedophiles , they are absolutely compulsive , '' he averred . `` Everything in his life is directed at getting children . I did n't mention this in our book but the caption under Kinsey 's high school picture was a quote from Hamlet : 'Man delights me not , no , [ sic ] nor woman neither . ' What do you think they were picking up on ? '' Before weighing what Reisman and Eichel pass off as proof of Kinsey 's sex crimes , something must be said about Kinsey 's scientific modus operandi . He was a fiendish collector . As a young zoologist with a D.Sc . from Harvard , he collected 4 million gall wasps and 1.5 million related insects . When he switched to sex exploration after agreeing to teach a marriage Course at Indiana University in 1938 , he was no less curious or acquisitive . Nothing that mammals did in the realm of reproduction was foreign to him . He compiled masses of erotic materials including toilet wall inscriptions from male and female johns that highlighted differences in sexual psychology and flms of mating in 14 species of animals that showed an amazing similarity in oral eroticism . Naturally , the sexual response of children , the genesis of eros , fascinated him . It was impossible to understand the sexual behaviors of adults without examining their origins . And so with the fervor of his bughunting days , Kinsey collected information about kids , though even his worst enemies -- until Reisman and Eichel -- refrained from linking him personally to his data on preadolescent sex . Kinsey said plainly in the male volume that he got information on the sex life of young boys from people who had sex with them : `` Some of these adults are technically trained persons who have kept diaries or other records which have been put at our disposal . '' Although he gathered much boyhood data from the memories of his subjects and the observations of parents and nursery school teachers , he treated the documentary materia ! of the pedophiles as pure gold . There was nothing like it in the literature . Kinsey 's main source , a 63-year-old govemment worker , was also the most unforgettable character he had ever met . This man , whose history took 17 hours to log , had sex with over 600 boys and 200 girls as well as 17 of 33 family members including his father and grandmother . A sexual hobbyist and passionate record-keeper , he gave Kinsey detailed accounts of orgasms that he observed in preadolescent boys . Relying on the man 's meticulous research , which involved following some boys for as long as 16 years , Kinsey was able to identify for the first time six distinct types of male orgasm -- some of which involved violent contortions at the peak of release -- as well as the speed and the capacity of climax . What Freud had only imagined about childhood sexuality , Kinsey had reported as fact . Children were indeed erotic beings from the cradle . `` These data on the sexual activities of younger male provide an important substantiation of the Freudian view of sexuality as a component that is present in the human animal from earliest infancy , '' he concluded without raising eyebrows in 1948 . Then along came Judith Reisman . Ignorng the legitimacy of Kinsey 's inquiry , she beheld the ghost of Mengele in Bloomington . She was appalled by the thought of infant ecstasy and read torture in the portrayals of prepubertal orgasm rendered by the government worker . And she dared to say that Kinsey was a sex criminal . Well , was he or was n't he ? Let 's go to the text . There is no evidence in Kinsey , Sex and Fraud -- no witnesses , no paper , noteven a trace of hearsay -- that implicates Kinsey in either planning or partaking in child sex experiments . After 12 years on the trail , Reisman has uncovered just two sources to back up her original charge- - amazingly enough , Kinsey himself and Wardell Pomeroy , Kinsey's coauthor on both reports , to whom Reisman has never spoken . It turns out that her whole case rests on a few passages in the male volume iand in Pomeroy 's 1972 biography titled Dr. Kinsey and the Institute for Sex Research . After frisking every `` the '' and `` and '' in both books , Reisman came up with what she believes are `` smoking '' sentences . To establish Kinsey 's alleged role in the planning , she says that `` there is a hint '' in the fifth chapter of the male volume that Kinsey `` directed '' the orgasm studies on kids . She cites his tell-tale quote from a critic of armchair psychoanalysis demanding that `` writers ... test their theories ... by empirical study and statistical procedures . '' Then she combines this quote with Kinsey 's statement that some of the observations of his pedophile sources `` were continued over periods of months or years until the individuals were old enough to make it certain that true orgasm was involved . '' Putting two and two together -- Kinsey 's empiricism and lengthy experimentation -- she arrives at her hint . But realizing this dog would not hunt , she devoted but a single paragraph to Kinsey's supposed planning before shifting to the issue of his personal involvement . As for the alleged participation , after poring over Pomeroy 's biography , Reisman found several hidden clues suggesting Kinsey 's likely hands-on approach to kiddie sex . Here the chain of reasoning is more complex . She points out that Kinsey was interested in clitoral measurements , collecting sperm and filming sex in his attic . Since Kinsey did indeed mislead Indiana University about the purpose of his cinematography -- he said that he was filming `` animal sex '' -- Reisman asserts that a `` similar misrepresentation may yet apply to Kinsey 's child sex experiments . '' Catch the `` may '' ! Reisman was also struck by Kinsey 's doubting Thomas attitude toward the never before recorded climax of female rabbits : `` Kinsey , according to Pomeroy , was the type of person who needed to see things for himself . Pomeroy gave the example of orgasm in the female rabbit . Because he had not personally witnessed this event , Kinsey had difficulty in accepting its reality , even on the strength of testimony from a distinguished scientist . How then did Kinsey testify to the actuality of orgasm in a 5-month-old infant from the mere 'history ' of a sex offender ? '' ( But , of course , he did not : he depended on their records . ) From this fantastic alchemy of conjecture mixed with clitorides , sperm , attic cumshots , and climax-in-cottontail has Reisman defamed the legendary Kinsey . Paul Gebhard succeeded Kinsey as the director of the Kinsey Institute and now lives in retirement outside Bloomington . Reached by telephone , Gebhard defended the pedophile connection and denied Reisman 's nasty imputations . `` I do n't understand the resistance of people like Reisman to studying the sexuality of children , '' Gebhard said more in exasperation than anger . `` That is where sex begins . We were happy to take data wherever we found it . Even though pedophiles commit criminal acts , they are usually not violent folks . They would n't be very successful if they were . One of our best sources was a headmaster of a boys ' school who maintained a kind of alumni club and sometimes went to the weddings of his former students . As for directing experiments , that 's absurd . We never told any of our subjects what to do . lt was against our principles . Almost all of the pedophile material was retrospective anyway . Nor did we ever conduct sex experiments with children ourselves . That would have been highly inappropriate . '' I asked Gebhard if Kinsey had ever seen a child in a sexual situation . `` I think a mother once brought in a little girl who humped her teddy bear and Kinsey watched it . '' As for Kinsey 's sex life , it is still shrouded in confidentiality . He was married to the same woman for 35 years and fathered four children . Apparently , there are no huge sexual revelations , although rumors of homosexuality have persisted without confirmation through the years . Gebhard took his boss 's history back in the '40s , but he refuses to discuss what he knows . `` We never divulge anything about anybody 's history , whether dead or alive , '' he says . Reisman said no to an interview for this article on the grounds that I had once worked for Penthouse -- not to mention the fact that we have been debating each other in various forums for the past five years . In keeping with our contentious history , she took a swipe at me in her book for continuing `` the Kinsey practice of euphemizing incest . '' My offense was using the biblical variant `` lying with a near relative '' in a 1977 article on the subject of incest . As a synonym for intercourse , `` lying with '' appears eight times in Genesis . Ed Eichel is a different story . Though seemingly obsessed by Kinsey like his coauthor , he was friendly in long conversations . He told me that he began to smell a big baised agenda in sexology when he was a student in New York University 's Human Sexuality program in the early '80s . `` It was literally a gay studies program for heterosexuals , '' he says . Around 1985 , Eichel came upon Reisman 's critique of Kinsey and the conspiracy theory started to sink in : the sex establishment was ruled by a Kinseyan bisexual bund advocating the overthrow of the heterosexual norm . No wonder he was having such a rough time promoting the joy of simultaneous orgasm -- anything that enhanced sexual compatibility between men and women inevitably raised objections . Eventually , Eichel exchanged philosophical fluids with Reisman , and from this union Kinsey , Sex and Fraud was born . Eichel 's main contribution to the book is discovery and analysis of a Kinsey conspiracy that supposedly seeks `` the establishment of bisexuality as the balanced sexual orientation for normal , uninhibited people '' which , by destroying the traditional family structure and normal sexual behavior , `` would open the way for the second and more difficult step -- the ultimate goal of cross-generational sex ( sex with children ) . '' When I pressed him for specific references to back up his outrageous contentions , he said weakly , `` You do n't think Kinsey is going to come right out and say that everybody is basically bisexual and should have sex with kids , but this is implicit in the Kinsey reports . '' Meanwhile , Eichel is demanding a congressional investigation of Kinsey and his data . Perfect . That 's just what the country needs -- a House Un-American Sexual Activities Committee , looking under beds and asking people if they are now or have everbeen a reader , a sympathizer or -- God forbid -- a subject of Dr. Alfred Kinsey .

To put it a little differently : - IRQ 7 is the de facto standard interrupt assigned to be used by the printer adapter to announce its completion of some activity . - DOS does n't monitor IRQ 7 ; it uses other means to determine when it's time to send out another byte to the printer . - Most ( all ? ) ( hardware ) printer adapters have the ability to disable the use of IRQ 7 , usually by merely breaking the connection between the ISA pin and the associated driver . Other adapters control the IRQ line by a tri-state driver , and by programming just leave it in the high-impedence mode . - Unfortunately , there are a lot of adapter cards which use bistate drivers ( i.e. , either assert high or assert low ) for the IRQ lines rather than tristate drivers ( assert high , assert low , or don't assert anything ) . The presence of such a card on an IRQ line precludes the use of that IRQ by any other adapter unless it is physically disconnected by a jumper . ( Incidentally , note that there 's no requirement that a card hold the IRQ line low when no interrupt is desired . If that were true you would have to somehow tie down all unconnected IRQ lines , and that certainly is n't a requirement . ) - Non-DOS operating systems ( OS/2 , NT ( ? ) , various Unices or whatever the proper plural of Unix might be ) require the use of IRQ 7 for performance reasons . And the SB16 , alas , is one of the cards which uses bistate drivers . Joe Morris / MITRE ( jcmorris @ mitre.org )

I would n't make that assumption ; I do n't think it is a > reasonable assumption . No . It follows from the fact that most Christians ' choice of interpretation stems from a mix of beliefs that are influenced by the secular ethics of their culture and that are not fully determined by scripture . Whether or not there is some `` right '' interpretation matters not ; few Christians claim the ability to read the mind of their god . Dave Davis should note that it was Michael who first stated the importance of secular and cultural influence in this thread . I think Michael is right in this , but regardless , it should be noted that this has *not* been a point of contention between Michael and myself . I have argued -- beyond Michael 's claims -- that the Christian scriptures are open to so many interpretations -- including a wide divergence within the Christian tradition -- that even their most important themes are vague . Again , it does not matter that there is some `` right '' interpretation *unless* there is a way to determine what that `` right '' interpretation is . It is the lack of an objective measure , not the presumed lack of an answer , that puts the force behind the line I argue . > Michael , and I , and others , read 'the Bible ' with Christian > glasses .

The equation of radical = > liberal , which seems implied by Russell Turpin is wrong . ... In my opinion , what makes Michael radical is that he fully acknowledges that Christian scripture and tradition fail to determine the doctrines that so many branches within Christianity hold dear . He is willing to live and practice his religion within this indeterminacy , and he is willing to acknowledge that much of his understanding of things Christian is influenced by ideas that are not purely Christian . Those Christians I have called conservative must also interpret , but they do not recognize -- or at least , are unwilling to admit -- the extent and importance of this . > Russell Turpin ( in an earlier post ) had said that Michael ( Michael's > theological positions , actually ) did n't tell him much about Christianity ; > Dean Simeon responds ( this time gently ) : 'What do you mean ?

A surprising logical ellipsis . I think the conclusion does follow . The purely Christian principles that Michael has are the ones he shares with others in the Christian tradition or that can be derived from Christian scripture . These , necessarily vague , are not enough to drive his political stances . That one should love one 's neighbor is a purely Christian principle .

From : higgins @ fnalf.fnal.gov ( Bill Higgins -- Beam Jockey ) Subject : The Dream Machines : book on vaporware spacecraft Organization : Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory Lines : 133 NNTP-Posting-Host : fnalf.fnal.gov Summary : Ron Miller book on history of spaceships from Krieger Publishing Keywords : spaceships spacecraft astronautics history SF Miller Ron Miller is a space artist with a long and distinguished career . I 've admired both his paintings ( remember the USPS Solar System Exploration Stamps last year ? ) and his writings on the history of spaceflight . For several years he 's been working on a *big* project which is almost ready to hit the streets . A brochure from his publisher has landed in my mailbox , and I thought it was cool enough to type in part of it ( it 's rather long ) . Especially given the Net's strong interest in vaporware spacecraft ... ================================== The Dream Machines : An Illustrated History of the Spaceship in Art , Science , and Literature By Ron Miller with Foreword by Arthur C. Clarke Krieger Publishing Company Melbourne , Florida , USA Orig . Ed . 1993 Pre-publication $ 84.50 ISBN 0-89464-039-9 This text is a history of the spaceship as both a cultural and a technological phenomenon . The idea of a vehicle for traversing the space betwen worlds did not spring full-blown into existence in the tlatter half of theis century . The need preceded the ability ot make such a device by several hundred years . As soon as it was realized that there were other worlds than this one , human beings wanted to reach them . Tracing the history of the many imaginative , and often prescient , attempts to solve this problem also reflects the history of technology , science , astronomy , and engineering . Once space travel became feasible , there were many more spacecraft concepts developed than ever got off the drawing board -- or off the ground , for that matter . These also are described in theis book , for the same reason as the pre-space-age and pre-flight ideas are : they are all accurate reflections of their particular era 's dreams , abilities , and knowledge . Virtually every spaceship concept invented since 1500 , as well as selected events important in developing the idea of extraterrestrial travel , is listed chronologically . The chronological entries allow comparisons between actual astronautical events and speculative ventures . They also allow comparisons between simultaneous events taking place in different countries . They reveal connections , influences , and evolutions hitherto unsuspected . Every entry is accompanied by at least one illustration . Nearly every spacecraft concept is illustrated with a schematic drawing . This allows accurate comparisons to be made between designss , to visualize differences , similarities , and influences . This text will be of interest to students of astronautical history , and also to model builders who would be interested in the schematic diagrams . Science fiction fans as well as aviation history buffs and historians of science will also find this book to be fascinating . The unique collection of illustrations makes it a visually attractive and very interesting history of the spaceship . SPECIAL FEATURES Includes scale drawings of several hundred spacecraft , both real and fictional Contains scores of illustrations : artwork , drawings , and photos contemporary with the subject . This includes extremely rare illustrations from scarce books and novels , exclusive photos and drawings fromSoviet spacecraft ; rare stills from both famous and obscure science fiction films , and unpublished photographs from NASA archives An index , bibliography , and appendices are included . CONTENTS Part I The Archaeology of the Spaceship ( 360 B.C . to 1783 A.D. ) Part II The invention of the Spaceship ( 1784-1899 ) Part III The Experimenters ( 1900-1938 ) Part IV The World War ( 1939-1945 ) Part V The Golden Age of the Spaceship ( 1946-1960 ) Part VI The Dawn of the Space Age ( 1961 to the present ) ABOUT RON MILLER [ The brochure has a page of stuff here ; I 'll try to hit the high spots . ] Former art director for Albert Einstein Planetarium at Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum Member of International Association for Astronomical Arts , member of International Astronautical Association , Fellow of the British Interplanetary Society , consulting editor for *Air & Space Smithsonian* magazine Author , co-author , editor , or sole illustrator on many books since 1979 , including *Space Art* , *Cycles of Fire* , *The Grand Tour* , and many others , as well as many articles and papers Book jackets and interior art for over a dozen publishers Contributor to IBM traveling exhibition and book *Blueprint for Space* Production illustrator for movies *Dune* and *Total Recall* Designer of ten-stamp set of commemorative space postage stamps for U.S .

I 'm just getting started with this type of activity , so please set your flame-thowers on low . Comments , corrections , suggestions , welcomed . **************************************************************************** Editor , I would like to ask you and your readers a few questions that are related to the `` right to keep and bear arms '' , and to a greater degree , the many other '' rights '' that we take for granted on a daily basis . 1 . You 're sleeping at night , when you hear someone in your house . You call the police . How will you defend yourself , should the need arise , while you are waiting for the police to arive ? 2 . You are driving your family home when your car breaks down . A `` good samaritan '' stops to `` help '' , when you find you and your family at gun-point or knife-point . How will you defend yourself ? And your Family ? 3 . You are a woman walking alone to your car or home . A man appears suddenly with the intent to rape you . How will you defend yourself ? Are you strong enough to fight off your attacker ? Are you willing to let this man rape you in order to survive the attack ? If the House and Senate have their way , we will soon not have the right to keep and bear arms , as provided by the Second Amendment to the Constitution . A gun may not be the answer to each and every dangerous situation , but are you going to let the politicians decide what sort of force or weapon you may use to defend yourself and your family ? Many times a situation may be diffused by just brandishing your handgun . If certain members of the House and Senate have their way , .25 , .32 , and 9mm ammunition will be banned for sale to anyone other than the military and law enforcement departments . Very soon , you may not be able to purchase ammunition for use in your handgun . There is already a 15 day waiting period in California . Do you really feel that any law abiding citizen should be required to wait this amount of time for the purchase of a handgun when his life or family members have been threatened ? Our local police do an excellent job , but they can not be there all the time , or in a moments notice . You should have the right to protect yourself while waiting for help to arrive . There is currently legislation circulating in Washington that would prohibit the sale of certain types of ammuntion , handguns , rifles , and shot-guns . One elected official even wants to repeal the Second Amendment ! I want to ask the readers of this paper what they would do if their elected officials decided that they should only belong to a `` certain church '' , or go to church on a `` partiular day '' ? What if you were told that you could only read certain books ? Write about certain subjects ? What if you no longer had the right to a jury of your peers ? How about the right to assemble in a peaceful manner ? These are all rights that are provided by our Constitution and the Amendments . If we give up one right , we may as well give them all up . If you do not fight for the right to keep and bear arms , what will you fight for ? When your life is affected ? Write your law makers now ! Protect all of your rights by defending your Second Amendment rights .

Hmmmmm ... . > There is a correclation between warm-running amps and good sound , or in your words , `` it DOES have a bearing on ... . '' . Now , I do n't suggest that everyone run out and create combination stove/amplifiers that will degrade lifespan , but a cold-running circuit is much more suceptible to temperature variation with varrying current than is a warm-running one . And since junction resistance is a function of temperature , this has a detrimental effect on linearity . a few facts : -bias points vary with temperature -junction resist varrie with temp -Adcom products do NOT run class-A If you still do n't beleive this assertion , consider the warm-up requirements for most good test equipment , or better yet , just listen to an amplifier warm-up . On many designs its quite audible , on mine , about 20 minutes for the output stage , many hours for the drivers . Fortunately the drivers are not switched . In any experiment , or when drawing conclusions from listening , betcareful to seperate the effect of device temperature from bias ( idle current ) level . Both have a positive correlation with low distortion and `` good '' sound quality , and high bias results in warmer operation , all other factors being equal . Grant

Even if we assume that these `` trusted agents '' are really entering a wide range of S1 and S2 seeds ( rather than using the same one all the time to reduce the key search space to 30 bits ) , I assume they are not doing so by picking up an iron filing and poking it into the circuitry at carefully selected points to encode data .

From : rstimets @ silver.ucs.indiana.edu ( robert and stimets ) Subject : Belcher terrific ; Tomlin not ; Reds win 5-0 : RedReport 4-20 Nntp-Posting-Host : silver.ucs.indiana.edu Organization : Indiana University Lines : 154 Tim Belcher pitched a dandy three-hit shut-out tonight as Cincinnati won their second straight 5-0 . Pittsburgh Lefty Randy Tomlin was hit early and often by the heavily right-unbalanced Reds line-up , which managed some recently rare power with their bats . Belcher ( 1-1 ) was solid throughout and in fact seemed to get stronger as the game progressed . Early on he had several three-ball counts , but even those were few and far between later on as he allowed only one base-on-balls while striking out nine . In a post game interview he said his change-up was working for him -- I should say so : all nine of his strikeouts were apparently on breaking balls . Tomlin ( 0-1 ) , on the other hand was in trouble early , giving up a second-pitch double to lead-off batter Bip Roberts . Bobby Kelly followed with a single and Barry Larkin scored Roberts with a sharp single to right . The big guys ( Mitchell , Sabo , Milligan ) were unable to get anything after that -- in fact they all struck out -- but Kelly managed a score anyway due to a double-steal and a Tomlin wild pitch . In fact , it appeared that Tomlin was going to recover nicely from his shaky start -- he retired 9 of the next 11 batters to get to the fourth behind only 2-0 . Randy Milligan , though , had different ideas as his line-shot was poorly played by Orlando Merced and turned into a triple . Milligan would later score on Reggie Sanders ' sacrifice fly , giving Cinci the 3-0 lead after 4 . The fifth inning spelled loss for Tomlin when Roberts led off with his second double of the game , and one batter later Larkin smacked a double down the left field line , chasing Tomlin . Barry later would score the final run on Tom Prince 's two-base passed ball . The Pirates managed their only threat of the day in the bottom half of the fifth when Merced and Kevin Young hit back-to-back singles ( the second being of the `` bunt '' variety ) , but Carlos Garcia struck out , Prince fit a foul fly , and pinch-hitter Lonnie Smith `` K 'd '' to end any Pittsburgh hope . Pittsburgh pitchers backed Tomlin up well , though : relievers Blas Minor , Moeller ( sp ? ) , and Nagel gave up only two hits in their four-plus innings work . Barry Larkin left the game in the seventh when the grounder he ( mis ) played bruised his right thumb . He was taken to the hospital for `` precautionary X-rays '' . Let 's hope he 's OK. Cincinnati is now 4-9 , still the worst record in the majors , but with the two wins they may be looking at moving out of the cellar ! Pittsburgh is now 7-6 . *********REDS FANS*************************** If you would like to receive this report on a semi-daily basis ( as often as I write it ) , send me your e-mail address and I 'll put you on the list .

If the person or company distributing PGP receives money for doing so , then it is clearly a sale ( for example , if it were on Compuserve , they charge you for access so they would be selling PGP ) . When there is no charge for PGP things get less clear , but there would still be a reasonable view that it is inducing an infringement . > ...

This is a common misconception . The patent laws do not mention any valid purpose for infringing a patent . Although it is clear that in order to create a new invention either based on a prior patent or to avoid infringing a prior patent , one must perform research on an existing patent . To just say that you infringed a patent ( assume we 're not talking the RSA patent ) only for research purposes ( wink wink , nudge nudge ) and then never develop any related invention ( ie . only use it ) , would be a clear infringement . -- Glenn Tenney voice : ( 415 ) 574-3420 fax : ( 415 ) 574-0546 tenney @ netcom.com Ham radio : AA6ER

I have had > a quick look in the computer graphics literature with no results . > Perhaps someone who has access to medical information could help ? Certainly . Reference follows . Bear in mind that there are at least two conditions which may be called red/green colour blind . One , protanopia , is caused by a lack or major dysfunction of the L cones , those that respond best to long wavelengths . This gives much reduced red/green and red/violet discrimination and also means that reds look dimmer than than they do to people with normal vision . The other , deuteranopia , is due to missing or dysfunctional M cones although it can also be caused by a lack of the L-M cone difference signals in the retina . It also gives reduced red/green discrimination but red/violet is unaffected . Unlike protanopia , reds are not dimmer than normal . On a uniform chromaticity diagram - the horseshoe shaped one you see in computer graphics books - there is a single confusion point for each type of colour deficiency . Colours which are confused lie on straight lines radiating from this point . For protanopia the point is at u'=0.61 , v'=0.51 , very close to the far red corner . For deuteranopia , the point is at u'=-4.75 , v'=1.31 Note that different experimental investigations in the literature give slightly different values for these depending on the precise details of the experimental setup , random errors , and so on . The values quoted are typical . So if all colours on a line are seen as the same , which colour is actually seen ? This problem has now been solved . Tests on people with one normal eye and one affected eye have shown that there is an axis for each type of disorder onto which all the colours collapse . For protanopes this joins up 473nm and 574nm on the spectral locus ( the edge of the horseshoe ) ; for deuteranopes the line is very similar , joining 477nm and 579nm . *So* to convert colours from normal vision to a simulated protanopia or duuteranopia : 1 ) Plot the colour on a uniform chromaticity diagram 2 ) Construct a line from this point to the appropriate confusion point 3 ) Find the intersection of this line with the appropriate axis line 4 ) This is the new chromaticity . The best reference for this is Meyer , G.W . & Greenberg , D.P . ( 1988 ) 'Colour defective vision and computer graphics displays ' , IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications 8 ( 5 ) 28-40 . You will also need a decent reference on basic colour science if you are not familiar with the CIE XYZ colour model and the uniform chromaticity scale diagram . > I would like to write a program ( probably a PPM filter ) to allow > previewing of images to check for sufficient contract for colour > blind users . Not being colour blind myself , this is a bit difficult ! Yes this is certainly possible . You will need the chromaticities of the red green and blue phosphors of the monitor you intend to display the images on , and the chromaticity of the white point . This information can be measured , or obtained from the manufacturer . I posted a list of some monitor chromaticities a couple of weeks ago . The procedure , for each pixel ( ! ) is as follows . ( Some lookup tables might be a help here . ) A ) convert RGB to CIE XYZ . This is a simple 3*3 matrix multiplication once you have the monitor data . B ) retaining the Y component for later , convert XYZ to chromaticity coordinates u ' v' using u ' = 4X/ ( X+15Y+3Z ) , v ' = 9Y/ ( X+15Y+3Z ) C ) find the equation of the line as in step 2 above D ) find the intersection as in step 3 E ) convert back from u ' v ' to XYZ , using the Y value from step A F ) Ensure that this new colour can be displayed on your monitor ; if not , move it along a line in XYZ space towards neutral grey ( ie half way between black and white ) until it is displayable . > Please email replies - I will summarise and repost if there is > sufficient interest Done ; also posted for the rest of us . -- Chris Lilley -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Technical Author , ITTI Computer Graphics and Visualisation Training Project Computer Graphics Unit , Manchester Computing Centre , Oxford Road , Manchester , UK .

Well 48 bit colour *could* be for improved resolution but 16 bits per channel seems like a bit excessive . I have seen a paper that quoted 10 bits per channel of 12 bits for computational precision . More than that would seem to be wasted . Perhaps the frame buffer uses another colourspace which needs more bits to represent the full range - RGB is a cube so it is a compact encoding . Most likely however is that there are two separate 24 bit ( 8 bits per component ) frame buffers . This set up , called double buffering , allows a complex 3d picture to be built up on one buffer while the other buffer ( containing the previous frame ) is displayed . This makes for smoother animation . > ( sadly , I have access to none of them . Just a DEC 5000/25 . Sigh . ) Well hey if you want to brag about numbers , the 5000 range can take a PXG Turbo+ card with 96 bits per pixel . Full double buffering ( Two 24 bit buffers ) , a 24 bit Z buffer and an extra 24 bit buffer for off screen image storage .

You have to run up the window heirarchy ( using XQueryTree ( ) ) until you get to the root window . Now , this is not so simple because some window managers slap a window over the root window that is the same size as the root window , so be sure to take that into account for further calculations . Calculate the position and width/height offsets for each window using XGetGeometry ( ) . BE SURE TO TAKE THE BORDER_WIDTH INTO CONSIDERATION . Remember a windows border_width IS ON THE OUTSIDE of a window , so the windows x , y , width , height must be adjusted accordingly . All of this should give you pretty good numbers for how much space the window-manager is using . Now , to place the new window , you have to use the same numbers to calculate where you want to place it , because the window-manager will re-parent it on the OUTSIDE of where you place your window ( if I remember correctly ) . DISCLAIMER : All of this is from memory , and I no longer have the code . But I did get it working under several window managers correctly .

Some think they are infallible , others think otherwise .

Yes . I think that , for example , only a vanishingly small number of people would hold that there 's a frame of reference in which gassing six million Jews is good .

I do actually quote some things that Roger Meynard wrote , but it might be better to think of this as '' sampling '' his post ( in the hip-hop sense ) because it fits in with what I want to say . maynard @ ramsey.cs.laurentian.ca ( Roger Maynard ) writes : > But the point is that the only decision making pro- > cess used to determine the `` best '' is the score of the game and it re- > lates to the *teams* . Not the individual players . There is no method > inherent in baseball of comparing individual performances . And that > is how it should be , because , after all , baseball is a team game . There 's an interesting parallel between this way of viewing a baseball team and some people 's conception of a biological organism . In the biology context , we would very likely read `` fitness '' for `` the score of the game '' and `` organisms '' for `` teams '' . How we interpret `` players '' is trickier , but either `` organs '' , or `` genes '' might seem reasonable choices depending on what point we were trying to make . A `` genes '' interpretation actually might be really interesting in this case , but that would be a different and probably longer post . If , however , we take the `` organ '' view , then our knowledge of biology should make us pause before we start saying things like `` species X is more fit than species Y because of a better organ Z '' . Given what we know about the interdependence of organs , we would often be suspicious of such claims . ( But note that this type of argument is quite often made when you map `` species X '' onto 'humans ' , and `` organ Z '' onto 'brain ' ) . On the other hand , some statements of this kind do seem more reasonable than others , as far as we can test them ( e.g . 'brain' above might be more reasonable than 'pancreas ' assuming no gross pathology , particularly if species Y is a primate ) . Even when you make such statements , you should be concerned with the functioning of the whole organism , and the possibility that one organ might be more crucial for one species and a second organ in another . ( Not to mention the possibility that no organ is particularly crucial in some third species . ) However , if we are non-vitalists with any kind of reductionsit streak , we will want to say that an organism is not some completely magical unanalyzable `` whole '' but an intriguing process made up of various subprocesses that interact in ways that are potentially observable . Some of these processes might be localized to particular organs , while others may be distributed across multiple organs . In a way , this is just like a baseball team , except that I think it is pretty clear that the processes and interactions involved in baseball are *much* simpler and less numerous than in most organisms . > To say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab- > solutely that player A 's team would have played better with player B > in their lineup . Sheer speculation . Impossible to ascertain . One thing that is quite difficult about baseball is that perfectly controlled experiments are sometimes very tough to do . But , of course , this has never stopped researchers from doing the best they can , and sometimes deriving very powerful conclusions even in the absence of certainty . Most of this goes far beyond sheer speculation , but even sheer speculation can motivate further interesting research . > If you want to select a group of statistics and claim that Clemens > has done better [ than another pitcher ] with those statistics as a > criteria , then fine . In this cases , we 're seeing the word `` statistics '' means `` summary of observed events '' , where the events themselves can be viewed as the output of some process , and possibly inputs for other processes . Thus , if we have any valid notion of how the processes are put together into the functioning organism , data in the form of statistics might give us a basis to test particular hypotheses . > But you have to be able to prove that those statistics measure the > individual 's contribution to winning the WS - because that is the only > measure of `` best '' that has any meaning in the context of baseball . This statement brings us back to the concept of fitness again . Fitness is defined in terms of both an organism and its environment ; you might be fit in one situation and not another . Moving to baseball , it is clear that each team spends the entire season in an environment including all the other teams in the league . In at least a nominal sense , the division winners are the fittest teams in the league , in that they ( on average ) had better fitness scores than any of their competing opponennts . But in a real sense , there is a fairly large random component in the performance of each team that is difficult if not impossible to account for in terms of factors intrinsic to ( or interesting for ) baseball . The same is true in biology . But here is also no direct biological equivalent of the World Series in basebal . In the world series , the random component may be greatly magnified by the small number of games that are played , and both teams suddenly experience huge changes from the environement where they were originally successful . It might be fun to watch , but it 's unclear what it all really means . *** Now just one more un-related point : > I have yet to see that any of you can predict a > WS winner with any greater accuracy than Jeanne Dixon . On the other hand , you have seen some of us who can predict the outcome of the divisional races better than a random assignment of teams to finishes , and maybe some of us ( e.g . me ) who can do this better than the other participants in this forum on a regular basis . But this is probably only due to the fact that a 162-game schedule gives you a little hope that bad hops are n't the only difference between the winners and the losers . Moreover , you 've had the opportunity to see some analysis of the World Series situation that makes the strong claim that *nobody* can predict the WS winner with reliably greater accuracy than a coin biased only to reflect the well-known home vs. road effect on winning percentage . > The stats are a nice hobby and that 's about it . There is no new > knowledge being produced . Since stats are summaries of events , it 's true that if you know the events you can derive the stats . But if somebody is trying to understand the process behind the stats , then the stats produce new knowledge , and some of this might even be reliable , repeatable , and useful . Speaking of which , I should get back to producing knowledge in a different field . That is , of course , if I can produce knowledge even though I 'm relying on stats to do it . jking

Organization : University of California , Berkeley Lines : 32 Distribution : world NNTP-Posting-Host : uclink.berkeley.edu Jim Haynes wants to know the following is a scam ... . There 's a chiropractor who has a stand in the middle of a shopping mall , offering free examinations . Part of the process involves a multiple-jointed sensor arm and a computer that says in a computer- sounding voice `` digitize left PSIS '' `` digitize right PSIS '' `` digitize C7 '' `` please stand with spine in neutral position '' . I 'm wondering whether this does n't really measure anything and the computer voice is to impress the victims , or whether it is measuring something that chiropractors think is useful to measure . Earth to sci.med ... .If it looks like a duck ... and quacks like a duck ... ... This is a TOTAL scam . Since the beginning of chiropraxis , the chiropractor has tried to sell The Subluxation as The Problem and then sell themselves and their Adjustments as The Solution . The Chiropractic Subluxation is a delusional diagnosis and the Adjustments of Subluxations by extension constitute a delusional medicine . The wide spectrum of chiropractic Techniques ALL have their own methods for detecting Spinal Demons and unique methodolgies for Excorcizing Them . The computer approach is an attempt to 'sell with science ' but this device is nothing more than a 'high-tech ' Subluxation Detector ... ..and in the end ... AMAZINGLY ... it will show the potential 'patient ' to suffer from ... VS ... ... Vertebral Subluxation ... .The Silent Killer ! John Badanes , DC , CA romdas @ uclink.berkeley.edu

Nntp-Posting-Host : ra.msstate.edu Organization : Mississippi State University Lines : 45 In light of the last letter I posted from Jeff Brody concering the crap that is going on in the MOA , ( which some folks took not as dissemination of information that I received , but as my own bad mouthing ) I thought that I would post this one , which came to me yesterday . This is from board member Robert Higdon to MOA Pres Chich Morse . This is NOT my words , O.K . guys ? April 4 , 1993 re : Cecil King 's Nominating Statement Dear Chick : We have a very serious problem with the election for president of the MOA this year . Cecil King 's nominating statement ( as it appeared in the Owners News ) is 968 words , nearly twice as many as that is permitted by the by-laws . In pertinent part , the rules state : '' Each candidate 's biography and position statement shall be limited to a combined total of no more than 500 words . The nominating committe shall cut afafter the 500th word any biography and position statement exceeding this length . Obviously the nominationg committe was not up to the task . Had Cecil's statement been cut as required , it would have concluded approximately with the word `` undertiding '' [ sic ] in the second paragraph after the commencement of his Position Statement . As a result , Cecil has obtained what I view as a grossly unfair advantage over the other candidates for president . This does not just taint the election for that office ; it makes a mockery of the process . I would appreciate your advising the board immediately what steps you intend to take to rectify this caricature of a fair election . Parenthetically , in your private correspondence with others , I would be most appreciative that when tou call me an `` asshole '' you remind the letter 's recipient that the re-publication of such a comment is almost guaranteed to have woeful consequences . With kind regards , I remain , Robert Higdon O.K . MOA'ers , You read it , think for yourself , I trust you do know who Cecil King is , and that he was Editor befor Don Douglass , and he is a pres . candidate . I let you draw your own conclusions .

As far as coaching goes , a Pens/Islanders match-up should be pretty good . One guy I feel sorry for in all of this so far is Chris Terreri . I 'm sure Tom Barrasso knows how he feels . For so long Tommy would look up and not have a teammate in sight . Terreri 's teammates really left him out in the cold in the first two games . Mom .

From : wdempsey @ athena.mit.edu ( Wayne R Dempsey ) Subject : Computer Equipment Garage Sale ! ! ! Organization : Massachusetts Institute of Technology Lines : 124 Distribution : usa NNTP-Posting-Host : venus.mit.edu Computer Equipment Garage Sale : I 've finally decided to clean out my closets and get rid of some of the stuff that is broken or not being used by me . I 've put together a list and indicated what I think each item is worth . This is just my estimate , and I am very open to any offers , including trades . I 'm currently looking for some CD-ROMs that will work with a Mac CD ROM player CD Caddies , HD floppy disks , any used Macintosh software , a 387-33Mhz Co-Processor , or basically anything you have lying around ( cans of soup , the neighbor 's cat , etc ... ) Make me an offer , no offer will be overlooked ... I really want to get rid of this stuff ... Ok , Here 's the list : 52 Meg 3.5 '' SCSI Hard Drive . Conner Model # CP-3150 . I bought this from a guy at a swap meet to use with my Macintosh . Unfortunately , I ca n't seem to get it to work with the SCSI controller in my computer . The guy tested it with his PC , and printed out a copy of the Norton Disk Doctor report which says it has no bad sectors . ( I 'll send you a copy ) I was dumb enough not to get his phone number , so I ca n't return it to him . The drive has many jumpers on it , ( which I do n't know how to set ) so maybe that 's the problem . I was quite disappointed that it didn't work so I 'm trying to minimize my losses . ~ $ 45 52 Meg 3.5 '' SCSI Hard Drive . Conner Model # CP-3150 . Same situation as above . I bought both of these drives from the same guy . Despite the different model numbers they are the same exact drive . Same report from NDD ( I have one for each drive ) will be included . ~ $ 45 40 Meg SONY 3.5 '' SCSI Hard Drive . SONY Model # SRD2040A . The drive mechanism is completely trashed . This hard drive was in my computer ( Mac SE ) and had a stiction problem . Well , repeated banging on the side of the computer resulted in a head crash ( yes , metal scraping metal ) which was not too pleasant to listen to . Still the SCSI controller card is in good working order , and can be used for parts , or a project . ~ $ 20 65 Meg Seagate 5.25 '' HH SCSI Hard Drive . Model # ST-277N . I originally bought this drive , because it had a small stiction problem , and I though that I could fix it . Well I determined that the drive mechanism was fine , and that it was a controller problem . ( motor controller was n't sending proper signals . ) Well , after taking the controller off the drive , looking at it , and putting it back together , I realized that I accidentally severed one of the small flat cables that connect the drive to the controller . I tried to solder it , but I 'm not that good at soldering so I could n't do it . Worked perfectly before I messed up . I used it as a temporary drive when the SONY ( above ) crashed on me . Also loaded the drive with about twenty Mac applications , worth well over $ 1000 . ( Claris CAD , MS Word 5.0 , Think C , Excel , and many others ) I think all it needs is a resoldering of that cable . You also get all the software on the drive . ( if you can accept being a pirate ) I only ask that you delete my data files from the drive . I was really angry when I broke that connection , and then could n't fix it . I just do n't have time to play with it any more . ~ $ 65 AT & T ISDN 7500 Modem . This is for use on digital phone systems . If you know what this is or would like technical information on it , let me know . I have some tech documents on it . Is supposed to be the same thing as an AT & T digital phone , but without the phone part . It seems to be in working order ( passes self test perfectly OK ) . I have no idea how this is worth ... Let me know if you 're interested . Motorola 68881 CoProcessor . I have n't tested this one out yet , but if anyone is interested I will get it tested out , to make sure that it works .

From : mg @ cs.princeton.edu ( Michael Golan ) Subject : clipper serial numbers need 2nd court order ? Originator : news @ nimaster Nntp-Posting-Host : atomic.princeton.edu Organization : Princeton University Lines : 28 something that no one has discussed yet ( or I missed it ) : The FBI sets up a wiretap AFTER the court order was handed . Only at this point they can access the line and detect the serial number N. What happens next , does the FBI simply asks for the keys for N , and , since a warrant was issued for the line , the FBI simply gets it ? What if multiple phones are used from the same house , the FBI just asks for N1 , N2 , etc. ? Exactly who is to prevent the FBI from claiming some other serial number , X , was also used over the wirtapped line and get the keys for X ? Either a second court order ( for the specific serial/key ) is required ( and I have seen no indication of this ) , or the FBI can effectively ask for any pair of keys at any time , so the escrow key holders are a total fake . An unrelated issue : if and when all phones always use the clipper chip , how are call-transfers going to take place ? ! Michael Golan mg @ cs.princeton.edu

Well , as I remember Jacoby 's `` Mythmaker '' talks about this to cite one source -- but I 'm not sure if all Christians have read this book . In addition my social experiences is from being raised and educated as a Lutheran , having a lot of Christian friends , and I even have played in two Christian rock bands !

Hard braking and swerving tend to be mutually exclusive > manouvres - did Hurt draw any conclusions on which one is generally preferable ? Apparently the instinct to brake in the face of danger is n't as strong as the instinct to freeze up and do nothing in the face of danger . Hurt found that a surprising number of accident-involved motorcyclists hadn't used their brakes at all prior to impact . I think the only way you 'll ever use countersteering reliably and correctly in a crisis is to make it the only conscious method of directional control you ever use , and to practice it constantly , even when you have no need to do any turning . If you follow me down a long straight , and I seem to be wiggling back and forth randomly or suddenly without obvious need , it 's because I 'm practicing countersteering and avoiding imaginary obstacles directly in my path . All of this practice may indeed be futile , but if I have even milliseconds to react , the most *familiar* tactic available ( and hopefully the most automatic ) will be countersteering . The same logic applies to braking with the front brake , of course . Chuck Rogers car377 @ torreys.att.com

What 's despicable is that this sordid incident is being glommed onto by all sorts of people desperately trying to `` get a revolution . '' It makes '' ambulance chasing '' by lawyers seem like a harmless pastime . For the last few months , benighted souls have been calling C-SPAN on issues as mundane as budget resolutions , saying that `` I do n't know , I just have the feeling there is going to be a revolution in this country , '' and so on . Get real ! For a real case study in revolution , go to Blockbuster Video and check out `` Underground , '' a film made about the Weather Underground in the 70 's . Even with all the strife back then , the `` revolution '' never did come . And Waco is supposed to be the spark of the end times ? In the tape , it is interesting to see the way the Weatherpersons dance around the issue of one of their defining moments , which was when a few of their comrades managed to blow themselves up manufacturing bombs in a Greenwich village townhouse . The problem , one of them said , was that they were so caught up in their armed struggle that they *forgot* about their own personal safety and were n't `` careful . '' But of course that was *society's* fault , a society that did n't instill a sense of worth in the people , so they neglect their own safety .

STAY CALM AND DO NOT PANIC Your natural reaction once you realize what has just occurred is to panic . But to do so is absolutely useless now . If you had wanted to get right with God before the rapture , you could have , but you chose to wait . Now your only chance is to stay on this earth and to endure to the end of the Tribulation . `` But he that shall endure unto the end , the same shall be saved . '' - Matthew 24:13 II . REALIZE YOU ARE NOW LIVING DURING THE GREAT TRIBULATION The Great Tribulation is a seven year period starting from the time of the rapture until Christ 's second coming . Also know as `` the time of Jacob's ( Israel 's ) trouble '' ( Jere 30:7 ) and `` Daniel 's Seventieth Week '' ( Dan 9 ) , this period will be unparalleled in trouble and horror . III . GATHER AS MANY BIBLES AS YOU CAN AND HIDE THEM Soon after the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community ( the revived Roman Empire ) , Bibles will be confiscated and owning a Bible will be tantamount to treason . The Bible , however , will be your most valuable possession during the Tribulation . IV . READ THE BIBLE LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER READ IT BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE Since all of your Bibles may be confiscated , even if you are careful , it is imperative that you read the Word until you memorize whole passages and can quote them . It is especially important to read Daniel , Luke 21 , Matthew 24 , Revelation , and Amos , for these books describe the events you can expect to unfold before you . V. PRAY LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER PRAYED BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE Pray until the power of God comes strongly upon you - pray and pray and pray . Only by reading the Word and praying will you gain the spiritual strength to be able to withstand the torture you may have to endure for the sake of Christ . VI . DO NOT TAKE THE MARK AT ANY COST - EVEN IN FIT MEANS YOU AND YOUR LOVED ONES DIE AS MARTYRS After the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community , he will institute a world economic system , designed so that you can not buy , sell , or eat unless you take his mark or the number of his name . Money will be useless . `` And he causes all , both small and great , rich and poor , free and slave , to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads , and that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast , or the number of his name . Here is wisdom . Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast , for it is the number of a man : His number is 666 '' - Revelation 13:16-18 . The Antichrist will implement the greatest slaughter in all of humanity . Think of the various ways people have been tortured and killed in the past , such as the Holocaust . [ or maybe the crusades ? -M ] You can not even imagine the horror that will take place under the Antichrist's rule ; it will be much worse than anything in history ( Matt 24:21 ) `` ... I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held . And a white robe was given to each of them : and it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer , until both the number of the fellow servants and their brethren , who would be killed as they were , was completed . '' Revelation 6:9 , 11 . His targets will be Jews and Christians who do not worship his image or take the mark on their forehead or right hadn/ `` ... And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus and for the word of God , who had not worshiped the beast or his image , and had not received his mark on their foreheads or on the hands . '' - Revelation 20:4 . He will use every form of torture and humiliation in order to force you to renounce Christ . Nor will he hesitate to use your loved ones against you , even your children , torturing and killing them in front of you so that you will be tempted to take the mark . If you take the mark or worship the Antichrist or his image , however , you will be consigned to the second death , which is the Lake of Fire . [ Sung about so eloquently by Johnny Cash ... -M ] You can not be redeemed . It is better to endure torture for a short while and gain eternal life then [ sic ] to endure eternal torment in the Ring^H^H^H^H Lake of Fire . `` ... If anyone worships the Beast and his image , and receives his mark on his forehead or on his hand , he himself shall also drink the wine of the wrath of God , which is poured out full strength into the cup of His indignation . An [ sic ] he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb . '' -Revelation 14:9-10 [ and probably in the presence of season-ticket holders ; special hats given to the first 5,000 at the stadium -- M ] VII . SET A PLAN IN MOTION FOR SURVIVAL Although you may not be able to hide from the Antichrist 's government until the end of the Tribulation , all of the time you gain in hiding is important for your spiritual growth and strengthening , since only those who are extremely strong in Christ can suffer and die for His sake . The first thing to do is move out of the city and into a rural or mountainous area , for the Antichrist 's control will come last to the least populated areas . Take a good radio or TV with you so that you can stay attuned to events and discern the time schedule of the Tribulation . [ `` As you can see on the weather map , heavy currents of Tribulation will sweep into our area by daybreak . Expect delays on I-95 outbound , and perhaps school closings '' -- M ] Store water and food , because you will not be able to purchase anything without the mark . Water in lakes and streams will be polluted by radioactive waste from nuclear warfare and will eventually turn into blood . [ Get a good water filter . -- M ] Bring different types of clothing for all seasons , as well as flashlights , batteries , generators , and First Aid supplies . In short , learn how to survive and live off the land as the pioneers did . VIII . TRUST NO ONE There will be secret agents everywhere , spying for the Antichrist's government . Be on the lookout . [ Perot supporters take note -- M ] IX . WATCH FOR THE ANTICHRIST It is important to realize who the Antichrist is and what he is up to , for he will deceive many into thinking that he is a great world leader who will bring peace and prosperity to a world hungry for it . We can infer from Daniel 11 certain characteristics of this man . Popular during the first three and a half years of the Tribulation , he will dominate the airwaves . He will be physically appealing , highly intelligent , with Christ-like charisma and personality . An international politician , military tactician and economic expert , his word will be peace ; he will make a treaty with the Jews , which he will break after three and a half years . He will have such supernatural power that a mortal wound to his head will be healed . Even the very elect will be deceived . If you do not pray and read the Bible , you too will be deceived . [ Dominate the airwaves ? Perhaps Howard Stern or Rush Limbaugh ... -M ] The antichrist will have a companion , the False Prohphet [ sic ] , who will make an image in the likeness of the Antichrist and cause it to speak . All who refuse to worhsip [ sic ] the image will be killed . The final three and a half years will be absolutely insane , with demonized spirits everywhere . X . DO NOT GIVE UP HOPE ! The seven years of Tribulation will end with the triumphant return of Christ . The Antichrist will be defeated . Be steadfast and endure , and you will be rewarded greatly in Heaven . Start reading the Bible and praying fervently now . The salvation of your sould depends upon it . Determine that , come what may , you will not take the mark or worship the Antichrist . You still have a chance to be saved or remain saved , but this time you will have to be `` faithful unto death .

From : hanson @ kronos.arc.nasa.gov ( Robin Hanson ) Subject : Estimating Wiretap Costs/Benefits Nntp-Posting-Host : jabberwock.arc.nasa.gov Organization : NASA/ARC Information Sciences Division Lines : 166 WOULD WIRETAP CHIP BE COST-EFFECTIVE ? by Robin Hanson Draft , April 21 , 1993 SUMMARY : Compared to an average monthly phone bill of sixty dollars , wiretaps are only worth two cents a month to police . So the proposed wiretap chip must raise phone costs by less than one part in three thousand to be cost-effective . BACKGROUND Until now , phones have happened to allow the existence of `` wiretaps '' , detectors which could pick up conversations on a phone line . And over time , law enforcement agencies have come to rely on this capability to aid in criminal investigations . However , powerful new encryption technologies threaten this status quo , by making possible truly private communication . A small chip in each phone could soon make it literally impossible to overhear a conversation without physical microphones at either end . In order to preserve the ability of law enforcement agencies to tap phone conversations , the U.S. government announced on April 16 , 1993 that it had developed and begun manufacturing a special `` wiretap '' chip to be placed in future phones , instead of the total privacy chips which have been under private development . The same day , AT & T announced it would use these chips `` in all its secure telephone products '' . Each chip would be created under government supervision , when it would be given a fixed indentifier and encryption key . Periodically during each conversation , the chip would broadcast its identifier and other info in a special `` law enforcement block '' . Law enforcement officers with a court order could then obtain the key corresponding to the indentifier from special trust agencies , and could thereby listen in on any future or previously recorded conversations on that phone . To date , most concerns voiced about this plan have been about its security . The government wo n't disclose the encryption algorithm , and many suspect the government will not limit its access in the way it has claimed . The track record of previous governments does not inspire confidence on this point [ 1 ] . However , this paper will neglect these concerns , and ask instead whether this new wiretap chip is a cost-effective tool for police investigation . That is , which is a cheaper way for society to investigate crime : force phone communications to support wiretaps , or give police agencies more money to investigate crimes in other ways ? Or to put it another way , would police agencies be willing to pay for each wiretap , if they had to pay their share of the full social cost of forcing phones to support wiretaps ? To start to answer this question , we might compare the current benefits wiretaps provide to law enforcement agencies with projected costs of implementing the new wiretap chip plan . And since current benefits are easier to estimate , we begin there . WIRETAP BENEFITS 1990 is the latest year for which wiretap statistics are available [ 2 ] . In that year , 872 wiretap installations were requested , and no requests were denied . ( This figure does not include wiretaps obtained with the consent of a party to the conversation . ) 2057 arrests resulted from wiretaps started the same year , 1486 arrests came from wiretaps in previous years , and 55 % of arrests led to convictions . 76 % of the wiretaps were for phones ( vs pagers , email , etc . ) , 60 % were regarding drug offenses , and 40 % were requested by federal authorities . Each wiretap installation heard an average of 1487 calls , 22 % of them incriminating , among 131 people , and cost an average of $ 45,125 ( extrapolating from the 794 installations reporting costs ) , mostly for labor . Thus a total of about $ 40 Million was spent on wiretaps , to obtain about 4000 arrests , at $ 10,000 per arrest . Thus these arrests are at least four times more expensive than the $ 2500 per arrest figure one gets by dividing the $ 28 Billion spent by all police nationally by the total 11 Million non-traffic arrests [ 3 ] . Thus the $ 30 Million per year spent on phone taps is only one thousanth of the total police expenditures . And if we divide this by the 138 Million phone `` access '' lines in the country [ 3 ] , we get about 23 cents spent per year per phone line , or about two cents a month . In general , we deter a given class of criminals through a combination of a perceived probability of being caught and convicted , and some expected punishment level if convicted . So the social value of having wiretaps is no more than the amount that we would have to pay to get the same criminal deterrence through other means . If unable to wiretap a particular suspect 's phone , police might instead use hidden microphones , or investigate that suspect in other ways . Or police might focus on suspects more easily investigated without wiretaps . Or we might raise the fine or prison time for certain types of crime . If we generously assume that these substitutes for wiretaps would be on average twice as expensive as wiretaps , then the annual social benefit of phone wiretaps is about equal to the current spending level of two cents a month per phone line . WIRETAP COSTS Let us for the moment optimistically assume that the US government encryption scheme is as secure as whatever private enterprise would have offered instead , protecting our conversations from the spying ears of neighbors , corporations , and governments , both foreign and domestic . Even so , the need to support wiretaps would add many additional costs to build and maintain our communication system . Extra law enforcement blocks would be added to phone transmissions , increasing traffic by some unknown percentage . A special process must be used to add encryption keys to chips , while securely distributing these keys to special agencies , which must be funded and monitored . The chips themselves are designed by a military contractor , whose design is to remain secret , and are manufactured through a special process so that the chip becomes nearly impossible to take apart . ( Chips are now offered at the relatively high price of $ 30 a peice in lots of 10,000 [ 4 ] . ) Private encryption systems not supporting wiretaps would require none of these extra costs . Perhaps most important , government degree would at least partially replace private marketplace evolution of standards for how voice is to be represented , encrypted , and exchanged in our future phones . It is widely believed that governments are less efficient than private enterprise in procuring products and standards , though they may perhaps perform a useful brokering role when we choose between competing private standards . How much less efficient is a matter of debate , some say they pay twice as much , while others might say only 10 % more . Currently , a total of $ 96 Billion is spent as operating expenses of U.S. phone companies [ 3 ] , which comes out to about $ 60 per month per access line . If we compare this to the wiretap value of two cents per month , we see that if wiretaps raise average operating costs by even as much as one part in 3000 , then wiretaps are not cost effective ! And this does n't even include extra costs phone owners pay because their encryption chips are more expensive . Of course most phones would n't have encryption chips for a while , but the wiretap benefit per phone is still the same , so this argument still applies . CONCLUSION Given this dramatic difference between the total cost of running the phone system and the value of wiretaps , we can justify only the slightest modification of the phone system to accommodate wiretaps . When the only modification required was to allow investigators in to attach clips to phone wires , wiretap support may have been reasonable . But when we consider substantial modification , the burden of proof is clearly on those proposing such modification to show that the costs would really be less than the benefits . If consensus can not be obtain on this cost/benefit estimate , a compromise might be to tax phones which do not support wiretaps at a rate of say five cents per month , a tax payable to police agencies nationwide to compensate them for their loss of wiretap abilities .

All information or pointers are > appreciated . > Well , since my wife is ( in your gentle term ) a `` bastard '' , I can probably speak with a bit of authority on this . Any `` stigma '' associated with children conceived and/or born out of wedlock rests solely upon the parents -- they 've committed a sexual transgression for which they should repent . The child itself has no a priori limitations on him or her ; indeed , the concept of blaming the child for the parents ' sins is one most Mormons would find appalling ; note that LDS theology rejects original sin , as the term is usually defined , and the subsequent need for infant baptism ( cf . Moroni 8 in the Book of Mormon ) . Indeed , LDS doctrine goes one step further and in some cases holds parents responsible for their children 's sins if they have failed to bring them up properly ( cf . D & C 68:25-28 ; note that this passage applies it only to members of the LDS Church ) . Also note that there is no `` big genealogical book in Salt Lake City '' . The LDS Church has a massive storage facility in the nearby mountains containing ( on microfilm ) vital statistic records ( birth , christening , baptism , marriage , death ) gathered from all over the entire world . I may be misremembering , but I believe they have records for some 2 billion people in that vault . At the same time , the LDS Church is building up an on-line genealogical database . In neither case is there some kind of `` worthiness screening '' as to whether someone can be entered in . The only potential issue is that of establishing who the parents were , and that would apply only in the case of the database . ..bruce.. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Bruce F.

You should indeed be happy to know that you rekindled a huge discussion on distortions propagated by several of your contemporaries . If you feel that you can simply act as an Armenian governmental crony in this forum you will be sadly mistaken and duly embarrassed . This is not a lecture to another historical revisionist and a genocide apologist , but a fact . I will dissect article-by-article , paragraph-by-paragraph , line-by-line , lie-by-lie , revision-by-revision , written by those on this net , who plan to 'prove ' that the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds is nothing less than a classic un-redressed genocide .

Also , feel free to distribute all responses to your nearest ASALA/SDPA/ARF terrorists , the Armenian pseudo-scholars , or to those affiliated with the Armenian criminal organizations . x-Soviet Armenian government got away with the genocide of 2.5 million Turkish men , women and children and is enjoying the fruits of that genocide . You , and those like you , will not get away with the genocide 's cover-up . During the First World War and the ensuing years - 1914-1920 , the Armenians through a premeditated and systematic genocide , tried to complete its centuries-old policy of annihilation against the Turks and Kurds by savagely murdering 2.5 million Muslims and deporting the rest from their 1,000 year homeland . The attempt at genocide is justly regarded as the first instance of Genocide in the 20th Century acted upon an entire people .

Essentially what I am trying to decide is the best way to handle moving data from a port with automatic handshaking from or to a memory area that will be accessible by a main system processor when not in use by the smart data I/O . Which DMA or microcontroller chip would be best to use ? Fast , cheap , and easy to obtain would be nice , but I wo n't limit my choices to only those that fit those characteristics . Even an 8086/8088 ( under $ 5 ) would do what I want , but I am sure there is a better alternative -- like a microcontroller with onchip ( E ) EPROM .

It has been done , but the other companies do n't have the marketing budgets that MS do . 4DOS , for instance , is everything that COMMAND.COM should have been ( but never could be under MS ) . Those who use it usually find it more addictive than crack cocaine . But they have to rely on word of mouth for sales . It seems to have worked pretty good so far , but your corporate weenie manager type usually likes to see a big glossy ad in PC Magazine . That 's okay , marketing is n't a fundamental human right , but they 've got a product that's superior to the DOS command interpreter in every way . They have a lot more to be proud of than MS does . If MS really gave a damn , they could duplicate it , buy it outright ( they 've got the money ) , or even use the old ruse of sending engineers out to help them with compatability issues and absconding with the technology . DOS is a mediocre product at a cheap price backed up by top notch marketing and vendor agreements . The `` mediocre '' was excusable in the early days when it was someone else 's hack , but they 've had ten years to play with it . An interesting thought on that : Most MS products that I 'm aware of in the last few years allow you to access the names of the designers and programmers through easter egg screens , including Windows , or at least have the names buried in the files . Is there such a thing in DOS 5.0 and 6.0 , or are they too ashamed to have their names on it ? -- There 's at least one fool in every married couple .

Both families agree that He who wills and acts is always the one Hypostasis > of the Logos Incarnate . Marhaba Nabil , If we posit two minds in Christ , the mind of the logos and the mind of the human Jesus , then we must admit two wills . A mind is not a mind without a will . I know this has been dealt with in past Church prnouncements , but there is a philosophical problem here that should examined . T. V. Morris argued that the Incarnation can be seen like this : _____________ ( Mind of Logos ) ( _______ ) ( ( ) ) Here , the mind of Jesus is circumsribed by God the ( ( Human ) ) Son . God the Son has complete access to the human ( ( Mind ) ) mind but the human mind only has access to the mind ( ( ) ) of God the Son when the Son allows access . This ( ( _______ ) ) explains why Jesus said even he did not know the ( _____________ ) time of the kingdom . The human will acted in accordance with the divine will according to free human decision . But if the human will would have decided differently than what was intended the divine will would have interceded , but this was never the case . He employs some very interesting analogies to support the one person/two mind theory . The ideas of a completely healthy version of split personality from the field of psychology , and the intriguing ideas of being in a dream , seeing yourself acting , knowing that is you , but also being omniscient . The one hypostasis would be the unity of the two minds . Agreed . But I am still waiting for Morris and others to respond to the lingering problem of two minds making two persons . Christian analytic philosophers are breaking new ground in explicating the rationality of Theism and the Incarnation . ==================================== Ted Kalivoda ( tedr @ athena.cs.uga.edu ) University of Georgia , Athens Institute of Higher Ed . [ Note that `` person '' is being used in a more abstact sense here than the English . We connect person with personality and other things that are human attributes . I 'm not entirely sure whether I 'd want to apply personality to God , but if it is appropriate , then I think we 'd have to say that Christ had two personalities . -- clh ]

From : mls @ panix.com ( Michael Siemon ) Subject : commandments I ( the basics ) Organization : PANIX Public Access Unix , NYC Lines : 205 Why should anyone ( check : let 's restrict this to Christians , why do *we* ) want to find `` commandments '' in the books regarded as scripture ? What's going on ? I will pass on psychologizing answers ( whether dismissive or more open ) as not the kind of issue to deal with here -- the question is what is the *theological* point involved ? And it has been quoted `` at '' me often enough by those who do n't believe I take it seriously , that Jesus ( is said to have ) said , `` If you love me , you will obey my commands . '' [ John 14:15 ] I am , like any Christian , the slave of Christ , and it is my will that I should do as He wills me to do . I am ( also , or instead ) His younger brother , but still under His direction , though we both call God `` Abba . '' Christians , therefore , will try to find what it is that their Lord commands them , and discovering it will feel obligated to do it , or to confess their failure . Readers here may set aside the theologizing jargon ( such as `` slaves of Christ '' ) -- the point is that adherents of a religion *will* read the texts ( whether classified as `` inspired '' or not ) that are held up as models , in an effort to find application to their own situations . This practice ranges from `` devotional '' reading of sermons and the like to the exegesis of canon- ical scripture as `` the Word of God . '' And at the highest pitch , this leads to a question of whether we *can* find in inspired scripture something that can act as `` absolute '' guidance for our actions . The problem is in finding out just *what* it is our Lord commands . I am going to set aside for this essay one major direction in which Christians have looked for these commands , namely Christian tradition . That is not because *I* reject tradition , but because my primary audience in this essay is Protestants , who deny tradition a determinative value , in favor of the witness of Scripture . The question I want to deal with is , WHAT commandments can we find from our Lord in Scripture ? And that turns out to be a hard question . [ If any of my Protestant Inquisitors would *like* to turn the discussion to the authority of tradition , I can accomodate them : - ) , unlike *most* Protestants , Episcopalians admit claims from a ) Scripture b ) Reason and c ) Tradition on roughly equal standing . ] Earlier in John than my quote above , we read [ John 13:34 ] `` I give you a new commandment : love one another . '' This is the ONLY place in the NT where Christians are given an explicit commandment , with the context commenting on its imperative mode pronouncement by Jesus . At the same meal [ so we *readers* infer , since it is *not* in John , but in the Synoptics ] Jesus says , `` Take this [ bread ] ; this is my body . '' [ Mark 14:22 , cf . Matthew 26:26 , Luke 22:19 , 1 Corinthians 11:24 ] The mode is imperative ( Greek _labete_ ) , and hence this , too , is a `` commandment . '' In *both* cases we have to *infer* that the command is directed to a wider circle than the immediate collocation of disciples -- because we judge the evangelist 's point in mentioning it ( with the disciples by then mostly or entirely dead ) is that *we* are expected to follow this as a commandment from our Lord . In the case of communion , Paul 's mention ( at least ; this is probably true of the evangelists also ) implies an ongoing ritual liturgy in which these words operate to `` bind '' Christians to the original command to his disciples , as a continuing commandment to the Christian community . I am entirely comfortable with this inference , but I *must* point out that it is THERE , between us and the occasion on which Jesus spoke the command . I take it as a clear inference , at the very least the EVANGELIST 'S notion , that *all* Christians are called to love one another , in Jesus ' command directed at the disciples . But I have to call attention to the inference . The command CAN NOT apply to me without the generalization from the specific context of its statement to my own context as a `` disciple '' of Christ . All reading of scripture has to make such inferences , to get any sense out of the text whatsoever . This is a general problem in reading these texts -- we can not read them at all without our *own* understanding of our native languages in which we ( normally ) read the ( translated ) texts , and without *some* appreciation of the original context ( and at points , the original languages , when English misleads us . ) I am going to presume , in what follows , that we have the *general* problem of how to read scripture under control [ I do n't *really* think this is true , but it will suffice for my current purposes . ] I will address ONLY the issues that arise when we have already coped with the understanding of a 2000 year old text from another world than the one we live in . Questions at THAT level only introduce MORE reser- vations about the commandments issue than will be found stipulating that we can read the texts as the original audience might have done . Among the reasons we have for seeing John 's _agapate allelou_ as a *general* commandment ( not merely an instruction by Jesus to this disciples on that one occasion ) , and one linking it to the Synoptic `` Great Commandment '' is that we have criticism , from Jesus , about limiting our love to those whom we congenially associate with . In Matthew 5:43ff we read , `` You have learnt how it was said : 'You must love your neighbor ' and hate your enemy . But I say to you : love your enemies . '' In fact , the Leviticus context quoted does NOT say 'hate your enemy ' -- it is merely the common human presumption . ( And Leviticus is at pains to say that the `` love '' should extend to strangers amongst the people of Israel . ) Luke , in expanding on this same Q context , goes on to have Jesus say . `` Even sinners love those who love them . '' [ 6:27 ] All of this suggests [ quite strongly , I 'd say : - ) ] that *limiting* the scope of the `` new commandment '' is not quite what Jesus has in mind . In short , inference *leads me* to generalizing the actual text to a command that is `` in force '' on Christians , and with objects not limited to other Christians . Trickier than the _agapate allelou_ or Institution of communion , there is the case of the `` Great Commission '' where ( Matthew 10 , Mark 6 ) the Twelve are sent out to evangelize , `` Proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close at hand . '' The verb is imperative ( _ke : russete_ ) , but the context is rather specific to the Twelve , and there are further specifiers ( as in `` Do not turn your steps to pagan territory , and do not enter any Samaritan town '' -- the Lukan parallels are even more specific to Jesus ' final journey to Jerusalem ) which make it harder to see this generalizing to all Christians than the previous examples . That has n't prevented Christians from MAKING such an inference ; what I have to call attention to is that such inference is NOT justified in the text , nor ( unlike the first two cases I cite ) by the rhetoric of the evangelist urged on the reader . Still , Paul seems to have felt obliged to `` proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close at hand '' even ( contrary to Jesus ' instructions to the 12 : - ) ) to the gentiles , to the ends of the earth . So , Christians after him have also taken this as a `` commandment '' in the sense of John 14:15 . Do I `` accept '' this ? I don't know . It is surely rather speculative . But you see how the ripples of inference spread out from the text that is the pretext -- Christians ( may ) infer a general commandment , applicable to all , from what is presented in the gospels as a specific occasion . I do not ( necessarily ) object to this kind of generalization -- but I *insist* that people who make it *must* have an understanding that they are *reasoning* ( at some considerable length ) from what we actually *have* in scripture . There are *assumptions* involved in this reasoning , and *these* are *not* themselves scriptural ( though people will do their best to `` justify '' their assumptions by OTHER references to scripture -- which simply adds MORE inference into the mix ! ) Let 's move on to the `` Great Commandment '' -- that we should love God with our whole hearts and minds and souls . This is , perhaps , the Synoptic '' equivalent '' of John 's _agapate allelou_ . And yet , it is not PRESENTED as a commandment , in our texts . Rather , the context is controversy with the Pharisees . To cite Matthew [ 22:34ff ] '' But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees they got together and , to disconcert him , one of them put a question , '' Master , which is the greatest commandment of the Law ? '' It is by no means obvious here ( though I accept it as such ) that Jesus' answer is meant to be a commandment *to Christians* . He is answering a polemic from his enemies . [ Mark 's account , in 12:28-34 casts the answer in a far more positive light as ( so the `` scribe '' in this version says ) '' far more important than any holocaust ( I need to point out that this word originates in the context of animal sacrifice ; forget the Nazis for this ) or sacrifice . '' Luke is intermediate -- he has a lawyer posing the question '' to disconcert '' Jesus , and gets the Good Samarian parable for his pains [ Luke 10:25-37 ] . The contexts here are so confusingly various that one could be forgiven for drawing *no* inferences : - ) In *no* account is this said as if it were obviously to be taken as a commandment binding on Christians -- though I think it an entirely reasonable conclusion in each case that Jesus thinks it to be so . The point is that our mental gears HAVE to grind a cycle or so to get to any conclusion from all of this about what WE are commanded to do , by Jesus . And all of this is contingent on our understanding the point of Jesus ' use of the Torah in the ( all quite different ) gospel accounts , and the application of such a context to *us* . The different contexts among the Synoptics are curious . It should be noted that ONLY in Luke do we get the `` fixing '' of this command by the parable of the Good Samaritan . We may look for an analogous *intent* in Matthew , where 7:12 gives the `` Golden Rule '' as `` the meaning of the Law and the Prophets '' ( and where we may also hear an echo of Hillel saying the same , a generation before Jesus . ) If we make these associations ( which I think are entirely reasonable ) , we are -- again -- indulging in inference . The texts do not *explicitly* support us ; rather , we *read* the texts as having this kind of inter-relationship . Current literary theory calls this `` intertextuality . '' My discussion of why the _agapate allelou_ `` has '' to apply beyond the community of the disciples , and beyound the circle of Christian believers , applies again here , to buttress a conclusion that this *is* ( despite the presentation not saying so explicitly ) a `` commandment '' to Christians . Few Christians would disagree with my conclusions -- but I *must* point out that they *are* conclusions , they *depend* on rather elaborate chains of reasoning that are simply NOT present in the texts , themselves . The contextual problem keeps coming up , more and more severely as we look at those sayings of Jesus that are NOT so universally taken by Christians as commandments . And we get some really hard cases . Take divorce . Mark is pretty clear , `` The man who divorces his wife and marries another is guilty of adultery against her . '' [ 10:11 , cf . Luke 16:18 ] -- except that Matthew has an escape clause [ `` except in the case of fornication '' , 5:31 ] . This seems to be a rather clear `` commandment '' ( whether or not we take Matthew's reservation ) ; and some Christians , to this day , take it so . But some do n't , at least in practice . This is rather peculiar ; it is not as if Jesus were not explicit about this ( whereas He says nothing at all about some of the things people gnash their teeth over . ) How is it possible , if the commands of Christ are clear , that Matthew can so disagree with the other evangelists of the synoptic tradition ? I 'm going to continue this examination , into ever-murkier waters , but this is enough to start with . The theme is : `` finding commandments in scripture is an exercise in inference ; our inferences are informed by OUR assumptions , that is , our own cultural biases . '' I have , so far , identified a very few '' commandments '' that are generally accepted by all Christians -- and yet in these , already , some of the difficulties start to surface . It is these difficulties I want to discuss in my next essay on this topic . The divorce commandment already strikes at some of the difficulties : I see almost no evidence that the people who are so eager to find commandments to condemn *me* with , spend any time at all writing nasty screeds to soc.couples or misc.legal about the horrors or viciousness of divorce , or demanding that US law refuse to allow it , or refuse `` unrepentant divorcees '' places in their churches . [ That is not to say that divorce *doesn't* enter into consideration in general -- it is most definitely a matter of concern , in even the most `` liberal '' church circles . For example , a ( wildly ) liberal Episcopalian priest of my aqauintence , in a ( wildly ) liberal diocese , has recommended to a couple who approached him to marry them that they have a '' private '' secular ceremony before a judge , so that the `` public '' ceremony he celebrated need not go through an agonizing `` examination '' by officials who would just as soon NOT take on this role of interpreting the commands we are faced with as Christians . This , in a church that was effectively CREATED by a famous divorce ! ] -- Michael L.

Is it just to gain an effective increase in keyspace to defeat a potential keysearch ? ( If so , why use 80 bit keys ? ) Not knowing anything about the Skipjack algorithm , it's not really possible to guess whether this makes it harder or easier to guess S1 , S2 . Why are N1 , N2 , and N3 formed as they are ? It would be facinating to see the Skipjack algorithm , to look for ways of attacking it that require three ciphertext blocks formed in that odd way . Where do the 34-bit constant values that are concatenated with the serial number to form N1 , N2 , N3 come from ? Are they changed from chip to chip , or session to session ? ( Even if they 're published in the NY Times , if SkipJack is resistant to known-plaintext attacks , when using triple- encryption , then there 's no break in security . But why allow that kind of weird format ? If those three 34-bit values are truly-random bits , then maybe it 's used to ensure that a known-plaintext attack on SkipJack , if it exists , ca n't be easily used to derive S1 and S2 for a whole production run of these chips ... . ) Does Dorothy Denning read this group ? If not , is someone on the group forwarding questions like these to her , or Martin Hellman , or anyone else who 's seen more details about the chip ? -- John Kelsey

We discussed about error ( s ) in XV 2.21 which shows images only as 8bit , and my suggestion above works perfectly with it . So far I have seen a colormap editing window in XV -- that is , there must be a colormap anyway . The problems you present are exist anyway , and I did n't tried to solve them at all , because I would not make such problems to my programs in the first place . Gamma and color corrections are easily done to 24bit image as I presented . There 's no need make tricks from 8bit/quantized image back to 24 bit image . > > > How would you suggest doing colour editing on a 24 bit file ?

Ok , you 're writing about situation that user want edit images as 24bit and user want edit individual colors -- your questions , by the way , jumps off the discussion a bit . My solution does n't work , because there 's no colormap withing real 24bit image -- you see , user see 24bit image ; going back to 8bit is silly . About changing individual colors in 8bit/quantized/rasterized image : changing individual colors in colormap is useless in most cases if the image is quantized and rasterized -- small change may make serious errors to anywhere in the image . XV allows this feature , but I do n't recommend to use it with the mentioned type images . Moreover , XV is not a paint program ; you can only make those global changes . In full 24bit XV , changing individual colors sounds like paint program job . If person have 8bit screen , there 's need for tricks to get the original 24bit image modified . Because user do n't see full 24bit image , there 's need to make approximations and it is not possible to modify individual colors but individual pixels or pixel groups ( if image is rasterized ) . To select indiavidual color , there could be 7x7 cursor window which shows true color image in cursor window area -- selecting individual color is possible from that . Ok , I do n't have thought very much 24bit painting programs , never seen such in good view and are not planned to make such . Not to mention 24bit painting program in 8bit screen ... > Yes again . What *is* ( was ? ) wrong with xv ? It saved 8bit/quantized/rasterized images as 24bit jpegs ; jpeg is not designed for that . Also , human expect that 24bit will be saved as 24bit image ; say , person would like to crop part of the image and save it , then it is expected that the image still is the same . So , XV were designed without thinking about human interface and how human expect the program work -- design error . I have heard XV were designed first for 8bit images/files , but it were not good idea to take full 24bit images without making major change to the original design . So , even all screen images are 8bit , the processed images and saved images could have been 24bit very easily , instead of 8bit . Before anybody will make a note : yes , I may as well make a lift where 'up ' means that the lift goes down and 'down ' means that the lift goes up , and put a note on this design solution to the manuals -- however , even the manuals tells the correct situation , it does n't solve the problem . ( Americans : the lift is just an example : ) Well , my text may be a bit hard reading , hopefully you suggeeded to read it . Juhana Kouhia

Watch your terminology . `` Dealer invoice '' is *not* `` dealer cost '' . You 'll hear lots of ads screaming `` two dollars over dealer invoice ! ! ! '' Sounds like a real deal , huh ? No . You know what the `` dealer invoice '' ( also called factory invoice ) is ? It 's a piece of paper with numbers on it that the factory sends the dealer . What do the numbers signify ? Absolutely nothing . It 's a marketing gimmick that the salesman can wave in your face to impress you . Note that nowhere on the `` invoice '' does it claim to be the real price of the car , and most ads which mention dealer invoice will end with a very fast , low voice saying something like `` invoice may not reflect actual dealer cost '' . Actually , I *guarantee* it does not reflect actual dealer cost . Also , the reasonable profit for dealer is usually around three percent . Adjust according to the dealer cost of the car and any options that you want . Haggle like hell with the salesman over the cost of '' dealer prep '' and `` protection package '' ( i.e . a few squirts of paint and fabric protectant ) . While you 're at it , ask the salesman to toss in a thing or two that does n't cost him any cash . My wife and I got a joyride in a twin-turbo Mitsubishi 3000GT when we bought our Mitsubishi mini-van .

The answer ot this question is an unqualified yes . You can use any old vga/svga monitor with a centris . You do need an adaptor ( I use a Mac vga-q from james engineering ( 510 ) 525-7350 ) to run between the two machines . THe adaptor I have mentioned will convert a centris to a three row vga/svga 25 ( ? ) pin adaptor for your monitor . NOW , the special interest disclaimer . The above answer is correct for using a vga monitor at 600x400 resolution . IF your monitor will sync to 56Khz horizontal the above adaptor will allow you to choose 800x600 resolution ( I prefer this on my 1604s ) . THen You have the question of matching adaptors and sync rates . I would advocate calling James engineering because they seem to have a clue . As to the comment by the person who said do n't bother calling Apple because they will treat you like an idiot this is totally untrue . APPLE WILL TREAT YOU LIKE A F**KING ASSANINE IDIOT FOR EVEN CONSIDERING GOING THIRD PARTY AND IF YOU WANT THIS TREATMENT WANTS YOU TO PAY FOR THEIR THECH SUPPORT LINE ( the supposedly compitantly one ) AND THEN STILL HAS NO FU***** CLUE . personal experience . also the tech suppport for the vga monitor makers does n't see to extend to Macs ( Sony , Magnavox ) . In addition to this to find out the info you will have to call dealers unless you can find the sync rates elsewhere as ads like Hardware that fits ( * & ^ % & % ^ % $ $ ( & ** & ^ ( % & % ^ $ ! ) that rate monitor resolutions give the most favorable rating ( which usually means you can get this if you use a specialized application video card ) . ( i.e . `` well you can get a resolution 1168x832 on this $ 5 , 9 '' `` super smelly sock '' monitor that will let you display TWO FULL PAGES side by side . All you need is our reasonably priced `` oder eater '' video board for $ 27,000 and it will give you an ultra fast horizontal sync rate of SIX fast kilohertz and three Khz vertical . '' ) Note : with the sony 1604 at least on the centris 610 built in video board using an 832x624 adaptor , there is a boarder of an inch + to the sides of the image after adjusting the horizontal width as favorably as possible . Using a 800x600 adaptor this can be reduced to about half an inch . -A .

Including women and children , such persons discovered so far do not exceed one thousand five hundred in Erzincan and thirty thousand in Erzurum . All the fields in Erzincan and Erzurum are untilled , everything that the people had has been taken away from them , and we found them in a destitute situation .

Though there is a command in the law not to heed to one who prophecies falsely , it is still possible for the one who has prophecied falsely to prophecy truely again . Take , for example the story in Kings about the man of God from Judah who came to israel and prophecied against a king . The Lord had commanded him to not eat or drink till he returned home . Another prophet wanted this man of God to stay in his house , so he prophecied falsely that the Lord wanted the man of God to stay in his house . While they ate and drank in his house , the Lord gave the prophet who lied a word that the man of God would die from breaking the word of the Lord . It came to pass . Link Hudson .

From : jhpb @ sarto.budd-lake.nj.us ( Joseph H. Buehler ) Subject : Re : The doctrine of Original Sin Organization : none Lines : 42 Regarding the consequences of the original sin : Catholics believe that what Adam primarily lost by his sin , for himself and the human race , was sanctifying grace . This is basically a share in the Divine life . Take a rock and make it able to talk : what God does to a human being through sanctifying grace is similar . It makes such a one able to live on a plane that is above the powers of any possible creature . This is the `` everlasting life '' that the New Testament speaks of . What Christ did when he came was to restore this life of sanctifying grace to the human race . He instituted the Sacraments as the means by which this life is given to people , and its increase fostered . The absence of sanctifying grace at death means automatic exclusion from Heaven . The nature of Heaven is such that it 's impossible for a human being to have any part in it without the gift of sanctifying grace . To use my example , it would be like taking that rock and attempting to hold a conversation with it : rocks can not talk . Neither can human beings live in Heaven without sanctifying grace . This all obviously applies equally well to infants or adults , since both have souls . Infants must be baptized , therefore , or they can not enter into Heaven . They too need this form of life in them , or they can not enter into Heaven . Turning it around , infant baptism is good supporting evidence for the Catholic belief in sanctifying grace . Unless Baptism causes some change in an infant 's soul , there is no particular reason to insist on the practice . Yet infant Baptism was probably practiced by the Apostles themselves , and was *certainly* part of the Church shortly thereafter . There is evidence for infant Baptism in the New Testament itself : 1 Cor 1:16 , Acts 16:15 , 16:33 , 18:8 , also Acts 11:14 . It is known for sure that at least one disciple of the Apostle John was baptized as an infant : St. Polycarp ( because of a remark he makes in the acts of his martyrdom ) . St. Justin Martyr mentions men and women baptized as infants . There is direct evidence in St. Irenaeus 's `` Against Heresies '' , and in Tertullian 's `` On Baptism '' . All these so far mentioned are in the first 170 years after our Lord 's death . After that , there starts to be tons of evidence for the practice .

To just about everyone . I keep hearing this , but every assertion of this form has come from government sources except two . As far as I am concerned , I am not ready to stipulate that Koresh EVER promised to come out except for his first promise and his last promise . The first promise was conditional on his audio tape being given NATIONAL exposure . Well , it never was -- it was broadcast locally , in a chopped-up fashion , and that 's all . And even then , they cleverly cut it off when it got to the part where he demanded `` national exposure , '' but not so cleverly that we did n't hear it . The last promise was conditional on the finishing of his manuscript . We 'll never know if he would have kept that one . > The FBI etc . ca n't wait forever for Koresh to come out .

Not always true . In fact , in the case of Doug Gilmour , he actually praises them . Europeans that do those things are scum in Cherry 's opinion . Canadian kids that do them are `` tough , just like a real Canadian '' . Ulf Samuelsson cheap shots Mark Messier 's ribs and Don wants Ulf 's head .

In this post on depression , I 'm laying it all out . I 'll continue to post here because I think that I have some knowledge that could be useful . Once you have read this post , you should know where I 'm coming from when I post again in the future .

If anyone > can suggest a Philly area nutritionist , or else some literature to read , > I 'd appreciate it . Lida , I can emphasize with your situation . Both my wife and I suffered from bouts of depression . Her 's was brought on by breast cancer and mine was a rebound stress reaction to her modified radical mastectomy and chemotherapy . Lida , I used my knowledge of nutrition to get her through her six months of chemotherapy ( with the approval of her oncologist ) . When severe depression set in a few months after the chemo stopped , I tried to use supplements to bring her out of it . I had `` cured '' her PMS using supplements and I really thought that I knew enough about the role of diet in depression to take care of her depression as well . It did n't work and she was put on Prozac by her oncologist . Two Winters ago ( three years after by wife 's breast cancer ) I got hit with severe depression ( pretty typical and one reason why many marriages break up after breast cancer or another stressor ) . I tried to take care of it for several months with supplementation . Did n't work . My internist ended up putting me on Prozac . I was going to give you a list of several studies that have been done using B6 , niacin , folate and B12 to `` cure '' depression . I 'm not going to do that because all you would be doing is flying blind like I was . Lida , I do believe that depression can have a dietary component . But the problem is that you need to know exactly what the problem is and then use an approach which will `` fix '' the problem . For chemotherapy , I knew exactly what drugs were going to be used and exactly what nutrients would be affected . Same thing for PMS . I was flying blind for both of these stressors but the literature that I used to devise a treatment program was pretty good . Depression is just too complicated . What you really need is a nutritional scan . This is not a diet analysis but an analysis of your bodies nutrient reserves . For every vitamin and mineral ( except vitamin C ) , you have a reserve . The RDA is not designed to give you enough of any nutrient to keep these reserves full , it is only designed to keep them from being emptied which would cause clinical pathology . Stress will increase your need for many vitamins and minerals . This is when your reserves become very important . Lida , without your permission , I 'm going to use your post as a conduit to try to explain to the readers in this group and Sci . Med . where I 'm coming from . I have taught a course on human nutrition in one of the Osteopathic Medical schools for ten years now . I 've written my own textbook because none was available . What I teach is not a rehash of biochemistry . I preach nutrient reserves ( yes my lectures in this course are referred to by my students as sermons ) . Here is what I cover : Indroduction and Carbohydrates Lipids Proteins I Proteins II Energy Balance Evaluation of Nutritional Status I , A Clinical Perspective Evaluation of Nutritional Status II , Evaluation of Nutritional A Biochemical Perspective Status III , Homework Assignment Using the Nutritionist IV Diet and Fitness Analysis Software program Weight Control Food Fads and Facts Age-Related Change in Nutrient Requirements Food Additives , Contaminants and Cancer Drug-Nutrient Interactions Mineral and Water Balance Sodium , Potassium and Chloride Calcium , Magnesium and Phosphorus Iron Zinc and Copper Iodine and Fluoride Other Trace Minerals Vitamin A Vitamin E Vitamins D and K Vitamin C Thiamin and Niacin Riboflavin and Pyridoxine Pantothenic and Folic acids Biotin and B12 Other Nutrient Factors Enteral Nutrition Parenteral Nutrition Every three years I spend my entire Summer reviewing the Medical literature to find material that I can use in my nutrition textbook . I last did this in the Summer of 1991 . I read everything that I can find and then sit down and rewrite my lecture handouts which are bound in three separate books that have 217 , 237 and 122 pages . Opposite each page of written text ( which I write myself ) I 've pulled figures , tables and graphs from various copyrighted sources . Since this material is only being used for educational purposes , I can get around the copyright laws ( so far ) . I can not send this material out to newsgroup readers ( as I 've been asked to do ) . I am now in the process of trying to get a grant to setup a nutrition assessment lab . This is the last peice of the nutrition puzzle that I need to make my education program complete . This lab will let me measure the nutrient reserve for almost all the vitamins and minerals that are known to be required in humans . The Mayo clinic already uses a similiar lab to design supplement programs for their cancer patients . Cancer Treatment Centers of America , which is a private for-profit organization with hospitals in Illinois and Oklahoma ( Tulsa ) also operates a nutritional assessment clinical lab . I also believe that the Pritikin Clinic in California has a similiar lab setup . For physicians reading this post , I would suggest that you get the new Clinical Nutrition Textbook that has just been published ( Feb ) by Mosby . I have been using Alpers Manual of Nutritional Therapeutics ( a Little Brown series book ) as a supplemental text for my course but Alpers is geared more to residency training . Two M.D 's have written this new Clinical Nutrition textbook and it is geared more towards medical student education and it does a good job of covering the lab tests that can be run to assess a patient 's nutritional status . Let me quote a few sentences from the Preface of this new text : '' So-called nutrition specialists were in reality gastroenterologists , hematologists , or pediatricians who just happened to profess some knowledge of nutrition as it related to their field of practice . '' `` Unfortunately , about two thirds of the medical schools in the United States require no formal instruction in nutrition . '' `` But times and medical practice have changed . More than half of the leading causes of death in this country are nutrition related . '' `` ... this monograph should accomplish the following two objectives : ( 1 ) it should complement your medical training by emphasizing the relevance of nutrition to your medical practice ; and ( 2 ) it should heighten your awareness of nutrition as a medical speciality that is vitally important for both disease prevention and the treatment of diseases of essentially every organ system . '' Roland L. Weinsier , MD , DrPH Lida , my advise to you is that you tell your family members to try to find a physician who has an understanding of the role that vitamins and minerals ( yes even magnesium may play a role in depression ) play in depression and who could get a nutritional profile run . Menopause is often a time when women suffer depression . There are a lot of hormonal changes that are occuring but they are not the same ones that occur during PMS . A nutritionist may also be able to help . Not too long ago a poster mentioned that his nutritionist had diagnosed a selenium deficiency based on a red cell glutathionine peroxidase test ( the specific test for the selenium reserve ) . Most clinical labs will not run this test and I advised him to try to make sure that the lab that did the test was certified . There are also a lot of hair and nail analysis labs setup to do trace mineral analysis but these labs are not regulated . Checks of these labs using certified standards , and also those doing water lead analysis , showed some pretty shoddy testing was going on . If you or anyone else finds someone who will run these speciality nutrition tests , make sure that they are using a lab that has been certified under CLIA ( the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act ) . A diet analysis may be helpful since many nutrient reserves have been shown to correlate fairly well with the dietary intake as monitored by food logging and software analysis ( Nutritionist IV and other software programs ) . But there are still about half of the nutrients required by humans that do not show a very good correlation between apparent dietary intake and reserve status . Until we have more nutritional assessment clinical labs in operation in the U.S. and physicians who have been trained how to use the nutritional profile that these labs provide to devise a treatment approach that uses diet changes and supplementation , anti-depressants will probably continue to be the best approach to depression .

However , assuming your implication to be more-or-less correct , your final result is still invalid . If 50 % of *all* males have had more than 7.3 partners , and you deduct the assumed 1 % of homosexual males , what remains is not 49.5 % , but still *50 % * of all *heterosexual* males .

The University has neither control over nor responsibility for the opinions of users . Organization : Nyx , Public Access Unix at U. of Denver Math/CS dept . Distribution : usa Lines : 124 The following article by columnist Mike Royko is his humorous commentary on some of the public 's perception of doctors and their salaries . I hope some of you will find it as amusing as I did . ____________________________________________________________________________ [ Reprinted w/o permission ] '' There 's no cure for stupidity of poll on doctors ' salaries '' By Mike Royko Tribune Media Services On a stupidity scale , a recent poll about doctors ' earnings is right up there . It almost scored a perfect brain-dead 10 . It was commissioned by some whiny consumers group called Families USA . The poll tells us that the majority of Americans believe that doctors make too much money . The pollsters also asked what a fair income would be for physicians . Those polled said , oh , about $ 80,000 a year would be OK. How generous . How sporting . How stupid . Why is this poll stupid ? Because it is based on resentment and envy , two emotions that ran hot during the political campaign and are still simmering . You could conduct the same kind of poll about any group that earns $ 100,000-plus and get the same results . Since the majority of Americans do n't make those bucks , they assume that those who do are stealing it from them . Maybe the Berlin Wall came down , but do n't kid yourself . Karl Marx lives . It 's also stupid because it did n't ask key questions , such as : Do you know how much education and training it takes to become a physician ? If those polled said no , they did n't know , then they should have been disqualified . If they gave the wrong answers , they should have been dropped . What good are their views on how much a doctor should earn if they do n't know what it takes to become a doctor ? Or maybe a question should have been phrased this way : `` How much should a person earn if he or she must ( a ) get excellent grades and a fine educational foundation in high school in order to ( b ) be accepted by a good college and spend four years taking courses heavy in math , physics , chemistry , and other lab work and maintain a 3.5 average or better , and ( c ) spend four more years of grinding study in medical school , with the third and fourth years in clinical training , working 80 to 100 hours a week , and ( d ) spend another year as a low-pay , hard-work intern , and ( e ) put in another three to 10 years of post-graduate training , depending on your specialty and ( f ) maybe wind up $ 100,000 in debt after medical school and ( g ) then work an average of 60 hours a week , with many family doctors putting in 70 hours or more until they retire or fall over ? '' As you have probably guessed by now , I have considerably more respect for doctors than does the law firm of Clinton and Clinton , and all the lawyers and insurance executives they have called together to remake America 's health care . Based on what doctors contribute to society , they are far more useful than the power-happy , ego-tripping , program-spewing , social tinkerers who will probably give us a medical plan that is to health what Clinton 's first budget is to frugality . But propaganda works . And , as the stupid poll indicates , many Americans wrongly believe that profiteering doctors are the major cause of high medical costs . Of course doctors are well-compensated . They should be . Americans now live longer than ever . But who is responsible for our longevity -- lawyers , Congress , or the guy flipping burgers in a McDonald 's ? And the doctors prolong our lives despite our having become a nation of self-indulgent , lard-butted , TV-gaping couch cabbages . Ah , that is not something you heard President Clinton or Super Spouse talk about during the campaign or since . But instead of trying to turn the medical profession into a villain , they might have been more honest if they had said : `` Let us talk about medical care and one of the biggest problems we have . That problem is you , my fellow American . Yes , you , eating too much and eating the wrong foods ; many of you guzzling too much hooch ; still puffing away at $ 2.50 a pack ; getting your daily exercise by lumbering from the fridge to the microwave to the couch ; doing dope and bringing crack babies into the world ; filling the big city emergency rooms with gunshot victims ; engaging in unsafe sex and catching a deadly disease while blaming the world for not finding an instant cure . `` You and your habits , not the doctors , are the single biggest health problem in this country . If anything , it is amazing that the docs keep you alive as long as they do . `` In fact , I do n't understand how they can stand looking at your blubbery bods all day . `` So as your president , I call upon you to stop whining and start living cleanly . Now I must go get myself a triple cheesy- greasy with double fries . Do as I say , not as I do . '' But for those who truly believe that doctors are overpaid , there is another solution : Do n't use them . That 's right . You do n't feel well ? Then try one of those spine poppers , needle twirlers , or have Rev . Bubba lay his hands upon your head and declare you fit . Or there is the do-it-yourself approach . You have chest pains ? Then sit in front of a mirror , make a slit here , a slit there , and pop in a couple of valves . You 're going to have a kid ? Why throw your money at that overpaid sawbones so he can buy a better car and a bigger house than you will ever have ( while paying more in taxes and malpractice insurance than you will ever earn ) ? Just have the kid the old-fashioned way . Squat and do it . And if it survives , you can go to the library and find a book on how to give it its shots . By the way , has anyone ever done a poll on how much pollsters should earn ?

The following program is a very quick hack I created a few months ago to determine whether a Sun Sparcstation IPC could perform real-time , full-duplex encrypted audio with resulting data rates sustainable by today 's modems . This test program reads linearly-encoded audio from the audio device , compresses it with GSM 06.10 ( compresses frames of 160 13-bit samples recorded at 8kHz into 260 bits resulting in a 50 Hz frame rate ) , encrypts it with DES , then reverses the process and sends the reconstructed audio back to the audio device . The compressed , encrypted audio stream is 13 kbits/s ( ! ) . My Sparcstation IPC ( not exactly a very fast machine these days , certainly slower than an ELC ) would just barely sustain this activity ( audio underruns would occcur but the speech was very intelligible ) . I ran it as a real-time process to get the best results . Remember , though , that this program is a quick hack and the performance can certainly be improved . The audio compression routines can be ftp 'd from tub.cs.tu-berlin.de , I believe ( look for gsm or toast ) . I used Eric Young 's DES implementation but I no longer know where I got it from .

This is not a good idea.. I upgraded my motherboard last fall . I would have been quite pissed at any software that would have forced me to reinstall simply because I changed motherboards .

Some of the cars I have had ( all standard transmissions 4 or 5 speeds ) recommend changing the transmission fluid at 30,000 miles under normal driving conditions .

Pass a law stating that if , within a year of performaing a wiretap on someone , a police agency hasn't managed to convict the suspect of the crime the warrant/wiretap was for , then that agency owes the suspect $ 1 million to repay him/her for lost privacy . Of course , there are *still* problems with the technical aspects of Clipper , and with the one-size-fits-all mentality that would be behind an attempt to enforce it as a standard . But this would be a way for those in favor of allowing continued wiretaps to assure us that it will only be used in cases where the crime is important and the police are all but certain that there really will be a conviction ... . -- John KJ elsey

From : joel @ cray.com ( Joel Broude ) Subject : Mevicore vs. Lopid vs. ? Nntp-Posting-Host : equalizer Organization : Cray Research Superservers Inc. , San Diego CA , USA Lines : 26 I used to be on lopid . It did a good job of reducing cholesterol ( 295 down to around 214 ) , as well as LDL and triglycerides . Then , I got pneumonia , and for some reason , the Lopid stopped working very well ; cholesterol and triglycerides soared . The levels might have stabilized over time , but a new doctor had me quit , wait a month , then switch to Mevicore . On Mevicore , my total cholesterol was down to 207 , LDL was 108 , and HDL was 35 ; but the trig 's were still very high , around 318 , and my liver tests came back slightly abnormal , SGOT = 83 ( N = 1-35 ) , GGTP ( ? hard to read copy ) = 42 ( N = 0 - 35 ) . He said the liver numbers were not offbase enough to cause him concern , and the triglycerides are not as important as the cholesterol figures . He had me stop the Mevicore to allow the liver to heal ( `` Just to be extra cautious , though I 'm sure it 's not a problem . `` ) , and wants me to go back on it after that . I suggested maybe Lopid might be the better choice , and he said that he would n't object if that 's what I want to do . But Lopid has one particular side effect I 'm not fond of . Should the above liver and trig figures be feared ? What happens to folks with high trig levels ? Is my liver in danger with the above results ? Would I be better off on Lopid , despite its inconvenient side effect , or , perhaps , some other drug ? ( Niacin affected my liver , too ) .

I do n't think we should draw borders around newsgroups , christians are free to read and post entries on the atheist newsgroups , and muslims are free to so so in other groups as well . It 's up to each individual to define their time schedule concerning postings . The problems we all have noticed on various newsgroups is the evangelistical method of telling that ' I am right , and you are wrong ' . This is true of both theists and atheists .

Paul- You did a wonderful job of not doing anything humany possible to offend us Catholics ; hopefully I can be just as careful in my wording as you were . I also do n't want to extend this topic into an entire major issue of debate ( anymore than it already is ) , but just a note or two : 1 . Please do n't talk about Jesus ' `` parents '' -- the doctrinal positions of the church an unequivocally different regarding Mary and Joseph . I ( personally ) have never heard of anything being attributed to St. Joseph other than his sainthood ; that is , no reference *ever* to him being sinless , assumed into heaven , immaculately conceived , etc. -- all these ideas apply only to Mary . 2 . I would agree there is very little scriptural evidence for our doctrines about Mary . Needless to say , that presents a significant problem to those who accept the bible as the only source of doctrine . If , however , one turns to the sacred traditions of the undivided Christian Church , there is no problem finding plently of evidence that it was basically a unanimous belief among the apostles and all the early generation that Mary was assumed into heaven , body and soul , etc . etc . It was n't until the reformation that these doctrines were called into question . As far as I am concerned ( again , my personaly feelings ) if it 's a choice between the apostles or Luther , I 'll choose the apostles every time , whether or not it is recorded within the writings that the traditions of men have determined to be `` the bible '' . Like a said , just a couple of notes . As is often said , I believe that we must agree to ( politely ) disagree . May God 's peace and blessings be with you always in your search to discover His absolute truth . - Mike Walker mdw33310 @ uxa.cso.uiuc.edu ( Univ . of Illinois )

He also plugs a unique appliance called the `` Colema Board '' , which facilitates the self-administration of colonics . It sells for over $ 100 from a California-based company . He also plugs Vitra-Tox products as his chemical agents of choice : these include volcanic ash , supposedly for its electrical charge , and psyllium powder , for its bulkiness .

They are Pomaks and Gypsies . Oboy , this is exciting . First you discuss your non-existent literature tastes , then your fantasies , and now your choices of historical revisionism . Are you related to 'Arromdians ' of the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle ? The Agreement on the Exchange of Minorities uses the term 'Turks , ' which demonstrates what is actually meant by the previous reference to 'Muslims . ' The fact that the Greek governments also mention the existence of a few thousand non-Turkish Muslims does not change the essential reality that there lives in Western Thrace a much bigger Turkish minority . The 'Pomaks ' are also a Muslim people , whom all the three nations ( Bulgarians , Turks , and Greeks ) consider as part of themselves . Do you know how the Muslim Turkish minority was organized according to the agreements ? It also proves that the Turkish people are trapped in Greece and the Greek people are free to settle anywhere in the world . The Greek authorities deny even the existence of a Turkish minority . They pursue the same denial in connection with the Macedonians of Greece . Talk about oppression . In addition , in 1980 the 'democratic ' Greek Parliament passed Law No . 1091 , virtually taking over the administration of the vakiflar and other charitable trusts . They have ceased to be self-supporting religious and cultural entities . Talk about fascism . The Greek governments are attempting to appoint the muftus , irrespective of the will of the Turkish minority , as state official . Although the Orthodox Church has full authority in similar matters in Greece , the Muslim Turkish minority will have no say in electing its religious leaders . Talk about democracy . The government of Greece has recently destroyed an Islamic convention in Komotini . Such destruction , which reflects an attitude against the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage , is a violation of the Lausanne Convention as well as the 'so-called ' Greek Constitution , which is supposed to guarantee the protection of historical monuments . The government of Greece , on the other hand , is building new churches in remote villages as a complementary step toward Hellenizing the region . The longstanding use of the adjective 'Turkish ' in titles and on signboards is prohibited . The Greek courts have ordered the closure of the Turkish Teachers ' Association , the Komotini Turkish Youth Association and the Ksanti Turkish Association on grounds that there are no Turks in Western Thrace . Such community associations had been active until 1984 . But they were first told to remove the word 'Turkish ' on their buildings and on their official papers and then eventually close down . This is also the final verdict ( November 4 , 1987 ) of the Greek High Court . Helsinki Watch , a well-known Human Rights group , had been investigating the plight of the Turkish Minority in Greece . In August 1990 , their findings were published in a report titled 'Destroying Ethnic Identity : Turks of Greece . ' The report confirmed gross violations of the Human Rights of the Turkish minority by the Greek authorities . It says for instance , the Greek government recently destroyed an Islamic convent in Komotini . Such destruction , which reflects an attitude against the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage , is a violation of the Lausanne Convention . |1| HELSINKI WATCH : `` PROBLEMS OF TURKS IN WESTERN THRACE CONTINUE '' Ankara ( A.A ) In a 15-page report of the `` Helsinki Watch '' it is stated that the Turkish minority in Western Thrace is still faced with problems and stipulated that the discriminatory policy being implemented by the Greek Government be brought to an end . The report on Western Thrace emphasized that the Greek government should grant social and political rights to all the members of minorities that are equal to those enjoyed by Greek citizens and in addition they must recognize the existence of the `` Turkish Minority '' in Western Thrace and grant them the right to identify themselves as 'Turks ' . NEWSPOT , May 1992 |2| GREECE ISOLATES WEST THRACE TURKS The Xanthi independent MP Ahmet Faikoglu said that the Greek state is trying to cut all contacts and relations of the Turkish minority with Turkey . Pointing out that while the Greek minority living in Istanbul is called `` Greek '' by ethnic definition , only the religion of the minority in Western Thrace is considered . In an interview with the Greek newspaper `` Ethnos '' he said : `` I am a Greek citizen of Turkish origin . The individuals of the minority living in Western Trace are also Turkish . '' Emphasizing the education problem for the Turkish minority in Western Thrace Faikoglu said that according to an agreement signed in 1951 Greece must distribute textbooks printed in Turkey in Turkish minority schools in Western Thrace . Recalling his activities and those of Komotini independent MP Dr. SadIk Ahmet to defend the rights of the Turkish minority , Faikoglu said . `` In fact we helped Greece . Because we prevented Greece , the cradle of democracy , from losing face before European countries by forcing the Greek government to recognize our legal rights . '' On Turco-Greek relations , he pointed out that both countries are predestined to live in peace for geographical and historical reasons and said that Turkey and Greece must resist the foreign powers who are trying to create a rift between them by cooperating , adding that in Turkey he observed that there was will to improve relations with Greece . NEWSPOT , January 1993 |3| MACEDONIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS TO FACE TRIAL IN GREECE . Two ethnic Macedonian human rights activists will face trial in Athens for alleged crimes against the Greek state , according to a Court Summons ( No . 5445 ) obtained by MILS . Hristos Sideropoulos and Tashko Bulev ( or Anastasios Bulis ) have been charged under Greek criminal law for making comments in an Athenian magazine . Sideropoulos and Bulev gave an interview to the Greek weekly magazine `` ENA '' on March 11 , 1992 , and said that they as Macedonians were denied basic human rights in Greece and would field an ethnic Macedonian candidate for the up-coming Greek general election . Bulev said in the interview : `` I am not Greek , I am Macedonian . '' Sideropoulos said in the article that `` Greece should recognise Macedonia . The allegations regarding territorial aspirations against Greece are tales ... We are in a panic to secure the border , at a time when the borders and barriers within the EEC are falling . '' The main charge against the two , according to the court summons , was that `` they have spread ... intentionally false information which might create unrest and fear among the citizens , and might affect the public security or harm the international interests of the country ( Greece ) . '' The Greek state does not recognise the existence of a Macedonian ethnicity . There are believed to be between 350,000 to 1,000,000 ethnic Macedonians living within Greece , largely concentrated in the north . It is a crime against the Greek state if anyone declares themselves Macedonian . In 1913 Greece , Serbia-Yugoslavia and Bulgaria partioned Macedonia into three pieces . In 1919 Albania took 50 Macedonian villages . The part under Serbo-Yugoslav occupation broke away in 1991 as the independent Republic of Macedonia . There are 1.5 million Macedonians in the Republic ; 500,000 in Bulgaria ; 150,000 in Albania ; and 300,000 in Serbia proper . Sideropoulos has been a long time campaigner for Macedonian human rights in Greece , and lost his job as a forestry worker a few years ago . He was even exiled to an obscure Greek island in the mediteranean . Only pressure from Amnesty International forced the Greek government to allow him to return to his home town of Florina ( Lerin ) in Northern Greece ( Aegean Macedonia ) , where the majority of ethnic Macedonians live . Balkan watchers see the Sideropoulos affair as a show trial in which Greece is desperate to clamp down on internal dissent , especially when it comes to the issue of recognition for its northern neighbour , the Republic of Macedonia . Last year the State Department of the United States condemned Greece for its bad treatment of ethnic Macedonians and Turks ( who largely live in Western Thrace ) . But it remains to be seen if the US government will do anything until the Presidential elections are over . ================================================================ M. I. L.

To repent means to turn around . We , as a nation , have behaved incredibly arrogantly toward God condoning , encouraging , and even forcing folks to participate in activity directly opposed to the written Word of God . We have arrogantly set our nation far above the God who created it and allowed us the luxury of living in this land . We have set a bad example for other nations . We 've slaughtered unborn children by the millions . We have stricken the name of God from the classroom . We 've cheated God out of the honor due Him at every turn , and we owe God an apology every bit as public as our sins have been . When Jesus said `` Judge not that ye be not judged '' , he was not addressing those like John the Baptist who had repented and were calling others to repent . He was addressing those who remained in sin while heaping down condemnation on others for their sins . His message to us all was to remove the log from our own eye before removing the speck from our brother 's . But He also said to rebuke and to reprove . Do n't forget that this is a command too . Our problem today is that we tend to judge and condemn as though we were rebuking and we tend to neglect bringing folks back to the Lord with the excuse that we do n't want to judge anyone . In truth , what we need to do is to judge less and call others to repent more and to be able to distinguish between the two in our own motives . Call sin what it is and do so openly . Let it 's charge fall correctly where it should . But instead of running someone into hell over it , pull them out of their hellward path and onto the heavenward path . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - '' I deplore the horrible crime of child murder ...

Typical ( in the old 2x-oversampling units ) was a thirteen-tap FIR , implemented as a dedicated hardware addition circuit . At this kind of speed ( slow , by digital standards ) such an adder is much less expensive than analog components of comparable precision . I gleaned this information from a hardware manual for an old CD player design ; where one would find similar info for a particular CD ( the digital filter IS an interesting component , from my point of view ) , I have no idea . The digital filter is a kind of interpolation scheme ( read a book on numerical analysis , to see just how BROAD the term 'interpolation ' is ... ) , John Whitmore

Why have > you omitted that level from your model ? Yes , and the individual is not omitted ; I just did n't fully articulate the principles of Fractal Federalism . All government powers derive from the People ; each level can receive a new power from the level below through the amendment process , where a true consensus ( say a 3/4 majority ) writes that power into the Constitution of the level above ( in the case of the lowest level , an amendement is passed by a 3/4 majority vote ; in the case of higher levels , it must be passed by 3/4 of the legislatures . We can of course haggle about the specifics of `` true consensus '' when we hold our Constitutional Convention : - ) . Once a power has been granted , it may be exercised by the legislature . Powers not in the original Constitutions must percolate upward , starting from the individual . The ratification process for the original Constitutions should involve consensus and not simply a plurality or majority . Granting a `` right '' in a constitution is of course the same as empowering the government at that level to restrict the activities of the governments at the lower levels , so it operates in the same way as the amendment process ( again , that crazy resemblance to the supposed-but-not-actual U.S. government structure ) . This government structure is a very frustrating one for those people ( read- '' liberals '' ) who would like to have concentrated power to use the government to force people to do `` good '' ( a difficult-to-define word , and one that it is difficult to reach a consensus on ) . It is also a frustrating structure for those who want to use the government to dictate personal behavior ( read- '' big-government conservatives '' ) . I personally would rather see those types of people frustrated than the incredible erosion of liberty ( both civil and economic ) that is going on now . This is IMHO a `` good '' government stucture for those who see the role of government as the protection of individual liberties , while still recognizing that individuals need to have some influence in the type of community that they live in . > > 2 ) A free market works on government , not just economics . Succesful > > ideas propogate , unsuccessful ideas die . > What is your definition of a `` successful '' idea or a `` successful '' > government ? One which maintains peace , liberty , and the opportunity for happiness for its people , while working within the realities of human nature . You do bring up the point ( intentional or not ) that a `` lasting '' idea is by no means necessarily a `` successful '' idea . I believe that Fractal Federalism would at least bring many ideas to light , and The People would have the opportunity to democratically choose between `` good '' ideas and `` bad '' ideas . If the Docialists , er , I mean Democrats are right and government activism fosters a prosperous People , they will have a plethora of local opportunities to check their thesis . If Libertopia is possible , it will arise . If a balanced Conservative Republic is democratically received as the best level of government activity , it will become clear to The People that it is best . > > As far as `` set the moral tone '' is concerned , if a community does not > > collectively want to put up with prostitution going on in front of > > their kids , why should they have to ?

Right , and people would not rescind any freedoms ( read- `` empower the government '' ) except through the amendment process . That is how the Federal Government is supposed to work now , but the Supreme Soviet , er , I mean the Supreme Court put a stop to that `` republican government '' nonsense . In my hypothetical government , if there were a constitutional provision empowering the government to regulate churches the government ( whatever level we are talking about ) could indeed ban churches . The constitutional provision would be invalid if a higher level had a constitutional provision protecting free exercise of religion . The uppermost Constitution is still the Supreme Law of the Land . > ( I find it interesting that you applaud the idea of free-market > competition among various ideas , and yet support the right of he > majority in a community to suppress ideas which they do n't like . ) It is a matter of individuals being able to control their own associations and environment , not a matter of suppression of ideas . One dilemma of the human condition is that individuals need liberty , and they also need to have some control over their environment . In my '' Fractal Federalism '' government , certain `` rights '' are protected by the constitutions . Other `` rights '' are protected simply because the government has not been empowered to infringe upon them . When a consensus is reached that the government should have a certain power , then freedom is infringed upon . This can not be avoided -- murder statutes infringe upon freedom , but I think that the consensus of the American people is that murder statutes are a good idea . I am sure that many parents believe that they have a `` right '' to control the environment that their children live in . People feel that they have a `` right '' to sleep peacefully at night ; thus , there are noise ordinances . There are zoning laws that keep businesses from overrunning residential neighborhoods . I do not view these as bad things ( certainly some individual instances are bad , but the concept is not necessarily bad ) , I view them as the people in a community having some control over the type of community that they live in . I see the alternative as near anarchy . Like I said in another post , if you can come up with a scenario where an individual can do something truly autonomously -- with absolutely zero effect on anyone else -- then no individual or government has the right to restrict that activity . There are simply not very many behaviors that fit into the category of the truly autonomous , so the whole thing becomes an issue of one individual or group having power over another individual or group . I think that the `` Fractal Federalism '' approach is a sound , if not ideal , approach to limiting this restrictive power . The libertarian scenario degenerates to `` might makes right , '' and the system we have right now is one of `` lawyers abusing natural rights philosophy to decide what powers the government should have by subverting the democratic process though the Supreme Court .

I think I answered this above already , but let me expand a little more with an example . If I stand naked in front of your house and masturbate in front of your children while they play , in your libertarian ( small ' l ' ) scenario the only recourse you have is to yell at me . `` Autonomous '' is a value judgement 99.99 % of the time , it is not a scientific reality with a clear definition .

Although I am pessimistic that my idea will ever bear fruit , I am at least trying to be long on solutions also . I am truly interested if you have any improvements to make on my ideas ( I call them `` my ideas '' , but they all come from an `` average guy '' reading of the U.S. Constitution without benefit of the indoctrination of Constitutional Law academia ) . > But I have to say that I think that your solution is at least just as > bad .

When I said that `` Fractal Federalism '' resembles the U.S. constitution , I meant it and thought it was pretty clear . I should have more clearly explained that the ultimate derivation of government power is from the CONSENSUS of the people ( although not the CONSENT of every individual ; a practical observation , not a moral judgement ) . It is certainly better than having all government power derive from nine lawyers , which is the situation we have now . That is why I think the Supreme Court should be a jury court , with a different jury for each case . It is certainly not perfect ( no philosophy of government is ) , but do you still find it a repugnant idea ?

Address all letters to his address , given at the end of this document . -- Russell FROM CROSSBOWS TO CRYPTOGRAPHY : THWARTING THE STATE VIA TECHNOLOGY Given at the Future of Freedom Conference , November 1987 You know , technology -- and particularly computer technology -- has often gotten a bad rap in Libertarian cir- cles . We tend to think of Orwell 's 1984 , or Terry Gilliam's Brazil , or the proximity detectors keeping East Berlin's slave/citizens on their own side of the border , or the so- phisticated bugging devices Nixon used to harass those on his `` enemies list . '' Or , we recognize that for the price of a ticket on the Concorde we can fly at twice the speed of sound , but only if we first walk thru a magnetometer run by a government policeman , and permit him to paw thru our be- longings if it beeps . But I think that mind-set is a mistake . Before there were cattle prods , governments tortured their prisoners with clubs and rubber hoses . Before there were lasers for eavesdropping , governments used binoculars and lip-readers . Though government certainly uses technology to oppress , the evil lies not in the tools but in the wielder of the tools . In fact , technology represents one of the most promis- ing avenues available for re-capturing our freedoms from those who have stolen them . By its very nature , it favors the bright ( who can put it to use ) over the dull ( who can- not ) . It favors the adaptable ( who are quick to see the merit of the new ( over the sluggish ( who cling to time- tested ways ) . And what two better words are there to de- scribe government bureaucracy than `` dull '' and `` sluggish '' ? One of the clearest , classic triumphs of technology over tyranny I see is the invention of the man-portable crossbow . With it , an untrained peasant could now reliably and lethally engage a target out to fifty meters -- even if that target were a mounted , chain-mailed knight . ( Unlike the longbow , which , admittedly was more powerful , and could get off more shots per unit time , the crossbow required no formal training to utilize . Whereas the longbow required elaborate visual , tactile and kinesthetic coordination to achieve any degree of accuracy , the wielder of a crossbow could simply put the weapon to his shoulder , sight along the arrow itself , and be reasonably assured of hitting his tar- get . ) Moreover , since just about the only mounted knights likely to visit your average peasant would be government soldiers and tax collectors , the utility of the device was plain : With it , the common rabble could defend themselves not only against one another , but against their governmental masters . It was the medieval equivalent of the armor- piercing bullet , and , consequently , kings and priests ( the medieval equivalent of a Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Crossbows ) threatened death and excommunication , respec- tively , for its unlawful possession . Looking at later developments , we see how technology like the firearm -- particularly the repeating rifle and the handgun , later followed by the Gatling gun and more advanced machine guns -- radically altered the balance of interpersonal and inter-group power . Not without reason was the Colt .45 called `` the equalizer . '' A frail dance-hall hostess with one in her possession was now fully able to protect herself against the brawniest roughneck in any saloon . Advertise- ments for the period also reflect the merchandising of the repeating cartridge rifle by declaring that `` a man on horseback , armed with one of these rifles , simply can not be captured . '' And , as long as his captors were relying upon flintlocks or single-shot rifles , the quote is doubtless a true one . Updating now to the present , the public-key cipher ( with a personal computer to run it ) represents an equiv- alent quantum leap -- in a defensive weapon . Not only can such a technique be used to protect sensitive data in one's own possession , but it can also permit two strangers to ex- change information over an insecure communications channel -- a wiretapped phone line , for example , or skywriting , for that matter ) -- without ever having previously met to exchange cipher keys . With a thousand-dollar com- puter , you can create a cipher that a multi-megabuck CRAY X-MP ca n't crack in a year . Within a few years , it should be economically feasible to similarly encrypt voice communi- cations ; soon after that , full-color digitized video images . Technology will not only have made wiretapping obsolete , it will have totally demolished government 's control over in- formation transfer . I 'd like to take just a moment to sketch the mathemat- ics which makes this principle possible . This algorithm is called the RSA algorithm , after Rivest , Shamir , and Adleman who jointly created it . Its security derives from the fact that , if a very large number is the product of two very large primes , then it is extremely difficult to obtain the two prime factors from analysis of their product . `` Ex- tremely '' in the sense that if primes p and q have 100 digits apiece , then their 200-digit product can not in gen- eral be factored in less than 100 years by the most powerful computer now in existence . The `` public '' part of the key consists of ( 1 ) the prod- uct pq of the two large primes p and q , and ( 2 ) one fac- tor , call it x , of the product xy where xy = { ( p-1 ) * ( q-1 ) + 1 } . The `` private '' part of the key consists of the other factor y . Each block of the text to be encrypted is first turned into an integer -- either by using ASCII , or even a simple A=01 , B=02 , C=03 , ... , Z=26 representation . This integer is then raised to the power x ( modulo pq ) and the resulting integer is then sent as the encrypted message . The receiver decrypts by taking this integer to the ( secret ) power y ( modulo pq ) . It can be shown that this process will always yield the original number started with . What makes this a groundbreaking development , and why it is called `` public-key '' cryptography , '' is that I can openly publish the product pq and the number x , while keeping secret the number y -- so that anyone can send me an encrypted message , namely x a ( mod pq ) , but only I can recover the original message a , by taking what they send , raising it to the power y and taking the result ( mod pq ) . The risky step ( meeting to exchange cipher keys ) has been eliminated . So people who may not even trust each other enough to want to meet , may still reliably ex- change encrypted messages -- each party having selected and disseminated his own pq and his x , while maintaining the secrecy of his own y . Another benefit of this scheme is the notion of a `` dig- ital signature , '' to enable one to authenticate the source of a given message . Normally , if I want to send you a message , I raise my plaintext a to your x and take the result ( mod your pq ) and send that . However , if in my message , I take the plaintext a and raise it to my ( secret ) power y , take the result ( mod my pq ) , then raise that result to your x ( mod your pq ) and send this , then even after you have normally `` decrypted '' the message , it will still look like garbage . However , if you then raise it to my public power x , and take the result ( mod my public pq ) , so you will not only recover the ori- ginal plaintext message , but you will know that no one but I could have sent it to you ( since no one else knows my secret y ) . And these are the very concerns by the way that are to- day tormenting the Soviet Union about the whole question of personal computers . On the one hand , they recognize that American schoolchildren are right now growing up with com- puters as commonplace as sliderules used to be -- more so , in fact , because there are things computers can do which will interest ( and instruct ) 3- and 4-year-olds . And it is pre- cisely these students who one generation hence will be going head-to-head against their Soviet counterparts . For the Soviets to hold back might be a suicidal as continuing to teach swordsmanship while your adversaries are learning ballistics . On the other hand , whatever else a personal computer may be , it is also an exquisitely efficient copying machine -- a floppy disk will hold upwards of 50,000 words of text , and can be copied in a couple of minutes . If this were n't threatening enough , the computer that performs the copy can also encrypt the data in a fashion that is all but unbreakable . Remember that in Soviet society publicly ac- cessible Xerox machines are unknown . ( The relatively few copying machines in existence are controlled more inten- sively than machine guns are in the United States . ) Now the `` conservative '' position is that we should not sell these computers to the Soviets , because they could use them in weapons systems . The `` liberal '' position is that we should sell them , in the interests of mutual trade and cooperation -- and anyway , if we do n't make the sale , there will certainly be some other nation willing to . For my part , I 'm ready to suggest that the Libertarian position should be to give them to the Soviets for free , and if necessary , make them take them . . . and if that doesn't work load up an SR-71 Blackbird and air drop them over Moscow in the middle of the night . Paid for by private sub- scription , of course , not taxation . . . I confess that this is not a position that has gained much support among members of the conventional left-right political spectrum , but , af- ter all , in the words of one of Illuminatus 's characters , we are political non-Euclideans : The shortest distance to a particular goal may not look anything like what most people would consider a `` straight line . '' Taking a long enough world-view , it is arguable that breaking the Soviet govern- ment monopoly on information transfer could better lead to the enfeeblement and , indeed , to the ultimate dissolution of the Soviet empire than would the production of another dozen missiles aimed at Moscow . But there 's the rub : A `` long enough '' world view does suggest that the evil , the oppressive , the coercive and the simply stupid will `` get what they deserve , '' but what 's not immediately clear is how the rest of us can escape being killed , enslaved , or pauperized in the process . When the liberals and other collectivists began to at- tack freedom , they possessed a reasonably stable , healthy , functioning economy , and almost unlimited time to proceed to hamstring and dismantle it . A policy of political gradualism was at least conceivable . But now , we have patchwork crazy-quilt economy held together by baling wire and spit . The state not only taxes us to `` feed the poor '' while also inducing farmers to slaughter milk cows and drive up food prices -- it then simultaneously turns around and sub- sidizes research into agricultural chemicals designed to in- crease yields of milk from the cows left alive . Or witness the fact that a decline in the price of oil is considered as potentially frightening as a comparable increase a few years ago . When the price went up , we were told , the economy risked collapse for for want of energy . The price increase was called the `` moral equivalent of war '' and the Feds swung into action . For the first time in American history , the speed at which you drive your car to work in the morning be- came an issue of Federal concern . Now , when the price of oil drops , again we risk problems , this time because Ameri- can oil companies and Third World basket-case nations who sell oil may not be able to ever pay their debts to our grossly over-extended banks . The suggested panacea is that government should now re-raise the oil prices that OPEC has lowered , via a new oil tax . Since the government is seeking to raise oil prices to about the same extent as OPEC did , what can we call this except the `` moral equivalent of civil war -- the government against its own people ? '' And , classically , in international trade , can you imag- ine any entity in the world except a government going to court claiming that a vendor was selling it goods too cheaply and demanding not only that that naughty vendor be compelled by the court to raise its prices , but also that it be punished for the act of lowering them in the first place ? So while the statists could afford to take a couple of hundred years to trash our economy and our liberties -- we certainly can not count on having an equivalent period of stability in which to reclaim them . I contend that there exists almost a `` black hole '' effect in the evolution of nation-states just as in the evolution of stars . Once free- dom contracts beyond a certain minimum extent , the state warps the fabric of the political continuum about itself to the degree that subsequent re-emergence of freedom becomes all but impossible . A good illustration of this can be seen in the area of so-called `` welfare '' payments . When those who sup at the public trough outnumber ( and thus outvote ) those whose taxes must replenish the trough , then what possible choice has a democracy but to perpetuate and expand the tak- ing from the few for the unearned benefit of the many ? Go down to the nearest `` welfare '' office , find just two people on the dole . . . and recognize that between them they form a voting bloc that can forever outvote you on the question of who owns your life -- and the fruits of your life 's labor . So essentially those who love liberty need an `` edge '' of some sort if we 're ultimately going to prevail . We obvi- ously ca n't use the altruists ' `` other-directedness '' of '' work , slave , suffer , sacrifice , so that next generation of a billion random strangers can live in a better world . '' Recognize that , however immoral such an appeal might be , it is nonetheless an extremely powerful one in today 's culture . If you can convince people to work energetically for a '' cause , '' caring only enough for their personal welfare so as to remain alive enough and healthy enough to continue working -- then you have a truly massive reservoir of energy to draw from . Equally clearly , this is just the sort of ap- peal which tautologically can not be utilized for egoistic or libertarian goals . If I were to stand up before you tonight and say something like , `` Listen , follow me as I enunciate my noble `` cause , '' contribute your money to support the `` cause , '' give up your free time to work for the `` cause , '' strive selflessly to bring it about , and then ( after you and your children are dead ) maybe your children 's children will actu- ally live under egoism '' -- you 'd all think I 'd gone mad . And of course you 'd be right . Because the point I 'm trying to make is that libertarianism and/or egoism will be spread if , when , and as , individual libertarians and/or egoists find it profitable and/or enjoyable to do so . And probably only then . While I certainly do not disparage the concept of poli- tical action , I do n't believe that it is the only , nor even necessarily the most cost-effective path toward increasing freedom in our time . Consider that , for a fraction of the investment in time , money and effort I might expend in try- ing to convince the state to abolish wiretapping and all forms of censorship -- I can teach every libertarian who 's in- terested how to use cryptography to abolish them unilaterally . There is a maxim -- a proverb -- generally attributed to the Eskimoes , which very likely most Libertarians have al- ready heard . And while you likely would not quarrel with the saying , you might well feel that you 've heard it often enough already , and that it has nothing further to teach us , and moreover , that maybe you 're even tired of hearing it . I shall therefore repeat it now : If you give a man a fish , the saying runs , you feed him for a day . But if you teach a man how to fish , you feed him for a lifetime . Your exposure to the quote was probably in some sort of a `` workfare '' vs. `` welfare '' context ; namely , that if you genuinely wish to help someone in need , you should teach him how to earn his sustenance , not simply how to beg for it . And of course this is true , if only because the next time he is hungry , there might not be anybody around willing or even able to give him a fish , whereas with the information on how to fish , he is completely self sufficient . But I submit that this exhausts only the first order content of the quote , and if there were nothing further to glean from it , I would have wasted your time by citing it again . After all , it seems to have almost a crypto-altruist slant , as though to imply that we should structure our ac- tivities so as to maximize the benefits to such hungry beggars as we may encounter . But consider : Suppose this Eskimo does n't know how to fish , but he does know how to hunt walruses . You , on the other hand , have often gone hungry while traveling thru walrus country because you had no idea how to catch the damn things , and they ate most of the fish you could catch . And now suppose the two of you decide to exchange information , bartering fishing knowledge for hunting knowledge . Well , the first thing to observe is that a transaction of this type categorically and unambiguously refutes the Marxist premise that every trade must have a `` winner '' and a `` loser ; '' the idea that if one person gains , it must necessarily be at the '' expense '' of another person who loses . Clearly , under this scenario , such is not the case . Each party has gained some- thing he did not have before , and neither has been dimin- ished in any way . When it comes to exchange of information ( rather than material objects ) life is no longer a zero-sum game . This is an extremely powerful notion . The `` law of diminishing returns , '' the `` first and second laws of thermodynamics '' -- all those `` laws '' which constrain our possi- bilities in other contexts -- no longer bind us ! Now that's anarchy ! Or consider another possibility : Suppose this hungry Eskimo never learned to fish because the ruler of his nation-state had decreed fishing illegal . Because fish contain dangerous tiny bones , and sometimes sharp spines , he tells us , the state has decreed that their consumption -- and even their possession -- are too hazardous to the people's health to be permitted . . . even by knowledgeable , willing adults . Perhaps it is because citizens ' bodies are thought to be government property , and therefore it is the function of the state to punish those who improperly care for govern- ment property . Or perhaps it is because the state gener- ously extends to competent adults the `` benefits '' it provides to children and to the mentally ill : namely , a full-time , all-pervasive supervisory conservatorship -- so that they need not trouble themselves with making choices about behavior thought physically risky or morally `` naughty . '' But , in any case , you stare stupefied , while your Eskimo informant re- lates how this law is taken so seriously that a friend of his was recently imprisoned for years for the crime of `` pos- session of nine ounces of trout with intent to distribute . '' Now you may conclude that a society so grotesquely oppressive as to enforce a law of this type is simply an affront to the dignity of all human beings . You may go far- ther and decide to commit some portion of your discretion- ary , recreational time specifically to the task of thwarting this tyrant 's goal . ( Your rationale may be `` altruistic '' in the sense of wanting to liberate the oppressed , or '' egoistic '' in the sense of proving you can outsmart the oppressor -- or very likely some combination of these or per- haps even other motives . ) But , since you have zero desire to become a martyr to your `` cause , '' you 're not about to mount a military campaign , or even try to run a boatload of fish through the blockade . However , it is here that technology -- and in particular in- formation technology -- can multiply your efficacy literally a hundredfold . I say `` literally , '' because for a fraction of the effort ( and virtually none of the risk ) attendant to smuggling in a hundred fish , you can quite readily produce a hundred Xerox copies of fishing instructions . ( If the tar- geted government , like present-day America , at least permits open discussion of topics whose implementation is re- stricted , then that should suffice . But , if the government attempts to suppress the flow of information as well , then you will have to take a little more effort and perhaps write your fishing manual on a floppy disk encrypted according to your mythical Eskimo 's public-key parameters . But as far as increasing real-world access to fish you have made genuine nonzero headway -- which may continue to snowball as others re-disseminate the information you have provided . And you have not had to waste any of your time trying to convert id- eological adversaries , or even trying to win over the unde- cided . Recall Harry Browne 's dictum from `` Freedom in an Unfree World '' that the success of any endeavor is in general inversely proportional to the number of people whose persua- sion is necessary to its fulfilment . If you look at history , you can not deny that it has been dramatically shaped by men with names like Washington , Lincoln , . . . Nixon . . . Marcos . . . Duvalier . . . Khadaffi . . . and their ilk . But it has also been shaped by people with names like Edison , Curie , Marconi , Tesla and Wozniak . And this latter shaping has been at least as per- vasive , and not nearly so bloody . And that 's where I 'm trying to take The LiberTech Project . Rather than beseeching the state to please not en- slave , plunder or constrain us , I propose a libertarian net- work spreading the technologies by which we may seize freedom for ourselves . But here we must be a bit careful . While it is not ( at present ) illegal to encrypt information when government wants to spy on you , there is no guarantee of what the fu- ture may hold . There have been bills introduced , for exam- ple , which would have made it a crime to wear body armor when government wants to shoot you . That is , if you were to commit certain crimes while wearing a Kevlar vest , then that fact would constitute a separate federal crime of its own . This law to my knowledge has not passed . . . yet . . . but it does indicate how government thinks . Other technological applications , however , do indeed pose legal risks . We recognize , for example , that anyone who helped a pre-Civil War slave escape on the `` underground railroad '' was making a clearly illegal use of technology -- as the sovereign government of the United States of America at that time found the buying and selling of human beings quite as acceptable as the buying and selling of cattle . Simi- larly , during Prohibition , anyone who used his bathtub to ferment yeast and sugar into the illegal psychoactive drug , alcohol -- the controlled substance , wine -- was using technol- ogy in a way that could get him shot dead by federal agents for his `` crime '' -- unfortunately not to be restored to life when Congress reversed itself and re-permitted use of this drug . So . . . to quote a former President , un-indicted co- conspirator and pardoned felon . . . `` Let me make one thing perfectly clear : '' The LiberTech Project does not advocate , participate in , or conspire in the violation of any law -- no matter how oppressive , unconstitutional or simply stupid such law may be . It does engage in description ( for educa- tional and informational purposes only ) of technological processes , and some of these processes ( like flying a plane or manufacturing a firearm ) may well require appropriate li- censing to perform legally . Fortunately , no license is needed for the distribution or receipt of information it- self . So , the next time you look at the political scene and despair , thinking , `` Well , if 51 % of the nation and 51 % of this State , and 51 % of this city have to turn Libertarian before I 'll be free , then somebody might as well cut my goddamn throat now , and put me out of my misery '' -- recognize that such is not the case . There exist ways to make your- self free . If you wish to explore such techniques via the Project , you are welcome to give me your name and address -- or a fake name and mail drop , for that matter -- and you 'll go on the mailing list for my erratically-published newsletter . Any friends or acquaintances whom you think would be interested are welcome as well . I 'm not even asking for stamped self- addressed envelopes , since my printer can handle mailing la- bels and actual postage costs are down in the noise compared with the other efforts in getting an issue out . If you should have an idea to share , or even a useful product to plug , I 'll be glad to have you write it up for publication . Even if you want to be the proverbial `` free rider '' and just benefit from what others contribute -- you 're still welcome : Everything will be public domain ; feel free to copy it or give it away ( or sell it , for that matter , 'cause if you can get money for it while I 'm taking full-page ads trying to give it away , you 're certainly entitled to your capitalist profit . . . ) Anyway , every application of these principles should make the world just a little freer , and I 'm certainly willing to underwrite that , at least for the forseeable fu- ture . I will leave you with one final thought : If you don't learn how to beat your plowshares into swords before they outlaw swords , then you sure as HELL ought to learn before they outlaw plowshares too . -- Chuck Hammill THE LIBERTECH PROJECT 3194 Queensbury Drive Los Angeles , California 90064 310-836-4157 hammill @ netcom.com [ The above LiberTech address was updated December 1992 , with the permission of Chuck Hammill , by Russell Whitaker ] Those interested in the issues raised in this piece should participate in at least these newsgroups : alt.privacy alt.security.pgp comp.org.eff.talk sci.crypt A copy of the RSA-based public key encryption program , PGP 2.1 ( Pretty Good Privacy ) , can be obtained at various ftp sites around the world .

In cats , the protozoan multiplies in the intestinal cells and eggs are shed in the cat 's feces . The protozoa can cross the placenta to infect the fetus . The disease may be asymptomatic after the baby is born , or it may be very severe . Toxo may cause blindness and mental retardation . Having a cat in the same apartment should not be a problem ; however , pregnant women should not scoop or change the cat 's litterbox . In addition , whoever does empty the litterbox should thoroughly wash his/her hands before handling anything else , especially food .

Gosh , Tim , you must have seen a different live broadcast than I did . While the smoke did emerge from one place initially , it was a considerable distance from the tank , and in a very short time , fire appeared at several places a good distance apart from there . Then there 's that nagging question about why , out of all those people , only a few made any attempts to escape or save the children . If it were me , with my child , [ and I was n't committing suicide , ] I believe I would have made SOME attempt to at least save the child . As it was , at least one of the survivors was attempting to GO BACK INTO THE FIRE when they were physically removed . No one lifted a finger to bring out a child , apparently . How do you explain that ? And the two survivors who claimed to have doused the place with lantern oil and SET the fire ( no doubt on David 's orders ) . [ At least until the lawyers talked to them . ] Tim > And also , why have they not yet released the search warrant ? ? ? ? That *is* a good question .

From : FACN34B @ SAUPM00.BITNET ( zane of dhahan ) > Newsgroups : bit.listserv.christia Subject : Christianity in Crisis Date : Wed May 12 14:43:19 1993 '' Frank , first of all , thanks for all of the great Scripture verses . It was a pleasure to read them . '' MY REPLY ... You are welcome , Zane . Zane ... '' I am sure nothing that I will say will change your mind about it ... but I would like to ask you if the book in question really does anything for you . I mean , were you all caught up in the word/faith thing , but now that you have read the book you 've been rescued from all of the error and pain that will result in your Christian life ? '' MY REPLY ... ( 1 ) When I first became a Christian , I entered into the Word/Faith movement . It was easy . I was n't grounded in the Word of God and sound doctrine . When I visited Christian book stores , the cheapest books I could find to buy were the .50 and $ 1.00 books by Hagin and others . Consequently , I began receiving Hagin 's monthly magazine ( and they still send it to me ) , and also Copeland 's ( also , still sent to me ) . It was n't until I read a booklet by Jimmy Swaggart called _Hyper Faith : The New Gnosticism_ that I began to realize the teachings I were partaking of were error . I started reading the Bible more and studying more . Sure enough , Jimmy was right in many points . As part of my experience , I am alerting Christians , particularly new Christians , that these teachings are heretical and they need to do as the Bereans did in Acts 17:11 - check these teachings out with Scripture ! ( 2 ) My brother in law was involved in a Word/Faith `` cult '' in my area - it's leader is real good friends with Benny Hinn . Rather then going into much detail about this , suffice it to say he was deceived , mistreated , and has now fallen into atheism . I 'm still praying for him ( Phil . 1:6 ) . ( 3 ) The assistant pastor at the church I teach adult Sunday School in has been a ` follower ' of Copeland for 15 years . He has thousands of tapes by the Faith teachers . In the class recently , I quoted several of the teachers' heretical statements to his surprise . Since then , I 've been able to talk to him at length about these issues . ( 4 ) The leader of the Women 's Group at my church is a Benny Hinn ` fan ' . Recently , I found that she has been lending _Good Morning , Holy Spirit_ to women in the church . That prompted my quotes in Sunday School , as well as my lending CIC to people in the church . I 'm well aware of the abuses and heresies perpetrated in this movement and have an urgency in my heart and life to warn people about the heresies . What heresies ? A. Jesus became sin - took on the very nature of the devil , and became one with him . B. Jesus ' death on the cross was n't enough to atone . C. Jesus was dragged to hell after His death , was beat and abused by Satan and demons , thus finishing our atonement . Satan was ruling over Him there . D. Jesus was ` born-again ' in hell . E. Jesus died spiritually , lost His divinity , and reassumed it after the resurrection . F. We are gods . These are heresies . Documentation will be provided re : these teachings upon request . Zane ... '' Or what does it do for you ? Is it preventing you from going out and joining up with the word/faith movement which you 'd been contemplating joining for so long , but now that you 've read the book , you 've been saved from all of that ? '' MY REPLY ... It was n't _Christianity In Crisis_ that helped me ; it was a booklet by Swaggart that I mentioned above . But CIC is MUCH , MUCH better - tremendous documentation and insights . Zane ... '' I do n't have a nice Scriptural answer for why I believe it is at best un- profitable for Christians to engage in this type of activity - heresy hunting . '' MY REPLY ... Why do you call it `` heresy hunting '' ? `` Hunting '' implies it is n't readily accessible or available . This movement is the fastest growing movement in Christendom . Hagin has sold over 40 million books and booklets . Hinn has sold more books in the last couple of years than Swindoll and Dobson combined . Fred Price has the largest church in terms of seating capacity in the USA . Doesn't sound like much `` hunting '' is needed . It is Scriptural to expose doctrinal error . I gave some verses to you before . More can be given . Most of the epistles were written due to error ( doctrinal , practical ) in the churches . The early church had numerous councils to expose error and heresy . It 's not a new thing . Remember Luther ? Zane ... '' I would like to point out though , that historically those who hunt heretics often end up causing a bigger mess than the heretics ... but this is my un- documented opinion . '' MY REPLY ... ( 1 ) If you can provide documentation , it would be appreciated . ( 2 ) Read Ephesians 4:11-16 , esp . vss . 13 and 14 and tell me what causes disunity and immaturity in the body . EPH 4:13-14 till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God , to a perfect man , to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ ; that we should no longer be children , tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine , by the trickery of men , in the cunning craftiness of deceitful plotting ... . Disunity , contrary to popular opinion , is n't caused by exposing error ; it's caused by error . Zane ... '' There are many who probably give no place for seeing the Scriptures as documenting a Spiritual development or growth in its writers - but I would suggest that the fiery Paul of the letter to the Galatians mellows and matures into the one who loses all for the sake of Love in the End . '' MY REPLY ... Most scholars believe Paul wrote 2 Timothy last . Let 's examine his admonitions to Tim to ascertain how mellow he had become ... 2TI 1:13-15 Hold fast the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me , in faith and love which are in Christ Jesus . That good thing which was committed to you , keep by the Holy Spirit who dwells in us . This you know , that all those in Asia have turned away from me , among whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes . 2TI 2:15-18 Be diligent to present yourself approved to God , a worker who does not need to be ashamed , rightly dividing the word of truth . But shun profane and idle babblings , for they will increase to more ungodliness . And their message will spread like cancer . Hymenaeus and Philetus are of this sort , who have strayed concerning the truth , saying that the resurrection is already past ; and they overthrow the faith of some . 2TI 2:24-26 And a servant of the Lord must not quarrel but be gentle to all , able to teach , patient , in humility correcting those who are in opposition , if God perhaps will grant them repentance , so that they may know the truth , and that they may come to their senses and escape the snare of the devil , having been taken captive by him to do his will . 2TI 3:6-9 For of this sort are those who creep into households and make captives of gullible women loaded down with sins , led away by various lusts , always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth . Now as Jannes and Jambres resisted Moses , so do these also resist the truth : men of corrupt minds , disapproved concerning the faith ; but they will progress no further , for their folly will be manifest to all , as theirs also was . 2TI 3:12-17 Yes , and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution . But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse , deceiving and being deceived . But you must continue in the things which you have learned and been assured of , knowing from whom you have learned them , and that from childhood you have known the Holy Scriptures , which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus . All Scripture is given by inspiration of God , and is profitable for doctrine , for reproof , for correction , for instruction in righteousness , that the man of God may be complete , thoroughly equipped for every good work . 2TI 4:2-5 Preach the word ! Be ready in season and out of season . Convince , rebuke , exhort , with all longsuffering and teaching . For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine , but according to their own desires , because they have itching ears , they will heap up for themselves teachers ; and they will turn their ears away from the truth , and be turned aside to fables . But you be watchful in all things , endure afflictions , do the work of an evangelist , fulfill your ministry . 2TI 4:14-15 Alexander the coppersmith did me much harm . May the Lord repay him according to his works . You also must beware of him , for he has greatly resisted our words . Zane ... '' The picture I have of Paul is not of one who goes out of his way to destroy the ministry of wolves ... but of one who teaches the sheep , with many tears , the necessity of absolutely not allowing themselves to be transformed into wolves to protect themselves . '' MY REPLY ... ACT 20:26-31 `` Therefore I testify to you this day that I am innocent of the blood of all men . `` For I have not shunned to declare to you the whole counsel of God . `` Therefore take heed to yourselves and to all the flock , among which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers , to shepherd the church of God which He purchased with His own blood . `` For I know this , that after my departure savage wolves will come in among you , not sparing the flock . `` Also from among yourselves men will rise up , speaking perverse things , to draw away the disciples after themselves . `` Therefore watch , and remember that for three years I did not cease to warn everyone night and day with tears . Zane ... '' For all the warning Paul does , it is of note that he never once drops a name of a wolf ... . - but I will admit he cries in his beard at the end over those who have abandoned him - everyone in Asia was n't it ? '' MY REPLY ... Paul mentioned names ... 1TI 1:18-20 This charge I commit to you , son Timothy , according to the prophecies previously made concerning you , that by them you may wage the good warfare , having faith and a good conscience , which some having rejected , concerning the faith have suffered shipwreck , of whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander , whom I delivered to Satan that they may learn not to blaspheme . 2TI 1:15 This you know , that all those in Asia have turned away from me , among whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes . 2TI 2:16-18 But shun profane and idle babblings , for they will increase to more ungodliness . And their message will spread like cancer . Hymenaeus and Philetus are of this sort , who have strayed concerning the truth , saying that the resurrection is already past ; and they overthrow the faith of some . 2TI 4:10 for Demas has forsaken me , having loved this present world , and has departed for Thessalonica -- Crescens for Galatia , Titus for Dalmatia . 2TI 4:14-15 Alexander the coppersmith did me much harm . May the Lord repay him according to his works . You also must beware of him , for he has greatly resisted our words . So did John ... 3JO 1:9-10 I wrote to the church , but Diotrephes , who loves to have the preeminence among them , does not receive us . Therefore , if I come , I will call to mind his deeds which he does , prating against us with malicious words . And not content with that , he himself does not receive the brethren , and forbids those who wish to , putting them out of the church . Jesus also singled out teachings and doctrines ... REV 2:14-16 `` But I have a few things against you , because you have there those who hold the doctrine of Balaam , who taught Balak to put a stumbling block before the children of Israel , to eat things sacrificed to idols , and to commit sexual immorality . `` Thus you also have those who hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans , which thing I hate . 'Repent , or else I will come to you quickly and will fight against them with the sword of My mouth . REV 2:20-23 `` Nevertheless I have a few things against you , because you allow that woman Jezebel , who calls herself a prophetess , to teach and seduce My servants to commit sexual immorality and eat things sacrificed to idols . `` And I gave her time to repent of her sexual immorality , and she did not repent . `` Indeed I will cast her into a sickbed , and those who commit adultery with her into great tribulation , unless they repent of their deeds . `` I will kill her children with death , and all the churches shall know that I am He who searches the minds and hearts . And I will give to each one of you according to your works . Zane ... '' I question too , the purposes of those who write books and build ministries on the faults - deliberate or otherwise - of others . Maybe if they would wander around in the desert eating locust and honey , or barely cakes ... with no worldly goods at stake , money to be made , or no reputations to maintain ... I would question their motives - conscious or otherwise - less . '' MY REPLY ... I wo n't comment on this because it deals with the intangible motives of others . But even if they had bad motives , remember what Paul said ... PHI 1:15-18 Some indeed preach Christ even from envy and strife , and some also from good will : The former preach Christ from selfish ambition , not sincerely , supposing to add affliction to my chains ; but the latter out of love , knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the gospel . What then ? Only that in every way , whether in pretense or in truth , Christ is preached ; and in this I rejoice , yes , and will rejoice . Zane ... '' If we want to be true to the admonitions of Scripture - many of which you list - about protecting ourselves and the flock from wolves and winds of doctrines , I suggest we start by allowing the wolf-program in our own noetic pasture to be nailed to the Cross . '' MY REPLY ... Please explain . Zane ... '' Secondly , I suggest any heresy hunting be restricted to our own fellowships - which in the strict Scriptural sense is the local city-church . '' MY REPLY ... If heresy was not being propagated over the mass media , then it may not be needed to go mass media with the exposure . Unfortunately , heresy is being taught not just in Copeland 's church or Hagin 's or Hinn 's or Price 's , but all over the radio , in print , etc . No pastor or church leader knows what materials the sheep are feeding on outside the church . It 's imperative that leadership be made aware of this , and CIC does just that . Also , let 's examine a passage of Scripture ... * EPH 4:11 And He Himself gave some to be apostles , some prophets , some evangelists , and some pastors and teachers , * EPH 4:12 for the equipping of the saints for the work of ministry , for the edifying of the body of Christ , These ministry gifts that the Lord installs in the church are not just for one individual church , but for `` the body of Christ '' . Paul was an apostle - he traveled all over distilling his message . He was also a teacher - 1CO 4:17 For this reason I have sent Timothy to you , who is my beloved and faithful son in the Lord , who will remind you of my ways in Christ , as I teach everywhere in every church . 1CO 7:17 But as God has distributed to each one , as the Lord has called each one , so let him walk . And so I ordain in all the churches . Also - 1CO 12:28 And God has appointed these in the church : first apostles , second prophets , third teachers , after that miracles , then gifts of healings , helps , administrations , varieties of tongues . * EPH 4:13 till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God , to a perfect man , to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ ; Notice that the `` Five-Fold '' ministries are going to be around `` till '' the church is in `` unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God to a perfect man '' . This , I believe will not occur fully until the Lord Jesus returns ( see 1Cor . 13:9-12 ) . But God wants the body to continue on maturing . What hinders maturity and unity of the body ? * EPH 4:14 that we should no longer be children , tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine , by the trickery of men , in the cunning craftiness of deceitful plotting , It 's clear that false doctrine , integrated into the church `` by the trickery of men '' causes ( 1 ) disunity [ the thing we are striving for ] and ( 2 ) spiritual immaturity - the church continues in spiritual childhood when Christians are '' tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine '' . The `` Five -Fold '' ministry , of which there does not appear to be clear Scriptural denominational boundaries ( `` pastors '' appear responsible for their individual flock ) , is to deal with these doctrines ( when necessary ) in their struggle to equip the body . All believers are called to do this to a degree ... JUD 1:3-4 Beloved , while I was very diligent to write to you concerning our common salvation , I found it necessary to write to you exhorting you to contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints . For certain men have crept in unnoticed , who long ago were marked out for this condemnation , ungodly men , who turn the grace of our God into lewdness and deny the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ . Zane ... '' If you 'll notice , in Scripture the heresy hunters that went from Church to Church and area to area , were the `` bad guys '' and they went after the `` good guy '' namely Paul - who they considered to be the arch heretic . '' MY REPLY ... They were themselves heretics trying to discredit Paul who was preaching contrary to what they taught ! Zane ... '' Let 's face it , the wolves are here for a reason . And we are here for the Reason . And let 's hope the wolves become sheep , and the sheep , lambs . '' MY REPLY ... Yes ! 2TI 2:24-26 And a servant of the Lord must not quarrel but be gentle to all , ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ able to teach , patient , in humility correcting those who are in opposition , if ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~ God perhaps will grant them repentance , so that they may know the truth , and ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ that they may come to their senses and escape the snare of the devil , having been taken captive by him to do his will .

I 'm not bored either . Most people I know say that winning the second Cup was better than the first but to me nothing will ever top that first one . But I 'm every bit as excited this year and I am experiencing that inner calm to which Susan originally referred . Inner calm is not boredom . As far as the arena in general being boring , well Richard 's got that right . It 's been that way all season . I attribute it to a lot of new fans who just do n't have the same spirit and knowledge as long-time fans . At last Tuesday 's game , I overheard a man express surprise that a goaltender can get an assist . Anyone who follows sports with regularity knows that anything can happen at any time .

You should have heard Prof. McNally , from my days as an astronomy undergraduate , denouncing photon pollution . It was easy to imagine him taking practical steps to modify the sodium lamps on the street outside Mill Hill observatory with a 12-gauge shotgun : - ) However , seriously , it is possible to limit the effects of streetlights , by adding a reflector , so that the light only illuminates the ground , which is after all where you need it . As a bonus , the power consumption required for a given illumination level is reduced . Strangely enough , astronomers often seek to lobby elected local authorities to use such lighting systems , with considerable success in the desert areas around the major US observatories . At least , thats what McNally told us , all those years ago . ( British local authorities couldn ` t care less , as far as I can see ) I suppose that the `` right '' to dark skies is no more than an aspiration , but it is a worthwhile one . Illuminated orbital billboards seem especially yukky , and are presumably in the area of international law , if any , although I do find the idea of a right to bear anti-satellite weapons intriguing . -- __._____.___._____.__._______________________________________________________ __|_ . ._| ._|_._._|__| Peter Card , Joint European Torus , Abingdon | | | |_ . | | | Oxfordshire OX14 3EA UK . tel 0235-464867 FAX 464404 | | | _| | | | email pjc @ jet.uk or compuserve 100010,366 ._| | | |_ . | | | It wasnt me .

Except for ones caused by infections , the treatment is generally thyroxin pills . Hypothyroid conditions caused by infections usually disappear when the infection does ... this does n't sound like the case with your wife . Thyroxin orally does `` shut down the thyroid '' through a feedback loop involving the pituitary ( I believe ) . The pituitary `` thinks '' that the correct amount of thyroxin is being produced so it does n't have to tell the thyroid to produce more . This process is reversable ! I have Hashimoto 's thyroiditis ( an autoimmune condition ) and was on thyroxin for approx 6 mo when my endocrinologist suggested I not take the pills for 6 wks . When I was retested for thyroxin levels , they were normal . I still get tested every 6mo because the condition might reappear . The pills are safe and have very few side-affects ( & those mostly at beginning of treatment ) . Having a baby might be a problem and would at least require closer monitoring of hormone levels . Thyroxin controls energy production which explains sleepiness , coldness , and weight gain . There is also water retention ( possibly around heart ) , changes in vision , and coarser hair and skin among other things . I am not a doctor , so I 'm sure I mistated something , but the important thing is that thyroid problems are usually easily corrected and if they are n't corrected can cause problems in the rest of the body . Get a second opinion from a good endocrinologist and have him/her explain things in detail to you and your wife . - Eileen Bauer

L. acidophilus is the major bacteria in the vaginal tract and is primarily responsible for keeping the vaginal tract acidic and yeast free . Most of the commercial yogurt sold in the U.S. has a very low L. acidophilus and L. bulgaricus count . Neither of these bacteria are obligate anaerobes with are much more important in dealing with the diarrhea problem . Gordon R. has told me through e-mail that he gives his patients L. acidophilus and several different obligate anaerobes ( which set-up shop in the colon ) but he has n't told me which ones yet . The Lactobacillus genera are mostly facultative anaerobes and will set-up shop where they have access to oxygen if given a chance ( mouth , anus , sinus cavity and vagina ) . Having these good bacteria around will greatly decrease the chance of candida blooms in the anal region or the vagina . I have not proposed a systemic action for candida blooms . I know that others swear that all kinds of symptoms arise from the evil yeast blooms in the body . I 'm not ready to buy that yet . I do believe that complications at specific sites ( vagina , anal and maybe lower colon , sinus and mouth ) can result from antibiotic use which removes the competing bacteria from these sites and thus lets candida grow unchecked . Restoring the right bacterial balance is the best way ( in my opinion ) to get rid of the problem . Anti-fungals , a low carbohydrate diet and vitamin A supplementation may all help to minimize the local irritation until the good bacteria can take over control of the food supply again and lower the pH to basically starve the candida out .

You 're missing something here . There are people who convert from non-theism to theism after being brought up in a non-theist household . ( I do n't have any statistics as to how many though . That would be an interesting thing to know . ) I think that religion is a crutch . People are naturally afraid of the unknown and the unexplainable . People do n't want to believe that when they die , they are dead , finished . That there is nothing else after that . And so religion is kind of a nice fantasy . Religion also describes things we do n't know about the universe ( things science has not yet described ) and it also gives people a feeling of security ... that if they just do this one thing and everything will be ok. That they are being watched over by a higher power and its minions . This has a very high psychological attraction for quite a few people and these people are willing to put up with a few discrepancies and holes in their belief system for what it gains them . This is why I think it 's kind of useless to try too hard to convert theists to atheism . They are happy with their fantasy and they feel that other people will be happy with it too ( they ca n't accept the fact that there are people who would rather accept the harsh reality that they are running from ) . Anyway , I 'm getting kind of carried away here . But my point is that theism does n't have to be ingrained into a child 's mindset for that person to grow up as a theist ( although this happens far too often ) . Theism is designed to have its own attractions . > > _/_/_/_/ _/_/_/_/ _/ _/ * Atheist > _/ _/ _/ _/ _/ _/ _/ * Libertarian > _/_/_/_/ _/_/_/_/ _/ _/ _/ * Pro-individuality > _/ _/ _/ _/ _/ * Pro-responsibility > _/_/_/_/ _/ _/ _/ _/ Jr. * and all that jazz ...

Let 's try that again : Why was the BATF concerned about surprise when they intended to serve the warrant by knocking on the door ?

I was making the point tha > there is NO evidence of effect of gun buyback programs but hopefully if > there is any effect it may prevent injuries or deaths in one of these types > of common incidents . Saying `` hopefully the effect of policy X will be Y '' is *much* different from saying `` hopefully if there is any effect of policy X it will be Y . '' Here you 've made both statements . If the former describes a reasonably-likely outcome of policy X , then perhaps policy X is worthy of consideration - but the latter statement is not something to base policy decisions on ! > Firearms are the fifth-leading cause of unintentional deaths among children > ages 14 and under . According to groups like the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence ( formerly the National Coalition to Ban Handguns - interesting name change , do n't you think ? ) who include murder and suicide by firearms in the `` leading causes of unintentional death ) figures but *don't* include murder and suicide by other means as causes of unintentional death .

Certainly accidental deaths by any cause are serious things - but the anti-gun groups insist over and over again that accidental death by firearms is a *stastically serious problem* , and even if you do n't use these deaths as a justification for gun control , these groups do . I'm sorry if I jumped to conclusions about your reason for mentioning accidental deaths due to firearms being something that warranted concern , but in light of your statement that you are a staunch supporter of gun control measures , I think the conclusion was a reasonable one .

I thought you were waffling on your view of buyback programs with the talk of symbolic offerings and hopefully preventing accidents and heat-of-passion shootings . I have to disagree on all these counts ; I ca n't understand how a buying guns from people who are n't intending to misuse them ( obviously those who want to use guns to commit crimes are n't going to turn them in ) could be construed as a positive way for police to respond to `` interpersonal violence .

Ah , yes , the agency that considers accidental shootings of children to be such a statistical problem that a stated objective in the Healthy People 2000 document is to `` enact laws in 50 states requiring manufacturers of handguns to make the handguns more difficult to fire , minimizing the likelihood of accidental or intentional dscharge by children ? '' The agency that funded the `` study '' of DC which pronounced that the DC gun ban had saved X lives ( yes , they actually gave us a number ) on the basis of a look at the *number* of shootings rather than the *rate* of shootings ? It was n't their fault that the population of DC dropped in their `` post law '' period ... > If YOU look carefully you will see > that YOU greatly underestimate the presence of guns in the lives of youths . > The CPHV reports that 135,000 youth bring GUNS to school DAILY and that > 400,000 bring GUNS to school at least once a year .

What 's this got to do with anything ? Hell , when *I* was in elementary school I came home to an empty house with guns in it . Why is this a problem ? I did n't touch the guns - I had been taught not to . I had also been taught not to mess with the gasoline in the garage , the fuse box , the car , the knives , the oven , and the tools .

If you want the full document , ask me by mail -- Rex ] `` Questions arise as we begin to think about LOGOS and what His inner consciousness was composed of . We need to clarify the two natures of Christ briefly . The divine nature , which has existed eternally , did not undertake any essential changes during the incarnation which would cause a conflict with the attributes of God , the foremost of these being His immutability . This would mean that it remained impassable , that is , incapable of suffering and death , free from ignorance and insusceptible to weakness and temptation . In the realm of the divine nature it is better to say that the Son of God became that which was not absolute-and in Himself . The result of the incarnation was that the divine LOGOS could be ignorant and weak , could be tempted and suffer and die , not in His divine nature , but by the derivation of His possession of a human nature . This would mean that both the properties of the divine nature and the human nature are properties of the person , and therefore ascribed to the person . By this reason we can say that the person can be omnipotent , omniscient , and omnipresent , yet at the same time be also a man of limited power , knowledge , a man of sorrows , subject to human wants and miseries . There is , however , no penetration of one nature into the other . Deity can no more share the imperfections of humanity than humanity can share in the essential perfection of the Godhead . We are not to assume that there is a double personality due to the possession of the double natures . Christ 's human nature is impersonal , in that it attains self-consciousness and self-determination in the personality of the God-man . We must now differentiate between the person and the nature of the Man . Nature is defined : '' the distinguishing qualities or properties of something ; the fundamental character , disposition or temperament of a living being , innate and unchangeable . '' Nature is then , in essence , the substance possessed in common , in as such the Trinity have one nature . There is also a common nature of mankind . Personality , on the other hand , is the separate subsistence of nature , with the power of consciousness and will . It is for this reason that the human nature of Christ has not , nor ever had , a separate subsistence , that it is impersonal . LOGOS , the God-man , represents the principle of personality . It is equally important to see that self-consciousness and self-determination do not , as such , belong to the nature . It is for this reason that we can justifiably say that Jesus did not have two consciousness or two wills , but rather one . It is theanthropic , an activity of the one personality which unites in itself the human and the divine natures , being that neither the consciousness nor the will are simply human or simply divine . '' [ The quotation given above is not identified , and it 's not entirely clear to me what position Loren is taking on it . Just for clarity , let me note that the view expressed in it is one of the classic Christological heresies -- monothelitism . That 's the position that Christ 's two natures were not complete , in that there was only one will . In most cases ( which I think includes this example ) , it was the human will that was regarded as missing . Normally people who talk about Christ 's human nature as being '' impersonal '' mean it in a somewhat more abstract sense . That is , they are using `` person '' as hypostatis , not in the usual English sense of personality . In this use , the doctrine is called `` anhypostasia '' . Personally I think anhypostasia is just a more sophisticated way of denying that the Logos took on humanity fully . However it has never been formally ruled a heresy , and in fact has been held by influential theologians both ancient and modern ( e.g . Athanasius ) . But the quotation above appears to be going farther than even Athanasius went , into the realm of the overtly heretical . -- clh ]

Just christians , muslims , jews ... Pardon me ? Your ignorance cramps my conversation . Although the administrative mechanism was a strictly centralized one , the Ottoman Empire 'was a classical example of a pluralist social order . ' The 'millet system ' was the mechanism which shaped the social order of the multi-national Ottoman Empire and stood behind its continuity . As a matter of fact , because Islamic principles were in force in the Ottoman Empire , it was natural to use religious criteria to differentiate among the various communities which constituted the Empire . The 'millet ' system began to be based on ethnicity in the 19th century under the influence of nationalism . Sousa writes of the existence of thirteen communities in the Ottoman Empire in addition to the Muslim 'millet ' in 1914 . These were : ( 1 ) Greeks attached to the Orthodox Patriarchate in Istanbul ; ( 2 ) Catholics or Latins who were remnants of Genoese and Venetian merchants ; ( 3 ) Gregorian Armenians attached to a Patriarchate in Istanbul ; ( 4 ) Catholic Armenians ; ( 5 ) Syrian Catholics attached to a Patriarchate in Mardin ; ( 6 ) Chaldean Catholics attached to a Patriarchate in Mosul ; ( 7 ) Syrian Jacobites attached to a Patriarchate in Mardin ; ( 8 ) Protestants ; ( 9 ) Melchites attached to a Patriarchate in Damascus ; ( 10 ) Hebrews of two rites ; ( 11 ) Bulgarian Catholics attached to the Bulgarian Exarch ; ( 12 ) Maronites ; and ( 13 ) Nestorians . [ 1 ] Scholars who studied the pluralistic social structure outlined briefly above , concluded that the social order of the Ottoman Empire fit the framework of the 'Mosaics Theory . ' [ 2 ] [ 1 ] N.

Information of how to build an EEPROM cartidge for the vectrex is available via anonymous ftp at 'csus.edu ' . Since you 've chosen the 27C512 you are probably trying to make a 'multicart ' . To do this simply : 1 . Load the game images into the EEPROM at $ 2000 , $ 4000 , etc . ( Your EEPROM burner software may allow this or you will have to assemble the images into one file yourself with suitable gaps . ) 2 . Wire up the cartridge with the lower address bits going to the game console , and the high bits going to switches to choose between games . To directly answer your question above , the pin that 'kicks up the address' is simply another address line . For a concrete example , with the 27C512 and 8K games images , you would wire A0-A12 to the cartridge , and A13-A15 to 3 switches . The 3 switches would allow you to pick from the 8 games on the EEPROM .

McManus , National President of the John Birch Society > When McManus says , `` We have the world 's best medical care , '' I can hardly believe he 's referring to a system : 1 . That costs us 14 percent of our GDP , while there is n't a single other country in the industrialized world that spends more than 10 percent . 2 . That leaves 37 million of us with no coverage , even though all the other systems in the industrialized world cover virtually everyone . 3 . Yet , Americans rank near the bottom of the list in terms of life expectancy , childhood immunization rate , infant mortality , and many preventable diseases . 4 . We pay , on average , about $ 1000 each for MRIs . ( To put that in perspective , they cost $ 177 in Japan . ) 5 . The average US company spends over 2500 dollars a year per employee on health benefits . Seven hundred to 1500 is the range just about everywhere else . How can anyone say that such a system is the best in the world ? The only thing the USA health care system is good at is showering well-insured patients with a champagne treatment of care and outrageously overcharging for it . And the `` private '' system of insurers and paperwork is so bloated and inefficient that it itself sucks up over 100 billion dollars a year in money from every other sector of society - individuals , government , and industry . Of the < 800 billion dollars Americans threw into the bottomless pit of health care costs last year , the Consumer 's Union estimated that at least 200 billion was thrown away on overpriced , useless , and even downright harmful tests and procedures , and the most bureaucratic , regulated insurance system in the world . There are more than 1200 different private insurers in the USA . But did the '' private competition '' stimulate more efficient paperwork ? Ask any doctor who 's had to hire a full-time clerk to deal with it all ! The competition among hospitals is driving costs UP , not down . The competition among hospitals for both doctors and patients has encouraged the hospitals to traffic in expensive superfluous equipment . Spending millions on expensive machines of dubious value that spend 80 percent of the day idle is n't my idea of the world 's best health care system . Competition among specialists is driving them to perform dangerous and expensive procedures where they are very marginally helpful . I 'm especially thinking of heart surgery and some women 's surgeries like hysterectomy and Cesarean section . Sound like the world 's best health care system ? Ever notice how , every time someone tries to bring about some real change in health care , the Libbies start bashing Canada 's system ? First of all , Hillary Clinton is not advocating another Canadian system . I think that 's been made abundantly clear in the news for the last couple of months . Where did John F. McManus get that idea , anyway ? Let 's say you 're a Canadian living in a small town near the USA border . Your child needs a complicated procedure only available in city hospitals . The nearest Canadian cities are 6 hours west and 20 hours east , and there 's an American city one hour south . Which way are you going to go ? Is it because the American system is the `` best '' in the world , or just for convenience ? It still amazes me that people ca n't seem to see more than just black and white on health care reform . There are a million different ways we ould restructure the system . It 's not just a choice between total government control and total private control . I wish the people screaming `` socialized medicine '' every time soemone wants to change the current syste would INFORM THEMSELVES on health care issues . The current system sucks . I want to keep providers private but that doesn't change the fact that we will never be able to deal with the deficit if we do n't REFORM THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM . Purely private health care without any government intervention does n't work . Hillary Clinton is not thinking of nationalizing providers or evern insurers . How can you scream `` socialized medicine '' at her programs ? Do n't you even know what you 're talking about ? Ever see Clinton 's graphs of projected deficit versus year for the rest of the decade ? Notice how the line falls , then starts increasing ? Why ? I 'll give you one wild guess as to which component of spending will overwhelm us if we do n't do something about it . PEOPE JUST DOES N'T GET IT . The current health care system is a cancer which is killing our economic well-being . Costs are still rising 10 percent a year even as Americans by the tens of millions go without , or are forced into managed-care programs , which are certainly pretty socialized already if you ask me . A couple of months ago I posted a message asking any Hillary-bashers to please come forward and present ( no gimmicks , straight talk ) just how THEY would set about keeping costs down . I did n't get a single answer . The only thing I keep hearing from Libbie organizations are press releases filled with evasive platitudes like `` give health care back to the people . '' Just do you expect to do that without serious reforms ? What is it about the current system that you would change and how would that help ? How can anyone read the news , live under our system , and NOT see these faults ? How can we deal with the deficit , our cities , our educational system , our infrastrucure , AIDS , modernizing our industry , etc . if we do n't quit throwing away money which could be used to SOLVE those problems ?

When I installed SLIP on my computer , I had to configure it for my modem ( 14.4 kbs Etronics internal ) and had to supply the phone number to dial to reach the mainframe . The way it works now is that I type `` telnet uicvm '' or `` tn3270 uicvm '' ( either will work ) at the DOS prompt . UICVM is the node name of the mainframe . The program then dials the mainframe , establishes a protocol , and gives me the logon screen . `` TELNET '' and `` TN3270 '' are the names of batch files in my SLIP directory . I have been told that a kermit protocol is used for the session . PROBLEM : I would like to be able to do all this under Windows 3.1 because I hardly ever use DOS directly . SLIP will not run under Windows . I talked to the people at our computer center , and they suggested that I use a packet driver called WINPKT.COM with SLIP . They gave me instructions on how to load it before I start Windows , and how to modify the TCPSTART and TCPSTOP batch files ( in the SLIP directory ) to ensure that it would work . I did all that and I could run SLIP from Windows , but there were other problems . For one thing , SLIP would not hang up the phone when I exited . I had to run my communi- cations program to hang up the phone or reboot the computer when that did n't work . For another , there were too many errors . It often took me 3-4 tries to connect to the mainframe . Our computer center does not support SLIP under Windows , so I ca n't keep going back to them with more questions . QUESTION : Is there some other SHAREWARE package that will run under Windows and do what SLIP is supposed to do ? I need a package that is not too expensive , which is why I am looking for shareware . I have heard that there are regular commercial packages that do all this , but they cost hundreds of dollars . These are the main requirements : 1 . Must be able to run under Windows 3.1 2 . Must allow VT100 and IBM TN3270 terminal emulation 3 . Must allow ftp file transfers , since that 's the only kind the mainframe allows . No Y-modem or Z-modem etc . I believe the ftp transfers are made through a kermit protocol , but I 'm hazy about that . A subsidiary feature ( that would be nice to have ) if it 's a true Windows program ( rather than a DOS program modified to run under Windows ) is the ability to run the session in a window concurrently with other applications and to cut and paste between the telnet session and other applications . Any information received is appreciated . Pankaj Saxena u09416 @ uicvm.uic.edu

Firstly , an aside : I agree that the weakness exists , but I have a lot of trouble believing that it represents a difficulty in real life . Given : 1. the purpose of the one-time pad is to give unbreakable security , and the expense of key distribution etc. , imply that the clients really do want that level of security 2 . These same people want to keep P a secret I find it hard to believe that Eve might happen to have a copy of P lying around . ( I am aware that the same argument applies to Eve knowing even a small part of the message , but Eve must know EXACTLY where ( which bytes ) in C her known susequence starts , or the result will be garbled . I find this at least as surprising . ) Back to the question : If I had the resources to use a one-time-pad for such transmissions , I would also append a Message Authentication Code to the message , using up the next bits of the one-time-pad as the key perhaps . Your original question basically asked whether there was any way to authenticate the message with the same degree of security as the Pad itself provided , and I do n't know the answer . However , I would propose the following for discussion . Alice and Bob have an arbitrary number of secret , random bits to share , which Eve does n't know . She finds them out ( effectively ) by knowing some P and the corresponding C. It is the fact that they CORRESPOND that causes the problem . If a message authentication code was to be created using some one-time-pad operation such that Eve could not know which parts of the MAC were affected by which parts of the input , she would be unable to forge a MAC to correspond . What is required is a non-linear combiner of parts of the message . ( Non-linear so that simply xoring or subtracting or whatever doesn't have exactly the same effect ) . Now , at the end of the encrypted message C , Alice appends a n-bit MAC computed as follows ( S2 means the next full chunk of the one time pad ) : 1. compute C2 = P xor S2 , and pad to an n-bit boundary with more of S 2. break C2 into n-bit chunks 3. set MAC to 0 ( initialisation vector ) 4. for i in each chunk sequentially set MAC = MAC NLOP C2 [ i ] At the end of this process MAC is the Message Authentication Code . ( Bob verifies the MAC in the obvious manner ; he recovers the plaintext P , then uses some more of his pad to reproduce the MAC in the same manner . ) NLOP is the non-linear operator , and there is the rub . The simplest non-linear operator I can think of is an S-box ; that is , have a fixed ( even published ) permutation of the n-bit integers , an indexable table called Sbox , and use : x NLOP y = x xor Sbox [ y ] . Practically speaking , I think this solves your problem , as Eve never sees the intermediate output C2 , and hence ca n't deduce S2 or perform any valid substitution on it . Also practically speaking , you want the MAC to be fairly large , say 32 bits , but you might not want a 4 gigabyte ( say ) S-box , so you might work on 4 byte-sized S-boxes , but I think that is an irrelevant detail for the discussion at hand .

The serious overreaction ought to be worth a couple of points , not to mention the bit condemning everthing the flamee might ever say . The non sequitur about guns and helmets is just the proper flourish . I personally am of the opinion that there are two types of good flames . The first does trade `` quality , '' in the sense you mention , for heat . This has a certain surprise value and if done correctly , which I contend was done above , is reasonably entertaining . While it is true that the flame I posted does not mention anyone 's habitual velocity , friends , dinner , or entertainment , it says what it needs to with the appropriate flair and it is short . The weakness of this type of flame is actually that it can easily be taken too far , at which point it becomes trite and boring . ( Witness the Infante thread recently ... . ) The other type of flame , which you seem to be glorifying above , has a few weaknesses as well . In the first place , it can get verbose and tedious in the extreme , particularly if the reader does not already strongly identify with one side or the other . In the second , discussing someone's personal qualities , habits , and so forth can quickly become libelous . ( Or is that slanderous ? I can never remember the difference . ) This leads to a proliferation of lawyers , which is widely regarded as a BAD THING . Finally , introducing polysyllabic words is problematic . I ca n't haul my big dic . around on my bike , and it would be bad form to use a word which actually turned out to have a meaning , especially one which ran counter to my use and flamage in general . In summary , Blaine , your score for that flame is incorrect . While it may be the wunder-flame , the weaknesses you point out are not necessarily weaknesses , and your suggested corrections are not always useful nor applicable . You also probably could n't outrun a tennis ball with a flatulent dog stapled to your posterior , and I 'll bet you and your motorcycle lean to the outside while turning .

If that were the case , one would expect a few of that culture 's positives to be discussed with regard to the issue at hand .

I agree with you . But I also feel that when a culture feels it is confronted by another group that wishes to see that culture `` disassembled '' , the first culture has little choice but to *try* to secure its `` survival '' as well as maintain its moral center . Since the culture is not about to turn away from *either* the matter of its survival or the valuing of its moral principles , it has the virtually impossible job of `` balancing '' . To discuss Israel 's faults and `` crimes '' without *any* recognition of this circumstance and *reality* it faces is a conscious decision based on the discussant 's political biases , NOT on an honest and empathetically open understanding of the situation . The same applies to those who attempt to paint the Palestinian movement as `` all bad '' and dispense with considerations of the *reality* facing them . > > > That certainly describes Elias , > > since he has no intention of recognizing that , alongside the Palestinian > > experience and perspective , there exists also that of Israelis . > > He might not want to recognize that .

You beg the question by centering on the symptoms while the issue of `` self-hating '' addresses the motivations . I certainly feel that anyone who expends so much effort inflating , distorting and robbing human context from aspects of his/her own culture is reflecting a degree of dislike for it . Since bits of that culture are bound , due to his/her upbringing , to be a part of him/her , a bit of self- dislike seems likely to be mixed in somewhere . > > > > > > > > `` Who is a Jew ?

As you well know , this process of *blaming the other* for the morally questionable actions one side is forced ( by the `` other '' , of course ) to take is thoroughly practiced by **both sides** . If you are only hearing the pro-Israeli crowd 's self-supporting arguments , that may be due to the fact that you are not listening for anything else . *I* certainly hear the similarly distorting pro-Palestinian/pro-Arab element in *this* newsgroup ( as well as in soc.culture.arabic ) . > There is always and excuse .

However , in my response to the initial discussion above between Davidsson and those opposing his presentations , I saw Davidsson carefully putting academic frills around a blatantly one-sided series of I-hate/dislike- '' them '' , yesIdo , yesIdo , yesIdo . I did *not* find the approach of those opposing Davidsson to be centered *at all* on a denigration and denial of the `` other side '' . I certainly do wonder if the degree to which Davidsson 's views on the Middle East have distorted is connected to his dislike and rejection of his jewish lineage . Having said this , however , I agree with you that this constant accusing others of being `` self-hating '' jews seems pointless .

Sounds just about right to me . Its the minimum amount of force that I would consider necessary to serve a warrant on the talk.politics.guns annual dinner . Michael Hesseltine ordered the use of over 5000 crack troops including members of the parachute regiment to remove approx 250 hippy peace protestors on a site where they wanted to install cruise missiles . He even turned up in a flack jacket to monitor the proceedings . Just about the most dangerous tool the women possesed was a tin opener . That single action probably cost him the position as Prime Minister . One of the elders of my church got arrested in that heroic action by the forces of Toryism . Hesseltine ever after was something of a national joke . Phill Hallam-Baker

But do we write about historical ownership of any place - Palestine , Pakistan , Cyprus , Aegean Islands ( and the oil that may lie beneath them ) , whatever - for any reason other than justification for stomping others ? DOES IT TRULY MATTER whose ancestor lived where 20 , 200 , or 2000 years ago ? More than how you treat the land and each other ? Who is wise enough to decree that a person 's right to life , liberty and pursuit of happiness in a particular place depends on accidents of birth ? Who can even be sure about the precise tracks of the sperm that birthed the people we wish to despise ? IMHO , the American Indians have it right . We belong to the earth , it does not belong to us . Failure to understand that is a good way to cause lossage all the way around . My guess is that once we trash our environment sufficiently we shall die along with it - the baby eating and killing its mother , then dying for lack of milk . Death and disease do not respect national boundaries , not as toxins , disease vectors , lost farmland/wetlands/forest cover/water supplies , nor any other way . When we fight over which national group owns which piece of turf , we are merely contending for the best vantage point from which to kill others , `` our '' land and eventually ourselves . That is something of which to be proud . Very proud . Makes me glad to be human . I 'm not mindlessly rejecting all nationalism . Maybe it 's fair to ask whether a recent immigrant deserves a share of the infrastructure that all _my_ ancestors ( hah ! ) labored to produce . But it 's an artificial distinction : is the recent immigrant , even a refugee , less likely to contribute to the next generation 's legacy than anyone else ? [ In history the reverse is often the case : recent immigrants strive hardest . If nothing else , they fill open eco ( l/n ) ogic niches . ] Then again , my tribe is infinitely better than your tribe , so I can understand you all have nothing but plot to knock me off . While I , of course , will make sure it does n't happen , even if I must shoot Muslim infants ( or bash Jewish ones against the walls of schoolhouses ) to do so . That 'll prove my moral superiority , by golly , as well as the rightness of my cause . Clearly , there is no higher purpose in life than killing others because they are not like you . I would never get in the way of such fun . Let 's see : soc.culture.turkish - Why do n't you Turks go back to Lake Baikal where you came from , and leave the land to the Greeks , who stole it fair and square from the Scythians ? soc.culture.pakistan - Why do n't you guys redistribute yourselves over India , as God meant for you to do ? soc.culture.jewish , soc.culture.arabic - we stick together , fight together , die together . We are brothers , and inseparable . talk.politics.mideast - oh well , had to be there . Oded [ Planning on being a Scythian irredentist , as soon as I finish my present assignment . ] P.S . : I ca n't get a semi-decent death threat anymore ?

Atheists and agnostics , I would imagine , but yes , that was my point . An atheist would theoretically be just as ill-equipped to study the philosophy of religion as a Christian , and yet there is a persistence of atheists among the ranks of philosophers . Therefore , the conflict between one's religious beliefs ( or lack thereof ) and the ability to be a philosopher must not be as great as you assert .

As opposed to science practiced by theists ? Be careful here . Science does have a built-in defence against faith and dogma : skepticism . Unfortunately , it is not foolproof .

Ideally , this is true . In reality , though , you have to acknowledge that scientists are human . Scientists have egos and biases . Some scientists assume a particular theory is true , refuse to admit the flaws in that theory because of ego problems or whatever , and proceed to spend their time and money trying to come up with absolute proof for the theory .

Not really . I agree that we spent far too much money on the Waco crisis ( $ 7,500,000 I believe ) , especially considering the outcome . My point was that mass suicides in the U.S. are rare ( Jonestown was in Guyana , incidentally , although we footed the bill for the clean-up ) , and the U.S. has far more important issues to address . Compare the number of U.S. citizens who have died in mass suicides with , say , the number of U.S. soldiers who died during one week of the Vietnam War and you will see my point . -- -- - __ _______ -- - ||| Kevin Marshall \ \/ /_ _/ Computer Science Department ||| ||| Virginia Tech \ / / / marshall @ csugrad.cs.vt.edu ||| -- - Blacksburg , Virginia \/ /_/ ( 703 ) 232-6529 -- -

I currently deal basically with hardware from 3 vendors - Apple , DEC , and SGI - and thus tend to monitor the groups about those vendor's hardware .

From : Ed Hew < edhew @ xenitec.on.ca > Subject : biz.sco . * newsgroups/mlists FAQ ( periodic posting ) Organization : XeniTec Consulting Services , Kitchener , ON , CANADA Summary : how to subscribe ( and why ) Keywords : biz , sco , newsgroups , mailing lists Lines : 123 Evolution of SCO newsgroups and Mailing Lists -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Many readers enjoyed the opportunity to obtain and contribute useful information on SCO Open Desktop since 1990 through the ancestral USENET newsgroup sco.opendesktop or it 's companion mailing list . Similarly , there was a demonstrated need for an information and discussion forum for SCO products in general . With the increasing demand for accessibility and for additional SCO newsgroups , many current contributors including those who have been active in circulating SCO related newsgroups and mailing lists felt that the readership would be best served by creating a biz.sco . * hierarchy to improve propagation ( and hence availability ) worldwide . biz.sco . { opendesktop , general , announce } were newgrouped May 1 , 1991 in accordance with accepted procedure within `` biz '' . Given the content , this change relocated the `` opendesktop '' newsgroup to a more proper place within the established usenet news hierarchy and adds the new `` announce '' and `` general '' groups . On Aug 1 , 1991 , the former `` sco-list @ uunet.uu.net '' became `` scogen '' in keeping with established biz.sco . * naming conventions . biz.sco.binaries and biz.sco.sources were newgrouped on June 1 , 1992 to respectively accommodate SCO Xenix , UNIX and OpenDesktop specific binaries and source code . The binaries and sources news groups are moderated , with moderator and submissions information and policy outlined in the periodic imformational postings in those newsgroups . Respecting USENET etiquite , these newsgroups are _not_ gated to mailing lists , but are archived on several nuucp and ftp hosts . biz.sco.magazine was newgrouped Dec 14 , 1992 , to provide a discussion area for the readers , writers and publishers of SCO Magazine . Subject to the USENET NEWS hierarchies carried by your upstream feed , you are now able to subscribe to the following : Newsgroup mailing list subscription -- -- -- -- - -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - biz.sco.opendesktop scoodt-request @ xenitec.on.ca biz.sco.general scogen-request @ xenitec.on.ca biz.sco.announce scoann-request @ xenitec.on.ca biz.sco.sources < none > biz.sco.binaries < none > biz.sco.magazine scomag-request @ xenitec.on.ca You are _strongly_ encouraged to obtain these newsgroups via USENET NEWS mechanisms vrs mail . Anyone having difficulty arranging a news feed for these newsgroups is welcome to email the undersigned and I 'll do my best to help . We also offer all required software in source code form via anonymous FTP and UUCP , as do many archive sites . If , after having explored all options , you are still unable to receive biz.sco . * as news , you may subscribe to the mailing lists . The 4 discussion newsgroups are bi-directionally gated to companion mailing lists , so anyone not having access to NEWS but who does have a UUCP or Internet mail feed can still participate fully using email . Mailing list subscribers should send their request to the appropriate `` mailing list subscription '' address above , including in the message body : Add : subscriber_address -eg- Add : your_logname @ site.do.main -or- Add : up ! stream ! yoursite ! your_logname Inclusion of an alternative working bang-path relative to a well know major functional site might prove beneficial . Deletions are handled the same way , simply substitute `` Delete : '' for `` Add : '' , ensuring that you use the exact same address you subscribed with . Mailing list subscribers receive `` how to post to the mlist '' article submission information when their request is processed . If you do n't receive an acknowledgement within a few days , check your routing and try a test message via xenitec.on.ca back to your host . In such cases , it 's likely that someone , somewhere , is bouncing mail replies to you ( and would do the same with mailing list traffic ) , and you 'll want to resolve your connectivity problem before trying to subscribe again . Mailing list subscriptions are free , subject to whatever arrangements you may have with the site ( s ) feeding you . Should you receive no response or experience a sudden and prolonged drop to zero volume on one of the mailing lists , this indicates that we are no longer able to find a working route to your site . We loose a handful of subscribers this way each month . If this happens to you , please email us your known working bang-path relative to a major site . What 's in the newsgroups ( and mailing_lists where applicable ) : biz.sco.opendesktop : Technical questions and answers and informative postings relating to past , present , and future implementations of the SCO OpenDeskTop operating environment and it 's various bundled components . biz.sco.general : Questions , answers and comments on SCO products in general , and of course resulting discussions . biz.sco.announce : SCO and SCO Developer product announcements of interest to current and future users of SCO products , and to SCO developers , resellers and distributors . ( moderated , followups directed to biz.sco.general ) . biz.sco.sources : SysV or BSD source code for useful programs and utilities , modified to compile and run with various incarnations of SCO Xenix , UNIX , and/or OpenDesktop . biz.sco.binaries : Binary packages compiled from SCO compatible source code , often from source posted in biz.sco.sources and often installable using the SCO `` custom '' utility . biz.sco.magazine : Interaction between the SCO Magazine readers , writers and publishers . You should always endeavour to post your article to the most applicable newsgroup . For example , posting your ODT question to the `` general '' newsgroup will preclude your question and answers to it from being saved in the public ODT archives . Appropriate crossposting is allowed . The undersigned is solely responsible for administration of the biz.sco namespace .

Date : Mon , 22 Mar 1993 06:50:14 GMT Lines : 53 Research has shown that the majority of the time that the United States ' 30 to 35 million personal computers are on , they are not actively being used . In addition , 30 to 40 percent are left running at night and on weekends . Computer equipment is now the fastest growing private-sector use of electricity . Computers alone are believed to account for five percent of commercial electricity consumption , and may account for ten percent by the year 2000 . If you are one of those who leave them on after you 're done , it would be a big environmental benefit if you would just TURN IT OFF when you 're not using it . It only takes a second or two to do . Also , the majority of the power your computer uses is not consumed by the computer itself , but by the monitor . If you ca n't turn the computer off , then please just TURN OFF THE MONITOR . The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has formed an alliance with computer manufacturers to promote the introduction of energy- efficient PCs that `` power down '' automatically when not being used and thus reduce the air pollution caused by power generation . These new computers will save enough electricity to power both Vermont and New Hampshire and save up to 1 billion U.S. dollars in annual electricity bills . Look for the special EPA `` Energy Star '' logo when you buy computers . They should be available in one to two years . According to the EPA studies , the energy saved will prevent CO2 emissions of 20 million tons annually , the equivalent of five million automobiles . Also , 140,000 tons of SO2 and 75,000 tons of nitrogen oxide emissions will be saved ; these are the major pollutants responsible for acid rain . Please do your part ... be responsible .

I see a lot of computers advertized on the net , and my friend just had been releived of his machine = all the net-computer ads are for stolen computers ? Where did you learn logic ? As for the seats , they were replaced by a much harder ( literally ) Celica GTS seats due to my back problem . That is why I had to reuse the MR2 brackets and that 's why the MR2 seats I sell are attached to Celica brackets . Please in the future think before you make allegations like the above . It hurts .

As to the last comment , I certainly realize that it was not intended to sound that way . I am still trying to understand *how* a spiritual being colud truly be one and three at the same time . All of the descriptions of this are either Platonic or sound like special pleading ( sort of , '' they appear to be three seperate beings in all ways , but really they are one , trust me '' ) . Neither of these is acceptible to me . The fact is , so far the only descriptions of the trinity that makes any *sense* to me are the modalistic ones , such as Modalistic Monarchianism or `` Economic Trinitarianism '' . [ I can accept that the three aspects are intrinsic to the nature of God , so I perhaps lean more towards the latter ] . I am trying , here , to see if anybody can come up with another description that is both orthodox and believable . -- sarima @ teradata.com ( formerly tdatirv ! sarima ) or Stanley.Friesen @ ElSegundoCA.ncr.com [ I fear orthodox theologians have been overly in love with paradox , to the extent that well-meaning people think they 've just flat-out confused . There 's no problem with things being both 3 and 1 , e.g . if the 3 are different parts of the 1 . Father , Son , and Holy Spirit are n't exactly parts of God , because parts are things distinguished by physical separation . All three Persons are omnipresent , so they are obviously are n't physically separate . But they 're in some way different aspects , modes , or whatever , of one God . If you accept economic trinitarianism , it 's possible that you do n't have any substantive difference with the standard view .

Also , as was observed at : the very top of this post , Mary had to be free from sin in order to be the : mother of Jesus , who was definitely without sin . If the mother of Jesus had to be without sin in order to give birth to God , then why did n't Mary 's mother have to be without sin in order to give birth to the perfect vessel for Jesus ? For that matter , why did n't Mary 's grandmother have to be without sin either ? Seems to me that with all the original sin flowing through each person , the need for the last one ( Mary ) to have none puts God in a box , where we say that He could n't have incarnated Himself through a normal human being . My God is an all powerful God , Who can do whatever suits His purpose . This includes creating a solar system and planet earth with the appearance of great age ; providing a path through the Red Sea for the children of Israel that does not depend on the existence of a ridge of high ground and a wind blowing at the right speed and direction ; and the birth of Himself from a normal sinful person without being tainted by her original sin . I see far too much focus on the `` objects '' of religion and not nearly enough on the personal relationship that is available to all believers with the Author of our existence , without the necessity of having this relationship channeled through conduits to God in the form of Mary , Apostles and a Pope . : Note that the idea of Mary being conceived without Original Sin , i.e . the : Immaculate Conception , is distinct from the idea of Mary not having sinned : during her lifetime , which is a separate doctrine and , I believe , also : held by the Catholic Church . If Mary was born without original sin , and did n't sin during her lifetime , how is she any different from Jesus ? This means the world has had two perfect humans : one died to take away the sins of the world ; the other gave birth to Him ? I would certainly want to see some scriptural support for this before I would start praying to anyone other than God . Everything I have ever read from the bible teaches me that Jesus was and is the only sinless Lamb of God , not His mother , grandmother ... ... .. : Hope this is useful to you .

On the other hand , I would suppose it does has some motivation behind it . Apparently the idea is to poke fun at religion , but there is presumably some sort of reasoning behind it . As an argument , this statement is worthless . Presuming the Qur'an is a perfect religious text ( whatever that might be ) there is still plenty of room for disagreement about its implications for issues far from essentials . I 've already responded to the question of how a judgment might be made between two people who in fact _do_ disagree about Islam , which doesn't presume anything about the Qur'an other than its having sufficient clarity for all important disputes about the basic principles of Islam . This hardly constitutes a claim that no two people could have disagreements about _all_ issues relevant to Islam . Gregg

This means that if you server return a response like the following -adobe-helvetica-medium-o-normal -- 0-0-75-75-p-0-iso8859-1 You can ask for the follwogin : -adobe-helvetica-medium-o-normal -- 14-100-90-90-p-0-iso8859-1 and it will generate it for you .

I disagree with what to tout , although I agree that the space program is inherently a good thing . Most people today only care about `` what will it cost me ? '' and `` what 's in it for me ? '' and could care less about whether something is simply worthwhile in and of itself . Our society has become increasingly geared toward the short-term ( which you could read as NOW ! ) . They could n't care less about next week , much less next century . They want something to show for the expenditure and they want it *now* . I think we *should* tell them about the things that they are using now that are spinoffs of the space program . That is the only way you can *prove* its worth to *them* - and they vote and pay taxes too . The continued existence of the space program relies upon that money . just my $ .02 BTW : do n't forget Velcro ... bcnu - John Gladu Systems Support Center -- Baylor College of Medicine INTERNET : jgladu @ bcm.tmc.edu | VOICE : ( 713 ) 798-7370 US MAIL : One Baylor Plaza , Houston , Texas 77030 .opinions expressed are just that.obviously .

San Diego Lines : 33 > Any attempts to make homosexuals > feel unwelcome because of our discomfort with homosexuality is incompatible > with Christianity .

However ... > Does Jesus need > us to screen out those guilty of a particular sin . Do we really mistrust > Jesus when he says he can forgive any sin ? A big part of the problem is that many of the homosexuals and people advocating acceptance of homosexuality in churches do not consider ( active ) homosexuality a sin . I do n't often see the attitude of '' forgive me and I will try to change '' . Instead I see `` there 's nothing wrong with my life and I can be a good Christian , so it must be you who have an illness because you do n't accept me '' . Christians can and will accept homosexuals , just as they will accept *any* sinner . Sure , it may be natural to some people to be homosexual - but it is also perfectly natural for everyone to sin ! I was born with a desire to sin , but I work to prevent myself from sinning . It's much less common now , but I *still* have urges to lash out in anger . There also may not be a sudden disappearance of sinful desires ( or ever ! ) , so it is sad to see people leave the church when they are discouraged that they are still homosexual after several years . -- Darin Johnson djohnson @ ucsd.edu `` Particle Man , Particle Man , doing the things a particle can ''
