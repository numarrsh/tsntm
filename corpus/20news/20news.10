If all you care about is belief in a supernatural deity , and have nothing to say about behaviour , then belief in a supernatural being is your criterion . But once you start talking about behaviour , then someone 's suscept- ibility to be led by bad people into doing bad things is what you are - I assume - worried about . And in that area , what you care about is whether someone is sceptical , critical and autonomous on the one hand , or gullible , excitable and easily led on the other . I would say that a tendency to worship tyrants and ideologies indicates that a person is easily led . Whether they have a worship or belief in a supernatural hero rather than an earthly one seems to me to be beside the point . jon .

People who `` just > follow orders '' have tortured and killed others in very large numbers , > and protest their innocence afterwards . The basic question here is `` how do I know what I am supposed to do ? '' This is true in every situation that comes up . Some people do not think about it at all and merely follow their impulses . I claim that is just as dangerous as `` following authority '' . I could site sexually transmitted diseases , drug abuse , all manner of criminal activity , the savings and loan scandal , car accidents , eggs thrown at my house , all are examples of people not `` following authority '' . I could easily argue that in the evil examples you gave the problem was a leader not following _his_ authority and doing what he wanted . Of course , where is the top of the chain ? Therein lies our search . > When your authority starts telling you to do things , you should ask > questions . Except for situations of pressing need ( `` I said shut the > hatch because the submarine is filling with water ! `` ) , any reasonable > authority should be able to give at least some justification that you > can understand . I do n't think it 's as simple as you are claiming . `` Pressing need '' is ambiguous . Should I recycle or not ? Realize that I have four kids who , despite being very precocious of course , are very tiring with their constant lack of understanding the tremendous knowledge I wish to impart to them . > Just be sure to listen when authority answers . Ahh ! An ironic ending . The irony I was implying in my initial pithy retort to the bumper sticker cliche `` Question Authority '' was that I was questioning the authority of the person telling me to question authority . It seems there is a certain segment of society that finds meaning only in being different , only in rebelling , forsaking everything for the sake of freedom . I question their integrity and fortitude . There is another freedom that comes from doing a task correctly . Different people are at different levels of development in different areas . Part of the challenge of life is to find the right authorities to follow , we ca n't know everything about everything . Often when learning a new skill or subject I will follow the teacher , perhaps blindly . Only when I have learned enough to ask appropriate questions should I question him , only when I have developed my skills enough should I challenge him . Once again , how do I know when I get to those stages ? If you have to be told to question authority , perhaps you should n't .

I 've eaten Chinese food for ages and never had problems . I went with some Chinese Malaysian friends to a swanky Chinses rest . and they ordered lots of stuff I had never seen before . The only thing I can remember of that meal was the first course , scallops served in the shell with a soy-type sauce . I thought , `` Well , I 've only had scallops once and I was sick after but that could have been a coincidence '' . That night as I sat on the bathroom floor , sweating and emptying my stomach the hard way , I decided I would never touch another scallop .

On a tour hosted by JPL Chief Scientist Dr. Moustafa Chahine and Merle McKenzie , manager of the International Affairs Office , Hawking visited a variety of facilities , met with Lab Director Dr. Edward Stone and various project scientists and managers , and felt `` like royalty , '' he said . Hawking , whose theories attempt to explain the origin of distant galaxies , black holes and alternate dimensions , wanted to re-visit JPL , he explained , `` because while I 'm most interested in those things in space that are farther away , I know that here is where the first steps are taken . '' Hawking , who was accompanied by his family , two graduate students and his aides , began the tour in von Karman Auditorium , as David Evans , deputy assistant Lab director in the Office of Flight Projects , and Dr. Arden Albee , Mars Observer 's project scientist , briefed him on current and past flight projects . Voyager was pointed out to him , with special attention paid to a gold plate with a series of engraved images . Should extraterrestrial life stumble upon the spacecraft , Evans noted , they would find a variety of images that would explain something of Earth . The professor asked if we were still communicating with the spacecraft , and Evans affirmed that we are . Using a model of Mars Observer , Albee spent several minutes describing the project and the spacecraft 's features . In answer to a question from Hawking , Chahine described a proposed drag-free satellite , but confirmed that at this point , `` it 's only a concept . '' Chahine , who had met Hawking at Caltech about five years before , described the professor as `` a living miracle of the power of the brain . He 's miraculous , and he has such a good sense of humor . '' The next stop , a demonstration on scientific data visualization in Section 384 's Digital Image Animation Lab , entertained and delighted the group , as everyone donned goggles to view 3-D images of Mars . Project Scientist Dr. Eric De Jong showed off the latest data -- a comet that had only recently been discovered in orbit close to Jupiter . Hawking was curious about its composition , and as he was shown how images are developed , he asked several questions on their interpretation . Norman Haynes , ALD , Office of Telecommunications and Data Acquisition , briefed the professor on the Space Flight Operations Facility , and then Hawking spoke with Stone . The day ended with two technical discussions of particular interest to the professor . Technical Group Leader Dr. Frank Estabrook and Senior Research Scientist Hugo Wahlquist described a three-spacecraft gravity wave experiment , currently under way . Then planetary astronomer Dr. Richard Terrile explained the philosophy and plans for extra solar system planetary detection . The Hawking party , which had been visiting Southern California for five weeks , was headquartered at Caltech , and planned to leave for England within a few weeks after the Lab tour . Upon departing , the Cambridge-based scientist promised Chahine that he would return to JPL for another visit . # # # ___ _____ ___ /_ /| /____/ \ /_ /| Ron Baalke | baalke @ kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov | | | | __ \ /| | | | Jet Propulsion Lab | ___| | | | |__ ) |/ | | |__ M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand /___| | | | ___/ | |/__ /| Pasadena , CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and |_____|/ |_|/ |_____|/ | part vegetable .

From : dotsonm @ dmapub.dma.org ( Mark Dotson ) Subject : Fragmentation Organization : Dayton Microcomputer Association ; Dayton , Ohio X-Newsreader : TIN [ version 1.1 PL8 ] Lines : 49 The primary problem in human nature is a `` fragmentation of being . '' Humans are in a state of tension , a tension of opposites . Good and evil are the most thought provoking polarities that come to mind . The Bible provides us with many examples of the fragmentation of being . The warring opposites within us are a product of man's rebellion against God , which is described so vividly in the pages of the Scriptures . Man was created with the order to become a god . Those were the words of St . Basil in the fourth century . What he was trying to say was that God created man to be a partaker of the divine nature . In the Eastern Orthodox Church , this is called `` theosis , '' or `` deification . '' One can also say that man was created to be whole , i.e . spirit , soul , and body operating in unison . The story of Adam and Eve is a picture of the archetypal humans before obtaining moral consciousness . Theirs was a harmonious relationship with each other , the world , and the Creator . That innocent harmony was shattered when they disobeyed God , their natural wholeness falling apart into two seemingly irreconcilable halves . Immediately , guilt and fear was manifested in their lives . They become bound to hardship , toil , and suffering . This is symbolized in their exile from the paradisiac state . The beast in the jungle does not possess moral consciousness . If it were to receive this self-awareness , the knowledge of good and evil , its paradisiac state would also be destroyed . Was it the intention of the Creator to leave man in this state of innocence all the days of his existence on earth ? Or was the gaining of self-awareness carefully staged by God , who did not desire that His masterpiece , mankind , be a blissful idiot ? God must have known that , for mankind to achieve any kind of moral value , he must pass through a confrontation with the opposites . There is no other way to achieve union with God . Jesus Christ is the answer to the problem of the warring polarities . He was the perfectly integrated individual , reconciling the opposites , and making it possible for us to be integrated , i.e . to become God , not in His essence , but in His energies . The opposites is THE Christian problem . The Apostle Paul describes it with the utmost precision in Romans 7:15-24 . And he follows with the answer to his dilemma in vs 25 . Mark

The Mets ( HOW ABOUT DOC 'S PERFORMANCE TODAY ? ! ! ! ! ! ) have reinserted the Mets patch on the shoulder , and changed the Mets insgnia on the front of the jersey . To my knowledge it is the first time that has been changed since 1962 , and it reminds me a little of the Dodger logo .

( Phillies , Reds , Expos , White Sox , Padres , etc . ) and the once bright colors have been altered to gray . The trend has also seen the newer baseball fields resembling the parks of the early years , as opposed to the cookie-cutter saucer stadiums construcrted throughout the sixties . With salaries now reaching unbelievable highs , no one in the comissioner 's office , and inter-league play on the horizon , it 's nice to see that baseball at least looks like it was meant to be .

Almost a half million new users joined the Internet last year , many of them are commercial businesses . The ban on commercial use of Internet is no more . Jack , there is a difference between using the network for commercial purposes and advertising in newsgroups . Business communication is okay . Advertising to hundreds of thousands of users around the planet who have no desire to receive advertising is not okay . Those of us who pay for Internet access are constrained only by our innate good taste and no have no `` administrator '' to guide ( ? ) us .

If the code was once perfect , and has degraded ever since , we _should_ have some evidence in favour of this statement , should n't we ? Perhaps the biggest `` imperfection '' of the code is that it is full of non-coding regions , introns , which are so called because they intervene with the coding regions ( exons ) . An impressive amount of evidence suggests that introns are of very ancient origin ; it is likely that early exons represented early protein domains . Is the number of introns decreasing or increasing ? It appears that intron loss can occur , and species with common ancestry usually have quite similar exon-intron structure in their genes . On the other hand , the possibility that introns have been inserted later , presents several logical difficulties . Introns are removed by a splicing mechanism - this would have to be present , but unused , if introns are inserted . Moreover , intron insertion would have required _precise_ targeting - random insertion would not be tolerated , since sequences for intron removal ( self-splicing of mRNA ) are conserved . Besides , transposition of a sequence usually leaves a trace - long terminal repeats and target - site duplications , and these are not found in or near intron sequences . I seriously recommend reading textbooks on molecular biology and genetics before posting `` theological arguments '' like this . Try Watson 's Molecular Biology of the Gene or Darnell , Lodish & Baltimore 's Molecular Biology of the Cell for starters . : Remember , the question was posed in a theological context ( Why does : God cause disease in newborns ? ) , and my answer is likewise from a : theological perspective -- my own . It is no less valid than a purely : scientific perspective , just different . Scientific perspective is supported by the evidence , whereas theological perspectives often fail to fulfil this criterion . : I think you misread my meaning . I said God made the genetic code perfect , : but that does n't mean it 's perfect now . It has certainly evolved since . For the worse ? Would you please cite a few references that support your assertion ? Your assertion is less valid than the scientific perspective , unless you support it by some evidence . In fact , it has been claimed that parasites and diseases are perhaps more important than we 've thought - for instance , sex might have evolved as defence against parasites . ( This view is supported by computer simulations of evolution , eg Tierra . ) : Perhaps . I thought it was higher energy rays like X-rays , gamma : rays , and cosmic rays that caused most of the damage . In fact , it is thermal energy that does most of the damage , although it is usually mild and easily fixed by enzymatic action . : Actually , neither of us `` knows '' what the atmosphere was like at the : time when God created life . According to my recollection , most : biologists do not claim that life began 4 billion years ago -- after : all , that would only be a half billion years or so after the earth : was created . It would still be too primitive to support life . I : seem to remember a figure more like 2.5 to 3 billion years ago for : the origination of life on earth . Anyone with a better estimate ? I 'd replace `` created '' with `` formed '' , since there is no need to invoke any creator if the Earth can be formed without one . Most recent estimates of the age of the Earth range between 4.6 - 4.8 billion years , and earliest signs of life ( not true fossils , but organic , stromatolite-like layers ) date back to 3.5 billion years . This would leave more than billion years for the first cells to evolve . I 'm sorry I ca n't give any references , this is based on the course on evolutionary biochemistry I attended here . : > > dominion , it was no great feat for Satan to genetically engineer : > > diseases , both bacterial/viral and genetic .

Again , do you _want_ this be true , or do you have any evidence for this supposed `` degeneration '' ?

I hope you do n't forget this : We have _evidence_ that suggests everything can come about spontaneously . Do you have evidence against this conclusion ? In science , one does not have to _believe_ in anything . It is a healthy sign to doubt and disbelieve . But the right path to walk is to take a look at the evidence if you do so , and not to present one 's own conclusions prior to this . Theology does not use this method . Therefore , I seriously doubt it could ever come to right conclusions . : > > Human DNA , being more `` complex '' , tends to accumulate errors adversely : > > affecting our well-being and ability to fight off disease , while the : > > simpler DNA of bacteria and viruses tend to become more efficient in : > > causing infection and disease . It is a bad combination . Hence : > > we have newborns that suffer from genetic , viral , and bacterial : > > diseases/disorders . You are supposing a purpose , not a valid move . Bacteria and viruses do not exist to cause disease . They are just another manifests of a general principle of evolution - only replication saves replicators from degradiation . We are just an efficient method for our DNA to survive and replicate . The less efficient methods did n't make it to the present . And for the last time . Please present some evidence for your claim that human DNA is degrading through evolutionary processes . Some people have claimed that the opposite is true - we have suppressed our selection , and thus are bound to degrade . I have n't seen much evidence for either claim . : But then I ask , So ? Where is this relevant to my discussion in : answering John 's question of why ? Why are there genetic diseases , : and why are there so many bacterial and viral diseases which require : babies to develop antibodies . Is it God 's fault ? ( the original : question ) -- I say no , it is not . Of course , nothing `` evil '' is god 's fault . But your explanation does not work , it fails miserably . : You may be right . But the fact is that you do n't know that : Satan is not responsible , and neither do I. : : Suppose that a powerful , evil being like Satan exists . Would it : be inconceivable that he might be responsible for many of the ills : that affect mankind ? I do n't think so . He could have done a much better Job . ( Pun intended . ) The problem is , it seems no Satan is necessary to explain any diseases , they are just as inevitable as any product of evolution . : Did I say that ? Where ? Seems to me like another bad inference . : Actually what you 've done is to oversimplify what I said to the : point that your summary of my words takes on a new context . I : never said that people are `` meant '' ( presumably by God ) `` to be : punished by getting diseases '' . Why I did say is that free moral : choices have attendent consequences . If mankind chooses to reject : God , as people have done since the beginning , then they should not : expect God to protect them from adverse events in an entropic : universe . I am not expecting this . If god exists , I expect him to leave us alone . I would also like to hear why do you believe your choices are indeed free . This is an interesting philosophical question , and the answer is not as clear-cut as it seems to be . What consequences would you expect from rejecting Allah ? : Oh , I admit it 's not perfect ( yet ) . But I 'm working on it . : ) A good library or a bookstore is a good starting point . : What does this have to do with the price of tea in China , or the : question to which I provided an answer ? Biology and Genetics are : fine subjects and important scientific endeavors . But they explain : *how* God created and set up life processes . They do n't explain : the why behind creation , life , or its subsequent evolution . Why is there a `` why behind '' ? And your proposition was something that is not supported by the evidence . This is why we recommend these books . Is there any need to invoke any why behind , a prime mover ? Evidence for this ? If the whole universe can come into existence without any intervention , as recent cosmological theories ( Hawking et al ) suggest , why do people still insist on this ? : Thanks Scotty , for your fine and sagely advice . But I am : not highly motivated to learn all the nitty-gritty details : of biology and genetics , although I 'm sure I 'd find it a : fascinating subject .

At issue was not a trial behind closed doors , but arrest , trial and imprisonment in complete secrecy . This was appraently attempted in the case of Vanunu and failed . It has happened before , and there is reason to believe it still goes on . Read this : From Ma'ariv , February 18 ( possibly 28 ) , 1992 PUBLICATION BAN The State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many years there have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were sentenced to long prison terms without either the fact of their arrest or the crimes of which they were accused ever being made public . By Baruch Me'iri All those involved in this matter politely refused my request , one way or another : `` Look , the subject is too delicate . If I comment on it , I will be implicitly admitting that it is true ; If I mention a specific case , even hint at it , I might be guilty of making public something which may legally not be published '' . The State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many years there have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were sentenced to long prison terms without either the fact of their arrest or the crimes of which they were accused ever being made public . More precisely : A court ordered publication ban was placed on the fact of their arrest , and later on their imprisonment . In Israel of 1993 , citizens are imprisoned without us , the citizens of this country , knowing anything about it . Not knowing anything about the fact that one person or another were tried and thrown in prison , for security offenses , in complete secrecy . In the distant past -- for example during the days of the [ Lavon - YA ] affair -- we heard about `` the third man '' being in prison . But many years have passed since then , and what existed then can today no longer be found even in South American countries , or in the former Communist countries . But it appears that this is still possible in Israel of 1993 . The Chair of the Knesset Committee on Law , the Constitution and Justice , MK David Zucker , sent a letter on this subject early this week to the Prime Minister , the Minister of Justice , and the Cabinet Legal Advisor . Ma'ariv has obtained the content of the letter : '' During the past several years a number of Israeli citizens have been imprisoned for various periods for security offenses . In some of these cases a legal publication ban was imposed not only on the specifics of the crimes for which the prisoners were convicted , but even on the mere fact of their imprisonment . In those cases , after being legally convicted , the prisoners spend their term in prison without public awareness either of the imprisonment or of the prisoner '' , asserts MK Zucker . On the other hand Zucker agrees in his letter that , `` There is absolutely no question that it is possible , and in some cases it is imperative , that a publication ban be imposed on the specifics of security offenses and the course of trials . But even in such cases the Court must weigh carefully and deliberately the circumstances under which a trial will not be held in public . `` However , one must ask whether the imposition of a publication ban on the mere fact of a person 's arrest , and on the name of a person sentenced to prison , is justified and appropriate in the State of Israel . The principle of public trial and the right of the public to know are not consistent with the disappearance of a person from public sight and his descent into the abyss of prison . '' Zucker thus decided to turn to the Prime Minister , the Minister of Justice and the Cabinet Legal Advisor and request that they consider the question . `` The State of Israel is strong enough to withstand the cost incurred by abiding by the principle of public punishment . The State of Israel can not be allowed to have prisoners whose detention and its cause is kept secret '' , wrote Zucker . The legal counsel of the Civil Rights Union , Attorney Mordechai Shiffman said that , `` We , as the Civil Rights Union , do not know of any cases of security prisoners , Citizens of Israel , who are imprisoned , and whose imprisonment can not be made public . This is a situation which , if it actually exists , is definitely unhealthy . Just like censorship is an unhealthy matter '' . `` The Union is aware '' , says Shiffman , `` of cases where notification of a suspect 's arrest to family members and lawyers is withheld . I am speaking only of several days . I know also of cases where a detainee was not allowed to meet with an attorney -- sometimes for the whole first month of arrest . That is done because of the great secrecy . `` The suspect himself , his family , his lawyer -- or even a journalist -- can challenge the publication ban in court . But there are cases where the family members themselves are not interested in publicity . The journalist knows nothing of the arrest , and so almost everyone is happy ... '' Attorney Yossi Arnon , an official of the Bar , claims that given the laws as they exist in Israel today , a situation where the arrest of a person for security offenses is kept secret is definitely possible . `` Nothing is easier . The court orders a publication ban , and that's that . Someone who has committed security offenses can spend long years in prison without us knowing anything about it . '' -- Do you find this situation acceptable ? Attorney Arnon : `` Definitely not . We live in a democratic country , and such a state of affairs is impermissible . I am well aware that publication can be damaging -- from the standpoint of security -- but total non-publication , silence , is unacceptable . Consider the trial of Mordechai Vanunu : at least in his case we know that he was charged with aggravated espionage and sentenced to 18 years in prison . The trial was held behind closed doors , nobody knew the details except for those who were authorized to . It is somehow possible to understand , though not to accept , the reasons , but , as I have noted , we at least are aware of his imprisonment . '' -- Why is the matter actually that serious ? Ca n't we trust the discretion of the court ? Attorney Arnon : `` The judges have no choice but to trust the presentations made to them . The judges do not have the tools to investigate . This gives the government enormous power , power which they can misuse . '' -- And what if there really is a security issue ? Attorney Arnon : `` I am a man of the legal system , not a security expert . Democracy stands in opposition to security . I believe it is possible to publicize the matter of the arrest and the charges -- without entering into detail . We have already seen how the laws concerning publication bans can be misused , in the case of the Rachel Heller murder . A suspect in the murder was held for many months without the matter being made public . '' Attorney Shiffman , on the other hand , believes that state security can be a legitimate reason for prohibiting publication of a suspect's arrest , or of a convicted criminal 's imprisonment . `` A healthy situation ? Definitely not . But I am aware of the fact that mere publication may be harmful to state security '' . A different opinion is expressed by attorney Uri Shtendal , former advisor for Arab affairs to Prime Ministers Levi Eshkol and Golda Meir . `` Clearly , we are speaking of isolated special cases . Such situations contrast with the principle that a judicial proceeding must be held in public . No doubt this contradicts the principle of freedom of expression . Definitely also to the principle of individual freedom which is also harmed by the prohibition of publication . `` Nevertheless '' , adds Shtendal , `` the legislator allowed for the possibility of such a ban , to accommodate special cases where the damage possible as a consequence of publication is greater than that which may follow from an abridgment of the principles I 've mentioned . The authority to decide such matters of publication does not rest with the Prime Minister or the security services , but with the court , which we may rest assured will authorize a publication ban only if it has been convinced of its need beyond a shadow of a doubt . '' Nevertheless , attorney Shtendal agrees : `` As a rule , clearly such a phenomenon is undesirable . Such an extreme step must be taken only in the most extreme circumstances .

( Take a few > seconds and honestly ponder that thought and it 's implications ! ! ! ) I have thought about the implications , and it is scary . We have a whole generation of families broken up because some men have decided that is is okay to leave their wives and children for the thrill of a younger , more attractive woman . If we accept that it is legitimate for Jane to have divorced , how can we not accept anyone's decision to divorce because he has found someone with whom he can have a more `` deep , committed relationship . '' Marriage is not a state of being , it is a mutual journey in life . Love is not a passive feeling , it must be actively willed . Is it acceptable for an older executive to dump his wife of many years who stayed home to care for the children because he ca n't be happy sexually unless he is with a beautiful young blonde ? The real solution for both in the couple to make a renewed effort . Hold fast to the faith . Has not the Lord repeatedly compared His relation to His people as a faithful and enduring husband ? We learn something very deep and very mystical when we marry and remain faithful through times of trial . My spouse has a brain tumor that has left her partially paralyzed . If it were to resume growing ( it is in remission , thanks be to God ! ) then perhaps the time would come when we could not have sexual relations . That 's life ... the Lord would certainly not give me permission to seek someone else to satisfy my `` needs . '' The idea that it is alright to divorce if a couple `` grows apart '' seems to me to lead to such a monstrous destruction of the meaning of marriage that I feel we must make every effort to avoid any hint of compromise . We have become so petty and small-minded that some husbands are threatening to divorce their wives unless the wives lose weight ! I praise the Lord for guiding me to marry my wife . She married me anyway despite the possibility that I could have a terrible illness . And it turned out that she was the one with the brain tumor , but had I known I would n't have cared either . And maybe I 'll be in a car accident tomorrow and become paralyzed from the neck down . A married couple should deal with these situations with the help of the Lord , not divorce and run away from them .

The point of formal training must be to prepare riders for the road . Preparedness is in my opinion to know as much as possible . So , to exclude some aspects of riding a bike in a course is wrong IMHO . Now to countersteering in particular . Countersteering is something that must be trained . A common reaction among new bikers ( or bicycle riders ) in an emergency situation , is to steer the motorcycle like a bicycle . As we know this makes the motorcycle go in the direction opposite to what was intended . Needless to say , this is dangerous . I have a specific example : A rider in a left turn . The rider thinks he/she is to close to the right shoulder of the road , and tries to steer the motorcycle to the left by pulling the left handle and pushing the right handle . The motorcycle straightens up and goes off the road . A worse scenario : The same rider , same turn . In the middle of the turn the rider sees a truck coming towards him/her . The panicking rider tries to steer the motorcycle away from the truck and crashes right into it . The main function of a riding course is to teach how to avoid emergency situations , AND what to do if in one . Thus , the knowledge ( and training ) of countersteering is IMHO a must in any riding course . -- staal @ idt.unit.no

The resolution you requested is about 0.3mV In order to get what you 've paid for , noise level better be lower than that . It is kind of hard to do it in a noisy box like you can expect inside a PC . Before you pay $ $ $ for a PC card , test it out by sampling a low distortion sine wave ( I think there is a sine wave on a CD . Digital Domain ? There are possibly other low THD sources ) Run the digitized waveform through a FFT transform and take alook at the noise floor on the spectrum . That 's should give you a good indication of the design . ( That 's what I am doing to test a data acquistion system I have designed - I got the idea from MAXIM data sheet . ) If you can live with 14 bit resolution , I would recommend looking at the MAX121 from MAXIM . It is a high speed ( 308KHz ) complete sampling A/D with DSP interface . The input range is +/- 5V and it uses a serial interface ( which can easily be optically isolated from the computer to elinimate a major noise source ) The Analog design guide I got from them shows a -100db noise level . They claim a -77db max ( -85 typ . ) THD . Looks pretty good for the $ 12 @ 1000 pieces A evaluation kit is available . Might want to give these nice folks a call . 1-800-998-8800 or fax : ( 408 ) 737-7194 and ( 408 ) 737-7600 ext4000 for application assistance .

Even if what you say about this local Pittsburgh guy is true , it is not logical or fair to conclude that this is true of all doctors who treat Lyme disease .

Organization : University Libraries - E & S Library , Carnegie Mellon , Pittsburgh , PA Lines : 19 NNTP-Posting-Host : po4.andrew.cmu.edu After watching the Pengiuns all year ( and as many other teams as possible ) , I 've really noticed an increase in Tom Barasso 's cheap shots this year ( and not noticed a corrsponding increase with other goaltenders ) . I 've also noticed that he usually gets away with it . Just as examples last night , I noticed him elbowing Scott Stevens in the head , which basically started the whole shoving match that got Stevens ( Scott ) and Tocchet 2 minute minors . He also KICKED John McLean . Of course he was n't called for that . Is n't kicking an automatic match penalty and 10 game suspension ? I think Glenn Anderson got one a few years ago for kicking Gaetan Duchesne in the chest . There 's no doubt in my mind that Barasso is the dirtiest golatender since Hextall . He 's also very good . How about that Tocchet head-butt ? Is there an automatic susppension that goes along with a ( non-kicking ) match penalty ? I ca n't remember anymore . Oh , the playoffs should be fun , Ralph

Spectrum Lines : 137 Moscow Scientific Inductrial Association `` Spectrum '' offer VIDEOSCAN vision system for PC/AT , wich include software and set of controllers . SOFTWARE For support VIDEOSCAN family program kit was developed . Kit includes more then 200 different functions for image processing . Kit works in the interactive regime , and has include Help for non professional users . There are next possibility : - input frame by any board of VIDEOSCAN family ; - read - white image to - from disk ; - print image on the printer ; - makes arithmetic with 2 frames ; - filter image ; - work with gistogramme ; - edit image . - include users exe modules . CONTROLLER VS9 The function of VS-9 controller is to load TV-images into PC/AT . VS-9 controller allows one to load a fragment of the TV-frame from a field of 724x600 pixels . The clock rate is 14,7 MHz when loading an image with 512 pixel in the line and 7,4 MHz when loading a 256 pixels image . This provides the equal pixel size of input image in both horizontal and vertical directions . The number of gray levels in any input modes is 256 . Video signal capture time - 2.5s . CONTROLLER VS52 The purpose of the controller is to enter the TV images into a IBM PC AT or any other machine of that type . The controller was created on the base of modern elements , including user programmable gate arrays . The controller allows to digitize a input signal with different resolutions . Its flexible architecture makes possible to change technical parameters . Instead of TV signal one can process any other analog signal ( including signals from slow-speed scanning devices ) . The controller has the following technical characteristics : - memory volume - from 256 K to 2 Mb ; - resolution when working with standard video signal - from 64x64 to 1024x512 pixels ; - resolution when working in slow input regime - up to 2048x1024 pixels ; - video signal capture time - 40 ms. - maximum size of a screen when memory volume is 2Mb - 2048x1024 pixels ; - number of gray level - 256 ; - clock rate for input - up to 30 MHz ; - 4 input video multiplexer ; - input/output lookup table ( LUT ) ; - possibility to realize `` scroll '' and `` zoom '' ; - 8 lines for external synchronization ( an input using external controlling signal ) ; - electronic adjustment of black and white reference for analog - digital converter ; - possibility output image to the color RGB monitor . One can change all listed above functions and parameters of the controller by reprogramming it . IMAGE PROCESSOR VS100 Image processor VS100 allows to digitize and process TV signal in real time . It is possible digitize TV signal with 512*512*8 resolution and realize arithmetic and logic operation with two images . Processor was created on the base of modern elements including user programmable gate arrays and designed as a board for PC . Memory volume allows write to the 256 frames with 512*512*8 format . It is possible to accumulate until 16 images . The processor has the following technical characteristics : - memory volume to 64 Mb ; - number of the gray level - 256 ; - 4 input video multiplexer ; - input/output lookup table ; - electronic adjustment for black and white ADC reference ; - image size from 256*256 to 8192*8192 ; - possibility color and black / white output ; - possibility input from slow-scan video sources .

Of course if this question was asked in a group dealing with economics , the answer would be that the cause of war was economic . My observations over the past 30 years ( and not withstanding a little history reading beside ) is that while religious differences do play a part in many of the conflicts , so does ( unfortunately ) race , economics and any other items that identify one group of men as being different from another . If we want to couch the cause of conflict in Christian terms , I would put it while Christ died for our sins , we are yet sinners . While some individuals assume `` Christlike '' natures , most of us do not even come close . I realize that in many ways this is a trite answer , but I guess that it is my way of rationalizing man 's constant ( or so it seems ) conflict . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Jerry Kemp ( Somtime Consultant ) Internet : kempja @ rcwusr.bp.com kemp_ja @ tnd001.dnet.bp.com

The primary objection ( beyond ones based on the ideal of RKBA that it is simply not something the government should do ) is that it makes guns a play-thing and tool of the rich and connected . It discriminates against the poor . Is self-defense considered appropriate , and if so , under what conditions ? ( Are you allowed , for instance to get a gun for protection if you 're going to be carrying a very large sum of money on a regular basis or have been threatened . ) > The police would check my criminal records for any SERIOUS crimes and/or > records of SERIOUS mental diseases . This has been suggested in the U.S. , and generally supported among gun owners . What many object to is that many , if not most , proposals contain a sort of `` gotcha '' clause which allows an arbitrary denial , even if you qualify in every way . > Now , if a got my licence , I would have to be an active member of the gun > -club for 6 months BEFORE I could collect my gun . > It 's a little like getting a drivers licence is n't it ? ? ? > You have to prove that you CAN drive before you are allowed to ... At this point , it should be pointed out that in general a driver 's licence in the U.S. is for the most part nothing like its European counterpart . I understand getting one is far more difficult there than here . In the U.S. it 's a joke . But my usual objection is that you 're discussing two different things . For instance , in the U.S. a driver 's license is a permit to operate a motor vehicle on a public road . It is not necessary to own one , or to operate it on private property . That is , the ability to require driving permits is generally considered to arise from the government 's legitimate power to enact reasonable regulations for behavior on public lands . A permit to own an automobile , for instance , which is far closer an analogy , would be a much harder thing to get past legally , since it would n't be based on making regulations on public property , but in restricting activity on private property . > Use of guns in crimes ( in Norway ) : > Some crimes are commited with guns that have been in the owners 'arms' > for a long time , but these are rather the exeption . > Most criminals accuire guns to use them in crimes , and mostly short > time befor the crime . > > Use of knives : > It IS allowed to cary knifes in public , but not in your belt or 'open ' . > You ( Americans ) think it 's ok to have a gun , but not to carry it open > in public -rigth ? ? This varies *widely* . ( One thing I think Europeans have a difficult time with is that the U.S. has fifty unique jurisdictions , where the laws from one state to another can be as radically different as from one country in Europe to another ) . Some places allow open carry of both guns and knives . Some allow concealed . Some prohibit both , or allow one or the other . And it can be either a state or local restriciton . > Individual vs masses : > Yes the individual is more important than the masses , but only to some > extent ... . > Your criminal laws are to protect the individuals who makes the masses ? ? > What happens when the rigths of some individuals affects the rights of > all the others ? ? The question must be asked : Is the right of *this* individual affecting the rights of this *other* individual . What we usually get is that the rights of this *group* ( meaning some individuals within this group , here defined as `` people who own guns , '' ) are adversely affecting the rights of some other group . If for instance , `` Bob '' were using his gun to attack `` Steve , '' you'd have a point . But essentially what we 're discussing is that becuase some person who qualifies as a member of the group `` people who own guns '' then some third person , perhaps in another *time zone* is told that their being a member of that group is taking away somebody else's rights . It 's like trying to punish all newspapers for the libel commited by one . > The issue : > I believe the issue is GUNS , and gun-legislation . The issue is crime , violence , and murder . The question is to what extent guns and gun legislation impact those . > We should n't mix weapons and items that can serve as one ... . > IF i lived in Amerika I would probably have a gun to defend myselfe in HOME . > But should it have to be like that ? ? Of course not . It would be nice if we did n't have to fear that other people might get it into their twisted little minds to hurt us . But currently we do n't have that option . Nor do I expect we will . > Do you think it 's wise to sell guns like candy ( some states do ... ) ? ? No state does . In any case , there 's a limit to which the state may enforce it 's `` wisdom '' on me . Freedom in general is an unwise concept . If you pre-emptively restrict everything which might be '' unwise '' then freedom becomes a meaningless concept . > If you believe it 's smart/neccacery to have drivers-licence WHY do you think > it should be free to buy guns ? ? I 'll raise my hand against driver 's licenses . As currently implemented they 're a waste of time and little more than revanue generation for the State and ignored by a startling number of drivers . It does not guarantee a level of skill any higher than is necessary to get your car on the road and get yourself or somebody else killed , or a knowledge of traffic laws beyond what any ten year old will have picked up riding around in his parents car .

Research & Development , Schenectady , NY Lines : 21 I have noticed in FrameMaker 3.1X on both the SGI and SUN platforms that certain dialogs , such as `` Column Layout ... '' for example , respond to keyboard traversal even though the pointer is NOT in the dialog window and even though the window manager keyboard focus policy is POINTER . How is this done ? I would like to emulate this behavior in my application . It seems a reasonable behavior since when a dialog is popped up from a keyboard action , the dialog is not guaranteed to be under the pointer and the user should not have to reach for the mouse just to move the focus . Alternatively , I 'm open to any suggestions as to what is the `` right '' way to insure that popups get the focus when they appear , particularly when they are invoked from the keyboard and one 's keyboard focus policy is pointer .

Of course B.M . is not incorrect . He is defending Islam . When defending Islam against infidels you can say anything and no one will dare criticize you . But when an atheist uses the same argument he is using `` petty sarcasm '' .

From : accgsg @ vaxa.hofstra.edu ( Gary Graffagnino ) Subject : Isles / Hockey Ramblings Lines : 43 Well , the Patrick Division got a little more interesting last night . The Islanders lost in OT and the Devils tied the Pens . That means if the Isles beat the Devils on Friday , the will meet the Caps in the playoffs . However , I have some more comments on the Islanders and hockey in general that I need to get off my chest : ) . First of all , with the Islanders back-to-back lackluster performances against the Whalers , one may think that the Islanders are out of shape . These guys always suck wind in the 2nd period , come on a little in the 3rd and run out of gas too soon . It is unbelieveable how many one goal games these guys have lost . Anyway , the games was pretty wide open . The Isles still have tons of trouble scoring . The Whalers played a golie in is 1st NHL start , I think his name was Lenarduzzi ( sp ? ) . ( His NHL debut was the Tuesday tie against the Isles ) . Like I mentioned before , this guy looked like the best golie on the planet for a while ( until he misplayed a Mahlakov slap shot to go to OT ) . I say it 's because the Isles do n't shoot correctly . Has anyone else noticed this ? Also , I think it is really a shame for hockey when I guy like Mick Vukota gets as much ice time as he does . This guy has about as much hockey talent as Jiggs MacDonald ( who did play hockey , I think ) . Anytime he gets the puck it gets stolen , and he always starts fights and gets needless penalties . Richard Pilon is another guy who is on the ice to stir up crap . And he 's a defenseman . He 's got to be approaching negative infinity for his plus/minus . This guy gets beaten all the time . Why the need for such `` enforcers '' ? Not only do fights slow the game down ALOT , but it takes away from the guys who are really trying to play the game . I 'll be one of the few to admit , I do enjoy a good fight once in a while , but only when it 's `` called for '' . You know , when a guy checks the goalie too hard . In other words , a violation of `` hockey ethics '' might cause you to get puched . But there is no need to start crap when you are losing or becuase you can get away with it ! ! Does anyone agree that referees need to be a little less lenient in the 3rd and OT ? I mean COME ON already . I 'm sick of seeing teams pulling guys down , holding guys etc . just becuase the referee does n't call it . OT and late in the 3rd should be a time for strategy , not physical prowess . Trying to set up a goal should be first and foremost . If you are so afraid that the other team is going to score that you have to pull a guy down to prevent it , you do n't deserve to win in the first place .

Atoms are not objective . They are n't even real . What scientists call an atom is nothing more than a mathematical model that describes certain physical , observable properties of our surroundings . All of which is subjective . What is objective , though , is the approach a scientist takes in discussing his model and his observations . There is no objective science . But there is an objective approach which is subjectively selected by the scientist . Objective in this case means a specified , unchanging set of rules that he and his colleagues use to discuss their science . This is in contrast to your Objective Morality . There may be an objective approach to subjectively discuss your beliefs on morality . But there exists no objective morality . Also , science deals with how we can discuss our observations of the physical world around us . In that the method of discussion is objective ( not the science ; not the discussion itself ) . Science makes no claims to know the whys or even the hows sometimes of what we can observe . It simply gives us a way to discuss our surroundings in a meaningful , consistent way .

I > think if you wish to change this you would have to be a pirate , and we 're not > going to promote that here . No , we 're not . But we 're also not going to promote pandering to corporate paranoia when the real issue is convenience . I do n't *like* dealing with floppies . Personally , I have no use for changing the registration info , but I see it as a valid need , and one that ought to be solved using a quick little utility rather than a half-hour reinstall that 's just about guaranteed to mess up your settings in one way or another . So , while I 'm not going to put much time into it myself , here 's the procedure for getting on your way to finding the encoded information : 1 . Copy all your Windows disks into the directory from which you want to install it . I 've been using c : \WINSTALL myself . 2 . From there , copy that directory to something like c : \WINORIG . 3 . Install from c : \winstall . 4. comp the two directories to determine changes . i.e. , comp * . * \winorig\* . * > \report.txt 5 . Look in the report file for the file ( s ) that change . Assuming they did n't cover themselves covering their own tracks , at least one file should have a difference noted at a particular offset . Locate said offset in the original directory and see what 's there using a hex editor , and do the same for the modified one . 6 . You 're on your own as far as breaking the code goes ; I don't really do cryptography . It 's probably just an xor key or something ; I think MS is more concerned with Joe Schmoe at the office personalizing his copy than with `` real pirates '' who will probably just disassemble the damned thing anyway . This technique should work with just about any obnoxious corporate product that tries to write to the original floppies when you install ; in some extreme cases you may not be able to back the floppies up to hard disk , and will be stuck doing a compare on floppies ( Lotus stuff is probably like that ) . As I noted before , if you can afford the space on the hard disk , and do n't do much in the way of customization , reinstalling from one directory to another may be less arduous . Doing some of the stuff I 've mentioned here may well void your license with Microsoft , as if they 'd ever find out . If you are n't careful with the disk editor , you could also mung something important ... duh . I guess that 's a disclaimer . Have at it ... .

If we 're talking ISA ( AT ) bus here , then you can only have 1 DMA channel active at any one time , presumably transferring data from a single device . So even though you can have at least 7 devices on a SCSI bus , explain how all 7 of those devices can to DMA transfers through a single SCSI card to the ISA-AT bus at the same time . Also , I 'm still trying to track down a copy of IBM 's AT reference book , but from their PC technical manual ( page 2-93 ) : '' The ( FDD ) adapter is buffered on the I.O bus and uses the System Board direct memory access ( DMA ) for record data transfers . '' I expect to see something similar for the PC-AT HDD adapter . So the lowly low-density original PC FDD card used DMA and the PC-AT HDD controller does n't ! ? ! ? That makes real sense .

To incrementally update the contents of windows , I use the following trick : 1 . Set the window background to None , 2 . Call XClearArea ( display , window , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , True ) , 3 . Restore the window background to its correct value . The call to XClearArea does not repaint the window background , but still generates exposure events for visible parts of the window . In order to let my application know that these expose events must be handled incrementally ( something is already displayed on the screen and may need to be erased ) , I encapsulate the 3 operations with 2 self addressed client messages , which preserve asynchronicity between the client and the server . XGrabServer ( display ) client message ( start-incremental ) background None XClearArea Restore background client message ( end-incremental ) XUngrabServer ( display ) The GrabServer prevents other events to be inserted by the server in the critical section . -- - Vincent Prunet , Sema Group Sophia Antipolis INRIA BP 93 06902 SOPHIA ANTIPOLIS Cedex FRANCE prunet @ sophia.inria.fr , ( 33 ) 93 65 78 42 , Fax : ( 33 ) 93 65 77 66

The suffering that they are Let us not forget about the genocide of the Azeri people in 'Karabag ' and x-Soviet Armenia by the Armenians . Between 1914 and 1920 , Armenians committed unheard-of crimes , resorted to all conceivable methods of despotism , organized massacres , poured petrol over babies and burned them , raped women and girls in front of their parents who were bound hand and foot , took girls from their mothers and fathers and appropriated personal property and real estate . And today , they put Azeris in the most unbearable conditions any other nation had ever known in history . AREF SADIKOV sat quietly in the shade of a cafe-bar on the Caspian Sea esplanade of Baku and showed a line of stitches in his trousers , torn by an Armenian bullet as he fled the town of Hojali just over three months ago , writes Hugh Pope . `` I 'm still wearing the same clothes , I do n't have any others , '' the 51-year-old carpenter said , beginning his account of the Hojali disaster . `` I was wounded in five places , but I am lucky to be alive . '' Mr Sadikov and his wife were short of food , without electricity for more than a month , and cut off from helicopter flights for 12 days . They sensed the Armenian noose was tightening around the 2,000 to 3,000 people left in the straggling Azeri town on the edge of Karabakh . `` At about 11pm a bombardment started such as we had never heard before , eight or nine kinds of weapons , artillery , heavy machine-guns , the lot , '' Mr Sadikov said . Soon neighbours were pouring down the street from the direction of the attack . Some huddled in shelters but others started fleeing the town , down a hill , through a stream and through the snow into a forest on the other side . To escape , the townspeople had to reach the Azeri town of Agdam about 15 miles away . They thought they were going to make it , until at about dawn they reached a bottleneck between the two Armenian villages of Nakhchivanik and Saderak . `` None of my group was hurt up to then ... Then we were spotted by a car on the road , and the Armenian outposts started opening fire , '' Mr Sadikov said . Azeri militiamen fighting their way out of Hojali rushed forward to force open a corridor for the civilians , but their efforts were mostly in vain . Mr Sadikov said only 10 people from his group of 80 made it through , including his wife and militiaman son . Seven of his immediate relations died , including his 67-year-old elder brother . `` I only had time to reach down and cover his face with his hat , '' he said , pulling his own big flat Turkish cap over his eyes . `` We have never got any of the bodies back . '' The first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire . One hero of the evacuation , Alif Hajief , was shot dead as he struggled to change a magazine while covering the third group's crossing , Mr Sadikov said . Another hero , Elman Memmedov , the mayor of Hojali , said he and several others spent the whole day of 26 February in the bushy hillside , surrounded by dead bodies as they tried to keep three Armenian armoured personnel carriers at bay . As the survivors staggered the last mile into Agdam , there was little comfort in a town from which most of the population was soon to flee . `` The night after we reached the town there was a big Armenian rocket attack . Some people just kept going , '' Mr Sadikov said . `` I had to get to the hospital for treatment . I was in a bad way . They even found a bullet in my sock . '' Victims of war : An Azeri woman mourns her son , killed in the Hojali massacre in February ( left ) . Nurses struggle in primitive conditions ( centre ) to save a wounded man in a makeshift operating theatre set up in a train carriage . Grief-stricken relatives in the town of Agdam ( right ) weep over the coffin of another of the massacre victims .

Is there any ftp sites that has SyQuest driver or cd-rom driver for the PC if I can have everything hooked up OK ? 4 ) What I want is a 486 motherboard , a sound board to make it a MPC- quality station . How much would it cost to do that ? Is it worth the hussle than just buy a new 486 station ? BTW , I need to buy a keyboard for it too . Any input is welcome . Thank you . Peter Liu

The original one-way encryption I put into Multics about 1968 ( as suggested by Joe Weizenbaum ) was invertible . An Air Force tiger team demonstrated this to me in May 1973 . I then asked an expert ( who requested anonymity ) what I should use instead ; the expert 's suggestion was to treat the 8-byte password as both key and data for the LUCIFER encryption algorithm , which is similar or identical to DES . This method or something stronger should take care of ( a ) .

Getting rid of the keys is actually pretty easy to do automatically on a communications link , as opposed to storage where the keys have to be retained somehow as long as the owner wants to be able to retrieve the data . The right way to do communications security is to generate a random session key with Diffie Hellman , use it for a while and then destroy it . Once it 's gone , there 's no getting it back , and no way to decrypt recordings of the conversation . To make sure you are n't being attacked by a man in the middle , you have to authenticate your DH exchanges . The AT & T secure phone does this by displaying the DH key so you can compare them verbally over the phone . This is nice and simple , but it relies on user awareness plus the inability of the man in the middle to duplicate the users' voices . A better way is to authenticate the exchanges with RSA . Since you'd never use RSA for actual encryption , compromising your RSA secret key would only allow someone to impersonate you in a future conversation , and even that only until you revoke your public key . They would still not be able to decrypt recordings of prior conversations for which the session keys have been destroyed . I 'm convinced that this is how the government 's own secure phones ( the STU-III ) must work . Neat , eh ? Phil

From : gtoal @ gtoal.com ( Graham Toal ) Subject : Re : Is key escrow enough ? Lines : 24 The points raised about checking what is actually -in- the chip , as opposed to what is allegedly programmed therein , raise yet another trust issue . Even if we assume that these `` trusted agents '' are really entering a wide range of S1 and S2 seeds ( rather than using the same one all the time to reduce the key search space to 30 bits ) , I assume they are not doing so by picking up an iron filing and poking it into the circuitry at carefully selected points to encode data . They would presumably be punching numbers into a computer , which for all they know could program the chips in a manner completely independent of the S1 and S2 values they are feeding into the system . S1 and S2 are clearly the backdoor - we should assume they are all compromised . If they 're not compromisable , why the hell not use a hardware true random number source . There is n't a random number source *anywhere* in this proposal . The whole thing is deterministic from the day the serial number is stamped on the chip . Nope , it ca n't be trusted . This is all about two levels of access - the ( possibly honest ) key escrow that police forces have to use , and ostensibly the FBI ; and the back door that lets the NSA decode *everything* on the fly - and maybe some back-handers to the FBI when they want a warrantless tab in exchange for favours .

'' As you can see from file geodeA.gif , it uses a Space Shuttle External Tank ( ET ) in place of much of the truss which is currently part of Space Station Freedom . The white track on the outside of the ET is used by the Station Remonte Manipulator System ( SRMS ) and by the Reaction Control System ( RCS ) pod . This allows the RCS pod to move along the track so that thrusting can occur near the center of gravity ( CG ) of the Station as the mass properties of the Station change during assembly . The inline module design allows the Shuttle to dock more easily because it can approach closer to the Station 's CG and at a structurally strong part of the Station . In the current SSF design , docking forces are limited to 400 pounds , which seriously constrains the design of the docking system . The ET would have a hatch installed pre-flight , with little additional launch mass . We 've always had the ability to put an ET into orbit ( contrary to some rumors which have circulated here ) , but we 've never had a reason to do it , while we have had some good reasons not to ( performance penalties , control , debris generation , and eventual de-orbit and impact footprint ) . Once on-orbit , we would vent the residual H2 . The ET insulation ( SOFI ) either a ) erodes on-orbit from impact with atomic Oxygen , or b ) stays where it is , and we deploy a Kevlar sheath around it to protect it and keep it from contaminating the local space environment . Option b ) has the advantage of providing further micrometeor protection . The ET is incredibly strong ( remember , it supports the whole stack during launch ) , and could serve as the nucleus for a much more ambitious design as budget permits . The white module at the end of ET contains a set of Control Moment Gyros to be used for attitude control , while the RCS will be used for gyro desaturation . The module also contains a de-orbit system which can be used at the end of the Station 's life to perform a controlled de-orbit ( so we do n't kill any more kangaroos , like we did with Skylab ) . The centrifuge , which has the same volume as a hab module , could be used for long-term studies of the effects of lunar or martian gravity on humans . The centrifuge will be used as a momentum storage device for the whole attitude control system . The centrifuge is mounted on one of the modules , opposite the ET and the solar panels . This design uses most of the existing SSF designs for electrical , data and communication systems , getting leverage from the SSF work done to date . Mark proposed this design at Joe Shea 's committee in Crystal City , and he reports that he was warmly received . However , the rumors I hear say that a design based on a wingless Space Shuttle Orbiter seems more likely . Please note that this text is my interpretation of Mark 's design ; you should see his notes in the GIF files . Instead of posting a 2 MB file to sci.space , I tried to post these for anon-FTP in ames.arc.nasa.gov , but it was out of storage space . I'll let you all know when I get that done . -- Ken Jenks , NASA/JSC/GM2 , Space Shuttle Program Office kjenks @ gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov ( 713 ) 483-4368 `` ...

There are , but not any that would help Texans : In many states , such laws have been found to violate the state constitution . But the federal Second Amendment does not apply directly to the states . It was written to limit the federal government only . The Fourteenth Amendment was written to extend the restrictions of the Bill of Rights to the state level . However , the exact wording of the Fourteenth Amendment is very vague . The Supreme Court has been dancing around the issue without facing it directly for over 100 years . In practice , the Bill of Right ( indirectly applies through the Fourteenth ) applies to the state governments only if the Supreme Court has ruled that particular provision . The Court has made no such rulings on the Second Amendment . Frank Crary CU Boulder

I do n't understand what you are getting at here . If the chances of promiscuity are larger , yet the rate of promiscuity is lower in the heterosexual community , does n't that imply that the homo/bi sexual population is then even more promiscuous than the raw statistics imply ?

Sadly , we do n't ( as a society ) look upon homosexuality as normal ( and as we are all too well aware , there are alot of people who condemn it ) . As a result , the gay population is not encouraged to develop `` non-promiscuous '' relationships . In fact there are many roadblocks put in the way of such committed relationships . It is as if the heterosexual community puts these blocks there so as to perpetuate the claim that gays are immoral . `` My , if we allowed gays to marry , raise children ... we might just find out they 're as moral as we are , ca n't have that can we ?

Here 's how I understand it . Remember from stellar evolution that black holes and neutron stars ( pulsars ) are formed from high mass stars , M ( star ) =1.4M ( sun ) . High mass stars live fast and burn hard , taking appoximately 10^5-10^7 years before going nova , or supernova . In this time , they do n't live long enough to get perturbed out of the galactic plane , so any of these ( if assumed to be the sources of GRB 's ) will be in the plane of the galaxy . Then we take the catalog of bursts that have been recieved from the various satellites around the solar system , ( Pioneer Venus has one , either Pion . 10 or 11 , GINGA , and of course BATSE ) and we do distribution tests on our catalog . These tests all show , that the bursts have an isotropic distribution ( evenly spread out in a radial direction ) , and they show signs of homogeneity , i.e . they do not clump in any one direction . So , unless we are sampling the area inside the disk of the galaxy , we are sampling the UNIVERSE . Not cool , if you want to figure out what the hell caused these things . Now , I suppose you are saying , `` Well , we stil only may be sampling from inside the disk . '' Well , not necessarily . Remember , we have what is more or less an interplanetary network of burst detectors with a baseline that goes waaaay out to beyond Pluto ( pioneer 11 ) , so we should be able , with all of our detectors de tect some sort of difference in angle from satellite to satellite . Here 's an analogy : You see a plane overhead . You measure the angle of the plane from the origin of your arbitrary coordinate system . One of your friends a mile away sees the same plane , and measures the angle from the zero point of his arbitrary system , which is the same as yours . The two angles are different , and you should be able to triangulate the position of your burst , and maybe find a source . To my knowledge , no one has been able to do this . I should throw in why halo , and corona models do n't work , also . As I said before , looking at the possible astrophysics of the bursts , ( short timescales , high energy ) black holes , and pulsars exhibit much of this type of behavior . If this is the case , as I said before , these stars seem to be bound to the disk of the galaxy , especially the most energetic of the these sources . When you look at a simulated model , where the bursts are confined to the disk , but you sample out to large distances , say 750 mpc , you should definitely see not only an anisotropy towards you in all direction , but a clumping of sources in the direction of the galactic center . As I said before , there is none of these characteristics . I think that 's all of it ... if someone needs clarification , or knows something that I do n't know , by all means correct me . I had the honor of taking the Bursts class with the person who has done the modeling of these different distributions , so we pretty much kicked around every possible distribution there was , and some VERY outrageous sources . Colliding pulsars , black holes , pulsars that are slowing down ... stuff like that . It 's a fun field . Complaints and corrections to : belgarath @ vax1.mankato.msus.edu or post here . -jeremy

It does depend on how ambitious you are and how concerned you are about compliance with the general interface and items like traversal . One widget is a multi-column list ( which lots of people have already written , I am sure ) , and would therefore be probably be a subclass of List rather than something simple like an Xt class . Is this more difficult ( in principle , not lines of code ) ? I 'm not sure what you 're asking . You could create something which is very much like a true multi-column list by placing several lists within a geometry manager , and putting that manager within an automatic scrolled window . This wouldn't be good for very large lists , but you might consider this as an alternative . Alternatively , if anyone has a multi-column list widget they could sell me , this might save me from having to write one ! Does it by any chance exist in Motif 1.2 already ( I do not yet have the spec ) ? Motif 1.2 does not have a multi-column list in it . Have you looked at commercial sets ?

Thus while I believe that no gods exist , this does ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ > not imply *faith* on my part that it is so . ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Let me first say that `` to believe that no gods exist '' is in fact different than `` not believing in a god or gods '' . I will argue that your latter statement , `` I believe that no gods exist '' does rest upon faith - that is , if you are making a POSITIVE statement that `` no gods exist '' ( strong atheism ) rather than merely saying I do n't know and therefore do n't believe in them and do n't NOT believe in then ( weak atheism ) . Once again , to not believe in God is different than saying I BELIEVE that God does not exist . I still maintain the position , even after reading the FAQs , that strong atheism requires faith . But first let me say the following . We might have a language problem here - in regards to `` faith '' and '' existence '' . I , as a Christian , maintain that God does not exist . To exist means to have being in space and time . God does not HAVE being - God IS Being . Kierkegaard once said that God does not exist , He is eternal . With this said , I feel it 's rather pointless to debate the so called `` existence '' of God - and that is not what I 'm doing here . I believe that God is the source and ground of being . When you say that `` god does not exist '' , I also accept this statement - but we obviously mean two different things by it . However , in what follows I will use the phrase `` the existence of God '' in it's 'usual sense ' - and this is the sense that I think you are using it . I would like a clarification upon what you mean by `` the existence of God '' . We also might differ upon what it means to have faith . Here is what Webster says : faith 1a : allegiance to duty or a person : LOYALTY b ( 1 ) : fidelity to one 's promises ( 2 ) : sincerity of intentions 2a ( 1 ) : belief and trust in and loyalty to God ( 2 ) : belief in the traditional doctrines of a religion b ( 1 ) : firm belief in something for which there is no proof ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ( 2 ) : complete trust 3 : something that is believed esp . with strong conviction ; esp : a system ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ of religious beliefs syn see BELIEF One can never prove that God does or does not exist . When you say that you believe God does not exist , and that this is an opinion '' based upon observation '' , I will have to ask `` what observtions are you refering to ? '' There are NO observations - pro or con - that are valid here in establishing a POSITIVE belief . All observations can only point you in a direction - a direction that we might even be predisposed to ( by predisposed I mean , for example , people whoes partents `` believe in God '' also tend to ) . To actually draw a conclusion about the `` existence '' or `` non-existence '' of God requires a leap - and you have made this leap when you actively say `` I believe that God does/does not exist '' . Personally , I think that both statements are misguided . Arguing over the `` existence '' of God is precisely the wrong way to find Him ( and yes , I use `` Him '' because a personal God is the only viable concept ( IMO ) - if a person wants to use `` She '' go ahead . Of course God is neither He nor She - but we have no choice but to anthropomorphise . If you want me to explain myself further I 'll be glad to . ) And please , if someone does not agree with me - even if they violently disagree - it 's in no ones advantage to start name calling . If a person thinks I 've misunderstood something in the FAQs , or if they they think I have not read them well enough , just point out to me the error of my ways and I correct the situation . I 'm interested in a polite and well thought out discussion . > Cheers > > Simon > -- > Simon Clippingdale simon @ dcs.warwick.ac.uk > Department of Computer Science Tel ( +44 ) 203 523296 > University of Warwick FAX ( +44 ) 203 525714 > Coventry CV4 7AL , U.K. -- bob singleton bobs @ thnext.mit.edu

Her opthamologist calls it peripheral retinal hemorhages and says it looks similar to diabetic retinopathy . ( She is n't diabetic -- they checked . 6. distorted color vision and distorted vision in general ( telephone poles do not appear to be straight ) 7. loss of peripheral vision . Many tests have been run and all are normal except for something called unidentified bright objects found on a MRI of her brain . The only thing that seems to alleviate one of these episodes is prednisone . At times she had been on 60 mg per day . Whenever she gets down to 10-15 mg the symptoms become acute again . She is quite concerned because the retinal hemorrhages are becoming worse with each episode and her vision is suffering . None of the docs she has seen have any idea what this condition is or what can be done to stop it . Any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated . Thanks in advance . Kathy Turner

On examining the power board , I noticed the largest capacitor with a very bad bulge at the top . Naturally , I want to replace it , but I ca n't find any sources . The electrolytic capacitor is 330 mF at 250WV . It has radial leads , and is roughly 1 1/2 inches long , 1 1/8 '' wide . The dimensions are important since the whole board fits in a metal cage , leaving little room .

Can anyone suggest sources for high-voltage capacitors ? Mail order is fine , although I 'd rather check out a store to compare the can .

Women Athletes , TLP Win Sex Discrimination Ruling : Brown University Ordered to Restore Two Women 's Varsity Teams To : National Desk , Sports Writer Contact : Lynette Labinger , 401-421-9794 , home 401-274-7507 , or Ray Marcaccio , 401-831-8900 , both of Trial Lawyers For Public Justice WASHINGTON , April 16 -- The U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in Boston has upheld a U.S. District Court order requiring Brown University to immediately reinstate its women's gymnastics and volleyball teams to full varsity status . The ruling in Cohen et al . v. Brown University is the first appeals court decision in the nation applying Title IX to intercollegiate athletics . Trial Lawyers for Public Justice ( TLPJ ) , is the national public interest law firm representing the women athletes . `` This ruling makes clear what we have said all along -- if a school wants to eliminate teams before women have their fair share of opportunities to participate , they can only eliminiate men 's teams , '' said TLPJ Executive Director Arthur Bryant , co-counsel in the case . The class action , filed April , 1992 , charged Brown with violating Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 , the federal law that prohibits sex discrimination by all educational institutions receiving federal funds . Brown terminated the two women 's teams as university-funded sports in May 1991 , allowing them to continue to compete against varsity teams if they could raise their own funds for uniforms , travel , coaches , and all other expenses . They had also been denied admission preferences for use in recruiting new members . `` This is a major victory for women and the cause of equal rights , '' said TLPJ lead counsel Lynette Labinger of Providence 's Roney & Labinger . `` Universities across America need to reevaluate their programs quickly . Title IX is the law and it 's going to be enforced . '' Three similar Title IX appeals await decision . Colorado State University , Indiana University of Pennsylvania ( IUP ) , and Colgate University are asking federal appeals courts to overturn court orders requiring them to reinstate or establish specific women 's varsity teams . Continuing its cutting-edge Title IX activities , TLPJ is representing women athletes at IUP . In addition to Labinger and Bryant , TLPJ 's legal team included : Ray Marcaccio of Blish & Cavanagh and Amato DeLuca of Mandell , DeLuca & Schwartz in Providence ; and Sandra Duggan of Philadelphia . The National Women 's Law Center , Women 's Sports Foundation , and National Association for Girls and Women in Sports filed an amicus brief in support of TLPJ 's appeal . -30-

If you need speed , and your client can run on the same host as the X server , you should use the shared memory extension to the sample X server ( MIT-SHM ) . xdpyinfo will tell you if your server has this extension . This is certainly available with the sample MIT X server running under SunOS . A word of warning : make sure your kernel is configured to support shared memory . And another word of warning : OpenWindows is slower than the MIT server . I have written an imaging tool ( using XView for the GUI , by the way ) which yields over 10 frames per second for 512*512*8 bit images , running on a Sparc IPC ( half the cpu grunt of an IPX ) . This has proved quite sufficient for animations . Regards , Richard Gooch ... .

TORTURE . /* Written 4:41 pm Apr 16 , 1993 by cpr @ igc.apc.org in igc : mideast.forum */ /* -- -- -- -- -- `` From Israeli press . TORTURE . '' -- -- -- -- -- */ FROM THE ISRAELI PRESS . Newspaper : Ma'ariv Date : 18 . December 1992 Author : Avi Raz Subject : Torture Title of article : Moderate physical pressure Several times in the course of the long hours in the interrogation room in Tulkarm prison , during which he says he was humiliated , beaten and tortured , Omar Daoud Jaber heard his interrogator , a Shabak agent 'Captain Louis ' , chatting on the phone with his wife . `` At those moments '' , Omar said , `` I felt that he was like a humanbeing , but right after he finished talking , he would be beat me and say , 'You listened to the conversation and enjoyed yourself ' and I understood that he was not really a human being '' . In late October 1992 , after 38 days in detention at Tulkarm prison , Omar Jaber was released without charges . `` Among the Jews , as among the Arabs , there are good people and bad people '' , he said after his release , `` but there , in Tulkarm , in the interrogations rooms , you can not find even one person about whom you can say that he is a human being '' . Although he left the detention installation in Tulkarm bruised and humiliated ( `` I sat at home for ten days . My hands shook from nerves '' ) , one may consider Omar Jaber lucky : He got out , not so healthy , but entire , and even ultimately returned to normal functioning , at the small solar heater plant he owns . In contrast , Hassan Bader al-Zbeidi , for example , was released seven weeks ago from detention in Tulkarm after 33 days in the Shabak wing , cut off from his surroundings . He does n't speak or react . Mustafa Barakat , aged only 23 , who was arrested in early August and was brought to the Tulkarm detention installation , left it one day later - dead . `` We have recently received an especially large number of testimonies concerning cruel tortures employed at the Tulkarm detention installation by Shabak interrogators '' , noted Dr. Niv Gordon , director of the Association of Israel and Palestinian Physicians for Human Rights . ( ... ) The right to complain against the Shabak does not excite Anan Saber Makhlouf , a 20 year old student . In fact , he was extremely fearful about describing the manner in which he was interrogated in Tulkarm prison , in case the publication in the paper would return him to detention and lead to renewed mistreatment . ( ... follow description of tortures ... . ) Omar , a tall bearded man , was silent . `` I do not want to talk about it '' , he finally said , quietly . Some time later , embarrased and ashamed , he spoke : `` Sometimes he beats you and beats you until you 'll kiss his hand , and not only his hand . Even the hands of another interrogator , and another , whom he calls into the room , and the last interrogator says : '' Now you are kissing my hand , and later if I want , you will kiss my ass . '' These things take place in an Israeli army detention installation , located within the military government compound in Tulkarm ( West Bank ) . But the Shabak interrogation wing is a separate kingdom . In early March the IDF allowed representatives of B'Tselem , the Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Territories , to visit Tulkarm prison , but denied them access to the interrogation wing . `` The interrogation wing is Shabak property , being solely under Shabak responsibility . All interrogations are performed by it '' , said Lieutnant Sharon Sho'an , the commander of the installation , according to the internal report written by B'tselem member , Yuval Ginbar , following the visit . Major David Pe'er , governing commander of the prison system in the Central Command , was quoted in the report : `` There is an ethical problem here - no one can enter the interrogation wing '' .

From : drt @ athena.mit.edu ( David R Tucker ) Subject : Re : Question : Jesus alone , Oneness Organization : Massachusetts Institute of Technology Lines : 89 Regarding `` Jesus only '' believers , our moderator writes : [ There may be some misunderstanding over terms here ... ] I agree . Quite likely , actually . [ ... I believe `` Jesus only '' originally was in the context of baptism . These are folks who believe that baptism should be done with a formula mentioning only Jesus , rather than Father , Son , and Holy Spirit . This may have doctrinal implications , but as far as I know it does not mean that these folks deny the existence or divinity of the Father . I 'm not the right one to describe this theology , and in fact I think there may be several , including what would classically be called monophysite or Arian ( two rather different views ) , as well as some who have beliefs that are probably consistent with Trinitarian standards , but who won't use Trinitarian language because they misunderstand it or simply because it is not Biblical . -- clh ] Not Biblical ? What then can they make of the end of Matthew ? ( 28:18 ) And Jesus came and said to them , `` All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me . ( 19 ) Go therefore and make disciples of all nations , baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit , ( 20 ) and teaching them to obey everything that I have commanded to you . And remember , I am with you always , to the end of the age . '' { Other ancient authorities add *Amen* } [ NRSV ] The notes give no sense that this is emended . Do other texts contradict this regarding Baptism ? Or is a misunderstanding of the Trinity the most likely explanation after all ? But maybe I simply misunderstand their views . ( Is anyone else out there forced to read this group with both a good Bible and an unabridged dictionary ? ? Christianity really is an education in itself . ) -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- |David R. Tucker KG2S drt @ athena.mit.edu| -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- [ Arrgggghhhh . When I talked about people who rejected Trinitarian language as unBiblical , I was speaking of Trinitarian theology , things like `` one essense and three persons '' . Obviously the three-fold baptismal formula is Biblical , as you point out . ( I normally use the term `` three-fold '' in referring to Mat . While it is certainly consistent with belief in the Trinity , the Trinity is a doctrine whose full formulation occurred in the 4th and 5th Cent 's . It 's unlikely that Mat . had in mind the fully-developed Trinitarian doctrine . Indeed the three-fold baptismal formula is used by some groups that do not believe in the Trinity . ) The disagreement over baptismal formulae occurs because of passages such as Acts 2:38 , which command baptism in the name of Jesus . ( There are a couple of other passages in Acts as well . ) This leaves us with sort of a problem : we 're commanded in Mat . to baptize in the name of the Father , the Son , and the Holy Spirit , and in Acts to baptize in the name of Jesus . `` Jesus only '' groups baptize in the name of Jesus . They consider this consistent with Mat 28:18 , because they say that Jesus is the name of the Father , the Son , and the Holy Spirit . I 'm not the right one to ask to explain what this means . I will simply say that it does not appear to be normal Trinitarian theology . ( It is also an odd way of dealing with the idiomatic phrase `` in the name of '' . ) Those who use the three-fold formula do n't seem to have a standard answer to the passages talking about baptizing in the name of Jesus . I suspect that the most common explanation is to say that `` in the name of '' need not be a verbal formula . To say that you baptize in the name of Jesus may simply mean that you are doing baptism under Jesus' authority . In the 1st Cent . context , it contrasts Christian baptism with the baptism of John or other Jewish baptism . Of course there 's a certain parallelism between these passages . That suggests that we could just as well say that Mat 28:18 does n't require the specific three-fold formula to be used in baptism , but simply characterizes baptism done by those who follow the Father , Son , and Holy Spirit . One might well suspect that in the early church , more than one baptismal formula was used . So long as we consider following Jesus to be the same as following the Father , Son , and Holy Spirit , no great damage would be done by such a difference . This does *not* mean that I think we should go back to using both formulae . Baptism is one of the few things that almost all Christian groups now recognize mutually , so I do not think doing something to upset that would be in the interests of the Gospel . This is reinforced by the fact that those groups that actually use `` in the name of Jesus '' now do seem to have in mind a difference in doctrine . But as I 've said before , I'm not the one to explain what their doctrine is . -- clh ]

Reply-To : S.Marshall @ dcs.hull.ac.uk Organization : Manchester Computing Centre , Manchester , England Lines : 42 Hi to all out there . We have this problem , and I 'm not certain I 'm solving it in the correct way . I was wondering if anyone can shed light on this , or point me in the right place to look ... We have an X-ray imaging camera and a metallic tube with a cylindrical hole passing through it at a right angle to the tube 's axis : | || [ image | X-ray source ] || | screen metallic || tube | || | | We know source -- screen centre distance , radius of the tube , radius of the hole . We do some calculations based on the image of the hole on the screen . However , the calculations are mathematically highly complex , and must assume that the object 's hole projects an image ( resembling an ellipse if the tube is not parallel to the screen ) in the centre of the screen . However , it is unlikely that the object is placed so conveniently . Firstly , we must transform the major and minor axis of the ellipse . I can not know what the angle between the tube and screen is . Do I have to assume that they are parallel to do the transformation ? How do I do this transformation ? Secondly , there is a distortion of the image due to the screen being planar ( the source -- screen distance increases as we move away from the centre of the screen ) . How can I compensate the ellipse 's axis for this image distortion ? So , please can anyone give us a few pointers here ? How do we transform the image so it appears as it would if it were in the centre of the screen , and how do I deal with distortion due to the shape of the screen ? We 'd appreciate any help , either posted or emailed .

First off , let me congratulate you for not posting a flame about `` You sick perverts , you are immoral , you are all going to hell . `` , which seems to be the usual `` religious '' post found on the alt.sex . * hierarchy . Hopefully , you won't get flamed , either . You will , however , be argued with . I personally think that your project is built on unsteady ground . First , I do not believe that there is any way to find an `` objective morality '' . Morality and value are inherently subjective - they represent the beliefs of a person or a group of people . They can be widely held , perhaps even overwhelmingly held , but they are never and _can_ never be objective . > Assumptions : > > ( 1 ) A Christian bedrock assumption that all that is True , comes > Truly from God . > > ( 2 ) Regarding alt.sex.stories .

Second , I do not accept the assumptions that you make here . If , as you say , you are trying to be objective , then why accept a morality to begin with by using the Christian Bible ? You 're defeating your own purpose by doing so . > In the long run , the advantage of making such a literary/moral > analysis is that it will save band-width between Christians and > non mutually flaming each other about the moral acceptability of > the stuff on these ( pornographic ) groups . Third , call me a pessimist , but you wo n't stop the flamage . There will always be people who pop upin alt.sex . * to tell us how sick and twisted and evil we all are . Just out of curiosity , do alt.sex readers show up unprovoked in the religion groups to tell you all that you are narrow-minded , censoring , overbearing totalitarianists ? > Basically , there should not be a dissonance between a `` Christian '' > morality and a `` non-Christian '' one . Either there is value in a > particular work , or there is not whether one is a Christian or > not . Hm . Let me provide an example . Four people get together over dinner , to discuss morality : you , me , a rather conservative Moslem , and a sociopath . I start off by saying that I think it 's immoral to force people to have sex with you . You agree , but also say that it is immoral to have sex with someone of your own gender . ( Just a note : I really do n't know your views on homosexuality , I am just using this as a common view of morality for the purposes of this example . ) The Moslem says that it is immoral for women to have their faces uncovered . The sociopath , who has become bored , kills all three of us and eats us , but feels no guilt because he has done nothing wrong morally in his own mind . > In support for the first assumption : > > The Christian scriptures say this : ( Evidence deleted ) I 'm not going to accept your evidence for this . You ask us to accept `` The Word of God '' that everything good comes from God . This is only a valid argument for a person who shares your beliefs .

So rewiring is still a part of this job , however , the ground may be connected to a local earth ground , rather than back at the breaker box . As Jamie said , GFCI devices are required by code in a number of places , most notably : bathrooms , and outside the house . I do suggest the use of GFCI outlets , rather than the breakers . You will end up with much less headaches . Noise pickup in long cable runs is sometimes enough to cause frequent tripping of the breakers .

From : amigan @ cup.portal.com ( Mike - Medwid ) Subject : Emphysema question Organization : The Portal System ( TM ) Distribution : na Lines : 14 A friend of mine is going in later this week for tests to see if has emphysema . His lung capacity has decreased over time . His father died of the disease . He works in woodworking . I believe he has a very occasional cigarette , perhaps one cigarette a day or even less . He tells me this..I 've never seen him light up . He has some pretty healthy life style habits , good diet , exercise , meditation , retreats , therapy etc . Anyhow..he is very concerned with this check up . I know really nothing about the disease . I believe it interferes with the lining of the lung being able to exchange oxygen . Is a diagnosis of emphysema a death sentence ? If he were to give up smoking entirely would that better his chances for recovery ? What are some modern therapies used in people with this disease ? I would appreciate any information . Thanks . amigan @ cup.portal.com

Read it again yourself , then re-apply the admonition you gave to the previous poster to yourself , as well . The first clause is not a condition , it is a reason for explicitly supporting the right WHICH EXISTS , MILITIA OR NOT , that the people have a right to keep and bear arms . This is NOT a right granted by the Constitution , it is a right presumed to exist by default . The Constitution mentioning a right is to prevent the government from removing that right by stating very clearly the government shall NOT infringe ( mess with , block , limit ) that right . Remember the Constitution is a bunch of negative things - things the government CAN NOT do . All rights , etc not epxressly given to the government go to the states and the PEOPLE ( the same people the other 9 Amendments in the Bill of Rights talk about ) . Since I am sure you will summarily reject my interpretation , I am appending a linguistic analysis by one far more expert than myself ( and you , I suspect ) . I am sure you will find his qualifications adequate . If that is n't enough I can send you the Senate Subcommitee to the Judiciary on the Constitution report on the same thing ... There are some things in there that Big Brother types , like Biden , etc must have really had to swallow hard to admit . I think you will find that people that seriously study the Constitution and state what it means will say the same thing . Those who come up with 'new improved meanings ' are those who are trying to subvert the Constitution for a given agenda . Like Clinton and his Clinton Cripple , Gun Control , People Control , and Control Control , and the whole nasty mess . Please tell us how this person is in error , wo n't you ? ( And please back it up with some proof , since I am backing my assertion up with independent proof , and have a BUNCH MORE I can provide ... ) . NOTE : Followups set to talk.politics.guns -- -- -- -- - Begin included article -- -- -- - THE UNABRIDGED SECOND AMENDMENT by J. Neil Schulman If you wanted to know all about the Big Bang , you 'd ring up Carl Sagan , right ? And if you wanted to know about desert warfare , the man to call would be Norman Schwarzkopf , no question about it . But who would you call if you wanted the top expert on American usage , to tell you the meaning of the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution ? That was the question I asked A.C. Brocki , editorial coordinator of the Los Angeles Unified School District and formerly senior editor at Houghton Mifflin Publishers -- who himself had been recommended to me as the foremost expert on English usage in the Los Angeles school system . Mr. Brocki told me to get in touch with Roy Copperud , a retired professor journalism at the University of Southern California and the author of '' American Usage and Style : The Consensus . '' A little research lent support to Brocki 's opinion of Professor Copperud's expertise . Roy Copperud was a newspaper writer on major dailies for over three decades before embarking on a a distinguished 17-year career teaching journalism at USC . Since 1952 , Copperud has been writing a column dealing with the professional aspects of journalism for `` Editor and Publisher '' , a weekly magazine focusing on the journalism field . He 's on the usage panel of the American Heritage Dictionary , and Merriam Webster 's Usage Dictionary frequently cites him as an expert . Copperud's fifth book on usage , `` American Usage and Style : The Consensus , '' has been in continuous print from Van Nostrand Reinhold since 1981 , and is the winner of the Association of American Publisher 's Humanities Award . That sounds like an expert to me . After a brief telephone call to Professor Copperud in which I introduced myself but did not give him any indication of why I was interested , I sent the following letter : '' I am writing you to ask you for your professional opinion as an expert in English usage , to analyze the text of the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution , and extract the intent from the text . `` The text of the Second Amendment is , ' A well-regulated Militia , being necessary for the security of a free State , the right of the people to keep and bear Arms , shall not be infringed . ' `` The debate over this amendment has been whether the first part of the sentence , ' A well-regulated Militia , being necessary to the security of a free State ' , is a restrictive clause or a subordinate clause , with respect to the independent clause containing the subject of the sentence , 'the right of the people to keep and bear Arms , shall not be infringed . ' `` I would request that your analysis of this sentence not take into consideration issues of political impact or public policy , but be restricted entirely to a linguistic analysis of its meaning and intent . Further , since your professional analysis will likely become part of litigation regarding the consequences of the Second Amendment , I ask that whatever analysis you make be a professional opinion that you would be willing to stand behind with your reputation , and even be willing to testify under oath to support , if necessary . '' My letter framed several questions about the test of the Second Amendment , then concluded : '' I realize that I am asking you to take on a major responsibility and task with this letter . I am doing so because , as a citizen , I believe it is vitally important to extract the actual meaning of the Second Amendment . While I ask that your analysis not be affected by the political importance of its results , I ask that you do this because of that importance . '' After several more letters and phone calls , in which we discussed terms for his doing such an analysis , but in which we never discussed either of our opinions regarding the Second Amendment , gun control , or any other political subject , Professor Copperud sent me the follow analysis ( into which I have inserted my questions for the sake of clarity ) : [ Copperud : ] `` The words ' A well-regulated militia , being necessary to the security of a free state , ' contrary to the interpretation cited in your letter of July 26 , 1991 , constitutes a present participle , rather than a clause . It is used as an adjective , modifying 'militia , ' which is followed by the main clause of the sentence ( subject 'the right ' , verb 'shall ' ) . The to keep and bear arms is asserted as an essential for maintaining a militia . `` In reply to your numbered questions : [ Schulman : ] `` ( 1 ) Can the sentence be interpreted to grant the right to keep and bear arms solely to ' a well-regulated militia ' ? '' [ Copperud : ] `` ( 1 ) The sentence does not restrict the right to keep and bear arms , nor does it state or imply possession of the right elsewhere or by others than the people ; it simply makes a positive statement with respect to a right of the people . '' [ Schulman : ] `` ( 2 ) Is 'the right of the people to keep and bear arms ' granted by the words of the Second Amendment , or does the Second Amendment assume a preexisting right of the people to keep and bear arms , and merely state that such right 'shall not be infringed ' ? '' [ Copperud : ] `` ( 2 ) The right is not granted by the amendment ; its existence is assumed . The thrust of the sentence is that the right shall be preserved inviolate for the sake of ensuring a militia . '' [ Schulman : ] `` ( 3 ) Is the right of the people to keep and bear arms conditioned upon whether or not a well regulated militia , is , in fact necessary to the security of a free State , and if that condition is not existing , is the statement 'the right of the people to keep and bear Arms , shall not be infringed ' null and void ? '' [ Copperud : ] `` ( 3 ) No such condition is expressed or implied . The right to keep and bear arms is not said by the amendment to depend on the existence of a militia . No condition is stated or implied as to the relation of the right to keep and bear arms and to the necessity of a well-regulated militia as a requisite to the security of a free state . The right to keep and bear arms is deemed unconditional by the entire sentence . '' [ Schulman : ] `` ( 4 ) Does the clause ' A well-regulated Militia , being necessary to the security of a free State , ' grant a right to the government to place conditions on the 'right of the people to keep and bear arms , ' or is such right deemed unconditional by the meaning of the entire sentence ? '' [ Copperud : ] `` ( 4 ) The right is assumed to exist and to be unconditional , as previously stated . It is invoked here specifically for the sake of the militia . '' [ Schulman : ] `` ( 5 ) Which of the following does the phrase 'well-regulated militia ' mean : 'well-equipped ' , 'well-organized , ' 'well-drilled , ' 'well-educated , ' or 'subject to regulations of a superior authority ' ? '' [ Copperud : ] `` ( 5 ) The phrase means 'subject to regulations of a superior authority ; ' this accords with the desire of the writers for civilian control over the military . '' [ Schulman : ] `` ( 6 ) ( If at all possible , I would ask you to take account the changed meanings of words , or usage , since that sentence was written 200 years ago , but not take into account historical interpretations of the intents of the authors , unless those issues can be clearly separated . '' [ Copperud : ] `` To the best of my knowledge , there has been no change in the meaning of words or in usage that would affect the meaning of the amendment . If it were written today , it might be put : `` Since a well-regulated militia is necessary tot he security of a free state , the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be abridged . ' [ Schulman : ] `` As a 'scientific control ' on this analysis , I would also appreciate it if you could compare your analysis of the text of the Second Amendment to the following sentence , '' A well-schooled electorate , being necessary to the security of a free State , the right of the people to keep and read Books , shall not be infringed . ' `` My questions for the usage analysis of this sentence would be , '' ( 1 ) Is the grammatical structure and usage of this sentence and the way the words modify each other , identical to the Second Amendment 's sentence ? ; and '' ( 2 ) Could this sentence be interpreted to restrict 'the right of the people to keep and read Books ' _only_ to ' a well-educated electorate ' -- for example , registered voters with a high-school diploma ? '' [ Copperud : ] `` ( 1 ) Your 'scientific control ' sentence precisely parallels the amendment in grammatical structure . `` ( 2 ) There is nothing in your sentence that either indicates or implies the possibility of a restricted interpretation . '' Professor Copperud had only one additional comment , which he placed in his cover letter : `` With well-known human curiosity , I made some speculative efforts to decide how the material might be used , but was unable to reach any conclusion . '' So now we have been told by one of the top experts on American usage what many knew all along : the Constitution of the United States unconditionally protects the people 's right to keep and bear arms , forbidding all governments formed under the Constitution from abridging that right . As I write this , the attempted coup against constitutional government in the Soviet Union has failed , apparently because the will of the people in that part of the world to be free from capricious tyranny is stronger than the old guard 's desire to maintain a monopoly on dictatorial power . And here in the United States , elected lawmakers , judges , and appointed officials who are pledged to defend the Constitution of the United States ignore , marginalize , or prevaricate about the Second Amendment routinely . American citizens are put in American prisons for carrying arms , owning arms of forbidden sorts , or failing to satisfy bureaucratic requirements regarding the owning and carrying of firearms -- all of which is an abridgement of the unconditional right of the people to keep and bear arms , guaranteed by the Constitution . And even the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) , staunch defender of the rest of the Bill of Rights , stands by and does nothing . it seems it is up to those who believe in the right to keep and bear arms to preserve that right . no one else will . No one else can . Will we beg our elected representatives not to take away our rights , and continue regarding them as representing us if they do ? Will we continue obeying judges who decide that the Second Amendment does n't mean what it says it means but means whatever they say it means in their Orwellian doublespeak ? Or will be simply keep and bear the arms of our choice , as the Constitution of the United States promises us we can , and pledge that we will defend that promise with our lives , our fortuned , and our sacred honor ?

It is n't so much a matter of 'interpretation ' of Bible texts that sets Mormonism apart from orthodoxy as it is a matter of *fabrication* . About 20 years ago , _National Lampoon_ had some comic strips in them that were drawn by Neal Adams . They were called `` Son o ' God '' comics . It was a parody of the Jesus in the Bible . In the comic , there were a group of thirteen Jewish kids from Brooklyn , and when one of them said the magic word , he turned into `` Son o ' God . '' He went from a myopic , curly headed , yarmulke wearing boy to a replica of the stylizied portraits of Jesus -- - with long flowing brown hair and gentile features . Now , if someone were to profess faith in this NatLamp Jesus , and claim that they were a Christian because they believed in this NatLamp Jesus , we would have to say that this was fallacious since this Jesus was a fabrication , and did not really exist . This is the exact same thing that the LDS do when they claim that they are Christian . They profess faith in Jesus , but the Jesus that they profess to have faith in is as much a fabrication as the NatLamp Jesus was . ============================= Robert Weiss psyrobtw @ ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu

Just in case : it is two strips of different metals bonded together , which when heated bend to one side ( check out the blinker globe in your christmas tree lights ) . So when you turn on the power , this causes the bulb to work like a neon , heating up and shorting out , thus providing a loop to power the heaters in the main tube . When the tube fires , insufficient current runs through the starter to keep the heat up and the bi-metalic strip straightens out ( O/C ) . BTW , I too thought that they were nothing more than a small neon , so one day when the neon in my sisters digital ( flip the metal squares type ) clock broke ( flimsy leads ) , I replaced it with one from a starter . Well powering up made a bit of a mess of the clock ! Cheers Peter T .

The point is that the original poster was talking about connecting ground and neutral in the *outlet* box ( big NO NO ) , and you are talking about them being connected in the breaker box ( as things should be ) . If this is not obvious , the point is that there should be current flow in the white , i.e . neutral/return wires when things in the house are operating . There should not be any flow in the ground wires unless there is a fault condition .

From : psionic @ wam.umd.edu ( Haywood J. Blowme ) Subject : new encryption Nntp-Posting-Host : rac3.wam.umd.edu Organization : University of Maryland , College Park Lines : 120 As promised , I spoke today with the company mentioned in a Washington Times article about the Clipper chip announcement . The name of the company is Secure Communicatiions Technology ( Information will be given at the end of this message on how to contact them ) . Basically they are disturbed about the announcement for many reasons that we are . More specifically however , Mr. Bryen of Secure Communications brought to light many points that might interest most of the readers . His belief is that AT & T was made known of the clipper well before the rest of the industry . This is for several reasons , several of which are : - A company of AT & T 's size could never be able to make a decision to use the new chip on the SAME DAY it was announced . - Months ago they proposed using their own chip for AT & T 's secure telephone devices . AT & T basically blew them off as being not interested at all . This stuck them as strange , until now ... Also I spoke with Art Melnick , their cryptographer , he expressed several concerns over the new Clipper Chip : - The obvious backdoor will be able to let many people decrypt the code . - Once the key is released to authorities the security of the crypto system is lost forever . These keys can end up in the hands of any agency of the government . - The fact that the escrowed keys never change means that the algorithm is vulnerable over time to an attacker . - The classified algorithm may hide another backdoor . But he feels that it is probably to keep people from forging fake serial numbers , or changing the keys themselves . - Additionally he feels that the NSA has probably spent enough time and money in working on a way to keep this chip from being reversed engineered , that he feels that reverse engineering it will be very difficult to do . He feels that they have developed a suitable technique to protect the chip from this attack . Also he feels that the chip is hardware encoded with the algorithm and not microcoded onto the chip . Additonally I spoke with Mr. Melnick about their algorithm . He could n't tell me much about their new agorithm because it has n't been patented yet . However he told me a little : - The algorithm will be released for public review after patents have been granted for it . This is so the crypto community can see that it is secure . - The algorithm is called NEA for New Encryption Algorithm . The details were sketchy because now it is held as a trade secret until the patent was issued , but I was told that it will incorporate the following : - It will have fast encryption of data ( Exact specs not given , but Mr. Melnick stated `` Much faster than what an RS-232 can put out . '' ) - It is a symmetric cipher , just like IDEA and DES . - It will use 64 bit data blocks for encryption ( like DES and IDEA ) . - The key length was not given to me , but Mr. Melnick states that it is _adujustable_ and is `` More than adequate for security . '' - The algorithm is written in C and Assembler in software form , and can be ported to many platforms ( Unlike the the Clipper Chip which is hardware ONLY and can not be made into software ) This I consider a definite plus for the NEA for widespread use . - The algorithm will accomodate public key distribution techniques such as RSA or Diffie-Hellman . This will also be supported in the hardware chip . - Right now the projected cost of the NEA chip will be about 10 dollars for each ! ! ( Clipper will run 25 each chip [ that is if it is produced enough , which probably wo n't happen ] ) . - They currently sell a program called C-COM that uses the algorithm and a special streaming protocol that does not divide the encrypted data into `` blocks . '' This could prevent plaintext attacks if you know what the block header is . This program operates at all supported RS-232 speeds and uses the software implementation of the algorithm . - Most importantly : IT DOES NOT HAVE A BACKDOOR ! ! Right now the company is afraid that the new clipper chip will put them out of business . This is a very real possibility . So they really need help in stopping the clipper chip from becoming a standard . If you want to contact them , they can be reached at..

A net-contact in L.A. tells me that the alert will remain over this weekend , as some elements may find excuse over the not-guilty verdicts on three of five charges ( the aiding-and-abetting ) . Those acquittals seem to balance out the fact that Rodney King himself was not any kind of angel that night , speeding and fleeing et al . However ... Another consideration is any street celebrations over the two convictions on the excessive force charges ( Koons for incompetance , and Powell for overreacting -- - both guilty as heck even from the view of NYPD cops interviewed ) that might get out of hand . ) - ; Also , some elements may take the acquittals as an excuse to challenge the cops ( a dumb move , obviously ) . And , Koreans are still scared and certain people are really mad over how they have armed themselves in the last year . A Commander from Nassau , Long Island was questioned about how his people would have handled Rodney King , and he said `` We 'd have let him roll around in the dirt 'til he got tired , then handcuff him '' . gld -- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Je me souviens ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Gary L.

I thought it > was a positive attempt to make the relations better . > **Compromise on what , the invasion of Cyprus , the involment of Turkey in **Greek politics , the refusal of Turkey to accept 12 miles of territorial **waters as stated by international law , the properties of the Greeks of **Konstantinople , the ownership of the islands in the Greek lake , sorry , Aegean . What compromise are you talking about on Cyprus . That is not Greece business to join the island to Greece . That is up to people in the island to live or not to live together . They made their decision and they are living separetely now.There is a peace there . Greeks ca n't slaughter Turks anymore because turkish peacemaking force is there . Your dream will never come true . 12 mile territorialwater ! ! ! ! Are you joking or dreaming ? We can declare our 12 miles territorial water which can come close to Athens . How would you like it ? If you have any guts why do n't you shoot at some Turkish ships in your dream 12 mile territorial waters ? We do not have any city called Konstantinople . We have a city called ISTANBUL ! ! ! ! All the greeks in Istanbul are being treated just any other Turks . There is no difference among people in Turkey . You look at your own backyard first before talking about human rights in Turkey . What are the rights of Turks in Greece ? Nothing . They do not even have basic human rights like right to have property , fredom of religion , fredom of press , fredom of vote elect their community leaders . Government of Greece publicly encourages people to destroy and burn schools , religious places , houses , and farms belong to turkish minority . Then , Greek government forces these minorities to go to Turkey without anything with them . You will dream to see Aegean sea as Greek lake but it will never happen . Think about the war between Turkey and Greece in 1915 . The river called SAKARYA flood 21 days filled with blood in 1915 . > The Greeks I mentioned who would n't talk to me are educated > people . They have never met me but they know ! I am bad person > because I am from Turkey . Politics is not my business , and it is > not the business of most of the Turks . When it comes to individuals > why the hatred ? **Any person who supports the policies of the Turkish goverment **directly or indirecly is a `` bad '' person . **It is not your nationality that makes you bad , it is your support **of the actions of your goverment that make you `` bad '' . **People do not hate you because of who you are but because of what you **are . You are a supporter of the policies of the Turkish goverment and **as a such you must pay the price . You mean that any person who supports the actions and policies of the government of Greece is a good person . That is your Greek idea to say Turks are bad people . We know who we are and proud to be TURKS anywhere in the world . That is not Greeks business to tell us what kind of people we are . You are not at position to judge people because you are not civilized enough to give equal rights to your own minorities . Millions of minorities are being treated as third class citizen , their rights are taken away from them , and they have no voices under the Government of Greece . They are almost being treated as slaves even though we are getting into 21th century . Therefore , do not make me laught at you . > So that makes me think that there is some kind of > brainwashing going on in Greece . After all why would an educated person > treat every person from a nation the same way ? can you tell me about your > history books and things you learn about Greek-Turkish > encounters during your schooling . > take it easy ! **You do not need brainwashing to turn people against the Turks.Just **as Greeks , Arats , Slavs , Kurds and all other people who had **the luck to be under Turkish occupation . **They will talk to you about murders , rapes , distruction . **You do not learn about Turks from history books , you learn about **them from people who experienced first hand Turkish friendliness . The Government of Greece is actively supporting terrorism against Turkey.Armenian and Kurdish terrorists have headquarters in Athens . They are being trained in special camps in Greece . They are taught how to kill innocent women and children.This not a claim , this is a fact known by whole world . In conlusion , you are in action to murder , rape , destroy the innocent people . I do not take you seriously because you are not at any positions to talk about human rights and dignity . Your own government , the Government of Greece actively supports atrocities in Bosnia . Serbs 's Barbarism pleases your government . Please Napoleon think twice before you write anything about Turks and Turkey . You are the worst in human right conditions and treatment of the minorities . Who wants to be a fried with someone whose government does not respect the human rights , supports terrorism in Turkey , barbaric actions in Bosnia , treats Turkish minorities as third class citizen and take away all of their rights , treating them as slaves at the beginning of 21th century ? ? ? ? ? ? ?

Subject : roman.bmp 01/14In response to the requests for cool bitmaps I am posting one . From : pwiseman @ salmon.usd.edu ( Cliff ) Reply-To : pwiseman @ salmon.usd.edu ( Cliff ) Distribution : usa Organization : University of South Dakota Lines : 978 Due to the resolution and size it is in 14 parts . This is a uuencoded bitmap . 960X600 256 colors . The picture is a marbled gazebo on a desert with blue sky background . The size is just right for centered wallpaper on a 1024x768 display because it leaves a border at the bottom just big enough for icons to fit in without being on top of the picture . Reguarding image quality and resolution - I have not seen much better . For those of you who have n't worked with pieced image files , here is how to put it back together . 1. save the 14 parts to 14 individual files 2. use a text editor to remove the header and footer in each file . 3. concatinate all the parts into a single file 4. uudecode the file There are tools available to do this without the hassle such as uuconvert ( UNIX ) and UUcoder ( Windows ) . If neccesary I could post these tools or where to get them by FTP -- let me know . -- -- -- -- -- -- Part 1 of 14 -- -- -- -- -- -- begin 644 ROMAN.BMP M0DT : S0 @ `` `` `` !

From : ahlenius @ rtsg.mot.com ( Mark Ahlenius ) Subject : converting color gif to X pixmap Summary : How to convert color gif to color pixmap Keywords : gif pixmap Nntp-Posting-Host : turquoise Organization : Motorola Inc. , Cellular Infrastructure Group Lines : 34 I have looked through the FAQ sections and have not seen a answer for this . I have an X/Motif application that I have written . I have a couple of gif files ( or pict ) that I have scanned in with a color scanner . Now I would like to be able to convert the gif files into a format that could be read into my application and displayed on the background of its main window . Preferably with pixmaps , or perhaps as an XImage . I have found functions in the pbmplus program suite to convert gif to xbm , but that is monochrome , and I really do need color . I have looked at xv , which reads in gif , and writes out several formats , but have not found a way to write out a file which can be read in as a pixmap . Is there an easy way to do this ? email responses preferred . thanks !

From : rps @ arbortext.COM ( Ralph Seguin ) Subject : finding out state of state keys ( eg , CapsLock and NumLock ) Organization : The Internet Lines : 19 To : xpert @ expo.lcs.mit.edu Hi . I 've looked in the FAQ and the O-Reilly books and was unable to find ( an easy ) means of finding out the state of state keys such as CapsLock and NumLock . I can certainly track the events inside of my window and set a boolean there , but what if CapsLock is pressed in another window ? I looked at XGrabKey ( ) and decided it was definitely NOT what I wanted to do . I could find no convenience function to tell me that information . My question is this : Is there a means of determining what the state of CapsLock and/or NumLock is ? An even more pointed question : Is there an easy means of making an X keyboard act like a PC keyboard ? ie , CapsLock is active , and the user presses shift-a , I 'd like to get a lowercase ' a ' instead of ' A ' . Any input is greatly appreciated . Please respond via email . I will repost a summary of my findings . Thanks , Ralph

What it demonstrates is that people will take > drugs if they want to , legal or not . Perhaps if your friend were taking > legal , regulated drugs under a doctors supervision he might not be in the > position he 's in now . > I do agree with you , in a way . The war on drugs has failed , but in my opinion , that does n't mean we have to give up . Only change the tactics . For instance , here are how some penalties should be changed . Dealing Coke -- Death Dealing Heroin -- Death Dealing Pot -- Death Dealing Crack -- Death The list goes on and on ! ! ! ... ... JUST KIDDING ! ! ! However , on a more serious note , I do believe that we should take some money away from the foriegn operations in South America and costly border interdiction efforts . ( Do n't think I 'm going to say , `` spend it to educate people '' , because I know plenty of educated dopers ) . Actually , spend it on things like drug treatment programs . I saw an interesting story on 60 minutes about how the British actually prescribe and addict his `` recommended '' dosage , and try to ween him off from it , or cut the amount down to levels where it is `` acceptable '' . Sounds good so far from what I heard with a decrease in cost , lower addiction rates by wiping out the dealer 's markets , etc . ( But that was the only thing I have heard about it . ) However , legalizing it and just sticking some drugs in gas stations to be bought like cigarettes is just plain silly . Plus , I have never heard of a recommended dosage for drugs like crack , ecstasy , chrystal meth and LSD . The 60 Minute Report said it worked with `` cocaine '' cigarettes , pot and heroin . Ryan

From : SHAGBERG @ vm.cmp.ilstu.edu Subject : converting keyboard for mac plus Organization : Illinois State University Lines : 35 I have an old Mac Plus . A couple of years ago I bought a shiney new lc . It came with apple 's new keyboard ( with abd ports ) . i replaced it with a mac-pro-plus extended keyboard ( which i thoroughly enjoy , thank you very much ) . well , i have this extra keyboard which i would like to use on the plus but there 's a little problem . the plus uses an rj-11 jack for keyboard input and the new keyboards do n't . i got an extra adb cable from my local apple dealer ( they 're such nice people ) , but they could n't tell me the order of the wires . there are four wires in the adb cables : black , white , red , tan . I know one 's a ground , one gets the serial signal , one supplies 5 volts , and i forgot what the fourth one does . anyway , if you hook them up wrong you 'll fry a board and i < really > do n't want to do < that > . if any brave souls out there have done this before , please e-mail your experience directly to me . i would greatly appreciate it especially since apple 's original keyboard is not . . . ergonomically correct . btw , i did take apart my new keyboard to see if i could find the correlation between the wires for the rj-11 jack and the adb since it has both , but no such luck ( the connections are soldered inside of little boxes ) .

This tends to make one assume there are few false arrest . From what I understand about radar dectectors all they are is a passive device much like the radio in your car . They work as an antenna picking up that radar signals that the radar gun sends out . Therefore there would be no way of detecting a radar detector any more than there would be of detecting whether some one had a radio in their car . Neal Howland nhowland @ matt.ksu.ksu.edu

YES ! I call this notion `` psychological health food '' and , in fact , have determined that the Four Food Groups are Ice Cream , Pizza , Barbecue , and Chocolate . Ideally , every meal should contain something from at least two of these four groups .

Yeah , I want to try one of those 42oz steaks ( cooked over applewood ) at Wally 's Wolf Lodge Inn in Coeur d'Alene . That seems quite unrealistic -- unrealistically SMALL . And a few slabs of ribs from the East Texas Smoker ( RIP , again ) in Louisville is not at all unrealistic either . What say we have a rec.food.cooking dinner at the Moonlite Bar-B-Que Inn in Owensboro ? ( It 's all you can eat including lamb ribs & mutton for about $ 10 . ) We could invite Julie Kangas as guest of honor and see if the Moonlite 's Very Hot Sauce is too hot for her . ( It IS too hot for me , and I do n't say that very often . ) And she could bring ice cream with crushed dried chiltepins for dessert . And we could see if there IS such a thing as an `` unrealistically large quantity '' of barbecue -- the owner of the Moonlite estimates that the Owensboro restaurants serve a hundred thousand pounds of meat a week in the summer , and forty thousand in the winter -- in a town of 50 000 or so . Two pounds per person per week ?

Is this true ? I own the Adcom 60W power amp . As far as I 'm concerned , there 's no amp which can touch it at the price range . The build quality is very impressive and is far superior to other amps in the price range . The whole amplifier is extremely solid with massive heat sinks and very solid casing . If you open the amp up , there are only very good quality components in and the amp seems to be designed extremely well . Perfect symmetry for both channels and TWO transformers - one for each channel . The binding posts on the back of the amplifier are virtually the same as those on the Classe model 70 ie . very good . I was also sceptical about the amps being built in the far-east or where-ever . But if you look in the amp and see what components they use and how it was designed , you can easily see why the amplifiers sound so brilliant . I can not see why people say the amplifier wo n't last - not with those quality components inside . Sure the amp runs very fairly hot - but that 's how you get an amp to sound incredibly good . My last point , I recently auditioned the Adcom preamp something like the 545 or something . It was two years old and it still sounded like new . If you build an amplifier decently , like the Adcom 's , they will sound brilliant and last a long time - period . Just my thoughts , but then - I do own one of Adcom 's amps . -- *********************************************************************** ** Alan Webber ** ** webb @ itu1.sun.ac.za ** ** webb @ itu2.sun.ac.za ** ** ** ** The path you tread is narrow and the drop is sheer and very high ** ** The ravens all are watching from a vantage point near by ** ** Apprehension creeping like a choo-train up your spine ** ** Will the tightrope reach the end ; will the final couplet rhyme ** ***********************************************************************

From : brownli @ ohsu.edu @ ohsu.edu ( Liane Brown ) Subject : DOCTRINE OF GOD Organization : Oregon Health Sciences University Lines : 111 This is being posted as a general outline for your personal study of this doctrine : THE DOCTRINE OF GOD I . THE PERSONS OF THE GODHEAD Of all of the doctrines of Scripture , this is the most important . The Bible is pre-eminently a revelation of God . Therefore , our first objective in studying the Bible should be to know God . I believe that the Bible teaches that there are Three Persons in the Godhead ( Trinity ) : God , the Father ; God the Son -- the Lord Jesus Christ ; and God , the Holy Spirit . I believe that they are individual Persons who are one in nature , meaning that They are identical in nature , each possessing the same divine attributes . They are also equally worthy of our worship , our trust , and our obedience . Cf . Matt.28:19 , 2 Cor.13:14 ; John 14:8,9,16,17 . II . THE ATTRIBUTES , or CHARACTERISTICS , OF THE GODHEAD . A . God 's nature is revealed in the Name He has taken for Himself : Jehovah . He is the living God , eternal , and unchanging . He is without beginning , and without ending . Cf . Isa.42:8 . B . God is a spirit . Cf . John 4:24 . C. God is love . Cf . 1 John 4:8,16 . As such , He is gracious , merciful , good , faithful , patient , and full of lovingkindness . Cf . Psa 89:1,2 ; Psa 103:8 ; Nahum 1:7 . D. But God is also holy and righteous . He is absolutely without sin in His nature , and so is incapable of sinning in though , word , or action . Cf . Ex . 15:11 ; Isa . 6:3 . E. God is omnipresent ( everywhere present at the same time in the completeness of His Person ) , omniscient ( all knowing , knowing all things -- the end from the beginning , infinitely wise ) , omnipotent ( almighty , sovereign , with unlimited power over all creation ) . God is infinite in His presence , wisdom , and power . It is my conviction that the work of the Lord in our day has become very man-centered , and that the people in our churches know very little about God . I believe that the Lord 's work needs to be God-centered , and that the people of God need to understand that God is sovereign in all things : in the affairs of nations , in the lives of all people , and in the carrying out of His purposes regarding salvation . III . THE WORKS OF THE GODHEAD . A . In creation All Three Persons of the Godhead were active in creating , and all Three are active in sustaining creation , and in ordering the course of human affairs ( for nations as well as individual people ) to the end of time . Cf . Gen. 1:1,2 ; John 1:1-3 ; Col. 1:16-17 ; Heb . 1:3 . B . In salvation In order to understand salvation I believe that it is absolutely necessary to begin with God , not with man . All three Persons of the Godhead have been , and are , active in salvation . 1 . God , the Father Salvation originated with God . The Members of the Godhead determined in eternity past that there would be salvation , the conditions under which people could and would be saved , and even who would be saved . Election to salvation is recognized in Scripture as the work of God , the Father . Cf . Eph 1:3-4 ; 2 Thess 2:13-14 . 2 . Christ , the Son of God The Lord Jesus Christ , through His birth by the virgin Mary , came to the earth to accomplish two important works : a . He came as the final and complete revelation of God , the Father . Cf . Col 1:15 ; heb 1:1-3. b . He came to provide salvation for all whom the Father had chosen . He did this by His death on the Cross , by His bodily resurrection , and by His present intercessory work in heaven . The work of salvation will be completed for us when the Lord returns . Cf . Rom 5:8-10 ; 1 Cor 15:3- 4 ; Heb 7:25 , 1 John 3:2 . 3 . The Holy Spirit As the Author of Scripture , the theme of which is Christ and His redemptive work , the Holy Spirit is carrying out the redemptive plan of God in the following ways : a . He convicts of sin . Cf . John 16:7-11 b . He regenerates ( known in the Bible as the new birth ) . Cf . John 3:5-8. c. He indwells each believer to fulfill the work of sanctification . Cf . John 14-16-17. d. He seals every believer in Christ , thus making salvation secure . Cf . Eph 1:13-14. e. He baptizes every believer into the body of Christ . Cf . Cor . 12:13 f. He teaches every believer the truth of Scripture . Cf . John 14:26. g. He bestows spiritual gifts on the people of God for ministry . ( Cf . 1 Cor 12 h. He restrains sin . Cf Gal 5:16-26. i . He empowers for living and for service . Cf . Acts 1:8 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Liane Brown ( Internet ) brownli @ ohsu.edu Portland Oregon

Box 605 Amherst , NY 14226-0605 COMPUTING CRATER DIAMETERS FROM EARTH-IMPACTING ASTEROIDS Astrogeologist Gene Shoemaker proposes the following formula , based on studies of cratering caused by nuclear tests . ( 1/3.4 ) D = S S c K W : crater diameter in km g p f n ( 1/6 ) S = ( g /g ) : gravity correction factor for bodies other than g e t Earth , where g = 9.8 m/s^2 and g is the surface e t gravity of the target body . This scaling is cited for lunar craters and may hold true for other bodies . ( 1/3.4 ) S = ( p / p ) : correction factor for target density p , p a t t p = 1.8 g/cm^3 for alluvium at the Jangle U a crater site , p = 2.6 g/cm^3 for average rock on the continental shields . C : crater collapse factor , 1 for craters < = 3 km in diameter , 1.3 for larger craters ( on Earth ) . ( 1/3.4 ) K : .074 km / ( kT TNT equivalent ) n empirically determined from the Jangle U nuclear test crater . 3 2 19 W = pi * d * delta * V / ( 12 * 4.185 * 10 ) : projectile kinetic energy in kT TNT equivalent given diameter d , velocity v , and projectile density delta in CGS units . delta of around 3 g/cm^3 is fairly good for an asteroid . An RMS velocity of V = 20 km/sec may be used for Earth-crossing asteroids . Under these assumptions , the body which created the Barringer Meteor Crater in Arizona ( 1.13 km diameter ) would have been about 40 meters in diameter . More generally , one can use ( after Gehrels , 1985 ) : Asteroid Number of objects Impact probability Impact energy diameter ( km ) ( impacts/year ) ( * 5*10^20 ergs ) 10 10 10^-8 10^9 1 1 000 10^-6 10^6 0.1 100 000 10^-4 10^3 assuming simple scaling laws . Note that 5*10^20 ergs = 13 000 tons TNT equivalent , or the energy released by the Hiroshima A-bomb . References : Gehrels , T. 1985 Asteroids and comets . _Physics Today_ 38 , 32-41 .

[ ... ] ( the date I have for this is 1-26-93 ) note Clinton 's statements about encryption in the 3rd paragraph.. I guess this statement doese n't contradict what you said , though . -- - cut here -- - WASHINGTON ( UPI ) -- The War on Drugs is about to get a fresh start , President Clinton told delegates to the National Federation of Police Commisioners convention in Washington . In the first speech on the drug issue since his innaugural , Clinton said that his planned escalation of the Drug War `` would make everything so far seem so half-hearted that for all practical purposes this war is only beginning now . '' He repeatedly emphasized his view that `` regardless of what has been tried , or who has tried it , or how long they 've been trying it , this is Day One to me . '' The audience at the convention , whose theme is `` How do we spell fiscal relief ? F-O-R-F-E-I-T-U-R-E , '' interrupted Clinton frequently with applause . Clinton 's program , presented in the speech , follows the outline given in his campaign position papers : a cabinet-level Drug Czar and `` boot camps '' for first-time youthful offenders . He did , however , cover in more detail his plans for improved enforcement methods . `` This year 's crime bill will have teeth , not bare gums , '' Clinton said . In particular , his administration will place strict controls on data formats and protocols , and require the registration of so-called `` cryptographic keys , '' in the hope of denying drug dealers the ability to communicate in secret . Clinton said the approach could be used for crackdowns on other forms of underground economic activity , such as `` the deficit-causing tax evaders who live in luxury at the expense of our grandchildren . '' Clinton expressed optimism that the drug war can be won `` because even though not everyone voted for Bill Clinton last November , everyone did vote for a candidate who shares my sense of urgency about fighting the drug menace . The advocates of legalization -- the advocates of surrender -- may be very good at making noise , '' Clinton said . `` But when the American people cast their ballots , it only proved what I knew all along -- that the advocates of surrender are nothing more than a microscopic fringe .

You mean you were opposed to US intervention in Somalia because since Somalia is a European country instead of the third world , the desire to help Somalia is racist ? I do n't think this `` same reason '' applies to Somalia at all . The whole point is that Somalia _is_ a third world country , and we were more willing to send troops there than to Bosnia -- exactly the _opposite_ of what the `` fixation on European countries '' theory would predict .

I can not imagine that they would not be used in a civil war . If nationialists take over and , even if they prevent a civil war , most feel they must take back large parts of land that are in other countries ( like Ukraine . ) I also can not imagine Ukraine giving up land without a fight , possibly nuclear .

The deuterocanonicals are not in the canon because they are not quoted by the NT authors . That is not quite accurate . Otherwise we would have the book of Enoch in the canon ( as Dave noted ) . One can say that the apocrypha are not quoted by Christ . Dave also writes : III . The deuterocanonicals are not in the canon because they teach doctrines contrary to the ( uncontroverted ) parts of the canon . then I answer : These is a logically invalid *a priori* . Besides , we are talking about OT texts- which in many parts are superceded by the NT ( in the Xtian view ) . Would not this same principle exclude _Ecclesiastes_ ? This principle can not be consistently applied . I have to reject your argument here . The Spirit speaks with one voice , and he does not contradict himself . The ultimate test of canonicity is whether the words are inspired by the Spirit , i.e. , God-breathed . It is a test which is more guided by faith than by reason or logic . The early church decided that the Apocrypha did not meet this test -- even though some books such as The Wisdom of Ben Sirach have their uses . For example , the Lutheran hymn `` Now Thank We All Our God '' quotes a passage from this book . The deutero-canonical books were added much later in the church's history . They do not have the same spiritual quality as the rest of Scripture . I do not believe the church that added these books was guided by the Spirit in so doing . And that is where this sort of discussion ultimately ends . David H.

My intuition says that things should be easier , but is this so ? If anyone has a solid and complete solution to my problem , please let me know .

I do n't claim to be an expert on the branch Davidians , but I might know more than most . The Branch Davidian group ( led by Koresh ) is actually one of two off-shoots of a group known as the Shephard 's Rod . The Shephard 's Rod ( now defunct as far as I know ) broke off from the SDA Church in the 30 's . The Shephard 's Rod broke away from the SDA Church because they felt that the SDA Church was becoming weak and falling into apostacy . They felt that they were the remnant spoken about in Revelation . About the Koresh group , Koresh gained control of it in 1987 or 1988 . Once in control , he made himself the center of it . He proclaimed himself as Christ . Koresh himself came from an SDA background . He was excommunicated as a young adult by the local congregation for trying to exert too much control over the youth in the church . After this , he joined the Branch Davidians . They were/are a survivalist cult . This is why they had the stockpile of weapons , food , a bomb shelter , etc . They had no intent of raiding the US government or anything . They were preparing for Armaggedon and were putting themselves in a self defense position . In my opinion , if the ATF and the FBI had left well enough alone , we wouldn' t have the blood of 20+ children crying out from the ashes in Waco . If you want to know about The Shephard 's Rod , you might want to visit the local SDA church and talk to some of the older people . They could give you some insight into where Koresh got his theology . Tammy

A lot of people have suffered because of similar beliefs . Jesus said that people would come to Him saying `` Lord , Lord , '' and proclaiming the miraculous works they had done in His name .

The report on Western Thrace emphasized that the Greek government should grant social and political rights to all the members of minorities that are equal to those enjoyed by Greek citizens and in addition they must recognize the existence of the `` Turkish Minority '' in Western Thrace and grant them the right to identify themselves as 'Turks ' . NEWSPOT , May 1992 |2| GREECE ISOLATES WEST THRACE TURKS The Xanthi independent MP Ahmet Faikoglu said that the Greek state is trying to cut all contacts and relations of the Turkish minority with Turkey . Pointing out that while the Greek minority living in Istanbul is called `` Greek '' by ethnic definition , only the religion of the minority in Western Thrace is considered . In an interview with the Greek newspaper `` Ethnos '' he said : `` I am a Greek citizen of Turkish origin . The individuals of the minority living in Western Trace are also Turkish . '' Emphasizing the education problem for the Turkish minority in Western Thrace Faikoglu said that according to an agreement signed in 1951 Greece must distribute textbooks printed in Turkey in Turkish minority schools in Western Thrace . Recalling his activities and those of Komotini independent MP Dr. SadIk Ahmet to defend the rights of the Turkish minority , Faikoglu said . `` In fact we helped Greece . Because we prevented Greece , the cradle of democracy , from losing face before European countries by forcing the Greek government to recognize our legal rights . '' On Turco-Greek relations , he pointed out that both countries are predestined to live in peace for geographical and historical reasons and said that Turkey and Greece must resist the foreign powers who are trying to create a rift between them by cooperating , adding that in Turkey he observed that there was will to improve relations with Greece . NEWSPOT , January 1993 |3| MACEDONIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS TO FACE TRIAL IN GREECE . Two ethnic Macedonian human rights activists will face trial in Athens for alleged crimes against the Greek state , according to a Court Summons ( No . 5445 ) obtained by MILS . Hristos Sideropoulos and Tashko Bulev ( or Anastasios Bulis ) have been charged under Greek criminal law for making comments in an Athenian magazine . Sideropoulos and Bulev gave an interview to the Greek weekly magazine `` ENA '' on March 11 , 1992 , and said that they as Macedonians were denied basic human rights in Greece and would field an ethnic Macedonian candidate for the up-coming Greek general election . Bulev said in the interview : `` I am not Greek , I am Macedonian . '' Sideropoulos said in the article that `` Greece should recognise Macedonia . The allegations regarding territorial aspirations against Greece are tales ... We are in a panic to secure the border , at a time when the borders and barriers within the EEC are falling . '' The main charge against the two , according to the court summons , was that `` they have spread ... intentionally false information which might create unrest and fear among the citizens , and might affect the public security or harm the international interests of the country ( Greece ) . '' The Greek state does not recognise the existence of a Macedonian ethnicity . There are believed to be between 350,000 to 1,000,000 ethnic Macedonians living within Greece , largely concentrated in the north . It is a crime against the Greek state if anyone declares themselves Macedonian . In 1913 Greece , Serbia-Yugoslavia and Bulgaria partioned Macedonia into three pieces . In 1919 Albania took 50 Macedonian villages . The part under Serbo-Yugoslav occupation broke away in 1991 as the independent Republic of Macedonia . There are 1.5 million Macedonians in the Republic ; 500,000 in Bulgaria ; 150,000 in Albania ; and 300,000 in Serbia proper . Sideropoulos has been a long time campaigner for Macedonian human rights in Greece , and lost his job as a forestry worker a few years ago . He was even exiled to an obscure Greek island in the mediteranean . Only pressure from Amnesty International forced the Greek government to allow him to return to his home town of Florina ( Lerin ) in Northern Greece ( Aegean Macedonia ) , where the majority of ethnic Macedonians live . Balkan watchers see the Sideropoulos affair as a show trial in which Greece is desperate to clamp down on internal dissent , especially when it comes to the issue of recognition for its northern neighbour , the Republic of Macedonia . Last year the State Department of the United States condemned Greece for its bad treatment of ethnic Macedonians and Turks ( who largely live in Western Thrace ) . But it remains to be seen if the US government will do anything until the Presidential elections are over .

It would seem that the one fact that the government has overlooked in this whole fiasco is the economic standpoint . As others have mentioned , the most difficulty the Clipper chip faces is an economic one . Let 's face it , the average consumer does n't care or know that the Clipper is a bad idea . If there is a perceived need for cellular encryption , then the companies will provide one . Most likely , a standard will emerge . But if the Clipper is too expensive ( and $ 25 a chip is way too much ) then they will develope their own or buy a cheaper one .

This indicates confusion between `` proof '' and the process > of doing science . You are making precisely one of the points I wanted to make . I fully agree with you that there is a big distinction between the *process* of science and the end result . As an end result of science , one wants to get results that are objectively verifiable . But there is nothing objective about the *process* of science . If good empirical research were done and showed that there is some merit to homeopathic remedies , this would certainly be valuable information . But it would still not mean that homeopathy qualifies as a science . This is where you and I disagree with Turpin . In order to have science , one must have a theoretical structure that makes sense , not a mere collection of empirically validated random hypotheses . Experiment and empirical studies are an important part of science , but they are merely the culmination of scientific research . The most important part of true scientific methodology is SCIENTIFIC THINKING . Without this , one does not have any hypotheses worth testing . ( No , hypotheses do not just leap out at you after you look at enough data . Nor do they simply come to you in a flash one day while you 're shaving or looking out the window . At least not unless you 've done a lot of really good thinking beforehand . ) The difference between a Nobel Prize level scientist and a mediocre scientist does not lie in the quality of their empirical methodology . It depends on the quality of their THINKING . It really bothers me that so many graduate students seem to believe that they are doing science merely because they are conducting empirical studies . And it bothers me even more that there are many fields , such as certain parts of psychology , where there seems to be no thinking at all , but mere studies testing ad hoc hypotheses . And I 'm especially offended by Russell Turpin 's repeated assertion that science amounts to nothing more than avoiding mistakes . Simply avoiding mistakes does n't get you anywhere . -- In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists , psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects . lady @ uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu lady @ uhunix.bitnet

From : dmcaloon @ tuba.calpoly.edu ( David McAloon ) Subject : PLANETS STILL : IMAGES ORBIT BY ETHER TWIST Organization : California Polytechnic State University , San Luis Obispo Lines : 234 ETHER IMPLODES 2 EARTH CORE , IS GRAVITY ! ! ! This paper BOTH describes how heavenly bodys can be stationary , ether sucking structures , AND why we observe `` orbital '' motion ! ! Ether , the theoretical propogation media of electro-magnetic waves , was concluded not to exist , based on the results of the Michelson-Moreley experiment conducted a century ago . I propose that those conclusions are flawed , based on the fact that the experiment was designed to look for a flow parallel to the earth 's surface , not perpindicular . ( Due to the prevailing assumption that the earth traveled through the ether as a ball through the wind ) The reversal of the that conclusion , a pivotal keystone in the development of modern scientific thought , could have ramifications of BIBLICAL proportions through out the WORLD ! ! REMEMBER : Einstien said Imagination is greater than knowledge ! ! 1 I dream like this : ether based reality The ether is like a fluid out of phase with our reality . Creations start as a lattice placed into the ether . Given a spin , the lattices both drag the fluid , like a margarita blender , and ingest it , converting it , distilling localized mass , time and energy . ( non-spinning lattice = `` dark matter '' ) The earth is n't exactly spinning , around the sun . Picture an image of a galaxy ; we have n't any videos of them spinning . Picture us being stationary , and the sun 's image being dragged across the sky by the spinning ether field . ( Picture an onion , each layer of which is spinning a little faster than the next . A thread shot at the inner kernel would be stretched diagonally sideways , its head being in a faster shell than its tail , until it finally intersected the ground of the inner kernel , its direction vector being straight down , but its `` foot print '' being a line , not a point . [ sunrise , sunset ] ) The moon is n't exactly orbiting us . It is a parasite , ( non self spin sustaining ) being dragged in the earth 's ether field , which is itself in the sun 's much more powerful field . Our seasons are the wobble of earth 's axis , like a top slowing down . The `` orbit '' of the earth around the sun is all of the stars ' images being dragged around by the sun 's ether feild . The earth , moon and sun are about the same size and `` distance '' apart . Its just that the time between them varies greatly , because the `` path '' is not the same . The moon 's lattice in the ether is like sticking a fork in a plate of spaghetti and giving the plate a half turn . The sun 's lattice has so much spin that its like the fork has got the whole plate of noodles wound up . The piece of light going to the moon can slide down the spaghetti and maybe make a `` j '' hook at the end . The piece of light going to the sun has to go around the whole plate , like a needle in a record , before it gets there . With a pencil , compass , and rule , draw a diagram of how the moon can be about as big as `` earth 's '' shadow upon it , and at other times totally eclipse the sun . Look in the sky . except for your Knowledge , would you guess that they are about the same size , just because they look about the same size ? O . - - E O O O S E / \ M | | OR M \ _ _ / S The full moon , quarter moon etc . is the difference between rate of ether spins . What we are looking at is a rotating `` turntable view '' of the moon , only half of which is facing the sun . ( I 've seen a half moon within about 120 degrees ( of sky ) of the sun , during the day . Try and draw that `` earth shadow . '' ) Its only the moon 's image which appears to orbit us . No matter where it is , the light part is the part facing the sun , and the dark part is the half facing away from the sun , even when it appears to be behind us . `` Light-Years '' between galaxies is a misnomer . The distance is closer to zero , as time and matter are characteristics of this phase of reality , which dissipates outward with each layer of the onion . ( defining edge = 0 ether spin ) What we are seeing could be essentially happening now . The `` piece '' of light may have experienced many years , but the trip could be very quick , our time . To time travel or warp space I might consider learning to de-spin myself . ( phase out my mass ) Good luck trying to design a propulsion system to drag around a space-time locality . ( its like trying to move a balloon by shooting a squirt gun from within ) To find out about all of this , I recommend studying history . I 'd look in the book of life . ( or holy grail etc . ) Brain waves just might carry decipherable data . I 'd start looking on some part of the spectra said to be unusable , due to all the background noise . ( 4+ billion humans ? ) I 'd totally isolate myself , record me thinking DOG backwards , and learn to read what I got . ( Microsoft Holy Grail card for Pentium ! ) Next , concluding that my thoughts were recorded on a non time-bound media , the ether , and that it is I who move forward ( in time ) . I would try to temporarily locally reverse the flow , ( of time , which I 'd start looking for as flowing opposite magnetism , pole to pole . [ Why not ? ] ) perhaps by passing a LARGE , FLAT DC current through a two foot diameter . coil or choke or something , and seeing what I could get with my machine 's receiver next to it . If you do n't think you 'll live to see it , consider this : QUIT PUTTING THE REPRODUCTIVE KEYS OF OTHER LIFE IN YOUR BODY ! All of life 's data could be written on the wind , ( ether ) not just our thoughts . DNA could be a little receiver or file access code . By eating SEEDS , we could be jamming our reception , or receiving plant instructions . Try eating seed bearing fruit . Maybe those Greek or biblical guys did live hundreds of years . I 'm curios to see what they did and ate . Do n't worry if your hair stops growing . ( Maybe we do n't need to eat at all , the cosmos are formed from nothing , and that is creating matter ! I only need enough to bounce around . Where did the household concept 'immortal ' come from ? Wheat is a weed , it is programmed to pull from the soil , reproduce like hell , and then die ) Warning about writing to the past : I had a little dream of being in a world , in the near parallel future , lying along a path of history which we have diverged from . There were ; twelve telepathic , glowing beings , who looked like an Oscar award and who had always been , a dark one who looked like us , and then myself . The dark one was in the process of making the others into gods , ( he had to teach them what that meant ) by '' advising '' them in their past . Basically , he manipulated them into reproducing , and raising their children on his seed . He said that the little ones who looked different were a sub-species , meant to provide service . He carefully combed through history , rewriting it in his favor , pulling like a weed anything that compromised his control . He enticed recruits by sending them his visions , saying that there was immortality at the end of the road for only twelve souls : kill or be killed . The amount of control he could exert was finite , though , as at every change he made , a void would appear in our reality . The universe one day ended 100 meters from us : it seemed odd , but we could n't remember how else it should be . Then some of the twelve were no more . Finally , when he could prune no more , and reality stopped just beyond his fingertips , he stepped through his portal to the past , to bask , over and over , in all that he had created . I made a few more changes , and lost my body , existing only on the wind . MORAL : Its very possible to eliminate from your reality the souls whose will 's are not in harmony with yours ( Golden Rule - treat others as you wish to be treated ) I.E. , you could end up along a lonely thread of time with murderers or flowery brown-nosers for playmates . ( its not eternal , there 's more than one way back ) Accepting rides to the past : Once here , the one who looks like us sells rides , he can make you a Prince , or a Queen , or you can live as a god in ancient Greece . Go ahead , repeat the third grade as often as you like , Adam henry . I Hope you like inspecting your socks . Careful though , if he likes your work , but thinks you 're getting wise , he can direct you to cross paths with your old self , and you 'll vanish as you rewrite your own course of history , none the wiser . As we pass the point along the parallel line where he stepped back in time , his hierarchy will lose its direction . He can still make changes while he 's here , its just that that is work , and with every 'adjustment ' , this becomes less the world he cultivated , which loosens his grip , and his organization is suddenly one branch less . But he ca n't see the change . The basic nature of man is good . He had to apply his hand to achieve his world . As he now tightens his hand to retain what he built , the more sand slips through his fingers . How about public computer access to the I.R.S . ? Its our country , our money , and they 're spending it on us , RIGHT ? Imagine this : Washington marks the next cost at 8 , IRS collects 10 , gives 5 to congress , and just absolutely buries 5 . Congress borrows 2 . The banks are making , what , a 30 % margin ( interest ) on our government ? Big corporations are ecstatic if they can do a 10 % margin . What do the banks do with it ? Hold some on a carrot to the world , sure , but mostly , bury it . WHY ? Food production is 2 % GNP ? , construction 6 % ? 14 hours to build your auto ? The people are spending all of their time to buy back a tenth of what they produce . Have we been deceived ? If we are more efficient , why is it getting harder to get by ? What if the point is just to keep the people busy making widgets ? In that other reality , I shouted to the twelve , `` its chaos ! '' They said , `` no , its order . '' He defined chaos as that which is he was not able to control . Rain forest : The problem could be that all the water in its canopy would hide the location of an indigenous people who have no language . ( telepathic ; and 'vanishing ' the closest knowledge of death ) ( think of the spine as a transceiver , if it is on the ground and pointed up , you can locate it from above ) These people are probably naive as children , but very , very tough to kill . Also , They should be able to tell you stories about the dark one that I talk about . They can hear him . I think that Ham and world band radio old timers might have a story to tell on this . These people would be on a different frequency than us as they are n't eating seeds . Famine relief : When I make my diet almost all whole wheat , I get a huge belly , lose muscle mass , sleep A LOT , and get sick . When I eat only fresh fruit , I get more energy , a Hollywood-flat belly , and need a lot less sleep . UN . Peace Keeping ; There is fighting and killing all over . The troops go in when there is no bread on the shelf . ( its OK to kill each other , just make sure there is enough to eat . ) Somalia : What is disturbing is energetic , gun carrying , three foot tall sixteen year-olds , who eat nothing but some roots that they suck on . It is not so much that their growth is stunted , it is that they are n't dying at a rate of 50 of 60 years per life . Women with children , Babes in arms : Historical references to women and children as a single unit could mean that infants were not cut from the umbilical cord . ( and hence , were not breast fed ) I think that there may be some very interesting results to this , such as mother-child telepathy , and blue blooded infants . There are examples of this practice in the aquatic mammal kingdom to investigate . That guy is the master of illusion , and the ultimate liar . He tells it first , and then just follows the thread of time in which the people are willing to buy it . ( in which he can make it so ) He 'll play a poker face up until he thinks he 's cornered , and then he 'll whine , beg and grovel . All it means to him is that you 're willing to live on the ground work that he has laid , that is , that he was right , and he did n't over play his hand , and he wo n't need to go back and try another thread of time . You have ultimate control over your destiny , just do n't live along a path that leads to a reality in which you do n't want to be a part of . I do n't claim to be the first to think these things , its just that the others could have been 'pruned ' from our path . Maybe these thoughts given to me were laid down on the track of time , after him .

In four replies , I 've seen no hard numbers , so here goes : For traces on the outside ( not inner layers ) , expect , in 1 oz copper , at 15 amps , the following temperature rises versus width .

Power goes as square of the current , plus the copper resistance goes up as temperature goes up ... Certainly .20 '' ( ~5mm ) traces should be ample for what you want to do . And 2 ounce copper almost cuts the required width in half . ( I 'd do 2 oz at about 0.08 '' width myself , I think ... given that the _rated_ current is 10 amps and the 15 is a transient or fault condition . ) ( There 's another question : will the voltage drop be low enough ? But you should be able to figure this one out with wire tables or just the resistivity of copper . Keep traces short and use separate sensing traces where appropriate , as mentioned by another poster . )

Infantile spasms have been well understood for quite some time now . You are seeing a pediatric neurologist , are n't you ? If not , I strongly recommend it . There is a new anticonvulsant about to be released called felbamate which may be particularly helpful for infantile spasms .

I guess I might believe anything . > > Whats the scoop on this standalone `` drive activity '' every 20 sec ? I can only comment on thermal recalibration in general . Some new drives perform it in order to increase overall integrity of data writes . Basically , the firmware instructs the actuator to perform a test to see if the data tracks are within a certain physical tolerance , since when the media heats up or cools down , *some* track drift is inevitable , and the drive has to monitor it . This becomes especially critical at very high recording densities , and so was used primarily on very large-capacity mechanisms , but it seems to be finding its way into more smaller drives as a way of boosting the drive 's long-term reliability and MTBF ratings . I first became aware of thermal recalibration when it was pointed out that the technique conflicts with prolonged write times when digitizing , say , audio or video to hard disk . Some manufacturers explicitly state that drives with thermal recalibration are NOT to be used for applications that have prolonged disk writes . Hope this helps . Victor

It was the Phils only win in the three game series , and was the first time the Phillies have lost a series in the young season . The Phils jumped to a 6-0 lead in the game thanks to 2 John Kruk 2-run homers and two Wes Chamberlain homers . However Danny Jackson , and the Phillies middle relief was unable to hold the lead . Mitch Williams entered the game with the Phillies leading 8-4 , however Candy Maldonado hit a ninth inning homerun to tie it . In the 11th , Dave Hollins hit a three-run shot , his first of the year to push the Phils ahead to stay . However , in a shaky bottom of the 11th the Cubs scored 2 runs and had the tying runner on base when the Cubs pinch hit Randy Myers for Bob Scanlan ( they were out of position players ) and Myers bunted into a double play to end the game . The Phils bring their league leading 9-3 record back to action Tuesday , Wednesday , and Thursday against the Padres .

If a six year old child does a funny trick and you say well done he will do it again and it may be funny . Then they may repeat it over and over again bu you still have to pretend its funny even though it is n't any more . Once they are older than six you expect them to realise that doing the same thing over and over again is n't funny any more . Basicaly Ed fails to be amusing because he is merely crass . He does not make jokes that have any political content beyond attempting to ridicule their target . Calling someone Slick Willie is not funny even if you put on a red nose while you say it , it was a good debating point used on the spur of the moment 12 months ago but now its use merely demonstrates that the user could n't think of anything original to say . In the UK there is a tradition of old retired Colnels who bore the dinner guests rigid with their descriptions of old campagns .

From : Grant @ DOCKMASTER.NCSC.MIL ( Lynn R Grant ) Subject : Another key registration body bites the dust ( IMHO ) Organization : Yale CS Mail/News Gateway Lines : 46 One of the candidates that has been suggested for a key registration body is the ACLU . I think this is poor choice . The ACLU is essentially a group of auditors : they audit how people 's civil liberties are administered . Traditionally , auditors do not like to get involved in the design or operational aspects of things , and with good reason . When I was a systems programmer , it always infuriated me that the auditors would come in and tell us our implementation stunk from a security point of view , but would n't tell us how to fix it . I always figured they just liked to critcize , without doing the work to help fix the problem . Then I took a stint as an auditor , and I found out the real reason . Auditors do n't like to recommend solutions , because it puts them in a bad position if they have to criticize the implementation later . The auditee can say , `` Well , you told us this way would be OK. '' It compromises the independence that is a necessary part of the auditor's job . Taking the case at hand , suppose ACLU becomes a key half registrar . Suppose that , perhaps through some error on ACLU 's part , a key half gets away that should n't , and is used to deprive someone of her civil liberties . The ACLU gets wind of this , and wants to take it to court . But they end up being at the same time on the side of the defendant and of the plaintiff , which is not an easy position to be in . There are exceptions to the complete independence of auditors : at one place where I worked , when payroll checks were printed , they were signed automatically by a signature drum on the bursting machine . This drum was kept by the auditors ( who also kept the check stock ) , and was brought down to Data Processing when it was time to do the checks . I believe the difference between this situation and the key registration situation is that it is fairly obvious when it is time to do the payroll checks : if they were done yesterday , and someone wants to do them again today , he better be able to produce yesterday 's checks so that they can be destroyed . Determining which of the many requests for key halves are legit is a trickier process , one much more prone to mistakes that could put the ACLU in a protecting-the-client versus protecting-the-ACLU conflict of interest . As always , my opinions are my own . Lynn Grant Grant @ Dockmaster.NCSC.MIL

It does not go into great detail , and is almost certainly not exhaustive . Obviously , many of the weaknesses are weaknesses of cryptographically secured mail in general , and will pertain to secure mail programs other than RIPEM . It is maintained by Marc VanHeyningen < mvanheyn @ cs.indiana.edu > . It is posted monthly to a variety of news groups ; followups pertaining specifically to RIPEM should go to alt.security.ripem . CRYPTANALYSIS ATTACKS -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - - Breaking RSA would allow an attacker to find out your private key , in which case he could read any mail encrypted to you and sign messages with your private key . RSA is generally believed to be resistant to all standard cryptanalytic techniques . Even a standard key ( about 516 bits with RIPEM ) is long enough to render this impractical , barring a huge investment in hardware or a breakthrough in factoring . - Breaking DES would allow an attacker to read any given message , since the message itself is encrypted with DES . It would not allow an attacker to claim to be you . DES has only 56 bits in its key , and thus could conceivably be compromised by brute force with sufficient hardware , but few agencies have such money to devote to simply read one message . Since each message has a different DES key , the work for each message would remain high . KEY MANAGEMENT ATTACKS -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Stealing your private key would allow the same benefits as breaking RSA . To safeguard it , it is encrypted with a DES key which is derived from a passphrase you type in . However , if an attacker can get a copy of your private keyfile and your passphrase ( by snooping network packets , tapping lines , or whatever ) he could break the whole scheme . The main risk is that of transferring either the passphrase or the private key file across an untrusted link . So do n't do that . Run RIPEM on a trusted machine , preferably one sitting right in front of you . Ideally , your own machine in your own home ( or maybe office ) which nobody else has physical access to . - Fooling you into accepting a bogus public key for someone else could allow an opponent to deceive you into sending secret messages to him rather than to the real recipient . If the enemy can fool your intended recipient as well , he could re-encrypt the messages with the other bogus public key and pass them along . It is important to get the proper public keys of other people . The most common mechanism for this is finger ; assuming the opponent has not compromised routers or daemons or such , finger can be given a fair amount of trust . The strongest method of key authentication is to exchange keys in person ; however , this is not always practical . Having other people `` vouch for you '' by signing a statement containing your key is possible , although RIPEM does n't have features for doing this as automatically as PGP . RIPEM does generate and check MD5 fingerprints of public keys in the key files ; they may be exchanged via a separate channel for authentication . PLAYBACK ATTACKS -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Even if an opponent can not break the cryptography , an opponent could still cause difficulties . For example , suppose you send a message with MIC-ONLY ( a PEM mode which does not provide disclosure protection ) to Alice which says `` OK , let 's do that . '' Your opponent intercepts it , and now resends it to Bob , who now has a message which is authenticated as from you telling him to do that . Of course , he may interpret it in an entirely different context . Or your opponent could transmit the same message to the same recipient much later , figuring it would be seen differently at a later time . Or the opponent could change the Originator-Name : to himself , register your public key as his , and send a message hoping the recipient will send him return mail indicating ( perhaps even quoting ! ) the unknown message . To defeat playback attacks , the plaintext of each message should include some indication of the sender and recipient , and a unique identifier ( typically the date ) . A good front-end script for RIPEM should do this automatically ( IMHO ) . As a recipient , you should be sure that the Originator-Name : header and the sender indicated within the plaintext are the same , that you really are a recipient , and that the message is not an old one . Some this also can and should be automated . The author of this FAQ has made a modest attempt at automating the process of generating and checking encapsulated headers ; the programs are included in the standard distribution in the utils directory . LOCAL ATTACKS -- -- -- -- -- -- - - Clearly , the security of RIPEM can not be greater than the security of the machine where the encryption is performed . For example , under UNIX , a super-user could manage to get at your encrypted mail , although it would take some planning and effort to do something like replace the RIPEM executable with a Trojan horse or to get a copy of the plaintext , depending how it 's stored . In addition , the link between you and the machine running RIPEM is an extension of that . If you decrypt with RIPEM on a remote machine which you are connected to via network ( or , worse yet , modem ) , an eavesdropper could see the plaintext ( and probably also your passphrase . ) RIPEM should only be executed on systems you trust , obviously . In the extreme case , RIPEM should only be used on your own machine , which you have total control over and which nobody else has access to , which has only carefully examined software known to be free of viruses , and so on . However , there 's a very real trade-off between convenience and security here . A more moderately cautious user might use RIPEM on a UNIX workstation where other people have access ( even root access ) , but increase security by keeping private keys and the ( statically linked , of course ) executable on a floppy disk . Some people will keep RIPEM on a multi-user system , but when dialing in over an insecure line , they will download the message to their own system and perform the RIPEM decryption there . However , the security provided by such a mechanism is somewhat illusory ; since you presumably type your cleartext password to log in , you 've just given away the store , since the attacker can now log in as you and install traps in your account to steal your private key next time you use it from a less insecure line . This will likely remain the situation as long as most systems use the rather quaint mechanism of cleartext password authentication . I find it nice to put a brief statement of how carefully I manage my security arrangement in my .plan next to my public key , so that potential correspondents can be aware what level of precautions are in place . Some people use two keys , a short one which is not carefully managed for ordinary use and a longer one which is treated with greater care for critical correspondence . UNTRUSTED PARTNER ATTACKS -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - - RIPEM 's encryption will ensure that only a person with the private key corresponding to the public key used to encrypt the data may read the traffic . However , once someone with that key gets the message , she may always make whatever kind of transformations she wishes . There exist no cryptographic barriers to a recipient , say , taking an ENCRYPTED message and converting it to a MIC-ONLY message , signed by you and readable by anyone , although RIPEM does not provide this functionality . Indeed , the latest PEM draft I have seen specifically states that such transformations should be possible to allow forwarding functions to work . Including the recipients in the plaintext , as mentioned above , will make it possible for recipients of a redistributed message to be aware of its original nature . Naturally , the security of the cryptography can never be greater than the security of the people using it .

( No offense , > Gordon ) . I would n't give baserunning that much value . The above effect is clear , but there are other effects as well . If Olerud hits a double , any runner on first will score ; if Alomar legs an extra base onto a hit in the gap , the runner on first may need to hold at third . Thus Olerud 's doubles have more advancement value than Alomar 's . ( Of course , Alomar is more likely to score after hitting a double . ) Another reason not to give too much extra value to baserunning is that the runs created formulas work for very fast and very slow teams . No team in the 1950 's ran much , but some teams certainly had faster players than others . Still , the current runs created formulas work just as well in the 1950 's for all teams . Bill James gives the 1955-1958 Senators as an example . They used Harmon Killebrew regularly as a pinch runner , and in 1957 , stole 13 bases with 38 times caught stealing .

If the Europeans had the will to do anything besides sponsoring peace conferences , they would have no problem putting any kind of weapon they wanted into Bosnia . I guess I would favor ending the embargo if the Congress would pass a law forbidding export of US military supplies to Yugoslavia , including via third parties . Until then the risks of the US being drawn into a more active role would be too great .

Both sides are certainly not equal in the eyes of the press . And that's about all we have to go on , is n't it ? And I wish you 'd quit hurling words like racist around .

Fortunately for the convenience of us believers , there is a class of questions that can never be reduced away by natural science . For example : why does the universe exist at all ? After all , the time-space world did n't have to exist . Why does *anything* exist ? And : is it possible for persons ( e.g . man ) to come into being out of a purely impersonal cosmos ? These questions which look at the real mysteries of life -- the creation of the world and of persons -- provide a permanent indicator that the meaning of life in the material world can only be found *outside* that world , in its Source . | > We are _just_ animals .

When you say that man is *only* an animal , I have to think that you are presenting an unprovable statement -- a dogma , if you will . And one the requires a kind of `` faith '' too . By taking such a hard line in your atheism , you may have stumbled into a religion of your own . But before you write off all Christianity as phony and shallow , I hope you 'll do a little research into its history and varieties , perhaps by reading Paul Johnson 's `` A History of Christianity '' . From your remarks , it seems that you have been exposed to certain types of Christian religion and not others . Even an atheist should have enough faith in Man to know that a movement of 2000 years has to have some depth , and be animated by some enduring values .

Not saying I know any more than the average salesguy , I 'll give your question a shot . The key issue that I bought my BJ-200 on was ink drying speed . You really have to try awful hard to get the BJ-200 ink to smear . The HP DeskJets need 10-15 seconds to completely dry . In both cases , however , do not get your pages wet . Unlike laser printers , the material on your pages is INK , not toner . But that should go without saying . My PC has very little memory ( only 2Meg RAM ) , so the BJ-200 takes a little while to print -- -- - but every application I use takes a while to run . Once the computer is solely printing , it purs like a kitten and puts pages out every 15-30 seconds , depending on how detailed your graphics are . The BJ-200 can do Windows soft fonts . I 'm assuming that the DeskJet can , or HP would n't sell many ... ... Size is another factor . The BJ-200 is much smaller , but the HP is built like a tank . I bet the BJ-200 would get damaged first . Finally , the print quality . I LOVE the BJ-200 's resolution . It looks like a good laser quality print . The HP 's I 've used ... ..they look like ink . Not as impressive . So , I chose the Canon . Any other opinions ?

I can definitily say that you can use an RLL as Master and IDE as slave , as I have just upgraded my machine with a 200Mb IDE ( And custom Controller Mdl CI-1010 Extended IDE Controller ) While maintaining my RLL 'd Wren as master Drive . The trick is the controller which supports up to 4 IDE Drives while coexisting with existing Controllers ( MFM , RLL , ESDI , SCSI ) . So according to the Documentation it should work with ESDI , and I can assure you it works with RLL . Bruce Powell email : bss_brucep @ vd.seqeb.gov.au

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 1 ) What is RIPEM ? RIPEM is a ( not yet complete , but useful ) implementation of Privacy Enhanced Mail ( PEM ) . RIPEM allows your electronic mail to have the four security facilities provided by PEM : disclosure protection ( optional ) , originator authenticity , message integrity measures , and non-repudiation of origin ( always ) . ( See : `` What is PEM ? '' ) RIPEM was written primarily by Mark Riordan < mrr @ scss3.cl.msu.edu > . Most of the code is in the public domain , except for the RSA routines , which are a library called RSAREF licensed from RSA Data Security Inc . The current version of RIPEM is 1.0.5 ; the current version of the Macintosh port of RIPEM is 0.7 . 2 ) How can I get RIPEM ? RIPEM uses the library of cryptographic routines RSAREF , which is considered munitions and thus is export-restricted from distribution to persons who are not citizens or permanent residents in the U.S or Canada without an export license . No such license has been obtained ( nor would one likely be granted unless the RSA key exchange were shortened to 512 bits and the symmetric cipher changed to something weaker than DES . There are some suggestions that this situation may change now that Clinton is in office . ) The author requests in the README file that this law not be violated : # Please do not export the cryptographic code in this distribution # outside of the USA or Canada . This is a personal request from me , # the author of RIPEM , and a condition of your use of RIPEM . Note that RSAREF is not in the public domain , and a license for it is included with the distribution . You should read it before using RIPEM . RIPEM is available via anonymous FTP to citizens and permanent residents in the U.S. from rsa.com ; cd to rsaref/ and read the README file for info . Note that the non-RSAREF portion of RIPEM is not a product of RSA Data Security , Incorporated ; they merely are helping distribute it . RIPEM , as well as some other crypt stuff , has its `` home site '' on ripem.msu.edu , which is open to non-anonymous FTP for users in the U.S. and Canada who are citizens or permanent residents . To find out how to obtain access , FTP there , cd to pub/crypt/ , and read the file GETTING_ACCESS . For convenience , binaries for many architectures are available here in addition to the full source tree . 3 ) Will RIPEM run on my machine ? Probably . It has already been ported to MS-DOS and most flavors of Unix ( SunOS , NeXT , Linux , AIX , ULTRIX , Solaris , etc . ) Ports to Macintosh include a standard UNIX-style port and a rather nice Mac-like port written by Raymond Lau , author of StuffIt . More ports are expected , and help of users is invited . 4 ) Will RIPEM work with my mailer ? Probably . How easy and clean the effective interface is will depend on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer , though . The users guide , included with the distribution , discusses ways to use RIPEM with many popular mailers , including Berkeley , mush , Elm , and MH . Code is also included in elisp to allow easy use of RIPEM inside GNU Emacs . If you make a new interface for RIPEM or create an improvement on one in the distribution which you believe is convenient to use , secure , and may be useful to others , feel free to post it to alt.security.ripem . 5 ) What is RSA ? RSA is a crypto system which is asymmetric , or public-key . This means that there are two different , related keys : one to encrypt and one to decrypt . Because one can not ( reasonably ) be derived from the other , you may publish your encryption , or public , key widely and keep your decryption , or private , key to yourself . Anyone can use your public key to encrypt a message , but only you hold the private key needed to decrypt it . Note that the `` message '' sent with RSA is normally just the DES key to the real plaintext . ( See `` What is DES ? '' ) Note that the above only provides for disclosure protection . For originator authenticity , message integrity , and non-repudiation of origin services to be implemented , the fingerprint of the message ( See `` What is a fingerprint , like MD5 ? '' ) is encrypted with the sender 's private key . The recipient , or a dispute-resolving authority , can use the sender 's public key to decrypt it and confirm that the message must have come from the sender and was not altered . RSA was named for the three men ( Rivest , Shamir and Adleman ) who invented it . To find out lots more about RSA and modern cryptography in general , ftp to rsa.com and look in pub/faq/ . Some information also may be in sci.crypt . 6 ) What is DES ? DES is the Data Encryption Standard , a widely used symmetric , or secret-key , crypto system . Unlike RSA , DES uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt messages . However , DES is much faster than RSA . RIPEM uses both DES and RSA ; it generates a random key and encrypts your mail with DES using that key . It then encrypts that key with the recipient 's public RSA key and includes the result in the letter , allowing the recipient to recover the DES key . DES is sometimes considered weak because it is somewhat old and uses a key length considered too short by modern standards . However , it should be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large corporation or government agency . It is not likely that the PEM standard will incorporate support for other symmetric ciphers in the near future , because there is a strong feeling that PEM should be stable so it can become utilized widely without early problems with interoperability . 7 ) What is a fingerprint , like MD5 ? MD5 is a message digest algorithm produced by RSA Data Security Inc . It provides a 128-bit fingerprint , or cryptographically secure hash , of the plaintext . It is cryptographically secure because it is not possible ( in a reasonable amount of computation ) to produce a different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint . Thus , instead of signing the entire message with the sender 's private key , only the MD5 of the message needs to be signed for authentication . MD5s can also be exchanged directly for authentication ; for example , RIPEM public keys include an MD5 of the public key in the file , so parties wishing to confirm their keys are authentic via a separate channel merely need exchange MD5s of keys and verify their accuracy . MD5 is sometimes used for other purposes ; for example , it is often used to map an input of arbitrary length to 128 bits of data , as a passphrase interpreter or cookie generator . MD5 is described in its entirety ( including an implementation in C ) in RFC 1321 . There have been some recent suggestions that MD5 may not be as strong a hash as was originally believed ; presumably some other hash function will be used if this is accepted as true . 8 ) What is PEM ? PEM is Privacy Enhanced Mail , a standard for allowing transfer of encrypted electronic mail generated over a long period of time by a working group of experts . It is described in RFCs 1421-1424 ; these documents have been approved and obsolete the old RFCs 1113-1115 . RIPEM is not really a complete implementation of PEM , because PEM specifies certificates for authenticating keys , which RIPEM does not handle at this time . Their addition is planned . 9 ) What 's this about distributing and authenticating keys ? For a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you , she must know your public key . For you to be able to confirm that the message received came from her , you must know her public key . It is important that this information be accurate ; if a `` bad guy '' convinces her that his key is in fact yours , she will send messages which he can read . RIPEM allows for three methods of key management : a central server , the distributed finger servers , and a flat file . All three are described in the RIPEM users guide which is part of the distribution . None of them provide perfect security . The PEM standard calls for key management by certificates ; the addition of this feature to RIPEM is planned , but chicken-egg issues still exist . 10 ) Is n't it a bad idea to use patented algorithms in standards like PEM ? This issue has been considered in the standards process . RFC 1310 , the specification for Internet standards , has a discussion ( section 6 ) on what specifications for nondiscriminatory availability must be met for a patented method to be included in a standard . RFC 1421 addresses this issue with regard to the patents covering public-key cryptography . This does not , of course , mean that all questions are settled or that everyone is in agreement . An interesting exchange on the use of patented algorithms in standards with regard to public-key cryptography is in the League for Programming Freedom archive ( available via FTP : ftp.uu.net : /doc/lpf ) in the files bidzos.letter and bidzos.response . ( Amusingly , the LPF files on ftp.uu.net are compressed with a patented algorithm . ) 11 ) What about RSADSI/PKP ? RSA Data Security , Inc. ( RSADSI ) is a California-based company specializing in cryptographic technologies . Public Key Partners is a firm which holds exclusive sub-licensing rights of the following U.S. patents and all of their corresponding foreign patents : Cryptographic Apparatus and Method ( `` Diffie-Hellman '' ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... . No . 4,200,770 Public Key Cryptographic Apparatus and Method ( `` Hellman-Merkle '' ) ... ... ... ... ... ... .. No . 4,218,582 Cryptographic Communications System and Method ( `` RSA '' ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .. No . 4,405,829 Exponential Cryptographic Apparatus and Method ( `` Hellman-Pohlig '' ) ... ... ... ... ... ... .. No . 4,424,414 PKP claims these four patents cover all known methods of public key cryptography . The two businesses are rather closely related ( for example , the same person , Jim Bidzos , is president of both of them . ) PKP has licensed this technology to a considerable number of companies ( IBM , DEC , Motorola , AT & T , Lotus ... ) for use in their products . PKP has also threatened and filed lawsuits defending their patents . RIPEM was originally created with no connection to RSADSI other than its use of the RSAREF library , and for no reason other than its author 's desire to see widespread use of public-key cryptography . However , after the ball started rolling , people at RSADSI got interested . RSADSI decided to carry RIPEM on its FTP site , and some people there started making their own RIPEM keys and contributing code . RIPEM even won the `` Best Application Built on RSAREF in 1992 '' award . 12 ) Why do all RIPEM public keys look very similar ? RIPEM public keys begin with a PKCS ( Public-Key Cryptography Standards ) identifier describing various characteristics about the key , so the first bunch of characters in your key may be the same as those of lots of other people 's keys . This does not mean your keys are similar , but only that they are the same class of key , were generated with the same program , are of the same length , etc . 13 ) What is PGP ? PGP is another cryptographic mail program called Pretty Good Privacy . PGP has been around longer than RIPEM , and works somewhat differently . PGP is not compatible with RIPEM in any way , though PGP does also use RSA . A few major differences between PGP and RIPEM : - PGP has more key management features , particularly for users without a direct network connection . - RIPEM conforms to the PEM RFCs and thus has a greater probability of working with other PEM software . PGP makes no attempt to be compatible with anything other than itself . - RIPEM uses RSAREF , a library of RSA routines from RSADSI which comes with a license allowing noncommercial use . PGP uses its own implementation of RSA . PKP claims that it is a violation of its patents to `` make , use or sell '' PGP in the U.S. or Canada without either a license or written permission . ( See : `` DISCLAIMER '' ) ( See : `` What about RSADSI/PKP ? '' ) Phil Zimmermann , the author of PGP , stopped distributing it after being threatened with legal action ; he believed that a licensing scheme could be arranged , but it has n't happened and there seems little prospect of it happening in the future . He acknowledges in the PGP User 's Guide : # In fact , if you live in the USA , and you are not a Federal agency , # you should n't actually run PGP on your computer , because Public # Key Partners wants to forbid you from running my software . PGP is # contraband . - Both PGP and RIPEM are export-restricted , and can not be sent outside the U.S. and Canada without an export license . However , PGP already exists on many ftp sites in Europe and other places . Whether you use PGP or RIPEM or whatever , the documentation to PGP is recommended reading to anyone interested in such issues . Unfortunately , it 's not distributed separately from the program , which can be difficult to find in the U.S. on FTP sites due to liability concerns . 14 ) What about RPEM ? RPEM stands for Rabin Privacy Enhanced Mail . It was similar to RIPEM , but used a public-key cipher invented by Rabin ( which is not RSA ) in an attempt to avoid the patents on public-key systems . It was written by Mark Riordan , who later wrote RIPEM . Its distribution was halted when , contrary to the beliefs of many ( including Rabin ) , PKP claimed that their patents were broad enough to cover the cipher employed . This claim is not universally accepted , but was not challenged for pragmatic reasons . RPEM is not really used anymore . It is not compatible with RIPEM or PGP . 15 ) What is MIME ? MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions , and is described in RFC 1341 . You can find out about it in the newsgroup comp.mail.mime ; a FAQ exists on it . How PEM should interact with MIME is not yet entirely clear ; some people use the stopgap solution of having a MIME type application/x-ripem in order to send RIPEM messages as MIME ones . I hope some standards will emerge . Draft Internet documents exist on the matter . 16 ) What is TIS/PEM ? Trusted Information Systems is working on a version of Privacy Enhanced Mail for general availability . Last I heard , it was rumored to be integrated into an existing mail user agent ( MH ) rather than a stand-alone system , and in beta test . I do n't know much more than that . 17 ) I have this simple way to defeat the security of RIPEM ... You may wish to check the companion post `` ripem-attacks '' which discusses some of the more obvious attacks on RIPEM 's security and what procedures will minimize the risk . RIPEM 's main `` weak area '' is probably key distribution .

In paraphrase : On what or whose authority do Christians proclaim that they are above the Law and above the Prophets ( 7 major and 12 minor ) and not accountable to the Ten Commandments of which Jesus clearly spoke His opinion in Matthew 5:14-19 ? What is the source of this pseudo-doctrine ? Who is the pseudo-teacher ? Who is the Great Deceiver ?

Terry , I recently bought an LCIII and a Datadesk 101E . I don't remember trying to rebuild the desktop with it , however it did give me a strange problem . When I held down shift during startup to disable all extensions , nothing happened . I tried it with another keyboard , using the same adb connector cable- and it worked with the other keyboard . The shift key on the Datadesk keyboard worked well otherwise . I checked the dipswitches and they are fine . Try disabling your extensions and tell me if it works . I am annoyed with Datadesk . I sent them the keyboard in the mail for inspection/repair/replacement . The technician on the phone said they have a 10-14 day turn around time- meaning you should receive the inspected/repaired keyboard in that time . Well , they have had the keyboard for over 3 weeks and I still have gotten very little info from them about it . It 's annoying because it cost me $ 12 to send them the keyboard and their technical support line is not toll free . tell me if you have a similar experience with them . -David Mirsky mirsky @ gnu.ai.mit.edu

There are > surely some idiots who do smuggle guns , but Paul seems to feel that the exis- > tence of stricter gun control laws has had a deterrent effect . This seems a strange argument to make considering that Canada's violent crime rate in general is far lower than that of the U.S. ( Our non-gun crime rate is greater than their *entire* crime rate ) . It would seem strange to suggest that it , to , were the result of gun control laws . I think if we looked we 'd find very specific ( cultural and enforcement ) reasons why the non-gun rate is low as well , and then that reasons could be applied to the with-gun rates as easily . > Given that most > criminally used guns are either legally purchased or stolen from those who > purchase them legally , having more restrictions on legal possession does > seem to have the effect of reducing gun-related crimes . Aside from the fact that I find the idea of being punished because somebody might steal something from me and go and commit a crime with it a silly solution , it still does n't address the question of Canada . ( Which is now , by the way , blaming their rising gun-crime rate on the U.S . Strange that the border used to `` magically '' keep the guns out , but now is n't . ) > It certainly makes > sense that it would . ( Well , it makes sense to some of us , anyway . ; - ) The other side of the coin , of course , is that far `` illegal drugs '' are purchases legally or stolen from people who purchase them legally . I 've still not been convinced that guns , a commodity which criminals have shown their perfectly willing to pay for from illegal sources ( stolen either from police , military , or civilian ) we would n't simply see South American sources from which drugs come start smuggling guns as well , since there 's a thriving gun manufacturing industry down there . > > If you would just look a little closer at the crime statistics , you would > > realize that : > > -our non-gun crime rate is also very high , so guns per se are not the issue > > Directly contradicted by the NEJM study that compared crime in Seattle and > Vancouver , B.C . The non-gun rates were roughly the same for both cities . The > difference in violent crime rates was almost totally gun-related . And as was not pointed out in the study , but in critiques of it , ( two seperate articles by James Wright and David Kopel come to mind ) it was pointed out that the difference was *also* almost entirely minority related . That is , the gun crime rate skyrocketed for poor minorities ( Blacks and Hispanics primarily ) while when you compared the white majority they were virutally identical . The problem with the NEJM study was they compared minority vs. non-minority percentages but failed to take into account the relative conditions of those minorities . That there was an eqaul percentage of nomn-whites was about as far as they went . They failed to take into account that the non-whites in either city were not living in the same conditions . If the situation was entirely based on availability of guns , then we 'd expect that the white rates , the two groups which are arguably fairly comparative in the two cities , would have a far higher rate in Seattle . Yet the majority in Seattle is not only not significantly higher when the minorities are excluded , but slightly lower . > > -violent crime is highly concentrated in the inner city > > Surprise . Pick the area with the highest incidence of poverty , drug use , disease , > etc . Since rates are lower in suburbia , us middle class folks can ignore the > problem . The point is , of course , that many of the U.S. `` inner-city '' problems are not mirrored in Canada . As such if there is a condition which is significantly different in Canada from the U.S. , and violent crime is highly correlated to that area , suggesting that gun control is the source of Canada 's low rate is highly questionable . ( As one Canadian pointed out on talk.politics.guns , Canada 's major gun control in 1978 did not result in either a reduction or a slowing of an increase in violent crime rates , which have been rising steadily since . Apparently they did n't even mirror the U.S.s very large drop of violent crime in the early eighties . > > -most violent crime occurs in areas with strict gun control already > > Post hoc ergo propter hoc . Those areas implemented gun control because of > the high rates . True only to a certain extent . Take Washington D.C. , where gun control was instituted while it had crime problems true , but that crime proceeded to explode afterwards . Similarly for New York . The question is not simply a point in time where crime was high or low . Did the gun control significantly and positively impact violent crime . Since it 's gone up in those areas , often faster than it was going up before , you ca n't simply dismiss the high crime rate by saying gun control was caused by it . Yes , gun control may be instituted to deal with high crime . But if the crime is not positively impacted , you ca n't continually say that that crime rate was entirely a cause of that gun control , since much of that crime rate increased after gun control was implemented , just as happened in Canada . > Similar or worse rates exist in cities with poor gun control . As would be expected if violent crime was generally independent of gun control . > And the jury is still out on the question of whether recent tough laws in > Washington D.C. may have alleviated violence and suicide rates there . Would this be the laws which made manufacturers liable for what others did with their guns , and suddenly the police found nobody would sell to them ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- David Veal Univ . of Tenn.

Reply-To : petrack @ vnet.IBM.COM Disclaimer : This posting may contain no views at all News-Software : Usenet 3.1 Lines : 45 I have tried almost everything under the sun to get a null modem connection between a Mac Duo 210 and a PC . I have used MacKermit and VersaTerm on the Mac side . I have used Procomm , Kermit , and Softerm ( on OS/2 ) on the PC ( or PS ) side . I have used non-Hardware handshaking and hardware ahdshaking cables . And know MY hands are shaking from the effort . Nothing has allowed file transfers from the Mac to the PS . In general , I can type back and forth with no trouble , but only if both sides are set to speeds OVER 9600 baud . I can not send files from the Mac to the PS at all , and file transfers from the Duo to the PS are not possible . When I do a straight ascii send , I can send from the PS to the Duo flawlessly . I can send Binhex files this way quite fast , and I know that the transmission is error free . But straight ascii sent from the Mac to the PS is full of errors . Unless , of course , I do text pacing so slow that it is like human typing . ( well , like 2-3 times faster than human typing ) . I would like to hear from ANYONE who has been able to transfer files from a Duo 210 to a PS via modem or null modem . If you can do it , please tell me your EXACT combination of hardware and software . Obviously , I am talking of a true serial port modem , not the express modem . Maybe some kind soul with access to a modem and a Duo 210 can check this out for me . Right now , I am of the opinion that it wo n't work at high speeds because of the power interrupts on the Duo , and it wo n't work at low speeds because of some crazy reason I do n't understand . Could I hear from someone attesting that they can really pump information out the serial port of a Duo 210 fast ? Like via a modem or via a sys-ex dump ? Could anyone with a Duo help me out ? ? I am going absolutely INSANE . I wan na know if the problem is MY Duo , or all Duo 210s , or all Duos , or just me . Yes , I have checked the cable 1,000,000 times . And not only can I type back and forth , but Zterm alerts the users if s/he uses hardware handshaking and CTS is down . So I know that hardware handshaking is working . And also , According to Zterm port stats , the buffer never overflows . Please help me figure out what 's going on ... Scott Petrack Petrack @ haifasc3.vnet.ibm.com

How will the normal average fan be able to count how many fouls a player has ? And then we would even have to remember the names of the players , in order to determine who drew the foul ! And , of course , there will have to be new `` sub-positions '' , like the power center who just sits in the slot until the ( blue , of course ) puck comes near him , and the `` shooting defenseman '' and the `` point defenseman '' . Finally , we'll be able to keep stats on the best and the worst penalty-shot takers .

Be sure a dietician is up to date on Crohn 's and Ulcerative Colitis . Previously , low residue diets were recommended , but this advice has now changed . Also , there will be differences in advice in patients with and without obstructuon remaining , so input by the physician will be important . I find the dietician very important in my practice , and I send most of my patients to a dietician in the course of seeing them , since dieticians know so much better how to get diet histories and evaluate the contents of a diet than I do .

If you 're considering such a system , here are the pros and cons : For the educational environment , this system is excellent . We use it to produce a variety of educational materials for disemination on our local network . Because this programming is going to be viewed on other Macs , the image quality is not as important as the ability to directly export the video to the Net . We also use it to produce orientiation and promotional video programs for use by the Lewis & Clark community . Since these programs are not meant for commercial or broadcast use , image quality is not critical . The Digital Film system , for those of you who are uninitiated , is an A/B roll digitizing system on one $ 5000 JPEG compression card . It was promoted as an inexpensive online editing system with SVHS quality . SuperMac , the maker of the card , is trying to achieve this quality level , but as yet , has been unable to deliver . Our system produces `` near VHS '' quality at 30 fields per second ( 640x480 overscan ) . The card repeats every other field to get 60 fields per second . This results in a kind of Super 8 film look that some find distracting . If you can get past this problem , you 'll find the Adobe Premier editing software quite enjoyable with which to work . It produces thousands of different effects from crystalize filters to DVE transitions to color matting . Because of its non-linear nature , editing is fast and easy . If you 've ever used ( or seen used ) an AVID or Montage system , you 'll recognize the methodology and the user interface . The total system with Quadra 950 ( 40Megs of RAM ) , 1 gig drive , 21 '' Apple mon- itor , Panasonic SVHS 1960 edit deck , audio gear ( cassette , CD , EQ , mixer , etc ) , Composite monitor , Digital Film card will set you back about $ 20,000 . For you video cowboys and girls , this system will not output at a quality that will satisfy most of your clients . Even though you can perform more effects than a toasterhead can imagine , an Amiga based off-line based system will look better . We use both Macs and Amigas for our video work .

I do n't meant to defend Eric Molas- I find it somewhat annoying when someone pops up on alt.atheism to tell us all about his ( usually atheistic ) beliefs , so I can certainly see how Christians might be annoyed- but I 'd like to point out a few things . > I am glad that I am not an atheist . It seems tragic that some people > choose a meaningless existence . `` no meaning from God '' is not the same as `` no meaning '' . From my ( atheistic ) point of view , if you want meaning in your life , you get to go and get some or make some . No free gifts of meaning . ( I never quite understood how any God can just `` give '' your life meaning , actually . If he says you exists to do or be X , that gives you a purpose if you care to accept it , but is that the same thing ? But I digress ... ) > How terrible to go on living only > because one fears death more than life . This would truely be a miserably existance , which I doubt Eric endures . Life can be enjoyable , so you can live it because you like it , or purposefull , so you can live it to get something done . One should endeavour to make it so , if it is not . Otherwise it would be as you say . Terrible . > I feel so sorry for Eric and > yet any attempts to share my joy in life with him would be considered as > further evidence of the infectious nature of Christianity . Probably true . Remeber he almost certainly sees that particular joy as an illusion , and does not want it . So maybe it is n't so bad ? > As a Christian I am free to be a human person . I think , love , choose , > and create . As an atheist , I am free to be a human person . I think , love , choose , and create . > I will live forever with God . Ah , now here we begin to diverge . I will not live forever with anyone . ( I do n't think you will either , but you are welcome to your opinion on the matter . ) > Christ is not a kind of drug . I tend to agree with you . It 's my opinion that ( unlike drugs ) religions are normal parts of human societies .

As much as fans want to catch a ball , they really should be aware that winning the game is more important . As a Dodger fan , he has to be aware that this is the home stadium , and that entails helping the home team win in any way possible . As soon as the ball was hit that far , his first instinct should be to root for Darryl to catch it , not to try to catch it himself , particularly when he is sitting that close . I enjoy the attitude of the Wrigley fans , where they are against visiting team home runs so much , they actually throw them back on the field . Now , this has nothing to do with whether Darryl could have caught it or not . Sure , he probably screwed up , but the fan should realize his first responsibility is to get out of the way and help the team win . Daniel daniel @ caldera.usc.edu

Would you not > show up for services if they were called `` Resurrection Sunday Services '' > rather than `` Easter Services '' ? There is another way to view this . The True Celebration is Easter , the Resurrection of Our Lord . This has been true from the foundation of the world . Pagan practices are then either : 1. foreshadowings of the True Celebration of the Resurrection , in which dim light was shone forth so that people would recognize the full truth when it was manifested , OR 2. satanic counterfeits intended to deceive us so that we would not recognize the truth when it was manifested . I do n't believe the second argument , because I believe in the power of the Resurrection , the fulfillment of the Incarnation , and our hope . Earlier or parallel ideas in other religions clearly are dim images of the truth of the Resurrection . As Paul states , we see through a glass darkly . So do others . It serves no purpose arguing about who has the darker or lighter glass . The foreshadowings are not perfect . So what ? Our understnding of God is today imperfect , for we are not yet perfected . Theosis is not a gift such that WHAM , we 're perfect .

Typos , syntax , etc . are problems . It can be a good learning experience for someone who is studying C. There is also a companion disk with source available for order and $ 50.00 .

First of all , the original poster misquoted . The reference is from 2 Tim 3:16 . The author was Paul , and his revelations were anything but `` ( at best ) second-hand '' . `` And is came about that as [ Saul ] journeyed , he was approaching Damascus , and suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him ; and he fell to the ground , and heard a voice saying to him , `` Saul , Saul , why are you persecuting Me ? '' And he said , `` Who art Thou , Lord ? '' And He said , `` I am Jesus whom you are persecuting , . . . '' ( Acts 9:3-5 , NAS ) Paul received revelation directly from the risen Jesus ! ( Pretty cool , eh ? ) He became closely involved with the early church , the leaders of which were followers of Jesus throughout his ministry on earth . > Now , you may say , `` The Holy Spirit revealed these things > unto him , '' and we could go into that argument , but > you 'd be hard-pressed to convince me that the Holy > Spirit exists . I agree . I do n't believe anyone but the Spirit would be able to convince you the Spirit exists . Please do n't complain about this being circular . I know it is , but really , can anything of the natural world explain the supernatural ? ( This is why revelation is necessary to the authors of the Bible . ) > Additionally , what he has written is > again second-hand info if it were given by the Spirit , > and still carries the chance it is not true . The Spirit is part of God . How much closer to the source can you get ? The Greek in 2 Timothy which is sometimes translated as `` inspired by God '' , literally means `` God-breathed '' . In other words , God spoke the actual words into the scriptures . Many theologians and Bible scholars ( Dr. James Boice is one that I can remember off-hand ) get quite annoyed by the dryness and incompleteness of `` inspired by God '' . > The only way you would be able to escape this notion of > `` second-hand '' info is to have had the entire Bible > written by God himself . And to tell the truth , I've > studied the Bible extensively , and have yet to > hear of scholars who have put forth objective evidence > showing God as the first author of this collection of > books . That 's what the verse taken from 2 Timothy was all about .

Please rethink this last paragraph . If there is no God , which seems to be your current belief , then Jesus was either a liar or a complete nut because not only did he assert that God exists , but he claimed to be God himself ! ( regards to C.S . Lewis ) How then could you have the least bit of respect for Jesus ? In conclusion , be careful about logically unfounded hypotheses based on gut feelings about the text and other scholars ' unsubstantiated claims . The Bible pleads that we take it in its entirety or throw the whole book out . About your reading of the Bible , not only does the Spirit inspire the writers , but he guides the reader as well . We can not understand it in the least without the Spirit 's guidance : '' For to us God revealed them through the Spirit ; for the Spirit searches all things , even the depths of God .

From : rws @ cs.arizona.edu ( Ronald W. Schmidt ) Subject : outlining of spline surface Keywords : spline rasterization Lines : 38 About a year ago I started work on a problem that appeared to be very simple and turned out to be quite difficult . I am wondering if anyone on the net has seen this problem and ( hopefully ) some published solutions to it . The problem is to draw an outline of a surface defined by two roughly parallel cubic splines . For inputs the problem essentially starts with two sets of points where each set of points is on the edge of an object which we treat as two dimensional , i.e . only extant between the edges , but which exists in three dimensional space . To draw the object we 1 ) fit a cubic spline through the points . Each spline is effectively computed as a sequence of line segments approximating the curve . Each spline has an equal number of segments . We assume that the nth segment along each spline is roughly , but not exactly , the same distance along each spline by any reasonable measure . 2 ) Take each segment ( n ) along each spline and match it to the nth segment of the opposing spline . Use the pair of segments to form two triangles which will be filled in to color the surface . 3 ) Depth sort the triangles 4 ) Take each triangle in sorted order , project onto a 2D pixmap , draw and color the triangle . Take the edge of the triangle that is along the edge of the surface and draw a line along that edge colored with a special `` edge color '' It is the edge coloring in step 4 that is at the heart of the problem . The idea is to effectively outline the edge of the surface . The net result however generally has lots of breaks and gaps in the edge of the surface . The reasons for this are fairly complicated . They involve both rasterization problems and problems resulting from the projecting the splines . If anything about this problem sounds familiar we would appreciate knowing about other work in this area . -Thanks

I seem to recall incidents in the past where Chinese entreprenaurs attempted to smuggle AK-47s ( semi-autos ) into this country to get around import number limitations ( May have been Gunweek where I read that years ago ... ) Any person with high-school drafting skills and vocational school machineshop training could produce a submachinegun . You talk about the average person not being able get even a zip-gun ; well now , think of all that private CNC controlled machinery that is not being used for 3 shifts a day ; do you think that if guns were being sold on the black market for say , $ 150 , an enterprising mechanical engineer could be using that machinery to produce workable submachineguns for sale ? After all , GUNWEEK had an article and pictures on how BATF was looking for the manufacturer of quite efficient silencers that were of commercial quality and finish . Look at it this way , 25 % of the U.S. households have a handgun . Say at least half of those keep one for self-defense . You are talking a potential market of of tens of millions of people who would seek firearms for the purpose of self-preservation .

As usual , you are missing the whole point , Russell , because you are not willing to even consider questionning your basic article of faith , which is that science is merely a matter of methodology and that the highest purpose of science is to avoid making mistakes . This is like saying that the most important aspect of business management is accurate bookkeeping . If science were no more than methodology and not making mistakes , it would be a poor thing indeed . What was the methodology of Darwin ? What was the methodology of Einstein ? What was , for that matter , the methodology of Jenner and Pasteur ? In an earlier article , Russell Turpin writes : > None of the foregoing should be read as meaning that we should > open the door to practitioners of quackery and psuedo-science . > Modern advocates of homeopathy , chiropracty , and traditional > Chinese medicine receive little respect because , for the most > part , they use methods and reasoning that the kind of research > Lee Lady recommends has shown to be terribly faulty . ( This does > *not* imply that all their treatments are ineffective . It *does* > imply that those who rely on faulty methodology and reasoning are > incapable of discovering *which* treatments are effective and > which are not . ) First of all , I think you are arguing against a straw man , because I do n't think that anyone here is arguing that quackery , pseudo-science , homeopathy , chiropracty , and traditional Chinese medicine should be accepted as science . I , in particular , think the basic ideas of homeopathy and chiropracty seem extremely flaky . What some of us do believe , however , is that some of these things ( including some of the flaky ideas ) are deserving of serious scientific attention . If in fact it were true , as you have stated above , that those who do not use the currently fashionable methodology can have no idea what is effective and what is not , then science today would not exist . For all of current science is based on the past work of scientists whose methodology , by current standards , was seriously flawed . It is certainly true that as methodology improves , we need to re-examine those results derived in the past using less perfect methodologies . It is also true that the results obtained by people today who still rely on those early methodologies needs to be re-examined in a more rigorous fashion by those qualified to do so credibly . But to say that nobody who fails to do elaborate double-blind studies is capable of knowing their ass from a hole in the ground and to say that no ideas that come from outside the scientific establishment could possibly be worthy of serious investigation ... this truly marks one 's attitude as doctrinaire , cultist . This attitude is not compatible with a belief in reason . -- In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists , psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects . lady @ uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu lady @ uhunix.bitnet

A problem with this approach is that at the points of intersection the pixel locations belonging to the other rectangle also become white , which is something that should be avoided . Is there any way I can avoid this problem without having to redraw the other rectangle too ? I also would not like to generate an expose event for the affected area as this degrades performance very badly ... Thank you ... Gopal

Other things to watch out for/consider : The rates are $ 5 to $ 30 higher than UPS direct . For a non-UPS ( truck ) package , they quoted a rate of $ 85 . Fed Ex economy air was only $ 85 for the same weight ! RPS ( a trucking package company , in many cities ) only wanted $ 18 . Guess who got it . The Mailbox operator told me I was not telling the truth about competitors ' rates , said RPS was unreliable ( I 've used them before with NO problems ) , etc . Right . A COD check goes to the mailing service . Our local Mailbox then takes its sweet time mailing me the remade check . All this for an additional $ 3.00 over the UPS COD charge . What a deal ... . : - ) For packages over $ 100 , they charge you about double over what UPS charges them for insurance . I 've never had a claim , but other netters ( is Ralph Seguin out there ? ) have told horror stories about them ... All package traces have to be done through Mailbox by Mailbox .

IF you can remember to tuck properly , the bits that are going to take most punishment with the gear you have will probably be your feet , then hips and knees . Get boots then trousers . The gloves come last , as long as you 've the self control to pull your arms in when you tuck .

No , it 's not acceptable if it 's part of your login process . But if you are going to use network traffic as the source of pseudo-random information , do the right thing and pass it through a cryptographic hash function , not a compressor . Aside from the fact that it will run faster , it will give better results ( think of a cryptographic hash as a function that `` distills '' randomness ) . Something along the lines of etherfind -t -x -n | dd bs=1k count=10 2 > /dev/null | md5 should do the trick . -t gives you timestamps , and the lack of -u makes sure that dd does not get ten lines as opposed to ten K.

Have anyone heard about it or using it ? What is it 's performance ? Is it stable or not ? Please give me some advice . In addition , I heard a news from local distributor that a new 28800baud CCITT ROM ( the distributor said it will be the new CCITT standard . ) for this modem will be produced at the end of this year . After replaced the old ROM by this 28800 ROM , this Spirit II can transfer data at 28800baud without any hardware alternation . Is this new true and possible ? Would the telephone line really able to transfer at such high speed ? Please give me some advice . At last , can anyone tell me how to contact with the central dealer QuickComm . Inc. ? ( I am not sure whether it in U.S.A. or not . ) Please leave me a e-mail . Thank you very much . Leung ( from Hong Kong University )

X XABOUT THIS FILE : X X This file is intended to help people who wish to submit entries to X the International Obfuscated C Code Contest ( IOCCC for short ) . X X This is not the IOCCC rules , though it does contain comments about X them . The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions . X Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are X allowed . Even so , you are safer if you remain within the guidelines . X X You should read the current IOCCC rules , prior to submitting entries . X The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines . X X Changes from the 1993 draft are noted by change bars . -- - > | X X XWHAT IS NEW IN 1993 : X X The entry format is better ( for us anyway ) . The program mkentry.c X has been updated . See ENTRY FORMAT . X X We will reject entries that can not be compiled using an ANSI C X compiler . Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers X fits are no longer permitted . Some of the new issues deal with X non-integral array types , variable number of arguments , C preprocessor X directives and the exit ( ) function . See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES . X X XHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS : X X You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests . See X FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners . X X Keep in mind that rules change from year to year , so some winning entries X may not be valid entries this year . What was unique and novel one year X might be 'old ' the next year . X X An entry is usually examined in a number of ways . We typically apply X a number of tests to an entry : X X * look at the original source X * convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCII X * C pre-process the source ignoring ' # include ' lines X * C pre-process the source ignoring ' # define ' and ' # include ' lines X * run it through a C beautifier X * examine the algorithm X * lint it X * compile it X * execute it X X You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests . X You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been X 'cleaned up ' by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier . X X Your entry need not do well under all , or in most tests . In certain X cases , a test is not important . Entries that compete for the X 'strangest/most creative source layout ' need not do as well as X others in terms of their algorithm . On the other hand , given X two such entries , we are more inclined to pick the entry that X does something interesting when you run it . X X We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules . As such , we leave X the contest open for creative rule interpretation . As in real life X programming , interpreting a requirements document or a customer request X is important . For this reason , we often award 'worst abuse of the X rules ' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way . X X If you do plan to abuse the rules , we suggest that you let us know X in the remarks section . Please note that an invitation to abuse X is not an invitation to break . We are strict when it comes to the X 3217 byte size limit . Also , abusing the entry format tends to X annoy more than amuse . X X We do realize that there are holes in the rules , and invite entries X to attempt to exploit them . We will award 'worst abuse of the rules' X and then plug the hole next year . Even so , we will attempt to use X the smallest plug needed , if not smaller . : - ) X X Check out your program and be sure that it works . We sometimes make X the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem , particularly X in or near the final round . On the other hand , we have seen some X of the best entries fall down because they did n't work . X X We tend to look down on a prime number printer , that claims that X 16 is a prime number . If you do have a bug , you are better off X documenting it . Noting `` this entry sometimes prints the 4th power X of a prime by mistake '' would save the above entry . And sometimes , X a strange bug/feature can even help the entry ! Of course , a correctly X working entry is best . X X XOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES : X X Doing masses of # defines to obscure the source has become 'old ' . We X tend to 'see thru ' masses of # defines due to our pre-processor tests X that we apply . Simply abusing # defines or -Dfoo=bar wo n't go as far X as a program that is more well rounded in confusion . X X Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code , and so do we : X X # define d define X # d foo < -- do n't expect this to turn into # define foo X X int i ; X j ; < -- do n't use such implicit type declaration X int k ; X X We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler . If you X must use non-ANSI C , such as K & R C , you must avoid areas that result in X compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers . X X Unfortunately , some ANSI C compilers require array indexes to be of | X integral type . Thus , the following classical obfuscation hacks should | X not be used in 1993 . This rule may be relaxed in future contests . | X X int i ; X char *c ; X i [ c ] ; < -- - use c [ i ] instead X ( i+3 ) [ `` string '' ] ; < -- - use `` string '' [ i+3 ] instead X X If your entry uses functions that have a variable number of X arguments , be careful . Systems implement va_list as a wide variety X of ways . Because of this , a number of operations using va_list are X not portable and must not be used : X X * assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variable X * casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variable X * passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list arg X * passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list arg X * performing arithmetic on va_list variables X * using va_list as a structure or union X X In particular , do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char ** 's . X X Avoid using < varargs.h > , use < stdarg.h > instead . X X If you use C preprocessor directives ( # define , # if , # ifdef , ... ) , X the leading ' # ' must be the first character on a line . While some X C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading ' # ' , many do not . X X Because the exit ( ) function returns void on some systems , entries X must not assume that it returns an int . X X Small programs are best when they are short , obscure and concise . X While such programs are not as complex as other winners , they do X serve a useful purpose . They are often the only program that people X attempt to completely understand . For this reason , we look for X programs that are compact , and are instructional . X X One line programs should be short one line programs , say around 80 X bytes long . Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion . X X We tend to dislike programs that : X X * are very hardware specific X * are very OS or Un*x version specific X ( index/strchr differences are ok , but socket/streams specific X code is likely not to be ) X * dump core or have compiler warnings X ( it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark ' header item ) X * wo n't compile under both BSD or SYS V Un*x X * abusing the build file to get around the size limit X * obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphs X * are longer than they need to be X * are similar to previous winners X * are identical to previous losers : - ) X X Unless you are cramped for space , or unless you are entering the X 'best one liner ' category , we suggest that you format your program X in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines . X X The build file should not be used to try and get around the size X limit . It is one thing to make use of a several -D 's to help out , X but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -D 's in order to X try and squeeze the source under the size limit . You should feel X free to make use of the build file space , but you are better off X if you show some amount of restraint . X X We allowed whitespace , and in certain cases ; { or } do not impact X your program size ( up to a certain point ) , because we want to get X away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters . X X Given two versions of the same program , one that is a compact blob X of code , and the other that is formatted more like a typical C X program , we tend to favor the second version . Of course , a third X version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting X and/or obfuscated way , would definitely win over the first two ! X X We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating' X program . We are amazed at the many different sizes that claim X to be the smallest . There is nothing wrong with self-replicating X programs . In fact , a number of winners have been self-replicating . X You might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest ' , lest we ( or others ) X know of a smaller one ! X X X client entries should be as portable as possible . Entries that X adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored . Don't X depend on a particular type of display . For example , do n't depend X on color or a given size . Do n't require backing store . X X X client entries should avoid using X related libraries and X software that is not in wide spread use . We ask that such X client X entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and the X Athena widget set ( libX11.a , libXaw.a , libXmu.a and libXt.a ) . X Do n't use M*tif , Xv*ew , or OpenL*ok toolkits , since not everyone X has them . Avoid depending on a particular window manager . Not X everyone has X11r5 , and some people are stuck back in X11r4 ( or X earlier ) , so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5 . Better X yet , try to make your entry run on all version 11 X Window Systems . X X X client entries should not to depend on particular items on X .Xdefaults . If you must do so , be sure to note the required lines X in the -- -remark -- - section . X X We like programs that : X X * are as concise and small as they need to be X * do something at least quasi-interesting X * pass lint without complaint ( not a requirement , but it is nice ) X * are portable X * are unique or novel in their obfuscation style X * MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATION X * make us laugh and/or throw up : - ) X X Some types of programs ca n't excel in some areas . Of course , your X program does n't have to excel in all areas , but doing well in several X areas really does help . X X We freely admit that interesting , creative or humorous comments in X the -- -remark -- - section helps your chance of winning . If you had to X read of many twisted entries , you too would enjoy a good laugh or two . X We think the readers of the contest winners do as well . X X Be creative ! X X XENTRY FORMAT : X X In order to help us process the many entries , we must request your X assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way . This format , X in addition , allows us to quickly separate information about the X author from the program itself . ( see JUDGING PROCESS ) X X We have provided the program , mkentry , as an example of how to X format entries . You should be aware of the following warning that X is found in mkentry.c : X X This program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules . Every X attempt has been made to make sure that this program produces X an entry that conforms to the contest rules . In all cases , X where this program differs from the contest rules , the X contest rules will be used . Be sure to check with the X contest rules before submitting an entry . X X You are not required to use mkentry . It is convenient , however , X as it attempts to uuencode the needed files , and attempt to check X the entry against the size rules . X X If you have any suggestions , comments , fixes or complaints about X the mkentry.c program , please send Email to the judges . ( see below ) X X The following is a sample entry : X X -- -entry -- - Xrule : 1993 Xfix : n Xtitle : chonglab Xentry : 0 Xdate : Mon Mar 1 08:45:20 1993 Xhost : Un*x v6 , pdp11/45 X 2.9BSD , pdp11/70 X -- -remark -- - X This is a non-obfuscated obfuscated C program .

If an entry wins , we will rename X its source and binary to avoid filename collision . By tradition , X we use the name of the entry 's title , followed by an optional X digit in case of name conflicts . X X If the above entry somehow won the 'least likely to win ' award , X we would use chonglab.c and chonglab . X X If your entry depends on , or requires that your build , source X and/or binary files be a particular name , please say so in the X -- -remark -- - section . If this case applies , it would be be helpful X if you did one of the following : X X * Tell us how to change the filename ( s ) in your entry . X X * Have the build file make copies of the files . For example : X X cc prog.c -o special_name need special binary X X or rm -f special_src.c need special source X cp prog.c special_src.c X cc special_src.c -o special_name X X or rm -f special_build need special build X tail +4 build > special_build X sh < special_build X X * Assume that we will use the entry title . Send us a version of X your build/program files that uses the name convention . You X should uuencode these files in -- -data -- - sections . X X If your entry needs to modify its source , info or binary files , X please say so in the -- -remark -- - section . You should try to avoid X touching your original build , source and binary files . You should X arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify . This X will allow people to re-generate your entry from scratch . X X Remember that your entry may be built without a build file . We X typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile . If the X build file must exist , say so in the -- -remark -- - section . X X If your entry needs special info files , you should uuencode them X into -- -info -- - sections . In the case of multiple info files , X use multiple -- -info -- - sections . If no info files are needed , X then skip the -- -info -- - section . X X Info files are intended to be input , or detailed information that X does not fit well into the -- -remark -- - section . For example , an X entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample X programs for the user to compile . An entry might want to include a X lengthy design document , that might not be appropriate for a X 'hints ' file . X X Info files should be used only to supplement your entry . For X example , info files may provide sample input or detailed X information about your entry . Because they are supplemental , X the entry should not require them exist . X X In some cases , your info files might be renamed to avoid name X conflicts . If info files should not be renamed for some reason , X say so in the -- -remark -- - section . X X Info files must uudecode into the current directory . If they X absolutely must be renamed , or moved into a sub-directory , say X so in the -- -remark -- - section . X X When submitting multiple entries , be sure that each entry has X a unique entry number from 0 to 7 . Your first entry should X have entry number 0 . X X With the exception of the header , all text outside of the entry X format may be ignored . That is , do n't place text outside of the X entry and expect the judges to see it . ( Our decoding tools aren't X AI progs ! ) If you need tell the the something , put it in the X -- -remark -- - section , or send a Email to the judges at : X X ... ! { apple , pyramid , sun , uunet } ! hoptoad ! judges ( not the address for X judges @ toad.com submitting entries ) X X The date should be given with respect to UTC . ( Some systems refer X to this as GMT or GMT0 ) The format of the date should be that as X returned by asctime ( ) in the C locale . An example of such a string is : X X Thr Apr 01 00:47:00 1993 X X This format is similar to the output of the date ( 1 ) command . The X string does not include the timezone name before the year . On many X systems , one of the following command will produce a similar string : X X date -u `` + % a % h % d % T 19 % y '' X date -u | sed -e 's/ ... \ ( 19 [ 0-9 ] [ 0-9 ] \ ) $ /\1/' X sh -c 'TZ=UTC date | sed -e `` s/ ... \ ( 19 [ 0-9 ] [ 0-9 ] \ ) $ /\1/ '' ' X sh -c 'TZ=GMT date | sed -e `` s/ ... \ ( 19 [ 0-9 ] [ 0-9 ] \ ) $ /\1/ '' ' X sh -c 'TZ=GMT0 date | sed -e `` s/ ... \ ( 19 [ 0-9 ] [ 0-9 ] \ ) $ /\1/ '' ' X X You are allowed to update/fix/revise your entry . To do so , set X the 'fix ' line in the -- -entry -- - section to ' y ' instead of ' n ' . X Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number X as well , as these are used to determine which entry is to be X replaced . X X XJUDGING PROCESS : X X Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll . X X Entries are unpacked into individual directories . The Email message X is unpacked into individual files , each containing : X X -- -entry -- - section X all -- -author -- - sections X all -- -info -- - sections X -- -build -- - section X -- -program -- - section X any other text , including the Email message headers X X Prior to judging , the 'any other text ' file is scanned to be sure X it does not contain useful information ( or in case the entry was X malformed and did not unpack correctly ) . Information from the X -- -author -- - sections are not read until the judging process is X complete , and then only from entries that have won an award . X X The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular X individual . We are usually kept in the dark as much as you are X until the final awards are given . We like the surprise of finding X out in the end , who won and where they were from . X X We attempt to keep all entries anonymous , unless they win an award . X Because the main 'prize ' of winning is being announced , we make all X attempts to send non-winners into oblivion . We remove all non-winning X files , and shred all related paper . By tradition , we do not even X reveal the number of entries that we received . ( for the curious , X we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCC X winners at talks ) X X After the Usenix announcement , we attempt to send Email to the X authors of the winning entries . One reason we do this is to give X the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their X entry . They are given the chance to correct mistakes , typos . We X often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well . X This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world . X X Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds . During a round , X the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles ; X the pile that advances on to the next round , and the pile that does X not . We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in the X previous round . Thus , an entry gets at least two readings . X X A reading consists of a number of actions : X X * reading the -- -entry -- - section X * reading the uudecoded -- -build -- - section X * reading the uudecoded -- -program -- - section X * reading the uudecoded -- -info -- - section ( s ) , if any X * passing the source thru the C pre-processor X shipping over any # include files X * performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the source X * passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processor X shipping over any # include files X X In later rounds , other actions are performed : X X * linting the source X * compiling/building the source X * running the program X * performing misc tests on the source and binary X X Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries , entries X are judged on an individual basis . An entry is set aside because it X does not , in our opinion , meet the standard established by the round . X When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries , we begin to form X award categories . Entries begin to compete with each other for awards . X An entry often will compete in several categories . X X The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries X we receive . A typical category list might be : X X * best small one line program X * best small program X * strangest/most creative source layout X * most useful obfuscated program X * best game that is obfuscated X * most creatively obfuscated program X * most deceptive C code X * best X client ( see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES ) X * best abuse of ANSI C X * worst abuse of the rules X * < anything else so strange that it deserves an award > X X We do not limit ourselves to this list . For example , a few entries are so X good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round . X We will invent awards categories for them , if necessary . X X In the final round process , we perform the difficult tasks of X reducing the remaining entries ( typically about 25 ) down to 8 or 10 X winners . Often we are confident that the entries that make it into X the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not X make it . The selection of the winners out of the final round , is X less clear cut . X X Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win , but is beat out X by a similar , but slightly better entry . For this reason , it is X sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry X that failed to win in a previous year . This assumes , of course , X that the entry is worth improving in the first place ! X X More often that not , we select a small entry ( usually one line ) , a X strange/creative layout entry , and an entry that abuses the contest X rules in some way . X X In the end , we traditionally pick one entry as 'best ' . Sometimes such X an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry . More often , the X 'best ' is picked because it does well in a number of categories . X X XANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS : X X The first announcement , occurs at a Summer Usenix conference . By tradition , X this is done during the latter part of the UUNET/IOCCC BOF , just prior to X the Berkeley BSD , and BSDI BOF . X X Winning entries will be posted in late June to the following groups : X X comp.lang.c comp.unix.wizards alt.sources X X In addition , pointers to these postings are posted to the following X X comp.sources.d alt.sources.d misc.misc X comp.sources.misc comp.windows.x X X Winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives . See X below for details . X X Often , winning entries are published in selected magazines . Winners X have appeared in books ( `` The New Hackers Dictionary '' ) and on T-Shirts . X X Last , but not least , winners receive international fame and flames ! : - ) X X XFOR MORE INFORMATION : X X You may contact the judges by sending Email to the following address : X X ... ! { apple , pyramid , sun , uunet } ! hoptoad ! judges ( not the address for X judges @ toad.com submitting entries ) X X Questions and comments about the contest are welcome .

From : JEK @ cu.nih.gov Subject : about Eliz C Prophet Lines : 21 Rob Butera asks about a book called THE LOST YEARS OF JESUS , by Elizabeth Clare Prophet . I do not know the book . However , Miss Prophet is the leader of a group ( The Church Universal and Triumphant ) derived from the I AM group founded by a Mr. Ballard who began his mission in the 1930's ( I am writing this from memory and may not have all the details straight -- for an old account , check your library for a bnook by Marcus Bach ) after an eighteenth-century Frenchman appeared , tapped him on the shoulder , and offered him a cup of `` cosmic essence . '' A major tenet of the movement is that there is a monastery in the mountains of Tibet from which a monk descends to the lower altitudes every few centuries to preach , and that all major religions have been founded by monks from this monastery . Typically , the Ballard family and their successors , the Prophet family ( related by marriage , if I remember aright ) , base almost all their teachings on messages they have allegedly received by telepathy from Tibet . I should be surprised if the book you mention has any scholarly basis . Yours , James Kiefer

MITRE paranoia ? I could cite probably a hundred more facts which all support , as best hypothesis , the notion that the NSA is grabbing as much as it can , as fast as it can . One would be a fool to ignore the pattern of facts and conclude that they were random ... And we know the government is violent -- even against children as recent events prove .

I do n't have to `` try reading a bit '' , Pat . I *work* as a government contractor and know what the rules are like . Yes , they sign some ( damned few -- which is why everyone is always having to go to Washington to see about next week 's funding ) multi-year contracts ; they also are n't willing to include sufficient cancellation penalties when they *do* decide to cut the multi-year contract and not pay on it ( which can happen arbitrarily at any time , no matter what previous plans were ) to make the risk acceptable of something like putting up a private space station with the government as the expected prime occupant .

Exploiting my last name to discredit me on the issue is hitting below the belt . What I am interested in is the truth . Let me give you an excert from a recent FDA hearing : `` There is no evidence orally consumed glutamate has any effect on the brain , '' said Dr. Richard Wurtman of Massachusetts Institute of Technology . The anecdotal experiences of individuals is `` superstition , not science , '' he said . `` I do n't think glutamate has made them sick . '' And Dr. Robert Kenney of George Washington University conducted an double blind test in 1980 showing that the 35 people who reacted to MSG also had similar reaction when they thought they had MSG but actually not . Although there are many contradicting personal stories told in this group , some of them might have been due to other causes . But because the anti MSG emotion runs so high , that some blame it for anything and everything . My purpose is to present a balance view on the issue , although I am probably 20-1 outnumbered .

The first is more lighthearted and tells about such things as KaflowitzDebatingPoints [ tm ] , which he continues to rack up on both talk.abortion and talk.religion.misc , while setting follow-ups to talk.abortion alone .

You refer to # differing interpretations of `` create , '' and say that many Christians may # not agree . So what ? That is really irrelevant . We do not base our faith # on how many people think one way or another , do we ? The bottom line is # truth , regardless of popularity of opinions . It may be `` irrelevant '' to you and *your* personal beliefs ( or should I say '' bias '' ? ) , but it is relevant to me and many others . You 're right , `` the bottom line IS truth , '' independant from you or anyone else . Since you proclaim `` truths '' as a self-proclaimed appointee , may I ask you by what authority you do this ? Because `` it says so in the Bible ? '' -- Does the Bible `` say so , '' or is it YOU , or someone else , who interprets whether a scripture or doctrine conforms to your particular liking or `` disapproval '' ? Excuse moi , but your line of `` truths '' have n't moved me one bit to persuade me that my beliefs are erroneous . Of all the `` preachers '' of `` truth '' on this net , you have struck me as a self-righteous member of the wrecking crew , with no positive message to me or any other Latter-day Saint ... BTW , this entire discussion reminds me a lot of the things said by Jesus to the pharisees : `` ye hypocrite ( s ) . . . ye preach about me with your lips , but your hearts are far removed from me ... '' # Also , I find it rather strange that in trying to persuade that created # and eternally existent are equivalent , you say `` granted the Mormon # belief ... '' You ca n't grant your conclusion and then expect the point to # have been addressed . In order to reply to the issue , you have to address # and answer the point that was raised , and not just jump to the # conclusion that you grant . Sophistry . Look who 's talking : `` jumping to conclusions ? '' You would n't do that yourself , right ? All YOU address is your own convictions , regardless whether we come up with any Biblical scriptures which supports our points of view , because you reject such interpretations without any consideration whatsoever . # # The Bible states that Lucifer was created . The Bible states that Jesus # is the creator of all . The contradiction that we have is that the LDS # belief is that Jesus and Lucifer were the same . A beautiful example of disinformation and a deliberate misrepresentation of lds doctrine . The former KGB would have loved to employ you . Jesus and lucifer are not `` the same , '' silly , and you know it . ( ... ) # The Mormon belief is that all are children of God . Literally . There is # nothing symbolic about it . This however , contradicts what the Bible # says . The Bible teaches that not everyone is a child of God : Correction : it may contradict would YOU think the Bible says . The Bible indeed does teach that not all are children of God in the sense that they '' belong to '' or follow God in His footsteps . Satan and his followers have rebelled against God , and are not `` children ( =followers/redeemed ) of God , '' but it does n't mean that they were not once created by God , but chose to separate themselves from those who chose to follow God and His plan of salvation . # # The field is the world ; the good seed are the children of the # kingdom ; but the tares are the children of the wicked `` one '' ; # ( Matthew 13:38 ) So ? -- This illustrates nicely what I just said : the children of the kingdom are those who have remained valiant in their testimony of Jesus ( and have shown `` works of repentance , etc . ) , and the children of the wicked one are those who rebelled against God and the lamb . The issue of satan 's spirit-origin ( and of those who followed him ) has not been addressed in this and other verses you copied from your Bible . You purposefully obscured the subject by swamping your `` right '' with non- related scriptures . ( ... lots of nice scriptures deleted ( NOT Robert W. copyrighted ) though ... ) # ra > > We are told that , `` And this is life eternal , that they might know # ra > > thee the only true God , and Jesus Christ , whom thou hast sent .

In this single posting of yours , I 've seen more `` constructs of imagination '' than in all of the pro-lds mails combined I have read so far in this news group . First get your lds-facts straight before you dare preaching to us about `` the only true God , '' whom you interpret according to your own likes and dislikes , but whose image I can not reconcile with what I know about Him myself . I guess your grandiose self-image does not allow for other faiths , believing in the divinity of Jesus Christ , but in a different way or fashion than your own . Not that it really matters , the mission and progress of the lds church will go on , boldly and nobly , and no mob or opponent can stop the work from progressing , until it has visited every continent , swept every clime , and sounded in every ear . # This is really a red herring . It does n't address any issue raised , but # rather , it seeks to obfuscate . The fact that some groups try to read # something into the Bible , does n't change what the Bible teaches . Sigh . `` What the Bible teaches '' ? Or : `` what the bible teaches according to Robert Weiss and co. ? '' I respect the former , I reject the latter without the remotest feeling that I have rejected Jesus . On the contrary . And by the way , I do respect your interpretations of the Bible , I even grant you being a Christian ( following your own image of Him ) , as much as I am a Christian ( following my own image of Him in my heart ) . ( ... ) # Most of the other replies have instead hop-scotched to the issue of # Bruce McConkie and whether his views were 'official doctrine . ' I don't # think that it matters if McConkie 's views were canon . That is not the # issue . Were McConkie 's writings indicative of Mormon belief on this # subject is the real issue . The indication from Rick is that they may # certainly be . The issue is , of course , that you love to use anything to either mis- represent or ridicule the lds church . The issue of `` official doctrine '' is obviously very important . McConkie 's views have been controversial ( e.g . `` The Seven Deadly Heresies '' has made me a heretic ! ; - ) at best , or erroneous at worst ( `` blacks not to receive the priesthood in this dispensation '' ) . I respect him as someone who has made his valuable contribution to the church , but I personally do NOT rely on his personal interpretations ( his book `` Mormon Doctrine '' is oftentimes referred to as `` McConkie 's Bible '' in mormon circles ) on mormon doctrine . I rather look to official ( doctrinal ) sources , and ... to Hugh Nibley 's books ! ( The last comment is an lds-insider reference . ) Summarizing : McConkie was a wise man who contributed undoubtedly far more to the kingdom of God than I have , but whose views are by no means dogma or accepted doctrine , some of it clearly belongs to personal interpretation and speculation . But having said this , I find McConkie ( even in his most biased and speculative moments ) far more thought-provoking than the trash coming from your proverbial pen . I 'm somewhat appalled that I have allowed myself to sink as low as you in this posting ... ============================= Robert Weiss psyrobtw @ ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu Casper C.

I am a picky eater and never wanted to try chinese food , however , I finally tried some in order to please a girl I was seeing at the time . I had never heard of Chinese restaurant syndrome . A group of us went to the restaurant and all shared 6 different dishes . It did n't taste great , but I decided it was n't so bad . We went home and went to bed early . I woke up at 2 AM and puked my guts outs . I threw up for so long that ( I 'm not kidding ) I pulled a muscle in my tongue . Dry heaves and everything . No one else got sick , and I'm not allergic to anything that I know of . Suffice to say that I wont go into a chinese restaurant unless I am physically threatened .

Your claim that the Lebanese/Syrian Landlords sold Palestine ( if true , even partially ) omits the fact that the mandate treaty put Lebanon and Syria under French rule , while Palestine under british . Obiviously , any such landlord would have found himself a foreigner in Palestine and would be motivated to sell , regardless of the price . It is interesting though that you acknowledge that the palestinians were shafted . Do many Israelis or Jews share your opinion ? Do you absolve the purchaser from any ethical commitments just because it was n't written down ? All told , I did not see an answer in your response . The question was whether the intent behind the purchase was aimed at controlling the public assets ( land , infra-structure etc ... ) . IMHO the Palestinians have grounds to contest the legality of the purchase , say in world court . Sam My opinions are my own and no one else 's

Ordinary citizens CAN NOT get a license to carry a concealed weapon . There are very few people who can . I even asked my lawyer friend about this and he told me that only certain people can get licenses for concealed carry . He could n't remember which people but he knew for sure that regular citizens could n't get that type of license . He told me to go check at the library for the statutes which I did .

Some BIOSes do not automatically install COM3 or COM4 in the port tables . Programs like most modem programs which write directly to the port work fine but anything that uses a BIOS call fails . Find a BBS or FTP site where you can get a copy of PORT FINDER . Put '' device=pf.sys '' in your config.sys or run pf.com from your autoexec.bat .

Organization : Iowa State University , Ames IA Lines : 16 I recently read an article in a local paper written by an Islamic person who was upset with the way Islam has been portrayed by western media . When a terrorist action takes place in the middle east , it is always played up as an Islamic Terrorist . However , when the a Serbian terrorist attacks the Croations , its not a Christian terrorist , its just a terrorist . I have often tried to explain this to some close friends who believe the press , that Islam is somehow tied to violence . Often times you hear things like `` They just do n't value human life like we do ... '' and so on . I was wondering if anyone out there had any suggestions for how we can change this image , or how I can help my friends to see that this is just hype .

At this time , no need for a moderator has been assertained . Future evaluation will determine if one is needed . PURPOSE : Access is a new RDBMS for the Windows Operating System . It includes WYSIWYG design tools for easy creation of tables , reports , forms and queries and a database programming language called Access Basic . THe purpose of the group will be to provide help to people who use Access 's WYSIWYG design tools to create simple databases as well as to people who use Access Basic to create complex databases . RATIONALE : Eventhough Access is a new RDBMS , it is very popular because of its Graphical Development enviroment and its initial low price . Been a version 1.0 product means that all Access users are Novices . For that reason a newsgroup is needed where Access users can discuss their experiences with the product and answer each other 's questions . -- Napoleon mau @ herky.cs.uiowa.edu

Just for reference , here 's the earlier quote : Malcolm Lee ( mlee @ post.RoyalRoads.ca ) wrote in reference to Leviticus 21:9 and Deuteronomy 22:20-25 : : These laws written for the Israelites , God 's chosen people whom God had : expressly set apart from the rest of the world . The Israelites were a : direct witness to God 's existence . To disobey God after KNOWing that God : is real would be an outright denial of God and therefore immediately : punishable . : Remember , these laws were written for a different time and applied only to : God 's chosen people . But Jesus has changed all of that . We are living in : the age of grace . Sin is no longer immediately punishable by death . There : is repentance and there is salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ . And : not just for a few chosen people . Salvation is available to everyone , Jew : and Gentile alike . These are two conflicting statements . To say one is a clarification of the other is a breach of logic . I do n't mind people shifting their position on an issue . It irritates me when it is said under the premise that no change was made . What about Deuteronomy 22:20-25 ? Is it wrong now ? Did Jesus change that ? : If anything , He clarified the Law such as in that quote you made . In the : following verses , Jesus takes several portions of the Law and expounds upon : the Law giving clearer meaning to what God intended . Sure he does this . However , he does n't address the notion of stoning non-virgin brides , because this needs no clarification . Are you going to deny that Deuteronomy 22:20-25 is not patently clear in its intent ? : I think you will agree with me that there are in today 's world , a lot of : modern-day Pharisees who know the bible from end to end but do not believe : in it . What good is head knowledge if there is nothing in the heart ? I 'll agree that there is a lot of modern day Pharisees that know the Bible from end to end and do n't believe in it . Depending on how they use this knowledge , they can be scary . They can argue any position they desire , and back it up with selected parts of the Bible . Such Pharisees include David Koresh and Adolph Hitler . I will qualify this by saying *I do n't know* if they actually believed what they were preaching , but the ends certainly made the means look frightening . However , just as scary are those that do n't know much of the Bible , but believe every word . In fact , this is probably scarier , since there are far more of these people , from what I 've seen . In addition , they are very easy to manipulate by the aforementioned Pharisees , since they do n't know enough to debate with these people . : Christianity is not just a set of rules ; it 's a lifestyle that changes one's : perspectives and personal conduct . And it demands obedience to God 's will . No , it demands obedience to a book . If God came down and personally told me how I should behave , then I would say that I would be doing God 's will by doing it . However , if preachers , pastors , and evangelists tell me to obey the will of a book written by people who have been dead for close to two millenia ( even longer for the OT ) , even if I follow everything in it with my heart , I could scarcely be honest with myself by saying I 'm doing the will of God . : Some people can live by it , but many others can not or will not . That is : their choice and I have to respect it because God respects it too . Well , if God respects it so much , how come there is talk in the Bible about eternal damnation for non-believers ?

If the frequency path depends on they key , as I > understand it to , it *could* be made effectively impossible to record . I am not an expert in the cryptography science , but some basic things seem evident to me , things which this Clinton Clipper do not address . The all pertain to opportunites for abuse , and conclusions based on what I have seen the membership of this group ( except for two notable persons ) agree to . If anything bad is possible by the government in theory , it almost always ends up happening in fact . So the key is to make abuse IMPOSSIBLE . Question authority , and remember power DOES corrupt . I think one has to regard this whole idea in the sense that it WILL be expanded to include other data forms , such as data transfer and stored data . and as such should be treated as if it were expanded ( or such expansion will be almost impossible to stop , using Clipper as a precident ) . There was a hint of that in the proposal , remember . That said , please bear with me , I am not very articulate , so I take more words to say what others could say much more briefly . Thank you . > Once it hits land you can record it if you have telco access . The > telco is n't supposed to give that without a warrant . That 's the rule > today . As I suggested this is NOW . The hint is in the proposal that this or similar proposals are being considered for other forms of encryptions such as data transfer , data files , and such , largely dependent on how this thing is accepted or flies . I think one would be wise to treat this in the manner one would when ( not if ) it gets expanded to other areas than cellular phones . I think this is guaranteed to happen , if this proposal gets by . Salami politics . It has been and is used in several other areas , it is certain to be used here . Government is not going to easily give up on the idea that they should be able to eavesedrop whenever they want to . 'Court order required ' has proven to be a rather flimsy guarantee . If the case warrants , they can always sieze the material , and force one to give the key , or sit in jail forever on periodically renewed contempt charges . So it is not denying the justice system the information , nor the ability to lock someone up if guilty ( or refuses to divulge the means to access the info - this is not protected under the Fifth - one can be forced to perform ACTS that would result in divulging incriminating evidence ) . So , blocking restrictions on private encryption is not preventing LEGITIMATE law enforcement - it does make ILLEGITIMATE law enforcement a bunch more difficult . Especially fishing expeditions without the target 's knowlege . Do n't give up the right to be safe from that - that should be non-negotiable , and Clinton and Co. know it ( which is probably why they quietly developed this thing , figuring if they get it this far , they can ram it on through ) . How come those consulted could be roughly described as `` us insiders '' ? They can not quietely IMPLIMENT it though , when they ban other schemes to ensure its exclusive use . Hence the nice PR document to try and reassure everyone . Do n't buy into it . Has government really earned that kind of trust , past or future ? To be secure and free , one must keep government honest and the only way to do that is to make abuse IMPOSSIBLE , not 'unlikely' or 'difficult ' . > But even so , the evidence would not be admissible , I think , unless the > judge so ordered . I think that even interception of the crypttext > without a warrant would be illegal . Cops ca n't record today 's plain > cellular calls and then ask a judge , `` Hey , can we have permission to > listen to those tapes ? '' can they ? So what ? One could use information gained by re-use of the keys ( saved after the last case was finished ) or other means ( master key , backdoor , easily broken algorithm ) to find other evidence which , given to a judge , would authorize a tap which would n't have been possible otherwise . This has been the more common manner of abuse of wiretaps in the past ... For local cops , this might be workable to keep them honest , but the Feds have a workaround somehow , BET on it . Does anyone really believe for example , that the government will use a scheme NSA can not listen in on scanning for keywords - either easily defeated in realtime or via a 'master key ' ? I sure do n't . This whole thing sounds like something to eliminate the need to use old-fashioned police work to build a case . In the past , eavesdropping was rather easy ( with or without a court order ) . I think the Law Enforcement community has become a bit spoiled , and will resist changes that require them to revert to using old-fashioned detective work . I just find it somewhat surprising coming from a bunch that cares so much about civil and individual rights , that `` puts people first '' . The question is `` put people first '' to WHERE ? With the innards not being revealed , how is one to be sure there DOESN'T exist a 'master key ' for use by NSA , etc ( so they can do their keyword scan , etc on conversations they routinely monitor , without a specific court order ) ? Remember , the cellular phone limitiation is only TEMPORARY . Bet on it . And so far I have not heard about police telling people that they have been tapped and nothing incriminating was found . What is to keep them from simply keeping the keys on file for 'next time ' ? After awhile , they would have quite a collection . Kept especially for folks they deem 'disruptive ' . And if they get only one key , that would reduce the search space a lot , unless it is an RSA scheme . Remember Nixon years ? Need for court orders really slowed them down , did n't it ? And unless the escrow accounts are not government controlled ( fat chance ! I see one ending up being under , say Treasury , the other under Justice : - ) ) it could be worth some serious bucks to some folks to get keys to a competitor 's Clinton Clipper ( or descendent when this idea is expanded to be used for all non-government encryption ) . Enough bucks would get one the keys or the innards for this algorithm . Perhaps not an important concern , but given past government behavior and the other problems ... > > worse , of course , if the government then uses this `` Clinton Clipper '' > > to argue for restrictions on unapproved encryption .

That 's why he 's in jail now . > Hard to believe , but true . What will one do when it is expanded to data storage encryption ? You can BET that if Clipper is accepted , that will be next on the agenda . It is even hinted at in the proposal - read it carefully ... Expect the argumet `` well , if you got nothing to hide ... '' Fine . Then using that argument , one should not object to video cameras being installed in every room of one 's home . Granted - an exteme expansion of the idea but the principle holds . Private stuff should remain private , even from a govt fishing expedition . And laws/rules may change in the future as to 'safeguards ' . When it comes to the Fed Government , safeguards are pretty meaningless , if they want to do/get something . Do n't work so hard to give up some rather treasured rights , or establish bad precidents , please . The price could be hell to pay , later . > This scheme can succeed without laws forbidding more , which people would > fight a lot harder . They like this enough that they are dropping the so > called `` Digital Telephony '' proposal , according to rumours . However the > meaning of that is complex , since they still want to get at the crypttext > on telco systems , and that requires a bit of work . People would fight laws forbidding more NOW , but in , say two years , because we have this 'crisis ' situation which MUST be addressed by some 'drastic action ' , just this added reasonable restriction will only bother those who have someting to hide ... etc . Please do n't buy into it . If the Clinton Clipper is so very good , why not make its algrithm public so many people can exchange ideas and examine it , rather than a few isolated 'respected experts ' ( respected by whom ? for what ? Perhaps a certain professor who likes key banks would be one of the selected experts ... this does seem to expand on some ideas the person was advocating , if I recall : - ) . How would anybody know that what the experts examine is the same as what will end up being used in the Clipper Chip , if it is kept secret ? Perhaps the Clipper will use a crippled version ( with a 'master key ' provision ) , or features not present in the version subjected for study and evaluation by the experts . And who chooses the expertes ? The government ? No conflict of interest there ... : - ) And is n't it a REQUIREMENT for any decent encryption scheme that it NOT have its effectiveness reduced by having the algrorithm widely known ? I was lead to believe that one should assume the other side has everything you have , except for the key ( s ) ... I recall ideas presented to this group are rejected if a requirement exists the algorithm be secret ... Another question - since it is a safe bet this Clipper thing would not be used for government security , they are regarding it as not real secure but `` good enough '' for common folk . I think I would like to see a full description ( not a PR non-statement ) of just what `` good enough '' means ? I think when saying how strong it is , `` good enough '' really means `` not very '' . The excuse that other countries have these restrictions is not acceptable : Other countries do not have our Bill of Rights and Constitution ( which the people , not the governments , of those other countries often regard with envy - what we have as rights they have as revokable privileges ) . And if we expect to retain those rights and protections , we must not allow them to be gutted because we just GOT TA have this thing to 'fight crime ' . We have allready have our Bill of Rights pretty much torn to shreds . We should not permit more weakining for yet another 'noble cause ' , instead we should be trying to repair the damage . Our crime problem may have a number of causes , but `` too many rights and safeguards '' is not a signifigant one . A broken court system and poor police work are a much more signifigant cause as having '' too many rights '' ( disregarding addressing the root causes for crime , etc ) . BTW - those who suggest that this is just an attack on Clinton , believe this : I would be going ballistic reagardless WHO seriously proposed this thing . It is just another step in a gradual erosion of our rights under the Constitution or Bill of Rights . The last couple of decades have been a non-stop series of end-runs around the protections of the Constitution . It has to stop . Now is as good a time as any , if it is n't too late allready . > -- > Brad Templeton , ClariNet Communications Corp. -- Sunnyvale , CA 408/296-0366 -- pat @ rwing.uucp [ Without prejudice UCC 1-207 ] ( Pat Myrto ) Seattle , WA If all else fails , try : ... ! uunet ! pilchuck ! rwing ! pat WISDOM : `` Only two things are infinite ; the universe and human stupidity , and I am not sure about the former .

The runner can leave his base at any time . If the ball is caught , he 's got to tag up . If it is n't caught , he _doesn't_ have to tag up at all . So , if he 's feeling lucky , your runner at second can sprint for glory as soon as the ball is popped up . If it is n't caught , he 's probably scored a run . If it is , he 's probably headed for AAA . The only effect the infield fly has is to make the batter out , thereby removing the force on the runners on base .

Pardon me for being a little confused , but at the beginning of your second paragraph , you say , `` God has one set of rules for all his people , '' yet at the end of the same paragraph you declare , `` please do not combine the ceremonial and moral laws in one . '' Not only do I not understand where in the Bible you find the declaration that there are 2 laws ( ceremonial and moral ) , but I am also unclear on whether you think it is bad to have 2 sets of laws in the first place . If it 's bad to have 2 sets of laws , how can there be a ceremonial law that is different from the moral law ( and vice versa ) ? I would also be interested in your comments on the passage in I Cor . 10:1-16 , where Paul teaches different rules for covering you head while praying depending on whether you are a man or a woman . Do you think the apostles can prescribe different sets of rules for men and women ? If so , then why not for Jews and Gentiles ?

The primary U.S. objection is `` Iran 's international behaviour '' which includes `` extending support of violence '' to disrupt the Arab Israeli peace process and its rapid build-up of dangerous weapons . Mack said `` Iran could contribute to regional stability and peace but first it is to end the behaviour which threatens this area . '' Mack spoke at the U.S.-GCC business conference aimed at promoting Gulf-American trade . He said the `` Middle East will be an item very high on the agenda of the U.S . administration . '' The importance of the Gulf is underlined by Secretary of State Warren Christoper 's visit last year to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait before anywhere else in the world , Mack said . He added that the U.S. has no long-term plan to station troops in the Gulf . Mack also insisted that the Clinton administration will continue to pressure Iraq to `` comply with all the U.N.

VESA-compliant applications should have no trouble setting these modes . ( But I 'm forwarding your posting to our Software group , just in case .

Higher vertical resolution > was the main reason I bought the card over the Orchid F. VLB I currently have , > and it will do 1024x768x70 Hz as well . I think we go to AT LEAST 76 Hz at 1024x768x8 , and maybe more ( and it 's a function of the RAMDAC speed , not the Power 9000 ) . We need to fix the problems you 've noted ( they were already on the list ) . If you 're really interested , though , take a look at the text file P9000RES.DAT , which holds the data from which the choices in the P9000 monitor installation program are built . Working by analogy , you can build up a new monitor definition that has the right combinations of refresh rates for your monitors . Keep a backup copy of the file ! Once you 've built a new version of the P9000RES.DAT file , run the P9000 installation program , INST , and your new choices should show up . ( This assumes you have the WEITEK v. 2.2 drivers . You can tell the rev number by looking at the modification time of the driver : 02:20 is version 2.20 . Microsoft uses this gimmick , too . ) > The board is faster that the OFVLB for most things according to the Hercules > Speedy program .

The SPEEDY benchmark was put out by Hercules and IIT , who to my knowledge were unencumbered by any motivations except making the Hercules Graphite/IIT AGX014 card look really good . So I 'd take the numbers with a ton of salt . ( Texas Instruments did the same thing with WINTACH , trying to make the 34020 look good compared to the 8514 , as if anyone cared . ) It 's safer ( though not safe ) to use benchmarks from `` unbiased '' sources , such as testing labs , columnists , etc . > Interestingly , the solid > vectors and shaded polygons show no improvement , and hatched polygons ( ie , > filled with cross-hatching ) and Ternary Rops ( whatever they are .

Then the speed increases dramatically . Sounds > like programming to a benchmark to me ... . Font caching is a perfectly legitimate optimization -- Windows has hooks for it built right into the GDI . What 's kind of silly is IIT's use of a hardwired `` The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog then sat on a tack '' string in their driver . Not only is it useless in real applications , it lacks the programming elegance of the `` Bart Simpson optimization , '' in which you save the bitmap of the most-recently drawn string in off-screen memory , and just do a screen-to-screen bitblit if you happen to be given that same string a second time in a row . ( We call it the `` Bart Simpson optimization '' because Bart 's the only person we can see benefiting from it : he could right `` I will not cheat on benchmarks '' a hundred times and be done in half the time it would take to actually form each character . ) > I make no claims that these numbers mean anything at all .

I am seeing a strange problem with text in clients like xvt ( a simple terminal emulator program ) . The problem manifests it self when the shell echoes typed characters back to the server for display , one at a time . The characters appear to be too closely spaced , with the result being that the 2nd character echoed destroys the rightmost edge of the first character , then the 3rd character destroys the rightmost edge of the second character , and so on . It looks like there is an invisible boundary around a character which obscures a portion of the previous character . There is no problem between the characters when the shell returns a complete line of text ... only when the output is a series of individual characters . If anyone has any ideas what the problem might be , or where I should look to find it , it would be much appreciated .

This is a PhD research project and I have to test the chip at speed on a PCB . I expect to have roughly 100 packaged circuits and will do DC , low-speed and high-speed testing using 3 different set-ups for the test chip . I know for sure that a DIP will not work ( the long lead lines have too high an inductance ) . Getting a custom-made package is too expensive , so I am trying to choose between a flatpak and a leadless chip carrier . The flatpack would be hard to test since it has to be soldered on to the test setup and I would spend loads of time soldering as I kept changing the test chip . The leadless chip carrier sockets also have long lead lines and may not work at high speeds . Does anyone out there have experience/knowledge of this field ? I would greatly appreciate help ! Any ideas/ names of companies manufacturing holders/sockets/packages would help . P.S . The multi-layer fancy GaAs packages seem like a bit of overkill ( ? ) -- - Seema Varma

Lines : 53 ( Below is my response to Dr. Denning 's letter to Steven Bellovin . Comments are invited . - Paul ) In alt.privacy.clipper , Steve Bellovin posted your message to him , which included a brief passage concerning selection of agencies as escrow agencies . I am glad to see that the proposal as written states that the escrow agencies wo n't be law enforcement agencies . I would argue , however , that *one* of the escrow agencies should n't be federal at all . As a private citizen , I would feel much more `` secure in my person and papers '' knowing that an organization committed to individual civil liberties- the ACLU and the NRA come to mind- was safeguarding half of my key . Both the ACLU and the NRA are resistent to government pressure by the simple expedient fact that they are not supported , funded , or overtly controlled by the government . Of those federal and federally funded candidate agencies that you mentioned , I have the following comments : - SRI , Rand , Mitre , and national labs : I agree that they have great experience safeguarding sensitive information . I am not convinced that they would adequately safeguard _this_ information , since in any case requiring disclosure , there's likely to be sigificant pressure for disclosure- possibly *wrongful* disclosure . - GAO : perhaps . I would like to see more concrete evidence of their fidelity and ability . - *TREASURY* ? Surely you 're joking . Perhaps you 'd ask BATF to safeguard keys . Maybe the Federal Reserve would be a better choice . Ever since last fall 's `` trial balloon '' was posted in sci.crypt , your name has been synonymous with those who place a great deal of trust in the ability of government agencies and agents to act within the law . I agree with you in part : those agencies and agents *almost always* act properly . However , there have been enough cases where _sworn agents of the Federal Government_ have acted wrongly to make me feel that having two federal agencies as key repositories is unacceptable .

( Poor you ! ) The Macroscrubber from Radio Electronics removes the protection so you sould n't have any more problems . However , if you use the method of copying it from one VCR to another where the second VCR does n't react to the protection , you will end up with a duplicate tape , including the protection . One thought comes to mind about your problem ... When playing the tape for viewing , are you feeding the signal from the source VCR through an extra device before going to the TV ? If you feed it through a second VCR first , that is your problem . As to other devices such as converters , I do n't know if they would react or not .

First , I should point out that many Jews do not in fact agree with the idea that the West Bank is theirs . Since , however , I agree with those who claim the West Bank , I think I can answer your question thusly : the West bank was what is called the spoils of war . Hussein ordered the Arab Legion to attack Israel , which was a poor move , seeing as how the Israelis promptly kicked his butt . The territory is therefore forefeit . Retaining possession of ALL of the West bank is not desirable , but it beats national suicide for the Israelis . Put another way , one could ask why it is that so many Palestinians seem to think that Tel-Aviv belongs to them and the future state of Palestine . As long as this state of affairs continues , it seems that to give the Palestinians a place from which they can launch attacks on Jews is a real poor idea . Giving up the entire West Bank would be idiotic froma security standpoint . In addition , there is the small matter of Jerusalem , which is considered to be part of the West Bank . The chances of the Israelis giving up Jerusalem are nil . Even leftists who think Yasser is a really cool dude , like Yossi Sarid , are n't going to propose giving up Jerusalem .

From : jer @ prefect.cc.bellcore.com ( rathmann , janice e ) Subject : Re : Sinus vs. Migraine ( was Re : Sinus Endoscopy ) Organization : Bellcore , Livingston , NJ Summary : Headaches and analgesics Lines : 95 I noticed several years ago that when I took analgesics fairly regularly , ( motrin at the time ) , I seemed to get a lot of migraines . But had forgotten about that until I started reading some of the posts here . I generally do n't take NSAIDS or Tylenol for headaches , because I've found them to be ineffective . However , I have two other pain sources that force me to take NSAIDS ( currently Naprosyn ) . First , is some pelvic pain that I get at the beginning of my period , and then much worse at midcycle . I have had surgery for endometriosis in the past ( ~12 years ago ) , so the Drs . tell me that my pain is probably due to the endometriosis coming back . I 've tried Synarel , it reduced the pain while I took it ( 3 mos ) , but the pain returned immediately after I stopped . Three doctors have suggested hysterectomy as the only `` real solution '' to my problem . Although I do n't expect to have any more children , I do n't like the idea of having my uterus and one remaining ovary removed ( the first ovary was removed when I had the surgery for endometriosis ) . One of the Drs that suggested I get a hysterectomy is an expert in laser surgery , but perhaps thinks that type of procedure is only worthwhile on women who still plan to have children . So basically all I 'm left with is toughing out the pain . This would be impossible without Naprosyn ( or something similar - but not aspirin , that does n't work , and Motrin gave me horrible gastritis a few years ago , so I 'm through with it ) . In fact , Naprosyn works very well at eliminating the pain if I take it regularly as I did when I had severe back pain ( and pain in both legs ) as I 'll discuss in a moment . Generally though , I wait until I have the pain before I take the Naprosyn , but then it takes several hours for it reduce the pain ( it 's actually quite effective at reducing the pain , it just takes quite a while ) . In the meantime I 'm frequently in severe pain . The other pain source I have is chronic lower back pain resulting in bilateral radiculopathy . I 've had MRIs , Xrays , CT scan , and EMGs ( I 've had 2 of them , and do n't intend to ever do that again ) with nerve conduction tests . The tests have not been conclusive as to what is causing my back and leg pain . The MRI reports both say I have several bulging , degeneratig disks , and from the Xrays ( and MRI , I think ) it is apparent that I have arthritis . The reading on the CT scan was that there are two herniations ( L3-L4 , and L4-L5 ) , but others hav looked at the films and concluded that there are no herniations . The second EMG and nerve conduction studies shows significant denervation compared to the first EMG . Oh yeah , I had some other horrible test , called something like Somatic Evoked Response which showed that the '' internal nerves '' are working fine . Anyway , the bottom line is that I sometimes have severe pain in both legs and back pain . The back pain is there all the time , but I can live with it . When the leg pain is there , I need some analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication to reduce the pain to a level where I can work . So I took Naprosyn regulary for 6-9 months ( every time I tried to stop the leg pain got worse , so I 'd always resume ) . Since last November I have taken it much less frequently , and primarily for the pelvic pain . I have been going to physical therapy for the last 8 months ( 2-3 times a week ) . After the first month or so , my therapist put me on pelvic traction ( she had tried it earlier , but it had caused a lot of pain in my back , this time she tried it at a lower weight ) . After a month or two , the pain in my legs began going away ( but the traction aways caused discomfort in my lower back , which could be reduced with ultrasound and massage ) . So now , I do n't have nearly as much pain in my legs , in fact my therapist took me off traction about 2 weeks ago . Getting back to my original reason for this post ... Even if I can avoid taking analgesic for headaches , I really ca n't avoid them entirely because I have other pain sources , that `` force '' me to use them ( Oh , I forgot to mention that it has been suggested to me that I have back surgery , but I 'm avoiding that too ) . I find the migraines difficult to deal with , occassionally I have to take off work , but usually I can work , but at a reduced capacity ( I 'm a systems engineer and do a lot of reading and writing ) . When the pelvic pain is bad , I ca n't concentrate much , I usually end up jumping out of my chair every few minutes , because the pain is so bothersome . When the pain in my back is bad , it can cause severe burning in both legs , shooting pains in my legs , electric shock type of pain in my feet and toes , and basically when it gets bad I ca n't really sit at all . Then I end up spending most of my time home and in bed . So even if the analgesics contribute to the migraines , the migraines are more tolerable than the other pain sources . I get a lot of migraines , an average of 3 to 4 a month , which last 1-3 days . I 've taken cafergot ( the first time the caffiene really got to me so I reduced the dosage ) , but I do n't like the side effects ( if I take more than two I get diahrea ) . If I get a very bad headache , I will eventually take the cafergot . My neurologist was n't very helpful when I told him my problems with cafergot , he said that when sumatriptan becomes available , I should try that . I 've tried several other medications ( fiornal , midrin , fiornal with codeine , tegretol , and inderal ) but they either did n't work , or I could n't tolerate them . So what can I do ? My doctor 's seem to be satisfied with me just trying to tolerate the pain , which I agree with most of the time , but not when I have a lot of pain . I 've had some bad experiences with surgery ( my heart stopped once from the anesthesia - I was told that it was likely the succinylcholine ) , and I 've already had surgery several times . Anyway , the point of what I 'm saying is that even if analgesics can contribute to migraines , some people NEED to take them to tolerate other pain . Janice Rathmann

Last night during a Sharks ' broadcast , Commissioner Bettman was interviewed during the first intermission . He made no bones about it , the expansion to 28 is on permanent hold until he is satisfied that the current allotment of 26 are fully stable . This means that cities looking for a club in the foreseeable future will have to wait until one team in some location fails or looks to relocate . This is good , IMO .

The numbers comparing hundreds of thousands ( indeed , even a million ) of instances of law abiding citizens deterring criminal activity , seem valid to me . Likewise the number of gun-caused homicides each year ( about 11,000/year ? ) . However , it is surprising that the `` Evil AntiGun Empire `` ( Darth Vader breathing sound effect here ) never tries to compare '' All legitimate gun defenses '' vs. `` All gun crimes . '' Instead , it 's always `` All legitimate gun defenses , '' which includes cases in which the criminals are shot but not killed , and cases in which the criminal is not here , vs. just criminal gun homicides , which only includes case sin which the victim died . Why is this ? Of course , it would n't be unreasonable to say that in each crime already measured ( involving guns ) , the consequnces are already known and it is safe to assume that a gun-based bank robbery last week will not suddenly turn into a gun-basd robbery+homicide . Whereas in the legitimate gun defenses , one may assume that all those criminals who were deterred would have committed more crime or more serious crimes had they not been deterred . -Case Kim kim39 @ husc.harvard.edu

It has been used for 1 season on my sailboat . All parts are included as well as the installation instructions . It is even packed in the original box it came in . There is no damage to the unit or the transducer . In fact , the transducer was mounted *inside* the hull in a piece of pipe glued to the hull . So it led a `` sheltered '' life . The transducer can be mounted either inside the hull as I did , or on the transom . It can not be placed in a hole drilled into your hull . It is fully waterproof and fits into a 2 '' hole in a bulkhead ( that 's where I had it installed ) or into a standard dashboard on a powerboat . It reads depth to 199 ' and has a backlit LCD display . It has an adjustable shallow water alarm built in . I am changing out my instruments to another manufacturer that outputs the NMEA 0183 information . This little depth sounder works fine and is very stable . It is usually priced as low as 130 $ in some catalogs , I paid 150 $ . The first 80 $ takes it , or best offer . John R. Miller Catalina 22 , # 4909 `` Tinker Toy ''

Tammy , is this all explicitly stated in the bible , or do you assume that you know that Ezekiel indirectly mentioned ? It could have been another metaphor , for instance Ezekiel was mad at his landlord , so he talked about him when he wrote about the prince of Tyre .

From : maridai @ comm.mot.com ( Marida Ignacio ) Subject : Refusing Divine Peace and Alive Prayer ? ( was Re : Question about Mary ) Organization : trunking_fixed Lines : 147 It 's like refusing 'God 's kingdom come ' . In one of Jesus ' revelation in this century , `` ... same thing as in the old days . People refuse to believe my messengers . Even when I was alive here on earth , they refuse Me . What more when I am just talking through somebody else ? '' ( paraphrased ) . With all the knowledge believers accumulated , He would think that we would be 'enlightened ' enough to detect which ones are 'authentic and divine ' as opposed to 'evil or man-made ' . These signs , these miracles , are you afraid that they are not from God ? That these are the signs we should not open our hearts and mind to for thinking they are evil ? Well , is faith in God evil ? Is true peace evil ? Is true love that is divine and pure evil ? Why ca n't someone accept that God can do what He wants in fulfillment of His generous love and Jesus ' never ending forgiveness to those who turn back to Him for salvation ? Why are we refusing God 's messenger of this truth ? The mother to all who are in Christ ? What brings us these : fears of being shamed by what others will think or say about us ? which , in contrary , could be pleasing to God ? fears of being humbled ? fears of being judged as wrong ( wrt mainstream standard of what is right ) ? Why ca n't we tolerate non-believers ' mockery or ridicule of us for the sake of peace , love and obedience to God ? The humbling lessons left to us by martyrs and saints ? We 'd rather engage in never-ending bickering and disproof of each other's opinion - looking at each other 's mistakes - for the sake of arguments , instead of having communion in one body with Christ . What makes us go blind to the truth that God is All Powerful and that He can not be binded by what people wrote and have written about Him in all ages ? Why is our faith in God limited ? By all the words and literature we muster ? What prevents us from going *beyond* being saved and extend God 's rich love to others who are not ? Why are our eyes not wide open to see that He continuously sees our faith , hope and love which glorify Him and so He gives us indications of His acknowledgements with signs/miracles ( ordinary/common or divinely inspired ) everywhere ? Is n't that like an atheist/agnostic 's view that all these are just ordinary here on earth and not caused by anything supernatural ? Why then does the Holy Mother comes back to remind us : `` We must really __accept that prayer__ changes the course of things and that with prayers __even wars can be prevented__ . '' but then she continues : `` You often have an egotistic attitude . Dear children , in these days you have prayed very much , __but your hands have remained empty__ . '' Why hesitate in proclaiming what needs to be done : `` prayer , conversion , peace , penance , fasting , the Holy Mass , living life as what the Gospel brings. '' ? Why not do so ? How ? To the world ? To this , the Mother says : `` Start in your family . Be a good example . Live the Word . '' Why worry if it is going to be of good use to many ? Our Holy Mother says : `` The fruits , __leave them to the Lord__ , do not worry about anything or anyone but entrust yourself to the Lord . '' Although the Holy Mother does not insist because : `` You are free ; I bow before the freedom which God gives you . '' but she follows this with : `` You are surprised because I say to you : Decide for God and yet , see how you have lived this day . '' Why does she constantly conveys : `` Take this life toward God in the way as to __experience__ the Lord Himself in your __behavior__ and __not only__ when you pray '' or one time when we decide that we are saved , or talk/write about God , etc . The Holy Mother warns : `` Satan ( the serpent ) is always trying to dissuade you to turn you away from my peace plan and prayer . '' ( Rev 12:17 , the dragon became angry with the woman and went off to wage war against the rest of her offsprings , those who keep God 's commandments , and bear witness to Jesus . ) Do you have fear or hate for God 's current messenger of true peace , love and our motherly protector from the anti-Christ ? The one who is being apprehensive of communism , wars , famine and other evils that the serpent brings upon us ? This obedient and blessed new Eve ? The mother who warns us so we can be prepared and be strong against Satan ? Have n't there been renewed faith , hope , love , peace and obedience wherever this messenger has shared her blessings and graces that God has given her in good purpose ? Why do we choose to be blind ? Why fear the truth that God has been giving us a chance and sharing Christ's ever-forgetting forgiveness to us through the obedient mother ? The mother who has been consecrated the task __to reverse__ the disobedient harm and example done by the ancient Eve . She has been preparing the new Eden with her Immaculate Heart . The new Eden as sanctuary ( the womb ) for the next coming and judgement of the righteous by our Lord , Jesus Christ ; when The Lamb marries His bride . Should n't we give her a hand in her exhaustive job of preparing us for the second coming of her Son as she has been conceived without sin to bear the Son of God in her womb ? Why fear true peace , love and renewed faith and obedience to God that Mary faithfully brings to God 's children ? She has been protecting the flock ( the rest of the offsprings ) from the greedy dragon so as to present more righteous members for her Son 's coming . Not all apparitions and miracles that resulted from them are worthy of belief . With prayer and guidance from the Holy Spirit and , of course , approval of our Church authorities , we should be aware of the true and divinely inspired ones ; specifically , the ones which aligns with the Scripture . Also , our Lady reminds us of recommendation of __silence__ in our prayers : `` If you speak unceasingly in your prayers , how will you be able to hear God ? Allow Him room to answer you , to speak to you . '' She encourages us ( with motherly nurturing ) to continue in exuberant faith , hope and love to Jesus , constantly . NOT with mere emotions , but with deep , constant obedience to Jesus , her Beloved Son and acknowledgement of our need to have Him as part of our lives . Let 's not wait to the last minute to renew our faith and the life that God wants us to live ; when there wo n't be enough time or when it will be late . Nowadays , Mary says , '' Pray , pray , pray for peace ... reconciliation , my children . '' Have peace within yourself first before you can promote peace to others . For without peace , you can not fully accept my Son . '' And you think she 's just an ordinary lady . Not to me . She's our good Mother/messenger from God and she is so nice enough to share God 's kingdom to us through her Son and experience it . With Mary , we are assured that The Lamb always succeeds . -- -- - Note : All enclosed in quotes are from `` Latest News of Medjugorje '' Number 10 , June , 1991 by Fr .

Has anyone out there had some experience in doing this ? The specs call for a few sequences to be met before standby mode is activated , and are a bit hard to decipher on that , but I thought that I had it worked out . However , with a 32kHz crystal the lowest current drain I can acheive at 3.7V Vcc is 150uA . This is three times the specified MAXIMUM under the conditions I am attempting to create . I have done the following things : 1 ) Made sure that RESET/ is asserted for Trlh after powerup , and AS is low during this time . 2 ) Made sure that there is a cycle on AS after the negation of RD/ or WR/ during which STBY/ was asserted . What am I doing wrong ? Thanks very much , Martin .

Koberg , Just a couple of minor corrections here ... 1 ) The Churches of Christ do not usually believe in speaking in tongues , in fact many of them are known for being strongly opposed to Pentecostal teaching . You are probably thinking of Church of God in Christ , the largest African-American Pentecostal denomination . 2 ) I 'm not sure what you mean by `` signifying believers '' but it should be pointed out that the Assemblies of God does not now , nor has it ever , held that speaking in tongues is the sign that one is a Christian . The doctrine that traditional Pentecostals ( including the A/G ) maintain is that speaking in tongues is the sign of a second experience after becoming a Christian in which one is `` Baptized in the Holy Spirit '' That may be what you were referring to , but I point this out because Pentecostals are frequently labeled as believing that you have to speak in tongues in order to be a Christian . Such a position is only held by some groups and not the majority of Pentecostals . Many Pentecostals will quote the passage in Mark 16 about `` these signs following them that believe '' but they generally do not interpret this as meaning if you do n't pactice the signs you aren't '' saved '' . 3 ) I know it 's hard to summarize the beliefs of a movement that has such diversity , but I think you 've made some pretty big generalizations here . Do `` Neo-Pentecostals '' only believe in tongues as a sign and tongues as prayer but NOT tongues as revelatory with a message ? I 've never heard of that before . In fact I would have characterized them as believing the same as Pentecostals except less likely to see tongues as a sign of Spirit Baptism . Also , while neo-Pentecostals may not be inclined to speak in tongues in the non-Pentecostal churches they attend , they do have their own meetings and , in many cases , a whole church will be charismatic .

I do n't think this is a bad thing . > First of all , I resent your assumption that you know why I am threatened by science , or even that I am threatened at all , although I admit the latter . The reason I am threatened by Science has nothing to do with my need for proof of my Lord 's existence -- God reveals Himself in many ways , including , to some degree , Science . My problem with Science is that often it allows us to assume we know what is best for ourselves . God endowed us with the ability to produce life through sexual relations , for example , but He did not make that availible to everyone . Does that mean that if Science can over-ride God 's decision through alterations , that God wills for us to have the power to decide who should and should not be able to have children ? Should men be allowed to have babies , if that is made possible . People have always had the ability to end lives unnaturally , and soon may have the ability to bring lives into the world unnaturally . The closest thing to artificially created life is artificially created death , and as God has reserved judgement about when people should die to Himself , I believe we should rely on God 's wisdom about how people should be brought in to the world . This is not to say that I reject all forms of medical treatment , however . Treatment that alleviates pain , or prevents pain from occuring , is perfectly acceptable , I believe , as it was acceptable for Jesus to cure the sick . However , treatment that merely prolongs life for no reason , or makes unnecessary alterations to the body for mere aesthetic purposes , go too far . Are we not happy with the beauty God gave us ? I can not draw a solid line regarding where I would approve of Scientific study , and where I would not , but I will say this : Before one experiments with the universe to find out all its secrets , one should ask why they want this knowledge . Before one alters the body they have been given , they should ask themseles why their body is not satisfactory too them as it is . I can not make any general rules that will cover all the cases , but I will say that each person should pray for guidance when trying to unravel the mysteries of the universe , and should cease their unravelling if they have reason to believe their search is displeasing to God . -- -Malcusco

A cheap laser printer does not manage that sort of throughput and on top of that how long does the _first_ sheet take to print ? Inkjets are faster than you say and in both cases the computer often has trouble keeping up with the printer . ( I have a 486/33 and a lot of drivers can not keep up with the printer ) A sage said to me : `` Do you want one copy or lots of copies ? `` , `` One '' , '' Inkjet '' . > Something else to think about is the cost of consumables over the > life of the printer .

Laser printers are usually desinged > for higher duty cycles in pages per month and longer product > replacement cycles . Paper cost is the same and both can use refills . Long term the laserprinter will need some expensive replacement parts ( consumables ) and on top of that are the amortisation costs which favour the lowest purchase cost printer . HP inkjets understand PCL so in many cases a laserjet driver will work if the software package has no inkjet driver . There is one wild difference between the two printers : a laserprinter is a page printer whilst an inkjet is a line printer . This means that a laserprinter can rotate graphic images whilst an inkjet can not . Few drivers actually use this facility . ( there is also the matter of downloadable fonts and so on ) TC .

From : jayne @ mmalt.guild.org ( Jayne Kulikauskas ) Subject : What 's in a name ? : the sequel Organization : Kulikauskas home Lines : 57 I 've been thinking about the idea that was raised ( by Michael Covington , I think ) that words mean what we think they mean , regardless of etymology . I 've been reflecting on what certain words meant in my childhood and tracing how this shaped some of my attitudes . I grew up in a home where Christ was a bad word . People who were very angry said it . The word Christian meant someone who was not a Jew . It carried connotations of otherness , of threat , of enemy . It took some time to figure out that there was a connection between ` Christ ' and ` Christian ' . When I accepted Jesus , I expected to be disowned . To become a Christian meant to join the enemy . I knew others would consider me a traitor . At some level , I agreed , but was still prepared to pay this price . Like Esau , I sold my birthright . However , I made a better bargain . He only got some stew , but I got the incomparable riches of knowing Christ . As it turned out , my parents did not disown me . I found out later that they were hoping it was a phase that I would grow out of . By the time they had decided it was n't a phase , they were sort of used to it . They did n't disown me but they did n't completely accept the situation either . For example , they did n't come to my wedding because it was in a church . When I visited my grandmother in the hospital a few days before her death , she said to me , `` As far as I 'm concerned , you still are a Jew . '' What she meant was that she loved me and forgave me . But I am not a Jew . I am a Christian . ( I 'll concede , one that likes chicken soup with matzoh balls . : - ) ) I do not keep kosher . I do not celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday . My sons are not circumcised . But these things are true of some people who do consider themselves Jews . It is not these rules that make people Jews ; it is the heritage from the past . I gave up the past . This is why I find it hard to relate to Messianic Jews . Their experience is unlike mine . They still consider themselves Jews while following Jesus . Some would even say that I *must* do so , too . I am at a stage of my life now where I would like to have a heritage . It was not something I valued very much when I gave it . But I did have a sense that I was giving it for God . It may have been a small sacrifice . It may have been an unnecessary sacrifice . But I gave it and do not want to ask for it back . And while I do n't have the heritage I was born with , I do have another . I am an outcast from the house of Israel , but I am a member of the Church . One of the things I like about being a Catholic Christian is that it is rich in tradition . It gives me a feeling of , once again , being rooted in the past . This is probably one of the reasons why I do n't like it when people mess around with Christian traditions ( for example , changing the name of Easter ) . These traditions fill an important emotional need of mine . I suppose the point of all this is that people should n't assume that all believers of Jewish background are the same . For some ` Jewish Christian ' is a good name , for others it is an oxymoron . Jayne Kulikauskas/jayen @ mmalt.guild.org

First , it will not pass a National Electrical code inspection . Secondly , The neutral wire is current carrying and the ground wire should n't be , or only during a fault condition . The reason the neutral and ground are tied together in the panel is the tranformer on the power pole has a grounded center-tap secondary , with the grounded center-tap the neutral . This gives 120v to neutral ( ground ) from each side of the transformer and 240v across the transformer . So in effect the neutral and ground should be at the same potential . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Mark E.

Khomeini put a price on the head of someone in another country , this makes him a jerk as well as an international outlaw . Khomeini advocates the view that there was a series of twelve Islamic leaders ( the Twelve Imams ) who are free of error or sin . This makes him a heretic . In the Qur'an Muhammad is chastised for error directly by God ; the Qur'an says that Muhammad is the greatest example of proper Islamic behavior ; thus no muslim is free from error . > As usual there seems to be almost as many Islamic viewpoints as there > are Muslims . Perhaps it seems so to you , but this is hardly the case . There is widespread agreement about matters of Islam . There certainly are many viewpoints on issues which are not particularly Islamic in and of themselves , but this is so for any large group of people under the same name . > It all comes back to the Koran being so imprecise in its wording . The Qur'an is not particularly imprecise in wording , though it is true that several interpretations are possible in the interpretations of many words . However , as an entire text the Qur'an makes its meanings precise enough for intelligent people free from power lust to come to agreement about them . Gregg

I disagree . People marry each other . When they commit fully to each other as life partners , they are married . The ceremony may assist in emphasizing the depth of such a commitment , but is of itself nothing . God knows our hearts . He knows when two have committed themselves to be one , he knows the fears and delusions we have that keep us from fully giving ourselves to another . The way I see it , you 'd have to be living together in a marriage for somewhere between 10 and 100 years before anyone knew if a marriage really existed , but God knows .

The argument for Luke 's genealogy being that of Mary is very weak . According to Luke 3:23 And when he began his ministry , Jesus himself was about thirty years of age , being supposedly the son of Joseph , the son of Eli , Aside from the fact that Mary is not mentioned , there are two possible interpretations : either Joseph was her father or he was her brother . Clearly this is not acceptable . A third would be that Joseph , the son of Eli , was her Father and just happened to have the name as the man to whom she was betrothed . But that would seem to be grasping at straws . The most straightforward interpretation is that Luke had no intention of tracing Mary 's genealogy ( in which case he would have named her ) but that he traces her husband 's , from David 's son Nathan . The Matthew descendant list most definitely traces down from David's son , Solomon , to Joseph . Matthew 1:16 reads : And to Jacob was born Joseph , the husband of Mary , by whom was born Jesus , who is called Christ . There are two apparent problems . The first is , how to reconcile the two paternal genealogies - which diverge with the sons of David , Solomon and Nathan . The second is , why is any genealogy of Joseph relavent at all , if Joseph had nothing to do with it . If Joseph was not Jesus 's physical father , then the original poster is quite correct , that claims for Jesus 's messianic heritage are not based on truth but only on appearances , whatever Jesus 's divine nature was . The second problem is easy , in my mind . We assume that Joseph was not involved in the conception of Jesus in any way . However , a Holy Spirit capable of working a physical conception in Mary is also capable of employing the physical agency of Joseph 's seed in this work . In our materialistic times we interpret viginity and its loss solely in terms of a physical act , whereas it is really a matter of purity on a much higher level as well . The important thing is that neither Mary nor Joseph was conscious of any union between them ( they had not `` known '' each other ) . Thus the first gospel 's dedication of half its opening chapter to the genealogy of Joseph is quite relevant to Jesus , the Virgin birth not- withstanding . To the first question there is an answer that creates , to begin with , more problems than it resolves . It is that the two evangelists are relating the births of two entirely different children of two entirely different sets of parents . Except for the names of the parents and the child , and the birthplace in Bethlehem there is no point in common between the two stories . Matthew and Luke converge in their accounts only thirty years later with the Baptism of Jesus in Jordan . Rudolf Steiner offered his explanation of how these accounts begin with two children and then converge with their accounts of the one Jesus of Nazareth . He did not derive his resolution from biblical study or speculation , or from other external documents , and the discussion of `` how this could be '' might bring us beyond the limits of appropriateness for this newsgroup . In any case , the details are described in Steiner 's `` The Spiritual Guidance of the Human Being and of Humanity '' , `` The Gospel of St. Luke '' , and `` The Gospel of St. Matthew '' . Whether or not Rudolf Steiner 's methods and explanation are accepted as valid , at least this interpretation resolves the apparent contradictions of the two genealogies while leaving the text intact . As for the passing of one 's Jewishness through the mother , this was never an issue with Jesus . No one ever questioned his or Mary's Jewishness . The issue of the genealogies has to do with his paternal line of descent from David , the king . Gerry Palo ( 73237.2006 @ compuserve.com )

You raise a valid point , but again it 's a tradeoff -- how much money do you want to spend for that kind of protection ? You could buy a Volvo , Saab , or 'Benz and get really good crash protection ( and other luxuries ) but you 'll pay significantly more for it . In my case it's out of the question because *all* of those cars are beyond my budget . Even in high-speed head-on collisions the most beneficial item you can have is a good old 3-point seatbelt .

Rutin is a bioflavonoid , compounds found ( among other places ) in the rinds of citrus fruits .

The studies which attempted to look at the effect of these compounds in human disease and nutrition were never very well controlled , so the reports of positive results with them is mostly anecdotal .

This is because it 's like te PC AT hard disk interface . The controller moves a sector to some buffer memory on the controller card , then the CPU moves the data from the buffer to main memory where it 's needed . If IDE does n't work this way , then it 's not compatible . Heck , if IDE used DMA , then you 'd hear all kinds of complaints about ISA bus systems with more than 16M RAM not working with their IDE drives . 16M is the DMA addressing limit of the ISA bus , and if IDE did DMA there would be trouble . ( BTW , there are DMA-enabling signals in the IDE cable spec , but the last report I heard was that they are never implemented , because it would require a different kind of IDE adapter and different drivers . ) -- Richard Krehbiel richk @ grebyn.com OS/2 2.0 will do for me until AmigaDOS for the 386 comes along ...

There is much to grieve . > > randy Very interesting , but I also believe that you have presented a misleading argument . Christianity is not the cause of the massacres and horrific injustices that you relate , rather they are the fault of people who misunderstand Jesus Christ 's message , and modify it to suit their own beliefs and aims , rather than alter their ambitions to be more in line with those presented as desirable in the New Testament . With every truthful and good message that carries authority or implied authority , comes the inevitable fact that some ( many ? ) people will understand it in a distorted way , with inevitable consequences . The Bible 's message is that we are to love all people , and that all people are redeemable . It preaches a message of repentance , and of giving . Unfortunately , all people have deceitful hearts , and are capable of turning this message around and contorting it in sometimes unbelievable ways . This is also a fundamental Christian doctrine . One of the problems is that you look at the world through the eyes of Western history . I think that you will find many , many cases of massacres that were instigated by people who never claimed they were Christian . I am not saying this to justify the massacres that were , but I am merely pointing you to a tendency which is present in humans already . Consider the world without Christianity . I doubt that we would have the same freedoms in the countries in which we live , if it was n't for the peaceful doctrines of Jesus Christ . Perhaps we would even be confronted by a very harsh religion ( I wo n't name any here , though one comes to mind ) which would not even allow us the freedom of speech to debate such subjects . Point the blame at inherent human tendencies of thirst for power , greed and hatred . Please do n't point the blame at a message which preaches fundamental giving and denial , in love for others . Yours in Christ , Andrew McVeigh p.s . I believe that a line of questioning like you presented is , strangely enough , compatible with becoming a Christian . Certainly Christianity encourages one to question the behaviour of the world , and especially Christians . I praise God for Jesus Christ , and the fact that we can doubt our beliefs and still come back to God and be forgiven , time and time again . -- ***** Andrew McVeigh

Most of the accusations and fabrications about Shi'ites come out of Saudi Arabia from the Wahabis . For that matter you should read the original works of the Sunni Imams ( Imams of the four madhabs ) . The teacher of at least two of them was Imam Jafar Sadiq ( the sixth Imam of the Shi'ites ) . Although there is plenty of false propaganda floating around about the Shi'ites ( esp . since the revolution ) , there are also many good works by Shi'ites which present the views and teachings of their school . Why make assumptions and allegations ( like people in this group have done about Islam in general ) about Shi'ites .

How is it transmitted ? > How does it work ( ie . how does it kill so quickly ) ? There are many organisms , viral , bacterial , and fungal , which can cause meningitits , and the course of these infections varies widely . The causes of bacterial meningitis vary with age : in adults pneumococcus ( the same organism which causes pneumococcal pneumonia ) is the most common cause , while in children Hemophilus influenzae is the most common cause . What you are describing is meningitis from Neisseria meningitidis , which is the second most common cause of bacterial meningitis in both groups , but with lower incidence in infants . This organism is also called the `` meningococcus '' , and is the source of the common epidemics of meningitis that occur and are popularized in the press . Without prompt treatment ( and even WITH it in some cases ) , the organism typically causes death within a day . This organism , feared as it is , is actually grown from the throats of many normal adults . It can get to the meninges by different ways , but blood borne spread is probably the usual case . Rifampin ( an oral antibiotic ) is often given to family and contacts of a case of meningococcal meningitis , by the way . Sorry , but I do n't have time for a more detailed reply . Meningitis is a huge topic , and sci.med ca n't do it justice . -km

We Catholics do believe that God 's revealed truth that is not explicitly recorded in the Bible can be and is passed on through the Tradition of the Church . It should be noted that the Tradition of the Church , otherwise known as Sacred Tradition , is not the same as ordinary human traditions . However , we do not believe that additional truth will be revealed to the Church . Public revelation , which is the basis of Catholic doctrine , ended with the death of St. John , the last Apostle . Nothing new can be added . Theologians study this revelation and can draw out implications that were not recognized previously , so that the Council of Nicea could define statements about the theology of the Trinity and the Incarnation that were not explicitly stated in the Bible and had been disputed before the council , but there was no new revelation at Nicea or at any subsequent council . Cardinal Newman 's _An Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine_ , written while he was still an Anglican , is an excellent discussion of of this point .

[ HE ] Homeland ? First Nagarno-Karabagh was Armenians homeland today [ HE ] Fizuli , Lacin and several villages ( in Azerbadjan ) [ HE ] are their homeland . Ca n't you see the [ HE ] the `` Great Armenia '' dream in this ? Greater Armenia would stretch from Karabakh , to the Black Sea , to the Mediterranean , so if you use the term `` Greater Armenia '' use it with care . [ HE ] With facist methods like [ HE ] killing , raping and bombing villages . The last move was the [ HE ] blast of a truck with 60 kurdish refugees , trying to [ HE ] escape the from Lacin , a city that was `` given '' to the Kurds [ HE ] by the Armenians . It has always been up to the Azeris to end their announced winning of Karabakh by removing the Armenians ! When the president of Azerbaijan , Elchibey , came to power last year , he announced he would be be `` swimming in Lake Sevan [ in Armeniaxn ] by July '' . Well , he was wrong ! If Elchibey is going to shell the Armenians of Karabakh from Aghdam , his people will pay the price ! If Elchibey is going to shell Karabakh from Fizuli his people will pay the price ! If Elchibey thinks he can get away with bombing Armenia from the hills of Kelbajar , his people will pay the price . It also seems other non-Azeri minorities in Azerbaijan have understood they are next in line in this process of forced Azerification or deportation . Just look at the situation with the Lezgians . About the Kurds ... what Kurds ! According to the Azerbaijani government , there are no Kurds in Azerbaijan . Ca n't they make up their minds ? Oh I see , there are only Kurds when the Azeris want them to be Kurds ! And anyway , this `` 60 Kurd refugee '' story , as have other stories , are simple fabrications sourced in Baku , modified in Ankara . Other examples of this are Armenia has no border with Iran , and the ridiculous story of the `` intercepting '' of Armenian military conversations as appeared in the New York Times supposedly translated by somebody unknown , from Armenian into Azeri Turkish , submitted by an unnamed '' special correspondent '' to the NY Times from Baku . Real accurate ! [ h ] However , I hope that the Armenians WILL force a TURKISH airplane [ h ] to LAND for purposes of SEARCHING for ARMS similar to the one [ h ] that happened last SUMMER . Turkey searched an AMERICAN plane [ h ] ( carrying humanitarian aid ) bound to ARMENIA . [ h ] No , Henrik , these Turkish planes should be shot down with no questions asked . [ HE ] Do n't speak about things you do n't know : 8 American Cargo planes [ HE ] were heading to Armenia . When the Turkish authorities [ HE ] announced that they were going to search these cargo [ HE ] planes 3 of these planes returned to it 's base in Germany . [ HE ] 5 of these planes were searched in Turkey . The content of [ HE ] of the other 3 planes ? Not hard to guess , is it ? It was sure not [ HE ] humanitarian aid ... .. Your `` facts '' in error . Shipments of all kinds that have transversed Turkey have been either searched , re-routed or confiscated . Some American planes were searched , others were re-routed , others were untouched . Rail shipments were held up last fall and last winter from entering Armenian from Turkey for the purpose of aiding in the economic collapse of Armenia . Wheat was confiscated , other shipments were exchanged with `` crap '' and dirt , then shipped to Armenia . U.S. planes do n't have to use Turkish air bases . The U.S. uses these bases to bomb Iraq . Anyway , U.S. planes can fly over Georgia , which they have found is easier than to endure unnecessary expressions of Turkish chauvinism through searches of cargo which to this day have not revealed anything other than a paranoid Turkish military . [ HE ] Search Turkish planes ? You do n't know what you are talking about . [ HE ] since it 's content is announced to be weapons ? Well , big mouth Ozal said military weapons are being provided to Azerbaijan from Turkey , yet Demirel and others say no . No wonder you are so confused ! [ HE ] Turkey 's government has announced that it 's giving weapons [ HE ] to Azerbadjan since Armenia started to attack Azerbadjan [ HE ] it self , not the Karabag province . So why search a plane for weapons [ HE ] since it 's content is announced to be weapons ? You are correct , all Turkish planes should be simply shot down !

Because you 've never heard of it , its dead ? The fact is , you claimed Israel had to give arabs rights because of ( non-existant ) International aid . Then you see that that argument has a hole you could drive a truck through , and again assert that Israel is only democratic within the ( unexplained ) constraints of one ethnic group . The problem with that argument is that Arabs are allowed to vote for whoever they please . So , please tell me , Sam , what constraints are there on Israeli democracy that do n't exist in other democratic states ? I 've never heard anything about the Khazakistani arab population . Does that mean that they have no history or roots ? When I was at Ben Gurion university in Israel , one of my neighbors was an Israeli arab . He was n't really all that different from my other neighbors . Does that make him dead or oppressed ? > I stand corrected .

Even still , if the contest participants had to fund DC-1 development , it probably would n't be worth it to develop DC-1 ( just for the contest ) . Just give me the cheapest heaviest lift man rated ( or at least under 6 or so Gs ) booster ... If I do n't have to pay for DC-1 development , great ! , I 'll use it . But back to the contest goals , there was a recent article in AW & ST about a low cost ( it 's all relative ... ) manned return to the moon . A General Dynamics scheme involving a Titan IV & Shuttle to lift a Centaur upper stage , LEV , and crew capsule . The mission consists of delivering two unmanned payloads to the lunar surface , followed by a manned mission . Total cost : US was $ 10- $ 13 billion . Joint ESA ( ? ) /NASA project was $ 6- $ 9 billion for the US share . I did n't find a mention of how long the crew could stay , but I 'd bet that its around 30 days . And the total payload delivered was about 30 metric tonnes . So if you ignore the scientific payload , hitch a ride in the crew habitation module ( no return trip ... ) , and toss in a few more tonnes for the additional consumables to last another 11 months , then you *might* be able to get a year visit out of 15 tonnes ( and in case its not obvious , that 's a wild ass guess ) . A pretty boring visit , since every trip outdoors eats up a bit of LOX . And I 'm not certain if a home brewed ( or college-brewed ) life support system could last a year . But let 's round this up to 19.4 tonnes ( convient , since the GD plan talks about 9.7 ton payloads delivered to the lunar surface . This adds up to two Centaurs , two LEVs , two Shuttle flights ... All to put a single man on the moon for a year . Hmmm . Not really practical . Anyone got a cheaper/better way of delivering 15-20 tonnes to the lunar surface within the decade ? Anyone have a more precise guess about how much a year 's supply of consumables and equipment would weigh ? And I was wondering about the GD LEV . Is it reusable ? Or is it discarded to burn up on return to LEO ? If its not discarded , could it be refueled ? Henry : Do you know anything about the GD LEV ? I noted that it uses RL-10 engines . Are n't they reusable/restartable ? Would a LEV fit in a DC-1 ? I 've forgotten ( if I ever knew ) what the cargo bay dimensions are for the DC-1 . All in all , I 'm not certain that the single goal/prize of staying on the moon for a year is wise and/or useful . How about : A prize for the first non-government sponsered unmanned moon landing , then another for a manned moon landing , then yet another for a system to extract consumables from lunar soil , another for a reusable earth/moon shuttle , and so forth . Find some way to build civilian moonbase infrastructure ... Having a single goal might result in a bunch of contestents giving up after one person appeared to win . And for those that did n't give up , I find something a little scary about a half dozen people huddling in rickety little moon shelters . I'd like to see as much a reward for co-operation as for competition . Lastly , about ten or fifteen years back I seem to recall that there was an English space magazine that had an on-going discussion about moonbases on the cheap . I recalled it discussed things like how much heat the human body produced , how much lunar material it 'd need for protection from solar flares , etc . Unfortunately I do n't remember the name of this magazine . Does this ring a bell to anyone ?

I think it is ; I 've heard it 's not . Lets > say 8 bit samples . Would *raw* data at the corresponding sampling rate > be usable ? If not , how fancy does the compression need to be ? A good vocoder like ours will give you 8000 bits per second locked at full rate ( it 's a variable rate voice activity vocoder ) . If you want less quality , cut that to 4000 bps ( half rate ) . At full rate variable you could put two full-duplex conversations on a V.32bis modem . This requires a DSP or ASICs , though . An RS-6000 has a CPU that could probably do it in real-time , because it has the add-and-multiply instruction and a few other DSP things . If you want to do speech in real-time you need about 4000 samples a second ( for not very good voice ) with your 8 bit samples ( ISDN is 8000 8-bit samples a second ) , which is 32 kbps . You could do a fast 2:1 compression on that to get it down to 16 kbps , which is just about V.32bis . The quality at this point is very bleah , but it should work . Now add in the time for your encryption method . You 're going to need sampling hardware , which is no problem on a new Mac , an Amiga . Or a PC with a SoundBlaster card ( just because they 're so popular and cheap - you could also build a simple ADC ) . The problem with the SoundBlaster is that it does n't seem to be full duplex - you can't sample and play backq at the same time , making a two-way conversation a bit tough . The special hardware or a more capable sound card may be required . The only thing that worries me is that 2:1 compression - the SoundBlaster can do it automatically in hardware , but other than that I do n't have a good feel for how processor intensive it is , so I can't estimate how fast a PC you 'd need . -- Not all men who drink are poets .

Dec. 1989 Leading Israeli author and cultural commentator , A.B . Yehoshua , launched a ferocious attack on diaspora Jewry at a Zionist Youth Council meeting in North London , last week . The diaspora , he claimed , `` was the cancer connected to the main tissue of the Jewish people '' . He was scathing about its failure to act before the Holocaust . He said the diaspora 's religious and secular leadership had ignored the warning signs in the 1920s , and had fiercely opposed Zionism . Consequently , he considered the Holocaust , `` the failure of Judaism '' . His talk , entitled `` Diaspora : A Neurotic Solution '' , covered 5,000 years of Jewish history . Mr. Yehoshua 's other targets included Soviet Jews who were , he said `` not staying [ in Israel ] , but running [ away ] '' , and all Jews outside Israel `` who were using other people 's countries like hotels '' . The only conclusion he could draw was that the diaspora was immoral , because it looked to Israel for its identity but lived elsewhere . Worse , it threatened Israel itself , creating a distraction for her citizens , who were leaving by the thousands . Mr. Yehoshua , who described himself as `` a soldier for aliyah '' , ended by calling for the creation of a new `` total Jew '' , living in Israel . Earlier , speaking at a meeting of Jewish students on the difficulties of forging a national identity in Israeli literature , Mr. Yehoshua claimed that Israeli writers were paralyzed by the country 's political situation . He said Israel 's wars had once provided writers with a vital source of inspiration . Today , Israeli writers avoided writing directly about the Arab-Israeli conflict . No major work had been produced about the intifada . Instead , writers were tackling themes such as Jewish identity , emigration from Israel and personal and family issues . Mr. Yehoshua admitted he also felt unable to write about the Israeli political situation . He could no longer step into an Israeli Arab 's shoes and portray him as a real `` flesh and blood character '' . He claimed that after 40 years of statehood , the problem of Israeli identity had not been solved . He said Jews remained too pre-occupied with the borders of identity between Jew and non-Jew , and were not concerned with the nature of that identity . Jewish values in Israel embraced every aspect of daily life , unlike in the diaspora , where Jews had no responsibility for the country they lived in , he said . He warned that modern Hebrew , a unifying force for the Jewish people , would have to struggle for its future , especially in literary circles . It faced fierce competition from the English language . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -

Pardon me ? `` Greece Government Rail-Roads Two Turkish Ethnic Deputies '' While World Human Rights Organizations Scream , Greeks Persistently Work on Removing the Parliamentary Immunity of Dr. Sadik Ahmet and Mr. Ahmet Faikoglu . Dr. Sadik Ahmet , Turkish Ethnic Member of Greek Parliament , Visits US Washington DC , July 7- Doctor Sadik Ahmet , one of the two ethnic Turkish members of the Greek parliament visited US on june 24 through July 5th and held meetings with human rights organizations and high-level US officials in Washington DC and New York . At his press conference at the National Press Club in Washington DC , Sadik Ahmet explained the plight of ethnic Turks in Greece and stated six demands from Greek government . Ahmet said `` our only hope in Greece is the pressure generated from Western capitals for insisting that Greece respects the human rights . What we are having done to ethnic Turks in Greece is exactly the same as South African Apartheid . '' He added : `` What we are facing is pure Greek hatred and racial discrimination . '' Spelling out the demands of the Turkish ethnic community in Greece he said `` We want the restoration of Greek citizenship of 544 ethnic Turks . Their citizenship was revoked by using the excuse that this people have stayed out of Greece for too long . They are Greek citizens and are residing in Greece , even one of them is actively serving in the Greek army . Besides , other non-Turkish citizens of Greece are not subject to this kind of interpretation at an extent that many of Greek-Americans have Greek citizenship and they permanently live in the United States . '' `` We want guarantee for Turkish minority 's equal rights . We want Greek government to accept the Turkish minority and grant us our civil rights . Our people are waiting since 25 years to get driving licenses . The Greek government is not granting building permits to Turks for renovating our buildings or building new ones . If your name is Turkish , you are not hired to the government offices . '' `` Furthermore , we want Greek government to give us equal opportunity in business . They do not grant licenses so we can participate in the economic life of Greece . In my case , they denied me a medical license necessary for practicing surgery in Greek hospitals despite the fact that I have finished a Greek medical school and followed all the necessary steps in my career . '' `` We want freedom of expression for ethnic Turks . We are not allowed to call ourselves Turks . I myself have been subject of a number of law suits and even have been imprisoned just because I called myself a Turk . '' `` We also want Greek government to provide freedom of religion . '' In separate interview with The Turkish Times , Dr. Sadik Ahmet stated that the conditions of ethnic Turks are deplorable and in the eyes of Greek laws , ethnic Greeks are more equal than ethnic Turks . As an example , he said there are about 20,000 telephone subscribers in Selanik ( Thessaloniki ) and only about 800 of them are Turks . That is not because Turks do not want to have telephone services at their home and businesses . He said that Greek government changed the election law just to keep him out of the parliament as an independent representative and they stated this fact openly to him . While there is no minimum qualification requirement for parties in terms of receiving at least 3 % of the votes , they imposed this requirement for the independent parties , including the Turkish candidates . Ahmet was born in a small village at Gumulcine ( Komotini ) , Greece 1947 . He earned his medical degree at University of Thessaloniki in 1974. he served in the Greek military as an infantryman . In 1985 he got involved with community affairs for the first time by collecting 15,000 signatures to protest the unjust implementation of laws against ethnic Turks . In 1986 , he was arrested by the police for collecting signatures .

The kit is for an already existing Laserwriter IINTX . It is a ROM upgrade that replaces the font rasterizer code with the more efficient , speedier code that first became available in Adobe Type Manager 1.0 .

The older models are VERY well built . Unless Toyota lost its mind , I would assume , until proven otherwise , that the newer models have inherited some if not all of the qualities of their ancestors . Two major differences in the running gear ( that I 'm aware of ) need study . My '79 has a solid front axle housing whereas the newer models have independant front suspension . The solid axle is theoretically stronger and more reliable than the newer model , but only experience will tell . The independant front suspension is , no doubt , a compromise made to satisfy the typical user , who will never need a real utility vehicle . The second difference is the type of transfer case used on the newer models . I'm not sure , but I think Tioyota went to a full-time 4WD or all-wheel drive system . The older Landcruisers have a `` lock-up '' type . Both have their advantages and disadvantages . Paul Hovnanian hovnania @ atc.boeing.com [ Std disclaimers apply ]

This is > an issue that may be very personal , but is important . What does > the Bible say about this and how can we encourage our friends with > regard to this issue ? This brings up an interesting subject that has not been discussed much , and probably has not been studied much . As some of you may be aware , I 've posted a lot of articles lately on personality typing ( of which the MBTI is a test vehicle ) . To come up to speed , just read 'alt.psychology.personality ' and/or ask for by personality type summary file . One observation is that people have significantly different personalities ( no question on this ) which seem to be essentially in-born . With respect to church attendance and participation , some people thrive on this , while other people have real difficulty with this because they prefer a more solitary and contemplative lifestyle - that is , they are de-energized if confronted with excessive closeness to outside activities and lots of people . Of course this is measured by extroversion/introversion . My impression is that many churches are totally blind to this fact , and create environments that 'scare away ' many who are naturally introverted ( there are many introverted characters in the Bible , btw ) . I know , I am quite introverted in preference , and find the 'pressure ' by many churches to participate , to meet together in large groups , etc. , to be very uncomfortable . Knowing what I know now , these churches have been overly influenced by highly extroverted people who thrive on this sort of thing . ( BTW , there 's nothing wrong with either extroversion or introversion , both preferences have their place in the Body ) . Maybe I should define extrovert/introvert more carefully since these words are usually not used correctly in our culture . The extrovert/introvert scale is a measure of how a person is energized . The following is excerpted from my summary : 1 . Energizing - How a person is energized : Extroversion ( E ) - Preference for drawing energy from the outside world of people , activities or things . Introversion ( I ) - Preference for drawing energy from one 's internal world of ideas , emotions , or impressions . Hopefully this will elicit further discussion as to how churches can structure themselves to meet the real needs of the people who comprise the Body of Christ , instead of trying to change people 's personalities to fit them into a particular framework . I 'm sure there are other aspects of how churches have not properly understood personality variances among their members to the detriment of all . Jon Noring -- Charter Member -- - > > > INFJ Club .

Yep , they seem sooo effective . Sure . Well , they have n't managed to outlaw abortion due to the possible objectivity of the courts .

Well , I am not clear on the religious convictions of Francis Scott Key ( the motto can be attributed to him ) , but it is at least clear that he believed in a god .

That is to say , the religion of this country , and the non-religion of the USSR . That was what most of those quotes were about , and some included all atheists , in general , as well . I do n't think that any of the quotes ( although I seem to have lost them ) mentioned anything at all about Jesus . They advocated religion over non-religion . A specific religion was not mentioned . > > You have missed this point . I said that the motto did n't say anything > > about anyone in particular .

From : brad @ clarinet.com ( Brad Templeton ) Subject : Once tapped , your code is no good any more . Distribution : na Organization : ClariNet Communications Corp. Lines : 22 It occurs to me that if they get a wiretap order on you , and the escrow houses release your code to the cops , your code is now no longer secure . It 's in the hands of cops , and while I am sure most of the time they are good , their security will not be as good as the escrow houses . What this effectively means is that if they perform a wiretap on you , at the end of the wiretap , they should be obligated to inform you that a tap was performed , and replace ( for free ) the clipper chip in your cellular phone so that it is once again a code known only to the escrow houses . Do the police normally reveal every tap they do even if no charges are laid ? In many ways , it would be a positive step if they had to . Judges set time limits on warrants , I assume . At the end of the time limit they should have to renew or replace your chip . That 's if we go with this scheme , which I am not sure I agree with . -- Brad Templeton , ClariNet Communications Corp. -- Sunnyvale , CA 408/296-0366

The only thing > that I know about a Glock is the lack of a real safety on it . Sure there is > that little thing in the trigger but that is n't too great of a safety . You 're getting warmer . The 'little thing in the trigger ' has to be depressed before the trigger can move . What this means is the damned thing wo n't go off until the trigger is pulled . This makes it just about ( there HAVE been some problems , but we 're assuming the gun is functioning correctly.. ) as safe as a revolver . The gun when working correctly is totally drop safe . Now , in police work this is a consideration . There is not a single documented case I 'm aware of where a police officer was killed because he failed to operate the safety on his firearm . There are quite a few documented cases where criminals got hold of the cops gun and couldn't figure out how to get the safety off in time to use the gun , thus the proprietary nature of the safety ( to the criminal at least ) very likely prevented the office from getting shot . The purpose of a safety is to make the gun safe from unintentional fire . This does not mean it should be so complicated as to slow down intentional use ! Thus the Glock safety is perfectly adequate from a 'safety ' standpoint , but not necessarily the most desirable from the standpoint of open carry where it is easily grabbed by somebody else . By this criteria it DOES make a lot of sense as a concealed carry piece . From the standpoint of police use , it is no better ( or worse ) than a revolver as far as being 'proprietary ' to the officer in the method of firing it . The ideal solution may someday be biometric sensing of the user so that the firearm ca n't be used by anybody but it 's owner , but for now the wide variety of safety systems helps , unless the criminal happens to be familiar with that particular type of firearm .

The term arrhythmia is usually used to encompass a wide range of abnormal heart rhythms ( cardiac dysrhythmias ) . Some of them are very serious while others are completely benign . Having `` a few irregular beats '' on an EKG could be serious depending on what those beats were and when they occurred , or could be of no significance . Low blood potassium levels probably predispose people with underlying heart disease to develop arrhythmias . Very low potassium levels are clearly dangerous , but it is not clear how much of a problem low-end-of-normal levels are : a lot of cardiologists seem to treat anyone with even a mildly low-normal potassium level . -- David Rind rind @ enterprise.bih.harvard.edu

Burleigh Grimes went from 20+ wins and an ERA of 3 or so in '24 to 13-19 and an ERA around 4 in '25 . He pitched well for several more years .

If I recall , he had a 4.50 ERA in the 1st half and a 3.50 ERA in the 2nd half of last year . Hmmm , 21 runs in 11 innings . Suppose he starts 30 more games , and winds up w/200 innings pitched .

My 1st hunch is that Morris is very gutsy , and that he may be pitching through an injury and not telling anyone . My 2nd guess is that he will be banished to the bullpen the remainder of the season after a few more starts . ( Perhaps when Stewart comes off the DL ? Or will Danny Cox , who went 3 or 4 scoreless innings against the Tribe today , start for Morris ? He looks like a really good one . Gaston is scrambling to find starters , I 'd imagine . Luckily , the Jays have a very good offense . ) I do n't think they would dare release him before the end of the year .

This would be a reversal of the 1948 situation in which the Jews in Palestine took control of the land and its ( mostly Muslim ) inhabitants . However , whoever committed crimes against humanity ( torture , blowing up their homes , murders , ... ) must be treated and tried as a war criminal . The political thought of these movements shows that a freedom of choice will be given to the Jews in living under the new law or leaving to the destintion of their choice . As for the PLO , I am at a loss to explain what is going inside Arafat 's mind . Although their political thinking seems far fetched with Israel acting as a true super-power in the region , the Islamic movements are using the same weapon the Jews used to establish their state : Religion .

Access time is , of course , somewhat important , but not as vital in the case of CDs as data transfer rate . All the drives are double-speed drives with maximum data transfer rates of 300K/second . Any is a good choice . Apple 's is very cheap when included with new Macs and I agree with Christian 's comment about drivers . Plus , Apple 's is bootable on the Centris and Quadra 800 . A very nice feature if you need to install System software . I do n't know if the NEC or Toshiba are bootable on those machines . Mark

Actually , there are people who will tell you that it *would* be enough to do SSTO development , if done privately as a cut-rate operation . Of course , they may be over-optimistic .

From : simon @ giaeb.cc.monash.edu.au Subject : St. Maria Goretti Organization : Monash University , Melb. , Australia . Lines : 125 Heres the life of St. MAria Goretti , posted with kind permission of the editor of the Australian Catholic Magazine `` Morning Star '' . Hope you like it . Put up with anything to prevent sin St. Maria Goretti Maria was born on October 16th 1890 to Luigi and Assunta Goretti , the eldest daughter in the family of seven . She was a cheerful girl , always imitating her parents . She had but one disire , but one wish : to receive our Lord in the Blessed Sacrament . The date was finally set for little Maria to receive our Lord on the feast of Corpus Christi . For Maria , time seemed like an eter- nity as she slowly neared the great day . When it finally arrived , Fr . Jerome ( the priest who was to celebrate the Mass and give the children their First Holy Communion ) delivered a sermon on the immense love of Jesus Christ for them and the great love we should have in return for Him . He then warmly urged them to die rather than commit a mortal sin . Maria humbly approached the Altar of God and received the Holy Eucharist . Her only sadness was the thought of her father's absence , who died some time beforehand . As for the rest of the day , Maria remained under the spell of the divine visit ; that is until -4- her thoughts changed to when she could go next to Holy Communion . Thus ended the happiest day of Maria 's life . Over the next twelve months , Maria had changed from a giggling little girl into a quiet young lady with responsibilities . As her mother went out into the fields in place of her husband , Maria took on the ironing , cooking , washing and other motherly duties . She was doing this not only for her own family , but also for the Serenellis , a father and son who lived with the Goretti 's , owning a share in the farm . Although Maria was poorer than all the other children , she by far surpassed them in virtue . In all thi ngs she did the Holy Will of God . During the month of June , Alessandro Serenelli ( the son ) twice made advances upon Maria when he chanced to be alone with her . On both occasions Maria managed to struggle free of Alessandro's strong grip , but on the second , he threatened to kill her if she even uttered a word to her mother . From this day on , Maria lived in terror , fearing lest Alessandro attack again . On July 5th 1902 , Alessandro left work in the fields to `` get a handkerchief , '' as he claimed . He went to the storeroom beneath the house where Maria , who was outside on the landing with the baby , could hear him fumbling about in with tools . She wondered what he was doing . It was later learned that he was sharpening a 91/2 '' blade . He went to the house and called for Maria . She told him she would n't go to him unless she knew why she was needed . He stormed out to the landing and dragged her up to her room . Mar ia instantly realized what he was up to . `` No , No , No ! Do not touch me ! It is a sin , you will go to Hell ! '' At this point Alessandro held the knife over Maria 's chest , who was now on the floor . `` Will you or will you not ? '' Maria gathered all her energy . `` No I will not , Alessandro , no ! '' She had chosen her martyrdom over sin , God over Satan . Overcome with rage , Alessandro plunged the knife into Maria 's breast fourteen times . Finally he came to his senses and thought Maria was dead . Frantically he threw the knife behind a closet and locked himself in his room . The crying of the baby Teresa on the landing brought the attention to Assunta and the father of Alessandro . As the baby was unattended and was in danger of falling off , they ran to the house to find Maria , who , covered in blood , was dragging herself to the door . When asked what happened she said Alessandro stabbed her . `` He wanted to make me do wrong and I would not . '' The ambulance arrived , then the police who took Alessandro away . As the ambulance carried Maria to the hospital , a large crowd followed on foot . The doctors at the hospital held no hope for poor little Maria . The same Fr . Jerome who gave Maria her First Communion -5- came to administer the last rites and to give her Holy Viaticum . He asked Maria if she would forgive her murderer . `` Yes . For the love of Jesus I forgive him . I wish for him to one day join me in Paradise . May God forgive him , for I alread y have . '' Maria died at about three o'clock . Alessandro was tried and found guilty of Maria 's death but because of his age he was sentenced to only thirty years in prison . After eight years of being a violent prisoner and show- ing no regret for his crime , he saw in a dream , in the midst of a field of flowers , Maria holding out a bunch of white lilies to him . Soon later he wrote to the local bishop , begging God 's par- don for the grave sin he had committed . He later gave testimony in Maria 's beatification in 1947 . Less than three years later , on Ju ne 24th 1950 , Maria was canonised . Assunta Goretti was the first mother ever to be present at her daughter 's canonisation . May St. Maria Goretti help us to be pure and grant us the strength to die rather than commit a mortal sin . Saint Maria Goretti , pray for us . by Brendan Arthur -- Internet : simon @ giaeb.cc.monash.edu.au Viva Cristo Rey ! ! Long Live Christ the King .

The first is that of Israel , where there is little trust for Arab groups , so there is little support for Israel giving up **tangible** assets in exchange for pieces of paper , `` expectations '' , `` hopes '' , etc . The second is that of the Arab world/Palestinians , where there is the demand that these `` tangible concessions '' be made by Israel **without** it receiving anything **tangible** back . Given this , the gap between the two stances seems to be the need by Israel of receiving some ***tangible*** returns for its expected concessions . By `` tangible '' is meant something that 1 ) provides Israel with `` comparable '' protection ( from the land it is to give up ) , 2 ) in some way ensures that the Arab states and Palestine **will be** accountable and held actively ( not just `` diplomatically ) responsible for the upholding of all actions on its territory ( by citizens or `` visitors '' ) . In essence I do not believe that Israel objections to Palestinian statehood would be anywhere near as strong as they are now IF Israel was assured that any new Palestinian state *would be committed to** co-existing with Israel and held responsible for ALL attacks on Israel from its territory . Aside from some of the rather slanted proposals above , how *could* such `` guarantees '' be instilled ? For example , how could such `` guarantees '' / '' controls '' be added to the Palestinian PISGA proposals ? Israel is hanging on largely because it is scared stiff that the minute it lets go ( gives lands back to Arab states , no more `` buffer zone '' , gives full autonomy to Palestinians ) , ANY and/or ALL of the Arab parties could ( and *would* , if not `` controlled '' somehow ) EASILY return to the traditional anti-Israel position . The question then is HOW to *really* ensure that that will not happen . Tim

In fact , > it does n't mean *anything* , because the units are screwy . I agree and disagree . John is saying that the batters efforts will result in 4 more wins then losses . While you are probably correct that 400 % does not mean 4 more wins then losses , it means something . I would rather have a player who increased my teams chances of winning by 1 % in each of 400 PAs then I would a player who increased my chances of winning by .5 % in each of 400 PAs . Thus , there appears to me to be an obvious positive association between John 's statistic and winning games . Thus , before you disregard this stat , it appears to me that further study must go into what sort of relationship there is . > Consider an example : Bob hits a 2-out solo HR in the bottom of the first ; > about .12 on your scale .

So Fred and Bob combined have > amassed 138 % of a win IN ONE GAME . There 's clearly a problem here . The only problem here is an insistance that these number mean exactly how many wins the team has . First , we are using averages over many seasons and applying them to one game . Second , remember some players performance take away from the chance of you winning . That is a player who gets an out gets a `` negative probability '' in most cases . Thus , I 'm not sure in any given game when you add up all the numbers for a team who won that they will add up to 1 in that game . Sometimes , they will add up to more then one sometime , less than one . Also , the pitchers ' bad performances ( giving up 6 runs ) may have given them a large negative percentage for that game . Also , any batter that pulled an 0-4 night would give large negatives . > > Greg thinking about the right things , but his intuition is off the > > mark . Closers are enormously important .

If > late runs are really more important than early runs , then looking only at > late runs should lead to a *better* predictor , right ? No , but really only because you have a smaller sample size . I would think however , that the number of runs you score in the first inning would be just as good as a prediction as how many runs you score in the last inning . And , realize something else a closer usually comes in in a close situation , not a blow out . It is hard to argue that any runs that a closer gives up in a game have equal importance to those given up in the first inning . Look , a closer giving up runs often means a team will lose many games . On , the other hand a starter who gives up runs often still leaves his team a chance to win . The offence has many more outs to do something about . But , I am not saying all late inning situations are equally important either . If I am down 8 runs in the ninth , it really does not matter how many runs my pitcher gives up in the ninth . > Here 's another thought experiment : apply this method to basketball .

No , but why would you assume that the teams probability of winning would be 0 before the possesion in which the free throws were made . Look , if you are down 1 point with 5 seconds left , there is a fairly high probability that you will win the game if you are in possesion of the ball . And , do not forget that somebody elses missed shots , turnovers , fouls , bad defense , etc . caused a `` negative chance '' that the team would win . From reading all of the discussion on this statistic , I feel that those who critisize it to a certain extent are doing so out of an agenda . At first look this statistic valadates clutchness . But , it really does not . Cluthness revolves around the idea that certain players in crucial situation elevate their performance and others performance goes down . I 've never seen convincing proof that this really happens . So , if you assume there is no clutchness , then that means that except for a lot of noice , this statistic has a positive association to player performance . There is a way to get rid of the noice if you do not believe in clutchness . Certainly , we could find out what the average value of a home run is for example . We may find for instance , that a home run increases your chance of winning by 15 % on average while a strikeout decreases your chance of winning by 5 % . I bet if this were done we would find that this statistic was just as good as other statistics we have for predicting wins and losses . How do we evaluate relief pitchers ? Say John and Sam have the exact same pitching statistics ( runs , earned runs , K 's , BB 's , etc . ) Both had exceptional numbers . John , however only pitched in closer situations , while Sam was a Mop up man . Who was more valuble to their team ? Probably John . Who was the better pitcher ? They were probably about the same .

Is anyone out there in Christendom listening ? If so , why do n't we get some dialog going here ? Here 's a topic to get things started . My daughter 's Christian school sends home a weekly update on school related topics . This week they sent something *very* interesting . It was an article written by the leader of a national ( US ) Christian school organization about a trip he recently made to Jerusalem . While there , he was introduced to one of the rabbis who is working on a project to rebuild the Temple at Jerusalem . The article included photos of the many furnishings that have already been made in preparation for furnishing the rebuilt temple according to the specifications given in the Bible . What was even more striking is the fact that the plans for the temple are complete and the group is only awaiting permission from the Israeli government before beginning the building . The other startling fact is the very recent archeological discovery that the original site of the temple is unoccupied and available for building . Previously it has been thought that the original site was underneath what is now a mosque , making rebuilding impossible without sparking a holy war . Now it appears that nothing stands in the way of rebuilding and resuming sacrifices , as the Scriptures indicate will happen in the last days . Although the Israeli government will give the permission to start , I think it is the hand of God holding the project until He is ready to let it happen . Brothers and sisters , the time is at hand .

Typical posting : Why have a newsgroup about atheism ? Why do atheists organize in groups ? What is there to discuss ? Response : Many things are discussed here , including : * Whether it is reasonable to feign theism in order to avoid upsetting one's family * Prayer in schools * Discrimination against atheists * Sunday trading laws * The Satanic Child Abuse myth * Whether one should be an overt atheist or 'stay in the closet' * How religious societies prey ( sic ) on new college students * How to get rid of unwanted proselytizers * Whether religion is a danger to society and/or the individual * Why people become atheists Of course , inevitably alt.atheism tends to attract evangelical Christians looking for someone to convert . Most readers of the newsgroup do n't want to be preached to , although a few seem to derive perverse pleasure from tearing apart particularly ill-considered or uninformed postings . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Subject : Hitler was an atheist ! Typical posting : Hitler was an atheist , and look at what he did ! Response : Adolf Hitler was emphatically not an atheist . As he said himself : The folkish-minded man , in particular , has the sacred duty , each in his own denomination , of making _people_stop_just_talking_ superficially_of_God's_will , _and_actually_fulfill_God's_will , _and_ not_let_God's_word_be_desecrated._ [ orig . ital . ] For God 's will gave men their form , their essence , and their abilities . Anyone who destroys His work is declaring war on the Lord 's creation , the divine will . Therefore , let every man be active , each in his own denomination if you please , and let every man take it as his first and most sacred duty to oppose anyone who in his activity by word or deed steps outside the confines of his religious community and tries to butt into the other . [ ... ] Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will of the Almighty Creator : _by_defending_myself_against_the_Jew , _I_am_ fighting_for_the_work_of_the_Lord._ [ orig . ital . ] -- Adolf Hitler , from `` Mein Kampf '' , trans . Ralph Mannheim . Of course , someone bad believing something does not make that belief wrong . It 's also entirely possible that Hitler was lying when he claimed to believe in God . We certainly ca n't conclude that he 's an atheist , though . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Subject : The Bible proves it Typical posting : In the Bible it says that ... Response : Most of the readers of alt.atheism feel that the Bible is of questionable accuracy , as it was written thousands of years ago by many authors who were recording oral tradition that existed many years before . Thus , any claimed 'truth ' in it is of questionable legitimacy . This is n't to say that The Bible has no truth in it ; simply that any truth must be examined before being accepted . Many of the readers of this group also feel that because any passage is subject to `` interpretation '' , any claim that a passage 'means ' one thing and one thing only is not legitimate . Note that this feeling tends to extend to other books . It is also remarkable to many atheists that theists tend to ignore other equally plausible religious books in favour of those of their own religion . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Subject : Pascal 's Wager Typical posting : If you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect , you have lost nothing -- but if you do n't believe in God and turn out to be incorrect , you will go to hell . Therefore it is foolish to be an atheist . Response : This argument is known as Pascal 's Wager . It has several flaws . Firstly , it does not indicate which religion to follow . Indeed , there are many mutually exclusive and contradictory religions out there . This is often described as the `` avoiding the wrong hell '' problem . If a person is a follower of religion X , he may end up in religion Y 's version of hell . Secondly , the statement that `` If you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect , you have lost nothing '' is not true . Suppose you 're believing in the wrong God -- the true God might punish you for your foolishness . Consider also the deaths that have resulted from people rejecting medicine in favour of prayer . Another flaw in the argument is that it is based on the assumption that the two possibilities are equally likely -- or at least , that they are of comparable likelihood . If , in fact , the possibility of there being a God is close to zero , the argument becomes much less persuasive . So sadly the argument is only likely to convince those who believe already . Also , many feel that for intellectually honest people , belief is based on evidence , with some amount of intuition . It is not a matter of will or cost-benefit analysis . Formally speaking , the argument consists of four statements : 1 . One does not know whether God exists . 2 . Not believing in God is bad for one 's eternal soul if God does exist . 3 . Believing in God is of no consequence if God does not exist . 4 . Therefore it is in one 's interest to believe in God . There are two approaches to the argument . The first is to view 1 as an assumption , and 2 as a consequence of it . One problem with this approach , in the abstract , is that it creates information from no information . This is considered invalid in information theory . Statement 1 indicates one has no information about God -- but statement 2 indicates that beneficial information can be gained from the absolute lack of information about God . This violates information entropy -- information has been extracted from no information , at no `` cost '' . The alternative approach is to claim that 1 and 2 are both assumptions . The problem with this is that 2 is then basically an assumption which states the Christian position , and only a Christian will agree with that assumption . The argument thus collapses to `` If you are a Christian , it is in your interests to believe in God '' -- a rather vacuous tautology , and not the way Pascal intended the argument to be viewed . The biggest reason why Pascal 's wager is a failure is that if God is omniscient he will certainly know who really believes and who believes as a wager . He will spurn the latter ... assuming he actually cares at all whether people believe in him . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Subject : What is Occam 's Razor ? Typical posting : People keep talking about Occam 's Razor . What is it ? Response : William of Occam formulated a principle which has become known as Occam 's Razor . In its original form , it said `` Do not multiply entities unnecessarily . '' That is , if you can explain something without supposing the existence of some entity , then do so . Nowadays when people refer to Occam 's Razor , they generally express it more generally , for example as `` Take the simplest solution '' . The relevance to atheism is that we can look at two possible explanations for what we see around us : 1 . There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there , which came into being as a result of natural processes . 2 . There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there , and there is also a God who created the universe . Clearly this God must be of non-zero complexity . Given that both explanations fit the facts , Occam 's Razor might suggest that we should take the simpler of the two -- solution number one . Unfortunately , some argue that there is a third even more simple solution : 3 . There is n't an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there . We just imagine that there is . This third option leads us logically towards solipsism , which many people find unacceptable . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Subject : Why it 's good to believe in Jesus Typical posting : I want to tell people about the virtues and benefits of my religion . Response : Preaching is not appreciated . Feel free to talk about your religion , but please do not write postings that are on a `` conversion '' theme . Such postings do not belong on alt.atheism and will be rejected from alt.atheism.moderated ( try the newsgroup talk.religion.misc ) . You would doubtless not welcome postings from atheists to your favourite newsgroup in an attempt to convert you ; please do unto others as you would have them do unto you ! Often theists make their basic claims about God in the form of lengthy analogies or parables . Be aware that atheists have heard of God and know the basic claims about him ; if the sole purpose of your parable is to tell atheists that God exists and brings salvation , you may as well not post it , since it tells us nothing we have not been told before . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Subject : Why I know that God exists Typical posting : I *know* from personal experience and prayer that God exists . Response : Just as many theists have personal evidence that the being they worship exists , so many atheists have personal evidence that such beings do not exist . That evidence varies from person to person . Furthermore , without wishing to dismiss your evidence out of hand , many people have claimed all kinds of unlikely things -- that they have been abducted by UFOs , visited by the ghost of Elvis , and so on . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Subject : Einstein and `` God does not play dice '' Typical posting : Albert Einstein believed in God . Do you think you 're cleverer than him ? Response : Einstein did once comment that `` God does not play dice [ with the universe ] '' . This quotation is commonly mentioned to show that Einstein believed in the Christian God . Used this way , it is out of context ; it refers to Einstein's refusal to accept the uncertainties indicated by quantum theory . Furthermore , Einstein 's religious background was Jewish rather than Christian . A better quotation showing what Einstein thought about God is the following : '' I believe in Spinoza 's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists , not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings . '' Einstein was unable to accept Quantum Theory because of his belief in an objective , orderly reality ; a reality which would not be subject to random events and which would not be dependent upon the observer . He believed that QM was incomplete , and that a better theory would have no need for statistical interpretations . So far no such better theory has been found , and much evidence suggests that it never will be . A longer quote from Einstein appears in `` Science , Philosophy , and Religion , A Symposium '' , published by the Conference on Science , Philosophy and Religion in Their Relation to the Democratic Way of Life , Inc. , New York , 1941 . In it he says : `` The more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature . For him neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exists as an independent cause of natural events . To be sure , the doctrine of a personal God interfering with natural events could never be *refuted* [ italics his ] , in the real sense , by science , for this doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific knowledge has not yet been able to set foot . But I am convinced that such behavior on the part of representatives of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal . For a doctrine which is to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark , will of necessity lose its effect on mankind , with incalculable harm to human progress . In their struggle for the ethical good , teachers of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal God , that is , give up that source of fear and hope which in the past placed such vast power in the hands of priests . In their labors they will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable of cultivating the Good , the True , and the Beautiful in humanity itself . This is , to be sure , a more difficult but an incomparably more worthy task ... '' Einstein has also said : `` It was , of course , a lie what you read about my religous convictions , a lie which is being systematically repeated . I do not believe in a personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly . If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it . '' The latter quote is from `` Albert Einstein : The Human Side '' , edited by Helen Dukas and Banesh Hoffman , and published by Princeton University Press . Also from the same book : `` I do not believe in immortality of the individual , and I consider ethics to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind it . '' Of course , the fact that Einstein chose not to believe in Christianity does not in itself imply that Christianity is false . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Subject : Everyone worships something Typical posting : Everyone worships something , whether it 's money , power or God . Response : If that is true , everyone is a polytheist . Theists care just as much about those things that atheists care about .

Response : The set of real numbers greater than zero has a definite lower bound , but has no smallest member . Further , even if it is true that there must be a causeless cause , that does not imply that that cause must be a conscious supernatural entity , and especially not that any such entity must match the description favoured by any particular religion . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Subject : The universe is so complex it must have been designed Typical posting : The presence of design in the universe proves there is a God . Surely you do n't think all this appeared here just by chance ? Response : This is known as the Argument From Design . It is a matter of dispute whether there is any element of design in the universe . Those who believe that the complexity and diversity of living creatures on the earth is evidence of a creator are best advised to read the newsgroup talk.origins for a while . There is insufficient space to summarize both sides of that debate here . However , the conclusion is that there is no scientific evidence in favour of so-called Scientific Creationism . Furthermore , there is much evidence , observation and theory that can explain many of the complexities of the universe and life on earth . The origin of the Argument by Design is a feeling that the existence of something as incredibly intricate as , say , a human is so improbable that surely it ca n't have come about by chance ; that surely there must be some external intelligence directing things so that humans come from the chaos deliberately . But if human intelligence is so improbable , surely the existence of a mind capable of fashioning an entire universe complete with conscious beings must be immeasurably more unlikely ? The approach used to argue in favour of the existence of a creator can be turned around and applied to the Creationist position . This leads us to the familiar theme of `` If a creator created the universe , what created the creator ? `` , but with the addition of spiralling improbability . The only way out is to declare that the creator was not created and just `` is '' ( or `` was '' ) . From here we might as well ask what is wrong with saying that the universe just `` is '' without introducing a creator ? Indeed Stephen Hawking , in his book '' A Brief History of Time '' , explains his theory that the universe is closed and finite in extent , with no beginning or end . The Argument From Design is often stated by analogy , in the so-called Watchmaker Argument . One is asked to imagine that one has found a watch on the beach . Does one assume that it was created by a watchmaker , or that it evolved naturally ? Of course one assumes a watchmaker . Yet like the watch , the universe is intricate and complex ; so , the argument goes , the universe too must have a creator . The Watchmaker analogy suffers from three particular flaws , over and above those common to all Arguments By Design . Firstly , a watchmaker creates watches from pre-existing materials , whereas God is claimed to have created the universe from nothing . These two sorts of creation are clearly fundamentally different , and the analogy is therefore rather weak . Secondly , a watchmaker makes watches , but there are many other things in the world . If we walked further along the beach and found a nuclear reactor , we would n't assume it was created by the watchmaker . The argument would therefore suggest a multitude of creators , each responsible for a different part of creation . Finally , in the first part of the watchmaker argument we conclude that the watch is not part of nature because it is ordered , and therefore stands out from the randomness of nature . Yet in the second part of the argument , we start from the position that the universe is obviously not random , but shows elements of order . The Watchmaker argument is thus internally inconsistent . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Subject : Independent evidence that the Bible is true Typical posting : The events of the New Testament are confirmed by independent documentary evidence . For example ... Response : The writings of Josephus are often mentioned as independent documentary evidence . Early versions of Josephus 's work are thought not to have mentioned Jesus or James ; the extant version discusses John in a non-Christian context . Many scholars believe that the original mentioned Jesus and James in passing , but that this was expanded by Christian copyists . Several `` reconstructions '' of the original text have been published to this effect . Much information appears in the Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius ( about 320 C.E. ) . It is worthless as historical material because of the deliberate falsification of the wily Eusebius who is generally acknowledged as 'the first thoroughly dishonest historian of antiquity . ' It is Eusebius who is generally given the title of authorship for this material . Aside from the New Testament , the biographical information about Jesus is more well-documented . For further information , please consult the Frequently Asked Questions file for the newsgroup soc.religion.christian . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Subject : Godel 's Incompleteness Theorem Typical posting : Godel 's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible for the Bible to be both true and complete . Response : Godel 's First Incompleteness Theorem says that in any consistent formal system which is sufficiently expressive that it can model ordinary arithmetic , one can formulate expressions which can never be proven to be valid or invalid ( 'true ' or 'false ' ) within that formal system . ( Technically speaking , the system must also be recursive ; that is , there must be a decision procedure for determining whether a given string is an axiom within the formal system . ) Essentially , all such systems can formulate what is known as a `` Liar Paradox . '' The classic Liar Paradox sentence in ordinary English is `` This sentence is false . '' Note that if a proposition is undecidable , the formal system can not even deduce that it is undecidable . The logic used in theological discussions is rarely well defined , so claims that Godel 's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible to prove or disprove ) the existence of God are worthless in isolation . One can trivially define a formal system in which it is possible to prove the existence of God , simply by having the existence of God stated as an axiom . This is unlikely to be viewed by atheists as a convincing proof , however . It may be possible to succeed in producing a formal system built on axioms that both atheists and theists agree with . It may then be possible to show that Godel 's Incompleteness Theorem holds for that system . However , that would still not demonstrate that it is impossible to prove that God exists within the system . Furthermore , it certainly would n't tell us anything about whether it is possible to prove the existence of God generally . Note also that all of these hypothetical formal systems tell us nothing about the actual existence of God ; the formal systems are just abstractions . Another frequent claim is that Godel 's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that a religious text ( the Bible , the Book of Mormon or whatever ) can not be both consistent and universally applicable . Religious texts are not formal systems , so such claims are nonsense . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Subject : George Bush on atheism and patriotism Typical posting : Did George Bush really say that atheists should not be considered citizens ? Response : The following exchange took place at the Chicago airport between Robert I. Sherman of American Atheist Press and George Bush , on August 27 1988 . Sherman is a fully accredited reporter , and was present by invitation as a member of the press corps . The Republican presidential nominee was there to announce federal disaster relief for Illinois . The discussion turned to the presidential primary : RS : `` What will you do to win the votes of Americans who are atheists ? '' GB : `` I guess I 'm pretty weak in the atheist community . Faith in God is important to me . '' RS : `` Surely you recognize the equal citizenship and patriotism of Americans who are atheists ? '' GB : `` No , I do n't know that atheists should be considered as citizens , nor should they be considered patriots . This is one nation under God . '' RS : `` Do you support as a sound constitutional principle the separation of state and church ? '' GB : `` Yes , I support the separation of church and state . I 'm just not very high on atheists . '' UPI reported on May 8 , 1989 , that various atheist organizations were still angry over the remarks . The exchange appeared in the Boulder Daily Camera on Monday February 27 , 1989 . It can also be found in `` Free Enquiry '' magazine , Fall 1988 issue , Volume 8 , Number 4 , page 16 . On October 29 , 1988 , Mr. Sherman had a confrontation with Ed Murnane , cochairman of the Bush-Quayle '88 Illinois campaign . This concerned a lawsuit Mr. Sherman had filed to stop the Community Consolidated School District 21 ( Chicago , Illinois ) from forcing his first-grade Atheist son to pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States as `` one nation under God '' ( Bush 's phrase ) . The following conversation took place : RS : `` American Atheists filed the Pledge of Allegiance lawsuit yesterday . Does the Bush campaign have an official response to this filing ? '' EM : `` It 's bullshit . '' RS : `` What is bullshit ? '' EM : `` Everything that American Atheists does , Rob , is bullshit . '' RS : `` Thank you for telling me what the official position of the Bush campaign is on this issue . '' EM : `` You 're welcome . '' After Bush 's election , American Atheists wrote to Bush asking him to retract his statement . On February 21st 1989 , C. Boyden Gray , Counsel to the President , replied on White House stationery that Bush substantively stood by his original statement , and wrote : `` As you are aware , the President is a religious man who neither supports atheism nor believes that atheism should be unnecessarily encouraged or supported by the government .

Here are some quotes ; there are many more . `` What influence , in fact , have ecclesiastical establishments had on society ? In some instances they have been seen to erect a spiritual tyranny on the ruins of the civil authority ; on many instances they have been seen upholding the thrones of political tyranny ; in no instance have they been the guardians of the liberties of the people . Rulers who wish to subvert the public liberty may have found an established clergy convenient auxiliaries . A just government , instituted to secure and perpetuate it , needs them not . '' - James Madison , `` A Memorial and Remonstrance '' , 1785 `` I almost shudder at the thought of alluding to the most fatal example of the abuses of grief which the history of mankind has preserved -- the Cross . Consider what calamities that engine of grief has produced ! '' - John Adams , in a letter to Thomas Jefferson `` History I believe furnishes no example of a priest-ridden people maintaining a free civil government . This marks the lowest grade of ignorance , of which their political as well as religious leaders will always avail themselves for their own purpose . '' - Thomas Jefferson to Baron von Humboldt , 1813 `` I can not conceive otherwise than that He , the Infinite Father , expects or requires no worship or praise from us , but that He is even infinitely above it .

Response : No . The quotation often given is in fact from Article XI of the 1797 Treaty of Tripoli ( 8 Stat 154 , Treaty Series 358 ) : Article 11 As the government of the United States of America is not in any sense founded on the Christian Religion , -- as it has in itself no character of enmity against the laws , religion or tranquility of Musselmen , -- and as the said States never have entered into any war or act of hostility against any Mehomitan nation , it is declared by the parties that no pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption of the harmony existing between the two countries . The text may be found in the Congressional Record or in treaty collections such as Charles Bevans ' `` Treaties and Other International Agreements of the United States of America 1776-1949 '' , vol . 11 ( pp . 1070-1080 ) . The English text of the Treaty of Tripoli was approved by the U.S. Senate on June 7 , 1797 and ratified by President John Adams on June 10 , 1797 . It was recently discovered that the Arabic version of the treaty not only lacks the quotation , it lacks Article XI altogether . The person who translated the Arabic to English was Joel Barlow , Consul General at Algiers , a close friend of Thomas Paine -- and an opponent of Christianity . It is possible that Barlow made up Article XI , but since there is no Arabic version of that article to be found , it 's hard to say . In 1806 a new Treaty of Tripoli was ratified which no longer contained the quotation . End of FAQ Digest ***************** ÿ

This disease is universally and usually rapidly fatal . After diagnosis in June 1992 , the tumor was growing rapidly despite radiation and chemotherapy . The forum member checked extensively on Dr. Burzynki 's track record for this disease . He spoke to a few patients in complete remission for a few years from glioblastoma following this treatment and to an NCI oncologist who had audited other such case histories and found them valid and impressive . After the forum member 's father began Dr. Burzynski 's treatment in September , all subsequent scans performed under the auspices of his oncologist in Chicago have shown no tumor growth with possible signs of shrinkage or necrosis . The patient 's oncologist , although telling him he would probably not live past December 1992 , was vehemently opposed to his trying Dr. Burzynski 's treatment . Since the tumor stopped its rapid growth under Dr. Burzynski 's treatment , she 's since changed her attitude toward continuing these treatments , saying `` if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it . '' Dr. Burzynski is an M.D. , Ph.D. with a research background who found a protein that is at very low serum levels in cancer patients , synthesized it , and administers it to patients with certain cancer types . There is little understanding of the actual mechanism of activity . /*********************************************************************/ /* -- - David E.

If the Papacy is infallible , and this is a matter of faith , then the Pope can not `` be wrong ! '' If , on the other hand , this is not a matter of faith , but a matter of Church law , then we should still obey as the Pope is the legal head of the church .

The doctrine on infallibility does not say that the pope is always right . All Catholic theologians acknowledge that there have been a number of occasions when the pope was wrong . There appear to be two aspects to infallibility . One is a general concept that in the long run the Church is protected from serious error . However this does not mean that it 's impossible for it to take wrong turns at one time or another . The more specific concept of papal infallibility is that in very specific circumstances a papal statement can be known to be infallible . However a relatively small fraction of statements meet those criteria . This does not absolve Catholics from the duty to obey even `` ordinary '' teachings of the pope . However only a few teachings are made in a way that is explicitly infallible . -- clh ]
From : Wales.Larrison @ ofa123.fidonet.org Subject : Space Advertising ( 1 of 2 ) X-Sender : newtout 0.08 Feb 23 1993 Lines : 81 Brian Yamauchi asks : [ Regarding orbital billboards ... ] > And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN > news blip ? How serious is this project ? Is this just in the `` wild > idea '' stage or does it have real funding ? Well , I had been collecting data for next edition of the Commercial Space News/Space Technology Investor ... To summarize : SPACE ADVERTISING First , advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is very common practice to put the cooperating organization 's logos on the space launch vehicle . For example , the latest GPS launcher had the ( very prominent ) logos on its side of - McDonnell Douglas ( the Delta launcher ) - Rockwell International ( who built the GPS satellite ) - USAF ( who paid for the satellite and launch ) , and - the GPS/Navstar program office This has not been considered `` paid advertising '' but rather '' public relations '' , since the restrictions have been such that only organizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the side , and there was no money exchanged for this . [ However , putting a 10 ' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras is `` advertising '' as much as it is `` public relations '' , in my opinion . ] [ And by the way , I note that the DC-X test vehicle has rather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side ... ] There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials for use of space vehicles for advertising , or placing large advertising signs in orbit . On the shuttle , for example , I know of several serious studies in the early and mid 1980 's which looked at putting logos on the external tank , or on the sides of the payload bay . These ventures would be different than `` public relations '' , in that the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms participating on that flight , and would involve payment of sums for the right to fly the logos in a prominent organization . ( For example , painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can , or putting a Disneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras would scan past it . ) ADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about 1990 , when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed to pay to put their logos on a Proton launch . ( An Italian shoe company was one of the first advertisers , I remember . ) Similarly , Soviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last Olympic games , and have gleefully shown banners and other items from participating firms and organizations . Mars candy bars , for example , got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the British visiting cosmonaut to Mir . Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch vehicles . The upcoming Conestoga launch ( in June ) putting the COMET recoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements on the side , for Arnold Schwarzenegger 's upcoming movie `` The Last Action Hero '' . Besides the usual logos of the participating organizations , Columbia pictures has paid $ 500,000 to put ads on the main fuselage of the mission 's Conestoga rocket , its booster rockets , and on the COMET payload , which will orbit the Earth for one month . A concept for this advertising display was published in Space News magazine a couple of months ago . ( As a side note : Robert Lorsch , an advertising executive , is talking about suing NASA . He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he created with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising sponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the space program . Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on the upcoming COMET , NASA violated an agreement that it `` would not use his idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and receiving compensation . '' This is being disputed , since the launch is a `` commercial launch '' and NASA is receiving none of the advertising revenues , but the funding for the COMET program is coming from NASA . ) ORBITAL `` BILLBOARDS '' Orbital `` billboards '' have been the staple of science fiction for some time . Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example , and Robert Heinlein described another in `` The Man Who Sold the Moon '' . Several different potential projects have been developed , although none have been implemented , but the most real prior to 1993 being the `` Eiffel II '' project , which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in orbit to celebrate the French Republic 's Bi-centennial .

From : lumpkin @ corvus.nas.nasa.gov ( Forrest E. Lumpkin III ) Subject : HELP - SCSI Woes on Mac IIfx Keywords : SCSI , IIfx Organization : NASA Ames Research Center Lines : 46 I am having trouble with SCSI on a Mac IIfx . The machine is 3 years old and I have been using the same hard drive ( internal Maxtor LXT-200S ) for two and a half years . The disk recently crashed . I reformatted ( Silverlining 5.42 ) , but during the reformat I received random write errors during testing . The error message reported was like : Sector 0 : Write error detected after testing good - sector not mapped out . This occurred randomly all over the hard disk ( which makes me suspect the diagnostic 's reference to Sector 0 ? ? ? ) . On the third reformat and after reinstalling the SCSI read/write loops I was able to get through passes 2,3 , and 4 with no errors . ( Pass 1 for some reason reported a lot of errors , but still mapped out no sectors . ) I decided to go ahead and try to resinstall System 7 and reload my data from a backup . This proceded normally ; however , I now have sub-optimal performance . Symptoms include : o Frequent crashes o Instances of extremely sluggish disk access requiring a reboot to correct . o Instances of not finding the disk on the SCSI chain on reboot . - If I boot from Norton Utl . after this occurs , it can not find the disk either . - The only thing that fixes this is recycling the power . It sometimes requires several attempts . QUESTIONS : 1 ) Has anyone had this type of problem before ? 2 ) Is the problem with the fx motherboard ( And its non-standard SCSI implementation ) or with my Maxtor Disk ? Is there some diagnostic software that would help me make this determination ? 3 ) Is it a termination problem ? I currently have external Syquest and an external DataFrame XP60 on the chain . The XP60 is at the end , and has internal termination ; so I am not using the IIfx terminator . I do have the SCSI filter installed on the internal drive . I have run with this exact steup for 2 1/2 years with one previous disk crash requiring a reformat ( about a year ago ) . I also have symptoms if I disconnect the external devices ; so I do n't see how SCSI termination would now be an issue . Of course who knows : - < Help would be much appreciated . Forrest E.

It ( this FAQ , not RIPEM ) was written and will be maintained by Marc VanHeyningen , < mvanheyn @ whale.cs.indiana.edu > . It will be posted to a variety of newsgroups on a monthly basis ; follow-up discussion specific to RIPEM is redirected to the group alt.security.ripem . This month , I have reformatted this posting in an attempt to comply with the standards for HyperText FAQ formatting to allow easy manipulation of this document over the World Wide Web . Let me know what you think . DISCLAIMER -- -- -- -- -- Nothing in this FAQ should be considered legal advice , or anything other than one person 's opinion . If you want real legal advice , talk to a real lawyer . QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 1 ) What is RIPEM ? RIPEM is a program which performs Privacy Enhanced Mail ( PEM ) using the cryptographic techniques of RSA and DES . It allows your electronic mail to have the properties of authentication ( i.e . who sent it can be confirmed ) and privacy ( i.e . nobody can read it except the intended recipient . ) RIPEM was written primarily by Mark Riordan < mrr @ scss3.cl.msu.edu > . Most of the code is in the public domain , except for the RSA routines , which are a library called RSAREF licensed from RSA Data Security Inc. 2 ) How can I get RIPEM ? RIPEM contains the library of cryptographic routines RSAREF , which is considered munitions and thus is export-restricted from distribution to people who are not citizens or permanent residents of the U.S. or Canada . Therefore , the following request is quoted from the README file : # Please do not export the cryptographic code in this distribution # outside of the USA or Canada . This is a personal request from me , # the author of RIPEM , and a condition of your use of RIPEM . Note that RSAREF is not in the public domain , and a license for it is included with the distribution . You should read it before using RIPEM . The best way to get it is to ask a friend for a copy , since this will reduce the load on those sites that do carry it ( not to mention the humans that run them . ) Naturally this requires that you trust the friend . RIPEM is available via anonymous FTP to citizens and permanent residents in the U.S. from rsa.com ; cd to rsaref/ and read the README file for info . Last I looked , this site contains only the source tree , and does not contain compiled binaries or the nice Mac version . RIPEM , as well as some other crypt stuff , has its `` home site '' on rpub.cl.msu.edu , which is open to non-anonymous FTP for users in the U.S. and Canada who are citizens or permanent residents . To find out how to obtain access , ftp there , cd to pub/crypt/ , and read the file GETTING_ACCESS . For convenience , binaries for many architectures are available here in addition to the full source tree . 3 ) Will RIPEM run on my machine ? Probably . It has already been ported to MS-DOS and most flavors of Unix ( SunOS , NeXT , Linux , AIX , ULTRIX , Solaris , etc . ) Ports to Macintosh include a standard UNIX-style port and a rather nice Mac-like port written by Raymond Lau , author of StuffIt . More ports are expected , and help of users is invited . 4 ) Will RIPEM work with my mailer ? Probably . How easy and clean the effective interface is will depend on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer , though . The users guide , included with the distribution , discusses ways to use RIPEM with many popular mailers , including Berkeley , mush , Elm , and MH . Code is also included in elisp to allow easy use of RIPEM inside GNU Emacs . If you make a new interface for RIPEM or create an improvement on one in the distribution which you believe is convenient to use , secure , and may be useful to others , feel free to post it to alt.security.ripem . 5 ) What is RSA ? RSA is a crypto system which is asymmetric , or public-key . This means that there are two different , related keys : one to encrypt and one to decrypt . Because one can not ( reasonably ) be derived from the other , you may publish your encryption , or public key widely and keep your decryption , or private key to yourself . Anyone can use your public key to encrypt a message , but only you hold the private key needed to decrypt it . ( Note that the `` message '' sent with RSA is normally just the DES key to the real message . ( See `` What is DES ? '' ) Note that the above only provides for privacy . For authentication , the fingerprint of the message ( See `` What is a fingerprint , like MD5 ? '' ) is encrypted with the sender 's private key . The recipient can use the sender 's public key to decrypt it and confirm that the message must have come from the sender . RSA was named for the three men ( Rivest , Shamir and Adleman ) who invented it . To find out more about RSA , ftp to rsa.com and look in pub/faq/ or look in sci.crypt . 6 ) What is DES ? DES is the Data Encryption Standard , a widely used symmetric , or secret-key , crypto system . Unlike RSA , DES uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt messages . However , DES is much faster than RSA . RIPEM uses both DES and RSA ; it generates a random key and encrypts your mail with DES using that key . It then encrypts that key with the recipient 's public RSA key and includes the result in the letter , allowing the recipient to recover the DES key . DES is sometimes considered weak because it is somewhat old and uses a key length considered too short by modern standards . However , it should be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large corporation or government agency . It is not unlikely that future RIPEMs will strengthen the symmetric cipher , possibly by using multiple encryption with DES . 7 ) What is PEM , and how does RIPEM relate ? PEM is Privacy Enhanced Mail , a system for allowing easy transfer of encrypted electronic mail . It is described in RFCs 1421-1424 ; these documents have been approved and obsolete the old RFCs 1113-1115 . RIPEM is not really a complete implementation of PEM , because PEM specifies certificates for authenticating keys , which RIPEM does not handle at this time . Their addition is planned . 8 ) What 's this about distributing and authenticating keys ? For a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you , she must know your public key . For you to be able to confirm that the message received came from her , you must know her public key . It is important that this information be accurate ; if a `` bad guy '' convinces her that his key is in fact yours , she will send messages which he can read . RIPEM allows for three methods of key management : a central server , the distributed finger servers , and a flat file . All three are described in the RIPEM users guide which is part of the distribution . None of them provide perfect security . 9 ) Why do all RIPEM public keys look very similar ? RIPEM public keys begin with a PKCS identifier describing various characteristics about the key , so the first bunch of characters in your key may be the same as those of lots of other people 's keys . This does not mean your keys are similar , but only that they are the same class of key , were generated with the same program , are of the same length , etc . 10 ) What is a fingerprint , like MD5 ? MD5 is a message digest algorithm produced by RSA Data Security Inc . It provides a 128-bit fingerprint , or cryptographically secure hash , of the plaintext . It is cryptographically secure because it is not possible ( in a reasonable amount of computation ) to produce a different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint . Thus , instead of signing the entire message with the sender 's private key , only the MD5 of the message needs to be signed for authentication . MD5 is sometimes used for other purposes ; for example , it is often used to map an input of arbitrary length to 128 bits of data , as a passphrase interpreter or cookie generator . MD5 is described in its entirety ( including an implementation in C ) in RFC 1321 . 11 ) What is PGP ? PGP is another cryptographic mail program called Pretty Good Privacy . PGP has been around longer than RIPEM , and works somewhat differently . PGP is not compatible with RIPEM in any way , though PGP does also use RSA . Some major differences between PGP and RIPEM : - PGP has more key management features , particularly for users without a direct network connection . - RIPEM conforms to the PEM RFCs and thus has a greater probability of working with other PEM software . PGP makes no attempt to be compatible with anything other than PGP ( in fact , PGP 1.0 is not compatible with PGP 2.0 . ) - RIPEM uses RSAREF , a library of RSA routines from RSA Data Security Inc. RSAREF comes with a license which allows noncommercial use . PGP uses its own implementation of RSA which is not licensed ; thus , PKP , the firm holding the U.S. patents on the RSA algorithm , claims that it is a infringement of that patent to make , use or sell PGP in the U.S. or Canada . In acknowledgement of this , PGP 's original author , Phil Zimmermann , says in the documentation : # In fact , if you live in the USA , and you are not a Federal agency , # you should n't actually run PGP on your computer , because Public # Key Partners wants to forbid you from running my software . PGP is # contraband . - Both PGP and RIPEM are export-restricted , and can not be sent outside the U.S. and Canada . However , PGP already exists on many ftp sites in Europe and other places . Whether you use PGP or RIPEM or whatever , the documentation to PGP is recommended reading to anyone interested in such issues . Note that the above facts , both regarding patent and export restrictions , are somewhat controversial ; many people think it should n't be that way , and some people interpret various documents differently . Unfortunately , discussions of it on the net inevitably seem to produce more heat than light , and probably belong in misc.legal.computing . ( See : `` DISCLAIMER '' ) 12 ) What about RPEM ? RPEM stands for Rabin Privacy Enhanced Mail . It was similar to RIPEM , but used a public-key cipher invented by Rabin ( which is not RSA ) in an attempt to avoid the patent on RSA . It was written by Mark Riordan , the same author as RIPEM . Its distribution was halted when , contrary to the beliefs of many ( including Rabin ) , Public Key Partners ( PKP ) claimed that their patent was broad enough to cover any public-key cipher whose strength rested in the difficulty of factoring products of large primes , not just RSA . This claim is not universally accepted by any means , but was not challenged for pragmatic reasons . RPEM is not really used anymore . It is not compatible with RIPEM or PGP . 13 ) What is MIME ? MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions , and is described in RFC 1341 . You can find out about it in the newsgroup comp.mail.mime . How PEM should interact with MIME is not yet entirely clear ; some people use the stopgap solution of having a MIME type application/x-ripem in order to send RIPEM messages as MIME ones . I hope some standards will emerge . Draft Internet documents exist on the matter . 14 ) I have this simple way to defeat the security of RIPEM ... You may wish to check the companion post `` ripem-attacks '' which discusses some of the more obvious attacks on RIPEM 's security and what procedures will minimize the risk . RIPEM 's main `` weak area '' is probably key distribution .

But when I use the F1 key while in vi or in a program I wrote to spit back the hex values of keyboard input , I only get < 7f > < 3e > .

The solar panel offpoint was returned to zero degrees and spacecraft temperatures dropped 2-3 degrees C. 2 . An end-to-end test of the Delayed Aerobraking Data readout process was conducted this week in preparation for the Transition Experiment . There was some difficulty locking up to the data frames , and engineers are presently checking whether the problem was in equipment at the tracking station . 3 . Magellan has completed 7277 orbits of Venus and is now 32 days from the end of Cycle 4 and the start of the Transition Experiment . 4 . Magellan scientists were participating in the Brown-Vernadsky Microsymposium at Brown University in Providence , RI , this week . This joint meeting of U.S. and Russian Venus researchers has been continuing for many years . 5 . A three-day simulation of Transition Experiment aerobraking activities is planned for next week , including Orbit Trim Maneuvers and Starcal ( Star calibration ) Orbits . ___ _____ ___ /_ /| /____/ \ /_ /| Ron Baalke | baalke @ kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov | | | | __ \ /| | | | Jet Propulsion Lab | ___| | | | |__ ) |/ | | |__ M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand /___| | | | ___/ | |/__ /| Pasadena , CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and |_____|/ |_|/ |_____|/ | part vegetable .

If IDE speed come from IDA WHERE does the 8.3MB/s sighted for IDE come from ? SCSI is not complex . It is just the way the industry uses and talks about it . There are THREE key differences in SCSI ; the controller chip , the port , and the software . THAT IS IT . Let us look as SCSi in from THIS stand point . SCSI-1 : asynchronous and synchronous modes { SOFTWARE SCSI DRIVER ONLY } asynchronous is slower then synchronous mode { only 0-3MB/s vs. 0-5MB/s } synchronous speeds can be reached by most SCSi-1 divices with a rewrite of the software driver { As is the case for the Mac Quadra . } SCSI-2 { 8-bit } : THIS is the main source for the confusion . This differs from SCSI-1 ONLY in the controler chip in most machines . In the Mac and some PCs this is called 'fast SCSI-1 ' because it uses SCSI-1 ports and software drivers AND can produce SCSI-2 SPEEDS through SCSI-1 INSPITE of this even in the slower asynchronous mode . Average speed in asynchronous SCSi-1 mode 4-6MB/s with 8MB/s { See in both Quadras and higher end PCs } Synchronous mode just allows a higher burst rate { 10/MB/s } SCSI-2 { 16-bit } : TWO versions-Wide/Fast . Wide SCSI-2 requires TWO things over 8-bit SCSI-2 : a SCSI-2 software driver and a wide SCSI port on the machine and the external device . Fast SCSI-2 also requires TWO things over 8-bit SCSI-2 : SCSI-2 driver software and that the RECIEVING devise support 16-bit fast SCSI-2 . Speed of both is the same : 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst . SCSI-2 { 32-bit } : Also know as Wide AND Fast SCSI . Over 8-bit SCSI-2 this requires : SCSI-2 driver software , wide SCSI-2 port , and that the RECIEVING devices ALSO have a 32-bit mode SCSI-2 chip . As expected this is VERY expencive . Speed : 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s bursts As I said SIMPLE . Seven versions of SCSI seperated by software , the controler chip , and the port . Standarize the SOFTWARE and it DROPS to only FIVE versions of SCSI seperate by only HARDWARE { the chip and the port }

From : hedrick @ cs.rutgers.edu Subject : Re : Doing the work of God ? ? ! ! ) Lines : 59 Desiree Bradley ( Desiree_Bradley @ mindlink.bc.ca ) asked us whether we should think of the Serbs as doing God 's work in Bosnia . I've refrained from posting , in hope that someone who is more familiar with the OT than I would answer . But at this point I feel I have to say something . Many things about this posting bother me . I know of not the slightest suggestion in the NT that Christians should use force to propagate the Gospel , and the idea that we should not be concerned about the death of Moslems violates the heart of the Gospel . Christ died to break down these distinctions . In him there is neither Jew nor Greek , there is neither slave nor free , there is neither male nor female . If Moslems do not know him , we may preach to them , but we do n't kill them . Furthermore , the attack is between states , not religions . There are Christians being attacked as well . One of the towns under attack is one of the few places where Christians and Moslems are living together peacefully . The precedents being suggested are from the OT . There are in fact two different things being alluded to . The first is from the entry into Canaan . For that to be a parallel , we would need for God to have promised this land through a prophet . And we would need the war to be a holy war . There were tight constraints on behavior in those attacks . Any violations were likely to cause the Israelites to be defeated . Rape would not have been tolerated . While the accounts in Joshua emphasize towns that were totally destroyed , note that it was possible for a town to make peace with the Israelites , and that once that was done -- even when deception was involved -- they were expected to honor it . In contrast , there have been many violations of agreement in this incident . I see no evidence that God has granted Bosnia to the Serbs as a promised land , and if he had , their behavior would have disqualified this from being a holy war . The other OT parallel is from later , when Israel was defeated by Assyria and Babylonia . The prophets saw this as a judgement on Israel for her sins . Someone asks whether we should n't see this as a judgement on the Bosnians for their sins . This sounds like a replay of the old claim that we should n't have doctors or hospitals because illness is God 's judgement . Yes , even bad things may be used by God for good . That includes actions of bad people . But that doesn't justify them . If you read the prophets , you find them very clear that in attacking Israel , the Assyrians and Babylonians were acting as *unintentional* agents of God . Their intent was to attack God's people , and they would be judged for it . The fact that they were actually carrying out God 's plan did n't excuse their action . Furthermore , we should n't conclude from this that all attacks are judgements from God . God explicitly interpreted that case , through his prophets . As far as I know , he did not send any prophets to Bosnia . While I find it hard to see any good in the current fighting , I am sure God will eventually make good come out of bad . But that does n't justify it , and it wo n't save the people who are doing it from judgement . I am particularly concerned about the implications of this issue because of current tensions between the West and Moslem-oriented nations . What we do not need is for Moslems to conclude that Christians think it 's OK to kill Moslems . The implications for the mid-East , and even relations with American Moslems , could be quite serious .

From : MNHCC @ cunyvm.bitnet ( Marty Helgesen ) Subject : Public/Private Revelation ( formerly Re : Question about Virgin Mary Organization : City University of New York Lines : 35 Mark Ashley 's account of private revelation does not , as some might think , contradict my posting in which I said that the Catholic Church believes that public revelation , on which Catholic doctrine is based , ended with the death of St. John , the last Apostle . In that posting I made sure I used the word `` public '' . Public revelation contains God 's truth intended for everyone to believe . The revelation contained in the Bible is a significant subset of public revelation . Private revelation is revelation that God gives to an individual . He may speak directly to the individual , He may send an angel , or He may send the Virgin Mary or some lesser saint . The only person who is required to believe a private revelation is the person to whom it is revealed . Devotional practices may be based on reported private revelations , but doctrines can not . When an alleged private revelation attracts sufficient attention , the Church may investigate it . If the investigation indicates a likelihood that the alleged private revelation is in fact from God , it will be approved . That means that it can be preached in the Church . However , it is still true that no one is required to believe that it came from God . A Catholic is free to deny the authenticity of even the most well attested and strongly approved private revelations , such as those at Fatima and Lourdes . ( I suspect that few if any Catholics do reject Fatima and Lourdes , but if any do their rejection of them does not mean they are not orthodox Catholics in good standing . ) I do not have at hand a list of the criteria the Church uses in evaluating an alleged private revelation -- it 's not something I need every day -- but I know that one of the primary requirements is that nothing in the alleged private revelation can contradict anything known through public revelation -- -- -- - Marty Helgesen Bitnet : mnhcc @ cunyvm Internet : mnhcc @ cunyvm.cuny.edu '' What if there were no such thing as a hypothetical situation ?

The above is probably not the most representative paragraph , but I thought I 'd hop on , anyway ... What strikes me as self-contradicting in the fable of Lucifer's fall - which , by the way , I seem to recall to be more speculation than based on biblical text , but my ex RCism may be showing - is that , as Benedikt pointed out , Lucifer had perfect nature , yet he had the free will to `` choose '' evil . But where did that choice come from ? We know from Genesis that Eve was offered an opportunity to sin by a tempter which many assume was Satan , but how did Lucifer discover , invent , create , call the action what you will , something that God had not given origin to ? Also , where in the Bible is there mention of Lucifer 's free will ? We make a big fuss about mankind having free will , but it strikes me as being an after-the-fact rationalisation , and in fact , like salvation , not one that all Christians believe in identically . At least in my mind , salvation and free will are very tightly coupled , but then my theology was Roman Catholic ... Still , how do theologian explain Lucifer 's fall ? If Lucifer had perfect nature ( did man ? ) how could he fall ? How could he execute an act that ( a ) contradicted his nature and ( b ) in effect cause evil to exist for the first time ? -- Lucio de Re ( lucio @ proxima.Alt.ZA ) - tab stops at four .

I think you are vastly oversimplifying things . We know that early Christians suffered totures because of their witness to Christ . For example : ACT 5:40 His speech persuaded them . They called the apostles in and had them flogged . Then they ordered them not to speak in the name of Jesus , and let them go . ACT 5:41 The apostles left the Sanhedrin , rejoicing because they had been counted worthy of suffering disgrace for the Name . It appears that the Jewish rulers of that time had a particular aversion to even hearing Jesus 's name . ACT 5:28 `` We gave you strict orders not to teach in this name , '' he said . `` Yet you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and are determined to make us guilty of this man 's blood . '' Finally , the first apostle 's death , James of Zebedee was certainly not by Rome 's hand any more than the first martyr Stephen . > The idea of resurrection is one which can be found in a host of different > forms in the religions of antiquity . The problem was not the resurrection > which was a mediorce issue for a tiny fragment of the Jewish population The problem was that if one believed in the Resurrection , then one must believe in Jesus as truly being the Son of God and what He stood for and preached during His ministry on Earth .

He made some smart remark so I told him where he could stick it , > snatched back my check and left . Needless to say , they were not pleased by > the turn of events . That 's nothing . When a friend of mine went shopping for a small sedan a few years ago , she brought me along as a token male so the salespeople would n't give her the `` bimbo '' treatment . Her first choice was a Mazda 323 , and second choice was a Nissan Sentra . We went to a Mazda dealership and described what `` we '' wanted . We started negotiating on the price , and the salesdroid kept playing the `` let me run this price by the sales manager '' . After playing the `` good salesman , bad salesman '' game , we finally told him that if he did n't have the authority to negotiate a price , perhaps we should be speaking directly to someone who did . He brought in the sales manager who proceeded to dick us around with every trick in the book . ( Read Remar Sutton 's `` Do n't Get Taken Every Time '' for a list . ) Finally , after playing a few more rounds of `` you 'll have to work with us on this price '' , also known as `` each time you come up a thousand dollars we 'll come down ten '' , the salesmanager gave a signal to his two sales cronies , stood up , and said `` well , we ca n't come down any more so I guess we ca n't help you '' and they trouped out of the room , leaving us sitting in the salesman 's office all by ourselves . Hmm . I 'd read that sleazy salesmen sometimes bug their own offices so they can leave and listen in on couples discussing the sales offer , and I mentioned this aloud to my friend while we were sitting there wondering why they would leave us in the office instead of showing us to the door . For lack of anything better to do , I picked up the phone on the desk and called another Mazda dealership , asked for a salesman , and began discussing what kind of price they would consider . A few sentences into the conversation , Mr. Salesmanager broke into the line ( ! ) and began telling me how rude he thought it was that I would call another dealership from `` his '' phone ! I said that since he 'd announced that our business was over , he should n't care , and every time I tried to talk to the other sales guy the sales manager would drown out our voices with his own . ( How did he know that I was using the phone , anyway ? ) Finally , I hung up and we headed out of the showroom . Sales manager and cronies come out of a little unmarked room and he begins to berate us again . We say that we wo n't bother him anymore , we 're going next door to the Nissan dealership . Then comes the part I wish I could have videotaped . As we go out the front door , the sales manager SHOUTS across the entire showroom , customers and all , `` Go ahead ! You DESERVE to buy a Nissan ! '' So my friend bought a Sentra . Just so the guilty wo n't go unpunished , I 'll mention that the sales manager 's name was Gary Tusone . From his manner , his refusal to come down to a reasonable price , and his anger at the end , my guess is that he had bet our original salesman ( who was a young novice ) that he 'd be able to get at least X dollars out of us , and he was steamed that we would n't fall for his slimy tricks .

[ text deleted ] > Yes , sin can have terrible consequences , but we need to be *real* > careful when saying that the consequences are a *punishment* for > sin . I wish that you had followed this thread before jumping to conclusions . I have n't seen anybody write that AIDS was a *punishment* for certain types of sin ( this includes Mark Ashley who you were responding to here ) . I myself wrote that when you do n't do things God 's way that curses will come on you and others . Although one definition of 'curse' is 'retribution ' , I only meant 'harm or misfortune ' when I used the word . Because God loves us he has told us the best way to live in his Bible . God does n't cause curses , he warns us of them . Kevin Davis wrote ( a while ago ) : > Last week I was guilty of anger , jealousy , and whole mess of > other stuff , yet I am forgiven and not condemned to suffer with > AIDs . To even suggest that AIDS is `` deserved '' is ludicrous . The Bible makes it clear that we all equally deserve death ( which is much worse than AIDS ) -- we have all hurt God with our sin . Paul Conditt reveals his feelings : > In case you could n't tell , I get *extremely* angry and upset when > I see things like this . Instead of rationalizing our own fears and > phobias , we need to be reaching out to people with AIDS and other > socially unacceptable diseases . Whether they got the disease through > their own actions or not is irrelevant . They still need Jesus ... The first issue you bring up is your anger . It is `` obvious '' ly wrong to be angry ( Gal 5:19-20 ) for any reason , especially *extremely* angry which is on par with hatred . Jesus has every reason to be angry at us for putting him on the cross with our sin , yet his prayer was `` forgive them Father , they know not what they do . '' Knowing how forgiving Jesus has been with me calls me to be more forgiving with everyone out of love for Him . Please do n't give in to anger , it will only cause foolish quarrels and more bad feelings . It 's okay if you read something that bothers you , but you need to address it in a loving way . If right now , I felt like someone out there was saying that God punishes gay or sexually immoral people with AIDS because they deserve punishment that others do n't then I would frame a response something like this : '' It makes me feel very sad for someone to believe that AIDS , which is simply a harmful disease not so unlike any other , is God 's punishment for people who have committed certain sins . God loves all of his children equally and rejoices when a single one comes back to him . We will all be judged after we die , but until then we all have the opportunity to accept God 's grace by earnestly seeking after him with all of our hearts , believing the gospel 's testimony , repenting of our sin , confessing that Jesus is Lord at baptism , and living a new life for him . Let us not judge someone to be eternally condemned . God 's arm is not to short to save . He will do anything he can to move a hardened heart or a misled person . He works for the good of all men . Even through the worst of situations , he has set the times and places for all men that they may perhaps reach out and find him . '' The second issue you bring up is seeing people rationalize their fears of people with AIDS . Fortunately , what you describe as seeing is actually misperceiving . You have been missing the points made in the earlier posts and reacting in anger to attitudes that have n't been expressed . I know that its sometimes hard to discount your perceptions , but please try to be open-minded . You are quite correct in saying that we should reach out to all people because they all need Jesus . This is what my brothers and sisters and I do on a daily basis . If you would like to send me the name of the city and state you live in , I will find and get you in touch with some brothers who have AIDS or know people with AIDS and live nearby you so that you can see the loving attitudes for yourself . The third issue you bring up is the importance of how some individual contracted AIDS . How someone gets AIDS is only relevant to their salvation in that there may be repetence involved . The important point to be made , however , is that not listening to God's commands ( or advice or warnings ) , i.e . sinning , causes harm or misfortune to yourself and others . For this reason , a good way to prevent the misfortune of AIDS , which can be transmitted in sinful ways , is to listen to God 's advice and have sex only with your wife or husband . I hope that you are feeling better now , Paul . Love , Aaron Cardenas

From : jbh55289 @ uxa.cso.uiuc.edu ( Josh Hopkins ) Subject : RIMSAT , US/Russian joint venture Organization : University of Illinois at Urbana Lines : 121 I 've been to three talks in the last month which might be of interest . I 've transcribed some of my notes below . Since my note taking ability is by no means infallible , please assume that all factual errors are mine . Permission is granted to copy this without restriction . Michael Sternberg , Cheif of Operations of RIMSAT , was invited to speak at an informal lunch held by ACDIS here on the campus of the University of Illinois . ACDIS is an organization on campus that deals with Arms Control , Disarmament and International Security . RIMSAT was considered an appropriate topic because the company is using Russian launchers and satellites . I think it also helped that his daughter is a grad student in the International Relations program . The concept behind RIMSAT apparently began when Matt Neilson ( ? ) went to Tonga to visit a friend . While he was there , he somehow ended up visiting the king , who happened to be a big TV fan . Matt bought the King a satellite dish , which the king thought was really nifty . Since Tonga has a GNP of about $ 70 million , His Majesty asked if there was any way to make money off this . Matt thought there probably was , so at his suggestion , Tonga applied for 31 geosynchronous satellite slots . While this is n't entirely off the wall , it was very unusual , seeing as Tonga was a tiny kingdom with no space program , and 31 is a lot of slots . The whole thing was debated in the appropriate regulatory agency and Carl Hilliard ( who is apparently a respected space lawyer ) wrote several opinions supporting Tonga 's case . Eventually Tonga ended up with 7 slots , ranging from 70 E to 170 E ( slots are designated by the longitude over which they reside ) . According to Sternberg , four of these , from 130 E to 142 E are the best in the world because they are excellently placed for communications between Hawaii and the Pacific Rim . RIMSAT was formed to use these slots . It was officially formed in Nevis as a tax haven . They tried for a few years to raise funds in the west , however , to fill 7 slots with western satellites launched on western launchers would have cost approximately $ 2 billion . It 's not easy to raise that kind of money . Eventually , they hit upon the idea of using Russian hardware . They began negotiating with Glavkosmos for hardware . Mr Sternberg describes operating in Moscow in such harsh terms that I do n't think I 'll visit there for a long time . Besides a significant lack of creature comforts , he was not happy with the way that people operate . For example `` everybody can sell you everything . '' Everyone can show the proper documents and licenses that indicate they are the only ones who have the authority to sell what ever you want to by . Eventually , RIMSAT arranged a deal with Glavkosmos for 6 satellites at a cost of $ 150 million . However , Glavkosmos lost favor after the coup . Sternberg says that this is because they were basically a bunch of KGB operatives who went to trade shows and picked up lots of brochures . Since Glavkosmos was out of power , he had to renegotiate the deal with the new authorities . He again described life in a Moscow hotel in rather unfavorable terms . Eventually , he worked out a deal and on Dec 4 , 1992 he met with Koptev , who heads the Russian space program , to sign the deal . Koptev insisted on a few concessions before signing and according to Sternberg he arranged these new rules to allow himself to form another company to do the exact same thing as RIMSAT . The next step was to meet with the builders of the hardware , NPO Applied Mechanics -- NPO PM to use their acronym . This organization is located in Siberia ( ca n't figure out how to spell the town , I need an atlas ) and has built about 1500 vehicles since the dawn of the space age . Sternberg commented that siberians are very different from Musovites . They are hard workers , honest people who team up to get things done , very much like midwesterners . At this point there were some comments from the audience that agreed with his opinion on both siberians and midwesterners : - ) Sternberg had lots of good things to say about NPO PM . His company is apparently lookng for $ 100 million to invest in the firm to become 50 % partners.It apparently costs the Russians about $ 4 million to build a satellite that would sell for $ 50 million in the west . If you want to give them specifications , they 'll build you a satellite . For the particular satellites that RIMSAT will be using , costs run about $ 378,000 per transponder year . This compares to $ 810,000 t/y in the U.S . They can sell their time for about $ 1.1 million compared to $ 2.6 million in the U.S. RIMSAT will launch their satellites on Protons . To get the best prices , they bought in bulk . They have the rights to twelve launches , so if any of you need a lift I can give you their address . The first launch is scheduled for October and they are getting one used satellite from the Russians , which is being moved into place now . Tidbits : * Sternberg says this kind of thing has to be done by entrepreneurs , not big business because big business is just like what they have over there , except that `` we have better paper , both in the bathroom and in the copier . '' * Russian launches are self insured . The promise to replace a failed launch within 9 months . * Major investors in RIMSAT include Russell 20/20 , which is a huge retirement fund organization , Cellsat , which is a big telecom business in southeast Asia , and a fund operated by some of the big names in U.S aerospace which he says is sort of an insurance policy for them if this really takes off . * He downplayed the instabilites in the ex-USSR saying that we are worried partly because we are n't used to seeing Russia as anything but an unvarying monolith . Italy gets a new government `` every two weeks '' but we do n't worry because we 're used to it . He predicted that once we get used to seeing what really goes on in Russia we wo n't worry about their stability as much . * Part of the problem with cooperative ventures is the problem of transfering money . The central bank has a policy of taking hard currency payments , putting 25 % in their coffers and replacing the rest with the `` equivalent '' value in rubles . To get around this , RIMSAT pays their hard currency into an Austrian bank account . NPO PM then pays their contractors with foreign currency so that the only the contractors get swindled by the government . * One of the big problems RIMSAT has had is stonewalling by the western satellite industry . However , Intelsat recently bought three of the same type of satellites , which was rather reassuring . * The biggest worry most people have about russian satellites is the primitive technology and shorter lifetime . The older Gorizont ( Horizon ) satellites have a lifetime of about 5 years , while the more modern Express satellites compare well with western technology and last about 8 years . While this is much shorter than 15 years for western satellites , Sternberg downplayed the difference . At these prices they can afford to launch new ones . In addition , shorter lifetimes mean that they can replace their equipment with newer technology so they will be able to compete better than older , out of date hardware . -- Josh Hopkins jbh55289 @ uxa.cso.uiuc.edu `` Find a way or make one .

Actually I favor government funded research . It *is* a pump prime for a lot of basic technologies . I also understand the short term value of high tech welfare programs . But they ca n't substitute for long range wealth generation via commercial enterprise . That 's what's needed to maintain a healthy economy *anywhere* , on Earth or Luna .

A single chip micro and a crystal will do the job reliably and easily . An 8748 only costs about $ 5 . That and a $ 1 crystal and you 're in business . Embed the whole thing in a foam insulated blanket , power it from a solar cell , use the excess power to heat the assembly during the day and rely on the insulation to hold the heat during darkness . If you do n't want to try thermal management , contact someone like ICL and have them cut you a special low temperature crystal . It 'll cost at most $ 20 . If you use a single chip micro , you 're looking at a parts count of maybe 7 . A processor , a crystal , two caps on the crystal , a power FET to fire the solenoid a flyback diode and a battery . This is fewer parts than you can build an analog timer for and is infinitely more reliable . Add a power zener diode ( for heat ) and a solar cell and the parts count screams up to 9 . PD assemblers are available for all the common single chip micros . This application is so trivial you could even look up the op codes in the programmer 's guide and create the binary with a hex editor .

The big win with the V-1 is not its range but rather its directionality and multiple-transmitter tracking ( which you later called a `` gimmick '' -- a conclusion I disagree with ) . Since the detector incorporates multiple receivers it 's not surprising that it's significantly more expensive . While the added capabilities may not help you , there is added value for those of us who live in areas where there are a lot of false-alarms . > Summary : Valentine-1 way too expensive and not a significantly better > performer !

Very adequate radar detectors are available for less than half the cost and one of them has suited me rather well .

Internal examination indicates that the keycard is present , and there is one disk drive ( or at least one large single unit ) . Attempts to configure a second drive in CMOS result in drive not ready errors . Questions : ========= The software is Netware 286 Level II and I can see burnt on to the screen SFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a . However , to configure netware for level II ( mirrored or duplexed disks ) requires a second disk , yes ? So how is the Novell Server 286A normally configured ? 1 . Can I install SFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a as Level I , or is this what is causing my serialisation error ? 2 . Is the Novell Server 286A normally equipped with two hard drives , one of which has failed ? 3 . Would this mean I can not install the network software because it will not be serialised for this hardware with a failed drive ? 4 . What else can cause a serialisation error ? 5 . What happens if the keycard fails ? 6 . Am I doing something wrong ? Can someone knowledgeable offer some comments and guides . Thanks for your time . Apology : ======= I appreciate that I have posted this request somewhat widely . As I'm dealing with somewhat archaic hardware and software I 'm hoping that by casting my net further , I 'm more likely to capture someone who has met this system before .

I 've got an Emerson VCR which is # 6 in the series . Returned it six times for various and never the same problems . Got tired of taking it back and fixed it myself .

Nntp-Posting-Host : spot.colorado.edu Organization : University of Colorado , Boulder Lines : 47 [ From Kalat , J.W.. ( 1992 ) : _Biological Psychology_ . Wadsworth Publishing Co. Belmont , CA . Pg . 219 . Reproduced without permission . ] Digression 6.1 : Miracle Berries and the Modification of Taste Receptors Although the _miracle berry_ , a plant native to West Africa is practically tasteless , it temporarily changes the taste of other substances . Miracle berries contain a protein , _miraculin_ , that modifies sweet receptors in such a way that they can be stimulated by acids ( Bartoshuk , Gentile , Moskowitz , & Meiselman , 1974 ) . If you ever get a chance to chew a miracle berry ( and I do recommend it ) , for about the next half an hour all acids ( which are normally sour ) will taste sweet . They will continue to taste sour as well . Miraculin was , for a time , commercially available in the United States as a diet aid . The idea was that dieters could coat their tongue with a miraculin pill and then eat and drink unsweetened , slightly acidic substances . Such substances would taste sweet without providing many calories . A colleague and I once spent an evening experimenting with miracle berries . We drank straight lemon juice , sauerkraut juice , even vinegar . All tasted extremely sweet . Somehow we forgot how acidic these substances are . We awoke the next day to find our mouths full of ulcers . [ ... continued discussion of a couple other taste-altering substances ... ] Refs : Bartoshuk , L.M. , Gentile , R.L. , Moskowitz , H.R. , & Meiselman , H.L .

I 'll point out that the whole point of the difficult amendment process was to require a super-majority to change the Supreme Law , making it impossible for a `` majority '' of the people to simply change the law on a whim . Simply changing the meaning based on `` the representatives '' of the people effectively destroys the amendment process .

Sure , but the surface condition of most good autobahns is far better than most of the roads here . A dip in the asphalt that you test your shocks on at 60 will kill you at 130 .

Before you post a text in reply investigate its context . First of all , `` ceremonial law '' is an extraScriptural term . It is sometimes used as a framework to view Scripture . But if you look at Collosions , without going into it with the assumption that the Sabbath can not be a ceremonial law , you will see that it does refer to the sabbath . Paul writes in Collosions 2:14-17 how that Christ nailed the laws that were against us to His cross , and therefore we should not be judged in what what food we eat , what we drink , the keeping of new moons and holy days , or the keeping of the sabbath . The word for sabbath in this verse is `` sabbaton '' and is used throughout the New Testament to refer to the 7th day . If there is any Scripture from which we get the idea of the ceremonial law , this is one of them , and the sabbath is listed among the ceremonial laws . If one goes into this with the fundamental assumption `` the sabbath can not be a ceremonial law '' then he will have to find some way around it , like saying that this can only refer to the other sabbath holy days besides the 7tH day , Because `` the sabbath can not be a ceremonial law . '' But Paul is very careful in his letters to add some kind of parenthetcal statement if there is anything that can be seen as a liscence to sin in his writings . Also , why is the sabbath absent from the epistles ( except for Hebrews 4 , which talks about the rest that comes through faith ? ) Surely it would have been a big problem for first century Christians living in a society that did not rest on the 7th day . Especially slaves . Many new converst were slaves . It would have been difficult for slaves to rest on the sabbath if it had been mandatory . Why is there no mention of this in the epistles ?

I merely said > that he is n't the best GM in hockey- or even a contender for that honor . > If Murray is as great as you claim- the Wings would have won the Stanley Cup > by now- probably more than once . If he was as great a GM as you claim I think you missed one of my points there . It takes *more* than a great GM to win a stanley cup , even once . Some of the guys on the list you gave earlier never won one . I agree that you and I could probably argue back and forth for days to no avail about who is the best GM in hockey- that is a matter of opinion , and who is to say my opinion is any better than yours or yours than mine ? But the point of my *original* original post ( if not well stated ) was that Murray has the GM abilities but not the coaching abilities . Which leads to below : > and he was as poor a coach as you claim- he would have been intelligent > enough to hire the coach to push the team to the next level of success . I think at this point there 's a personal , emotional element involved here which transcends Murray 's logical thought . As outsiders , it 's fine for us to say , `` He should hire a different coach . '' In fact , he has talked about doing so in the past . But , the press ( here in Detroit , at least ) has so built up this business about Murray never getting past the second round of the playoffs as a coach , that I think he has taken it upon himself to prove to the world that he *is* capable of coaching a team past the second round . He needs to , as the papers say , `` get that monkey off his back . '' So it becomes a matter not of intelligence , but of pride . Is it foolish to let pride stand in the way of sound logic ? Perhaps , but we 're all a little that way from time to time . I think eventually he 'll step down from behind the bench and concentrate on his GM duties , and the team will improve as a result . I think his coaching duties take away time he might have otherwise spent on GM work . In that sense , once he steps down as coach , we 'll see how good of a GM he really is . > But Murray is an average ( unspectacular ) NHL coach and a pretty good GM > so none of this is true anyway . I may not agree with everything you 've said , but it 's been fun discussing it with you . > Gregmeister -- Randy

For example , is this a public key system or a private key system ? If the latter , then I do n't see how the system could work ( given that the keys are tied to the device and not the person ) . Further , the escrowed 80-bit keys are split into two 40-bit chunks . I would guess that the availability of one of these 40-bit chunks and a reasonable key-search machine , would allow you to read the traffic . I 'm not suggesting that this is a deliberate weakness of the system , but it does make you think . Of course , this is easily fixable by giving out two 80-bit chunks which could be x-ored to generate the real 80-bit key . Philip

By far the ( still ) best method to diagnose a hernia is old fashioned physical examination . If you have an obvious hernia sac coming down into your scrotum , or a bulge in your groin that is brought about by increasing intra-abdominal pressure ... . Sometimes is not that obvious . The hernia is small and you can only detect it by putting your finger into the inguinal canal . Whether you have a recurrent hernia , or this is related to the previous operation , I ca n't tell you . The person that examined you is in the best position to make that determination . Are there non-invasive ways of diagnosing a hernia ? Every now and then folks write about CT scans and ultrasounds for this . But these are far too expensive , and unlikely to be better than a trained examining finger . ==================================== Howard Doyle doyle+ @ pitt.edu

Sorry . Wrong . This is how banks got started in the first place . Sooner or later your father and his pals will lend money to someone who eventually goes broke , and then they will realise that they hav n't been managing risk very well . Then they will ask themselves what it is that they need to quantify risk , and to persuade borrowers not to take on greater loans than they can carry . And since they do n't all want the worry of doing the calculations and handling the money , some of them will specialise in that . Then they 'll reinvent interest , but like good Muslims , they 'll call it something else . | > | > The fact is Leonard it DOES work without a fluffy bunny in sight ! | > iThat is the beauty of Islam .

The trap is the easy way out . For yourself , I think it would be a good idea to realize that the demographics related to the crimes you speak of have less to do with race , and much to do with socioeconomic status and disenfranchisement . You're going to find higher crime within *any* community comprised of *any* ethnic group or subgroup that has become dysfunctional , whatever the factors leading to that dysfunction . With ethnic minorities it is more usually than not , as I said , socioeconomic disenfranchisement . If , for example , you lived in an area where there were very few Blacks , but quite a few poor-for-generations Whites , you 'd see the crime statistics reflecting the dysfunction of those White people . Would you then worry about whther your children would begin to see Whites as undesireable or whatever ? The trap springs into action when our innate compunction to define `` us '' and `` other '' raises its little voice . The trap becomes dangerous when we stop to listen to that little voice and stop thinking like rational humans . It 's interesting that Blacks are traditionally seen as *the* or the *most* criminal element in many of our urban areas . I do n't know the racial makeup of Phoenix , so I ca n't speak to your situation . However , I live in San Francisco , a city that loves to tout its `` ethnic diversity '' . Here , we have Black gangs , Hispanic gangs , Asian ( yes , the `` model minority '' ) gangs , and even a few White gangs . The Asian gangs have become a particularly troublesome element for law enforcement here , mainly due ( I think ) to their propensity for engaging in organized criminal activities . But ask people on the street and they 'll , 8-out-of-10 times , tell you that Black gangs and crime are what they most fear . During the `` disturbance '' in Los Angeles last year many of the rioters and looters were not Black . Some were even White ! I remember being amazed at television news scenes that showed looting mobs where there were maybe one or two Blacks at most ! My perceptions , gleaned from TV news , were further corroborated by numerous friends and relatives that live in Los Angeles . This may have been the country 's first truly multi-ethnic riot . Yet I know from face-to-face and online discussion that in the minds of America the popular perception is that it was a *Black* riot ! In closing , I 'd like to say that you raise some interesting points that really need discussion . Our country has spent too long ignoring the racism ( and its attendant ills ) that is very much a part of our culture . As a people , we are afraid to face up to some hurtful truths , and the problem becomes compounded *daily* . We can not afford to do it much longer . I truly believe that the well-being of ALL OF US depends on changing our current course of denial and repression . I wish you and your children , and all other people , of *all* colors , luck in avoiding the `` trap '' .

The Braves have two catchers who have demonstrated solid > > abilities to call games , to work with the pitchers , to throw out > > runners . This is the crux of the argument ( to me at least ) . Both the SDCN and the non-SDCN camps seem to agree on the fact that a catcher's defense is basically nonmeasurable at present . You can talk about how important calling a game is , or framing the pitches , or blocking balls in the dirt . But there is little or no way to tell exactly how various catcher 's rank in `` defense '' . Looking at Lopez specifically ; is there any reason to suspect that he is a bad defensive catcher other then the fact that the Braves ( or the media ) has labeled him a bad defensive catcher ? As far as I can tell he does n't have any particular problem in his mechanics ( such as Sasser ) . He might be a little rough around the edges in blocking the ball , or framing the pitch to get a good call but all he needs to clear that up is playing and practice time . I ca n't see how repetitions at AAA are any better then reps in the majors ! All we 're left with is the calling the game aspect . Olsen and Berryhill at always given credit for calling good games and helping the pitchering staff . But this is a reputation that is given to almost all veteran catchers . How is catching at AAA going to help Lopez learn the major league pitching staff ? The only way any catcher is going to learn Tom Glavine 's pitches is to catch Tom Glavine . Similarly , I wouldn't be supprised if the pitcher 's claimed to prefer pitching to Olsen over pitching to Lopez because they are used to pitching to Olsen . But given time they will say they are comfortable with Lopez . Now , since Lopez ca n't learn how to handle the major league pitcher 's while he 's in AAA and since he does n't have any glaring problem in his mechanics , what is he going to learn in AAA that he ca n't learn just as well while in the majors ?

You think that 's bad ... one year , we had all three New York teams in the playoffs and the cableco operator ( SCNY once shared a channel with BET but someone forgot to throw the switch at 6PM ) did n't know what I was talking about ... While it 's nice that the NHL is back on American network TV , it faces the same problems as it did with the All Star game . Local preemptions and zero promotion ( okay , I do n't watch that much TV so I 'm just foaming all right ? ) . The league should have made sure that it was solid on cable before going to the networks . In year one of the new ESPN contract , the saturation coverage of SCA ( all other games shown to completion , like the Quebec-Montreal and Sabres-Bruins overtimes ) is missed around here . gld -- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Je me souviens ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Gary L.

I am going absolutely INSANE . > I wan na know if the problem is MY Duo , or all Duo 210s , or all Duos , > or just me . > Hmmm ... Sounds vaguely similar to a problem I had a long time ago when I was trying to use Kermit . I was building a serial connection between my Duo 210 and my NeXT . I think the problem was in the handshaking . Basically , you need to make sure that the handshaking protocol is the same on both sides . A safe place to start is by selecting NO handshaking on either end . One problem is that the Zilog serial chip seems to get permanently wedged if you talk to it wrong , and only a reset will clear it . I do n't know the specifics . But this could be a nonlinearity that screws up your attempts at debugging the system . It could very well be that you are doing things right -- eventually -- but one wrong move ( like trying a bad handshaking protocol ) can screw up any further correct actions , until the next machine reset . I have wedged my Mac and also my NeXT that way . Now I can send files back and forth between the Duo and the NeXT without any problem , and at pretty high speeds too . I do n't know what kind of chip the PC uses , but I think the Zilog 8530 is pretty standard . Hope this helps , -Avery

And yet , Jayne , as we read the Gospels and in particular the topics that Jesus himself spoke on , Hell figures in a large % of the time -certainly more than heaven itself . Paul , as we learn in I Thess , taught new believers and new churches eschatology and did not hesitate to teach hell and damnation . Rev , chapter 20:11-15 is very specific and can not be allegorized . I think the word '' throne '' is used 45 times in Rev and that the unbelieving come to receive the assignment of the severity of judgement , for in John 3 we read that they are already judged . Rom 3 speaks that every mouth will be shut . There is no recourse , excuse or defense . > > I see evangelism as combining a way of living that shows God 's love with > putting into words and explaining that love . Preaching the Gospel > without living the Gospel is no better than being a noisy gong or a > clanging cymbal . Yes I agree with you . Life is often like a pendulum where it swings to extremes before stopping at `` moderation . '' I think we have seen the extreme of the `` hell fire & brimstone '' preacher , but also we have seen the other extreme where hell not talked about at all for fear of offending someones sensibilities . I forget who founded the Word of Life Ministries , but I remember him telling a story . He was in a small town hardware store and some how a man got to the point of telling him that he did n't believe in Satan or hell . He believed everybody was going to heaven . It was at this point that the man was asked to pray to God that He would send his children to hell ! Of course the man would n't do it . But the point was made . Many people say they do n't believe in hell but they are not willing to really place their faith in that it doesn't exist . If this man had , he would of prayed the prayer because hell didn't exist and there would have been no fear in having his prayer answered . And yet , they walk as if they believe they will never be sent there . I 'd use a different illustration however . I have to include myself in it . When I watch , say a Basketball ( go Bulls ! ) game , and I see a blatant foul that is n't called , oi vey ! . What 's with that ref that he did n't make that call . It 's unfair . And just so in life , righteousness demands payment . As the surgeon takes knife in hand to cut the cancer away , so God cuts off that which is still of the old creation . We must preach the Gospel in all its richness which includes the fact that if you reject The Way and The Truth and The Life , then broad is the way to distruction . > > Here 's a question : How many of you are Christians because you are > afraid of going to Hell ? How many are responding to God 's love ? I think I would fall in there somewhere . Actually it was both . After all , repentance is n't only a turning towards , but also a turning away from ! No , again , if Jesus used it in His ministry then I can surely see that we should do it also . In love , of course , but in truth most assuredly . I have thought about writing something on this topic , but not now and here . I would say that there are some good reasons for its existence and its eternality . 1 ) God is Light . Yes He is love , but His love has the boundary of Holiness . 2 ) Dignity of Man . Either a man is a robot or he is a responsible creature . If responsible , then he is also accountable . 3 ) The awfulness of sin . Today we have a poor , poor concept of sin & God . 4 ) Christ . He was willing to die and go there Himself to offer an avenue to the `` whosoever will . '' -- Rex

' Obviously , it is no research center of any kind , unless 'researching ' published documents to find material to use against Israel makes it so . Labeling a propaganda mill a research center is not surprising in itself . That is simply part of the propaganda process . I was curious if anyone knew who this anti-Israel fanatic hiding behind his phoney 'research center ' name is . Is he an Arab ? Is he some typical anti-semite hiding behind a veneer of 'anti-zionism ? ' Is he some Jew who perhaps lived in Israel and just could n't make it there , and is now taking his failure out on Israel ? Let 's shed some light on this clown once and for all . It will help put his nonsense in the proper perspective .

Yes this is possible . Technically , you only need to take out 2 of the VRAM SIMMs but leaving in the other two will not get you anything because the 950 can not really do anything with 1.5MB of VRAM . It only knows 1MB and 2MB . > From the documentation I have , the Quadra 800 must get 1 Mo VRAM to have > 16-bit color , is that correct ? Yes , this is correct . You get to 1MB by putting 2 256k VRAM SIMMs into the VRAM SIMM slots on the Q800 's motherboard . > Bonus question : where do VRAM SIMMs hide ?
