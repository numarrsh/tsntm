love this backpack , it 's working great for me so far only issue at this point is that it seems to have all the bells and whistles but is lacking something to attach the tripod to it
this is the only choice if you have a # & # # ; laptop and a dslr it 's pretty good it protects its contents very well -lrb- we even used it to bring <unk> <unk> on an international flight -rrb- a + for construction quality and good compartment design - # star for ` decent ' -lrb- not stellar -rrb- <unk> with my back despite reasonably comfortable straps , it lacks the ergonomics of a military grade backpack and since you 're probably carrying around # lbs of stuff , it does matter after a few hours
i purchased this bag about # months ago the first time i really use it is on my recent trip to china and hong kong not only it holds my camera gear nicely i am also able to put my portable dvd and netbook on the top compartment since i only brought my netbook with me , i really did n't have to use the laptop compartment instead , i use it to hold all my travel documents it is a very durable bag , i have it with me almost every moment the only thing i do n't like is that it is a a bit heavy other than that , after a # weeks long travel and having it with me everyday , there is no sign of wear
after reading up on this bag , it was exactly what i was looking for i was looking for a bag that can carry my laptop and my dslr and be able to be used as a carry-on bag for my trip to <unk> i have read some reviews before i purchased this bag , and the only one i can <unk> with is that it can get heavy but what do you expect if you are carrying a <unk> , lenses , extra battery , laptop , external hard drive , chargers and other peripherals as well so being heavy means this thing can carry a lot of stuff for it 's total packed weight , the bag is quite comfortable
i like this little <unk> but it do n't hold as much as i like i had to rearrange my gear to fit and only carry what is needed durable and comfortable i 'm sure it will wear on me .
it met my expectation and the quality is good i am glad that i bought it for my long overseas trip it is quite roomy the only think i miss is pocket storage on the side
it works fine for me the price was right and it was delivered as promised it is designed for only one camera and a couple of lenses and a flash probably not the best for a pro , but i am an amateur
i 've been using the lowepro fastpack # for over a year and recently added the # i generally shoot with one dslr and a couple of lenses if you are just going shooting , the # is a better choice ; it 's significantly thinner , so it 's easier to swing the bag around and access the camera compartment the benefit of the # , though , is that it 's big enough to be my single carry-on bag for a day or weekend trip the laptop compartment can fit a few clothes -lrb- it 's just barely big enough for one of those eagle creek folders for shirts -rrb- and a netbook the camera compartment has enough extra space for a camera , lenses , battery charger , and toiletries the roomy top compartment fits snacks , a hat , a book , sunglasses , and other miscellaneous travel stuff if you like to travel light on short trips , this is a nice camera and travel bag in one , keeping your camera safe and easy to access
the quality of this bag is top notch and it works well i did not know it was going to be as big as it is its not too big for me being over six feet tall and around # pounds my # ' # `` # pound better half is too small for it unless she needs to bring all her shooting gear and more it is not enough of an <unk> to make me send it back but if i were to replace it down the road when it wore out , i would buy the #
this is a very good product the space , <unk> and the laptop area really met my <unk> and having owned other lowepro bags , i 'm pretty sure this one will last long
i have a lot of stuff and am pretty much a <unk> on location the fastpack # makes it easy to load everything associated with my working camera it does take some thought to decide how best to arrange the interior for best access , though
i have used this bag several times now and its exactly what i needed i can see why some might complain there is not enough space for cameras and lenses but in the description it tells you what it holds i was suprised at how much i could fit in the space designed for the notebook or laptop its a lightweight bag that has enough compartments for about anything you could take on a short trip it was well worth my investment
someone seriously gave this bag a one star rating ? this bag is very well made , plenty of room for both of my cameras and lenses to include their battery charging accessories i know you might not want to spend $ # on it , but this is easily a $ # - $ # bag
i have had several backpack style camera bags over the past # years this is the best one i have owned or used it is a good size in that i can fir the camera body , lenses and other equipment i need without cramming stuff into the bag getting to the things you need while out shooting is easy and efficient no more having to take the bag off every time you need something , what to change a lens etc . i also find this bag very comfortable to wear , when fully loaded and for the full duration of a hike or shoot
this is a well built backpack and i highly recommend it the side entry to the camera storage area is a great feature that gives easy access to the camera without having to worry about dumping out any of your gear
needed a large bag in this one i can carry my d # , d # with a lens attached , plus # other lens and my sb- # <unk> there is still room for personal items
so far this bag has been great , i have used it for a couple of photo shoots and travel so far i will update this later next year after i get back from a <unk> trip to <unk> to let everyone know how well it held up
this is a great bag it holds all of my gear for a day 's hike and is comfortable for a long day i have even used it for my carry-on with my computer , camera and several lenses & accessories
i am extremely happy with this purchase it is big but very light it holds my cannon t # i , all # lenses , external mic , # batteries , <unk> , bad weather <unk> , laptop with all the laptop accessaries and much more it is heavy with all the gear but has great support straps across the front which really helps the back also , if no laptop in laptop holder , then tripod can be carried with one leg in the laptop slot -lrb- works great -rrb- again , lots of storage and ergonomically easy to carry only downfall would be that the camera compartments are not easy to get to on the fly and camera can fall out very easily if you try
this is a great backpack for travel because you can fit lots of lenses in here , plus your camera , plus your laptop it also doubles as a nice day pack - you can stuff the top full of things it has just enough room to fit an ipad -lrb- laying vertically -rrb- , to give you and idea of the size there 's also nifty compartments all around the bag to stuff things into , plus a nice place to put a thermos , umbrella , or <unk> -lrb- like a <unk> -rrb- overall very nice i originally got it because i needed some bag to hold my # mm lens this one fits it , even while it 's still attached to the body
i wanted a `` <unk> `` pack for my photo gear , not too large and not too small : `` just right `` i also did not require a pouch for a laptop with this bag -lrb- which it lacks -rrb- i 'm pleased with my choice of the lowepro fastpack # in addition to it 's just right size , i like the fact that it is not accessible by others -lrb- zipper side is against your back -rrb- i also like how , if you have the waist belt fastened , you can slip it off your shoulder , swing it around to the front and access the inside without laying it down on the ground i 'm able to carry a crazy amount of gear in mine -lrb- more than i really should carry -rrb- i also like that it has a catch on it for <unk> ultimate <unk> rig
fits almost of my gear -lrb- might have too much gear if it does n't al fit -rrb- everything is well protected and has a place in the pack a bit more than i planned on for a camera bag but , worth it ! ! !
exactly what i needed , very light , enough space and cushion carry around my nikon d # with lens attached , there is also a nice space for a lap top or my ipad . , the price is great , highly recommend ! ! i would buy it again
comfortable to carry , basic features more than adequate , black zipper pulls against black case hard to locate easily good adjustable spaces for basic lenses and camera body well-padded makes me comfortable scrambling over rocks or <unk> off <unk> like the fact that it does n't make one conspicuous about carrying camera gear i 'd likely recommend to a friend
only about # % of the volume -lrb- bottom half -rrb- of the backpack was dedicated to photography gear this bag would be more suited to a day trip , hiking , etc . where you would desire to carry <unk> or clothing along with your camera gear in the unpadded top half of the backpack unfortunately the top half would offer little protection for camera bodies , lenses , etc . also , i could not use it to carry my # & # # ; laptop as another reviewer indicated the top half -lrb- internal -rrb- of the compartment had a significant amount of & # # ; dropped stitching & # # ; i did not expect this from a very well known brand & i fully believe that this is an exception involving this one item which <unk> their quality control folks
this definitely did the job and provided quick access to my camera when needed -lrb- loved that part of the pack . the only reason i did n't give it a perfect score is because it was heavy and bigger than i needed for some of the hikes and <unk> i did it fit perfectly in an overhead cabin for the plane ride and i love the laptop access - best carryon option for cameras yet i could have used a smaller bag for hiking trips , and wonder if the # would have been better for me or something else entirely another thing that would make this bag perfect is if the waist straps could be tucked in somewhere if not being used i did n't need if for all my hikes and it really got in the way i would like a separate phone pocket on it as well all in all , it is the best bag i 've <unk> , i 'm a person that knows exactly what i 'd like in a design , and this came closest to what i <unk>
i ordered this bag to replace a smaller tamrac no complaints about tamrac , it has held up well i recently purchased a # `` macbook pro that i wanted to carry with my camera and gear from time to time it fits snugly into the lowepro # a lot of extra storage for cables , books , media cards , etc etc . ... on the front of the bag and the top using for about a month now and seems to be well constructed great for the laptop and camera gear all together i carry a nikon d # along with five lenses , and all of it fits without a problem into the compartment designed to carry the camera and lenses
the zipper broke in # places and lowepro replaced the backpack with a brand-new one for free this pack fits nicely in the overhead bins of <unk> aircraft the top compartment is tapered -lrb- that is , has a <unk> cross section -rrb- so that it fits overhead bins this reduces the capacity of the top compartment so if you do not plan to carry this pack onboard aircraft , you can choose a bigger bag the lower compartment carries all my gear , including dslr , # lenses , external hard disk , power adaptors , cables , filters , and so forth the filter pockets on the outside of the lower compartment are not well padded i broke by filter cases a few times now my filters stay in the lower compartment
already own a lowepro slingshot which is great but just not big enough for my nikon d # and # mm lens this bag carries the body + big lens as well as flash , # and # mm lenses there is still plenty of room for binoculars too this bag does the trick for all camera needs and carries a # inch mac laptop fits easily inside a standard airplane overhead bin only downside is that the bag can carry so much stuff it gets pretty heavy
this is a great camera bag plenty of space for all your accessories only one problem , camera slides around in compartment a little to much , but a little well placed foam and velcro take care of that problem the computer compartment is great , well padded and protected
this lowepro product replaces a smaller camera bag that became too small with the new camera and lens it seems to be well made , though a bit bulkier than i had thought it is well padded , and the internal compartments can be <unk> to provide appropriate spacing for the lenses , flash and other accessories the straps are comfortable , though have yet to comfortably figure out how to get the camera out without completely removing the backpack
this is a great pack for a first <unk> with a cannon t- # rebel with extra lens , smaller camera and gear it is worth the money , having traveled with it as a a carry on , and taken it on walks
this pack is comfortable , has a compartment for everything & is perfect for my needs i did my research before buying & this pack lives up to its high standards
a great bag compact for its size , i can carry my d- # with # mm f/ # . # lens , # mm f/ # . # lens and flash in the lower section upper section has plenty of room for my kata <unk> , windbreaker and <unk> cap , which is accessable with ease this is extremely handy , especially when the weather takes a turn during <unk> games my # -inch laptop fits in the side pouch with no problem all that gear can be heavy , but shoulder straps are padded and the hip and sternum straps help to distribute the weight correctly unlike other combo bags that i 've owned , which were much wider , this fastpack # is compact and should be no problem being a carry-on for taking along on plane trips i highly recommend this bag
i bought this because my camera bag was to small for what i have nikon d # and # lens plus a flash and other things i have room for everything and more
the durability , ease of use , convenience of how easy to get my camera out of the side is awesome thank you for making such a great product the shipping was super fast too
... a compact backpak allowing me to carry my nikon d # , two lenses , a flash unit , a battery charger , some memory cards and a basic lens cleaning kit that 's all i wanted but i have serious doubts about the material it 's made of use will tell
wanted to originally purchase a bag that would allow me to carry my # d and a few lenses so that i could have a lightweight back that would be easy to lug around the airport or while hiking thought the fastpack # would be the best bag for me based on the product description and some of the other reviews i have seen online however once i received the bag and used it for a few weeks , i determined it really was n't the way to go the primary issues i had with the bag are actually comfort the straps themselves are not very comfortable at all with minimal padding , they started to hurt my shoulders after less than an hour there also was not much cushioning on the pad on the back of the bag itself which led not only to comfort issues but ventilation issues the construction of the bag is fine , nothing to complain about on that end but decided my journey to finding a good bag would continue after using this one
this back pack is perfect ! it fits the camera with the standard lense and an extra one and you might still have some space for sunglasses , wallet , etc . it protects teh camera but its not <unk>
my <unk> really liked this gift his camera is much easier to carry around now and the pack has a lot of extra space that he is able to carry his extra lenses and anything else he wants
i 'm more than pleased with how this backpack holds up i 've used it a couple times now on a hiking trip and it was perfect i was able to carry my dslr -lrb- cannon t # , starter one -rrb- and # bottles of water and was more than enough it 's very comfortable to carry around and has very easy access to the camera
i wanted something that would hold all my gear , but still felt small and compact the bag only covers about half my back , and leaves lots of room for my skin to breath i took the bag on a # hour hike in <unk> and the bag never bothered me once carried all my equipement plus a couple water bottles those <unk> # oz bottles with filter that you always see at target fit perfectly into the side mesh pocket i usually pack my t # i with two lenses down below , and a # rd lens up top access is extremely easy and quick my only complaint is that the top is just barely too small for my ipad to fit , though an ipad mini probably would fit
i have been using this product for more than # months now i use this for my d # camera fits it just fine i do n't have a second lens but would imagine even another would fit in nice the bag is not too heavy and comfortable to carry the upper portion of the bag can be used to store accessories if you are going on a day long trip and do not wish to carry another bag , the upper zip is enough to carry a small bottle of water & a towel maybe
i just bought this bag and the nikon d # with the # mm and the # mm lenses and the camera fits perfectly with the # mm lens attached and the # mm stored the extra lens is a little snug but i like it better that way so it does n't shift too much the bag is very well made and very comfy to wear it is very roomy too , the bottom half stores your camera and lens , & extra sd cards the top half could store extra gear like your charger travel tripod , etc but i will be using it for keys , snacks , water bottle , etc . for when we go hiking and traveling over all great backpack and would def . recommend to others
i took this backpack with me on two trips <unk> and loved how easy it was to carry my nikon d # and two lenses with me this is the smallest version of the lowepro fastpack series and i wanted something small and convenient i managed to travel through amsterdam and hong kong with relative ease the top storage area was large enough to hold my ipod , filters , and other accessories i bought mine for $ # on amazon the only thing i was a little bummed about was later finding this same exact bag brand new for $ # on ebay !
this bag is great for running around town , the <unk> , etc . you do n't have to set the bag down and keep an eye on it , you can swing it around easily and get access to the camera , and you have great storage above the camera compartment the cel phone pouch is too small for my iphone but i got over that
i absolutely love this kindle cover my kindle # is my favorite book -lrb- of course -rrb- and i no longer have to worry about the screen getting scratched or damaged this cover is fantastic , and was very inexpensive relative to the quality i highly recommend getting this one , as opposed to the more expensive ones you can download a lot of books with all the money you 'll save happy reading =
i just bought my first digital slr , and needed a medium size bag to store it along with all the accessories this lowepro fastpack was recommended by a friend , and i could n't be happier it is very well built , and though i 've only had it for a few weeks , it looks like it will hold up well there is ample storage for your slr body and a couple lens , along with all your accessories there are dedicated pockets for batteries , sd cards , lens caps , pens , etc . there is even a cell phone pocket on one of the shoulder straps but , the bag is not over-sized by any means it is very lightweight and comfortable to wear the main camera pocket has adjustable inserts to get a perfect fit you wo n't be disappointed with this bag , i highly recommend it
it 's good at what it 's supposed to do . nice and simple got it about a year ago i use it mostly for travel its easy to get the lap top in and out at the tsa check point holds a few extras which is nice . & i always get `` oh , girl that bag is so cute ! where did you get it ? `` and `` <unk> bag envy ! `` which is fun and a nice perk . <unk> great for the price
i bought this bag for my wife for christmas from amazon warehouse deals it was as described in the listing in fact , it was in better shape than i thought it would be everything works good her complaint about the bag is that there is not enough space in it to carry everything that she would like to therefore she has to also carry an additional briefcase with her not a big deal , but would be nice if there was more available space in the bag it was a great price and well worth it
many trips to the mall , discount stores and disappointments -lrb- bottom ripping , ugly , too small , too huge -rrb- - then i started looking <unk> after all , we take the time to shop , why not take the time to research i found the acme made website - found the perfect bag , and then bought it at amazon for half the price laptop , several files and cords , projector cords , etc . all fit , along with a zippered cosmetic -lrb- i think -rrb- bag for <unk> touch ups for someone who does presentations on the fly , this is the perfect laptop and accessory carry-all
love love love this bag it can carry way more than i initially thought plus , its very stylish and the colors are great too i have not seen anyone else with this bag which was a big thing for me when i bought it it fits everything that i need , including my laptop , powercord , <unk> dish filled with lunch and a <unk> cup -lrb- not to mention my other <unk> -rrb- told you it fits lots of stuff i 've tied a cute flower on it to add a little flair i 'm constantly getting compliments on it . this is a great buy
very well done case with one major flaw - no built-in card reader another <unk> is the front panel power connector that <unk> the main motherboard power connector overall , this is a very nice case for a high-end htpc
i really enjoy this htpc case the fans that come with it are quiet it 's very easy to get to know the controls it 's sleek looking and after hours of searching for a case , this one does n't disappoint one downside , when info is scrolling on the front lcd , it can become a little hard to read because of it is blurry not a killer for me but something to consider i 'm sure this is an issue for a lot since the lcd on most of these cases are the same kind of like a cheap car radio display
great htpc case nice and roomy easy to build out the front lcd is nearly impossible to read and the software that controls it is pretty much useless in <unk> # i was unable to get the front buttons working , and the volume never worked while using the built-in ir receiver if i was buying this again i would get the one without the front lcd front usb door and cd door are solid construction and work well good air flow and built like a tank
feels great inside , super soft and snug fit to perfectly protect laptop . the bonus bag for cords is great . the shoulder strap design is cool looking and creative and comfortable color is perfect , easy to keep clean looking , and surface wipes down great good amount of pockets for a few extra items ... not too much extra space but i think that is safer bc then you do n't have a bunch of junk knocking around with your computer great great bag ! !
this bag stores my computer safely and is very easy to use i like the long strap on it that provides a comfortable way to carry my laptop it is perfect if you have a bigger laptop like mine
good bag , fits a lot of stuff for its size i 've been using it for over # years the only thing happened to it is that one seam broke in a little part but the bag still works fine
i can carry a # inch macbook , my ipad in an otterbox case , and a wireless mac keyboard with ease i still have room for blank disks , a couple thin notebooks , and all my needed cables it 's wonderfully padded and feels great on my shoulder i 'll never use any other bag for my precious mac 's i even gave one to a friend for <unk> and she <unk> it for her macbook and ipad .
i loved this bag really loved it until only # or # months into usage , both main compartment zippers frayed and broke off the seams they are not designed to last because of the way the way the bag is shaped -lrb- which is what is so appealing about it - the sleek profile -rrb- , there is too much stress on the zippers at the corners unfortunately , the designers did n't take this into account and now the bag is useless since i ca n't keep it closed have noticed that i am not the only one this has happened to - wonder what the manufacturer is going to do about it
i really like this bag i can put my macbook , ipad and the cords in wonderfully and have some room left for pens not much other room , though so if you are looking for a bag to hold other things than your macbook , it may not be the bag for you the handle is wide and strong i would compare it to a seatbelt overall , i like this bag
bought this for my wife 's macbook my wife wanted something different and stylish . she hates the regular laptop bags in the market . this one is very nice with vibrant interior green color high quality material . she just loves it
i researched a lot of bags for my # inch macbook pro , and this one fits like a glove i thought the green would be more annoying than it really is i also like the bulge in the bottom , allowing for my mouse and my camera without pressing them into my computer if you want a bag for carrying a ton of books with your computer , this probably wo n't work for you but if you 're looking for a smaller , lightweight , well-made bag to carry the essentials , this is definitely worth the money
works very nicely two things that would make it better a better pocket for memory cards a little larger at the top because i have a battery grip on my dslr
i really like this bag , and all of my camera gear -lrb- sony a # + # lenses -rrb- fit nicely with a small laptop however , i have this one strange issue , where when wearing my <unk> shirts , -lrb- like the silver ridge travel shirt -rrb- it snags the shirt something to do with the material of the strap and body of the bag and the shirt do n't know if anyone else has had this problem but i ended up <unk> a couple of shirts before i caught on to what was happening anyway , regardless of that , the bag is great , durable and stood up to two weeks in europe i love the removable insert for the photo equipment i believe it is a great product , just do n't combine it with <unk> shirts
bought this so i could keep my <unk> x # s with me and protected at all times bag is very well constructed and thought out quick access to camera is brilliant
i had seen this bag in <unk> magazine and wanted to get one so i waited <unk> the chocolate bag was in , i am so glad i purchased it you have no idea how many camera bags i go through just to get the right one this is it , for now , anyway
i have lots of photography bags this one does n't look like a photo bag which is what i was looking for lots of room for my photo equipment and my laptop it also has lots of little pockets for things like cell phone , filters , point and shoot camera i also really like the quick access to camera from the top without having to open the whole bag
the bag is nice but the zipper busted out shortly after purchasing amazon says to contact hp about the warranty have been transferred over # times over a two hour period with hp to speak to someone about the warranty apparently no one there knows anything i will be purchasing another bag , not hp and not from amazon
i own the previous version of this hp case and love it the only draw back to the old version was the limited laptop space , so i had to stick with my # inch screen for years i recently had to replace my laptop to a larger screen and was hoping that this case would be a close match to the previous version , but with a larger laptop storage area the problem with this new case is that there 's plenty of space for flat items , versus hardware , and being a mobile computer support technician that was a large issue for me so storing my <unk> # , my laptop , and all the cables and adapters was nowhere near as organized as the previous case so now i have plenty of room for papers and cd 's but had to get far too creative for my ac adapters hp needed to include much deeper pockets in the <unk> area
this item met my intended use i would most definitely recommend this case to anyone who has hp # all-in-one printer only one slight issue that case can only carry a # inch laptop whereas some my have a lager than # inch laptop . but this case can support a lager laptop fits very tight my overall impression of this case is that it is an excellent and i will most definitely recommend it to anyone who is in need of this type of case great portable office essential component
it is very well constructed and designed on the `` negative side `` , i do n't see how one could fit a laptop in the bag with the printer ; even if you carry only # a <unk> of paper -lrb- # of duty cycle -rrb- but , i did n't buy it for that purpose i have an excellent bag for my laptop this means i can carry # <unk> of paper and a few pages of a couple different sizes of photo paper i will be using it for a lot of vacation traveling if i am not sure of the <unk> of ink , there is room for a <unk> set of ink <unk> i would be totally ecstatic if i could print to this printer -lrb- using blue tooth -rrb- from our ipad # and iphone # as well sadly , ca n't find a way to do that , yet <unk> did my review help you decide
i have been looking for a laptop case , and tried out the oakley bag for my laptop it had a lot of good features , but did n't have room for my printer this not only has room for my printer , but i can carry my <unk> portable scanner also it has separate removable compartments for the cords , so that i wo n't get them mixed up i work out of several offices , and need my computer , printer and scanner almost everywhere that i go it also has another compartment that has several dividers for files this is going to help me keep more organized i like the slotted dvd pocket , which will keep my dvd 's or cd 's from scratching each other this is perfect for me , my life style , and my job
this bag has made life alot easier to carry everything in one bag since it is in one bag i do n't have to look around for different cords and what not laptop and mobile printer in one it 's great !
this case was exactly what i was looking for i travel a lot and wanted one case for my surface pro , phone , <unk> , writing equipment , portable scanner , and my hp office jet # portable printer i particularly liked the two zippered pouches for power supplies and smaller incidentals before i bought it , i searched in several stores for something that would perform the functions i wanted and found nothing finally , i decided to take a chance and order this one from amazon , thanks to the <unk> amazon return system this bag is big enough to carry more than the items i mentioned you could easily carry a laptop instead of a tablet of course the weight increases with everything you add to it , which to me , is a problem the first time i used it , i put so much in it that i got neck <unk> when i carried it on my shoulder . that is not the fault of the bag but more the fault of my bad packing ; but , it gives you an idea of how much can be packed into the bag
so far very happy to have purchased this carrying case ! ! ! ! ! your going to need it if you have purchased the hp office <unk> printer it will protect your printer and it is very roomy and you can put all of your cables , computer junk and paper stock too in this bag
it does n't hurt that i happen to love my bluetooth printer to start with it 's small and compact and just a printer the case holds both my sony laptop , the printer , paperwork , a portable surge protector and all the rest of the necessary cords , etc . that go along with it mind you , it will be quite wide and bulky compared to a regular computer case , but if you are looking for a combo , this is a great choice
so after carrying this bag stuffed with my hp # printer and my # . # & # # ; lap top , and about # & # # ; worth of files & paper , the zipper broke this has been the best computer bag i 've ever owned i work in the construction industry and probably abuse this bag more than i should it has protected my printer & lap top for # . # years and now i 'm back to buy another hp carry bag i realize this review is long over due but i have been so pleased with this product , i have to put in my # cents on this bag if you have or are planning on buying a hp portable printer & # . # & # # ; lap top or you are looking for a bag to carry those items look no further , this is it
i love , love , love it it is finally a bag that will protect my portable hp # , computer and cords it has tons of room , but with that being said ... . . it also weighs a ton i plan on buying a travel cart that people use to pull luggage that collapses i think it will be worth it because my printer was getting beat up in all of the other bags i was trying to use
this messanger / laptop bag is very roomy it fits a mac notebook , several school books , accesories and you still have more space the material is resistant but cute i recommend it fo your <unk> for school or even adults
this bag is bigger than you would expect , but i got used to its size pretty quickly it has plenty of room for a laptop and several text books , and enough extra pockets for cords and such it 's very durable and looks great it would be nice if one of the side pockets was capable of holding a water bottle , but it 's too shallow
what can i say high quality material that just looks awesome strap is strong and connected to the bag so you never have to worry about it breaking i put my laptop , several book , all my accessories , games , water <unk> it holds a ton , holds up strong , and looks <unk> . # % satisified
this bag is awesome it 's nice and sturdy and large enough for my # `` powerbook the laptop compartment is well padded and there is plenty room for storing books , papers , disk , or just about anything you may need to include and then some i get a lot of compliments on the bag itself and my favorite feature is the durability
i loved this item it was very inexpensive and my laptop fits inside perfectly there is also plenty of pockets for my other stuff it even has a perfect side pocket for my cell phone
this bag turned out to be much bigger than i expected it says `` # . # inches `` and i thought that this was it 's width , but no , this is it 's height ; it 's width is approx . # inches i also expected the color of the bag to be a bit stronger , but the bag altogether looks faded ; it 's still looks cool and stylish but i just did not expect this the bag is of good quality and seems as though it will last for at least a few years ; however , the black strap has quite a few frayed bits of cotton <unk> pieces sticking out they 're hardly noticable but i feel like they 're worth mentioning other than that , the color is cool and overall i 'm happy with my purchase i 've gotten quite a few compliments
this case is really well made , no problems after # months of use it has a lot of space , i really mean that , it is actually a little bit bigger than i thought it 's capable of holding a # `` laptop -lrb- i was looking for something a little bit smaller -rrb- very well padded inside bag i would like some more accesories bags , but it 's good enough , and as other reviews ... the belt is no good , i always keep it off
i bought this bag for my girlfriend 's laptop and she loves it the only complaint i would have is the odd way of latching it closed -lrb- you take a strap and push it through a metal bracket -rrb- but other than that it is great bag at a good price
this bag is too big for the smaller size laptops this bag works great for carrying several books or folders -lrb- which i used the most -rrb- greatly recommend this item for its durability
the bag is somewhat bigger than i thought it 's nice looking and looks like good quality laptop fits perfect , is great for carrying books too it looks great with this extraordinary buckle but i am a little worried about wear and tear of it one thing that bugs me a little is that it does n't have a handle all in all though , well worth the money
this bag is perfect for my laptop and every day stuff the strap is a bit annoying to get `` <unk> `` so i do n't usually latch it the velcro keeps it shut lots of pockets and storage
this is most definitely the best bag i 've ever used of it 's kind it 's made of sturdy materials which are very well put together i only have two complaints # -rrb- the metal clasp is hard to use - the leather strap does n't quite fit into it as easily as i 'd like it to , but i 'd imagine i 'll get used to it eventually # -rrb- the strap does not have swivel points to work out kinks after you put the strap over your shoulder this is a very minor complaint - just make sure you have the kinks worked out before you put it on . :
as a med student i carry a computer and # to # books at a time before getting the caselogic messenger bag i had to carry my computer in one bag and books in another now i can carry everything in one its also very comfortable i recommended it to anybody with an apple # inch laptop and a ton of stuff to carry
the bag looks and feels great it has plenty of room for my laptop and my books and i look forward to using it for a long time the other reviewers were correct , however , on the clasp difficulty that would be the only <unk> ; it 's just a bit inconvenient to clasp the bag other than that , a great bag and a fantastic value
i would not even understand how this could be given a bad review it is a beautiful bag and the perfect size for a college student it closes like it should and the strap is a great length
i really like the bag it 's bigger than i realized from the dimensions and pictures but in a good way i 'm happy to not look like everyone else with plain black laptop bags
this bag outlasted the computer it was purchased for and was very functional and durable for two years replacement computer smaller so of course necessitated a new case please note it was a dead hard drive that <unk> computer so this bag plenty protective
i wanted a good looking , practical laptop case for business and this one is a beauty i am in the field more than the office , so solid protection was a factor in deciding which case to buy a messenger style bag can be awkward to deal with when i am in front of a client and need some small article from the case this baby has plenty of organizational pockets that make it a breeze to retrieve items it has rubber feet on the bottom to protect the fabric when you set it on the floor , and a comfy carry handle that should endure and not look <unk> down the road i am glad i spent a few more bucks and got a case i was proud to bring into a clients facility
this case is perfect for a smaller notebook computer i have a thinkpad x # and it fits along with my papers and a few accessories the padding nicely protects the computer and the case is well made if you have a larger computer or need to carry more stuff you might want to look at a different case
this laptop bag is well made and looks professional i was pleasantly surprised by the quality and really expected less for the price i paid ... great value and speedy shipping ... what more can you ask for
i really do like this bag there 's enough padding for my dell , and it just looks pretty cool the only thing -lrb- and it 's a minor thing -rrb- that i wish it had was more pockets i 'm a pretty big fan of pockets , tho , so i just might be partial it is a good bag , tho
