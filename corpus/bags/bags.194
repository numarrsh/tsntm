i first saw this backpack in a computer box store -lrb- <unk> with rest cry -rrb- for $ # . # i fell in love with the ultra smooth zipper and very high quality material but felt the price was too high for a backpack i bought mine for about $ # and it 's well worth it it is very comfortable and the <unk> is cushioned nicely i use mine for work in nyc & it looks like new after almost # months of bus / subway commuting wear & tear multiple padded pockets & storage for laptop , book / magazines , glasses case , keys , water etc . i truly can not find anything negative about this product
i was looking to upgrade my computer backpack and wanted something professional and functional after looking at a lot of bags this one fit the bill without being too expensive i like the sturdy feel , and yet it is lightweight using on my first trip and so far so good only sight dislike is that the front organizer pocket does n't zip open as wide as i would like makes getting items in and out of that pocket a little tight
it fits everything i need but it could be a little bigger it will protect your laptop well but for any laptop bigger than a # . # & # # ; screen it would be a very snug fit the front pocket is kind of weird and very small it wo n't fit much if you put something in the tablet pocket i 'd recommend this if you do n't carry textbooks with you
great laptop backpack , fits perfectly and has tons of space for all the wires , papers , and other gadgets the strap on the back is great for hooking it into a <unk> for ease of travel
very well constructed with an adjustable space for either my laptop or my netbook also has a useful internal divider for my papers as well as slots for my phone and tablet -lrb- though i would never take so many electronic devices appears to be very well made and looks more professional -lrb- if a backpack could look professional -rrb- than the typical backpack used the <unk> computer feature through security twice and had no problems there
i was extremly hesitant as i like to see the pockets and fit before i buy a new bag but it was a good price and i figured i could return it if it did n't work out nice big pockets but the appearance from the outside looks <unk> the customize your laptop pocket is a nice touch as i have an extended battery for my laptop so it sticks out a little further the straps are very comfortable and it has handles in all the right spots i am extremely pleased with this bag so far i 'll update once i 've had it a little longer
this is a perfect backpack i was <unk> surprised with how adjustable and intuitive the design of this backpack is the side pockets do n't let stuff fall out of them i keep my keys in them the padding is great and this fits my # . # & # # ; dell studio perfectly i love the document pouches because they keep the bottom of my books from getting too banged up to sell back at the end of the semester
i saw this in the mall for # dollars , i found it here on amazon for less and accidentally ordered it shipping was great , no issues and i just love that it looks and feels like a high quality product my laptop fits perfectly , i have a # & # # ; laptop i do n't recommend this backpack if you have a bigger laptop -lrb- if that 's your primary purpose for getting it -rrb- no regrets on my accidental order
just received shipment on this pack construction seems very sound it will get field tested soon , if problems show up a second review will be submitted , but for now , design and <unk> are very good
i absolutely love this backpack i have had it for nearly a year now , and the only sign of wear has been the metal samsonite logo pin on the front coming off -lrb- which was only recently -rrb- the padding on the back is the best i have ever seen and protects laptops with superior design the pitch black color looks just plain sexy and the <unk> nylon texture is tough and professional like an armored beast -lrb- you can tell i 'm excited ? -rrb- the straps are very adjustable and also very well padded the handle is very durable and comfortable -- not to mention functional as it helps tremendously with a heavy load the pockets are all very nice -lrb- as the pictures imply -rrb- and the available space is awesome i have never used the strap for suitcases or luggage carrying but i 'm sure it works fine -lrb- i mean it literally just holds the bag onto a suitcase handle ... -rrb- so this bag is in my opinion the very best backpack out there , and for its price you can find no other match just buy it already
great feel on my back ... weight is distributed perfectly for long hauls no issues squeezing in a laptop , tablet , cables , paper folders , a couple eyeglasses cases , etc . the water bottle holders on the left and right side and <unk> capable of holding large bottles snugly -lrb- thought the fabric would have less give based on the photos -rrb- the top mini pocket is especially handy for quick access to my cell phone on an airplane while the bag is stowed under the seat in front of me as other reviewers have mentioned , the only thing missing is a keychain holder sewn into the bag
we bought for gifting a relative and made & # # ; & # # ; the selection of this model thinking of electronics that it needs to carry we think that was a good choice we recommend the seller
one trial run where it was a perfect fit have to get used to all the pockets for easier location of items while traveling , but on one international trip it fulfilled all my wishes would n't change a thing
i bought this for travel it is well made and looks classy the only complaint i have is about the front top outer pocket which has a soft lining that protrudes into the bottom pocket . overall this is a great buy and excellent
great quality , very great workmanship i bought this backpack mainly for my dell tablet it has many pockets and compartments , enough for # tablets i would highly recommend buy this if your looking for a backpack to carry your <unk>
i love this backpack so much it looks really sharp , and it gives your plenty of room to organize your stuff in your bag sometimes i put some my baby stuffs in here too , and it works great as baby diaper bag <unk> recommend for students
this backpack is very impressive on all levels - style , quality , durability , space and price the laptop compartment comfortably accommodates my # `` macbook pro it 's velcro adjustable in length and width , and very well-padded this product exceeded my already high expectations i doubt you 'll find a better backpack for this very <unk> price
my daughter travels with carry on all of the time this back pack is great for just that it allows her to bring her books computer and personal clothing and she still has
this is perfect for airports there are large compartments too fit everything you need i carry laptop -lrb- # & # # ; -rrb- , google nexus tablet , all my wires , mouse , two phones , extra chargers , a change of clothes and jacket all within this backpack very comfortable and very sleek
i use this as my daily work backpack and absolutely love it the material is very strong and has withstood several trips through airport security , overhead baggage storage and being thrown in the trunk of a car with multiple pieces of luggage i use every aspect of this backpack 's storage and so far do n't have any complaints
bought two of these for global travel they have pockets galore , are made of strong ballistic nylon with strategic padding , strong zippers and a fair price happy i bought two of them
best feature is that it slips over the handle of rolling luggage so you do n't have to carry it while walking form one end on airport to the other plenty of room and easy access makes it a good choice
this bag exceeds all of my expectations . it has plenty of pockets and is lightweight but sturdy i love it because i can put my keys , credit cards and much more in it so i do n't have to carry a purse i simply love it for travel too both my ipad and laptop fit in the backpack with lots of room for my paperwork
a simple word says it all a perfect laptop backpack with lot of compartments with an awesome organizer with it a must go laptop bag with great linings too happy to having such a wonderful piece
the adjustable laptop compartment is wonderful , and so is the tablet pocket took it on a long trip and it stowed all the electronic gear for a family of four perfectly highly recommend it
a + quality takes a beating is very & # # ; mature & # # ; and & # # ; sophisticated & # # ; -lrb- not like a walmart middle school backpack -rrb- yet functional and sturdy laptop fits perfectly -lrb- # inch -rrb- and has padding for comfort on back
it is a classic backpack that can fit anything for the business professional on the go and still provide the chic and stylist look for those of us who are familiar with samsonite products good investment for the price
i am going to be using this on my next trip it is small enough to be my & # # ; personal & # # ; bag and will go under the seat in the plane it is big enough to carry my essentials for my trip great bag , nice construction and i will probably use this a lot after my trip too
this backup was perfect , i have a # inch computer and most other backpacks are too small this is very large and i can hold everything i need to bring with me traveling to work in a different office including my supplies .
the bag is excellent , perfect size , very high quality , lots <unk> pockets and internal space for your laptop , tablet , earphones and lots of other stuff the strap on the back for putting on a suitcase handle is brilliant and very important - the zippers are amazing they run smoothly and quickly the entire bag shows like a very very good <unk> recommended
i have been using this for almost a year , and it has <unk> up over # miles across the u.s. and <unk> . . it has n't ripped deformed , faded or stretched and still looks new everything fits perfectly as described , highly recommend
i use this to haul my # & # # ; macbook to and from work and grad school every day i previously used a messenger bag for this purpose , but after a day of carrying , my shoulder would ache this bag has plenty of pockets for a variety of accessories -lrb- phone charger , notes and notebooks , headphones , calculator , etc . -rrb- in addition to the laptop the rear pocket has a cushioned area for the laptop , with a velcro strap to snugly keep a computer in place i roughly estimate that a <unk> # & # # ; would probably move around too much in the pocket , and a <unk> # & # # ; laptop would have trouble fitting into the sleeve there are also a couple of elastic <unk> pockets on the sides , great for a water or soda bottle one minor annoyance : the interior lining of the smaller pockets is a velvety material that is a little annoying to the touch this is a matter of opinion and barely worth mentioning very satisfied overall
this backpack is not too big on the outside but it expands on the inside providing lots of pockets and space also great for traveling and very comfortable fits # . # toshiba very well good deal for the money
ca n't beat $ # for a backpack like this the zippers all slide very nicely and it has a pocket for everything that you 've got the laptop pocket 's straps adjust to fit my laptop perfectly , as expected the pocket has a nice amount of padding it feels very nice on the back and looks great too it comes with a # -year warranty but expect it to last a lot longer , <unk> just by how durable the materials feel
back when i ordered this product , a samsonite backpack with a promotional and yet reasonable prices so i decided to order and i was fully satisfied when i received the package very practical backpack i recommend it to <unk> is looking for a small travel backpack
my son beats up his backpacks and usually needs a new one at the start of a school year and again half way through the year the reviews on this pack typically said it was very sturdy and i had hopes that it would be it really is - you can tell from the stitching and just the feel of it that it 's going to last it 's very roomy and the straps are comfortable , even with the ton of books and other things he carries around in it while he sometimes has my laptop this bag is n't normally used for them he does have an ipad though and the area for it is very protective there are enough pockets to cover everything you need and not so many that half of them will go unused like some of the other utility packs are i recommend this bag , the price is very reasonable for the high quality you receive update # / # : this backpack had light use during the summer but it is still in perfect shape -lrb- not even a frayed thread -rrb- and is in full blown use again for this school year again , my son really goes through backpacks usually and this one is standing up like nothing he 's had before
it is a great backpack at the price i bought it for my boyfriend and he loves it the quality is very good the only <unk> is the backpack is not big enough to fit a # inches laptop i would like to recommend the backpack to my friends it is great at the price
i moved up to real world by eliminating the standard issue pc bag and <unk> this backpack is organized to manage my # years of carrying a bag that is so simple and convenient here is my advice , get rid of that pc bag and get this xenon backpack if not this one ... . . find one ... but will not find the quality , design , professional design , ease of carry and price . i shopped and shopped save a back ache and time buy this from amazon because you will save about $ # as compared to ... .
it is really a great choice very good quality and material . looks good . has a place for everything -lrb- laptop , tablet , books -rrb- i liked the laptop area it is really size conservative
this is a really nice backpack looks nicer than a school backpack -lrb- that was my fear using it as a work laptop case -rrb- seems sturdy and has many pockets fits my large # & # # ; dell nicely and many other work related peripherals definitely worth the small price tag
i love this computer bag it is lightweight and very roomy the best part is the separate zippered compartment for your laptop making it easy to go through security without removing your laptop price is great too
finally i received this backpack and i can retire my previous <unk> slim one very good internal <unk> , suitable for my # & # # ; mba seated steady in the last layer middle layer has a large space , as you can see from the picture , enough to put # days ' travelling stuff front pocket has fleece so you can put your phone in it free of scratching
after years of using a jansport backpack -lrb- which cost more the xenon # one right now -rrb- , i decided to try samsonite i spent quite a bit of time researching backpacks since i carry one everyday and carries thousands of dollars of electronics i considered some very expensive options , but found that the xenon # offered a high quality build and well thought our design at a very low price the fabric is rugged and much stronger than the fabric of my jansport the straps are comfortable and even fits my large frame with ease my macbook pro # . # -lrb- retina display -rrb- fits very snugly in the adjustable laptop compartment tablets that are # inches fit in a elastic compartment inside and # inch tables fit well in the two compartments in the middle additional batteries , cords , usb flash drives , and pens all have their place - no need to rummage through a `` miscellaneous `` section for that slippery flash drive i really like the fact that this backpack sits upright on the floor ; i keep it right next to my desk at work and at home so that i can easily and quickly access items inside samsonite , you make a mean backpack
very good quality , a lot of pockets for yours stuff and the most important something called & # # ; perfect fit & # # ; to fit your notebook exactly it needs and of course bagpack is tsa friendly , it means that you do n't have to pull out your notebook for bagpack while check in on the airport highly recommended for traveller
purchased this backpack to replace a worn out backpack that i thought would be <unk> i have come to realize that this backpack is far more superior to any other backpack i have owned anyone who is looking for a backpack to carry their laptop plus a ton of other items , this is the bag for you not to mention that the quality is very good i expect this bag to <unk> and outlast my old bag <unk>
i was skeptical about anyone trying to sell a laptop backback for $ # retail i looked at some $ # bags at a major retailer and decided i liked the samsonite 's style better i just got it delivery on friday , and while i have n't taken a trip with it yet , i am impressed with the attention to detail and build quality felt lining on many pockets , sturdy zippers , a good handle , comfortable straps for the few minutes i wore it around the house - all in all a very well done design and initial quality i 'll update after i take it on the road
i travel quite a bit and was getting tired of my rolling computer bag especially with a <unk> winter <unk> perfect for back and forth to work and going through the airport
i really enjoy this bag because the idea and style are very nice i prefer so many pockets and they are fit for laptop , cell phone and other stuff . i think it is worth of value although the price is not cheap
in the first when i opened the <unk> it was a little <unk> however the bag is <unk> and <unk> and soft on your back that 's why i love
i 've used this backpack for about # months now if you 're a traveler , you 'll like this backpack ample room for all your junk , good protection , and if you do n't get your tsa precheck , it zips open to lay flat on the belt so you do n't have to take your pc out
this meets the expectations others shared on this backpack it is tsa friendly there are so many pockets for everything you need including a variety of snacks with room for sack lunch i would not put my wallet with id , etc in the pack if carried on my back for security reasons i <unk> that on my person the strap on the back did indeed slide over my luggage carrier 's handle some posts said it did not perhaps that is dependent on the size luggage you are wheeling around
i love this backpack it is tsa friendly , safely secures my laptop and holds a lot of other stuff this is my second one as my first one was stolen i made sure to quickly replace it
i have been using this bag for past month initially i used this bag as a school bag and later as a travel bag during holidays it has got lot of space and pockets to accommodate all the things required for school and for travel purposes i really liked the laptop pocket which is flexible and can accommodate any laptop of variety of sizes the stitch quality is really good and looks are also decent overall thumbs up
this is a perfect laptop bag with lots of small compartments to keep everything you need including a pocket for a tablet the material looks good and feels long lasting the laptop fits snugly and size can be adjusted to fit your laptop overall , an excellent buy
lots of room for books , notebook , loose papers , chargers , tablets , magazines , bottled water , etc . the pockets are excellent and offer very good storage for today 's gadgets and accessories the laptop compartment is nice that it is tsa compliant and opens up nicely and fits my macbook pro # & # # ; perfectly the bag is n't super large but will fit a lot of what you need to carry on a day to day basis quality made product that i will use constantly
i am more than pleased with this pc backpack holds my laptop , ipad , and much more well padded throughout the luggage strap holds snugly on to my spinner luggage
it has a lot of pockets and ajustable pocket for laptop quality is also very good it perfectly fits for my lenovo t # i recommend it to anyone who is looking for business backpack
for the price , this bag is amazing very good quality , lots of pockets it has the perfect size for different uses - going to work everyday - occasional # days business trips - as a & # # ; <unk> & # # ; bag -lrb- for photo camera , bottle of water ... there are <unk> expensive bags , but for the price i doubt you can find something so good
i have been looking for the perfect <unk> backpack for awhile this is perfect ! it is well made with just the right compartments it made going through tsa much easier because i did n't have to take my laptop out just unzip and lay it flat i am going to buy another one for my boyfriend -lrb- he was jealous .
i purchased this for a business trip to asia i took this and a carryon size suitcase -lrb- checked for the most part -rrb- as my sole luggage for a two week trip this backpack was responsible for all the critical stuff : laptop , tablet , e-reader , phone , all power cords and adapters , pens and binder , cards , glasses , snacks and a light jacket as well as any pocket stuff like cash , wallet , passport when necessary it handled it no problem and slid under the seat easily on big and small aircraft after coming home , it has replaced my typical daily and travel briefcase and it is holding up very well it is comfortable to wear , it slides securely onto wheeled luggage , and has a nice mix of pockets without going <unk> the water bottle sleeves on the outside are very useful . highly recommended
i bought this bag for my new laptop and it is has been a great product to use so far the bag is made of high quality materials and my # . # `` laptops fits perfectly there lots of different pockets and many of the pockets use soft fabric to protect your belongings from damage the laptop pouch within the bag is all made of soft materials and will keep the laptop snug and well protected the bag is also tsa friendly for carrying through airport check points which is a big plus finally the secondary compartment in the bag can also accommodate additional electronics such another laptop , tablet etc .
the first time that i used the zipper on the front it did n't work i pulled to close it and the part in my hand just continued to go i stopped it there was nothing to catch it
when i bought a $ # bag i did n't expect a very high quality bag i expected a cheap bag made of cheap materials , which is what i got the materials feel cheap , but the stitching actually seems pretty good it can hold my laptop , tablet and enough workpapers to bring home with me at the end of a work day , but it wont hold much else i did n't get this bag to be an everyday bag , i got it as a back up to leave at my desk to use on a rare occasion that i a different bag for this purpose its great i would not use it on a daily basis though because it feels like it would n't last me long
really only fits a # & # # ; laptop . product feels a bit thin <unk> , if you 're just looking for something to carry your laptop and # notebooks you 're should be set if you 're looking for it to protect your laptop from breaking , look elsewhere
no nonsense , no frills bag inner laptop compartment is a little thin , but overall it is a good buy specially if you keep your laptop in an external sleeve
i am not a fan of messenger bags , but this one is making me a believer lightweight and functional organization i needed a quick and easy place to carry my tablet , and sometimes more this fits the bill
very nice and high quality for the price my thinkpad fits perfectly in the cushioned pocket , with plenty of room for anything else i want to throw in i would highly recommend this item
the case does n't fit it is very close , but three friends and i could n't even get it on so the top is just slid on , and the bottom is n't on at all
i ended up having to return this product as soon as i recieved it since it was too small for my computer make sure you check the model correctly i have a pavillion but i guess the series is different
i ordered this cover because i needed something to hide the sticker residue on my laptop i was expecting the case to be opaque ; instead i was surprised to see it was # % transparent all it did was tint the sticker residue on my laptop light blue definitely not what i was expecting
i was not what i want it is to small for my laptop i thought if you order the size of the cream that it would fit the laptop but i guess that i was wrong so i am suppose to be sending it back , in process just want the refund back
pros : it has a beautiful color of <unk> cons : it does not fit for the life of me it is the right size , but all of the holes in the case do not <unk> to the switches and ports and things in my laptop it 's a shame but oh well thank you for having returns , at least ;
love the color and that it protects my computer however i could n't fit the bottom at all i tried and tried for days and just could n't idk why cuz it 's the length that the description says also is hp laptop for that part i 'm disappointed
i absolutely love my laptop skin ! it fits perfect and matches my personality # % i would order more from this company ipearl -lrb- : it definitely fits me and my lifestyle & well at the same time im addicted to cases ... for well anything electronic wise -lrb- : ! highly recommended
i was looking everywhere for some type of case that would fit my new hp pavilion dv # c # dx , purchased february # i started with a company that said they make `` custom skins for every type of laptop `` , except after spending $ # on one of their skins , it arrived and did n't fit at all i was really bummed and kept looking until i came across this item i was wary until it arrived and it truly is a great case it fits my laptop like a glove , looks very cool -lrb- i purchased the aqua color -rrb- and even protects the bottom plus , i love the little plastic feet that pop out if you want them , they are great i would absolutely recommend this case
this product is exactly what i needed for my computer at first i had some difficulty with shipping , but amazon is so helpful they helped me out every step of the way thank you amazon for an affordable and cool case
it was just as advertised ... it 's just i should have measured my laptop before ordering it is a little large for my laptop , but that 's my fault the product itself is good quality and exactly what i expected . :
the sleeve fits my # . # inch laptop well it is well padded for protection and has a velcro infront to hold the flap cover in place it has nice vibrant colors that makes it stand out and very pleasing to the eye
for the price - very good product color is nice , i like the style a lot however , i think it 's a little too snug on my computer i find that there are imprints of my keyboard on my screen when i open up my laptop after sitting in my case for a while for reference , i have a # . # -inch macbook pro
i purchased the # & # # ; sleeve for my # . # & # # ; macbook air and love it it fits snuggly but the material is flexible so the computer is easy to get in and out the opening for the powercord is convenient i really like the protection that the sleeve offers when i am out and about , i also have toddlers in the house and feel confident that my laptop is protected the velcro is heavy duty which i also like i would buy it again
really was surprised when i opened the box this sleeve is very pretty and is well made my hp laptop fits nicely inside and i feel safe that it is protected has slot on side so you can use your charger if necessary
love my new sony duo # tablet/laptop combo but was not crazy about the only case available for it so i thought i 'd give this one a chance it fits great and will offer some protection when i want to carry my computer around the house though i have a sturdier case for travel
i have a toshiba satellite # . # inch l # and this sleeve fits <unk> with no <unk> but easily allows for my laptop to slide in and out with ease i did n't want to have to deal with a zipper and this was perfect option for me the velcro closure on the flap holds it closed exceptionally well the back side is covered by a large outer pocket that also has two velcro closures since the material has some stretch it should be easy enough to put the power cord in there , although it will make a rather large lump <unk> , the sleeve seems to be well made and i am happy with it
i bought this sleeve because being a student , i needed something that was durable and looked good to transport my laptop back and forth from home to school this sleeve fits like a glove and keeps it protected
lost my keys through the zipper pouch the first day i used it as there is about a two inch length of seam that didnt connect when it was stitched poor quality control , i looked the bag over when i got it but the seam has stitches so i didnt notice - stitches are not actually sewn into anything though very disappointing , yes it holds my tablet well but not much else !
i have an # & # # ; macbook air the bag fit the computer well , but not much else the bag was too small to fit the # & # # ; x # & # # ; plastic folders i use to carry papers around so it was n't useful to me
this is a great bag for someone that is between minimalist and wanting to carry a lot you can have both the ipad and macbook pro in the bag with a few other things like a phone the vertical storage is nice the only improvement i could recommend is the strap could use a little more rubber on padding to prevent the strap from slipping off shoulder
i read the reviews and thought , how small could it be ? really ? - well no exaggeration there - this is a small bag i carry a dell xps # ultra light convertible tablet/laptop and its power adapter -lrb- very tiny mini brick -rrb- barely fits with the laptop add in a mifi hotspot and a small personal daily <unk> and this thing is stuffed to the gills very sleek , very well made - but this is more of a grab and go bag , versus a daily bag if all you need is your laptop then go for it , if not size up
i really like the bag it is made of a very sturdy material and is comfortable to carry i would like one compartment to hold an average sized book and although it has several compartments once the inside of the bag is full those outside compartments are really almost useless
i 've had my bag for about a month and have been pleased with it i have a macbook pro # & # # ; this bag fits snugly which is ok but i ca n't really use the back pocket and the cell phone case was missing when i received it
i really liked this bag and i would have given it # stars if i would have kept it i was looking for something more feminine but this had the perfect protection for a laptop and great compartments
after hours of searching for a decent # inch laptop bag , i finally decided on this one the bag is well made and has a lot of compartments for storage my only complaint is that the shoulder strap is n't very long ; this bag is for my # ' tall boyfriend and i 'm afraid it might not hang long enough for him i am # ' # & # # ; and stretched all the way out , it hangs about at my hip which is fine for me , but a taller person may want something a bit longer other than that , i think it was a great buy
i bought this bag for a # ' & # # ; macbook pro and love it it 's compact , but there is still plenty of room for accessories , flies and other devices and even a book it seems especially roomy when compared with the stm jacket sleeve that i had tried earlier i like its vertical orientation , its top handle , its sections and compartments , and rugged construction and appealing design
this houses my personal # & # # ; macbook air like a glove it seems made for my notebook -lrb- prolly is -rrb- i have no problems taking my notebook from cafe to cafe ... enjoy
the bag just arrived and i think it is perfect it seems to protect my notebook -lrb- # `` -rrb- , looks great , great size a notebook , wallet , keys and book could fit so far it seems very sturdy i would recommend it
my dell xps # laptop and ipad fit nicely in this <unk> adequate case . room for chargers and a few other things too comes in a grayish color - would have prefered black - but it 's fine nice carry handle or shoulder strap
this is an awesome bag i use my macbook air for school primarily and decided to get this bag because the one i had was too big for my new macbook air and was n't too protected this thing holds your laptop like a baby it 's really comfortable to wear the only thing i can complain about is the velcro can be noisy when you get to class late and have to open your bag to get your laptop out , but that 's not really a problem it 's an awesome bag and i 'm really pleased i got it after looking at so many alternatives i believe this is the absolute best for a # -inch ultra-book
it 's spacious , classy , well made and reasonably priced i carry my mba # and all the usual accessories in it and there is still plenty of room left for other
i have been looking for a bag like this forever it fits my macbook perfectly , and it fits my ipad in another pocket i like to travel with all my cables - about # cables they all have a place the front pocket fits all the quickie items , and it makes travel a breeze the construction is durable it 's really exactly as advertised
good for a small lap top , ipad , light inspection tools , a note pad . spare smart phone , digital camera , chargers , and lots of pens it hangs to the body for easy mobility in and around parts of buildings , parks , while climbing to prime <unk> points for photo <unk> i might have to get another only slightly smaller
