if you are looking for a rolling bag for your laptop that is light and well made , this is for you it maneuvers like a dream on wheels that seem to make it float
i bought this bag to <unk> my shoulder due to an injury and am really glad i did this is the best value quality bag the design is clean and streamlined ; great material i especially love the elegant shoulder strap hardware that 's hidden and effective in keeping the strap aligned i 've been recommending the bag to everyone at work
- tons of room for carrying extra <unk> strap/handle combo gives good <unk> quality construction than i 've found in other messenger bag style laptop <unk> enough to not even look like a laptop <unk> bad - fold over flap is the only top closure and does n't even cover the width of the notebook compartment , leaving electronics and other items in the bag little protection from the
i do like this bag , it looks nice , has plenty of padding to keep your computer safe and has nice sections for pens , drink etc . loads of room for all your stuff and the actual computer compartment seems big enough to fit the largest of laptops but the problem is that it 's a bit heavy i have never used a laptop bag so maybe they 're all like this but the empty bag is certainly not lightweight and when you do fill it up it weighs a ton the product description said it has been designed with some enhanced comfort feature but i ca n't see how this could ever make much difference as you still have all the weight on one shoulder anyway , it 's perfect if you want to look cool getting out of your car but if you want to walk further than a couple of minutes with it i would suggest looking for something lighter
like the style , color and size holds my # in hp perfectly also has enough space for a few books and battery i would definitely recommend it to someone have n't used it long to know how durable it is however for the price i wo n't mind getting # years out of it
i bought this backpack for my son he 's in middle school this year and needed a bigger backpack the backpack is very cool-looking it has lots of various little pockets , which is an asset because they can hold small items that would get lost in the bigger compartments the shoulder staps are comfortable and it has a strap around the waist as well due to the quality of the backpack , i think my son is going to be using this backpack for a <unk> time he 'll already have something to carry a laptop in when he gets one , which is in the near future
i tried several laptop cases and none would fit my new # `` acer aspire # i knew alienware laptops were thick and wide so , i had a hunch that this backpack would be able to fit my new baby and i was right this backpack has lots of extra space for all my portable stuff , cell phone , chargers , nintendo ds and wireless mouse i still have n't used half of the storage , yet i rate this backpack aaa
this is a nice case for your laptop , and only your laptop you ca n't fit anything else in it it would make sense to at least fit the power cord i never use it and had to get another case to suit my needs
it fits the # . # `` macbook pro snugly the pocket on the back is a little small but it is possible to fit some of the laptop accessories in it the power adapter `` attachment `` for the bag is ridiculously overpriced
i ordered this bag with my new # `` powerbook , the one with aluminum unibody enclosure it seems that this newer version of powerbook is slightly larger and it wo n't fit in this case you can make it work but not without a struggle this is perfect for the previous generation of <unk> but i would n't recommend it for the current model
i purchased the brenthaven edge ii a little over two months ago as promised , the case provides excellent protection for my laptop and is small enough to fit inside another bag the only negative -lrb- although for me it is a big one -rrb- is that you can not fit the power cord in the sleeve i had anticipated using it in conjunction with a second bag , but i had hoped on occasion to be able to use it alone that is n't a realistic option when you ca n't bring a power source
the laptop sits great between the pillows that hold it tight , the corners are hard and can hold bumps but if you want to carry the power cable of your mac or the smallest mouse , neither will fit
this laptop bag will definitely protect your laptop it has reinforced corners and about # inches of padding on either side a really nice case to look at bad points are that you ca n't really fit your powercord , and you ca n't use it as a sleeve unless you have a really large bag
this case is exactly what i was looking for something to keep my macbook pro safe but slim and light so i can use it with the strap or without in any other bag does n't have much extra space , but i did n't need that
i ordered this brenthaven sleeve because the company had a reputation for making high quality products , but i definitely did not expect a `` sleeve `` to have such a solid construction this sleeve totally blew my expectations away there is no flex in the sleeve , and the inside is heavily padded i would not have to worry if i accidentally dropped my laptop from # ft i highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a thin and stylish case without sacrificing laptop protection
brenthaven claims only that the storage sleeve holds papers , but i put my power supply , a headset , and an airport express in there and it works ok it does n't close fully with all that junk in it , so you want to keep an eye on it to make sure nothing slides out not so good for commuting on public <unk> , maybe , but it will get you by in your own car
the sleeve that i received for my macbook pro was exactly as described on the amazon website , so i am very pleased with my purchase and the fact that i received what i wanted
very sleek and stylish built like a tank ... very protected and padded your investment is safe in this one ! ! slim and minimalist ... not much room for anything else a back wide pocket for papers or magazine if you want an organizer or lots of compartments , this is not for you this is a slim , handsome , protective case with not much else . # * for protection
macbook pro . # fits perfect in this bag and it provides solid protection , especially for air travel it is <unk> , but it does n't have room for much anything else -lrb- probably a thin file folder -rrb- macbook pro . is relatively heavier than most of laptops in its category i choose to carry it alone in this bag while carrying files in another bag it works out well for me
this is a great case offers good protection and is easy to access i sent it through the security line at the airport last week -- just zipped it open and laid it flat worked like a charm
i have used samsonite products in the past and have been generally pleased by them , so when i needed a new laptop case , i purchased a samsonite bag honestly , the shoulder strap broke on the first use - it lasted only long enough for me to get out of my office , <unk> one flight of steps , and walk out the door to the parking lot then the shoulder strap gave way , with the stiching hanging only by a string , causing the bag , and a new laptop inside , to bounce off the pavement as if that were not bad enough , the bag has inadequate padding , so my brand new laptop was damaged i contacted samsonite , who told me the warranty covered only the bag and not the contents they also suggested i call the actual manufacturer , who likewise told me that the warranty covers only the bag , and not the contents i 'm somewhat shocked that samsonite cares so little about its brand and reputation
after a couple of months of rather gentle use , the tab where the shoulder strap connects to the portfolio pulled out i never carried a heavy load in it - in fact i had yet to carry my laptop in it i see no way to sew the tab back on or any other way to <unk> the shoulder strap the warranty from amazon.com has expired so i guess i will have to throw it away
when i first got it , i liked it i could fit my # inch macbook pro retina and my ipad -lrb- gen # -rrb- and all the little cables i needed but it 's poor construction quality the straps did n't take long to tear and now are tearing to the point that it 's unusable at the price it is now , it 's probably worth it to get # months out of it , but i paid a lot more when i got it and i 'm pretty frustrated at this point
i got this laptop bag a few weeks ago and have used it daily and taken it on eight flights i have been very satisfied with the product that i got for the price that i paid -lrb- < $ # -rrb- my only complaint is that the description lists , `` rear exterior attache strap fits over most upright luggage handles `` , but the product does not include this attache strap such an attache strap is very useful in the airports as i am pulling my luggage
i went to office depot , office max , and etc . . still , i like this style , so i search through amazon and found out the price is much better than retail store i like it very much , it is not too big , but enough for my daily work stuff
this is a fine option if you just need to transport a laptop and minimal extras it 's simple , so no fashion awards with this one it 's well made and fairly lightweight , but it just does n't have enough room to be functional a laptop fits fine but throw a charger and a few folders in and already your pushing the bag 's limits nice bag if your contents are minimal ... just was n't right for me
i got this bag for an oversized hp laptop there are ample pockets and enclosures i have n't traveled with it , but i gather that it would endure pretty well on the road
i am buying this item to replace an identical one i have had for over # years i have used mine to drag around papers , computers , files , stationery for almost # years on a daily basis it has traveled to # countries and been <unk> and thrown around it has survived travel , airport conveyor belts , rain , being thrown in the trunk of cars and being accidentally dropped more times than i can remember yet it is still ticking it is the perfect complement to a business suit or professional wardrobe i usually use the short handle when running around so the handle has become a little worn and does not look as professional when i go into a meeting or do a presentation , for example but the rest of the bag looks great otherwise and is totally intact it is roomy , classy looking and certainly looks like costs at least # to # times as much
this product is not advertised properly my # `` laptop does not even come close to fitting inside the interior dimensions are much smaller than advertised , so i had to return this purchase
i bought this neoprene sleeve to add some extra padding to my notebook bag my dell latitude d # fits very snugly in this sleeve , but i am not thrilled with the padding that it provides also the zipper only runs along one side - which is a problem for me because i have to slide my notebook in sideways into my notebook bag so i have to remove the sleeve completely to get to my notebook however , overall i am happy with the sleeve and will continue to use it
it did n't fit otherwise , it is about as expected i wanted a snug fit , but the information was not complete enough to get what i wanted my laptop measured # / # x # / # x # / # exactly this was close , but could n't zip up i bought a larger case logic that was cheaper but is n't as nice
i purchased the mobile edge # . # `` neoprene sleeve black from amazon.com and was very pleased the delivery was fast , and more importantly , the sleeve is a great buy it 's easy to carry around , looks nice , protects my computer and has a front pocket in which i can place my computer wires and other such things
pretty decent laptop case it provides <unk> protection , as it 's designed to do -lrb- it 's not deeply padded -rrb- and has a handy storage pocket one thing i think is missing is a shoulder strap pretty stylish and durable for the price
i have a dell inspiron # m and this sleeve fits it perfectly it is really well made and provides the perfect extra cushion for bringing my laptop with me to and from work and while travelling
perfect fit for a dell latitude d # works well , no problems so far i never use the pocket the neoprene material is relatively thin -lrb- at least compared to the last laptop sleeve i owned -rrb- , but i guess it still offers sufficient protection the handle is pretty useless , a more substantial one on top would be better
this sleeve is a good choice if you 're looking for one for the dell inspiron # i purchased it for under $ # meanwhile on dell 's site they 're selling one for nearly $ # it 's not entirely snug but enough space to slip the laptop in and out of it 's also thin enough to go into my messenger bag i think it 's a good fit if you 're putting it into a briefcase or similar bags the sleeve is a nice addition for stashing away small and thin items i do n't think i trust the strap but it 's not in the way
this bag is super huge i used it # time and just could n't maneuver with it on my back ! i live in ny and it is the most cumbersome thing ... also the <unk> to messenger back throws the whole center of gravity off so it tilts forward and it just is n't the greatest bag
it 's a well made bag , after having it for # months , i can tell you that it sits so low on your back you can very easily hurt ur back , it should be higher it is made well - good stitches and seams and it 's rugged
this is a pretty cool bag , but it takes up more space than i thought and it is more awkward than a backpack , especially in its backpack mode it protects laptops and ipads alike , very well but it makes me feel like i 'm caring a giant 's wallet i 'm a pretty big guy , so
i am extremely happy with this purchase i had bought the smaller , messenger-style bag from this manufacturer a year prior and was unhappy with the lack of pockets -lrb- and how quickly the seam of the single outer pocket split -rrb- and small inner compartment this bag has been an excellent replacement plenty of pockets and interior space to use my only complaint is how quickly the small , plastic fittings on the chest strap snapped i do n't use the chest strap very often , to be honest , so this is just a minor fly in the <unk>
this bag is very versatile and carries everything i want my only complaint is that it is too deep it can be difficult to retrieve folders from the bag because of the way it is designed otherwise , i like it
looking for a new messenger bag for work so i bought <unk> , liking the backpack option i love the number of pockets and the product itself seems <unk> durable if you get the xl it can almost double as a suitcase which is great if you commute or bring a lot of items with you to and from work every day after looking at the product further it seems very similar to my current bag so i am returning this particular one for something different nothing wrong with the product though and it would be a great fit for the right person
i carry a dell vostro # , -lrb- so-so computer at best , great screen though -rrb- and because of the weight / size i was looking for a good carry solution this bag is the one i picked after a little research i never have been <unk> with laptop backpacks in general , and i wanted something more like a messenger bag exterior access of laptop is very handy at the airport security point the bag handles my laptop -lrb- barely -rrb- in the dedicated section no documentation : it will take a minute to figure out the right flip to convert the messenger strap to a backback strap however , once done and on your back , the pak carries low against your backside and the weight is barely noticeable because of the low carry / low center of gravity , there is minimal affect on your posture while you carry it in that mode overall i am very pleased with the bag the nylon straps below the padded shoulder section seem a little flimsy , -lrb- # `` -rrb- but are holding up fine so far
this bag is everything i wanted in a bag , both size and quality i ordered the xl bag although the large probably would have worked just fine my one & # # ; little & # # ; complaint all of the buckles , clasps it 's a little cumbersome nonetheless , this is a top notch bag that i will continue to purchase as long as they make them very pleased with my purchase
this bag is very well constructed it has so much room , i can literally carry everything and then some i recommend buying the divider pocket for the main compartment from bbp
i bought this exact bag about six years ago and used it until it finally wore out it 's super durable , but i used it a lot so , it served its purpose i did a few hours of research when it came time to replace the bag and ended up <unk> that this is still the best one out there for my needs it 's got lots of gadget pockets , great durability , and it 's comfortable to carry around
this is my second the first one lasted # years it works as a backpack , brief case , or messenger bag with all sorts of useful pockets for accessories , chargers , etc .
i ordered the mcklein <unk> because i wanted the ability to use the strap on the back , with the wheels installed , to slide it over my other bag 's handle the product delivered was the <unk> -lrb- that 's what the tag on it says -rrb- , but with the damen wheel system note the damen has a plastic wheel system with no strap i 'm sending back to exchange for the correct product i saw one other review with the same complaint - when i ordered i was hoping they had fixed the problem look at the picture <unk> - give the customer what they ordered for what it 's worth , the bag looks nice
i bought this for my husband he has to leave the wheeled cart at home because it does n't fit under the seat on a plane that kind of defeats the purpose of buying this i also was n't thrilled with the look of the leather it was shiny and <unk> looking - like fake <unk> we 'll see how it holds up
nice piece , except the luggage does n't really come apart all that easy from the wheel mount and too many loose pieces i also thought when i bought this all i had to do was unzip it in half and lay it open while passing through security at the airports as it is , the laptop still has to be removed from the luggage
after lugging a backpack through airports , and about killing my back and shoulders , i finally broke down & got a case with wheels it came on time , and everything looks great i went to utah with the backpack , and had this shipped there so i could use it on the way home i was a little worried because the airplane was one of the smallest & i was n't sure this would fit in the overhead compartment i figured i could always take the wheels off & stow them under the seat , but it turned out not to be necessary i did n't have it completely stuffed & expanded , but i had more than i would usually carry , so if it fit that airplane , it will work anywhere
it 's , a nice bag i like that i can <unk> the wheeled frame this product replaced two swiss army bags , both had failed extendable handles , totally frustrating in an airport two complaints , one minor , one major minor , the front organizer leaves a bit to be desired major , the leather is way too thin for luggage one will have to be very careful not to damage this bag this bag will not <unk> haste i give this bag a b -
i love the case , but the bottom does not fit the new macbookpro # `` notebook perhaps it fit the old one this was a disappointment i had this happen # years ago when i bought the casing forthe # `` macbookpro it seems that the <unk> do not keep up with were the <unk> be in the bottom side of the case i am using the top happily as i did the # `` <unk> i am disappointed
almost perfect fit for my # `` mp , the key board cloth leaves something to desire , it claims you can remove it wash it and re apply it , i have n't done that yet
the sheet fit the <unk> perfectly i have n't tried it , but i think it would be difficult to remove it if you wanted to the pad covering the keyboard is a great idea , but it <unk> at the # corners maybe it will relax in time
can be a bit difficult to line up properly around the trackpad , but once it 's in position this thing is awesome provides a nice soft , cushy surface to rest your palms as you type i wish it came in a black version so that oils and sweat from the hands would n't be so visible over time , but luckily it 's easy to clean i purchased one for my # `` and also my # `` <unk> it will definitely help keep your mac 's resale value high
the cover for the aluminum around the touch pad really works great as a integrated mouse pad i you use a mouse with your macbook would highly recommend takes some work to get on without wrinkles but it has been well worth it for me i do n't use the cover for the keyboard do n't really know the point
i have the all metal # `` macbook pro with silver keys i bought my laptop in # i was worried this protection pad would not work on my computer since i do n't have the brand new macbook pro , but it fits perfectly it 's easy to apply and when i pulled a corner off to see if a residue would be left there was no residue and i could adhere the pad again be careful not to pull your pad too tight when applying it it can stretch out of shape a little
i just purchased a new laptop and needed a new carry bag for it i saw this item and knew it was the one for me boy , was i wrong the item states that it is designed to fit a laptop with a # `` screen when i received the bag , i attempted to place my laptop in it and the bag was a good # inches too small after doing some <unk> , i found this is a common problem with this company 's bags just a head 's up if you own a computer with a # `` <unk> , do not buy this bag ! ! it will not fit your system
i have a # . # `` mac book pro and when i recieved the bag it was way too small i tired extremely hard to fit my computer in it and it was n't going to fit the title for the bag is very misleading it says # `` but when you recieve the bag and on the tag the <unk> read # `` outside and # . # `` inside they need to <unk> this item becuase of how it is misleading
when i read a couple other reviews about stains on this laptop bag , i never in a million years imagined i would get a product with stains i just received it today , and the canvas has a boot print -lrb- yes , a boot print -rrb- and heavy dirt stains on the edges of the fabric i can see the original color of the fabric on a # `` x # `` spot where something was obviously laying on the bag -- while the rest of it collected dust who in their right mind would ship something in this condition obviously not someone who cares about quality or their customers otherwise , it 's a fairly cute bag , but i ca n't get over a company that sends out flawed products -- repeatedly , probably <unk> , just to get rid of them
this is a great bag i originally saw it and it 's smaller version on dell 's website as well as <unk> <unk> 's it was much cheaper here however , my # `` laptop just barely fits so there is no way larger screens would fit even though the sizing is incorrect , i still love it it has just enough space for the computer and some additional pockets for my other things i like the bag and get compliments all the time
it is okay it does not look like real leather , but you get what you pay for it is constructed well it has a terrible chemical smell to it after a week or so it is beginning to subside it smells like old fish : -
i love this pouch ! looks very nice and the macbook air fits perfectly this is definitely the way to go to have a nice pouch without paying a lot of money
i really like this case it fits very well the only downside , it is that is not leather , is plastic , and looks like plastic not like those really good fake - plastic items , but regular plastic but anyway , it is good for the price , and is light and small a good buy in the end , but i 'll be happy to buy this again - if made from real leather
it 's nice and looks just like the picture it 's the <unk> size for that laptop but you ca n't use it if the laptop has another case , cause then it does n't fit so good
very happy with this case for my new mba # `` fits it perfectly magnetic clip works the case is also not too thick whilst providing good protection would recommend if you are after something different to a cheap neoprene slipcase
although it is well built and functions as designed , the material texture appearance on advertisement looked much better than the actual however because it is well priced , i am fully satisfied and will most likely buy from them again in the future
looks like a folder the fit was a bit tight when i first got it , still is but not to bad it 's really cool because it looks like a nice folder , very smooth leather - worth the buy :
the mac air messenger is just as most other reviewer described it it is well constructed it has a real leather feel it holds the laptop snug but still easy to get it in and out it looks very presentable yet not flashy at all
i originally <unk> this item from this supplier but the item was cancelled because the stock had not been received in time i then searched for another similar item but was glad that i was unsuccessful i re-ordered this item when it was in stock and was so glad that i waited it is perfect it is a most elegant solution i feel good each time i take it out of my briefcase it fits perfectly , protects the laptop , and looks expensive , though it is not i highly recommend this item
this case is inexpensive but does n't feel cheap , fits the new version of macbook air great , and has a nice interior the closure on the front holds as it should if i put the air in slim side first , i can have the power plugged in and still close the flap fits well in my backpack
the case does exactly what i anticipated , holds my air snug and safe i usually just slip this in my backpack along with my other school work and i do n't have to worry about the standard scuff and damages from travel
i just got this last week and i already love it it 's a very nice professional looking case for the macbook air i wanted something that did n't cost too much but still looks good this was exactly what i was looking for it fits my computer perfectly the only drawback is that it 's not real leather , but that 's why it only costs $ # and not $ # i would highly recommend this case for anyone with a macbook air # ``
this fits the macbook air # `` perfectly macbook slides in snugly and stays in place during transport case is somewhat rigid and slick which should be easy to keep clean while providing protection from bumps and spills the fold over flap does catch well with the magnet , but still maintains a slim overall profile good looking case for the money
my original -lrb- version zero -rrb- zeroshock cases are <unk> of # st century design and engineering strong , sleek , protective , efficient this thing is a huge disappointment floppy , <unk> materials , and a stupid zipper on the top that catches on other items in my bag ... damaging books and notepads i 'm not saying there is much better out there for a real foam case , but i just wish shinza would do a better job last time i ended up <unk> a case logic cordura covered memory foam sleeve i found for half the price shinza should just go back to their original designs for a marked improvement over the last two styles ... and just offer it in more sizes to keep pace with the <unk> laptop and tablet market
this is a pretty nice case overall i bought it because it had that egg <unk> cushioning as the padding for the inner case i thought the bumps would be bigger to be honest and when i pushed one in with a bit of pressure , it never came back up so i got about # cushion bumps that seem to be forever depressed inwards which bothers me still its a good case with a nice feel and the inner zipper line is cushioned too so you do n't have to worry about the laptop rubbing against it just do n't try to push any of the bumps in
bought this for a thinkpad x # holds notebook tight enough that is does not move around at all within the sleeve have not tested it but looks like it would provide decent protection even for a corner drop due to the `` rim `` around the inside faces does add a decent amount of length and width to the form factor of the notebook , mine will barely squeeze into a backpack pocket made for a # ``
i have used zeroshock cases for many years it is slightly more expensive than neoprene case , but in my opinion , offers much more protection against bumps and rough handling the inside of the case is made from memory foam that absorbs shocks much more effectively than neoprene or sponge foam this case will hold notebook pc sizes of # . # to # . # inches the case exterior is <unk> , soft and matte finish synthetic material , which should be more durable than fabric materials no small case can protect a notebook pc from a drop of # feet or more , so you should still exercise care
i bought this case last year for my lenovo x # cell laptop it 's a perfect fit i absolutely love this case , and i feel weird any time i do n't have my laptop in the case i feel like i could throw this across the room -lrb- and that 's not only a <unk> to <unk> quality ! -rrb- as far as the zippered pocket is concerned , i use it for screen cleaning wipes and an iphone cable , it really would be a tight fit for much else in my opinion -lrb- without risking <unk> the material oh , and it looks super slick
this item works great for the # `` macbook pro aluminum with the black keyboard i can place the laptop in the case and then insert it into my back pack and travel , without advertising i have a expensive laptop to steal the egg shell foam protects the aluminum laptop nicely from dents while traveling this is a much better alternative then encasing the entire laptop in plastic covers , because they add unnecessary weight and hinder the dissipation of heat from the base also , a bulky cover takes away from the natural lines and <unk> of the aluminum finish no complaints so far this thing works as advertised and the zipper opens and closes with ease
this case fits my lenovo u # it has a # . # in screen so i dont have to worry about it getting cracked or damaged i can brace my back against the wall of the train while on my commute to my college strong case , nice feel this is a must buy
i bought this sleeve to put my macbook in a backpack it is padded enough , and the outside is a nice fabric one of the tabs on the zipper broke after # months the included keyboard cover is a flimsy waste of money buy a keyboard cover from <unk> instead i 'd look at other sleeves with a little more padding and a zipper that has no danger of scratching the laptop
this is a great cover , almost impossible to scratch the computer with the zipper and it holds it snug in place i would recommend this hands down the only negative thing i have to say is that the cover is n't exactly thick , a drop of any kind would probably not end well that might be a little <unk> seeing as this product never claimed to cover that kind of thing it is perfect to use when carrying around inside a backpack etc to protect it from scratches though the grey is a great color and i really do love it
it is the good sleeve for macbook to protect and have the piece of microfiber for protect keyboard that might contact to the screen if you have macbook , this one is match with yours
i looked for a long time to find the right case for my new macbook this is a very good case it fits snug to th computer , has an elastic inside that holds the computer in place when u open it and as an extra , comes with a <unk> to clean the screen
a coworker suggested i purchase one of these when i bought my macbook it is a must for any macbook i ca n't imagine what my macbook would look like now without using this sleeve the sleeve is a perfect fit for my macbook the sleeve also has a nice color it provides additional <unk> padding , which is a functional purpose of having it in the first place if you are going to shell out $ # or more for a macbook , you might as well spend a little more money to protect it
marware 's protective products are the only ones that i use for my ipods and apple computers that said , they have never failed me fit and <unk> however , the zipper on my laptop sleeve broke it still works too well to replace ... but no zipper d : < similarly , the wrist strap on my marware sports ipod case tore off while i was <unk> , leaving my ipod <unk> from my earphones again , the case itself is still usable -lrb- three years of intense use later -rrb- , but the wrist strap is <unk> from my own experience with their <unk> products , i think that their products are well-made -lrb- in fact , the best out there -rrb- , but sometimes the extra features are not up to par
the sleeve is very soft and fits my white macbook perfectly however , after about a one year ownership , the rubber zipper <unk> -lrb- `` marware `` logo -rrb- ripped apart where the rubber handle meets the metal latch that was definitely disappointing , since the rubber <unk> was very handy otherwise , the sleeve itself is great
this is a very good protective cover for the macbook i used it on a trip recently and really liked it it definitely is a great sleeve for the # `` macbook the only drawback is that there is not room for the power cord or any other cable or cord
i use this everyday in a college environment it encases my macbook # `` perfectly easy to put into the sleeve as well as easy to take out the only improvement that i would suggest is that the external pouch be larger to hold an external # . # `` drive , not just an ipod
so , as a disclaimer , i 've had this case about # days , but so far i really like it it fits my mbp # `` really well , and i love the zipper protection flap that prevents the computer from getting scratched the pocket is really small , on the downside , and you can not fit the charger into it , but it does fit my iphone or ipod
my dell laptop is # -inches in length by # . # -inches wide , however it does not fit in this sleeve the length of the sleeve is too short as the zipper wo n't close
bought this for my boyfriend 's # . # inch hp laptop and its great fits like it was made for it good quality product to protect the laptop while in a larger bag overall , happy so far with the product though he 's only been using it for a couple weeks
very good laptop sleeve i would n't trust it to protect my # `` dell from any serious damage , but the neoprene is sturdy and protects it from scratches and minor bumps and such the only thing i wish was different was if the zipper was slightly wider ; it can be a bit of a hassle to get the computer in quickly also , the blue sleeve is darker than it appears in the picture it 's not navy blue , but it 's not bright blue either
the product is well made and nice , but it is difficult to put a # `` notebook in it it fit so tight that i think it was made for another size , but not , it is for # `` to # `` notebook
the built sleeve is perfect for my # . # `` laptop , to prevent scratches and provide cushioning the sleek curves on the sides make it easy to carry around the only thing is that it does n't have a pocket to store your charger , but this is the case with most sleeves since it 's assuming you have a bag or backpack to carry it in
this product was very eye catching and contemporary , but when i received it it did n't fit my laptop my notebook is # `` , so i bought a size medium it appears as if the built ny company did n't take into consideration that most laptops are not built in an hour glass shape like they made their sleeves my computer would have fit length-wise , but it was impossible to get it through because the way the sleeve curves you 'd think they would have caught this and adjusted their sizes accordingly
i have a <unk> <unk> with a # . # `` screen and have had to push pull and squeeze to get into into this sleeve , but i can zip it up -lrb- just -rrb- the <unk> features are the colour , seemingly heavy duty zipper and the neoprene -lrb- wetsuit -rrb- fabric next time would think twice and probably buy the # `` sleeve -lrb- even if it is to big -rrb-
despite being told by built ny that this size sleeve should fit my t # , it was too narrow while i could have exchanged it for the next size up , i did n't because then it would have been way too long i suspect if it fits your notebook computer that it 'd be great
