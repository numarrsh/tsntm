i like it like i like the ipad cover but , it 's huge , if you like having a small computer , this case is n't for you i do like caring it around without a backpack , it 's protected and it 's <unk> . # stars if it was n't for the huge size
i 'm very happy with my new `` old looking `` laptop case from twelve south i get a lot of comments when people realise it 's not an old book i was a bit worried when i put my order in that it might not fit , but on arrival it fitted my <unk> perfectly i 'd recommend this product to anyone wanting something a little different
this cover gets compliments wherever i go it is thicker than expected it doubles the width of the macbook pro bought it for the look and am happy
the actual case is much larger than i anticipated it makes for a bulk object and an uncomfortable way to carry your laptop however , i have received numerous compliments and it will protect your computer like there is no tomorrow apparently a woman had a case like this around her ipad and when her apartment got robbed this was not stolen because it looked like an old book interesting enough , the product is well made and useful
like it a lot it does a great job of protecting my macbook had it for about # months now and it is holding together really well the top has faded nicely in that time enhancing its authentic look need to be a little cautious in warm weather as the macbook gets very hot encased in the cover
the quality of the materials is not exactly as good as i hoped , as i own the one for my iphone the iphone model is great good leather , stitching , etc . the macbook model looks rather cheap by comparison i do like how it looks , and since i will only use it when i travel , i expect it 'll work well enough
i have gotten so many compliments on this case no one can ever tell what it is before i open it , so i feel there is a bit of safety there while i feel my laptop is protected , the inside of the case accumulates a bit of <unk> because of the texture of the inside fabric the straps that are there to hold the laptop when it is open are not completely secure , but are useful if your laptop closes easily i would buy this again and recommend it to anyone looking for something unique
i really love this case it 's very attractive and unusual there is one drawback ... you ca n't actually use your laptop in the case because it slides all over the place it would seem to me that this could easily be corrected by adding elastic holders on both sides
i have had this case since # i really love it , however , the zipper has broken on it everything else about it is in great shape i have gotten many compliments on my case over the years i just wish that the zipper had n't gave out
i love the look of this case i get compliments on it all the time however , i am a college student and this case is heavy but very durable i love it however next time , i will get a lighter case
twelve south bookbook for # -inch macbook pro as far as laptop cases go , this is definitely <unk> than most , but you get what you pay for with this -- great construction and fit , <unk> over a year of use without trouble if the vintage book look grabs your fancy , this one <unk> plenty of compliments now i 'm looking to buy a bookbook for my ipad mini , because the first one has treated me so well
i got this for my sony vaio and it fits great feels nice , looks good , plus everyone is so super stoked on me if you 're thinking about this product i suggest you dig into that wallet and get it
keeps my laptop safe and is a fantastic conversation starter no one expects to find a laptop nestled in this old looking book plus , because it 's a worn look you do n't have to be too afraid of little dings and dents they just add character
the bookbook is a pricey case but worth every penny i 've had it for about three months and could n't be happier it does make your macbook a little heavier and bulkier , but offers protection at the same time i get compliments every time someone sees it
i bought this gem a few years ago , and use it as my daily computer carrying case all the time i 'm constantly asked what i 'm reading , or how old my book is also when i go on vacation and leave my computer in the hotel room and put it up against other books or items it hides how valuable my computer really is
it <unk> everyone no one would think of stealing a book , but really it 's your lap top . : -rrb- it 's a quality , durable , and stylish product the red is just a tad darker ; otherwise , true to color from vendor 's pics it has <unk> bands at the two top corners of the case to wrap on the corners of your lap top screen i have a mac book pro # & # # ; and fits perfect with the case open and when closed and zipped up serves it 's purpose
definitely the best case we could have ever bought for our daughter 's mac book she is the & # # ; <unk> of the ball & # # ; with this case at school it fits her mac perfectly and gives it the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> no other case can touch
this is a great purchase the quality of the build was amazing every one always thought it was a book over time it became distressed and looked amazing , it also smells great , and protected my mac
it is a very nice case and very original the covers are hard , the interior is padded it protects very good my macbook pro it looks as a very old book , a collection book
i am <unk> happy with this case , i mean , you can buy a lot of good cheaper ones , but the elegant look that this one gives its quite worth it and also , for the <unk> eye it disguises your precious mac book pro it 's a conversation starter and it really protects it as it is a hard cover book case i would definitely recommend it
i received this today visually it is a nice-looking item , however the material is hardly worth the price other than the binding this appears to be painted cardboard i <unk> to think what will happen to it if it gets wet from rain or a small spill i will <unk> this later if the initial feel and appearance prove to be misleading , but at this point i 'm very disappointed with this product for the price update : i promised to return to this later if my opinion changed from initial impression after well over a year i 'm happy to say that even after a wine spill at a cafe this has held up extremely well the form is amazingly as good as when i received it and spills wiped right off without damage i 'm changing my review to # stars
this is a little pricey but worth it it can still be charged with the computer in the case i get lots of compliments on it once people see its a case and not a <unk> really cool look
i 'm a & # # ; <unk> & # # ; so i needed something to protect my mac i love the fact that it 's compact , sturdy , and stylish it did n't add a significant amount of bulk i really appreciate the real leather , too
this is a great case for the mac book pro . it is super sturdy , very well made and looks like a book ! i think i love this case more than my mac book pro
i ordered one of these awhile back and i was extremely impressed in fact , i 'm using it now it is very sturdy and durable considering that i have roommates that like to toss my stuff all over the place that is the reason i bought it and so far it has saved my macbook pro multiple times and is showing no signs of damage the only thing i would suggest to make it a bit better would be to include small elastic straps on the bottom to hold the bottom corners of the computer it has them on the top to keep the screen attached to the case , but i find that my macbook slowly slides out of the case at the bottom during use it 's not a big deal though , just takes some getting used to definitely would n't prevent me from purchasing another one or recommending it to others
it fits great it is easy to use , well built and there is now no need for a lap desk between my legs and the macbook pro a little pricey , but proved worth it
after searching forever online to find this particular laptop case i was lucky enough to find that amazon sells them and i could n't be more pleased with the item it looks exactly like it does in the pictures and is very well made it 's exactly what i expected my only comment is that if you order a case for a macbook over # ' then the case might make your laptop too large to fit into a backpack if you 're a college student like i am otherwise , it 's wonderful
it 's too small to put anything in except your net book i would not recommend this for a # `` netbook although it looks nicer than the usual cases it just needs more storage space
my daughter is happy with this bag i got her she is ten and the strap is a little long for her and the charger does not fit in the bag other than that it is nice , fits her # . # samsung netbook
i have been using this netbook case for a few months it 's not big enough to fit the cord in the bag , so i use it as protection for my netbook and carry it all in my laptop bag
i got this for my wife 's asus netbook the computer fits snugly in the case without any problems it is not a totally hard case but it offers good protection against bumps
pelican makes great cases and this is one of them however , it is very time consuming to get your laptop in and out of this case you also have to pack your cord separately you have to open it upside-down to get enough <unk> and to keep from pinching your fingers you also have to take it completely out of you bag to open it and get your laptop out , which is very cumbersome in tight spaces like on a plane or in a car it keeps my laptop safe but it 's extremely inconvenient how this should be designed is have a cap end opening on either the long or short edge so you and slip it in and out vertically from your bag or backpack this would make this a million times easier to use
i purchased this case to protect my # `` macbook pro it 's an excellent fit however , there is no room for anything else , like the power supply this case should have been another # `` - # `` deeper to allow for the cutout for the power supply or other stuff with the power supply being carried separately there is a change for it to get lost other than that case is excellent would i purchase this case again no , i like to keep my essentials together in one place
i bought this for my macbook pro while i am deployed to <unk> it does a great job of protecting my laptop , it is not too bulky or too heavy i wish the shoulder strap was mounted to the lower half of the case , as it tends to get closed in the case and i would like to see a normal handle in addition to the shoulder strap having said that , it is a great case , it is only slightly bigger than the laptop and still fits into a backpack
the # cc is a great case , though the new model macbook pro is about # `` too wide for the foam insert it was pretty annoying when i saw this , but with a razor blade and some careful cutting , i got my computer to fit in nicely
i own a lot of pelican cases and like them all amazon shipped the # instead of the one pictured , and it is <unk> , as well as cheap looking the one pictured looks a lot better than the one they will send you it is n't an upgrade ; it 's the wrong product if it is discontinued , then take it off of here this is an edit : pelican support staff is excellent and sent me the case that i wanted free of charge complain enough to the correct people , and you 'll see how excellent their customer support staff is the pelican company alone has raised the rating from one to five stars cheers to them
just as advertised by amazon the product shipped quickly and arrives in a few days the price was significantly cheaper than other <unk> i am planning an extensive <unk> trip into northern canada where i will have to protect my laptop from severe weather and very wet conditions this box does the trick pelican has the reputation for being extremely weatherproof and the padding will help protect the computer from damage i carry the case with me while working outside here in rainy oregon and it has done the job well pelican is tops for wet <unk>
so i gave it # stars because its a great case for the right computer , but i got it for my # `` macbook pro and it was a little big the reason i ended up returning it is it did n't even fit in my shoulder bag -lrb- an rei brand laptop case -rrb- so i ended up getting the smaller # pelican case from amazon check out my review for it with pics
fits my notebook perfectly has protected it so far with no damage , i am on a heavy <unk> site in the middle of no where case has been dinged a couple of times , but shows not much wear for the work we do
i purchased this case just prior to my deployment to afghanistan and it worked out great this case fits perfectly in the issued <unk> pack i also cut some of the foam out of the lid and was able to fit my ipad and external hard drive in the case with my # in macbook pro i recommend this case for anyone <unk> who wants to keep there stuff safe
this case is maximum on the protection , while still allowing the case to fit in most back packs whoever wrote that they had to trim the foam for their # . # mpb is over exaggerating press in on the sides of the foam to compress it , and that 's it it fits like a charm well worth the money this is an investment i would go with you 're protecting a # + dollar macbook pro , it 's worth the # bucks for the piece of mind . =
very good product does exactly what is says in the <unk> i have used many of pelican 's fire service designed lights and tools and this case performs just as well , which is <unk>
this case is just as advertised a few things i could n't tell from the description # -rrb- the middle pocket -lrb- pictured with a kindle sticking out -rrb- does close with velcro # -rrb- the fabric between the middle pocket and the small outer pocket is just nylon , not neoprene the rest of the case is all neoprene i was a little amazed that it actually held the netbook , the power cord for the netbook , and my kindle all at once however , it loses much of it 's slimness when loaded up like that ; -rrb- also , despite what the description says , a mouse would not fit in the pocket with all the other stuff mentioned
very nice quality case for the # `` netbook the ac adapter and cord has a separate zippered pouch in the front the velcro closed middle pocket is for papers or a mini mouse
storage is a thoughtful and rare bonus feature with this virtually indestructible sleeve there is room enough for your pc , power source , memory sticks , sd cards , and even your owners manual i highly recommend this product
bought this for my son 's asus transformer it fits well and has plenty of room for accessories and any other trinkets he wants to shove in there it seems to be well made and the price is great
i bought the asus eee pc netbook for our oversea trip this netbook sleeve is perfect it is soft and protects the netbook from scratching when placed in my backpack the pockets fit the charger , headphones , and a flashdrive
what 's not to like about this little case it 's bright -lrb- i 've learned from <unk> experience that black is not a good idea as it blends with car <unk> , etc . and so gets lost -rrb- , protective and has plenty of pockets the price was right , and the netbook fits perfectly
very nice quality materials , with great fit and finish there is a neoprene gusset inside the main zipper , which protects my asus netbook and holds it tight inside the case inside the main compartment are <unk> of plastic sleeves for memory cards there are two outer compartments , one which runs the length and almost full height of the case , which closes with a strong velcro tab , and a very useful outer zippered compartment i 've used this every day since i bought it months ago and its in great shape my <unk> is asus # he with extra large battery i went with the bright orange because all the tech stuff i own seems to be black , and i can never find anything
man this is very safe for everything plus you can carry it anywhere and i bought this for my ipad but whats worth is that it can also fit tablets and
i saw another review about the smell and i thought they must just have a sensitive nose oh no , i do n't have a sensitive nose , and this thing is unbearable if i leave it in the living room , the whole living room smells like gasoline after about # minutes i ca n't believe they would release a product like this and actually sell it it 's noxious i 've now had it on my porch for # months to see if it would finish off-gassing and become more <unk> still smells too strong to want to have it around other roo case sizes do not have this problem i have a smaller one that is great this one is just terrible
no where on this page will you find what the product actually is it 's a `` # . # `` <unk> netbook sleeve `` you think they 'd list on the amazon page what the packaging says this means some thicker # . # inch laptops will fit well , and thinner ones will slide around on the inside the # . # `` samsung chromebook has too much free room , i do nor recommend this case for that laptop
i really like the product , but it smells really bad the zippers work well and there is a lot of room for stuff the rating for the product is a # and the awful smell knocks it down to # stars i have been airing it out trying to get the smell to <unk> without much success does anyone have suggestions for getting rid of the smell
a little bit bigger than the laptop i bought it for -lrb- does not fit quite as well as a similar sleeve i have for a different laptop -rrb- however love the neoprene , and the pockets should be quite useful
the case is well built and very functional a great value for the price i found the case to actually be approximately # inch too large in length and width i prefer a snug fit for my case so that i can easily stuff it in a backpack when traveling that is my only complaint not sure the case dimensions are quite accurate
the sleeve was a perfect fit for my # . # inch laptop - not too tight , not too loose the extra # pockets are also great the flat one holds # . # -inch documents , and the zippered pocket holds chargers , usb cables , flash drive , etc . the only thing i 'm not sure about is that the blue is a bit brighter than in a photo it 's sort of like a gym shorts blue , which makes me self conscious when i pull it out at work maybe i should 've gotten a black one
it fits my laptop perfectly i rarely use the zipper pouch , though it shows it being used to hold the charging cable , but for my laptop 's <unk> adapter , it makes the case super bulky i put a cleaning cloth and occasional <unk> calculator or something when i take it to class to take notes and such has kept my laptop safe and is a nice color
the product was exactly as described in the details i love it and would recommend to my friends looking for a similar product to check them out also speedy and efficient delivery
i have the # & # # ; macbook pro it is a little loose for my laptop then add in the curved edges and there is just tons of extra bulky fabric that i always have to squish into my backpack definitely would not recommend for the # & # # ; macbook pro
i love built products and am very happy with my purchase it fits my # `` lap top great and i love the look and feel of it my very minor complaint is that on my computer screen , the color scheme looked like a deep , rich , bright blue the blues looked like the caribbean ocean to me - i was expecting royal blues and teal when it came i saw it is really more navy blue and baby blue with some flat reds and <unk> still a great product , you always take a bit of a chance buying something on line and not in person
this is exactly what i needed it keeps my computer clean and tucked away it stretches so i can stick other things in there , like the power cord it 's nice to look at
i am a world traveler , i need a good sleeve to protect my precious laptop i have a # . # inch toshiba and this fits my lap top perfectly got it in two days thanks to amazon prime and am very pleased with it it 's pretty well padded and will hold up -lrb- hopefully -rrb- plus , the design is attractive and it 's definitely well made for the price , it 's well worth it
it 's very nice for storing , and carrying the laptop itself , but it 's pretty <unk> because not much of anything else will fit i 've figured out how to get the power cord in there by separating the cord , and putting the `` brick `` in the outside netting even then it will barely zip , and the brick being on the outside adds some odd bulk i doubt i would have made this purchase if i had known all this ahead of time
this is a very nice laptop bag for an <unk> m # x fit and finish is very nice i like how it has venting on the bottom so you do n't have to take it out
i was searching for a bag for my new laptop and came across this showed my husband and had to order one for him also we are both very pleased with this bag love the way it sits in it and has a venting material where the fan is mobileedge did a great job on this -- we are going to enjoy these for a long time
i got this for basic protection for my ipad the front pocket has good storage space for the charger and other accessories , though it looks bulky when you put too many things in the outer pocket i do n't think this would totally protect my ipad from a fall , but if you want something that 's not always mounted on your ipad , this could be for you
love this ipad case not only does it hold the charger and various cords in the side pocket but it also protected my ipad when it was accidently dropped my only issue is that the zipper broke on the side pocket a week or so after my purchase so i can only partially zip it closed still , it is a great ipad case and would purchase again
not to be <unk> <unk> , but it 's a great price and fit my ipad # + logitech keyboard/cover perfectly nice to have an outside zippered storage , ` not sure how much protection if dropped
this case works well for the ipad it is a little bigger than <unk> , but the flap at the top helps to hold the ipad securely the flap does make it a little bit harder to get the ipad out quickly , but it is a really minor inconvenience good zippers and the pocket in front is nice for storing the cable and accessories
fits lots of things in the accessory pocket only complaint is that the seams are not the <unk> already looks like its coming apart but overall great bag will buy again if it does come apart it 's just such a versatile option
i ordered # of these for all the ipad 's that we use at work and they are fantastic the front storage pouch is great for adapters the pouch itself is durable and high quality zipper quality is great as well this is a great product for ipads
it is simple and sleek it has a cushioned feel , so if you were to drop it , i would feel confident it would withstand all or most of the impact the outer pocket holds and few things , it stretches , so we put our cords in there and they fit well
this is the best case for the ipad i have a leather case on my ipad and it fits in this stretchable covering case as well i love the pouch which i max out to the fullest with plugs and cables just be careful of the zipper i bought two for a reason the first one i zipped it too tight and got a <unk> in the zipper
bought it for very little money , and it is just great quality and a real convenience put your ipad in the main case , and put your ear buds in the side pocket
i use an apple magnetic screen cover most of the time , but i needed something more for when i was traveling or taking my ipad out in bad weather this is perfect small , lightweight and fits it perfectly
i purchased this for my husband 's ipad to keep stylus , keyboard , and charger in one place this is a very useful pouch , as everything fits neatly inside he uses it all of the time the outside zipper pocket is great for the stylus and charger , so they are not by the ipad
i bought this for my wife 's netbook . fit and finish is great , outside zipper pouch a little tight for the power cord but will hold smaller items such as a mouse or smaller
if you want a full sleeve for your ipad , this is the way to go it fits perfectly snug with my ipad -lrb- # rd generation -rrb- and logitech bluetooth keyboard seems very durable -lrb- especially the zippers -rrb- and it 's cushioned just enough without making it too bulky it was delivered on time and even exceeded my expectations definitely would order again
i orderd this to better protect my ipad and the wonderful keyboard i have -lrb- zagg -rrb- it fits both the ipad and the keyboard very well leaving minimal room for wiggle not only does it do this but it also has the second front pocket while i have not used it extensively i can already tell that it will be great for headphones , charger , etc . . additionally i was very pleased with the zipper it is common to get a very nice product , however the zipper is sub-par the zipper is nice and smooth and not <unk> like many in my opinion this is the best sleeve out there and with this great price you can not go wrong if you are looking for a sleeve to protect you ipad than look no further , this is the winner
this case is straight up awesome it looks great , it has some cool alienware logos on it and it 's just one of those things that looks overall awesome on your laptop the only problem is that the zippers do not fit properly over the corners of the m # x and they end up leaving tiny <unk> in the plastic on the corners if you are cool with putting your <unk> laptop in something that damages it -lrb- albeit not much -rrb- then get this case if you 'd rather keep your gear as pristine as possible , i 'd look elsewhere
being that this item was specifically designed for the m # x i would have expected a slightly better fit the laptop has to really be wiggle and jammed down into the sleeve once it is in the sleeve it is fine and looks like it would have decent protection it does have a nice little flap inside the zipper that protects the edge of the laptop from the zipper so it does n't get scratched up there is absolutely no room for anything else in this sleeve however , so you will need to carry the power brick separately
i just got the laptop the other day and needed a good cover after reading several reviews , i thought the one made especially for my laptop would be the one , and it works great other reviewers concerns over tight fit are right on one account ... the snug fit makes a perfect fit and eventually loosens up a bit to make the computer slide right in and out the side pocket is just fine for wiping cloths or anything fairly bendable i even put the power pack in for a short trip and , although not perfect , worked out fine i 'm very happy with this purchase best thing ... no more pulling it out going through security because the tsa says i can leave it in the sleeve
this laptop sleeve is fantastic , is very strong , and all around is a wonderful product my laptop fits snugly inside , and i do not have to worry about scuffs or other damages from books in my bag , or have to worry about rain ruining it , if i get caught off guard
great travel protection when i travel with the alienware m # x i keep it in this protective sleeve and simply place it on the airport scanner on occasion tsa personal do n't see the backup of items exciting the scanner mostly the problem is <unk> travelers bin 's get knocked around and i have <unk> items fall out of the bin 's . this sleeve fits perfect and cradles the m # x laptop with neoprene it also allows the laptop to still easily fit inside my briefcase this product is highly recommended mobile edge alienware netbook sleeve - notebook sleeve - # . # `` -
the alienware netbook sleeve fit my alienware m # x perfectly , to the point where it takes a little effort to put the laptop in front pocket is useful for small objects such as flash drives
bought this for an asus transformer tablet and it works great really like the fit and build quality of the alienware the cardboard and foam insert for shipping work great to leave in when i just carry the tablet plan on just using the foam when the keyboard dock comes in
the m # x fits in the main compartment perfectly the top zipper compartment i can fit everything else it is big enough to hold my samsung dvd drive , razer <unk> mouse and <unk> mouse pad , and the power supply this is perfect for my use and holds every thing i need , top quality and at a great price if you have an m # x , you need this
firstly , this review was written by someone who has an alienware mx # laptop this laptop sleeve is fantastic , is very strong , and all around is a wonderful product my laptop fits snugly inside , and i do not have to worry about scuffs or other damages from books in my bag , or have to worry about rain ruining it , if i get caught off guard great product if you own an alienware mx # -lrb- which you should , if you are even looking at this product review in the first place
the quality feels great got this as a gift for the wife 's m # x she loves the material , and the padding is sufficient and on par with other sleeves i 've purchased before it goes perfectly well with the alienware styling not much to say beyond that i 'd recommend it i 'll post back if after some time it falls apart , but it seems like it will last the life of the laptop
sturdily constructed of thick neoprene , this sleeve fits my am # x like a , well , like a glove the zipper side pocket is just roomy enough to hold my a/c adapter , slim usb dvd -lrb- targus dvd rom external dvd -rrb- and my <unk> <unk> -lrb- for # g connectivity on the go -rrb- it 's a little lumpy , but organized , protected and easy to carry the zippers are tough and heavy weight too i 'm surprised and pleased by the well thought out , heavy duty construction oh yeah , one more thing : it looks pretty cool
this bag is very nice , but i was expecting a more turquoise blue color this is a true baby blue , not the color that is pictured here had i known , i would have gone with a different color choice i realize it states baby blue in the description , but that could <unk> many color <unk> . so if you order this keep in mind it is truly a baby blue color
i have a dell # `` laptop and use this case to carry it to and from work each day <unk> pockets are useful it is good value for the money
it 's hard to find a # inch case for us large laptop users so i was happy to find this one there are lots of places to put the things you need along with your laptop it 's functional , stylish and worth the price
my wife loves the color she gets complements all the time boring black is fine for me ; however , the bag 's pretty sleekness makes her feel better about lugging the behemoth around
there is a pocket for just about everything in this bag it is made well , and fir my big laptop , where as in other carriers they were always too small
my sister received a laptop for graduation and she needed a laptop bag , however because of the size of her laptop , most bags were too small i was happy when i found this one for her graduation present from me -lrb- and so was she ! -rrb- because it was the right size for her laptop and in her favorite color she loves it - no complaints here
i bought this for my son for college to go along with his tablet it is very small compared to other packs i have bought for my boys over the years i hope he likes it it looks like fine quality very nicely padded inside to protect this electronics i 'm hoping he likes it
bought it a couple of months back and loved it the matte black color was what i wished and it was tailor made for me only and the cushioned and soft laptop compartment wo n't let your laptop get even a single scratch the zips glides smoothly and the small bottle pockets was what i was actually looking for in my laptop carrying bag its stylish and yet spacious i will definitely recommend it to all those who are not die hard fans of swiss bags
one <unk> pocket for laptop has fuzzy padding on one side only the other side is nylon or something i strongly recommend a laptop sleeve as noted in other reviews , zippers are <unk> , but functional i use a backpack instead of an attache of any kind due to amount and bulk of the other stuff i need to carry when on the road overall , lots of storage space for those needing to carry : power strip , power adapter thingie , extension cord , <unk> # cable , usb mouse , <unk> , headset , bamboo tablet , books , cds
from the photo , this backpack looks incredibly roomy , does n't it it 's not as roomy as it looks , but other than that it 's pretty good today i was at school and i had my laptop , a # . # -inch binder full of paper , and a spiral notebook i ended up having to carry the binder separately , because there was no way to fit it in the backpack along with the notebook and the laptop the laptop pocket is well-padded and i think it will do a good job of protecting my computer i also like that this laptop has a lot of small pockets for all my junk i just wish it had a little more space for school books
