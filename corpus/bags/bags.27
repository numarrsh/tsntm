this alienware <unk> messenger bag is very sturdy for my sager x # . # inch laptop i wanted to carry my x # close to me -lrb- daily public transportation -rrb- and therefore removed the plastic ` quick checkpoint ' screening but keep the <unk> padding
it is a great bag lots of storage and pockets i have a alienware <unk> it better fit one tiny complaint there is a pocket on the back and the bottom is not sewn shut i almost lost some letters because of it other than that i really like the bag
the size is large enough to hold a full frame camera with a long zoom lens attached plus one or two additional lenses , flash and other accessories , i.e . it 's spacious however , it is also bulky and clumsy , and not very appealing after carrying it as a messenger bag for couple hours , it started bothering my back and shoulder but in total fairness , i was n't using the waist belt that comes with it the bottom line is that i wo n't be using it much and would be hesitant to recommend it
in my search for a more `` executive looking `` camera bag for my <unk> , i found the <unk> # aw shoulder bag from the pictures and reviews i was stoked and immediately picked it up -lrb- love messenger bag type camera bags -rrb- after receiving the product i was less <unk> , this thing is huge the pictures really do not do it justice with regards to how big this thing actually is you 're not going to run out of space for keeping lenses or larger full frame dslr 's however it comes at a <unk> cost the thing by itself weighs quite a bit and once you put in all your gear it weighs a whole lot more the construction of the bag is nothing to <unk> at which i was happy with but the size really did not make me happy what 's worse is that the strap they provided was not comfortable at all given the size and weight this thing would end up being with all the gear in it the dividers worked well providing lots of flexible space and the look is definitely sweet , but the sheer size and weight killed the deal for me to have this bag be great on travels
this bag is what i was looking for to carry # dslr with medium size lens so i can just switch cameras instead of changing lenses built quality is excellent , maybe a little too much on the padding for the <unk> dividers there are plenty of exterior storage pockets but are not <unk> to use them because it will make the bag look even fatter than it already is , not to mention the weight you need to be big and tall in order to make the bag look portable and ` slim ' . i highly <unk> this bag only if you need to carry # dslr carrying extra lenses and accessories will <unk> break your shoulders one of these days
the saving grace of the bag weight is the handle on top it 's such a nice feature that more bags should <unk> it 's really nice to be able to grab the top of the bag by the handle when i need to shift positions for any reason -lrb- like getting in and out of seats or cars -rrb- it also helps for when i just want to pick the bag up off the floor and quickly move it somewhere an a + feature that more bags should have
with the promotional reward i got to put on this , the bag cost me $ # . # absolutely shocked that i got this $ # bag for that without the reward still would have only cost $ # does n't get any better than this bag would recommend this for anyone who wants to carry a camera , camcorder , computer and all the necessary things that go with them only thing for me that it does n't conveniently carries is my <unk> pod still rate it a # out of #
i required a bag that does n't tell everyone that there is expensive camera equipment inside i shoot in the city and try to avoid putting a target on my back the bag is beautifully crafted , understated and well designed for <unk> access without having to set it down this allows be to get to the gear on the fly which keeps me mobile and safe love the bag
i bought this case over a year ago and i was happy with it for the first couple of months it is of great build quality , it has awesome colors , and its durable one problem i had with it was that it came in the box with the <unk> in it that never came out , not a big problem but i love aesthetics another problem i had was that it got really dirty after a couple months of heavy use and cleaning it did n't help the bright pink turned into a very dull <unk> i tried hand washing but that did n't change anything , i also have a neoprene case from case logic that got really dirty but a wet hand towel washed everything off not with this one , you 'd think that since they are made of the same material that it should work and the color should n't fade also , it is an awkward shape to store in a backpack or bag if you put something in the front pocket -lrb- like the power adapter -rrb- it did not fit inside my backpack nicely with the adapter in the front pocket
i purchased this sleeve for my new lenovo s # netbook and it 's a perfect fit there is n't really any room for cords and such , but i got it to protect the netbook when i put it into a larger messenger bag or briefcase well made , correct but not tight fit , and attractive great to grab and go if you 're headed to the coffee shop and do n't need the cords unlike a lot of sleeves i looked at , this is the correct size for a netbook -- the computer does n't swim in it nor do you need a shoe <unk> to get it in excellent value for the price
i purchased this sleeve for my new dell # . # inspiron mini the notebook fits easily inside the main compartment , and the zipper pocket is large enough for the a/c adapter and my wireless logitech v # mouse added bonus : it 's really cute
i got this for my wifes little samsung notebook and it works just great it has enough room for her mouse and flash drive it is stretchy so she could probably get more in good product that is really durable
a perfect fit for the acer aspire one netbook with plenty of room for cables , cards , and drives soft neoprene all the way around will keep the acer safe zippers shut so the computer wo n't slide out ample room in an outside zippered pocket for cards , cables , and drives a second outside pocket secured by velcro provides extra storage for paper , etc . there 's a strong , rubbery odor when the package is first opened , but it quickly dissipates a perfect pink bag for a perfect pink machine !
i purchased this item to protect my acer laptop and it is great has two outer pockets to put your cables and anything else you want it 's really soft and holds alot i like it very much
my first trip with my new # `` light weight laptop would have been better if i had purchased this when i bought the computer i ordered the hot pink case and it just fits looks nice and `` girlie `` and has some pockets so that i could actually use it as a purse when i have the laptop in it it keeps the computer safe and looks and feels good
i bought this for my wife to go with her netbook it 's a stretchy spongey type of material seem 's very durable it has # pockets on one side with one that zips there is no place to add a strap for the <unk> although it is small enough to fit in a backpack nicely
i am using this with acer aspire # . # inch netbook outside pockets are nice but the velcro that holds open sleeve just came off both sides and it can not secure item anymore i was expecting better quality for this product
i recently purchased this product for my # `` acer aspire netbook with the # `` battery a very tight fit that you need to really <unk> sleeve to make it fit around the netbook it would probably work perfect for the # . # acer netbook got it since it was recommended <unk> with the netbook by amazon do not purchase if you have the # . # inch acer aspire otherwise , the product seems well made
i purchased this sleeve to protect my new # -inch acer netbook it 's a tight fit because the netbook 's # -cell battery sticks out a bit , but the sleeve is elastic and with a slight tug it fits just fine the side pocket holds the power supply and a flash drive this sleeve was inexpensive and does the job what else could you ask for i recommend it
does the trick fits my samsung nc- # perfectly the gray trim makes it look a little cheap -lrb- in my opinion -rrb- if this was completely black it would look alot better well made and looks like it will hold up a while definitely worth the $ to keep my netbook protected
i 've been searching for a sleeve that would hold my mini # `` laptop with the extended life battery attached i wanted one by built ny but their sleeve would not accommodate for my bulky battery so i opted for this little guy and so far it 's working out great i 've had it about a month and am still pleased it 's not bulky at all and it fits right in my purse
i purchased this for my asus # he to add a bit more room and style over the provided one it came with it fits like a glove not too tight not too loose but just right the extra storage pouches are <unk> for a mouse , pair of headphones , and your power cable considering the # he 's power block it tiny it fits quite well this case offers great protection from scratched and liquids however , i would not drop this and expect any protection it 's a nice `` sleeve `` that you use when your carrying it all in another bag such as your back pack for school or purse for the ladies
this is a nicely made sleeve it is inexpensive but well constructed and easy to use i recommend this purchase if you are looking to get an effective product at a low cost
would accommodate a larger netbook , so there 's a bit of extra room zipper construction is solid the extra zipper pocket is the <unk> in the hole though - a separate compartment to carry the ac adapter and perhaps a small wireless mouse is perfect and keeps the netbook from getting scratched by the accessories
i use this case to carry my netbook or my portable dvd player it is a perfect fit for both devices and the front pocket holds the power & other connection cables also can slip a small portable mouse in if needed construction is great quality and i would recommend this to all my friends who had similar devices
this sleeve fits my hp mini # . # `` screen like a glove i really like the front zip and middle velcro pockets as well for carrying flash drives and notes this case is very good quality and i 'm very happy with this purchase would def buy again
this bag lasted a week before the shoulder strap pad frayed at the seams i had read about that on other reviews , so i guess it 's a common problem for this bag i returned it
i purchased this case # months it 's great for passing through airport security , but on a recent trip i noticed the internal flap that velcros to the partition covering the computer has ripped at the seam this is a weak spot that the manufacturer could of used thicker fabric
i 've had this for # months now and if i had to do it over again , i would have sprung more money for a better briefcase if you travel by air a lot , it might be worth your while with all the tsa bull **** you have to go through but for everyday use , there are better this case has velcros galore i mean , it 's okay for little pockets here and there , but the entire front pocket sleeve is lined with a long velcro strip that need two hands to open it would have been better just to put a button there for <unk> ease but to get something out of the front , you have to literally pull the cover open and everytime it lets out a loud , <unk> and then , for the main compartment , there 's another velcro flap that always gets in the way everytime you zip the bag closed velcro really killed this briefcase for me like i said , there are better out there go with those instead
padding <unk> accessible areas <unk> for pens , id , mp # player check check <unk> have nothing negative to say about this case except , i should have purchased # this case allows for me to carry my laptop , laptop cooler -lrb- ultra-thin cooler -rrb- , and a portable hard drive it does get a tad heavy but the handle is very comfortable and with the added strap across my shoulder , makes carry my computer a breeze the case itself is coated in this shinny materials , think of a water proof coat
i got this bag primarily for airplane traveling and it is perfect for the job i can zip it through airport security without having to remove my laptop the bag has a slim profile while still providing ample space for things it 's an ideal carry-on there is plenty of room for other items to keep you busy on flights , and everything remains tidy of course , it 's equally good as an every-day , computer bag as well it has nice tidy paper storing areas to keep organized for meetings or conferences this is my second targus computer bag and they continue to satisfy me my other targus is a backpack style computer bag which went through college with me and shows no ill signs of wear these are great bags , i recommend them
this laptop case was purchased for my son-in-law as a christmas gift he has a very casual case and needed one that looked more professional to bring to meetings , etc . he was very please with it i thought it looked as though i had paid a lot more for it than i did , so i was pleased also one more thing -- the case is advertised for a # . # `` laptop , but it will actually fit up to a # `` laptop according to the packaging information so if you have a little bigger laptop , but not a # `` , it will fit perfectly hope this helps
this case is a perfect fit for my asus # . # inch laptop it meets the requirements as posted by on -lsb- ... -rsb- it seems surprising sturdy for the price it has a pocket that is fine for the charger and another that will handle the mouse the laptop pocket seems secure enough with just the velcro seal , but it also has a wide strap -lrb- with velcro -rrb- to give additional security there are two places to insert business cards , should it ever be lost , so it may be returned there is an outside full size compartment to hold papers , magazines , etc . all in all it far exceeds my expectations , and it is quite attractive it wo n't please everyone , but should satisfy most
i had trouble finding a case and found this one , which fits every need i wanted a cheap security friendly case for the few times i travel i was concerned about my laptop fitting -lrb- this advertises # . # and mine is a # -rrb- but it fits like a glove
the item arrived within good time , and was well packaged the vga pin side was protected by a plastic cover which easily slid off in preparation for use the product appeared intact with no visible sign of wear and tear unfortunately , when tested on multiple computers , it did not work properly a picture appeared on the desired monitor , but not a clear one by any means it was black and white with lines running throughout , making any sort of possibility of <unk> the picture <unk> at best i reported this to the seller , and within two to three days i received a full refund -lrb- # plus # . # shipping and handling -rrb- i wish the product had worked , but i am impressed with the <unk> of the seller , `` <unk> ``
i did not know that this adapter will not work because you can not go from vga to rca without a converter i am sending it back , i had to get a converter and this adapter is useless
does not work do n't waste your money on this product , there is no physical way for this to work i am a professional <unk> dj and no such thing has ever worked for me there is no & # # ; cheap solution & # # ; you will need a pc to tv converter -lrb- vga to rca -rrb- only $ #
got it within a few days , everything looked right , but when i <unk> to test it out none of my products recognized it , or even thought it was there do not buy this product
read the description first before u buy . . i <unk> thought u could just plug in and use but it dosent work like that yr tower must have video out card or some s *** like
i guess its theoretically possible to get this to work with a vga output with tv out whatever , just make sure you have this incredibly unique vga output before buying
i bought this thinking i could use it to connect my windows # laptop to a tv -lrb- i did n't read the other reviews carefully enough . it does n't work because it 's not a converter monoprice gave me a refund , so i think they 're a good company -lrb- thus , the # stars , rather than # star . make sure your pc can output <unk> video via your vga connector , otherwise you need a converter like i do
it did n't do what i needed it to do i 'm willing to admit it might be my fault for expecting too much from it but but two stars means i do n't like it which i do n't
you need to buy the cheap apple adapter for # bucks to convert video . this only <unk> with video cards that have built in composite out and i think even the apple adaptor is meant for the apple video card
this was ordered for use to adapt computer video output to a video display however the video output of the computer was n't compatible with the display more research is needed for this project too small a car for a net-book on the dash
this is a pretty cheap vga to rca or <unk> , but <unk> only work on video cards that are able to support <unk> , which <unk> a lot of <unk> video
! ! ! this is not a converter ! ! this adapter will not convert a digital signal to <unk> this is used as an adapter for video cards that already have that capability it is , for all intent , a replacement part i purchased this one and it works perfectly if you want to connect the vga output from a computer to an <unk> tv you will need a converter try searching for `` <unk> box `` and you should several of them
love it ! be careful if you have little kids my daughter pulled the cord -lrb- which i often dont <unk> up -rrb- and the whole thing came crashing down and dented my macbook air otherwise its nice and soft , and fits like a glove with the speck case hardcover its a snug fit
awesome product ! ! ! great quality material good price compared to other sites , but overall kind of expensive for type of item it is unique though , and my boyfriend loves it , and people <unk> it all the time for the fake envelope :
# inch macbook air fits inside perfectly good padding and closes securely with both velcro and the red string wrap i have recommended this to friends with the same computer
i bought this as a gift for an apple fan it was perfect -- he loved it it looks just like the manila envelope steve jobs used to introduce the air however , it 's made for the <unk> user the leather is very high quality -- plus , there is enough padding to protect your investment
a must have for you who have the macbook air it 's a head turner has a nice fluffy inside so your laptop can rest `` comfy `` inside and do n't scratch i love it
just picked this up the other day for my samsung netbook and this fits perfectly the sleeve is made very well and the memory foam appears to be an excellent solution for any potential knocks your computer may take i did some research before buying this model and i have no regrets after choosing this one
this case fits my acer aspire one # . # inch perfectly it feels and snug and very secure the memory foam is great and gives my laptop more than enough protection i just wish it had a strap so i could hang it over my shoulder but other than that , it 's perfect
after many research there were not too many sleeves that could fit a netbook with a # cell battery i was skeptic about buying this sleeve ; however , this sleeve was the only one that offered a cool design and good support for the netbook the dimension seems to be a little bit bigger than my netbook but it all fit perfectly well , its not too tight and not too loose , there is probably half of an inch of unused space i believed based on the color choice you choose , the sleeve dimension are slightly different , the black/white i purchased was the only one that offered more length and i am happy about my choice , no regret the material is nice , simple and stylish at the same time , and does n't have a strong smell like one that i ordered and returned back
bought this for an eee netbook and it fits it perfectly very comfortable and light there is no space however for any cords or gadgets so keep them in your carry on
it is a great fit and much higher quality than i expected overall , it is a # star purchase and i would recommend it to anyone who is needing a netbook sleeve =
a wonderful sleeve the zipper is solid , easy to use even with the netbook in the sleeve , there still is room to slip in a few other thin items i put our passports and extra <unk> cards in with the netbook when placing everything in the hotel safe during trips to avoid leaving something behind a great product
this briefcase is just right first it is leather and not that <unk> canvas then it is compact yet roomy enough to hold all the things i need in addition to my laptop such as -lrb- files , charger , camera , cords etc . .
we needed a padded briefcase for taking our laptop on vacation and this certainly fills the bill it 's surface is easy to wipe off and it has a large front pouch for holding cables and power supply cords and <unk> it has an nice carry strap as well and we foresee getting good use for this case which is sized for our # . # inch laptop it is not expensive looking or showy , but is practical for family use
i nice bag for the price i used it about twice a week for about a year before it began showing significant wear i will replace it with a more up scale briefcase now that the seams are tearing and the material around the handle has worn through to the padding underneath i think this wear is because i overstuffed it with heavy and bulky accessories
i got this bag to give as a gift but was so impressed by its look and quality that decided to keep it for myself the quality of the bag is very nice and it looks stylish as well also i m able to fit in all my laptop accessories as well which is a bonus
this bag looks exactly like the bag my school district has purchased for the laptops provided to the teachers it looks and feels like quality material i like the pocket storage space i would recommend purchasing this bag for your laptop
it is well-made and looks more expensive than it is interior pockets are great for organizing shoulder strap and handle both appear to be sufficient to handle computer , cords , notebook and one textbook without a problem
we have had this a few months , use it often , and it hardly shows wear we had real leather bags that looked real bad in # months , ripping apart and handles cracking . but this still looks like new it 's well worth the price whenever this does wear out , i will get another of this exact one
nice looking , a quality feeling product for the price i 've spent over a $ # on other cases that fell apart in no time at all this is doing quite nicely
i have had this case a little over a year and it suddenly <unk> with both zippers failing within a week of <unk> when paying a premium for a case , the durability should be better -lrb- i have only put it in my backpack and have not excessively challenged the case
`` durable sleeve with a slick , rugged exterior - yes `` perfectly fitted for the new unibody macbook pro `` - <unk> on past <unk> owned where there was no movement the laptop now moves when enclosed
i read a few reviews regarding this product being a bit to big for the new unibody macbook pro i decided to take the chance and it paid off this case does everything it 's supposed to and has a snug fit i have n't noticed any moving of the notebook what so ever hard fabric shell exterior with a pelican <unk> foam interior , you ca n't go wrong needless to say i 'm thoroughly pleased with my purchase i also highly recommend for the price you just ca n't beat the quality of protection
fits the # inch macbook pro and protects it extremely well i 'd love to see some closed cell foam in there , but honestly , it still protects extremely well definitely the best sleeve i 've found for the mb pro #
this is one of the few sleeves i could find for my macbook that offered some stiffness i wanted something that i could throw into a crowded backpack during international travel , something that could take a knocking from hard objects this sleeve has a stiff , molded nylon cover , and the interior is <unk> padded with <unk> cushioning it fits my # -inch macbook snugly , and the zipper has good , <unk> pulls that operate smoothly i felt confident <unk> my laptop to significant abuse with this case , confident that knocks would be absorbed and distributed without resulting in a dent to the macbook 's aluminum
if you are serious about protecting your mac , i 'd recommend getting one of these this product works as intended the shell is hard with a soft <unk> foam on the inside the zipper is heavy duty - which is a plus the only drawback is that there is no handle or arm sling attached to the case i place this case inside of a computer travel bag for transport
this `` skin `` fits perfectly i like that it 's not bulky it has re-enforced ridges sewn on the top and bottom which create some extra protection for the laptop flat surfaces without adding to the bulk i appreciate it 's simple <unk> design
this is a fantastic sleeve for the macbook pro # `` the design is worth of the laptop it protects and it fits beautifully i fear this item might be discontinued since it is not available on the booq website bring it back
i shopped for cases for weeks finally deciding on this for a variety of reasons the sleeve fits perfectly , with zipper protection so it does n't damage my pretty little mbp the <unk> stiffen the case so it is easier to insert into the sleeve -lrb- sleeves without this feature are basically thick bags that flop around when trying to work with them the zipper goes around the top and the side this was unexpected and i love the option to just zip the `` top `` - the long side , or the `` side `` - the short side not to mention it 's great look
this sleeve for the macbook pro # `` is pretty much perfection i bought it two years ago for my # `` # model i just upgraded to the # model and it fits perfectly on both of them it 's a great sleeve , slick looking and totally unobtrusive my only question is why does it cost more here on amazon than it does on the actual booq website go there , to get it cheaper
perfect fit and quality construction make this the best sleeve for a macbook pro oh , and it looks great too i set my mbp on top of the sleeve and use it as a <unk> ; it keeps the bottom of my system clean and does n't obstruct the air exhaust port also , unlike other sleeves , the inside of the zipper on the booq <unk> skin m never touches the laptop -lrb- read : wo n't scratch the system .
for the price of the netbook its really decent . it doesnt have a lot of padding if u want protection for a case , i suggest you get a incase i have one for my macbook . it is very expensive , thats the main reason why i didnt get it for my mac this case should last : d so , if you want to just have a case to carry around , this is one of them you should get
i used this case for my asus eee pc netbook , and it 's still working well after # months i brought my netbook abroad with me , and traveled daily , and this case kept my netbook safe it works very well , is easy to open and close , and includes a zipper pouch in the front there is also a flap you can place more tightly around the computer , to keep it even more safe however , some of the stitching came a bit loose on this part , but it is still functional , i just treat it with care great product overall
i 've had this a little over a year now , love it , took it on a trip and it 's held up just great durable , easy access and it made very well , i recommend this to others looking
this laptop sleeve is the perfect size for my # -inch netbook i love the extra zipper compartment ; i use it to carry my adapter there are also a few small compartments inside the color is great too
the case is very useful but i ordered the blue case & when i opened the package they had sent me a black case thus i was n't as pleased as i could 've been with this purchase i was on a limited time schedule , -lrb- did not have time to wait on a return process -rrb- thus i had to settle for what i got -lrb- black rather than blue -rrb- good luck with their getting the right color as my luck was n't so great on this purchase
nice little case ; with a little push i can fit it in while the # <unk> battery is attached , although an extra # inch of space would have been nice that being said , if you are looking for a royal blue case , this is n't it while it looks royal blue in the picture , it 's actually a very dark navy blue as a previous reviewer said , it could be easily mistaken for black frankly , i already have a black case ; i had wanted something a little less <unk>
i bought this to provide better protection to my ipad # , which has a snug leather case on it the cube case is firm but flexible and provides some air room to stop the glass from getting squished in my luggage there is a velcro strap to stop it from falling . out when you open it the big problem is the smell of chemicals when it first arrived i have been airing it out in the garage for # weeks just to make it bearable i can only hope that the poor chinese workers manufacturing these are provided breathing protection i have a very similar case purchased a few years ago that did not have this issue
the case is nice but it 's not deep enough to carry your cables the only thing you can put in the case is your laptop and maybe some thin wires a wall charger will not fit i would recommend getting a # x # to carry every thing
i have a small netbook that should fit very easily into this case instead , i have to fight with the case every time i want to close it my problem is that the two halves do n't line up once the netbook is inside i can get it zippered but not without patience and some <unk> there is no give to the item and the dimensions are pretty <unk> when i travel , i have taken to putting the ` book inside this case and then putting the case inside the laptop pocket of my backpack the case is small and lightweight but i do n't see it providing much in the way of impact protection yes , it 'll keep your gloss finish from being scratched in the event of a drop but it wo n't protect against damage to the internal components truly , the manufacturer should add more padding and a bit more fabric to this case - not all laptops are built the same
the case seems to be made well enough it 's just not quite large enough to fit the netbook and its power cord and mouse the netbook wo n't fit in it without taking the battery off
i purchased the kroo cube # `` laptop bag the bag is cute and designed to protect the bag , my notebook fits perfectly the only downfall for me is that their is not enough space in the bag to carry charger and wireless mouse other than that the bag is great
i bought two of these kroo cases , one in blue and another <unk> they were priced very reasonable and looked to be just what was needed to give with the <unk> inspiron mini # . # -inch <unk> had recently purchased upon opening them i was happy with the size , construction and look of them the blue is much darker than pictured here in darker lighting i actually had trouble telling it apart from the black case inside it has a strap to secure the netbook , small sleeves for media cards and a side pocket for your power cord , usb mouse , etc . if you are looking for a case that can store more than what i have mentioned , you probably need to keep looking this was more than sufficient storage for our needs , but for anything more you 'll need to go bigger
this case is much better than getting a sleeve for my asus # `` eeepc netbook feels like my netbook is totally protected handles fold flat nicely i read in other reviews that this case has room for accessories but i am unable to put anything aside from my mousepad in the case and have it comfortably close its ok because i carry it in my backpack
for the price this is a great purchase i bought to fit my child 's nabi # , which it does quite well my child loves the blue cover and it protects quite well there is enough room for a little extra storage , but we have n't actually used it in this way we 're just glad to have an inexpensive alternative for the outrageous cost of an actual nabi # case
use it to haul a netbook around in a big bag with other work stuff . durable . not as `` solid `` as i would have liked though . fits a netbook perfectly , no room to spare
this is a very nice case it 's hard and has a pocket on the inside there is extra room as well i bought it to fit my child 's nabi and it works great
this case is great it 's hard and inside has a velcro strap to hold the <unk> a pocket to hold your important things , like manuals and i have all my <unk> <unk> and <unk>
this is a very good bag i finally retired my old style brief case this one is much lighter all i ever really carry around any more is my laptop , plus a few cords and cables , and this is more than enough for that less to lug around you do n't realize how much weight you are carrying until you have back pain after a long week also this bag is slightly cushioned to prevent accidental breakage it 's not super padded , but just enough for every day use if you have a fairly strong laptop
this case is perfect for dell netbook mini # it is attractive -lrb- looks better than amazon pic -rrb- , sturdy , holds cord and usb flash drives really well the netbook is not too tight or too loose and the case offers <unk> protection the zipper is well made and not one of those difficult to zip or easy to break
this little hard case is just prefect for the computer , it will carry the power cord and sd cards and if you have a slim cd/dvd drive , it can fit as well , if well organized
i bought this for my dell mini # and have loved it i can fit everything i need into it it is a great carrying case and offers great protection for my mini
bought this for my # year old son to go with his new netbook from santa it 's perfect very durable , easy to open , carry and clean great protection for his computer and he loves it
i had had a soft sleeve from another company and was expecting the same this is hard , like hard styrofoam and i do n't like the way it feels or fits my mbp
the material is stiff and unpleasant to touch despite being stiff , the material is not thick and i am sure it can not provide much protection if dropped the quality of the zipper and seams is cheap and not durable i recommend avoiding this manufacturer entirely
