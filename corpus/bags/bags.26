this bag is amazing i beat the hell out of my first one by taking it all over the <unk> on more airplanes than i can possibly keep track of i 've shoved up to # laptops at a time into it , so after # years of abuse , i finally got rid of my old one and picked this one up could n't be more satisfied
a little on the big side for carry on , but this case is tough and holds a lot of stuff i have had # before of this case and eventually the screws in the handle will need to be tighten
great case for the money zippers are the best on the market not sure about durability of pull out handle , seems a little flimsy , but will see as time goes so far so good i work on computers and this tote will hold everything i need to do the job the layout is excellent and i use the laptop case to carry a laptop with me wherever i go
i just love this case - i work remotely quite a bit and am able to transport my laptop , paperwork , files , and even my <unk> gear in this case a lot of thought went into this case , as there are several compartments to accommodate all your needs i even carry my running shoes in this case and still have room to spare its very sturdy with heavy duty zippers to ensure no gaps or breakage . i bought a rolling garment bag from wenger about # years ago , and its still going strong looking for another rolling garment bag for my husband , but it appears its been discontinued i would like to see more color options in this case - maybe a blue or green ,
i can not say enough about this product , it has surprised me in many ways of the storage capabilities , along with all of the other great features it has only negative thing i can say in my opinion is the handle , which can be pain to get up and down at times along with a weakness feel i have paid more for others that did n't even last
my husband had been looking for a wheeled bag that would accomodate his computer but also serve as a travel bag for his long distance business trips this would have cost hundreds of dollars with all the options in another bag it is sturdy , compact , and <unk> wheels are smooth rolling and the handle is stable what more can i say it goes through airport security without question
it is perfect set up for everything you need to do on the road for business fits legal files ! ! ! laptop and more it functions like a traveling office i work on the road a lot it is perfect
the product is <unk> the way it shows on the picture and the quality of the product is great now i can travel without having to carry a backpack with my stuffs ... thank
this holds a lot of stuff it has five compartments i have it attached to a stronger luggage carrier , as i have so much stuff in it for work , that i did <unk> the handle would stand up to the strain
this is a great bag i love that is has a smaller bag that you can take with you when you do not need to take the entire rolling brief case it has a lot of room for just about everything an <unk> or <unk> would need to meet with clients at their office if you decide , you can leave the smaller bag out of the larger one to make more room for travel i am very happy with this seller they shipped my product right away and it got here in two days they are awesome i will purchase from them again and i would recommend to a friend
bought this for someone as a christmas gift and he loves it ! fantastic quality and tons of room looks great , feels great and it does not fall over like a lot of the other cases did great job wenger
you could n't believe what i can pack in this case you can get # or # days clothes plus a laptop and scanner plus files and it has been everywhere this last year and is holding up great this is one sturdy suitcase update mar # , # , i am still using this case and it is still holding up just fine i have had no wheel or zipper problems
i love these cases i travel a lot i pack this thing full , & it always fits in the overhead compartment , even on small planes i just have to pull the laptop -lrb- which has its own case inside -rrb- out sometimes very high quality , & room for everything i need it even has a place to hang my car keys when i am flying out
a coworker had this case and i went looking for it at office depot it was the best case i could find , but amazon was selling it for $ # less it does n't have as many little pockets inside for holding smaller items , pens , etc . , but i made it work i enjoy not having a backpack on my back anymore i 've also used this case as a kind of cart for boxes and it worked well this is the # rd laptop bag/case i 've had from swiss <unk> and i 've yet to be disappointed with them so far
this is a great bag with tons of space if you fly a lot you may want to consider one a bit smaller as it barely fits under a plane seat
it looks good wheels are smooth and quiet handle works well zippers are sturdy i like the interior laptop bag so i do n't have to take the whole rolling bag into a meeting when traveling holds a good amount of material , but not enough space to pack clothing if you are taking <unk> i have only had the bag for a few weeks , but so far i am very pleased with the purchase
my previous patriot wore out at the handle i noticed that they had completely refurbished the handle design on this model and i really like it great product and fantastic for business travel see a lot of them too hard to find in the store , so that is what amazon is for
this is exactly what my husband was looking for to commute to work with -lrb- by train -rrb- the picture gives a good description of what you can place in each section the smaller bag that comes with it can be attached on the pole on top of the bag due to the strap on the back , plus the smaller bag has a strap that comes with it we are hoping this will make his trip a little easier aside from wearing a bag on his shoulders after a few months of use we will update if we have concerns to share
if you are a techy who needs to haul a laptop , mini network switch , cables , and attachments along with files and some tools , this is the case for you it has seperate little pouches for id cards , thumb drives , hearing buds , etc . the wenger patriot rolling case meets all my needs plus some i did n't know i had the wheels are smooth and roll over gravel and grass as well as cement solid sturdy and well made
good zipper quality . is not perfect size for my asus g # sx laptop , one inch is not enough to fix perfectly all other , a lot of space for all my electronic accesories , big folders with documents , and some space for clothes
i bought this bag to carry around my laptop and textbooks , and i have really enjoyed using it there is plenty of space in the pockets for a variety of items i am usually able to get # or # textbooks in the middle section , and the back section fits my # & # # ; laptop easily the handle is pretty sturdy and has withstood a lot of abuse so far i would definitely recommend this for anyone looking for a durable , spacious rolling bag
this bag is great it is versatile and <unk> as a business traveler , my lap top bag is my office with the wegner patriot i am able to have everything i need in this one bag it is a little deep -lrb- front to back -rrb- , so it wo n't fit in the overheads in some of the smaller commuter planes it overall for me i give it two thumbs up
had this for about a month now lots of storage room i use it for school to carry my laptop , books , folders , etc . i was a bit concerned about the handle since some people have had problems with it , but not for me so far
the wenger patriot rolling case exceeded my expectations with excellent storage capacity my business travel requires transporting notebooks , forms , computers etc . i was apprehensive as to whether the case would hold my large laptop -lrb- dell latitude d # -rrb- and still leave room for other gear the case stores the computer with no issues and offers plenty of other space the case has held up to some rugged conditions and is breeze to roll across airport parking lots
this is my second wenger rolling case , same kind , that i bought the first one last about # years i definitively recommend others to buy it : it has enough space to store some cloths , your laptop and some office staff if you are a regular business or executive traveler for a short time trips -lrb- say # days -rrb- , you might have it
this is the second wenger cases i 've owned my wife `` stole `` the first one from me , which i 've owned for over two years ; so i needed a replacement i considered the first wenger computer case to be an excellent product with absolutely no issues regarding quality this new case seems to be just as well made and i 'm completely satisified
this is my second patriot bag - first one developed a problem with the telescoping handle design has been changed on this one so we 'll see if it holds up better overall bag is great - large enough for overnight but i also use it on a daily basis - large capacity separate computer briefcase is great for quick <unk> wheels ar <unk> rolling and
loved this item rolls very smoothly and has plenty of storage capabilities my only bummer about it was that i saw it at sam 's club for $ # cheaper then what i had purchased it for on amazon
i travel a lot and this is my third roller bag and the second one from wenger i had my last wenger bag for about eight years i wore the wheels out on it and then the bag itself it had been wheeled for who know how many miles and shoved under hundreds of airline seats the main part of the bag was still in great shape and wears like steel the new bag has better wheels which is a huge improvement i will probably never have to buy a roller bag again since the wenger bag lasts so long and now the wheels will last longer too one of the best products i have ever purchased i give it a <unk> + + + + + + +
can fit everything in this case - clothes , laptop , books , and <unk> only thing i did n't care for was the thickness after i got everything in it , a little
the rolling case was delivered on time and nicely packaged the bag is less priced than the retail stores the case is brand new and just perfect for a # days business trip easily fits in the cabin
there 's a reason that you see so many of these cases while travelling ... it 's wonderfully accessable and moves so easily . it 's really impressive of just how much it can hold and expand
i work with multiple companies as a rep got tired of changing briefcases from one logo 'd bag to another when going to different meetings and shows researched the wenger patriot and decided it would be a great travel bag for my needs it is my first wheeled briefcase , and especially in airports has proven very convenient fits wonderfully in overhead bins on planes , and very functional at the security <unk> easily handles my # `` laptop in main compartment , velcro straps in place with plenty of extra space well constructed , true specs , and very durable to date i read that some people were upset about inner bag not fitting larger laptops , but when opening product it stated inner bag will only fit a # . # `` besides , the inner bag makes a nice <unk> tote for <unk> when you do n't really need <unk> else this is my new portable office , and i would highly recommend
it 's a great bag for holding a -lrb- d -rrb- slr camera , a few lens , camcorder , and # in laptop my only complaint is that the straps are a little awkward to connect and during long periods of use , it gets uncomfortable on my shoulders although i do n't regret purchasing the bag for it 's space , but i would n't purchase it again
be sure you really need a camera bag this big before you buy it if you stuff all the compartments with gear , it is heavy to pack for extended periods try it on first it will however , hold everything you need for photographic excursions the quality is truly apparent in this product and i feel confident it will protect the camera and its gear a good number of storage compartments with quality zippers and fasteners
this is one of the very few tsa approved laptop bags that allow you pass airport security quickly you just open a zipper and the bag flaps open with one part holding the laptop only and the other part holding whatever you put in the other compartments it 's easy to handle and saves indeed some hassle at the airport the downside of this bag is its <unk> space use it 's a very large backpack -lrb- # x # x # . # inches -rrb- and <unk> unnecessarily ample space -lrb- about # x # . # x # . # inches -rrb- for the laptop compartment you are not allowed , however , to put anything else there , so a lot of space is lost that 's a pity because mobileedge could have designed the laptop compartment much slimmer which would have left more space for books , paper etc . i also miss a strap at each side that support the zipper when your backpack is really stuffed
it 's as advertised and i generally agree with the other reviews , however i do n't think the bag was field tested for actually fitting well under the seat in front of you it 's also a bit heavy if you have a really big laptop and carry a lot extra 's with you and and can store it in an overhead - it 'll be fine otherwise , much it will be empty space and you 'll be hard pressed to get under the seat -lrb- and you can forget about what little leg room remains -rrb- for my needs , i need something more compact as i have a # `` x # `` lenovo -lrb- bag is ~ # `` x # `` -rrb- and limited accouterments
i frequently travel and was looking for a back pack laptop bag that allowed me to go through the security checkpoint without taking my laptop out this bag is great for that but not for anything else pros : quick to process through security checkpoint great straps and back support cons : too tall for a # `` and under laptop compartments are all stacked on top and front of each other some compartments are too narrow and deep i wish this bag came in a much smaller size the zippers should go further down when opening i will be checking to see if they make any improvement on this bag in the future
i was surprised at how tall this backpack is i measured that it was # `` from bottom to top , which is longer than the product specs i read it seems to be made for over-sized laptops
the laptop pocket and zipper mechanisms makes tsa screening a breeze , at least as far as dealing with the computer the dual pockets on the front do n't suit me as well as the single larger pocket on my previous computer backpack ; it 's hard to find a good place to put the a/c charger brick in this backpack comfort while wearing is generally good , though the length of the backpack seems sized for someone a few inches taller than i am -lrb- # ' # `` -rrb- there are some pads on the outside which rest on your back as you wear it -- a nice innovation
i 've only had the pack about a month and have been to two countries on a <unk> schedule i am very pleased with the mobile edge backpack i especially like the laptop feature because all i have to do is put it on the table and unzip it all of the other items -lrb- there are many -rrb- flip to the other side and the whole thing goes through the scanner easily it also had a large label that tells the tsa agents that it approved so that stops unnecessary searches it is also much easier to put on and take off than my previous pack there are multiple pockets and the pack has so much storage space that i is difficult to find items at times the small , inside , pockets are handy for small items i expect to use this item for many
this laptop backpack has lots of pockets for all of the accessories that must travel with a computer -lrb- power cords , mouse , etc . -rrb- the bag itself is a little larger than i would have expected but it does have to fit my # `` laptop it is well padded it lays flat for being x-rayed with the use of a single zipper i would recommend this bag
i fly approximately once a week and am very happy with this pack , as it does everything it is advertised to do i have received several comments from tsa employees about the `` checkpoint friendly `` markings additionally , i have received several <unk> from other travelers when i did n't have to remove my laptop during screening the laptop compartment must have been designed to fit the largest computer on the market , as it completely swallows my dell inspiron <unk> , the extra space in the non-laptop side has allowed me to carry my extra clothes and toiletries for an overnight trip however , most of the time the bag is larger than needed for my laptop , accessories , kindle , etc . and thus the four stars instead of five
this is a great laptop bag which holds my # `` laptop with plenty of room to spare i love the little pockets for sd cards and the like also a couple of pockets for thumb drives not really an `` overnight bag `` for your <unk> as it 's not got any large compartments for such however , it 's a very good bag for your computer & all the peripherals looks well constructed and feels comfortable on my back i 've had other tsa approved laptop bags and they are very helpful in the airport security lines it 's so nice to just unzip and leave your laptop in the bag so far i give the bag a b + rating will update when i 've had the bag for a while
i have yet to use it on a flight , but it served me well for some overnight road trips plenty of pockets and space for my # `` dell , extra battery and accoutrements well padded and comfortable as a backpack
the back pack has turned out to be much better than i thought i originally thought it would not be large enough for everything out of my old back pack , i was wrong ... room to spare i travel almost every week and it is a pleasure not having to take the computer out only watch out is if you travel to japan they still want the computer out of the bag
i bought this for my asus # he suggest to the manufacturer to add an inch to their product size also make the side pocket expand more to accommodate the power supply and mouse if all you need is to lug your netbook only and not bring along accessories , this bag is for you
the new toshiba nb # is a great # `` netbook , but with its extended battery life and extended battery size , this bag is just a little too tight i will still keep it , hoping it will expand slightly with use if it were n't for the fit , i would give it # stars for it 's design and protective padding
i got <unk> for carrying this bag around . it looked too much like a purse it fit my sony viao p and power adapter perfectly , but i could have done without the <unk> at work something to think about before buying , guys
<unk> bag is great for my acer # . # inch netbook it also has extra pockets for miscellaneous stuff like my usb mouse and sd card it can carried on my shoulder or in my hand <unk> of the larger battery for the <unk> one , it is a tight fit
i bought this case for my acer aspire one and it works perfectly i have no problem fitting everything in the case , even with the larger battery on the back of my acer i fit my mini mouse or power cords in the front pocket , and although it does bulge out in the front , i am still able to close it i can also fit one of these items in the inner pocket without a problem of course it would be nice if there was a little more room for these things so that it did n't stick out so much , but this bag really is the best fit i 've found so far this really is a simple , straightforward , easy to use case that looks stylish and has two different types of handles , which i really appreciate i did a lot of research before i bought this because i wanted to make sure that it would fit my needs without being too pricey , which many of the nicer netbook bags are this one was a good deal and i am very satisfied with my choice
i purchased this bag for my acer aspire one and have not been disappointed the computer fits well and i have room for my mouse and power supply this is a well made bag and should last a long time my only dislike is the magnetic catch for the outside pouch will not close with the power supply inside i would recomend this for anyone who needs a bag for their one
i bought this bag for my msi wind netbook the computer fits perfectly and the inside pocket holds my wireless mouse and usb thumbdrive the power cord fits fine in the outside pocket my only complain is that the inside pocket and the outside pocket are on opposite sides , so there is no way to lay the bag flat when both pockets are filled with bulky objects otherwise i love this bag it is very comfortable to carry and compact
i got this for my new dell inspiron mini fits the computer perfect there are two small inner pockets - perfect for flash drives and stuff and one larger outer pocket only wish it had a bigger outside pocket with a flap - would like to put my wallet in there so i do n't have to carry a purse as well otherwise , nice product , well made and easy to use
this is the best netbook case i 've found most of the other products in this category seem to forget the inevitable <unk> of accessories and junk that accompany a laptop this has a large front pocket and several internal pockets , and holds my # he , its power brick , a bluetooth mouse , and a usb cell modem nothing else i 've seen has enough space the build quality feels solid its fabric is lightweight by feels very strong , and the hardware feels like it could hold something that weighed # times as much my only complaint is the magnetic closure on the outside pockets magnets have n't been a major problem to hard drives in years , but i still make sure my netbook 's hard drive faces away from the front
this netbook case is a perfect fit for the <unk> # `` + power block the outside pocket accomodates a cable & lock , a small laser pointer , a small solar calculator , a # `` square earbud case the quality seems excellent it has carrying strap handles and a comfortable shoulder strap it is adequately padded for the mini # with its ssd rather than a hdd i 'm very happy with this purchase
this is a great case for my hp # netbook well padded with ample room for my netbook mouse and bluetooth headphones exterior fabric looks and feels durable very comfortable slung over the shoulder would have preferred leather but extensive searching found no such product i guess netbooks will have to have a greater market <unk> before a leather version appears
caselogic <unk> # is uniquely made for # `` netbooks , like the samsung nc # it is slim , well made , and highly attractive room to hold a couple of mice and other accessories , but not quite big enough to handle the power brick and associated cords it is dramatically smaller than a standard laptop case and is thus much more likely to be taken along the whole package is both small and light-weight -lrb- around # lbs -rrb- of all the various cases i own , this is my <unk> favorite if you check the case logic web site , they have two other similar cases , each one progressively thicker these would allow taking along lots of accessories
i have a # `` and a # `` asus netbook and looked a long time for the perfect carrying case for the # `` the # `` has a much smaller case and will fit in a jacket pocket , but the # `` will not i tried sleeves , but they will not fit anything other than the computer on the <unk> , the caselogic will carry a small mouse and the charger comfortably it is very well thought out and for my money the best case for this size computer
this item is solid , well made and fits the acer aspire one just right probably want a <unk> to make the fit easy it was what i was looking for
i bought this bag for a # `` <unk> <unk> it works great and feels padded enough to prevent breakage of the ereader if you drop it -lrb- on a rug for sure -rrb- i highly recommend this item if you have a # `` ereader or laptop it will protect your investment
i was tired of lugging my old # `` lap top around on trips , so i bought an hp mini # this great little netbook needed a compact case to carry it around in the caselogic # is perfect it comfortably holds the # `` screen mini , and the little outside pocket is just big enough to hold the power supply the only negative might be the magnetic clasp for the outer pouch in a perfect world it would have a better closure the case appears very well constructed of tough material , its adequately padded , has hand grips and an adjustable shoulder strap
the sleeve is very durable and definitely protects my precious netbook my only complaint is that the exterior pocket is a bit too small for my netbook 's charger even so , i manage to fit it in along with three usb flash drives without a doubt , a great product ... and i always love case logic as a brand
got this after seeing some reviews as others have mentioned the pocket is a little cramped if you want to take your power supply with you and it will most certainly not carry another battery i have managed to jam my s # power supply in the pocket , but it makes it look a little bulky and silly if you want to take along a memory stick or really small notebook mouse i may be alright as a pure netbook sleeve , it looks great and does its job ca n't really ask for too much more
i have and acer aspire one # . # with the extra capacity battery and the machine just barely fits in this sleeve the little pocket is good for cables but not the power adapter but with the # hour battery i usually leave the power cable at home
this is an excellent carrying case for your # to # inch netbook made of neoprene to protect it from shocks and has a handy pocket to carry <unk> i like it very much especially the color
*** update # *** having gone through two hp mini # s to a fried mobo and a <unk> virus , this case has held up great it now houses my eee pc # p just as well as it did the <unk> *** original review *** this case fits the hp mini # quite well - there is about # of an inch of extra room at the top with the laptop inside , other than that it fits great the pocket is stretchy which allows you to put the <unk> charger for the mini inside it bulges out a bit , but it all fits easy to use and good function protects well from minor dings and scratches - i would n't expect it to protect from a drop of > # feet though , since there is no solid reinforcements around the edges
i was expecting one more separate compartment for the computer i still need to use a sleeve also to keep the computer 's case from getting scratched by other items stored in the same compartment the zipper pouch on the front is for small accessories -lrb- thumb drive , small mouse -rrb- while the velcro part on the back could be used for the power supply all other items , computer included , are stored in the main center compartment the strap also seems connected oddly , it almost appears twisted i am using it to store an eeepc # ha with mouse , power supply , and misc small items
this is a great case but it does not fit the samsung nc # netbook which was the reason i purchased it it may fit other # inch netbooks and would certainly fit # inch netbooks it is very well organised and it is made very well if it was half an inch bigger it would have been perfect for my nc # and i would have gladly kept it
i was looking for a bag which would protect my acer aspire and also carry the other items i would need on a trip back east -lrb- charger , mouse , etc . and pens , paper , <unk> -rrb- this <unk> little bag is perfect for my and the acer 's needs it was the best choice according to the descriptions i read i am happy to say that the descriptions are accurate and my acer aspire netbook will travel in style and comfort in this bag
if you do n't already own a dell mini # you should it 's a great machine this bag is fine , but it really was n't designed specifically for the mini # there are straps inside but they do nothing to secure the computer like any good laptop bag should be sure to place the bag on a table first before opening , and check to make sure it 's zipped up before lifting my other complaint is that it was almost real work to shove the power cord into the accessory pocket it does fit but barely . and i do suggest opening the bag 's plastic packaging in an <unk> environment the artificial leather does give off some fumes on the initial open overall the bag is not perfect but does fit the mini # and its power cord for a reasonable price
they do n't really make a carrying case for mini # the way i really want i checked every other ones and find out this is better then <unk> cases it fits perfect for my mini , and it has enough room for charger and wireless mouse but why not the shoulder straps it makes me feel like carrying a purse
this case fits the dell # `` mini perfectly it 's really well thought out in almost every detail : all the ports are accessible on both sides when the case is unzipped , so the netbook is fully usable while still in the case there are # straps that hold the netbook in the case , and the # that grip the screen are clear , so no part of the screen is obscured it 's nicely padded , just the right size , and adds very little weight to the mini the outside compartment has just barely enough room for the ac adaptor and a mouse -lrb- with a bit of a bulge -rrb- , and maybe a usb stick or two about the only flaw i could find is that there are no loops on the outside where one could attach a neck strap the only way of carrying it is by the handles at the top , like a tiny briefcase -lrb- a friend asked me , with raised <unk> , `` is that a handbag you 're carrying ? so guys , if you 're not confident in your <unk> , you might want to think twice about this case . i think it is a terrific addition to the dell mini
i bought this for my dell mini when they first came out much better than the envelope style cases dell sells with no padding i like the handle and the outside pocket holds the power cord just fine can still put this in a tote bag if needed
i tried a number of cases for my mini # before finding this one , which is just perfect the pocket on the front is large enough to fit the plug and a couple of other wires , it is well put together and comfortable to carry - i highly recommend it
i do n't really have much to say about this computer case it 's very simple , very well constructed , very protective of my dell mini- # , and exactly what i wanted zippers work well pocket fits power cord , usb cord , and a small mouse exactly what i wanted , would n't change a thing
i bought this for my wife 's mini and it is perfect it is great for travel because you can use the computer in the case it is small and sleek , which is what i wanted to go with a small and sleek computer i do n't see any problem with it , and i like that it is small like a sleeve but has a pocket for small accessories , like the power cord
it was a great bag , but , one of the handles is pulling out of the stitching and will soon break off the bag i ca n't find anything for a warrantee so i guess it is just headed for the trash can update : i found the warrantee information on another website -lrb- amazon take note -rrb- and i now have the means to apply for the `` lifetime warrantee `` on this bag hope it works
i have a # inch asus gaming laptop it 's quite heavy but # inch laptops are by nature that 's why i ca n't recommend this case the shoulder strap tore away from the case after only about # year of normal infrequent use it certainly is n't built to last additionally , the strap was fairly uncomfortable on the shoulder when carrying my laptop in it
it has a lot of room and a lot pockets to place things the quality of the bag is n't the best after using the bag for less than a week it started to fall apart the shoulder strap pad ripped and fell off after only a day of use other seems around the bag a coming apart for the price of the bag and how quick it started to fall apart i do n't suggest this bag at all this is one alienware product i am very disappointed in
strap and connections to bag are too weak and strap will break within # months with normal usage during the week edges of bag will be tearing by this time too only good thing is you can get a brand new one because it will fail before the # year warranty is up
this bag looks great and seemed to be of solid construction when i first got it with what i 'd consider medium use and very light travel duty -lrb- as a carry on -rrb- the stitching attaching one side of the handle completely ripped free i had a tailor restitch it with heavy duty thread and it 's fine again now padding does protect my alienware and the various compartments are well laid out and useful i would n't steer anyone away from this bag <unk> but it 's not a must have either if you can find another bag that will suit your purposes
well made , but heavy but , that 's simply a reflection of the quality of the bag lots of pockets one issue : the width is barely adequate to accommodate the # . # & # # ; laptop , but it does loosen up with use price was steep , but it is the only bag that works with this
like many others , i have found this to be a great bag , with the exception of the stitching holding up i bought mine direct from dell in dec # , and the stitching at the strap buckle came out about mar # , so it lasted # . # years my laptop is a gaming desktop replacement model from asus and is quite hefty i plan on buying another
nice bag for alienware laptop , little small for all other equipment can fit laptop , travel mouse , mouse pad , paper pad , # large school book , some pens and paper , and a backup tape , the charger cables , and a pda the pockets and deep and tight and the dividers are soft so they tend to fold over it does ok for my needs and looks nice but i wish it was a little bigger or roomier in the over pockets so i could access my stuff easier
this bag is all i could ever need it comfortably carries everything i need to carry and then some while my laptop itself is a little heavier than your usual one -lrb- alienware m # x -rrb- , it is <unk> to carry even with the additional stuff i have in the bag the only negative comment i have is there is no <unk> <unk> pocket for my phone located in this bag that in itself is not a big issue for me , i just like the things i buy to come with everything which was stated
a great bag for the buck to be sure this bag has more than enough room for my dell # r and even larger laptops would fit , and still room for my books and notebooks for class ample pockets and holders for pens and memory cards and <unk> other things stitching is great and tough padding and the armored front make for a well protected laptop and of course the geek chic <unk> of alienware is always high so get your nerd on and tote this bad boy it definitely gets the job done
i had purchased another & # # ; high quality brand & # # ; from a high end department store in the <unk> ny area we paid around $ # for the other brand thinking that if we spent the extra money the build quality would be the best we were wrong the high end bag strap fell apart and the bag itself started to fall apart i went online and found this one and it has performed flawlessly i felt i could trust alienware because of their great computer products this is a durable bag with a lot of great features a lot of thought went into the design from the compartments to the exterior design this bag is well worth the money
this is a great bag it was more than i expected it has enough room for not just my files that i carry with me but also my tablet and laptop accessories as well making everything more convenient
i ordered this messenger bag for my husband 's new alienware computer as it is a special size , it will not fit into normal computer bags i looked on the bottom of the computer to find the computer size then , i looked for a bag made specifically for that size alienware computer this one perfectly fits the bill it is heavily padded there are lots of pockets to put specific items my husband loves it
purchase a # . # hp notebook and had the hardest time finding a bag that would suit my needs and fit <unk> a suitcase was out of the question . this bag has all the slots , drops and holders for my needs
i carry my laptop back and forth from work to home everyday this bag has held up well over the past seven months of abuse i have had no problems with any of its features i would recommend this bag to anyone fyi : my laptop is a dell precision m # workstation
very sturdy bag very well made has lots of pockets and storage compartments it fit my # . # & # # ; hp laptop perfectly and will clearly give excellent protection due to amount of padding handles and shoulder strap are very comfortable zippers are heavy duty and work effortlessly i am very impressed with the quality for the price
i originally purchased this bag for a long trip i was taking by airplane it was perfect for getting through long tsa check points in airports so i liked it immediately after the trip i began to use it all the time , every day , to lug around my laptop this bag outlasted my laptop i rate it a great buy
this is a great laptop bag and i love it it is a bit big , but has many pockets and <unk> to stash all my stuff into it has alot of extra cushioning all around for outstanding protection the shoulder strap is very comfortable with extra cushioning too ! it has # large sections each with its own solid and heavy duty zippers and plenty of extra storage room large enough to carry my hp # in pavilion , the power adapter and much , much more it has # top carry handles with extra strong stitching and the whole case is very sturdy in appearance yes , it is a bit on the big side but after alot of searching i am very glad i got this bag i have used it everyday for # months now , carrying my work laptop & accessories back & forth to work and it shows no signs of any strain to it at all the shoulder strap has extra strong looking clips and should last a long time ! # stars
this case is sturdy and very well made it is user friendly and easily carries my # & # # ; alienware laptop easy to open and display the contents , and roomy enough to put two # & # # ; alienware laptops , along with # charging systems and mice definitely recommend this product for keeping your laptop safe and handy
i do n't plan on traveling with my laptop , but wanted a safe place to keep it and related items -lrb- manual , receipts , install discs -rrb- this case fits the bill , and the price was better than i had found elsewhere
just got an alienware laptop and could n't find anything else big enough to fit it i love the bag , it has all the bells and whistles ca n't say as to its durability yet though it does weigh like ten million pounds though
the bag is well constructed with many useful compartments i do like the airport security approved laptop section however some airports for some reason still will require that you remove the laptop , very <unk> i have been looking for the right bag for this laptop and i feel very satisfied with it
i bought this bag after many reviews , trying to decide which bag was the best for my new alienware m # x fortunately i chose this bag : the computer fits perfectly , the compartments are sufficient to carry the computer devices as well as my books and workbooks and several files the bag comes with a <unk> system to give extra security to your computer and prevent it from falling accidentally the strap is designed to withstand the weight of the computer , which is the main objective of the bag i have had laptop bags all my life , and this is excellent
