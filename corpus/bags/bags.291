loved the bag agree with previous review concerning the smell but certain it will go away with time love the colors especially the purple i collect <unk> and butterflies so its the perfect bag !
we <unk> my # year old grand daughter her first lap top and this bag was just the right bag for her to carry it in she loved the butterflies and so did i
this is exactly what it looked like on amazon and i am thrilled with it i have n't used it yet but i am sure it will fulfill all my
i chose five stars because you ca n't find this product for a good price as i did other carrying cases were more expensive and this one fit my budget it was what i expected
the bag is the perfect size for my pavilion dv # laptop it 's a gorgeous print the only downside is that it doesnt really have a place for the cord to go but i just put it in with the computer also , there is a bit of a smell but nothing unbearable and nothing that wo n't probably go away once it 's been out a bit overall very satisfied with the product
i order this case for my granddaughter for christmas for her laptop when i received it i fell in love with it the color are so cool and it also have a matching <unk> go with it she is really going to love it i just know it and it did n't take no time to get here it was worth my money will like to order again soon
i bought this for my husband he really likes the bag , i thought it was a good buy for it 's price if you need a simple bag that 's not too pricey , but practical , you may enjoy this one
i bought this to carry with me on a # week trip i was exactly the size that i wanted it worked out perfectly for all of my tickets , passports and other paraphernalia i am giving it # stars instead of # because i could have use one or two more inside pouches but just great for the price and i really like this for traveling
gave this as a gift to my son in law since he was still using a backpack in his new office environment he says he would have liked a little more depth in one of the pockets to store his lunch , but otherwise he 's
very satisfied with the product so far - a good deal for its price i have been using it for a month , and it does n't have a scratch or a mark good way to carry a laptop or couple of books and a notebook i really do recommend this product
i originally gave this bag four stars unfortunately , the bag has ripped again in the same spot next zipper i will need to send back to tumi once again and waist my time and money stylish yes ! quality , no way at over $ # i expected a much better product save your money and buy a quality bag i have owned several backpacks for work and never had any problem so much for upgrading to look stylish and cool with an expensive name brand
great bag -- one big issue there 's very little padding on the bottom of the laptop compartment you 'll have to be very careful when putting your bag down i would not have purchased this bag had i known this seems like a simple fix for an otherwise great bag and brand
this is my second ballistic nylon tumi backpack the first lasted # years of daily usage this one should as well great storage of peripherals as well as ipad and notebook tumi prices are higher than most , but the quality is worth it
i ought this for my mac and very pleased with it it 's light and has plenty of room i also like how it <unk> the weight of my mac book pro , so it 's very comfortable to carry a lot of pockets to carry stuff
this thing is solid very strudy and well made , just what you would expect from tumi as others have mentioned , i wish there was a little <unk> in the laptop section of the bag i added a small piece of foam and it did the trick seems like this would be an easy fix for tumi
i travel by plane each week and wanted a bag with adequate space , plenty of the right sized pockets , and top quality this bag fits the bill my favorite aspects are that it stands up when opened , more like a briefcase rather than a backpack i travel with a lenovo brick -lrb- work -rrb- and a macbook air -lrb- personal -rrb- , both fit well in the computer pocket other notable features waterproof water bottle pocket that can fit a liter <unk> sleeve to set on top of a roller bag -lrb- why in the world to more backpacks not have this ? ? do n't get me wrong , $ # for a bag was tough to shell out , but for something that i use everyday , it 's worth it to me
when i got this in the mail i was so excited because of the great reviews i read on amazon but when i got the case it looked used and made my new computer look <unk> and old
causes the screen on the mba to constantly fall back i too my pc back to apple , they removed the case , and sure enough , no more screen <unk> -- i really wanted to like this thing , but , sorry
the top part fits and i love the feel of it but the bottom part does n't snap on all the way i can force it on but it just pops off and it covers a speaker i emailed the seller but they have n't gotten back to me yet :
i would have rated it a # if i could use the whole case , currently i only have the bottom part attached , no matter how many times i tried i could not get it to snap into place
this case was really difficult to put on i used it for a couple of months but it was really easy to get it dirty , and left marks even if you just touched it with wet hands i had a battle trying to take it off do not recommend it
it was advertised as fitting a macbook pro , but it does n't fit not that it cost much - a few dollars - but then not worth returning since the price of shipping will exceed the cost of the item i really wish the description had been accurate do n't always believe with you read , unless you believe me what i say it wo n't fit your macbook pro i think it 's probably for an air
do n't be cheat by this item any more ! ! amazon has two similar items for blue macbook air case one is $ # . # on amazon prime , the other is $ # . # adding $ # shipping fee but when i selected one of them , it would automatically jump onto the other one when <unk> the result was , i bought the $ # . # + $ # one but it jumped to the $ # . # + prime shipping since i did n't buy any other items , it charged almost $ # for shipping i hope you can make a double <unk> about that and hope <unk> servers can fix this bug
waited # weeks only to receive wrong case sent picture of case not fitting my laptop and they still did n't care they told me they do n't mix up cases and that basically i was stuck with what they sent me then proceeded to direct me to amazons return policy spend the extra money and buy it at a store , at least you wo n't be throwing money out the window
seems like it will be good quality when you first get it out of the packaging . # of the snap clips broken immediatly the first time i put it on would not buy again
garbage , although the seller is great . product was not as stated , received wrong color etc . the sellers are great and easy to work with and <unk> to and they will fix the
i had this for my macbook , and like the other hard shell cases it did n't last at all i never dropped it , and it cracked in # months i 've had zero luck with these types of covers and have since switched to a leather case with a zipper these are a total waste of money too bad , because they 're really cute
this product arrived cracked in a <unk> of the bottom piece when i put it on my computer my computer would not fully close it is also extremely difficult to take off
a very disappointed daughter when this case arrives for her # `` mac & did n't fit : -lrb- i did n't think it would be so difficult to buy a cover on line
does not fit on my macbook air looks good but does not in way fit just a waste of money forgot who the supplier is but will never purchase a product with an unknown name
i have the right model number -lrb- a # -rrb- and the top cover fits fine but the bottom cover does not it does not snap on all the way and it is quite frustrating
i like how it feels and all that but the case i got is loose on the left corner . it snaps off . i need a refund or a better
fits perfect and ships fast the only thing is that it had a physical damage it had a spot that i tried to remove but was not able to do so but what you pay is what you get other than that good
the bottom part of the case does n't fit it 's definitely a defect with my particular case , i tried this case out before buying since a colleague has the same one with the exact same laptop as mine
i bought this case and it did not come with a keyboard cover as shown in the photos the bottom panel did n't fit my macbook air at all it slid and i would not trust it on a $ #
this product does not look like the picture and is not as described by being `` see through `` ! ! # % opaque and no chance of seeing apple logo when intact do not order this cover if you want one that looks like the picture ! not accurate ! ! !
the top part of the case snapped on just fine but no amount of squeezing , shifting , and <unk> made the bottom snap into place without the bottom , it 's just eye candy with no protection at all
i had high hopes for this case , after reading reviews , but when i received the case i was seriously let down after searching for covers for my new work computer , i settled on this cover because of the price and the color the cover itself is a beautiful mint green and matted , which is what i was looking for i have other mac products and cases -lrb- never had a topcase before -rrb- , for personal use , and have had many cases crack because of those experiences i am not inclined to spend a lot of money on something i expect to replace down the road -lrb- especially since it is for work purposes -rrb- that being said , this cover does not <unk> on the case the top cover will not latch on completely , and the bottom cover will not stay latched i already have it <unk> to return , and will be spending more money on one i know actually does fit i wish this case had worked out , i just do n't understand how many people have had success with this product
i purchased this cover in july # i liked that it provided some protection for my macbook air i have not had the ` fitting ' issue so many others have reported , but the case is cracking in several places and pieces of it have fallen off the area on each side where the usb ports and the power connections are seems to be the weak point where this happens i 'm not sure what the return policy on this item is , but i would expect something like this to last longer than # months before it starts coming apart i think that if the manufacturer has discovered a problem with the design and fit of this product , they should offer to replace it for anyone who purchased the covers with the problem
the bottom of the case is not suitable for my air and the top of the case can not take off i tried several times by using knife , scissor and <unk>
more of a transparent food coloring yellow that a deeper one you see on the pics also more plastic mix than a <unk> plastic you get what you pay
every order i have gotten it has been the wrong order first , i ordered a blue macbook air case and it came the wrong color then they sent me another one and it was blue but not even for the macbook air
purchased this case as it had mostly positive reviews , i 'm not sure how that is possible i have the a # model of the macbook air # & # # ; -lrb- # version w / # microphones -rrb- the case simply does not fit onto the computer the side latches do not catch the computer and the bottom cover will not stay on the foam feet on the bottom of the case are pretty poor in quality , as is the case in general it 's only $ # . # so i guess you are getting what you pay for with this if you have an a # model macbook air , i 'd avoid this case completely and just spend a few more dollars elsewhere
i bought this case because i knew my niece was getting a # & # # ; macbook air for christmas and i loved the colors available and the price what a disappointment ... the case does n't fit the macbook air we tried getting the case on the mac air all christmas day i hope i can return it
i do not what material is this cover , but i see the finger prints every time . . i guess if i use a week , this cover will be covered with finger prints even i had to remove this with water it gets finger prints so easily i regret buying this i should have spent more money for high quality
received my case in the pink color , does not fit the macbook air . it is made for a macbook pro , i have another case my old macbook pro and it is exactly the same very disappointed . even made sure to match my model number to the one in the picture do not buy this
this item was very poorly made it is very flimsy plastic we ca n't use it there are plastic pieces that will scratch the computer so it 's sitting on a
i got this product and thought i was getting such a great deal <unk> to the apple store i got it and it was not like it was pictured at all waste of time
i received my top case very quickly so i was very excited to open it and put it on my macbook air # inch unfortunately it does not fit i am extremely disappointed in this product
although the material its made of is great , protective and gives just enough grip , the fit is just a little off the <unk> molded into the back and top to keep the cover on do n't grab enough of the side of the laptop to keep it on i wish i could have noticed this before i purchased # of them , i would have found a little better design and maybe paid a little more
i got this for christmas and the top fits fine , but one of the tabs will not stay on the bottom it feels cheap and flimsy it is not secure
i did n't think i was buying a used product , but when i received this , the very flimsy plastic feet were already dirty and the case was scratched all over the top it does n't fit well and is easy to pop off i needed something to protect my new mac book for my work commute , so i kept it in this case there is truth to the & # # ; buy cheap , buy twice . & # # ; i will be replacing it soon with a speck product like i had from my first macbook air
case might come defective ! ! one of the tabs for the bottom half of the case came <unk> so only the left side of the case is held in case is also loosely fitted on the bottom portion does n't fit snug , there 's a noticeable gap between the macbook air and the case itself the back of the tabs on the bottom case also does not snap onto the macbook air at all whatsoever i would not recommend it at all and would not buy it again
i got it today but it 's light red and kind of like pink i do n't know what color it is exactly i did n't get keyboard protector the case still have some <unk> that lost color it is definitely different to picture and low quality
i bought two one came broken , one was perfect the one with a broken corner would not stay on shipper replaced item but i had to pay returned shipping would be better to not ship items like this inside envelopes with bubble wrap , it does n't work when the item is not completely flat
the bottom of this case is loose , and slides forward when the macbook is opened more than # degrees as soon as i get a replacement , i will be returning this
product does not fit my air ! ! i ordered from topcase because i ordered the same color and kind for my pro and it fit perfectly no problems this case does not fit at all will be returning and finding something else if anyone have any suggestions on cases that do fit -lrb- orange color -rrb- please let me know i am very disappointed ! ! i wanted to give it no stars but of course that 's not an option update : after doing some research , i realized that not all the air 's were made the same -lrb- body style was -rrb- i was unaware of that fact when i purchased the case potential buyers be sure to look at the pictures and the model style number before purchasing a case for your air
after # months of use the case is cracked and broken because it did not fit <unk> # & # # ; closely , this was the expensive option and was a waste of money i will be looking into the <unk> versions that a friend of mine has and <unk> similar but a much better fit
i ordered a case cover for a macbook air # , but recieved a cover for a tablet when i inquired if it could be returned , as it was purchased early as a gift , i received a blank response completely disappointed as i wasted my money
i hate this case it does not stay snapped onto the computer instead , whenever i open my laptop , i 'm struggling to not pop off the plastic case my last case worked so much better i 'm going to pay for quality next time ! ! !
bottom case i received did not fit my new model macbook air they sent me a replacement that also did not fit i finally decided to go with a different brand material is stiff and cheap feels as though it will chip easily
within the first week , the rubber started to peel then , little splits started to show up which eventually grew into larger cracks i 'm a responsible adult who takes care of things so its not as thought it was banged around or misused it 's just very poor quality i now , after just a couple of months , have to replace this would n't recommend it unless you are okay with buying a new one every couple of months
the cover was <unk> and could not properly & # # ; t my # -inch macbook air i was thoroughly disappointed by this defect as i ordered this for my birthday and it could hardly even go on the computer without being incredibly loose and cheap
product did not fit my computer i made sure all model numbers matched and it just refuses to fully clip on i would not send my hard <unk> dollars again on this subpar
there 's nothing else to say but : it does n't fit the # & # # ; macbook air mid- # it only clips around one side , not on both , because it 's too small , so it does n't stay on do n't buy it
i do like it , but when i tried to put it on , it seems the bottom case was too small and wo n't snap on all the way so it does n't
the bottom cover broke after # months of use i did n't have problems fitting the top or the bottom part to the macbook air # inch released in # during the # months of use , the case came off # times but i had no trouble snapping it back in place i did however notice that while trying to open the air , the edge of the top cover would touch the edge of the bottom cover and the bottom cover and would make a very light creaking noise i believe that is what finally broke the bottom piece it was good while it lasted but not the best design
i have not dropped the case the laptop travels in my padded laptop bag in between work and home where i use it the side clip on the bottom has broken off , and the bottom right back corner has also completely broken off i expected this case to last at least a year also the case is fairly difficult to get on and off =
my complaint is not with the delivery process but its with the product itself the design is flawed the case makes a popping sound when you open the screen the next flaw is that its to heavy to hold the screen up when the case it on i find if i move the computer at all the screen is falling down this particular case may work better on the macbook pro , but for the macbook air it does not work well i used this on a brand new macbook air also so it was not a worn out hinge on the laptop
top cover works great bottom cover ... not so much does n't fit properly and does n't clasp the front where the track pad is very annoying while typing ... ... especially this review might just throw the bottom away or topcase could send me a new bottom
let me start with the pros - it shipped quickly and i received it within a few <unk> affordable and is close to what i was <unk> the cons - the color is different than the <unk> & # # ; rubberized & # # ; hard case is really just a hard case it 's pretty slick and the plastic is <unk> does n't fit properly the top fits fine but the bottom does n't click into place at all and it covers one of the microphones overall i guess i got what i paid for i 'm going to replace it though because it 's just not good quality at all i am going to buy something else
the case just did not fit the # inch mac book air and the quality was a bit of a disappointment as well as a mystery the case was described as being rubberized , but was mere plastic by my inspection and attempted installation of the case where 's the rubber
the bottom part of the case did not fit my macbook air one side fits on nice but the other side it does n't completely fit on it still stays on and has n't fallen off yet , but it works
it seems to protect well but it shows every fingerprint and smudge fit was good , and it has held up well for six months price was right but to pull out a macair that looks like it was used as a dinner plate is a bit off-putting btw my case is <unk> dark grey so maybe other colors do n't show smudges and <unk> as much
i have the most recent macbook air and the bottom does not fit i got another bottom shipped to me because i thought maybe i just got a defective case but the new bottom also does n't fit it does look nice and feel nice and i love the pink color i would not recommend this case to anyone i guess you pay for the quality
it came broken and it is cheap looking the color is nice and it fits perfectly though it 's a lil more green than the pic i wish it didnt come broken i have to return it
nice enough shell , the price is certainly right , but it does not work for the new macbook air -lrb- a # -rrb- covers the microphone holes i <unk> an exchange for the , supposedly , available updated shell , but amazon pointed me towards a return , instead
this case sucks it took me forever to put the bottom part because one of the clips would n't reach the edge of my air so i had to push down with a lot of force for it to snap on once i got it on , i opened up my air and i noticed that one of the clips of the bottom part on the upper right side scratches the bottom sides of the screen you have to keep the screen at a # degree angle or else it will always scratch it the only good thing about this case is that it has a nice look and feel to it , but if i could go back i would <unk> not buy this case at all i recommend to avoid this
so i bought this because the ones at the apple store were extremely expensive this is at a great price i got the green case and it looks great the reason i 'm posting this , however , is that it does n't fit properly the top part is is super flimsy and looks like it could fall off and the bottom just keeps sliding i have a the # & # # ; macbook air and it just simply does not fit well
this was a great amazon price for the product , but unfortunately the tabs that keep the case on the lower chassis of the mac air did not fit properly on one side the case stayed on but always stuck out a bit on that side , and over the few months that i 've had it the tab and the surrounding material of the case has started to break
when this cover arrived it was broken so i decided to send it back but i tried it on to see how it fit it was nearly impossible to take off and actually chipped a piece of my macbook air off at the top i 'm still looking for a good quality cover that wo n't be so frustrating to take off
i bought this case right after i got my new air for christmas , and now only # months later , it is falling apart i am very careful with my computer when i take it places it goes in a quilted case inside another bag , like a backpack yet despite my best efforts the bottom of the case has begun to crack and the pieces that attach it to the computer are breaking off the top portion is fine but the bottom portion can not hold up to everyday use
i heard a few things regarding the difficulty to remove this particular case but i was n't too concerned i was very excited to receive it and immediately went to put it on my laptop unfortunately it is too tight to get all the corners in place the bottom went on without a fight but the top case refuses to snap all four corners on at the same time i still use it because it is better than nothing but it kinda sucks :
i had this case for about a month and it started chipping on the edges the chips started growing and now the case is almost broken and wo n't stay on my macbook air this is a cheap case and that is exactly what you get i do n't recommend buying this case , you will just waste your money
the color is not even close to that of the picture i received the case in an envelope instead of a box so my mail person decided to shove it in my mailbox i did not receive a topcase mousepad which i find i probably do n't need , however i do n't like paying for something that i do not receive also , as others have reported , my case does not fit one of the clips on the bottom will not fasten no matter how many times i try to make it fit all in all i am not satisfied
the color of the cover was what i expected , but there was a smudge on the cover , in the <unk> texture the color was still there , but the smudge was huge and ugly i returned this
i bought this case at the beginning of the school year , and the bottom piece has n't lasted through the first semester i am in college , so it is in my backpack a lot , but i have n't dropped it the bottom barely even stays on anymore , but the top is just fine i was hoping to be able to use this case for more than a couple months but i think i have to buy a new one
like other poor star reviews say , it is not the right size for all macbook airs it does not firmly latch on and the little plastic pieces that hold it on the computer broke within a couple months the rubber feet thing also fell off almost right away it looks okay and i guess you get what you pay for , but it is definitely not a durable case
i like the looks of the case but disappointed that it arrived with a small crack on the edge of the bottom lid no quality control easy to snap on have requested a replacement and will see how that works
received my case cover its nice color , i do really love rubberized case but the cover i received today has long scratch on top of the cover i am disappointed ... :
nice fit for my mac air , and does the job for about # months top cover is fine , but bottom cover will crack around the ports on both sides and then no longer stay on the computer ok if you want to replace it every #
almost a tale of two cases base half looks cheap , has unnecessary vents and falls off top half looks good , but since the bottom keeps falling off , i tried taking the top portion off and it is seemingly impossible short of smashing my screen under the pressure , i am not sure how i will be able to do it next time i will just spring for a speck case -lrb- that i have for my macbook pro and its great -rrb-
i was so excited to get a blue cover from topcase for my new macbook air that was affordable and looked great as a decoration , this top case cover is fantastic , but that is really as far as it goes i have found that it is not protective and have experienced damage to my computer because i thought the hard case cover would be more protective than it is as other reviews state too , the fit is not fantastic , which may have partially been the problem too i do n't recommend this if you want something protective , but if you want some color on your computer , they have some great ones
even thought it said it fit my model macbook air i had to put a lot of <unk> into the case to get it to go on it does sometimes pop off and i have a heck of a time getting it back on
definitely got what i paid for it was very cheaply made and fell apart quickly it did n't even fit my computer properly it would be worth it to spend more money on a better made case
broke after # months i placed on my laptop and never removed it until i came off the clips on the edge just broke i guess you get what you pay
i love the color of this case & the protection it gives my macbook unfortunately , the bottom does not fit correctly and i am unable to get it to completely snap into place i am still able to use the case but it is uncomfortable at this price point it is too much of a hassle to return the item suggest the manufacturer fix their design flaw as i see others have had the same problem
this case is n't that bad for the price but just so you are aware , the plastic hinges on the corners can be easily broken and the case will crack after a while it is difficult to put on
i bought the yellow case , and it fits perfectly the one and only negative is that it always looks dirty there 's always fingerprints on it , and i try wiping them off , but they never really go away i 'm going to look for another case
it would n't snap on my # inch macbook air , even though i kept trying to squeeze it on then , my computer would n't turn on i took my macbook air to the apple store and they told me that if i squeezed the screen , i could damage my computer a very costly mistake i threw the cover away
