this bag was literally exactly what i was looking for , a laptop bag with enough space for a large file , so i could eliminate bringing both a laptop case and a briefcase to meetings unfortunately , # minutes after i opened the box , i tried to put a file into the bag and as soon as i zipped it , the zipper ripped at the seam i think this may have just been a defective unit , but i felt <unk> to tell people that the quality probably is n't the best if you plan on using this bag for very `` light duty `` use , such as small files and maybe a light change of clothes , it will probably work if you plan on putting any stress on the zippers at all , you might want to look elsewhere i returned this and went with the wenger patriot granted it 's about # $ more expensive , but the quality is better none of these bags are perfect though , and this is the best you 're going to get in this price range
the main reason i dislike this bag is because , as other reviewers have said , the handle feels flimsy it did not open evenly nor did it close down evenly the handles also did not stay upright when i wanted it to all worrisome for a brand new product that 's going to hold heavy and fragile and expensive materials i like that it has <unk> folder compartments
i love the size , the organization , the layout , but the handle leaves much to be desired the bag is fairly well made the handle , not so much hopefully i wo n't give it such a workout that it falls off somewhere overseas if it does i 'll <unk> this review but for now i am satisfied
the inner zipper on mine keeps getting caught on the inner lining nice bad though , holds everything i need it to hold the wheels are sturdy and the <unk> handle works fine
it says that it holds a # inch laptop but actually it is # - # inch laptop my # inch dell inspiron * barely * fits other than that , the quality is superb
zippers do n't appear to be in it for the long run they seem flimsy do n't overpack or you may need to buy another but price is reasonable for what you get
i had a hard time writing a review for this product because i found it trying to live in the middle of two different product segments and ultimately doing not as well as either a typical laptop bag is cheaper and far lighter than this while you trade capacity and the <unk> , you save big time on weight which turns out to be somewhat of an issue with this product given the weight and size of this product , i find myself comparing it more to `` luggage `` instead of `` a laptop bag `` and as luggage , this is a very poor quality product the zippers catch all the time i am constantly fighting the zipper as it kinks up compared to the smooth zippers on my <unk> luggage , the zippers on this are <unk> if you have a product with a telescoping handle and wheels , i recommend you <unk> up more money for a real piece of luggage such as this <unk> escape # `` rolling organizer <unk> you 'll get the same capacity but much better quality
everything is great with the exception of the telescoping handle which is quite light and fragile and appears it wo n't stand up to much travel the handle feels like it is too light for the size of the bag and twists very easily
i 've owned two of these well-designed cases the first served my well for years until the wheel 's bearings became noisy the second -lrb- this purchase -rrb- seems to have <unk> problems with its telescoping handle which jams sometimes and other times has become unstable -lrb- not remaining securely locked in extended position -rrb-
it is two heavy and bulky in short time fabric at bottom edges started to wear out zippers are good rolling handle is just ok and not so easily works in and out
this laptop case is made pretty good but it does not fit a # `` very well the dimensions are actually # . # x # . # x # . # `` i have a # `` dell m # that barely fits they need to advertise the complete dimensions otherwise , it 's a good case
i really like this bag it 's incredibly light and i can bring everything i need for one or two days of business travel in a single bag it fits my # `` laptop just fine , and i can carry two days worth of clothes and stuff with me i like the <unk> compartment - though i use that for books and magazines it seems well built and i like that it rolls previously i 'd carry a rolling carry-on bag , and sling my laptop bag this makes travel so much easier
this bag is perfect for day trips i am able to cart around my computer , lunch , extra shoes etc . it is small so it tucks out of the way easily it rolls smoothly my only complaint is that the handle feels a little flimsy i would love this bag if the handle was n't so wobbly
i use this to haul around marketing materials , a sign , and a <unk> to college and career fairs it is lightweight , durable , and very easy to maneuver i love the compact size and the handle on top to easily lift it and stow it in the car trunk without scratching my car the telescoping handle is really , really nice and very well made my only criticism is i do n't much care for the layout of the largest compartment you have to lay the whole case down on its side -lrb- instead of upright like the photo -rrb- , unzip it the whole way around and open it up like a book it 's just cumbersome and unprofessional looking i would have preferred a top-loading compartment like the others other than that i 'm very happy with this and it has lasted me ten times longer than other similar products i 've used
i consider this bag a useful efficient and great sized bag , for travel or everyday moving i like the bags simplicity and easy cleaning of scraps and dirt i just feel that when full it kind of loses a little its square
i like this case in general i do n't love the colored stripes in some of the pockets because it makes you think that you may have a leaking marker i love the wheels i do n't like the handle and i 'm <unk> that it does n't break soon
i traveled with my new case logic rolling case and here are few of the <unk> during my first travel if you travel economy class , then this roller case is too big to roll through the aisle you 'll have to lift it in your hand and walk all the way to your seat the handle is a bit loose but there 's no problem while rolling it 's spacious and takes in all that it promises looks are not very attractive but it looks as shown in pics so it 's not disappointing value for money
i ordered this because i had an <unk> trip the case is a little large for someone who can not lift a lot of weight filled with computer and some personal items , this was a little heavy and awkward to lift to the overhead bin of the smaller regional jets i had to check it plane side on one leg of my trip it served it 's purpose , but was a little heavy for me
i replace my swiss army knife bag with this case logic bag ; so i am not a <unk> to rolling laptop bag my job takes me on the road a lot and this bag is actually smaller than the one i had but it hold a lot more i know it is smaller because i can drag this bag through the nyc subway <unk> without the bag touching the <unk> i love the overnight clothing compartment it is perfect to hold # or even # nights of change of cloths plus your toiletries it is great for a short business trip because i never had to worry about not finding overhead space on the plane i like the fact that all the zipper zips all the way down to the bottom of the bag this allows easy access to each of the compartments the only thing bad i will say about this bag is that the zippers ' teeth do not engage and i had to unzip and zip again
i was going out of town and wanted something more than a notebook carrier i was able to take all of my laptop accessories i also took my portable dvd player -lrb- to do with lessons on my notebook -rrb- , pens , cords , files and drives plus clothing in the large area storage and it fit under the seat in front of me i was worried about the handle after reading other reviews , but mine seemed fine , and it 's very long , so great for taller people as well it 's a great value
i am getting ready to use the bag next week for the first time the case logic is a great looking bag and seems very durable it has two compartments , one for quick access to your personal items and laptop and one side for clothes i really like it and a it consider it a great value for the money
this case is big enough to hold an alienware m # x comfortably and securely there 's even a strap in the laptop pocket that holds it in place , so if you have a smaller computer , no problem there are lots of pockets and extra space for external hard drives , ipods , cameras , games ... just about anything but an external printer for minimalist traveling , you could probably just throw in your computer , and one or two changes of clothes & toiletries of course , all that stuff can get heavy who has n't carried a heavy laptop on their shoulder wishing they had some other way of transporting it the wheels on the bottom make it very easy to carry around , much like a suitcase with expandable handle , and it fits easily in most overhead storage compartments i ca n't think of anything bad to say about it if you carry a heavy laptop & a lot of accessories , i highly recommend it
after a month , i 'm still happy with this case which i use as a traveling office as a field <unk> , i often carry rather than roll this case into homes previous leather cases were much too heavy the handle telescopes nicely and seems sturdier than others i 've had i like the padding for the laptop fits nicely on floor of front passenger seat
an employee in our <unk> needed a <unk> to transport her laptop and peripheral materials to <unk> departments for presentations instead , we recommended this reasonably priced laptop case it weighs so little , it is easy to handle , holds everything needed for a presentation , and is both stylish and functional an excellent value
this case is perfect a place for your laptop and a few other things a place for your tickets -lrb- front compartment -rrb- or a book a place -lrb- large place too -rrb- for a few items of clothing or what ever else you might need to take with you on the flight and it is cool that the handle can be enclosed that way it has less of a chance to get snagged on something and possibly ruined it is sturdy and well built it fits in the overhead compartment easily all in all , it is a very nice case and i would recommend it to family and friends
needed a bag i can use for overnight trip and take it to meetings without looking out of place perfect size for all the items i need for such trips - space for documents , laptop and clothes the bag appears sturdy and is very functional very pleased with the purchase
have already used this case on a business trip for the first time ever , the airline i am currently using lost my checked baggage i had a complete change in this case along with my computer my # `` laptop just barely fits and there is often some difficulty in removing it for use a great case and exceeded expectations
i am so glad i bought this it was great used it on my vacation was easy to use my laptop just fit its hard to find a laptop bag for my laptop lots of space for spare clothes and shoes
i am very pleased with this product my previous laptop case was an `` <unk> `` type and it seemed to be getting heavier and heavier there is room for several binders in the area designed for clothes
bought this case for a surprise weekend gift hoped it would fit my # inch dell and my clothes was able to fit not just my dell , but a portfolio and # days worth of clothes including a pair of shoes true i had to roll the clothing , but i did n't expect to be able to get that much in - without damaging the case no damage or stress to the cast and the trip was a huge success
this was my first caselogic purchase , but it will not be the last i am surprised by the simplicity and <unk> of this case i just wish that this product had rubber wheels -lrb- it makes a very annoying rolling noise -rrb- i know this sounds <unk> , but that was the only short coming this product had
i am very happy with this rolling case , light weight and a lot of compartment , the cell phone on the front pouch not as easy to access i just use inside pocket for my cell phone working well
my wife uses it every day for a year and it has held up very well her massive # in laptop just barely fits , but it 's hard to find one that big anyway
i purchased the case last week and after # days of use , the zipper broke i think its because the case is a snug fit around the laptop and you really have to force it to make sure there 's enough space at the end to zip it up completely this time i did n't bother doing that and the zipper came off the track otherwise , its a nice case , there 's enough room on the side pocket to keep the power supply , # tb portable drive , and a wireless microsoft arc mouse
i bought the hp pavilion dv # us # . # -inch laptop , and as it was advertised `` frequently bought together `` , i also ordered this great looking sleeve when received i found out that it is a great sleeve , but does not fit this laptop the bad review does not go to the sleeve itself but to amazon , or whoever bought the sleeve for this laptop .
this case fits my hp laptop like a glove i ca n't say the same for the side pocket however -- it does not have any room for expansion except for the <unk> of the neoprene material hence , by the time you add the transformer , power cord , a mouse , and maybe a couple of other items it gets pretty lumpy and the neoprene is a bit stretched it feels like it will be a bit vulnerable after some use hope i 'm wrong i might end up using the targus carrying case from the laptop i replaced since it has a more expandable and durable side pocket with a flap for closing
i have a new hp # . # `` laptop the # us thus it <unk> me that hp <unk> this bag to fit up to # `` and it barely fits my # . # `` my brothers older hp fit perfectly , however this bag is to match the newer styled laptops , so why would n't it fit them correctly its nice looking , and good quality , but the fit scares me i wonder how many people with # `` laptops have gotten this and realized it did n't fit
just as the title says , this sleeve is too small i have the hp # `` and bought these as a package even after a few weeks the sleeve is too difficult to get on and off
after reading everyone 's review i took the risk and bought the case for my hp hdx # t it does n't fit very disappointed as there are few sleeve 's with handles that are affordable the case is well made but my laptop measuring # . # -lrb- w -rrb- x # . # `` -lrb- d -rrb- x # . # -lrb- min h -rrb- did not fit the last corner could not be zipped closed and that is without the cord confused as to why some people 's laptops fit and others do n't
i really like this sleeve really sharp looking i know a sleeve is suppose to be tight , but could have been a little roomier do n't plan on packing much in this one
i had read other reviews of this product before purchasing and was aware that it might be a tight fit -- and it was i have a # . # `` screen and this was advertised to fit up to # `` computers but i realize it is a ` skin ' and not a case , so i would expect a tight fit just be aware -- the zipper is a little hard to zip completely , but it is a great sleeve for carrying your laptop around
i love this sleeve but i wish it would be a bit bigger or that it was available in a bigger size i have a dell studio xps # and while the sleeve expands to fit it , the zipper does n't , making the corners bulge out a bit through it i like the look and feel of the sleeve itself but i worry about the computer corners getting scratched by forcing the zipper open and closed all the time too bad they do n't make a # `` version -lrb- or i have n't found it so far -rrb-
i just ordered this item after searching thru available sleeves i have a # . # <unk> # i laptop and i want to be able to use the case to hold my adapter and wireless mouse , along with my # cell battery the # `` version of this case seems way too small i compared this to the a sleeve by caselogic -lrb- meant for a # `` -rrb- and the measurements were almost the same after reading all the other reviews everyone says this is sometimes small for a # `` , so i figured this would be just right for mine i have n't gotten it yet and i will update this review once i see how everything fits inside
i loved it . is as expected . protects my laptop , i can carry in a bag or just using the handle i can also store cables and other accessories
i bought this because i did n't want to carry a wheely bag . the handle is good and sturdy and i 've had no issue its a perfect fit for my dell laptop
i have the hp # . # `` pavilion dv # us , and this sleeve fits it perfectly i love the feel of the neoprene material , and it 's super soft on the inside great protection for my laptop i 'm very satisfied with my purchase ! :
i really ca n't figure out what the complaining is about # -rrb- the case fits my hp envy # -lrb- with a # . # & # # ; screen -rrb- perfectly # -rrb- it 's a sleeve it 's supposed to fit like a sleeve # -rrb- the design is perfect and the handle is extremely convenient for a sleeve i would only add a long strap if i could improve it
although it is intended for the hp dv # line of products , i bought it for my new dv # us , which by the way is a very nice all-around laptop except the touchpad for the dv # , this sleeve is half a inch too long since i 'd like to carry the charge and the mouse with the computer , # `` sleeve would have been too tight overall , i am very happy with the product and will recommend
ordered for acer # . # netbook based on reviews dissapointed . reviewers must not have been looking at the same item the one pocket is small and can not hold the wire and charger the shoulder strap is very <unk> would return except not worth the hassle will buy another where i can see before buying
it 's a nice case i wish there was more padding on the inside and more pockets -lrb- there is one -rrb- but for the price , it looks nice -lrb- nice bright color without being obnoxious -rrb- and is very functional
i purchased this sleeve for my new acer notebook and was pleasantly surprised at the high quality item i received it is high quality through and through would recommend this item to all
i was expecting to get a sleeve that was like a wetsuit that would keep my expensive small computer dry and protect it from small bumps i got a cloth sleeve with a white foam free moving sheet inside what a waste of money a true <unk> let down for a close to $ # k computer it is a play on words to use the name apple as the first word in advertising this it has nothing to do with the apple company and it is trash i did not read the reviews before buying it but no one uses it for what it is advertised as i got ripped off big time
i got this because i wanted a sleeve that would n't take up too much room in my shoulder bag , yet is durable enough for basic protection and for sending through airport security <unk> it fits my macbook air # `` -lrb- late # edition -rrb- just fine as you might expect from a thinner case , it does n't have a lot of padding but for use inside a reasonably cushioned bag or briefcase , it 's fine i would n't suggest using this as standalone protection i did add a few rows of bubble wrap rolled up into a tube at the bottom of the case to provide extra shock cushioning for my daily commute
the case arrived quickly , and seems to be constructed ok , but this is not a sleeve made for a macbook air , that 's for sure i could see the full on macbook pro # `` fitting , but my air has way too much extra room to move around in the sleeve the inside is soft , but the seams could be covered better / be constructed of a little softer material i would n't say the sleeve is terrible , if you have a # inch macbook or a fatter netbook it would most likely be fine as it is , i wo n't be using this sleeve and will be looking for a slightly better fit
this sleeve is ok , it 's thin and does n't really have much padding it 's better than nothing and relatively inexpensive but it does n't provide a whole lot of protection i would recommend spending an extra # or # dollars and getting something better
i went with this product because it was cheaper , but now i wish i had just <unk> the extra $ # - $ # for a thicker one i 've recently <unk> a series of dents and scratches from the zipper that certainly would have been avoided with a <unk> case that said , if you 're only looking for a moderate amount of <unk> -lrb- i.e . no fuzzy insides , foam inserts , etc . -rrb- , then this case should do you <unk> fine
i bought this for my son who was getting a new lap top for christmas i got it because it would enclose the computer and necessary accessories and had a handle -lrb- good for extra secure grip -rrb- instead of the normal laptop sleeve overall very pleased with the product liked the uniqueness of the accessory pockets and the cost was within reason
this was just as described and a perfect fit for my dell latitude i needed a bag for my laptop that would fit in my roller bag so i could <unk> it out if i needed to check the bigger bag plane side
i love this laptop sleeve i use it at work to carry my laptop , eye glasses , small wallet and it has a small pouch for a mouse and my iphone everyone has commented on this sleeve sat work it 's light and still can pass off as professional i would definitely recommend this
great quality , protection is good , the handle is very handy when carrying the laptop , and the pockets are very useful for the mouse and charging cable the pockets can be too small if you have a bulky charger or a large mouse overall , good for travelling , not so good for a carry on i got a sleeve type for the carry on instead
i got this a as a gift for my girlfriend to accompany the laptop i got her for christmas she wanted a case that would match the skin tight fit of my mac and the incase that i have i was skeptical at first as to whether it would fit or not , but when she got it , its fits perfectly with very little room to slide around it 's not a second skin like my incase but its pretty darn close i also got her <unk> wireless mobile mouse # - <unk> go along with it and that fits nicely in the pockets in the front along with her charger it was a perfect gift and she loves it
this sleeve fits an hp mini # w / # -cell battery ok but only if the mini is inserted battery first there are no external pockets and the fit is very tight it might be possible to stretch the sleeve enough to stuff in the ac adapter cord , at risk of maybe scratching the mini , but i 'm hesitant to try the sleeve has just enough padding to protect against incidental cosmetic scratches , not enough in my opinion to protect against a hard drop or knock in summary , this is a `` soft protective sleeve `` with no significant storage for any accessories thicker than a piece of paper design is pink on black
the case is a perfect fit for my hp mini but i agree with the other reviewer - it does fit the larger battery , but would be even better if there was maybe an outside pocket for the power cord , and/or my wireless mouse otherwise , it 's great protection , i can charge it by only leaving the zipper open a bit , all soft and fuzzy inside , and a nice case overall certainly looks great with my pink mini too
i bought my hp with the bigger battery this case fits nicely i just wish that it was a little roomier and would fit the power cord within overall i am pleased with this product
good little notebook sleeve even with the six cell battery on my hp mini # that sticks out , the case stretches enough to allow it to fit would be nice if it had a small carry handle serves it 's purpose well in protecting the net netbook my wife likes the graphic design
my laptop never looked so good before <unk> from it 's case it 's slim enough to put in a backpack but thick enough to keep it safe there is n't room anywhere for the charger or accessories , but that 's really not a big deal <unk> are for portability , you know ? :
i bought this for my hp mini computer i was having trouble finding something small enough , and this is just right its a bonus that it has an attractive design
<unk> but not for protecting your computer from falls this case sleeve has no support cute or carrying your computer but if you want protection this is not the sleeve for you
i ca n't read and got a bag <unk> to small so that sucks not worth returning since it was so cheap so i gave it to my sister and she used it for her bamboo tablet thingy
i got this case to cover my mac it is very cute and fuzzy the downfall is that there is n't a lot of padding there is hardly any at all
i was expecting more comfy case but this is kinda thin . idk if this can protect my macbook if i drop it , but i never dropped it so idk . but its ok to use
satisfied with this product but would have liked it to have a pocket for cord when i travel the animal skin look is what i wanted to fit my style
i really like this case it has a cute design and it 's soft i use it for my macbook pro # . # `` and it fits well i thought the padding would be a little thicker it 's fine , i was just hoping for a little more cushion i 'm thinking about getting a hard shell case for it know for the little more protection i 'm looking for
i can not even tell you how much i love the look of this case , it is so cute im usually a bigger fan of zebra than leopard , but im really happy i went with this pattern and it probably holds up to stains much better than the zebra i get comments on it all the time and could not be happier with the appearance it also fits my # `` macbook pro perfectly and i like that the zipper goes around the sides of the laptop , not just one side that being said , the only thing it really protects from is scratches , a substantial drop would probably still harm your laptop however , the case came with a piece of foam that i continue to keep inside with my laptop now for added protection overall , great , extremely fashionable case
i wanted a nice leopard ipad cover and guess what ... that is just what i got the zipper works easily , it is nice and cushy and protects my ipad and best of all ... it is leopard nice case , i just ordered another one for my macbook pro , so that says a lot
i love my leopard macbook # inch case it fit perfectly the leopard is really soft and is super cute and does n't look cheap either it 's so easy to slip my macbook in and out of
i wanted a cute case for my new # in macbook , but did n't . want to pay the $ # or so that best buy charges well , this case fit the bill perfectly fast shipping , awesome design , durable , and it fits my macbook even with a hard cover on it i wish it could hold my charger also though
we bought this for our # year old for christmas to hold her new mac air and she is in love with it it 's lightweight , the zipper <unk> smoothly and it 's the perfect size for her new computer this was a great purchase
holds my mac nice and tight i already have my mac in a case so i just brought this to keep it safe from the rain in my open purse not really to protect the computer , but i absolutely love it
it 's cute and exactly as i expected do n't expect it to be super soft or fluffy or anything along those lines but it is exactly what it 's titled as it also doubles as a cat bed because every time i leave it laying around i find my cat <unk> up on top of it , she loves it
i love this cute and functional laptop sleeve my new macbook pro # `` fits snugly inside and there are no worries of it sliding around the zipper seems to function smoothly so far , and opens wide enough to allow easy access both in and out decorative zipper pull makes it easy to grip and zip the exterior is a velvety <unk> faux fur which prevents slipping when holding on to it , and the inside is a soft black neoprene to provide a bit of padding and prevent any scratches or damages to the computer the case appears <unk> and it 's also very lightweight fits nicely inside my larger tote bag
i was looking for a case for my macbook for a while and when i came across this i was thrilled it 's so cute and furry if you love animal print , you will love this product i get so many compliments about it when im out with it it also fits perfectly over my pink macbook pro hardshell case which is so great the case came very quick i 'm so pleased
i wanted a leopard print laptop case and that is what i got i received a lot of compliments , its really cute and <unk> change from tradition solid color cases
this case is not very good with regards to functionality and durability -lrb- i got this case in black -rrb- the front compartment could barely accommodate the ac adapter/charger for my hp mini # netbook and the corner of the bag somehow got torn with very light usage after a year get the caselogic <unk> # . # -inch netbook case which i just got that is much better than the kroo
i got this for my samsung nc- # netbook it serves it 's purpose nicely however , the netbook never makes it to the case , but i have it if i need it !
this little blue netbook case is better than i had expected i love the design , the internal compartments , the ease of access and the appearance of the bag i very much recommend it as a product of good value and besides , it is so cute
was a little worried based on other netbook case reviews that it would n't fit my acer but it worked great only thing i wold improve on is a bigger outside pocket for the cord . . it fits , but a little snug with my portable mouse otherwise i have no complaints would n't mind if it came in more colors though
i like the size of the case , and the external pocket , but in the end , i refused to own a case that increased the weight of my netbook by # % i got a netbook for the portability on my kitchen scale , this case came in just under a pound that 's too much for a # . # pound netbook , so i returned it i ended up buying a belkin case at target that weighs just half of what this case weighs i searched on amazon for that case so i could recommend it , but i can not find it for sale anywhere online
this is a handy carring case for a # `` netbook the side pocket allows extra space for things like a mouse the case is sturdy and the handle is strong for carring it like a small <unk>
i bought this case for my ipad , and it looks like it will be just fine for that purpose it fits perfectly under the internal strap , especially with the belkin grip groove case the sides and corners have enough armor to make me comfortable carrying it out and about the internal and external pockets will be good for various items i 'm not sure what the clear plastic pouch inside the case is for - maybe to carry four sd cards two things would make this case perfect # -rrb- shoulder strap # -rrb- some way to use it as an ipad stand - something as simple as a plastic piece to hook the hand straps together would do it i can probably fashion something for it bottom line : excellent case for the price
my netbook fits snuggly inside only draw back is that even though you may have pockets inside , you ca n't really put things other than the netbook because it will be too bulky and really a tight fit the pocket outside fits my charger , cables and usb perfectly
just like all the other reviews said , product is sturdy , semi-hard shell design it makes me really confident that it will properly protect my laptop from minor drops and bumps outside pouch is def roomy enough for chargers and a mouse much more convenient than just a netbook sleeve
i ordered this product based on other reviews and the low price and i am <unk> surprised by the quality the case has a semi hard shell that i was excited about since this is more protection for my netbook then just a fabric case my dell netbook fits comfortably inside there is a storage pocket on the inside -lrb- probably more useful for papers -rrb- and on the outside -lrb- which fits my larger ac adaptor and an average size mouse comfortably if you were to carry the netbook in the case only , it sort of reminds me of a bible case but thinner all in all , i would say that this is an excellent purchase especially given the price
i wanted a hard case to fit my nook color in while still keeping the ereader in it 's cover as well but i wanted a case that had either a front zipper pocket or front velcro pocket to fit the charger and usb cable in it as well at the same time while i travel while this is not really a `` hard `` case , it is stiff and protects the ereader nicely i have zero complaints i highly recommend this item until barnes and noble or someone else can come up with a travel case similar to this for the nook color , this is definitely the way to go
this case is very durable and fits my netbook perfectly plus the pocket on the outside is the perfect size for my power cord and mouse that i carry around with it
it 's just a little bigger than it needs to be to fit my # . # `` acer it is n't a `` hard `` case in the sense that it 's not rigid plastic , but it 's not a flimsy piece of foam either all in all , a lot better protection for my netbook than your average sleeve build quality seems very good and the pocket on the outside is sized nicely for my power supply too ordering another for a friend who fell in love with it at first sight
if you want a small case with handles and a pocket for your charger , cord , mouse , etc . this case will handle your needs it is well built and works well
i ordered this for my # inch <unk> shake acer aspire happy one it is perfect it is well protected in this hard case convenient to carry with the handles the outer pocket is roomy ... great for the power cord & plug inside the case has a soft velcro strap on one side & a mesh pocket that is large and covers the entire inside case on the other side also on the inside are some nice little <unk> pockets meant to hold little square media cards ... nice touch well constructed ... so glad i purchased
i bought this for my # yr old daughters new netbook she got for christmas and it 's nice the only problem i have with it is because it 's such a light pink , dirt shows up very easily from the picture i thought it was a different material that could be wiped off easily but it 's not will have to eventually get her a different one since this one is dirty already
i love my case the only issue is that i really wanted it in pink the vendor emailed me saying they would n't have pink available i got the silver but when you want pink , nothing else will be perfect love the pocket perfect for holding the chord and a mouse there was room inside to put a mousepad and there are holders for media cards it 's got a sturdy outer shell to help cushion the netbook and inside strap to hold it in place
