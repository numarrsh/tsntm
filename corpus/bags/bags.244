i ordered the purple color , which came exactly like the picture , and is gorgeous the kickstands on the underneath are pretty handy and the cover fit perfectly no complaints here
had this shell for about a month it fits perfectly and does n't add much weight or girth to the macbook love it ... however i do not use the keypad cover due to the air <unk> needs of the computer
i enjoy having a case on my mac it snaps on easy , it 's bright & it elevates with the stand underneath it for easier typing it was well worth it
this was easy to install , fit perfectly and the purple is my favorite shade it even matches my cell phone case i especially like the flip out feet on the bottom that allow you to see the screen better it has plenty of venting so my computer does n't overheat the price is half of what apple charges at their retail store i love my case and get complimented daily
color is true , fits well and will be a welcome addition to my other colors i choose this company because they are always on the money with fit , color and product however , the only gripe i have ... the free skins never fit my keyboard - they are too big but , i order different ones
i love this purple macbook case it is still on my computer after almost # months after purchasing it and i still love it the color makes everything pop while also protecting my macbook pro it is easy to assemble -lrb- # seconds -rrb- and is very durable as i have unfortunately tested it now when i take the case off , my computer just is n't as pretty so i put it right back on
i love my new purple mcover it also came with a cute purple keyboard cover i am very pleased it does exactly what it is supposed to , protects my macbook pro from scratches and gives my macbook pro a cute look the price matches what you receive so i believe it is a good value i look forward to ordering more items from this company <unk> the future
i just bought a # `` macbook pro and needed a cute case i took the chance and bought the purple case cover and it fits perfectly on my mac it looks super cute my only thing is that its plastic and i wanted more of a shiny look to it
the top part of this cover did not work , it is loose and immediately falls off the top the bottom part of the cover works well , and is useful however , there is only one usable part of it this was wasted money
i bought this product for two simple reasons : # -rrb- to elevate the keyboard for better typing angles and # -rrb- for the feet to prevent the laptop from sliding about within days of having the case , the glue used to hold the feet in place melted from the excess heat produced by having the case on the computer if that was n't bad enough , the pop-up legs on the back broke off while i was typing a few weeks later what a piece of garbage now it just makes both me and my computer blue . : -
thought it was gon na be great for my macbook pro based on the reviews but it sucks made a weird noise and scratched my computer a bit i recommend to get a kuzy case instead those are # times better than this crap
it did not fit my macbook pro i had to return it the cover was too small my apple laptop is three years old , and still works perfectly , and i love it i have no desire to replace it at this time i even went to an apple store and they said they did n't carry a cover for that laptop because it was old
the large holes on the bottom allow particles to enter and get stuck which leaves scratches on the laptop i did n't realize this till i took the case off and there was a ton of dirt in which some did n't come off -lrb- those were the scratches -rrb- the holes under the cover is unnecessary because the vents are n't even on the bottom of the laptop if you would like to protect your investment , please do not buy this product
i appreciate the <unk> of the seller that he refunded my money after consulting with him my <unk> as far as the condition of delivered product it was good doing business with you because you are a good <unk> to your customer
the color is vibrant , but it is actually # . # inches in size , different from the # inches that it is advertised as this cover is too big . and does not usable
i got the case and it was fine but a couple weeks later the two items that can tilt the computer off broke also the four holders broke off as well . i would not recommend this to anyone if i could buy one all over again i would go with a speck case
was difficult to find the case that fit my computer be careful to order the correct one and match model numbers if you order the wrong one , it will cost you to return it i would have to pay more in shipping costs to return it than what i actually paid for it
the case does not snap on very well it is made of very cheap plastic with no special <unk> to it dirt particles get stuck between the case and cause scratches
it got the job done , but i prefer a cover that is more rubbery than this it made it simply feel more cheap there are better out there for a similar
bottom cover loose at the back corners gravity alone holding macbook in place when case is open it does not hold laptop into place macbook rocks when set upon a level surface with the cover 's `` legs `` folded up seems more stable when the legs are down , but surprisingly rickety bottom of macbook does not sit tight against the bottom cover can not tell if this is a design choice or a molding <unk> honestly , surprised at the number of positive reviews given what i see in my hands i can only guess there are some qc issues
it 's a good case possibly a bit too much space between the top cover and the back of the screen the rubber feet fell off after a couple of months of tough use it 's pretty good and you do n't spend $ # for a brand name
it protects it , but the top cover doesnt fit it well sometimes when opening lid it will feel like its coming off no i do not have it on the wrong way , its just cheap ... spend # more and get a better quality
this macbook pro shell case color is beautiful but the problem is both back & bottom are little loose you can notice when you are holding it anyway its okay for me besides i do n't really carry my macbook item delivered the next day a + +
this is a great case for my macbook pro # inch it adds style and <unk> to my macbook pro my only problem with it is that the rubber things at the bottom of this came off really easily and i never received the free keyboard cover with this case i 'm a little disappointed that i never got the free keyboard cover and i have had this case for nearly # years if i could somehow get the keyboard cover that would be greatly appreciated
my daughter loves this case for # reasons : it 's purple , it has a free cover for the keyboard , and it has & # # ; feet & # # ; to prop it up as for me -lrb- dad -rrb- , it looks nice , but it 's already chipped in a few places -lrb- only a month of use -rrb- and will probably need to be replaced before the year is out all in all , buy it for style , not protection
not only was it not what i wanted , but the description was not accurate either it was supposedly for an a # but it did n't fit an a # they accepted the return and refunded my money , but i am left without a cover , because no one actually carried the cover for this older apple macbook deception , accidental or not , is no fun
this was the first cover i bought for my mbp it 's a great color and the blue hard shell is both attractive and protective however , the cover does fit loosely enough that grit easily falls between the case and the mbp my laptop was quickly scratched by the cover i ended up quickly buying a rubberized case instead this is a nice , attractive case -- but beware , it will scratch your laptop
good protection for my macbook pro comes with optional keyboard thin film plastic cover in case of a spill and just to keep dirt and finger prints away over time the constant touching gets the keys dirty - this prevents it fast delivery too
i bought this for my brand new macbook pro , and i love it the colors are so vibrant i love the retractable feet for better air circulation , i 'm always afraid my computer will overheat since that was a common problem with my old pc my only qualm is that they shipped it to a different address than i hoped they would , and it was kind of a pain , but that has nothing to do with the great product great for keeping your macbook safe and scratch free the keyboard cover is awesome too it prevents small objects or liquids from getting into the keyboard and damaging the electronics inside overall great products
i bought this case just before traveling for the first time with my mac book pro i wanted something that made it more unique taking it out of my backpack at security as well as protect the finish against the elements it surpassed all my expectations in almost every capacity i love the deep blue color and like that i have access to all the ports along the sides as well as the bright white of the apple logo on the back the one drawback is none of the cable security devices i tried worked with the case the slot is too close to one of the edges of the case making it impossible for the lock to enter all the way it 's not a deal-breaker i can always take the case off when in a strange hotel room but it would have been nice not to have to resort to that all in all a nice looking , well-made , protective case that does as it advertises
was very easy to snap onto macbook keyboard cover is challenging to get use to , but that is a minor personal detail very pleased with the product , thinking about ordering another one
this is a nice cover that protects my computer ca n't say if it would protect it if it fell , as luckily that has n't happened parts are sturdy , and it seems to vent well the legs are n't adjustable , just one height for me , a little to high , so i do n't use them
it came with a huge scratch on the cover -lrb- bought it used -rrb- , but it was n't that noticeable , so i did n't return it overall , it protects my computer and it 's cute . ;
seller was very easy to work with and product arrived on time , my only complaint was that the material that the cover was made of rubs off a little and does n't always look very clean
it does exactly what i wanted it to do it snapped on easily i love the bright translucent color i know i 'll have to be careful with the feet , but i love that having them out keeps my computer much cooler
works well . . the free keyboard cover seems to slip off easily , so i do n't use it other than that , the shell looks good and does it 's job protecting my macbook i would 've given it # stars if it had a rubber coating
the color of the case is exactly like the picture the top of the case fits perfect and looks nice the bottom half of the case is great because it lets the computer stay cool , however , the back corners of the case seem to not fit like the top it seems just a little lose but still stays on the computer also the stands you use to life the laptop up for cooling seem low quality like they could break easily overall nice case i would recommend it
easy to install and it does not limit the opening of the laptop i 'd have given it # stars if instead of little legs , which are uncomfortable on <unk> , it had a fold down bar the width of the case otherwise great and a fair price
this is grate and fits snug on my mac the only probably i have with it is the two little rubber feet at the bottom they came off and i had to <unk> them back
bought this product to protect the two mac book pro that my kids own this is nice and durable only issue is that the actual product color differs from how it looks in the picture so the kids complained about that
i got this a couple of months ago to protect a brand new macbook pro i am very particular about keeping my equipment in mint condition while using it as much as possible the construction is pretty solid , it is a good fit , not bulky and so far it protected the top of my macbook from being scratched up ! it has an open construction on the bottom so it can breath and it has two adjustable little feet at the bottom to elevate the keyboard
easy to put on covers well except bottom where it 's open for heat release looks like it will protect for the most part bought for my kids who wanted cover to protect apple computer like the color , too all openings for cables are available just as they would be without the cover
great bang for your buck cheap and it protects my mac pretty well i love the kickstand feature , overheating was a big problem but not so much anymore also the bottom part of the case is very open which also keeps my mac from overheating i do n't think it will protect anything if i were to drop it , but that is not an issue of mine i bought this to keep the corners from chipping and to keep the scratches off so far , this case has pleased me and met my requirements of keeping superficial marks away
this case went on easily and overall i feel will protect the laptop issued to me by my place of business the only concern i have is that the clips on the lid on the front where i lift it to open it do not work it seems to lift a little when i open the computer each time not sure how long the cover will last at this rate
this case has served its purpose by protecting my mbp twice from falls i just have two complaints the perfect fit is just not there seems to me that the top shell needs a better adjustment ; take a look at the -lrb- sp ** k -rrb- competing products one major complaint is that on one side the bottom part of the shell ends too close to the kensington lock slot preventing most locks from <unk> properly ; i 've already tried three <unk> products without success if those two issues were to be corrected it would make it a perfect product , but for the price , it ca n't be beaten
the cover is wonderful , i love it but the free keyboard cover has two issues : # -rrb- it takes time to get used to typing on it i keep making typos when i type at my usual speed -lrb- fast ! -rrb- # -rrb- the color on the space tab is already wearing off -lrb- within a few weeks # and so it no longer looks clean and nice
the shell case is working just fine , the only problem i have is with the keyboard cover as soon as i put the cover on and close my laptop , as soon as i open it , the cover is attached to the screen did n't want to deal with it over and over , so i do n't use the cover at all
fits well , and does its job i lost one of the feet that helps prop it up within two weeks , as i travel for work and the computer goes in and out of my backpack constantly something to watch out for
i first bought a blue one and liked it enough that i bought a second clear one for someone else the price was better than other brands and it is well made
i love the seller 's <unk> as i originally bought a case for a macbook pro not the macbook and they said to send it in for a replacement i was <unk> , quick service and wonderful product with cool stand and rubber grips thanks ipearl for a wonderful case
i just purchased this new cover i love the color and durability , but compared to my older cover it is quite ` slippery ' . i have to be more careful carrying or moving my mac i was used to it being more rubbery and gripping better it does have some rubberized feet that help on <unk> and desks
this case is the best i 've found for a mbp i 'm on my # rd intel macbook pro so i went straight here to get a case the feet get loose after a while , but i do n't use them much , so a dab of super glue will keep them closed
arrived on time arrived in perfect condition had no problem using the product my only complain is that after awhile , the little black sticky things that keep it from sliding around start to come loose
this item looks great and does a good job of protecting my mac book pro but it really does n't fit the body too well and i had to cut away plastic from the case surrounding the power connector because it could n't make enough contact to charge my mac book pro great product over all needs some fine <unk>
i got this a couple weeks ago but had to return it because it didnt fit my laptop , even though the measurements were the same when i looked the case over i realized there were slots for button i didnt have on the sides of my laptop the case itself is exactly what i ordered and it arrived sooner than estimated the only problem was a user error -lrb- my part -rrb- in that i didnt check to be sure that i had the right laptop case for my laptop im guessing now that the case is for the new mac laptop , but i have the old one -lrb- or the other way around , im not sure -rrb- check what laptop you have before ordering
the case is a case , nothing unique i bought the cover as a gift for my brother i was expecting the cover to be shiny and have more of a leathery look instead , the cover is matte looking it basically just looks like plastic but is shipped on time , and was easy to set up the stand works just personal preference if you want a smooth glossy cover or a matte strong thick cover
i bought this case several days ago , and so far it is adequate to protect the outer cover of my macbook pro my only grievance -lrb- and it 's a small one -rrb- is that the front rubber stubs have come off after a couple of days , and are lost but overall , this is a lot better than not having a cover at all
i only gave it # out of # because , fortunately , i have n't had to test it if i drop my computer several times , i 'll log back on and let you know how it held up , but so far , so good
i love the case and i can tell will protect my macbook very well however , the price keeps switching between # . # and # . # i happened to have it in my cart when it was # . # but got charged # . # so i feel like i kind of got ripped off on that one the keyboard is also just a clear keyboard cover i was expecting it to be in blue like the case but it was n't the keyboard cover also does n't fit very nicely , i would recommend getting a keyboard cover other then the one they provide i 'm very pleased with the case but that 's the only reason i 'd give it four
after ordering the blue case for my macbook pro , i received it promptly it was very easy to put on ! love the color and love the look of it
i bought this case about a month ago after i got my new macbook pro the case is nice and i really love the brilliant colors that ipearl has to offer the only problem that i have found with the case is that the two rubber feet on the front -lrb- bottom of case -rrb- , seem to fall off very easily as it has happen to me twice already the back feet pop out for a raised keyboard effect however i never use them due to a strong fear that they will just snap to those looking a this case understand that overall this case is amazing , the feet are the only draw backs i have found to the case
love the color easy to snap on you can still see the apple logo when it lights up -lrb- i like that -rrb- most of all , it makes my laptop feel safe : #
i bought this case to protect my mac from dents , and it does the job perfectly i love this color blue as well it does make the computer a tiny bit thicker , but i do n't mind because my computer bag has some extra space to fit it in perfectly at this price , you ca n't beat it
for $ # this a good piece of plastic well , at least when you compare to what stuff costs at the apple store i was a little concerned when mine arrived as it appeared slightly warped but , it snapped right on and i have n't had any problems with it snapping off as some others have mentioned the bottom is ugly and i 'm not sure if the design serves any real purpose for cooling since i do n't see any vents it is an aluminum case though , so maybe for cooling purposes -lrb- doubt it -rrb- but , really , how often do you or anyone else look at the bottom of your laptop this serves its purpose to help protect your laptop , and the top looks nice
i purchased this case for my son for his new mac and he loves it the color and the fit is perfect we recieved it very fast and in new condition just as <unk> i would definately order from seller again
this cover fits well with a quick click the color is bright and since everyone in my school has the same laptop , it makes it easy to pick mine out at a meeting to be honest , i 'm not a fan of the keyboard cover , i do n't think it fits well i ordered a bundle of # semi transparent colorful keyboard silicone cover skin protectors from the friendly <unk> and they fit much better , but hey , i bought the case , the cover was just an add in i will probably not use it and i do n't even like it enough to gift it to someone else i may keep it for a <unk> student who has to use the school 's laptops
this case does not fall apart like some of the others it is a beautiful blue and the keyboard cover is a beautiful teal blue that looks great with the case
this case is very nice it snaps onto and pops off of the laptop with ease , the <unk> tabs make a more comfortable angle for some people to type on , and , best of all , obviously it protects the laptop
i use this every day and it is absolutely wonderful it is a perfect royal blue that lets the apple shine brightly through - i use it on stage as i lead <unk> and it looks professional
lets face it , a macbook is an investment and it 's a beautiful bit of kit i wanted to protect the laptop and apple had similar shells on their website and wanted nearly # times as much for what was basically the something then i say this shell , the price was right and she it arrived i have to admit i was pleasantly surprised it was simple to install , did not add to the overall size of my mac and it feels solid i would suggest this to anyone that wants to protect and/or dress up their macbook
easy to apply to your computer -lrb- just snaps right on -rrb- , good protection , looks good includes a thin rubber keyboard protector too -lrb- which i prefer not to use as i type very fast and my fingers <unk> across the keys and sometimes get caught on the rubber cover -rrb- the rubber key protector is thin and easily manageable but does add just a bit of resistance if you hit a key <unk>
unbelievable that i had paid # bucks for the same thing so dumb sometimes stores make you this product is really protecting my macbook pro nicely it has vent holes at the bottom in addition to the <unk> at the back cool colors too
i love the color it still allows for the apple to shine through and snaps pretty easily on to both the top and bottom parts of the laptop i was hesitant after reading reviews of not fitting properly , but i matched the model of my laptop to the description and it fits perfectly the keyboard cover takes a little getting used to , but it does keep crumbs and dust from falling in between the keys and it looks nice does <unk> the sound the keys make overall , i am satisfied with my purchase
this case , -lrb- mines the dark blue -rrb- is a must for the macbook , - it fits the computer snug and i like the `` stand `` feature that is built into it with the new design of the macbook pro , this case protects from external scratches and i think enhances the look of the computer i would highly recommend this product it also allows for seamless access to all ports on the mac get it , you wo n't be sorry
the blue color looks good protects my laptop the apple logo still shines though a little disappointed in the quality of the keyboard cover , but since it was free i didnt take away a star
as i have used a more expensive competitor 's case previously i can say that this is how a hard case should be built i love the ease of install and combined with the great looks , this case is a must have ! i really like the feet on the bottom which make typing a breeze
my entire class has different colors of these and they are great if you carry your computer around a lot they really help protect it from getting scratched up . very easy to put on and take off . stays attached incredibly well i would recommend it to anyone
my wife and i absolutely love our mcovers for our new macbook pro # laptop since the body is made from aluminum we were very concerned of them being dented or scratched now with the cool looking mcover we do n't have to worry about that plus it gives us some <unk> with having really cool colors they were simple to install and easy to use ! ! check it out at blue mcover hard shell case for # . # `` a # aluminum unibody macbook pro # -inch -lrb- model # a # with black keyboard
cover fits perfectly it came with a semi translucent colorless silicone keyboard cover the little feet helps to elevate the rear of the macbook allowing more circulation for the fan it was very easy to install i like it a lot
the case shipped really fast , and was just as pictured on the <unk> i was pleased to find a couple of feet to tilt the laptop forward for better viewing the case fits perfectly , but make sure to get all the tabs snapped into place once the case is on , there are no gaps and could n't fit any better , it is a snug fit i ca n't imagine why everyone would n't love this product
i really like this case for my macbook ! fits well , easy to install , the added keyboard protector was a nice touch . and it looks cute , like the pictures . great for the price
i wanted to protect my new macbook pro without adding bulk or weight this case definitely fits the bill and is a beautiful color as well i also felt the price was much more reasonable than other cases and it seems to be of good quality glad i purchased from amazon and saved some money and shipping was pretty quick even with super saver shipping
i ordered this along with my brand new macbookpro # `` this past august i was a little worried when i got it that it would be too flimsy but it has truly held up great its a little on the dark side , so if you 're girly type it may come across as manly or <unk> but as a girl who loves blue its perfect the best part ever are the kick stands , best idea ever great price , what else can you ask
i bought this hard case for my macbook air about two weeks ago it 's great ! very easy to install and a great protector from scratches , spills , and general bad treatment this is the second one i have purchased in the last two years , and i 'm very happy with it it gives great protection and also gives my computer a great look from the original brushed silver cover this seller is great also -- i got <unk> delivery and an excellent price ! i could n't be more happy with my purchase i would definitely buy from them again if i ever need another one or i get a different computer !
i had a similar product before , made by a different company of a different color my computer fell off of a coffee table and the bottom cover cracked on the side after that , it would hardly stay on , so i purchase this royal blue case as of now , i 've only used the bottom part since it was replacing the broken one this one is great as there are many holes on the bottom , allowing more air circulation and cooling off of the computer there are two retractable feet on the bottom that may be used to stand the computer up at an angle , but i have not used these , nor plan to the color is as pictured -lrb- if not , more blue than <unk> looking -rrb- i have the # in macbook pro -lrb- purchased in # -rrb- and it fits great i would absolutely recommend this product
i got this cover for my macbook this semester , and i love it the little feet on the bottom are great to help keep the computer cool other cases i have had in the past crack , or chip , not this one i love this case one of the best purchases i 've made
snaps on easily and stays on it 's a great cover and is the right price they sell these things at the apple store for double the price and it 's the same thing i would definitely recommend
i purchased the ipearl case approximately four months ago to protect my new macbook very pleased so far with the case 's form and function : it protects the laptop and looks very cool in its royal blue color , complete with apple logo shining through the translucent case it 's also easier to carry the laptop without slipping because the case adds <unk> texture to the mac 's slick surface the case is holding up very well so far i especially like the accompanying color-coordinated keyboard cover was n't sure i 'd bother with it at first , but it does a great job of protecting the keys and is easy to type on
i bought this set for my new laptop after i noticed that it was quickly getting scratched up i did ask for or want the keyboard protector but i tried it i left it on because it felt cool to type on the cover i am so glad that i did try it a couple weeks after i covered my keyboard , i accidentally spilt an entire cup of coffee with cream and <unk> on the keyboard as i turned the computer over beige coffee ran out after removing the keyboard cover i was delighted to discover that my keyboard was completely unharmed and the cover cleaned up perfectly thank you keyboard cover
i received the case very quickly and am very happy with it the royal blue color is beautiful , it was so easy to put on -lrb- it literally took just a few minutes -rrb- , and it protects my macbook like i wanted it to i would definitely recommend this case and company to a friend
this is the first time i have order from this company and i love this mac book cover i love that it has feet on the bottom of the cover that allows my macbook to air out and not overheat if i ever need another cover i will definitely remember this company
it 's simple that macbook cost too much to let go unprotected i bought two of these , one for my wife and one for me does a great job without spending a lot of money trust me , you need one
the product fits like a glove definitely worth the cost the lowest price , here on amazon.com this would be the ticket , if you 're trying to protect the outer cover of your macbook pro
i got # of them today in the mail i got the blue case and the red case they are both stunning on my macbook pro it also comes with a keyboard cover ! ! i am looking to order a green one as well . # stars if i could ! ! ! ! order one of these they are cheap , durable , and look great ! !
this case does an amazing job protecting your mbp from scratches also , the feet really improve the comfort level when it comes to working on a laptop i noticed that my mbp runs cooler when using the feet at # bucks this case is a steal
for anyone reading the negative reviews below me , please ignore them this product was the perfect color of blue , exactly as described i would recommend this to any friend or person close to me it snaps on easily and keeps my laptop clean and scratch free i have a macbook pro , and i have seen people that have not bought a case needless to say , it is nice knowing that my laptop will be scratch free i would highly recommend this to anyone that currently owns or will in future own a # inch macbook pro
the cover fits perfectly on the macbook pro & does n't add any bulk to it like the color and it arrived within # days of placing my order i recommend this product for all macbook pro owners
wonderful hard case i bought one in clear , red , green , blue and purple ; for my kids and wife guess who i forgot to get one for , you got it , me going to change that now the colors are rich not pale easy to put on , a little harder to take off this and the keyboard cover are a great way to protect your laptop another plus are the legs , they elevate the back of the laptop for better cooling and give my hands a better angle at the keyboard make sure you order the one for your model , in this case # . # `` a # macbook pro i believe they make one for every macbook and macbook pro model
worth the money i have n't had any problems with this so far and i love the fact that it has little legs to prop it up much better than the one i used to have
super fast shipping item as described i bought this for my son and he loves it fits perfectly and he loves the color i would buy this item again
