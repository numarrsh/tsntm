this is a very nice case for holding my # inch portable dvd player it holds all the cables , my sons earphones , plus has a holder for several dvds however , unless you have a very large backseat , it 's not useful for hooking to the back of the seat for watching if i do that , it basically sits right in my son 's lap -- not good , as he then wants to mess with all the dvd controls so i use it only as a very handy carrying case
this case is really nice it 's fits my # portable dvd player and has a pretty hard shell so it keeps it from being damaged i found the same case in walmart for half the price you may want to shop around your local stores
this product is the one they have up at best buy i wanted to show my wife i could save us money and get it here really fast we did both it could have been my truck but the straps that go around the driver and passenger head rest were n't really the best way to set it up we ended up attaching it around the middle console vs around the driver and pass . seats works great good size for # `` screen
the case is of nice appearance , it 's not <unk> to carry the straps are quite long so you have no problem wrapping them around headrest and we found it sturdy the quality is extremely good for the price there was only one thing it did n't have and was meant to was the external ear jack other than that it met our needs
ordered two of these for grandchildren for christmas to keep their dvd players in they are good size and seem to be sturdy but the zipper sticks and you really have to work it to get it opened or closed
we use this case all the time for our # in dvd player it is a good size and we fit a number of movies in there along with the straps i would n't recommend using this as a holder in the car though the player does n't sit easily for good viewing
a good case to store my portable dvd players a little big , but it allows for storage of some dvd 's too if it is on sale , i would recommend it
i was looking for a case for my portable # `` sony blu-ray player and this seemed to fit the bill the case itself is well made and has plenty of extra storage , in fact almost too much extra space i could almost fit # of my devices in this case the straps are functional and allow numerous options for attaching the case in a vehicle , which is nice check the measurements carefully if you are looking for a somewhat large portable <unk> player case , than this is a good choice if , however , you want something that fits your player a little more snugly , than you may want something else
had it been in a prettier color i would give it a # star great product works well and is very conventional hard case and come with a very nice set up and extra pieces recommend it if you carry your portable dvd player in the car
i have been looking for a case to fit my # . # `` insignia portable dvd player -lrb- insignia is the best buy brand -rrb- strangely enough , best buy did not sell a case that fit this player , so i had to look elsewhere my local target and walmart cases did not fit -lrb- the dvd cases were too small and the laptop computer cases were too big -rrb- this case fits my player perfectly there is even a little bit of room to spare , but not much the case has two compartments : # side for the dvd player and # side for dvds and cords i have not tried to mount this in the car since this is n't the reason i bought the case -lrb- but might be a nice perk -rrb- overall , i 'm very satisfied
i like this case because its versatile ; you can hang behind chair or hang suspended in between <unk> the only cons -lrb- - # star -rrb- is that it a little big for my player and it doesnt have side pockets for <unk> , adapter/charger overall its good
perfect for traveling with and storing my headphones , charger and extra movies very good case for the airport carried it on but was able to watch movies on the plane using my headphones handy to have everything in one bag
better and cheaper then ones that i could find <unk> my # yr old will use this for his portable dvd player , easy to use and lots of storage
this is a perfect case for my new sony # inch dvd player hard shell , roomy enough for cords , cables and a few accessories i love it as i do all my other case logic products everything should be so good
this is a very good product which looks great and works very well as a case i would not like to try to mount this on my seats as a display for the dvd player looks very tedious , but may work i just have no need to mount it in my car it does come with # straps for mounting the unit and it holds all the accessories that comes with your player it even has a pocket that holds # discs in individual slots i am glad i got this one it fits my sony <unk> # perfectly
i bought this item through amazon , shipped by accessory <unk> this case is perfect size for the asus laptop there is ample room for the battery charger + power cord , along with dvd 's / cd 's , and my full size logitech trackball mouse this case zips on two sides very well made , sturdy , with lots of padding , but remains small
it is exactly what i wanted the projector fits neatly and tightly in the case it is easy to use it also holds extra cd 's and an extension cord
this case is very functional and should last a long time we have not used it outside the house as yet but the grandson says i made a great choice
this case is an outstanding case for my portable dvd player it also has slots to bring a selection of dvds along for flying very convenient and said case seems to be rugged and protective thank you for a fine product
great protection for dvd player very convenient for viewing while traveling in the car our daughter loves it , and so do we big help to eliminate the & # # ; are we there yet ? & # # ; questions
bought the case logic for my # granddaughters for christmas so they could store their extra dvd 's along with the cords to charge their dvd players it is just the perfect size and very sturdy should last for a long time even through the abuse of a # year old
the case is very handy for organizing my grandson 's dvd 's for a trip in the car we like the way we can attach the case to the back of the front seats so he <unk> his movie
i got this case for my # in portable dvd player ! it 's very roomy and has a lot of space it also has capability to attach it in the car i do not need that it 's a great case for going places
i bought this product for my # inch asus netbook and it fits perfectly there 's even a pouch in the second compartment the almost seems as though it was designed to hold a portable hard drive provides great protection with padding on every side
i am soooo glad i made this purchase as everything that came with the player fit perfectly in the bag it is very study and it came with instructions on how to set it up for one person to view it in the car or for two how to set it up between the seats it also came with straps for one or two seats i am very very pleased with this purchase ! !
i bought this player case because i have one just like it for another dvd player and love it i would recommend it for anyone that needs a case , it has enough room for all the extra items on one side and the dvd player on the other , and it really looks great too
this case is well constructed there are two zippered compartments i use one for the portable dvd player i bought the other compartment has a mesh pocket that is perfect for a kindle
i got this to store the various bluetooth speakers i have it fits everything perfectly and securely the bose <unk> # fits here perfectly now i can transport them safely with space to spare
bought this product to transport the portable dvd for my wife it has lots of room , nooks for storing cords , etc . it has a <unk> front to protect the unit it is light weight and we are very pleased with the cost and unit i would buy again
this arrived in a large box w/ # other items i had ordered one day it arrived in perfect condition this is a gift for my daughter to keep her new <unk> free dvd player in
sturdy , well padded , but attractive case at a reasonable price fits my new # `` portable dvd player perfectly has extra zippered storage compartment for cords , remote , and a few dvds great for use in the car also to keep the kids <unk> on long trips super fast customer service and delivery
holds the dvd player , movies , cords , and headphones in an organized manner overall very happy with the purchase , much better than the case that came with the <unk> 's portable dvd player
this case is handsome , sturdy , and very roomy when i had to travel recently , it fit not only my dvd player and accessories but also my nook -lrb- sorry , amazon -rrb- and its accessories
the case logic <unk> # eva molded # -inch dvd player case is perfect for the sony dvp-fx # -inch portable dvd player it protects the player well and really you can just use the player while its in the case a very nice gift
this case was worth the money it is very durable and comes with straps to hang it in the car so that all the kids can see it for long trips it works perfectly and arrived very fast
i bought this one to carry any of my # . # `` external hard drives when i tried , i could fit both of the drives on the drive compartment and put the power <unk> on the other pouches
the carrying # front seats to allow case holds the dvd player for carrying and storage it also comes with straps to allow it to fit between the # front seats that others in the rear can watch the <unk>
everything fits in this just fine we used on a long car trip i used a separate bag to hold the dvd 's this one holds the charger and ear plugs and a couple of
lots of room for the # inch tv for other goodies too cables , cd 's , dvd 's this semi-hard case a huge help for hard surfaces especially when dropped helps keep organized a small wonder
great case that protects my dvd player when i haul it around in my truck behind the seat my original soft case did not seam to protect it as well
i 'm using it to carry my <unk> it has enough room for the pc and power supply on one side and a slim external usb dvd burner plus discs on the other
my biggest difficulty in shopping for a case was finding one advertized for # -inch players that actually fit them our # -inch toshiba fits perfectly in this case -- even if the battery is attached the main compartment is high enough to hold headphones without crushing them as well as the accessory cords and battery for our player there is a side pocket that also has ample room for cords and a sleeve for dvds a previous reviewer said that this will not mount on the back headrest of his <unk> seat -- i do not find such to be the case the case includes instructions for mounting between two bucket seats or on the back headrest of one seat a sufficiently versatile product
after only using the case several times one of the locks became stuck in the locked position the only way to get it open was to break the lock low quality construction i would not recommend this case
i use it to lug my case files and books around the courthouse it 's sturdier than the last case i had i 've dragged it up and down stairs at the courthouse and other locations without problem it comes with a built-in area for your laptop and still leaves plenty of room for files i love all of the pockets for my pens , cards , scissors , and lawyer kit a great buy
after using more then # months i can say that this is good product for the money but the from pocket with # zippers side and velcro closure needed to be improved . if you put something else to front pocket , the space is not enough so the velcro closure is not functioning
the handle does n't come all of the way up sometimes , but overall it is a good litigation case the handle has n't <unk> me at a time when it would be embarrassing yet , but i live in <unk> of not being able to get the handle completely upright when trying to leave court but hey , i am still using it and am overall satisfied , especially considering the price
i read some of the earlier reviews on this case of buyers not being satisfied , but this case is perfect for my needs maybe solo changed it , as it seems to be well made would buy again
i take it to the school it fits # big folders # thick book , and there is a side for the laptop i am writing this review after a year a bought it , still works great great for pilots
this case is built pretty well and is perfect for hauling tons of large medical books there is still room for my netbook , accessories , school supplies and all my `` what if 's .
i have had this bag for at least one month and have not had any problems with it i am happy with the functionality of the <unk> and like the size of the bag i have been able to fit my # in laptop , two binders , plus other folders and papers i need on a daily basis overall very happy with the product
as an <unk> in the <unk> this bag is perfect for the <unk> meetings it is able to carry all books and materials needed for the meetings and it on wheels great bag for under $ #
i bought this backpack because it is one of the few items on the market that has a trolley pass-through it is a useful feature , but there is a problem with design the pack is quite tall so the trolley handle has to be very long to actually fit it if you see one of the <unk> pictures , it is fitted over one of those bags that is wider but not high , and has very long handle it does not fit over any of my regular cabin luggage because most bags are taller than they are wide , and for them the handle is too short also , the way the internal compartment is designed , your laptop needs to be very large to fit - at least # inches , and also needs to be quite thick if you have a smaller laptop like i do -lrb- a thin # in -rrb- , it will not be secure , because the strap does not tighten sufficiently it looks like i am going to have to saw in an extra strap myself to prevent my laptop from sliding all over the place but if you do n't care about those specific features , the pockets and other bits of design are good for the price
this is a good looking pack but it does fall over on it 's front - there is no good <unk> like the last port i got come on guys - the rest of the pack is really good i need to lean the front up against a wall so my laptop doesnt fall inside the pack
good features , good price , quality seems good however , i 'm a guy of average height and weight but the pack frequently feels like it is going to slip off my shoulders if feels like the weight inside causes the straps to slip apart , resulting in the sensation that the pack is never quite secure on your shoulders this is annoying and would be fixed by simple chest strap
this is my first backpack for business use i am a road warrior and have gone thru various other briefcases , shoulder bags , and roller bags was n't quite sure how i would like the backpack idea but i love it it is light , has more than enough pockets and pouches for all the <unk> i seem to accumulate easily slides on to my overnight <unk> bag when i choose to carry it that way , and all the compartments are very easy to get to would give it a hearty thumbs
purchased my backpack here at a much cheaper price than all the other online resources i reviewed product is excellent , its very durable , and quite comfortable perfect size for my everyday need in a backpack
i 've owned this bag for # -year now and travel about # % of the time this bag is very functional and the perfect size , but poorly made the fabric on the case has started `` <unk> `` every place there is any wear and some of the stitching has started coming loose last week the extension handle stopped working one of the spring loaded buttons broke so the handle no longer stays up by itself i will not own another kensington product
looked at many briefcases and this one is perfect at least for me it fits nicely under airline seats and it has plenty of room for the laptop , papers , etc . best part is the back side : curved so it ` fits ' against a person while hauling with the strap underneath the carry pole is hidden but lots of space for headphones and all the <unk> chargers a traveler has to carry these days
i am traveling in my new position and must take my laptop with me since i have had neck surgery , i ca n't carry heavy bags anymore i wanted something that i could roll and get me through the airports the price on rolling laptop bags is <unk> i looked and looked and finally , after a week , i was about to give up when i ran up on this bag i love this bag , it has room for everything , and more i could not believe the price , it was $ # . # or more less expensive i will always come to you for my shopping needs
this is a great little computer bag on wheels it fits perfectly in the regional jet overhead space or under the seat it holds plenty with it 's multiple pockets light weight , great for airline travel nice handle that comes up high enough for taller folks
i just received the brenthaven sleeve for the black macbook that i just <unk> amazon i would n't call it a sleeve because that implies that you <unk> your laptop in from the top it is more of a <unk> luggage style case there is also a zippered compartment inside the case , and i am concerned <unk> zipper might rub against and scratch the macbook it is also so snug inside , it 's a struggle to get the laptop seated i 'm wondering if i was sent the right case on the plus side , it is very well constructed , but do n't think it 's right for me
i love the case , i bought the adapter holder as well the annoying thing is that the strap has swivels on it that squeak when you walk sometimes i just hold on to the swivel to shut it up then i noticed that the strap hooks were digging into the nylon cover of the case then the hook , itself popped open and would not go back into a closed position when you see it , you 'll understand what can happen there is not enough overlap in the hook its still a good case i 've had the case # months and use it all the time i have to use the handle now though
it 's a nice bag . small and looks nice but it has a little problem . it 's so tight and you ca n't put your mouse easily inside i was surprised when i saw the pocket inside the bag is half size of it ! ! i 'll upload some photos to be clear for you . if you want to carry the charger , you better buy a small bag and put you charger in it
i bought the brenthaven edge sleeve for my # `` macbook the bag is very well built and feels solid all around i like that it is very neat to hold and carry the macbook fits very nicely in the bag however , there is not much space for anything else , including the electric cable hence the # stars rather than #
the edge i sleeve for macbook is just perfect for what need the macbook fits in snugly and securely , due to the `` thick `` protective padding looks expensive but priced right love it , great buy
this case is made to fit the macbook my computer fits snugly and the case is well padded to protect it i like the size of this case as well there is a pull tab that helps you to easily remove your computer when you are ready to use it i think this is the perfect case
lightweight and very padded , gives me peace of mind when i travel the laptop fits snugly inside , so custom fit is effective there is room for some papers , but if you want to fit lots of stuff inside this is not your bag for me it 's great , and if i need to fit more items the bag is light and small enough to throw it into a messenger bag
simply the perfect compliment to the new macbook we bought for our daughter fits nice and snug with very good padding for protection no room for peripherals , but that 's not what it 's for small enough to slide into a larger bag like she had for the larger laptop she used in the past when she needs more room
no michael <unk> pockets all over easy to remove for an airport scan can operate a macbook w/out taking it fully out of the case dropped mine once from <unk> and no damage
i purchased this laptop sleeve/bag as i wanted a laptop bag that could function as a sleeve and a bag when needed , and also that would protect my investment i must say that this bag covers all of my requirements for those of you looking for a big bag that will house the laptop , books , mouse , etc . . . then this is not for you however , if you want a sleek , custom-fit laptop sleeve for your # . # `` macbook then this is it excellent protection and i absolutely love it ! -lrb- and the price i got it for was none short of outstanding -rrb-
purchased this item # days ago and have it shipped to <unk> the design is beautiful and user friendly unfortunately , for a leather product , i was surprised that the sewing of the leather around the key joint between the main case and padded shoulder strap was torn apart that was my first usage after receiving the <unk> from samsonite would not recommend this product without a <unk> look at it now , i have no idea how am i going to make a claim since this item is only available in the usa with a # years warranty waiting for samsonite usa reply
this bag is of a very nice color with a lot of storage pockets all around -lrb- both inside and outside -rrb- however , the finishing of the bag is not very good which reflects that samsonite is not performing quality control of the bag prior to releasing it into the market this is especially seen in the stitching of the bag which is exposed outside and looks quite bad therefore , i am concerned if this bag will take the test of time and last for a few years of use somewhere down the line , top companies like samsonite should <unk> cost saving <unk> of manufacturing in china on atleast premium products
the bag comes close to meeting the promise it held for me when i ordered it has tons of space , pockets etc . the front of the bag has good quality leather - thick & rich the leather on the back of the bag is made of thin leather - not the thick rich leather that makes the front in any case , i do not think it is full grain overall , am happy for the price i paid for it -lrb- # $ -rrb- - remains to be seen how long it lasts
the design of this bag is great the price is good , based on others on the market quality control is obviously lacking the handle on my was not completely stitched down -lrb- the area where you grip the handle , that is folded over and stitched -rrb- i took it to the guy that fixes my shoes and he stitched it would have sent it back , but would have been more trouble than it was worth but that should have been caught at the factory i 've only carried it twice , so will see how it holds up -lrb- lots of nice comments on it , though -rrb-
after thoroughly researching online , i went with this leather briefcase i notice there are several briefcases by other vendors that look identical to this samsonite but they charge a third to almost a half more this case is really well made , the leather is thick and looks stylish it fits my laptop plus has plenty of room for other stuff i am very pleased with my purchase well done samsonite
i loved the lap top case as it had compartments for all my supplies i had to send it back though because i have an alien lap top and it did not fit right in the alien lap top carrier i had to force it in the carrier i did not want to scratch my lap top so i am looking for something with more space if you have a small lap top , # or # inch , this would be perfect
its a nice bag and does what you want it to do carries a lot of things that you need to carry around so i would recommend getting this if you want somethign to old your nice alienware notebook like me =
this bag is excellent lots of pockets and great quality material it is however a little bulky , so if you have a small laptop , you may want to look for something smaller also , it is a casual bag , so it 's not so good if you 're thinking of buying a bag that you can take to the office
saying this is the end all bag for eliminating back and shoulder pain is an <unk> plenty of <unk> laptop zipper <unk> to <unk> straps - chest and <unk> heavy without anything in it adding a laptop -lrb- which was the point of buying this model -rrb- makes it almost impossible to carry straps come off and are a little flimsy the plastic piece came off the chest one a few <unk> adds shoulder pain overall this bag is decent and <unk> some pain , though does not eliminate pain as it states adding a laptop and a few other items to the bag ... it gets heavy quickly
this is amazing , my laptop of # & # # ; goes proctected , i can put gadgets and books on this bag , your system for the back is very comfortable too i recomended this bag #
i 've had this bag for year i love it as a law student who also works during the day it gives me plenty of storage room for work and school stuff while , at the same , looking good recently , the clip holding the strap to the bag broke not sure why but i e-mailed the company through their website and got an e-mail back within a few hours with an offer to send the bag in to be fixed they fixed and i had it back within a few days they 're a great young company who wants to sell good stuff i highly recommend doing business with them
wanted something that was easier to carry than an actual back pack and that was easier to load and unload my laptop in the airport this bag is perfect for those needs best of both worlds with the backpack straps and shoulder strap very comfortable to carry around as well i would recommend this bag to anyone and everyone
carries laptop & ipad , plus a couple of folders & / or a # -ring binder ... plus power cords , mouse , laser pointer , phone -lrb- s -rrb- , pens , pencils basically , my entire office is now comfortably mobile i 've got a bad back , so comfort , posture , and weight distribution are critical this bag is awesome
i bought this briefcase for my husband this christmas and i am terribly disappointed with it it came well packed and the design is good , however the leather is so hard that there are not words to describe it i am returning it immediately
as others have commented , the leather is very , very stiff i may take it to a <unk> to see if he can soften it that being said , it 's well-constructed and fully featured i would have paid more for softer leather
this was a christmas present for my daughter she likes the product and all the different compartments , but she said it was a little heavy empty it was very well made
i 'm very pleased with the sturdy leather construction of the case the layout of the pockets and dividers allows for organized storage of many items being able to securely slip this case over the handle of a piece of rolling luggage is a great help while traveling the case looks very good , but it gives up a little in appearance to allow it to have so much storage capacity the zipper placement on the front pocket makes it a little hard to get into , but it does look nice the metal that the shoulder strap snaps and d rings are made of appears to be very cheep and i 'm concerned about how well it will hold up in summary : great features and functionality , good looks , questionable hardware
purchased this for my husband -lrb- who is very picky -rrb- as a replacement bag for his work . he wanted something that had a lot of storage & divided pockets for files he has had this bag for over year now and it is holding up very well . no complaints or <unk> about this bag -lrb- and that is a big deal ! we did purchase a seperate & # # ; gel & # # ; type shoulder strap more for comfort than anything
this bag is sturdy and able to carry a great deal of office things i wish there was a bit more padding for the laptop , but i can live with this minor issue , it has several compartments and places to house different sized articles needed for every day office work it is a great bag and it looks professional so that taking it to meetings is not a concern
this was a gift for xmas for my son who is recently now an executive he was toting his stuff in a backpack until i upgraded him to a professional briefcase it holds all his files , his laptop , his ipad , his keys , his notes , everything keeps him organized and he gets more respect using this , rather than a backpack it seemed to be well made and it 's very classy should it fall apart before next xmas , i will update this review
i have used this on several trips and it is an excellent briefcase i is tight for a # & # # ; laptop , but a # . # & # # ; fits in it easily the storage is great and the materials are very nice this is also relatively lightweight , another plus the <unk> is a nice option for an overnight trip too
bought this for my husbands bday in july its the perfect size the leather is beautiful and the look is professional without being stuffy <unk> bag and great price cant beat prime shipping
this was a gift for my husband -lrb- he 'd had an older leather briefcase for around # years and it was definitely time for a change ! he said this one is perfect and is very pleased with it
i bought this bag to carry a new hp # inch mini notebook with it 's accessories the bag seems to be made very well and certainly has the room to hold everything i need and more my only regret is that it is much taller than i would have needed for this mini notebook , but i knew that when i ordered it it was the nicest bag i could find that would meet all of my needs someone ought to design a bag like this to carry the mini netbooks that have become so popular , along with accessories such as a mouse , power strip , etc .
i also have the # . # `` dell laptop , and it fits quite nicely in this bag when i first received it , i almost returned it because i thought it was just too small to be useful , but then i decided to give it a chance while it 's not large enough for taking on extended work trips , it 's perfect for just back and forth to work i have the citygear los angeles case for traveling , and that one is just too big and bulky for me to carry just commuting , whereas this one is awesome it fits my -lrb- small -rrb- purse , power cord , a few pens and pencils , and on the little key ring that 's inside , i keep my flash drive and a <unk> cloth it 's been a great bag i also only gave it # stars though for lack of a water bottle holder it really would n't have been * that * difficult to fit one on i solved that by getting a clip-on one to clip to the strap , but it 's still somewhat awkward but yeah , i 'd totally buy this again
very well constructed , durable and designed to hold a # & # # ; ipad including a mini keyboard other accessories are stored in a separate zippered pouch documents that require easy access fit into a separate velcro secured pocket with another zippered pocket for more <unk> items such as car keys the main pouch for the ipad or mini-laptop is not zippered and contributed to the # star rather than the five star rating
i actually work in a store that sells the # `` version of this bag and i 've always like it but it would have been huge for my # . # `` toshiba laptop i bought this one and my laptop fits tightly into it it 's not a squeeze but it is tight would n't reccommend the bag for any laptops bigger than # . # `` but it 's great for anything around that size
i 've been using this for months now for my # & # # ; lenovo twist works fine , very sturdy only problem for me is targus is written all over the bag in bright yellow would of liked it in one place only instead of on the bag and then in larger letters on the strap reason for # stars i feel like i 'm their <unk>
the bag is worth a solid # stars in my opinion the only <unk> i had with it was that even though it is designed for a # . # laptop i initially could barely get my new macbook to fit after a couple weeks it did get better and it is no longer a struggle to get the laptop in and out i am thinking though that my new macbook is pretty slim , and someone might find it nearly impossible to fit an older model -lrb- thicker -rrb- into the bag
this is the perfect bag for a netbook and a note plus folders everyone said it sucked , however after i bought one everyone started buying them it 's a great , light durable bag for your netbook
