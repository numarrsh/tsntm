i do really like this product it is a very nice value my only negative it that it needs to be <unk> higher off the <unk> as it does tend to get scratched at the bottom from rubbing against uneven pavement
considering the price of similar rolling notebooks , this item is great the zipper <unk> a bit , but it is probably because i am <unk> it with my books for law school :
the bf likes it it feels a bit flimsy if it is n't zipped all the way up and you pull it along wish the divider went all the way down
i received my bag good condition and it met my expectation its roomy and compact i do hope it keeps up with me because it will be used daily for office great for short and long overseas trips
nice strong and durable for the price i would like to see an additional pocket on the reverse side with padding or possibly a side pocket for quick access to phone etc . also , larger wheels would be ideal for outside the office
i really am glad i bought this rolling office bag it is very roomy and has space for all of my essentials , as well as extra items i would keep in my purse , so it eliminates me having to carry a separate purse i am a nurse and this bag makes it easy for me to transport everything i need for work , like files and medical equipment , but without having to carry it i like that it is not leather ; the wheels are great and the bag does not tip over the handle extends to a perfect height for me and feels comfortable i would also use this bag as a great <unk> bag the only negative thing is i wished each compartment attached to the bottom of the bag , creating a complete separation so that small items would not find their way into the next compartment this is just a minor thing , but i 'm still very glad i bought this bag
the price was right the bag so far gets the job done my laptop fits the handle glides up and down wtih ease , nice arm reach -lrb- i 'm # ' # `` , but usually have on # & # # ; heels -rrb- the wheels roll , only occasionally i have problems with sharp turns my issue is the color it was only offered in black i ca n't love a black bag it 's so manly , drab , <unk> !
this <unk> just what i was looking for at an affordable price the only drawback is that the handle is not as sturdy as i 'd like , but it has n't been an issue so far construction of the bag itself is very good
i usually carry one large textbook and a few notebooks ... also a small rolled up jacket it has worked just fine in the last month i 'll keep you posted if there is a change
i have n't experienced the wheel problems that others have <unk> about -- yet however , i do n't overload the case and i 'm pretty hard on it , lugging it across sand and other <unk> every day great for the price -- even if it only lasts a year under my <unk> work schedule
so far tote is holding up well i use it all the time as i am a flight crew hope the wheels last as i noticed they can not be removed to replace
it 's handy for carrying documents , save my back from having to carry a loaded paperwork a handle is easy to pull up and down the bag has <unk> of the stability serve the purpose of the purchase
i 'm very happy with this bag i drag it around almost daily , for a couple of months now has lots of room for laptop , cooler , files , adapters , cords , mouse , with room to spare . wheels seem adequate , seems good construction , and the padding seems protective enough i like the vertical access -lsb- last bag was horizontal -rsb- zipper pulls seem of good quality & should last only wish it had a shoulder strap , then it would have # stars excellent price for quality & space
the product came very quickly , which was really nice i had to get a larger one for my computer as i use it for work and need the extra space for documents and such i would recommend it anyone who needs this item
i needed something to carry my computer , accessories and files back and forth to my office ca n't carry anything because of shoulder and back problems my only concern is the handle which seems a bit fragile , and i 'm concerned at how long it will last but the price was right and so far so good
i bought this bag to hold two laptops and other personal items for travel it has not dissapointed so far it looks very nice and i have had a lot of compliments using it mind you if you overload it the wheels do n't work right
i was thrown back to see that these cases run well over $ # at staples , office depot and most other office supply retailers the bag is great and has a ton of space for me to fit my laptop and all of my work related supplies the only complaint i have is the handle to pull it it often jams and it takes some <unk> to be able to pull the handle all the way up other than that the case is great
i like this bag as everything fits so well and there is still room for my laptop this is my second one as the wheels wore out on the first one after a year or two i use it every day and it is a reasonable price - so no complaints
i finally gave in on getting a roller bag due to back trouble i looked online for the lightest weight one - and this also happened to be one of the least expensive one i have only started using it but it seems to be decent quality , easy to roll , easy to collapse and expand the <unk> i do n't need lots of compartments so this suits my needs
so far so good but i 've only had it a month i 'm a nurse case manager and wheel it all over a # bed hospital unlike other reviewers , i 've had no problem with the telescoping handle my only complaints are that the fabric inside dividing the separate compartments is pretty thin i can see that it would rip pretty easily -- but it has n't also , one of the wheels has a & # # ; <unk> & # # ; - like a shopping cart with a flat , but it 's a minor annoyance otherwise , i 'm pretty pleased with the bag especially considering it was only $ # i 'd say it 's a pretty good deal
i was looking for a briefcase that would also hold my laptop this product is excellent it has enough space for my work files and laptop and then some lots of other similar products out there that are more expensive
loved this so much i just ordered another one ! my brother is a music teacher and he has the # st # ! he loves it too ! room for everything , laptops , cd 's , books , lunch , credit cards ! !
for the price it 's great unlike some of the other reviews , the wheels and telescopic handle work fine . the real test came yesterday when i had to <unk> the snow and salt covered streets in manhattan with it tough bag and pretty water resistant as well get it is my suggestion
for $ # this is awesome i have tons of heavy books i had to lug everywhere everyone in my class was buying rolling backpacks or whatever could be found at other stores these bags started at $ # and went up fast from there very happy with this purchase
the bag is the perfect traveler for someone who likes to travel light and carry their bag with them the wheels make it easy to get around and the size of the bag makes it travel friendly the shipper was quick and i received the bag within a week even though that week included a holiday
i see a lot of clients throughout the day and at different locations , so this is perfect i call it my portable office because it can carry just about everything in here there are a lot of compartments , so it 's easy to keep organized the wheels are super convenient to have they were well in the office and to and from clients homes the price was extremely reasonable , as well it was a <unk> between this and spending a lot more for a nicer name brand in the end , i am glad i chose this i 'd highly recommend for you , too i recommended it to a coworker and she bought one too
because i 'm a <unk> , i always have to carry # or # big binders this computer bag is totally awesome for me i am able to put my computer and # big binders in the bag the binders that i place in this bag are about # to # inches wide each
this is my # nd targus bag i love how big it is i can pack a weekend worth of clothes in it and it is very very durable ! !
this bag met all of my expectations i am a online student and i carry my books and laptop almost everywhere i go having this bag makes it so much easier
this is actually better than i expected for the price granted it does n't feel as sturdy as my company issued on but the <unk> are solid , which is what i needed and it fits all the t <unk> i need for work great deal for the price
i heard if you do n't spend a lot of money the wheels stop working i 've had this a year and it gets a lot of use and it 's still going strong
this case is roomy and was ideal for me to carry books , supplies , and a laptop for teaching the material seems sturdy and quality appears to be good although i am not currently teaching and have not used the case in a while , i have been very pleased with this purchase
great case for my laptop also holds my mini projector and anything else i need the wheels operate very smooth and the handle goes up or down easily wish i had bought this a year ago
i like this bag because it is worth what i paid for it i only wished it had more pockets , but other than that it works for what i need it for carrying a heavy load
this is a very good case velcro strap holds laptop in well padded area lots of room for other items carried # changes of clothes along with passports , etc . for overnight flights to so fits well in airplane aisle and overhead bin could have a stronger pulling handle and a # nd set of wheels would absolutely top it off , but is fine for my sometimes travel not sure how it would hold up with heavy use
holds a lot more than i thought it would there 's enough room if you wanted to throw in an outfit or <unk> for traveling i was surprised how well this bag was made
i love this bag just received it today my # . # inch laptop fits perfectly room for my phone , kindle , chargers etc . . it rolls nicely ca n't wait to take on the plane july # th . will give more feedback when i return it took me several weeks until i decided to buy it was looking at a samsonite but did n't want to spend sooo much excellent price $ # . # free
i love my targus metro roller it has plenty of space for my files as well as a great compartment for my laptop it rolls great and is easy to carry
the price was the best around i gave it as a gift and she loves it the only thing i wish is that i would of found one with larger wheel to clear our snow and steps
this roller laptop case is perfect for hauling my laptop , scanner and work assignments on a daily basis it 's pretty light weight , with roomy pockets and extended handle it fits all of my work and more the price is comparable to walmart with better service ... delivered right to my door
i received this item on tuesday , and it is all that and more it has truly met my expectation i like all the compartments for pens , cell phone , etc . great price ! !
this would have been a perfect buy had it not been for the fact it was just # & # # ; deeper than described -lrb- <unk> airlines have some very small requirements for personal <unk> -rrb- i was tempted to use it anyway but amazon took the # units back without any question i still wish they would have fit because they were really an excellent value
thank <unk> , i received them in good <unk> order both given as gift they were just fantastic , easy go and now they are in <unk> used as a <unk> bag during the travel i may say its a multi purpose bag
i had one of these , but the rollers finally wore out , so i had to replace it after looking all over , i chose the same one again -- it 's a good value for the price i am a teacher and use this daily to carry a laptop , and two tablets , a multitude of assorted wires , papers , pens , notebooks , etc . it 's light -- easy for carrying up stairs , it has <unk> through a lot of snow , traveled as a carry-on on numerous flights , and was a pretty good bag for the money
targus makes some really good cases and this is no exception i order roller cases for a department of around # people and this particular case is as good or better than cases costing # or # times more the staff is waiting for their current cases to wear out so they can get a replacement like this
despite of the weak wheels review , i decided to buy ... and here it is ... still getting stronger i never worry about breaking the wheels when using it , yet , it is still working as it should be ... . well , let 's wait and see , but i 'm loving it
this bag has been a great buy it may not last as long as the others i 've seen in stores and on line , but at this price i can buy three for the same money
been using this roller for work for about # months and so far so good my # lb laptop was taking its toll on my back , so i opted for this roller it has saved me from back and shoulder pains , and has enough space to put all of my gadgets , folders , and <unk> laptop the material is n't anything like a samsonite or the like , but you get a good bang for your buck in this wonderfully useful roller
have loved this from day one i use it every day and get a lot of pleasure from it i have another one from samsonite and it is very comparable except for the handle -lrb- this one is not as good but , adequate -rrb-
i am very happy with this case for years , i carried so many papers , books , lunch and purse with me every day to work and could barely open doors decided to try this out and see how it would work it 's great even took it on the plane with me and it fit perfectly under the seat
i bought it for my wife since she had a laptop plus gear for work this allows her to take that weight off her shoulder and roll her work papers without any issues we have n't experienced any issues with this suitcase yet i would definitely recommend it
this roller has saved my back convenient , plenty of room and easy to pull it holds a laptop plus plenty of additional room for lectures , etc . good product for the price and so far have found it durable as well
i love this rolling bag it has sufficient space to store two laptops and files i will never carry another laptop in a bag nor on my arm i highly recommend this bag
i love this roller i travel often for work and this makes my <unk> through airports and planes so much more comfortable i recommend this roller case to anyone who travels with laptops , books or documents
i bought this for a friend she stated it is fantastic it looks like it is holding up very well the price was very reasonable and it appears to be still in good condition
after <unk> around lopsided from heavy laptop bags and too many files , i started looking for a rolling bag this one 's affordable enough to replace every year , but months of daily use later , the zippers are still working fine , wheels are operating smoothly , and best of all ... my shoulders are in alignment again the action in the pull-up handle is a little flimsy , but works fine plenty of pockets and nooks in the front & # # ; desk drawer & # # ; the padded laptop section fits my # & # # ; with room to spare the other section can hold # & # # ; of files , or more happy with my purchase
this laptop case fits all my stuff in it my laptop fits perfect in the laptop slot and wheels are very smooth i have already put several miles on this case and it still rolls smooth my coworkers are also very impressed
i have to haul around # + pounds of paperwork and a laptop to boot i was looking at those expensive cases and stumbled on this one i love it i can hold everything i need to haul with me and it does n't sound like i 'm pulling a <unk> behind me nice quiet wheels
the <unk> desk came so quickly and was such a wonderful purchase this carrier was easily worth double what i paid for it the compartments were large and was so easy to roll i am actually considering purchasing another
it was just what my wife needed to carry her work items to and from the office the wheels roll very smooth and it holds everything she needs her only comment is that she wishes it had more dividers inside
i loved that i was able to get a bag that fits the tons of teacher materials i cart home with me every night be sure to lean it at a # degree angle when pulling because the bottom has the <unk> to drag on the <unk> the telescoping handle makes it easy to not hunch over it feels sturdy and the zippers are strong i feel like i scored a bargain on this bag
not worth the money materials are terrible quality , and within a couple weeks of using this bag the straps began ripping looks very cheap in person and is very cheap quality save yourself the trouble and do not buy this bag
i bought this bag and it did what it was supposed to do however , beware i 'm not sure if its the <unk> of the caribbean air but the handles have completely disintegrated a fabric handle would have been perfect as it is i cant use this without it leaving bits of <unk> black bits all over me even tried wrapping the handles but its just too untidy will have to get a new bag :
i like the color of the tote , and my # inch laptop fits in easily there is a separate zipped section that will carry files or purse content as well as two velcroed pockets on either side , if avoiding lots of things to carry is a goal i did not find that my computer and my ipad # would fit without <unk> , and i felt that would compromise the padding protection for both device and computer i also bought a targus bag for the # inch lap top from amazon , and found that to be far <unk> although without the `` bing `` of the <unk> tote i like the ease of carrying the tote it fits against the body and does not feel like an awkward <unk> i have some concern that the color advertises the content for <unk> <unk> <unk>
it is very cute but the straps broke within # weeks right where they sewed them on stupid design , had to get it fixed next time i will pay more and get a better
i did have a problem with this item because it came with a couple very ugly black spot that wo n't come out but on this matter , amazon did take care of the problem very well -lrb- and that 's why i decided to write the reviews for the items i bought -rrb- other than that , i 'm wondering how long the strap handles will last -lrb- they do n't look strong -rrb- and i think it could have more protection - padding - on the laptop compartiment
very nice bag , but did not fit my studio # dell laptop properly it was very tight and did not have enough padding in laptop compartment for good protection straps are also a little on the stiff side this bag did not fit my needs , but could be good for those with smaller laptops , and could fit a padded sleeve for better protection
i really like this tote for my computer with one exception i <unk> the handles , they are very stiff and will not lay back to be able to insert the computer into the bag they are continually in the way i wish they had used a different material
this bag is definitely durable and pretty much as expected for the price holds my # `` laptop and all files etc . needed when traveling wish the straps were longer and more flexible one major thing for me is that this item is definitely not red as described one of the big selling points for me was the color i love red and wanted a red bag - this bag is not anywhere near red ... weird `` pinkish `` color which looks strange with the brown straps and trim minor complaint , but color was a major consideration for me and i probably would not have even been interested had this item been described as `` pink and brown `` in any event , this bag will do the job until i downsize my # `` laptop
looks good and would work well was a bit big for my # in . laptop i was trying to leave room for the <unk> battery on it , but probably would have been fine in a # in . tote received in amazing time and in good condition
this laptop <unk> meets my expectations space for # `` laptop , documents , and even a zippered organizer for pens , even a space to hold cds i was able to fir the power cord and a cordless mouse the handles are strudy and the <unk> is very good for the price
i ordered this bag on the # th and just received it fedex on the # st ! <unk> that was faster than i thought the bag is perfect for my laptop , <unk> , and much much more plus , its so cute ! very <unk> ! sooo pleased with my purchase , no regrets here !
daughter loves it it was a christmas gift and i was a little hesitant because my daughters ' idea of fashion and mine ... ... well ... they arent the same i was just looking for something with a little style and feminine for her , rather then the same ` ol black bags that <unk> the market she love it said the straps were plenty long enough to carry over her shoulder too
this bag is well worth it it fits my # inch hp laptop with ease and its <unk> is a great asset for a professional - room for files , power cords and all sorts of accessories . happy with my purchase
i purchased this tote as a present for my daughter who is <unk> college very soon she was very happy to get this as a gift and she has been using it for her # inch laptop she is very happy with the item and wants to have another one for her next computer all ready she will use it going on to her first job after school
i purchased this for myself while doing christmas shopping and just got around to switching it out for my laptop and work items all of the internal pockets when i put my <unk> and other items in them have defective stitching and since it 's past jan # the website says i ca n't return it
nice leather and a good shape make this a pretty bag but when they call it a & # # ; bucket , & # # ; they mean it there 's no top zipper , snap or even a flap to keep the top closed and covered i do n't feel comfortable carrying my expensive electronics in a bag with a completely open top nor would i care to see my papers , mail , or whatever falling onto the floor if the bag tipped over , so i returned it it does n't make much sense to label it a & # # ; laptop & # # ; bag it 's not a fashionable briefcase ; it is a classy and sturdy tote
it 's a great bag but the problem i have is that it is heavy all by itself when i add a computer and other items it 's too heavy to carry sorry i bought it
i travel a lot for work and wanted a nice , professional , classy computer bag that would fit under an airplane seat i thought this would be the one : such a lovely bag , and so well made to my great disappointment , it was far too heavy and bulky to be comfortable carrying as a shoulder bag , and was just a bit too tall for the handle on my rolling luggage i sadly had to return it -lrb- i instead found a nylon bag at the container store with wider straps that carries the computer horizontally instead of vertically ; the same amount of stuff feels so much lighter !
does what i wanted ... carries all my stuff including all of my electronics lots of pockets . love the padded section for laptop and table i can fit both in that section
i bought this bag about # years ago i get complimented all the time about it it holds a lot i generally carry my # inch laptop , a mouse , electronic notebook , a few paper folders , pens , post it notes , tissues , lip gloss and other odds and ends in it it is awesome it is holding up almost everywhere , but the front pouch zipper just broke
this is a perfect leather work bag i am a small female and i think this is the perfect size it is a bit long , but because it is n't wide i do n't crash into things when trying to pass through halls - which i appreciate it can hold my # & # # ; laptop perfectly and has lots of pockets to hold <unk> cards i would love to buy this again if it came in black
i recently purchased this bag to replace many other bags i have paid a fortune for that were poorly made and never lasted more then # months this bag is the complete opposite , the leather is of good quality and the bag itself is well made there is plenty of room to fit all my ` junk ' in , including my # . # ' laptop and leads the colours are great , lovely dark brown leather and vibrant blue lining delivery time was amazing , it was shipped from america to australia within a <unk> 'm very happy with my purchase and highly recommend it
i bought this for toting around my laptop when traveling this is a well designed travel tote lots of space for everything in addition to computer items my # x # inch <unk> fit just right i especially appreciate the optional zip open pocket in the back that allows you to change the pocket into a strap to hold the bag onto a carry-on handle i love the colorful blue on the inside of the bag this is a well-constructed bag i highly recommended it it would be fabulous if it were available in colors and not just brown , then i could justify buying another
i saw a different bag by the same designer in a store and i was researching it when this one came up under the `` people who bought this also viewed ... `` section of amazon during my search i liked the style much better , bought it and i am very pleased with it it is very roomy , holds all of the daily travel essentials from laptop to lunch the straps are a great length for carrying on the shoulder , kind of long -lrb- i 'm short ! -rrb- for carrying by hand the leather is extremely soft and everyone who has seen it has complimented it , right before they say `` can i touch it ? `` and then ask me where they can get one like it i 've been through about # briefcases , laptop cases and bags in the last # years looking for the right one and this one is perfect quality all around
when i received my leather tote bag , i was so excited to open my box up as soon as i got a hold of my bag , i was in big smiles , cause i know that not one of my friends own my bag first day i used it my kid said mom , i like ur bag and then so my friends noticed my bag and asked me where i got it , i told them amazon.com i love my tote bag so much room , and i love the fact that i stand out in the middle of the crowd i am also thinking of getting another one
the backpack started coming apart at the seams after # months the backpack supposedly has a # year warranty but this is worthless if the customer service department will not respond to a customer 's repeated forms of contact buy another brand
i am a nursing student and i carry a good amount of books including my # inch laptop i purchased this bag because of it 's claim to be durable let just say it did ` nt even last a year so now i have to get a new bag this semester the bag rips at the seems of the zippers not the reinforced parts
the zippers , the handle on the top of the backpack and the material are of excellent quality unfortunately , one of the plastic buckles on the straps that go over your back broke after just # months of school use when i went into the online order in amazon.com to try to see if i could return it , the policy said that the return period had expired after just # days it seems like a product like this should last at least half a school year
this only lasted about # months and the zipper broke contacted seller and they only warranty for # days i would try to find something else if i were you
love the design and features but definitely not quality materials rubber handle tore and seams split within two months i use it everyday but treated it well not a good backpack i 'm looking at other options
bought a backpack -- quality is absolutely awful ... rubber is falling apart -- seams are ripping ... suggest you invest in more quality in your materials -- you have lost a customer ... suggest people buy other
this bag has ample capacity for my dell vostro # , a # `` laptop with an extended life battery that makes it a bit wider but , within a year of owning the bag , the main zipper came undone and the stitching on both shoulder straps has started to pull out this is not what i expected from a pretty expensive wenger product
had this exact same backpack -lrb- bought it from best buy -rrb- and used it for # years eventually the zipper for the laptop compartment started to rip and eventually needed to replace it decided to buy the same exact backpack since i loved my previous one so much however , after about # . # months of using it , the seam near the zipper started to rip i contacted the seller but they told me i had to contact swiss gear after i contacted swiss gear , they wanted me to basically jump through # <unk> just to get the backpack looked at they were n't even going to give me free shipping thus , i chose to go a different direction and bought a similar style backpack but the targus brand - and i love it
i bought this backpack because of the reviews i did n't use it the first week because i had n't received my computer and hardly used it the first three weeks i really like all of the pockets and their arrangement but when i took the backpack on a trip i noticed in week # the stitching on both shoulder pads started to <unk> and was slowly unravelling since this holds the edging on the shoulder straps this is a serious defect on top of that <unk> wo n't take it back because it is past their # day return period not a very good situation
i purchased the ibex # `` pack about a year ago for use with my work laptop and assorted gear i had to carry i had not used the pack more than two months when the mesh facing on the left shoulder strap separated at the seam and started to unravel it was clear this had happened because of the load on the strap , which was only a laptop , power brick , and a few dvds and a lock not more than # pounds , total for this to happen on a laptop bag designed to carry a # `` laptop and room for several books , water bottles and other gear was <unk> poor quality in manufacturing the ibex is a great bag otherwise , and by the other reviews i think mine may be an exception , but it should not have come apart in any event
will try to keep it short pros - many pockets , many pouches , not an <unk> it is pretty low profile , fit a hp probook # -lrb- just barely -rrb- . thought i loved it , that brings me to cons <unk> zipper almost <unk> it , my laptop fit , score went to stash the power supply cord in another of the many compartments , hey this zipper isnt very smooth , it should be smooth for a # + dollar bag maybe it will break in after a few zips , that seems reasonable nope it did not break in it just broke it seemed like a nice bag for # minutes , but for the price i want something to last a good long while put in a return ticket a little while ago , will most likely edit once i find out how that goes for now it gets # stars , i almost hate it , i really want to if the zipper would have broke on my way to or from somewhere that would have secured the hate , for now it will sit in its shipping box in shame
i had a zipper break in half the first week i had it , i lost another one , and i just had to sew the bottom back together there was about a # inch gap after awhile
the ibex # in notebook <unk> would of been perfect for my son to use to take his laptop to classes if the zipper on the laptop section had not failed after only two days i could not take a chance and get the same backpack to replace the broken one i looked <unk> for a backpacks with metal zippers i found one , but all the reviews said the stitching failed in the seams i guess if they make something too good i won ' t be spending money to constantly replacing quickly worn out products being put in this position all the time is getting to me it has been a long time since i have purchased anything that seemed well constructed over all aspects of the product oh well , in summery if the zippers were good heavy duty ones this backback would of been perfect and i would be <unk> praises all over the place so sorry i could n't do that
i owned a wenger synergy laptop backpack by swissgear a year or so back i was expecting the same quality in this bag the synergy had a thicker -lrb- or more rugged -rrb- skin also , the chains had this quality that made them seem <unk> the bag <unk> quality from every <unk> it was an object of <unk> , if you know what i mean this bag , even though good in every respect , has a slightly thinner skin , the chain are not the same and the feel is slightly <unk> the carry handle is plastic and does not have a padded carry handle again , this bag is whatever everyone else is saying about it , it is just not of the absolute top notch quality that i was expecting maybe , swiss gear has reduced the quality across the board
