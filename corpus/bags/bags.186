my daughter is # & has many books to carry the back pack is sturdy & rolls very well , even when she runs i would say this rolling backpack has definitely met our needs
my daughter 's loves it my girls elementary school required every second grade students & up to have a laptop this backpack is great this is the third one i bought for my girls i would buy it again next school year wish they have more colors & designs to pick from
i got this for my wife who was getting <unk> carrying laptop in other types of bags without wheels i love the design and the sturdy build of this bag in the last bag my wife got from target , the <unk> broke but this one looks solid and she has been using it for a few months now
i was a bit uncertain when buying this for my niece -lrb- christmas gift -rrb- , but she loves it ! -lrb- she is # , in case that matters -rrb- without being able to see and touch it in person , i worried that the quality might be less than ideal well , it 's been a few months now and she takes it to school everyday sometimes it 's on her back , sometimes she rolls it on the ground , and it still looks brand new
all the other bags tore up quickly this bag is built very sturdy and easy for my # year old to use at school and then drag on the bus great price too
this bag works great for my # year old the wheels are sturdy and enough room for a # inch binder and many books also has many zippered pockets very pleased , especially for the price
my daughter was in the fourth grade when i ordered this for her she was able to fit lots of books in it . . and more she always got many compliments about it
the rolling backpack addressed my <unk> grader 's backaches she loves the polka dots she 's hard on the backpack throwing it into the trunk hard on the zippers no issues durability issues so far -lrb- # weeks -rrb-
the backpack fits a lot of stuff it rolls well the colors are pretty the only thing i did not like is that the side pockets are not deep enough and a bottle of water falls easily out
i was looking for a backpack to carry my computer and all my items in when i travel with my band , and this is perfect love the roominess , and high quality wheel system -- -- - great !
bought these to keep gunk out of the ports on my macbook since i travel with it a lot this fell short of my expectations for the following reasons # -rrb- while they fit in the holes they stick out of the <unk> a lot i was expecting something more flush with the surface # -rrb- not a snug fit <unk> lightly against any of these knocks them out of the ports because of the two reasons above i lost all of the port covers after two weeks
within # hours , one of the plugs had fallen out and was forever lost i 've tried to be exceptionally careful ever since , but my efforts were in vain they fell out of their own <unk> , and by the <unk> mark , i only had # plugs left i 'm so glad i bought these with a gift card instead of my own -lrb- and very small -rrb- funds , because i 'd be even more angry at the quality of this product do n't buy it waste of your money and time
bought this not to long ago and already lost one plug they fall out easily when you put it in a sleeve or a back pack not worth it
i lost all of the plugs within a week i stuck them in and put the laptop in my bag and they just all fell out i feel like it would be better to just use a piece of tape to cover the holes when they are n't in use or something
i really like these they are a great idea ... in theory however , they fall out a lot in my case , while sitting in my lap , etc . so , they were cheap and i considered this might be a possible drawback but i thought i 'd give it a whirl i probably would n't buy them again or recommend them though
even after reading some of the reviews indicating that these plugs come out easily i thought i would give them a try i too found that they just will not stay in place and all it takes is to brush accross them with your hand or something else and they just pop out and end up on the floor
i loved the idea of having these in my laptop for protection against dust or dirty in my backpack at school however the pieces didnt stay in my laptop very well and i lost two or three of them on the first day if your laptop is staying at home in a study then i would recommend this product , however if you are going to be traveling with it i would just save your
you have to be careful the pieces do not fall out keeps the dust out but not very secure if your carry your macbook around ... then again are n't you supposed to carry it
the <unk> <unk> set arrived quickly and was exactly what i ordered the only problem is that the <unk> are very small and can be easily knocked out of their ports once they fall out it is hard to find them they are great for when i 'm not moving my computer around , it 's just a matter of being careful not to let them catch on anything and notice when they do fall out
i got these for my mac , but some of the covers do not fit accurately , therefore is easy to loose them i wish the fire wire tap is thinner , or that it fits the port , half of it stays out and i lost it really fast i decided to leave just the sd card cover -lrb- which best fits of all -rrb- and the <unk> cover but overall it accomplishes its main goal , cover the ports in your mac
these plugs do block the dust like i had wanted but when using the computer with them in , it blocks the airflow and the computer heats up very fast it cools down after removing the plugs
i love timbuk # products and feel that they are some of the most robust bags out there when the ram design came out , i loved the idea of a convertible <unk> bag that looked more urban i bought the first ram in <unk> # ; by early march , the backpack straps were tearing off at the shoulder attachment points i notified amazon , and the returns department immediately sent out a replacement bag well , it is just may # , and the second bag is showing the same failure mode note that i was n't even loading the bag that much -lrb- small laptop , couple of notebooks , pens -rrb- i just spoke with amazon customer service , who immediately took care of the return shipping -lrb- thanks <unk> ! -rrb- i am returning this bag and shopping for a different one i 'm very disappointed , as the design was perfect for me i 'd be interested to see if anyone else has had the same issues
i tried really hard to like this bag i 've been using multiple timbuk # products since # and i 'm quite disappointed by this bag i know and appreciate the approach of this bag -- <unk> hybrid -- but the materials , quality and build are really not worth the # that it 's <unk> at such a shame i had high hopes
i bought this as a gift for someone who needed an everyday work and sometimes travel bag - basically a briefcase - to carry papers , occasional books , pens , etc . or various travel carry-on items will be carried everywhere by hand , not messenger-style the requirements were specific and this is one of very few bags that fits them <unk> backpack straps , <unk> shoulder strap and grab handle - this one has all the carrying options not too large -lrb- even smallish messenger bags are too big -rrb- - this one fits comfortably on your back it could carry a <unk> laptop too , though it 's not being used for that durable - previous cheaper bags , while they worked ok , wore out , buckles gave way , threads tore this one is well made , carrying points wo n't give way unexpectedly reasonably attractive - the design is basic , clean , and color combination is subdued but not drab black , like many such bags price is on the high side - like all timbuk # products - but i think it will outlast , <unk> , and look better than cheaper options
its a great bag with lots of useful compartment very versatile as it can be a messenger bag or a backpack or a smart bag if the size is slightly bigger then this ram will <unk> the # stars
so i searched and searched for a messenger bag/backpack combo this bag was one of the only ones the video makes the bag look much more bulky than it really is it has convenient pockets , a nice size laptop insert with zipper and just feels good when carried as a messenger or pack great material and neat company
i love this bag it is super convenient and easily converts from messenger to backpack great for going from school to work or commuting on a bike lots of storage space , great for laptops , super durable
when i purchased this case i thought to myself `` how bad can a computer case be `` well i soon find out first off this thing arrived folded in half like a piece of cardboard ... which was fitting seeing as how thats about how thick it is kind of stiff and cheep feeling you get what you pay for there is nothing to this thing
for one its <unk> to big for my macbook , and the zippers are kind of an annoyance i was looking for more of a sleeve type of covering i know it was only $ # but the material even for that could be so much better and less cheap feeling
it will protect your laptop however it 's not as nice as the products for # bucks if you are looking for some thing just to protect it this will work
you paid what you get a normal macbook <unk> that fits perfectly for a mac pros : fits <unk> : the <unk> has a strong plastic smell needed to air it for a few days before using it that 's why i gave a # star <unk> # but overall , it does a good job for protecting the mac
this bag fits my mac well even with a hard case shell over my mac it also fits my charger if it 's rolled correctly it 's a great looking bag if you just want to carry it in your hands it 's a <unk> buy
product is great it is simple to use and protects my macbook just like i wanted i recommend this product to anyone looking for an inexpensive product to protect their macbook
do n't quite remember how much i paid for this laptop sleeve/bag , but the sleeve is flexible such that i can fit my ultrabook , transformer , and mouse in it that being said , it is a good laptop bag for any use but collision protection - for it is <unk> without any cushion <unk> it
this sleeve fits my macbook perfectly i really love it but the other reviews that mention a strong rubber smell were not kidding it is incredibly strong it even gave me a headache that first day i finally <unk> it and set it under a fan now it 's just a faint leftover smell i 'm hoping it eventually goes away
works well , the foam felt a little strange at first , as if i had crushed a honeycomb texture cardboard or something the foam eventually came back up and it <unk> smooth again good case , would suggest it to others
in the beginning , i anticipated the interior to feel a little bit different , but when i finally received the product i was pretty disappointed the inside feels very cheap , but you know what they say - you get what you pay for overall the case is not too bad , one of the pros is that the color is unique but the biggest con is that there is too much wiggle room -lrb- i also have a hard-shell case for my macbook but there still is too much room -rrb- i would recommend this product if you are looking for a temporary sleeve but if you are looking for something in the long run , do not get this
considering how much cheaper this was than the other cases i figured it was n't going to be of the best quality the sleeve feels cheap , but it fits my macbook well and considering i mostly keep my computer at home , i do n't mind the low quality
pleased with the cushy <unk> bought this case # years ago and since then one of the zippers has fallen off , but since the other one is still operational , it still works the way it
i just purchased a new laptop bag , which i was afraid would not have enough cushion for my macbook pro -lrb- # `` -rrb- that is why i made this purchase i just love this case i love the memory foam it seems to be a great protector for my laptop i have not really used this outside of the house at this point will post later if my mind is changed , but so far so good
not a very sturdy device - you have to handle with care we have had to send our 's back for service twice now due to issues with the video display
i 've tried two dual core aod # models , aquamarine and white keep in mind the white does n't look attractive at all , more like a plastic toy both have the bad <unk> of freezing while <unk> files over my home network , downloading files from internet or <unk> a netflix video once they freeze , you have to restart them from the power button it seems to be some problem with the wireless network <unk> i 've seen reviews about freezing also with the happy # line of acer i finally bought a purple gateway lt # u which is the dual core gateway equivalent of aod # gateway was bought by acer so they have very similar specifications but the <unk> does n't freeze it is very responsive and works perfectly while networking it is also very quiet and much more attractive than the aod # models
i brought this laptop for my # year old <unk> for christmas she loves it and said it is better than any other laptop she has worked on i loved how compact it was and that she will be able to carry it around easily when in school i would recommend anyone to buy this
i did n't know there was not an additional pocket for accessories i 'm looking for something less <unk> i already have a case like this but with two extra pockets and not adjustable shoulder strap i do n't much care for my own either i 'd reccomend this item to someone who is looking for a simple laptop sleeve with a shoulder strap
this product does the job i purchased it for - carrying my laptop , but it really looks far better in the picture the pattern had more resolution than it did in real life , as we 're the colors more brilliant if i knew what it actually looked like i would have chose another product as it is <unk> pink shade than a deep purple aside from that it 's does the job
very pretty , but the strap broke , and we have n't had it that long it may be better to just use as a sleeve when it broke the computer was in it luckily it does n't appear damaged
the color and design were as expected , but i was surprised at the <unk> maybe i should have realized since it was called a & # # ; sleeve & # # ; that it would be minimalistic it 's just that i expected more padding or protection for the computer to be carried inside this product would definitely be for someone who is not hard on their computer and who is very careful with it
i needed a case for my laptop and bought one at a store and it was supposed to fit my laptop and it didnt was thinking about going out to buy one at a local store then i thought `` amazon `` and i found one in less than # min and its beautiful not like the normal plan black cases
i just received the bag today in the regular mail , and loved it i 'm sure it 's to be a great accessory for the spring when i get to use it in my <unk> treks thank you so much - <unk> a
** update *** this case is really sturdy i was surprised but everything i need will fit right in there ! i received the product right away and was really pleased with the email from the company <unk> my of the status of my order i did think the color would be a darker purple instead of a `` wine `` color i also wish i have paid more attention that there was no shoulder strap but again those were all my personal problems for not paying attention i did n't realize it was a sleeve case bag but it does say that clearly in the description i 'm going to give this a shot but i think i will need something a little more sturdy in days to come we 'll see
i just got this item and i love it came in the condition i wanted the packaging was good would buy from this seller again one more thing the picture is showing it perfectly
stylish and durable and well worth the money i had checked around for a case to carry my computer and they were all the same black . . no style what so ever a little style and color is what i was looking for and just what i found and much cheaper than the ugly cases i had found in other websites and stores cute and i love it
this case is for me it fits computer good with a little extra room i love the beautiful butterfly design i like that it has a handle but also a shoulder strap this is perfect <unk> my computer
the size on this is listed wrong , it is for # . # inch laptops and not a # inch mac book i mean , it still fits but it bothers me that it moves around inside that does not seem secure to me make and color were as described and arrived in right amount of time
this product arrived in a timely manner , and it was exactly what i was hoping for the peacock is beautiful fits my # inch laptop plus charger and a few small accesories i recomend it
i bought this laptop case for my sister for christmas she loved it it is different - not a typical solid color or vera bradley like you see most girls her age using it fits great on any # . whatever inch laptop
if you like the design , i definitely recommend getting this case it is a perfect amount of padding to protect your computer if you <unk> it in your back pack along with your books i highly recommend it
i got this for my # . # hp laptop it fits nice and snug and then leaves a few inches before the zipper where i can stick a few small things in i have gotten a lot of compliments on this sleeve as well
i got this the beginning of the school year and it has been nothing but great it fits my toshiba satellite laptop like a glove i receive many complements for it the only negative comment was from my mom about how it looks like the <unk> logo i assure you that she 's crazy and that it looks fabulous
this is the only bag i could find to fit the dell tablet it is very well thought out with many pockets to store your things i usually carry a should bag for my mac , but starting to think i could get everything into this bag
i had used the alienware backpack for my m # , but found it had only enough space for the computer and one or two peripherals this bag is just about perfect for my computer i have yet to come close to filling it it holds all of my peripherals in the organization pocket , and when i 'm only carrying the computer , the side straps allow the bag to be more streamlined plenty of space to use as an overnight carryon on short trips that i want to bring my computer only feature i wish was different was the water bottle pocket - i would prefer something that the bottle did n't stick out the top ... but that is such a small gripe that it wo n't sway my rating
i have a massive toshiba x # . # laptop , i ordered the bag from toshiba and the straps broke the first time i used it , this titan bag holds my laptop securely and everything else i carry it is built way more robust than anything else i 've found and is well worth the price if it means i can carry my computer where ever i want beyond the pelican case i have for deployments this is my new go to bag currently <unk> # with power brick # & # # ; fire hdx # asus ta # tools , dvds , mouse ect . # binders and # <unk> have the collapsing straps pulled tight and there 's plenty of room for more ...
i bought this bag because i had been searching for a laptop capable backpack that would fit my behemoth of a laptop -lrb- asus g # vw -rrb- all of the reviews i read on other bags said that they had trouble fitting that particular laptop into bags that claimed # `` capable i figured the extra money for a guaranteed fit and the lifetime warranty would be worth it , and i was right i have been nothing but happy with this bag it holds everything i could possibly dream of putting in it i am a college student , and this bag holds all of my textbooks , in addition to my laptop , ac adapter , kindle , ipod , external hdd , all with room left to spare i have also gotten many compliments on this backpack my only complaint , which is n't really so much a complaint as a personal <unk> , is that there are so many pockets , it makes keeping track of things difficult sometimes
i 've been using this bag for months now and is quite better for what i had expected it to be you can carry literally everything there since you got plenty of space i like it that has a protective bag when it stars to rain and to protect everything inside especially your laptop works great with my # . # & # # ; laptop and does the work to protect it and hold it tight love the option that you can just unzip where the laptop goes to pass through airport scanners without taking out the laptop from your bag this bag works for everything if you are travelling this can make it up to everything you need
this backpack fits my big # `` laptop with plenty of room to spare the other compartments have plenty of space for anything else that i need , and the straps make it very comfortable to carry
i got this backpack for my husband for his birthday he runs his business on an # inch alien and he was complaining because it is so wide and heavy that it could n't find anything that fits it -lrb- i ca n't hardly lift the thing -rrb- my husband is on the go with a mobile business and he always takes his <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with him i have heard him brag to all his associates that he can get his computer , all his stuff , all the dog 's stuff and still have enough room to pack for a weekend he loves this bag and showed me at length all the detailed reinforcement , the waterproof shield , all the different pockets , etc . he has had it for about a year and it barely looks used i was worried because it cost quite a bit more than i was planning to spend on a backpack but has proven to be worth every cent i am sure this company has sold a few more of them due to my husband 's public praises
i just wanted to comment on this bag i love this bag i travel for my job and i carry my asus gaming laptop with me this bag was recommended due to the large size of the computer i purchased it in oct # i just noticed recently that the fabric was pulling apart from the zipper i started the process by sending a customer support email from their site and after sending the required documents including purchase receipt and pictures , they replaced the bag it took # days start to finish , i received my new bag today i would highly recommend this bag -lrb- great at airports too and fits in the smaller plane overhead compartments .
holds a tone of stuff so many pockets and features i forget where i put things in it holds from # laptops ; tablets , power supplies , etc . secure and sturdy great for travel
it has a lot of pockets and storage areas for your computer accessories my # & # # ; macbook pro stores nicely in the far back pocket and my ipad air fits perfect in the middle pocket i had this back pack for about # months now and its holding up great i 'm usually very hard on my stuff the shoulder straps are very comfortable too i would highly recommend this computer back pack
i ordered this backpack after reading the reviews and the backpack has met all my expectation my asus # . # & # # ; -lrb- screen size -rrb- laptop slides it quite comfortably leaving plenty of room of bunch of other items
i 'm a current college student who decided to buy a nice big laptop that weighs roughly # pounds so i needed a bag that would fit this laptop and offer considerable protection but that is not the sole reason why i bought this bag , the other is i commute around solely by my bike so making trips to the store requires a big bag which this one does <unk> i 'm so satisfied with this bag and the added lifetime warranty is just icing on the cake know that if this bag comes apart i can get a replacement
i liked it 's size , plenty space , many pockets and rain , dust cover it 's definitely better than my previous swissgear rucksack , but shoulder straps looks weaker than on swissgear may be they are <unk> 'll find out this after few months of using also it 's could be good to have better protection on the bottom , outside , like on swiss gear , for easy cleaning after half an year of using i 've changed from # stars to # stars i really like this , easy to carry , easy to open and show in security check area in airports and most thing i <unk> it full it does n't look like a big pillow , keeps good proportions and there are so many <unk> and with zip , so <unk> of all gadgets will give you a
i love this backpack i travel a lot and use it to carry my alienware m # x r # , ps # , and <unk> a # headphones everywhere everything fits well with plenty of room for all my accessories and games with room to spare it 's very comfortable when it 's all loaded with my gear my old alienware backpack was very uncomfortable and heavy with everything in it and the headphone did n't fit in that bag the design and quality of the <unk> # is great ca n't even tell that i 'm carrying a # lbs laptop in it tried a lot of backpacks and this is the best by far was a little worried when i ordered because of the cost , but after using it all i have to say is money well spent
incredibly well made attention to detail is key with the everki products in general takes all the `` punishment `` i put it through and fits everywhere comfortable and durable highly recommend it
nice and perfect product so it 's can contain all my stuff when i <unk> around the world i can take my laptop ipad and my hard disks any where any
everything i was hoping for , fits my g # laptop comfortably , with tons of room to spare for books etc . the price was a little <unk> but being this was pretty much one of the only backpacks to fit my laptop it was worth the investment love this bag , room for everything , i carry my ipod , g # laptop , beats headphones , full sized computer mouse , <unk> book -lrb- big -rrb- , etc . feel free to contact me with any questions if your considering buying it
i purchased this backpack for my asus g # . # inch laptop the laptop fits snug without any room to move but is still easy to take in and out much to my surprise , i was able to breeze through airport security without having to remove my computer from the backpack in addition to the computer 's weight , i carried several other larger and heavier items -lrb- with plenty of storage space to spare -rrb- i remained remarkably comfortable throughout my travels manufactured and engineered with superb quality pay the few extra $ $ $ , you 'll be glad you did overall # stars # % satisfied
gigantic backpack with space enough for a gaming laptop -lrb- i have an asus g # -rrb- , power cables , accessories , a change of clothes , and whatever else you might want travelled overseas with it , zero problems
great backpack for large alienware laptop does a great job of distributing weight so pack does n't feel heavy lots of great storage compartments and nice to have tsa zip pouch so you do n't have to remove your laptop when going through airport security
great computer carrier , plus room for everything else needed . # + fits easily , plus tablet , nice touch with the case to put your <unk> , mouse in i can carry two external drives , files , notebook with room for more
this thing is huge ! much bigger than i expected , but bigger is better for all the junk i carry around i anticipate air travel <unk> over the next year and in the future so i wanted to eliminate the hassle of unloading and loading first flight is # and i will update after <unk> after my first flight pro- i got through security no problem , just unzipped and laid it flat on the conveyor i only had to use # bin for my shows , belt and cell phone -lrb- which i could have put in the backpack had i been more aware -rrb- con - it 's just a little too big under the seat in front of me , especially since they are jamming in more seats i 'll just look for exit row seats on future
i have no issues with this product barely a whisper of <unk> with the shoulder straps i am # ' # & # # ; tall thus i am always searching for a little something more comfortable i would happily spend the dollars again for this level of quality , functionality and dependability as compared to the numerous backpacks i have owned over the last few years security checks at international airport , a breeze
i expected it to be more a purse for my laptop this will not fit under the airline seat very well . disappointed in the size , but do like the style and color
i bought this because i wanted it to work both ways as purse and laptop carrier i had to returned it is the size of a carry-on away too big for the small things with have today but i wanted something like that smaller with wheels and i can not find it
bought one of these for myself and for an instructor works good and holds a good amount of items a little tight when you first use it , just needs to be broken in
i love the look of this bag , but it is quite larger than what i had expected i was wanting something to use every day , but probably will not , as it is so large the quality , however , is exceptional and very nice in color
i 'm very pleased with my laptop bag it 's made my life so much easier the compartment on the inside hold my cell phone and wallet and now i do n't even carry my purse the only thing i caution people is the bag is very big so if you 're looking for something petite - this is not the one for you
i love this bag i needed a large tote for up coming trip to italy it is # & # # ; x # & # # ; x # & # # ; and <unk> with carry on standards of every airline i checked it can be carried by hand or over shoulder but if it is full a pull out extendable handle with wheels make <unk> a breeze
i get many compliments on this bag it definately ups the style meter for a computer bag is roomy enough to fit my computer , plus a makeup bag , multiple file folders , a cord bag , and more
this sleeve was a great purchase for # months , it worked great with my macbook air , but recently the velcro is coming loose not sure if it is poorly made or just that i <unk> my laptop it might just be one product default with the velcro strip and sewing , but it 's too much of a hassle to return this item i 'm still using until it completely falls a part on me
not a lot of cushioning , but it is ok for what its made for if you 're just looking for something to tote your computer around , it works as for protection it could be more padded
this material is not nearly as protective as i was hoping it 's very thin and squishes easily between your fingers the item is true to color , however , and works well in situations where minimal padding is enough
i was disappointed to find that this sleeve is more like thin foam than regular <unk> neoprene it is pretty cheaply made , but then it did n't cost much either it will keep things from being scratched , but i 'm skeptical of its impact resistance
i bought this to protect my macbook air in my larger work bag i throw * everything * in that bag and the sleeve protects my computer very well it does n't have a pocket for the power cord , so i end up shoving the cord in there with the computer , but there is plenty of room its holding up fine with wear and tear , but i 've noticed its starting to pick up dirt and looks dingy but overall , its just fine
to begin , i have a shell on my computer so it is a little thicker and wider than the naked computer other reviews report that this case is too over sized and does not fit the macbook air mid # & # # ; very well i find this works to my preference i throw my mouse and charger in with the computer and do n't worry about it since the computer has a shell on it i highly recommend this for the price and the thickness of the case it fits its purpose of protecting my computer during travel
very inexpensive option for a protective case the only minor negative is that the seams are not quite straight not a big deal for us - it 's my wife 's samsung chromebook and she noticed the seams but did n't mind we were slightly nervous about it fitting because we also got the ipearl mcover hard shell case which adds slightly to the dimensions without the hard case , it was just slightly loose in this sleeve after the hard case , it fit more snuggly , but still fit just fine as a note : this is a soft sleeve it adds protection for your laptop , but it is n't going to be total protection a fall onto a hard surface can still cause damage
i bought this for traveling with my # . # & # # ; macbook air the material seems cushy , but will probably deteriorate a little in time the sleeve is a touch large for the mba but not to where i 'm concerned about it sliding ; it holds the laptop well in place
light cover , perfect for putting in my backpack in between classes super cute and nice color too i recommend it , as long as that 's what you 're looking for
it holds and protects my chromebook , and maybe a few sheets of paper as well but i really got it to protect my chromebook , so if i was looking for more , well , that 's my own fault perfect for what it 's designed to do
this is a no-frills but attractive slip case that fits my chromebook it 's padded enough to protect it from scratches and dings , and the velcro strip on the <unk> closure is quite strong good value and seems durable just what i needed
