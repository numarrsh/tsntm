the price was great and the quality of the product was excellent i bought the bag for my netbook that i also purchased on this site i would recommend this product
tried to find an all <unk> carrier for my kindle my stylist my , charger , etc . this is great holds everything and not to big with a handle i really like
this case is well made and a great choice for the price i purchased it for an ipad the case is a little large for just an ipad , but i have a logitech bluetooth keyboard cover attached to it and everything fits perfect room in the pocket for the charger and cable
bought this for my boss as a gift he has a tablet and separate keyboard and this has enough room for both kind of a personal item so was concerned about him liking it but he loves it and uses it everyday
this is a great bag for carrying your ipad the handles are super convenient the bag is sturdy and also big enough to fit my ipad when it has a carrying sleeve on it for extra protection well , well worth the money
this is just perfect size and feel it has soft side for some <unk> bangs the handles are handy , and the small front zip pocket fits for the plug and <unk> or your cellphone good pricing , and arrived fast
i got this for my surface # , and it fits perfectly i was worried it would n't be quite wide enough , since the aspect ratio for the surface is different than an ipad , but it works just great the small pocket on the front fits the charging cable and my bluetooth mouse -lrb- microsoft <unk> comfort mouse -rrb- pretty well all in all , great bag
for the price , this was great i also updated the all black look by applying -lrb- fussing -rrb- a <unk> flower onto the front of the case wah la , instant personalized plane wear which helped locate my computer in a snap while <unk> found the case to have lots of pockets for accessories and even fit my laptop cooling pad , books and
this is really a great bag for my ipad air and i love the zippered pocket on the outside it is large enough to hold the charge plug as well as cleaning pads i gave one to my son as well
this is a real find a padded carring case for tablet type devices i really like three things here ; well padded , handles and a small <unk> pocket slight points off for the orange color inside , but not a deal
ca n't beat the price quality of this product is very good fits my ipad # with case and cover with room to spare front zippered compartment is nice and will hold the charger and cable this case can also hold larger items like a net book of a # inch tablet the material is soft but pretty stretchy nice work amazon
i 'm very happy with this case i wanted something to protect my new microsoft surface pro and hold the power cable and other tiny accessories this fits the bill the zippers are high quality , the handle feels substantial , and the front zippered pocket is perfect for the power adapter , pen and a portable mouse all at an unbeatable price and the orange inside is a nice touch
i have a <unk> on my ipad # , but i wanted a little extra protection for when i take it on the go even with the leather cover case -lrb- front & back -rrb- on my ipad , there is plenty of room i really like the handles -- it just feels so much more secure than with the cover only and i love the front pocket more than enough room for charging cord , my mini external speaker , ear buds , etc . nice way to keep everything all together , even if only using it at home
purchased this for use with a new l # . # netbook it is the perfect size and there is plenty of room in a zippered section in front for my wireless mouse very happy and highly recommended
it is a bit bigger than my ipad air needs , but not so much to be an issue i have walked many miles with it , and it is very strong i like the pocket in the front for charging converter and cables this is a lot better than carrying around the pad or just a light case it is not thick , but enough of a neoprene cushion to protect the pad well
i got this for my lenovo thinkpad and i love it it serves its purpose and has plenty of storage space for accessories i would definately recommend this to anyone that just needs a basic storage bag , not padding so i do n't think it would protect your laptop from a fall but for the money , what would you expect
i love this case my ipad fits wonderful in this bag a perfect fit , this bag allows no movement of your ipad if you want something small to grab and go , this is the bag for you
i found that amazon had their own label on laptop cases at such a reasonable price i am completely satisfied with the quality and function of this case it is just what i was looking for to put my husband 's new laptop in i like the double handles that <unk> both sides of the zipper no worries about the case falling open at the zipper the shoulder strap seems to be plenty sturdy if i were to make one design change it would be a thicker padding at the bottom to protect the laptop a bit better
great bag ! a bit large for my ipad , it is probably big enough for an ipad and a cover , but i feel that the ipad is well protected the side pocket is big enough for the power plug and maybe a few extras i also keep a small point and shoot camera in there and it too is well protected again , great price , would recommend it for ipad users
i bought this bag for my son and have no regrets my son can be rough on his things but the bag has held up for some months now it 's very similar to the case logic case that is for sale on amazon.com it fits a netbook , cord , and mouse all in it comfortably the price is second to none and the box it comes in was nice for <unk>
i purchased two of these bags one for me and the other for my wife we use these to carry our tablets in when we travel they are great that all i can say about them buy
been using this amazon case for my ipad # for a while now and love it , price was incredible , fits ipad perfect , has side pocket for accessories i use it every
i really love this i have been wanting one it sure beats sticking the i pad in my purse and having the chance of breaking it it is light and easily portable
i love the added protection this case provides for my ipad it has a small area to put my cord and <unk> in it even works with the case on it which is leather there is a good amount of room i plan to take it to florida and <unk> this will provide extra protection while on rides
the was a great buy for a case you can use a shoulder strap or just use the handle it is roomy for more than just a computer great for students i am satisfied with mine
what a great way to protect and carry your ipad it has a storage area in the front , i keep my charger in it but we 'll worth the price i love it , ca n't be beat
this is really a well made , heavy duty tablet case i purchased it to put my & # # ; asus transformer book t # ta & # # ; touchscreen laptop into this size case offers just enough extra room without being a tight fit there are plenty of dividers and pockets to put cords , chargers , manuals , etc . into
the bag fits my asus slider tablet very well the handles and the outside pocket are a nice advantage over over tablet sleeves though the inside is orange , the outside is a nice black i 'd probably cut off the tags if they were n't as soft as they are fits nicely into my backpack when needed , and the pocket is big enough for a usb drive and the power cable
i take my ipad everywhere with me this bag is perfect the second zipper compartment is perfect for a phone it 's a flexible fabric so it 's super easy to carry offers a second layer of protection for the ipad too
the size was just a little too small for me , so i will probably return it , but for the money the quality is outstanding now , somehow no one has mentioned the inner dimension of this case , here they are # . # x # . # x # . # in so if you have bigger than that you should not buy it , otherwise its a ` buy '
bought this for my kindle fire hd it was too big but i kept it i bought an asus netbook computer that fits perfectly there is a zipper pocket on the front that i keep the power cord and a mouse in while it is not a hard case it does provide some protection for the items inside and the handles on the side make for comfortable carrying of everything i am very satisfied with the price and the bag

when small is expected we downgrade a lot of things not in case of this product , it does justice by giving you lot of space without adding the bulk of weight i bought this for my asus t- # and it holds the tablet , its keyboard , mouse , external hdd , power unit in the main pockets apart from that it also has additional pockets for key rings , pen , notepad and other things it is still light and easy to handle around the only improvement could be with lot of travelling around , i fear the plastic buckles of the shoulder strap may not be able to last long it would be better if replaced with metal thanks amazon once again
this bag is a very convenient way to store your tablet and accessories in one place the fabric is cushioned to offer max protection while being roomy enough to hold everything more color options would be a definite plus but you ca n't beat the price
i wanted something that would protect my precious new ipad when i was n't using it , and also a place to keep its recharger to keep my cats from getting it this is the perfect fit for what i needed i keep my ipad in it when i am not using it -lrb- i can hardly put it down , though -rrb- and keep it next to my chair the cats can do no harm

i wanted a small bag i could use to carry my galaxy note pro # . # tablet and associated accessories to and from meetings and when <unk> that did n't require a full office worth of materials this bag fits the bill and is very well constructed with a great design and layout plenty of room for the tablet and essentials while being small enough to carry on my shoulder without feeling like a beast of burden the construction and finishing details are well done
light weight , rugged and roomie fits my # & # # ; asus memo -lrb- # model -rrb- tablet , a logitech bluetooth keyboard , aluminum tablet stand and the power charger there is a ton of room
though it 's cheaper than the equivalent case logic bag , this one looks literally identical save for the branding i really ca n't tell the difference as far as construction and materials go , and it 's a good padded bag for a # & # # ; laptop it comes with a shoulder strap and extra zippered compartments for accessories and a charger the material is mostly nylon fabric and clearly built to last i was able to fit a # . # & # # ; thinkpad t # into this , with the extended battery still attached it was close , but it fit that 's probably the thickest # & # # ; laptop around , so i 'm pretty confident this really can fit any # . # & # # ; machine ca n't argue with the cost and function if you need a travel case for your laptop , this is an obvious choice
very nice product for the money i am using it with nexus # and if feet perfectly , the pocket on the side is quite useful as well to store some cleaning cloth and headphones
this fits my dell inspiron mini # perfectly and there is room in the front pocket to fit the power cable , a small wireless mouse , and a usb cable for my phone the neoprene material is kind of stretchy so you could probably fit a little more the zippers are good quality thick plastic and i like the neoprene handles which more expensive versions i saw did n't have
small , well constructed little case with handles exactly what you need to both carry your ipad # and give it protection from the usual bumps and grinds of life will easily fit into a brief case or larger size handbag smart design with the little pocket for additional items well done - fits what you need at the right price love the <unk> packaging amazon

i ordered this case for a # & # # ; screen x # thinkpad computer the case allows a safe and secure encasement for the computer , the charging cable , a mouse and external speaker i easily fit a small <unk> drive in the side pocket this case is quite acceptable for its stated purpose and was delivered quickly and securely packaged i would order again from this vendor
this is a great product it beats the price and quality for all other cases out in the market i am thinking of ordering more of these its great stuff i would recommend this
this bag was a great price to hold my apple ipad it gives me just a little bag that fits it well not a lot of padding , but my ipad is in a safe cover anyway i would buy it again to carry an ipad or a tablet in
this is very well constructed and will provide great protection there 's plenty of room and i love the accessory pocket the zipper pulls are great i got one for my mother 's ipad too great price too
i received a <unk> for christmas i ordered this bag , and shortly before it arrived , i received a smaller one as a gift it fits right in this basic 's i-pad bag giving me a very good , safe cushion for the i-pad i especially like it because i can also carry the charger in the outside pocket , so i can safely charge up even while not at home
came exactly as described and in a timely manner i have never had a bad experience when ordering a product sold by amazon , but many when ordering through other sellers , so as far as that goes , i highly recommend buying items that amazon sells for this product , it is very well cushioned , i feel my laptop is very safe , and there 's many pockets for other items used with your laptop or tablet i 'm actually buying another one for my
we have four kindle <unk> in the family -lrb- two # inch , two # . # inch -rrb- , so i bought four of them these cases are perfect they are excellent quality i especially like the outside zippers where we can store our chargers and the price was perfect
i was n't sure this would fit my acer # . # `` notebook , but it fits it perfectly like a glove the soft neoprene material stretches and provides light protection the amazonbasics netbook bag is kind of like a hybrid sleeve/case consider it a sleeve with a handle and some storage space for a couple of accessories or small power supply as with all neoprene type cases/sleeves , protection is minimal , but will protect your netbook from scratches and minor bumps i 've replaced my bulky , old fashioned nylon computer case with the amazonbasics netbook bag , and i 'm very happy with it <unk> , not bulky , and easy to <unk> <unk>
this is the perfect , <unk> # & # # ; laptop bag for what i need : commuting back and forth to work it does n't have a lot of cushion so i would n't toss it around with a computer inside it but it perfectly fits my laptop which is # inches wide anything wider than that and i 'd recommend getting the # inch or bigger size bag it 's incredibly lightweight and small , not much room for accessories , but otherwise a great , good quality , cheap laptop bag
i was a bit skeptical at first ordering this item , but when it arrive -lsb- very quickly i must add -rsb- , i was very pleased please with the quality and the protection it provides my # `` mini laptop it seconds at a grab all little purse as well , it has zip out slots for holding keys and <unk>

i just got this for my new asus t # ta transformer book it 's the perfect size it feels sturdy , well designed , and has lots of good pockets and holders it 's hard to go wrong with amazonbasics
the netbook bag is amazing for carrying my tablet without worrying if it gets scratched if it falls it is also amazing because it is more secured then carrying it in my hand
the ipad fits just right in this bag , and i have been using it for five weeks now the liner inside is soft and protective the material outside seems well-made and attractive the outside pocket has sufficient room for the charger and cables it 's a pleasure to store and carry the ipad in this bag
when i got my new computer i was disappointed to discover that it did not fit into my old bag due the wider format of the screen when checking for bags i again looked for the name brand of the prior bag i was surprised to find this for the price the & # # ; name brand & # # ; was twice the price this has room for a lock cable , an extension cord , my portable hd and other small items the stitching seems secure and has some reinforcement i have been using it daily for a month now and i am completely satisfied hopefully it will hold up better that the name brand did with zipper problems after three years and one of the carry handles pulling loose the strap fittings are not metal , but the material used seems solid and strong enough amazon seems to have chosen a good supplier
bag is slightly larger than what i would have expected for my # . # tablet , i suspect you could fit a # `` in this nice padding and has a zipper pocket on the outside as long as you kept the back of your tablet towards the zipper pocket , i think you could safely store a charger in there without fear of cracking the screen handle is nice , over all seems like a good carrying option for my tablet
the laptop bag is an excellent value held our laptop , ac adaptor , wireless mouse , kindle fire , train tickets , and assorted other charging cables , papers , etc . used it on a # day train trip and could n't be more pleased it 's sturdy , well built and never failed to provide protection it 's a good deal
