pretty good quality light , looks good interior lining is appreciated zippered pockets are a plus kind of hard to fit a macbook pro # inch size laptop , or larger ; barely slides in , but it does fit and it does and seems secure
only giving # stars because the complete lack of pictures this product has i may not have bought this bag because it does in fact have velcro strips to keep it closed and i hate the velcro noise , especially in a professional environment other than that this bag is great and i 'm glad the velcro did n't cloud my judgment perfect size for what i need and they sent me a free <unk> bag which is actually really well made also will most likely be ordering the other # colors in the future so i have some options if a simple canvas bag with zipper pockets is what you 're looking for then you ca n't beat this price and quality
i bought this to carry my # & # # ; laptop , and it is perfect for that job if you are looking for something that has crisp , flat edges , this is not for you the edges wrinkle and roll quickly , and outside of <unk> this , it looks <unk> pretty fast , but that only adds to its charm
nicely built and very roomy would have given it # stars if it had some rigidity to it would be better for a larger laptop instead of my ipad and misc books still very useful and great bargain
it 's a # star for the price i gave it # simply because it 's not super rugged or thick it 's better then i was expecting when i bought it though
i was attracted to this bag by its spacious dimensions , the economical price , by its cool <unk> color and because it looked sturdy this bag is almost all that i thought it would be the only minor drawback is that if you want to use it as a laptop bag , you should pad the inside with some styrofoam , or some other packing material even though the bag 's fabric is strong , it is not strong enough to absorb an impact to your laptop
seems like a good bag i use it to carry random things from time to time but it did not work for what i intended it for . it does not fit a # inch laptop and
i got this so in the warmer months , when i wear less , i can carry a change of clothing , then my dirty uniform , back and forth to work it 's sturdy and roomy with a bunch of extra pockets a fine purchase
i just needed a bag that could carry a few items around such as snacks , bottled water , etc . i like that it has # zippered pockets under the main flap and then one zippered pocket inside the main compartment a # inch laptop will not fit into the bag well , but who uses those any more i am mostly satisfied this bag is what it says it is ... it is military grade canvas bag it is n't pretty , it is utilitarian and gets the job done i dressed mine up using buttons and such and so it is now a unique bag the main flap has velcro and the two side pockets are open for water bottles and such the strap is comfortable for me as it is relatively wide and adjustable
this is such a great bag sturdy , reinforced where it should be , good pockets it is even made of a material that accepted iron on adhesive so we could personalize it the only thing that kept it from being five stars was that the opening zips and is just about # s of an inch too small for easily stowing a laptop we still love it , but had to do some surgery to make it not require three or four minutes of struggle every time the computer was pulled out or stowed for the price , though , this is one terrific bag
this is a very simple book bag i would n't recommend it as solid way to protect laptops or hard drives , but its definitely a nice affordable book bag it is not weather proof of course
it is n't pretty but it works i work in <unk> so does n't matter , its so very dirty there but for most , i would say order a color other then <unk> this is a hand , strong useful ... but ugly
so i bought it to use as laptop bag for my # inch laptop but it works much better for my # inch works well though it does n't have a lot of padding i can fit my # inch laptop in the bag but it 's tight if you are only using it for a laptop back with no books you wo n't have issues getting it your laptop in and out i needed it for more than just my laptop so i switched out to my # inch laptop for school and i carry a small # inch binder and a book -lrb- when necessary -rrb- much easier to get stuff in and out and it has multiple side pockets for pens , calculators water bottles -lrb- two end pockets for <unk> and two front pockets for pens power charger , calculator , etc . it also has a back pocket -lrb- pouch -rrb- that runs the entire bag for a that is good for a binder or notebook
very nice bag fits all of my things comfortably and still has a little wiggle room left over only downside is that the velcro that closes the back section ripped the second i opened it , but i do n't really need that part to close up anyway beautiful material otherwise , has a strong canvas feel very happy , would purchase again and again
it 's sturdy , but without any rigidity if you want a sold bottom , you 'll have to make one -- which is easy to do i found the bag 's main flap to be useless and a nuisance , so i carefully removed it with a seam <unk> the front pockets and main compartment are now much easier to access it has seven separate <unk> areas , a good strap , and is very versatile it 's not fancy , but it does the job
good solid bag , only gripe is the zipper handles i guess you would call them slip to the side at times and you have to <unk> with them to use the zipper
got a black one and an olive green i put my mac book , charger or my chromebook and stuff in here strap adjusts for a nice length , pockets on either end for more junk two pockets under the flap with zippers and a pocked on the outside that can hold a notepad or papers yes it 's & # # ; floppy & # # ; but the material is sturdy i like it
this bag is super cool . wish i had it earlier , enough pockets and great sturdy material to do the trick and i think visually stunning too , just do n't want anyone else to have it
i really love this bag for school i debated for a long time which bag to buy in this category because a lot of them had varying reviews that made me think twice i ended up buying this it 's bigger than i expected but it 's a good , sturdy bag for me
good quality , excellent price , perfect to use like a bag for office time and for weekend -lrb- no too small or too big for both -rrb- , and you could put in the washer machine
its a good size to fit a laptop , has two pockets under the flap on the front and # on each edge on the side . and one thin pocket on the back good thin objects also a pocket inside the main pocket
carried this on cross country flight as a carry on very heavy canvas construction that appears to be well made also carried in into a tree stand loaded with gear during a deer hunt larger than i expected will carry full size lap top and lots of extras or a change of clothes including shoes pretty satisfied with this product
perfect for pretty much everything sweet pocket <unk> -lrb- and <unk> -rrb- make this convenient for travel , work , adventures , school , <unk> , water <unk> , swimming , sky diving well you get the point
bag itself is very nice and very good item for the price if you are looking for a plain messenger bag then this is perfect choice and do n't look anywhere else however , at the moment of purchasing this bag i did n't know about <unk> of cycling messenger bags such bags have additional strip , so you can easily bike with messenger bag on you back , but use it as a plain messenger bag otherwise if you are looking for a messenger bag to use daily i would recommend getting a cycling one
it is what was described in the listing i only have # issues and they are really just nitpicking first , the flap is supposed to be held closed by velcro but the velcro on the bag does n't line up with the velcro on the flap unless the bag is stuffed to <unk> the second issue is the zippers the little things you grab to pull the zippers are <unk> and tend to get stuck in a position that makes it difficult to use the zipper sorry if that makes no sense
nice understated look material seems sturdy in the times i 've been using it only complaint would be the small side pockets as it is hard to fit a water bottle in the space
two water bottle pockets , can snap closed two zipped pockets under the flap , flap velcro 's to pockets perfect size for mouse and charger zipper ` ed main pocket , no padded laptop slot fabric is very durable . velcro pocket slot on the back of the bag thick shoulder strap , not padded i mainly picked this bag so i can modify it myself , i added two pen and pencil holders and an inside velcro strip to hold cables and other stuff with daily use for school for # months now , hardly any signs of wear dont get this if you want : lots of pockets , padded inside -lrb- b/c your clumsy -rrb- , and laptops bigger than # & # # ; -lrb- screen size -rrb-
i bought this to hold a lot of heavy <unk> books and papers , pens , dice , sketchbook , file folio ... it works great does n't look like a purse like the other bag i attempted to purchase before this one the bag seems pretty rugged , i pretty much abuse this thing its currently crammed behind my fridge , and looks as good as the day i bought it
if you 're looking for a tough and low cost bag , this is it nothing fancy about it and would be nice if it was a little bigger got me through class with some heavy books
i like this bag 's look and feel and use it to carry my tools when heading to another site i do it work and so this holds a couple <unk> boxes with screws , ethernet and phone cable tips , <unk> , screwdriver , cable <unk> , etc . there are a couple small pockets , but it 's mainly just a big pouch and it does what it is meant to do the seams could be a bit stronger either in the stitching or if they 'd been reinforced at all the opening would be great if it would open a bit more do n't try to put a # . # & # # ; laptop in here - even without a sleeve it wo n't fit well if at all , and you 'd want the padding anyway
great bag , roomy i like the two large side pockets , good for water bottles only thing that could make it better is if it were a bit stiffer material , or have some sort of framed support for the base and back
i wanted something plain and simple that also did n't look tacky and cheap and yet could take a beating this is it i love that it has a spot for a water bottle on the sides so <unk> from it does n't get all over my stuff on the inside i almost went for a similar product , but came across this one and realized it has zippers in the front pockets so all my stuff wont slide out i love the brass hardware rather than something plastic that i would probably break if you plan on carrying a lot of books without a coat on you might want to get a padded thing that goes on the strap i 'm considering this myself , but its coat weather most of the year in ny state
i gave this only # stars because the zipper pulls get snagged sometimes , and can be a bit of a pain to get fixed otherwise , i could n't be happier with the bag
this has to be the absolute nicest military messenger bag you can find i love the nylon lining ! ! ! everything is of the highest quality the canvas is super thick and tightly <unk> , the zippers , strap , and buttons could n't be nicer has a great inside zippered pouch built into the lining that is genius , and two front pouches under flap are zippered my only complaint , that keeps it from # stars , is that the zipper pulls are square and get caught up when you try and zip/unzip , the zippers themselves are fine , just the pulls
it 's really good for what its made for lots of pockets that are surprisingly big it can fit most things i use it for just about everything now the only minor <unk> are that the pull part of the zippers are square instead of rounded , so they get stuck in a weird position and it 's annoying fixing it every time it 's either try to set it straight again , or just open the zipper with it messed up also , the huge velcro patches make it hard to open up the flap , plus it makes a loud noise other than that , the bag is great
works best if you load it up as there is no <unk> rigidity and may sag with only a few items looks great and not pretentious recommended , especially for the price
solid bag if you value simple design hardware -lrb- metal hooks for strap -rrb- could be better pros : made of durable <unk> two <unk> small zip pockets to hold pens , cards , flash drives , <unk> stick , <unk> etc . one big pocket for laptop -lrb- i use <unk> # -rrb- , paper notebook , and some folders and a smaller <unk> for <unk> cons : metal pieces seem to be a cheap <unk> , looks like they may break easy not related to the bag but the style , it 's terrible for your back - i switched back to a two strap backpack and only use this when customer facing
my husband travels for work and need some kind of bag to put the laptop , snacks and misc in when he flies . i saw this on amazon and read the reviews and decided to buy it i was pleasantly surprised when it came very durable and heavy bag ! it has so many pockets in it ... one inside , two on the front , two on the sides and one in the back ! so much room for all the things that he takes with him on his trips ! so glad that i bought this and really highly recommend it ! !
this bag has all the <unk> you need in a bag i carry all my files everywhere i go in this bag it works perfect for me theres no reason to get any other bag then this in my case
love this messenger bag i can stow a ton in it , even my laptop fits although its a bit flimsy to trust it in there alone love the color , love that there are lots of pockets and zip areas i 've been using it for about two months and it has n't worn in any <unk> way with heavy daily use i work in a dirty factory and it barely shows anything
great size , great capacity , yet not too big excellent material and very sturdy construction excellent messenger bag many pockets and the main compartment has great capacity for bulky items great for everyday use as expected and <unk> in advertisement worth to have
this messenger bag was perfect i wanted a new bag for my laptop and wanted to step away from a traditional laptop case this bag fits my # . # asus laptop it 's snug but it fits and it fits all it 's peripherals and other stuff too it is heavy duty and well made i am very happy
would make a great non-descript camera bag i use this with a bbp camera insert when i want to carry more of my micro four thirds gear strap is actually comfortable but i use the <unk> us postal pad when carrying more gear it has a velcro closure and i just use velcro pads from dollar store as silencers ... just take it off when you want more security
i use this bag for work every day instead of my backpack i can fit my lunch , <unk> , and all sorts of pens , pencils , and flash drives i also throw a couple text books in there just fine i bought mine one week , then my wife bought the same one two weeks later
this bag is military grade canvas it is a quality bag that could serve many different purposes , from laptop , to travel , to <unk> pouch and so on i would definitely buy this product again so durable that it should last for years to come
used for college , # days a week holds a giant <unk> and giant <unk> book along with # notebooks in the main compartment with no problem glasses , wallet and keys fit with plenty of room in the # front zipped pockets , and the inside zipped pocket holds more pens , markers and highlighters than you would ever need very happy with purchase
excellent bag , very happy with it the size is perfect it has various compartments and can hold a lot i took it on a trip and was so thankful to have it on the plane
it 's very functional and seems to be made with high quality there are plenty of pockets and places for me to put all of my electronics and other things loving it so far
my boss ' bag was soon to be gone but he liked the messenger style so when i saw this one in similar color it was <unk> he changed that day and walked out with the bag in tow wonderfully built and very well put together i would recommend this bag to any one searching for a gift for a man that needs to carry his things around very understated
super spacious and holds tons of stuff can hold my school books , my <unk> bag and my lunch w out <unk> it awesome price for an awesome bag
i really enjoy the ease of carrying documents , food items , and my coffee mug on the outside pocket my only issue is the zipper it works fine , but the company should have used more a robust zipper this is not a deal killer , just an observation i recommend the bag
this bag is sturdy and holds everything that i need for school holds i pad , books and paper , also hold water bottle i am extremely satisfied with this bag and recommend it for anyone who is going to college
i picked this up looking for a simple black bag with a quality shoulder strap , preferably with a water bottle sleeve , that could work either as a work bag or a carry on for flights this fills all those needs the water bottle sleeves are a little tight which i prefer i 'm happier knowing my bottle is snug and secure the main pocket is quite roomy and can handle my chromebook , a book , notepad , and a snack one small note : i did run into trouble when trying to bike with the bag on my shoulder it liked to shift forward into my lap , forcing me to move it to my back constantly no stars removed as this was n't part of what i was looking for at purchase
i 'm a courier for a large firm , and we require a lot of documentation <unk> , <unk> , etc . , that involves carrying around very sensitive and important paperwork this messenger bag is perfect for what i want to do , it has plenty of spaces to carry around my documents and other sensitive materials that i do n't want to lose or have stolen while i 'm not usually a ` stylish ' kind of guy , this bag is very nice to carry around and you still feel kind of manly being able to do so
i use this for work to carry a laptop , ipad , papers , folders , etc . the zip pocket on the inside is perfect for pens and small items the outside # zip pockets work well for chargers , etc . the whole case zips shut if you feel you need to do that , but i usually just shut the flap and let the velcro hold it the strap opens very long and can also go quite short if you want to carry this by hand i like this because i feel comfortable carrying it into a professional office as well as casual settings note that there is no padding or structure to this bag it 's just canvas if you tend to throw your bag around with laptops or electronics in it , then consider something padded
i will not <unk> when i bought this bag i was a bit skeptical it seems kinda cheap and boring in the pictures but with all the good reviews i bought it anyway it 's been a fantastic bag , its high quality , easy to cary , everything has a zipper except the side parts the bag is built to last , and though it is a bit boring , is a great value if you are looking for a high quality yet inexpensive messenger bag , look no further
very nice military style messenger bag the best i ever had well constructed , with heavy duty canvas . seven pockets with lots of room , the main compartment is lined with polyester for added durability wide fully adjustable strap for <unk> <unk> i think anyone would love this bag
i bought it in olive , and its my everyday laptop bag i have a huge # inch lenovo gaming laptop and it fits nicely in here with room for other things the many pockets are also very convenient i love the adjustable strap , the <unk> , and the price -lrb- : i ca n't imagine this thing breaking down , it 's very well made
i ordered this bag over the dozens of similar options because of the good reviews and the price so far , i 'm very happy with the bag - heavy canvas , so far seems very durable - well made - clean , classic look - big enough for laptop or textbooks - # <unk> - wish the shoulder strap was slightly
i love the bag it 's sturdy which is awesome cause it can take a beating i take it everywhere i go shipping was super fast i love the bag
i bought this bag to double as a laptop bag and personal items bag so far it 's been perfect i love the simple design and the military bag theme it has and the quality is great i have seen no signs of wear yet and i tote this thing everywhere i see it lasting me a long time shipping was fast as well all around # % satisfied
got what i paid for and it was probably better than what i expected this bag is going to last me ages and i <unk> it 's pretty cool too
this seems like quite the durable product i bought two of the black ones and the exterior is quite rugged and seems it will take some serious abuse bag has quite a few pockets although some are kinda small however for me this works quite well since i only needed it for lugging my stuff back and forth to work whether on foot or by bike the drink holder is rather small and really not exactly worth using all in all the inside material seems kinda cheap but i havent had the bag long enough to know that for sure i would recommend the
i have many similar bags of this type and this one is the best hands down the materials and the quality of the craftsmanship is military grade i highly recommend this bag
i received this as a present and it 's an excellent bag many pockets -lrb- # smaller outer pockets , one large pocket -lrb- laptop -rrb- , one hidden pocket , # side pockets and one rear pocket -rrb- it 's very sturdy and carries everything with ease my only complaint is that since it 's cloth , it dirties rather easily i do n't really mind though
bought this along with my bbp dslr camera insert , and they make quite the pair there is enough room inside to place a small water bottle or another tele lens or flash i like to leave the pocket outside for water bottles or keys it looks a feels like a quality product but after all it is made of canvas so it should be pretty good
i was very skeptical after reading <unk> # star reviews that this can not possibly be the perfect bag for anybody i finally decided to take the plunge after my old bag finally kicked the bucket all i can say is that i should have purchased this bag sooner it looks and feels sturdy and can hold a number of things inside the fact that it has a velcro flap is an added bonus for easy access into the compartments if you are looking for a simple bag to carry & # # ; stuff & # # ; every day , this is a good & # # ; stuff & # # ; holder just do n't expect a canvas messenger bag to be <unk>
i use this bag for school and for transporting my laptop on weekends most bags i have purchased for those things would start to rip somewhere about a month after purchase , but this one is just as good as new i highly recommend this item , especially for college students
it has tons of space and a lot of pockets i like to carry a lot of items with me every where i go and this bag has plenty of space and it looks awesome
nice bag that 's not too big or too small the side pockets fit my # liter camelbak water bottle nicely the strap is nice and wide so it does n't hurt my shoulder after a while of carrying it around
i got this as a christmas present and have had it for about # months now i use the product daily if not with school books , then with my laptop the product is extremely durable i love the adjustable strap
the material on this backpack was awesome ! ! its thick and the velcro on it works fantastic if you need a backpack <unk> get this one you will be happy with
my husband and my nearly # yo love this bag great substitute for a backpack and seems to be made from a very durable material hoping this will last for years
bought this bag for my college bound <unk> , she loved it large enough for school books and binders , at the same time she uses it to pack for a quick trip home very durable , very appealing
this bag is the perfect size for a laptop or tablet with room for other things like papers , water bottles , wallet , and cell phone this bag is well made and will last a long time i liked it so much that i bought an olive colored one for a family member they love this bag too
after looking all over the internet and in brick & mortar stores , i finally found a messenger bag that was perfect for me it has two side pockets , two front pockets and a main compartment that zips and an inner pocket in the main compartment that also zips it has large , but shallow pocket on the rear of the bag -lrb- great for carrying a newspaper or magazine . my one little gripe would be that it does n't have a small handle at the <unk> of the bag so you can pick it up without using the main strap not enough of an issue to dock it any stars though
this is a great bag it is very durable and seems well made i like the look of it too it is rugged but could be used for anything i 've been using it as a camera bag it 's got plenty of room for my dslr and a couple lenses with a camera insert i can also see myself using it for work or anything else really good all around
i was looking for a rugged style messenger bag to carry my work things in it needed to hold a portfolio with a pad of paper in it , a tablet , and <unk> a laptop well it hold all of that plus chargers for those devices and some small snacks it is just what i wanted the canvas feels good and sturdy
this is a military looking bag and has lots of room for a lap top and tons of other stuff i use it to lug my goods back and forth to work everyday nice outside pockets to drop your keys into or a bottled water the front zip pockets under the front flap hold other small objects you can get to easily it could be worn across the body but if you are smaller , then it probably wo n't work as well as just carrying it on the shoulder it has a nice wide strap which really removes the cutting into the shoulder and making the bag seem too heavy it 's a great going to work bag
has just enough pockets to let me take the essentials with me main pocket easily handles my surface pro # and headphones , etc . this replaces a leather bag that i had for years and i really like the canvas much
got this bag for myself as an adult college student it has a lot of storage and i am completely satisfied with the bag itself it is exactly what i was looking for however , the packaging was just a bit ridiculous they literally stuffed this bag into a usps paper envelope let 's just say by the time i got it there was a huge tear in the package and i am lucky that the bag was not damaged
for all you murse users out there this is one great bag got quite the many pouches for carrying whatever you 'd like nice and <unk> for a laptop tablet and whatever else
i hate leather bags inside has a protective fabric from your things getting soaked although i 'm sure they 'll still get wet if you leave it in the rain too long good amount of pockets very roomy . # stars
this is a nice solid bag has zippers on all the pockets side pouches big enough for my liter water bottle like the color . the strap is a little uncomfortable to carry for a while wish it was a little bigger
i bought it to carry my laptop while not looking like a fancy laptop bag so a thief will target me the bag is well made and looks good i only wish the holes on the zipper pulls were rounded so they would n't catch when you zip things closed , but that is a very minor inconvenience - not even worth a one star docking
if youre looking for a simple messenger bag for a decent price then this is the bag for you its big enough on the inside to fit a <unk> # my husband loves this bag the material is great too
i can fit my # & # # ; laptop and ipad very comfortably i also throw my lunch in there most days with # issues i also like the # water bottle holders on the sides i would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a messenger bag
i carry my # & # # ; fairly heavy work laptop with this bag , and it 's been holding up solidly the strap does n't <unk> , but it does n't really need to the material is sturdy and it looks great if you do have to carry a very heavy weight for a long period of time , i 'd probably recommend going with a backpack messenger bags are n't great for the back but for short trips , or reasonable weights , this bag really does the trick
love it ! was just as described and seems to be well made would work well for an over night bag i purchased it for a camera bag and it works awesome for that
the bag seems fairly sturdy , and is nice and big the pocket on the back is just the right size for my inspiron dell laptop which i never travel without , so the bag is perfect for short vacations
this is my # nd order of this military bag i ordered my first one about # years ago and it was so durable i just fell in love its my ultimate go to bag , i used it in college , and several years after this bag has been with me to europe , <unk> and africa , it lasted me for years , is very sturdy i never leave it at home definitely the most bang for your buck
i was reluctant at first in purchasing my first man purse i quickly fell in love with it i use it to carry my notebooks , # books and an ipad air it can fit a good amount and it looks good it 's gotten me to drink more water cause of the two cup holders that felt empty at first , so i filled with bottles of <unk> water that i just <unk> with normal water like everyone else anyways , the material seems sturdy and i like how it does n't have any large logo or brand i removed the dog <unk> cause it 's just weird would recommend purchasing a soft <unk> that cushions your shoulder on the strap if you plan on carrying a lot of things for a long amount of time i personally do n't use one , cause i just use my sweaters hood and enjoy looking awkward good product , definitely recommend
wo n't carry my # . # & # # ; laptop but i knew that when i bought it perfect for my school books , as a brief case for work and used it as a camera bag on my last vacation strong , versatile , looks good , what more could you ask for
i bought this as a gift for my boyfriend , and he totally loves it it was bigger than i was expecting , which was a huge bonus it 's incredibly sturdy , and i do n't think it 'll have a problem wearing out too soon definitely would buy again
this bag is maybe the best bag i have used in a long time holds many items , is very versatile , and is very comfy love the bag if it broke i would simply buy another
bought this to replace my aging messenger bag and this meets full expectations the bag fits my # . # in acer # g laptop perfectly and has room to spare for the power cord and my mouse just in the main compartment the bag has two front pockets i use to store my external hard drive , usb drives and adapters plus the cables along with pens and every day carry items the inside compartment also has a small zippered pocket that i use to store money in and on the outside of the bag is a pocket i use to store my books in overall great purchase
this is one of the rare times i was extremely satisfied with an online purchase i use this bag on a daily basis and unlike other messenger bags , it is made out of a very durable material without holes or tears it 's quite spacious without being chunky i love it and recommend it -lrb-
just the right size , very durable , i have carried everything from computers to tools , makes a great overnight bag because of the <unk> pockets , strap is adjustable and very long overall a great
this bag arrived as described and has enough room to carry a bunch of art supplies -lrb- sketch book , pens , pencils , erasers , etc -rrb- , a few magazines and enough room for more this is perfect for what i needed
