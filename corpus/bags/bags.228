i bought this to carry my # & # # ; dell laptop and i am very satisfied it is nicely padded and has enough space for the laptop and accessories with out being too big and bulky
this is a great bag this is my second one this is a replacement for one i bought # years ago bag is very good quality and well constructed would <unk> to anyone looking for a good laptop bag
i have an # . # `` asus gaming laptop and this laptop case is great even with the laptop being so big as well as heavy , this laptop case is perfect for my needs lots of storage area , very good buy
it 's got all the right pockets in all the right places , and the padding right where it needs to be i have an over-sized # `` <unk> laptop with accessories , and fits really well in this case , with plenty of room to spare it is very sturdy -lrb- targus has a good reputation for that -rrb- i 've had it over a year and there are absolutely no signs of wear and tear , despite being on the road for a good bit of that time update : after two years now , and constant traveling , the case is still holding strong it looks like it 's in mint condition with absolutely no wear i now carry the laptop , presentation materials , a small projector and marketing brochures everywhere
this bag has all the space one would ever need quality product which fits my # inch laptop with room to spare love the outside and inside pockets for cords , mouse , and papers
this is plenty of bag for my # . # inch laptop and it has a great little bag for my power supply and tons of storage for misc . discs and paperwork i love this bag
i had a targus case previously for a # `` laptop and was totally pleased with it this one is equally well constructed and the laptop and basic accessories fit in it just fine it 's not bullet proof , but i do n't want the bag to weigh a ton either , so for me it offers the protection and convenience i want
this bag has everthing i need there 's plenty of storage space , ample pockets and a <unk> space for power cords , etc . the handle is sturdy and it has a rugged bottom surface that allows the bag to stand up and hold its form i was pleasantly surprised at both the quality of the product and the internal space a good buy
i bought this laptop case as a gift for my <unk> for a complete package of laptop , mouse , modem , and laptop case that i sent to him in another country after a while using it he is more than happy with the case i first got it in another store and it cost me # bucks more , i returned and then got it here saving me money
great bag for a large laptop very durable and i can fit my cooler master laptop <unk> in it as well as many other compartments for other peripherals for my gaming on the go
what else can i say <unk> this case it is made very well and is durable i use it everyday and love that it has enough pockets & storage for all kinds of stuff it fits my # `` dell laptop very secure like a glove pros : everything , very secure and well built , great value for protecting your laptop cons : nothing as of now
love it plenty of room for the pc <unk> batteries , and <unk> mat with other <unk> for other things , would buy from company again if need too hope it lasts a long time
purchased this in order to carry around my bar <unk> equipment it works great there is so much room for storage and its easy to carry also , by far cheaper here than at office max , etc .
for a # `` laptop this is the best case it has pockets everywhere for everything that you can think of carrying and more but one of the best things that is on this case is that you can buy a lock and put it on to lock up your laptop in the case
i ordered this bag online a little scary since i was n't sure <unk> what it would look like , plus i wanted to be sure it would fit after contacting amazon , i was assured the # . # `` screen would fit perfectly in this case and it does the greatest part about the case is it is either a roller bag , a carry by the handle bag , or a shoulder bag it is perfect for me and my wife 's needs i researched for hours before deciding on this bag and i 'm a happy camper and so is my wife ! !
i needed a computer bag to take on long trips i have a # & # # ; laptop and this bag can actually handle it i use it all the time now my wife has a computer bag and we both drag our computers wherever we go
all i hoped it would be ... large enough for my large laptop , lots of extra space for other things which i really do n't use , but nice to have well made , great price , great to shop with amazon
targus is excellent for the way the bags are made , this is a bag big enough to fit any one of the # laptops that i need from time to time it 's sturdy and even with the heaviest laptop i have not that heavy to carry especially if you are a lady as i am it 's a great price for a great bag well worth it
i bought a # . # inch laptop and could not find a `` # inch `` case to fit it by other manufacturers i finally found this targus that gives plenty of room and about one inch more on each side of the laptop when placed inside the case it also comes with pouches to hold wires and other laptop accessories only <unk> was i wished it had stiffer material on the top , ie plastic , so that if something is placed on top of the case while it is standing that it will not sit directly on the laptop
totally perfect and rugged have had this for several years now and no issues great value for the buck , has been on many plane rides and other trips and still looks new and aesthetic
this is a great quality case for my laptop there is an adjustable divider so it holds a variety of sizes and even with a larger laptop , you can carry accessories
i bought this same case about # or # years ago i 'm really hard on cases and just now the zipper failed on the original one i bought just ordered the replacement and i 'm sure it will also serve me well for years it 's easy to get in to , has lots of pouches for lots of storage ... and did i say it can take a beating ?
i purchased a new # inch screen laptop but had a hard time finding a case that it would fit into my new laptop fits perfectly into the # inch targus <unk> case and it 's a great find it also opens like a suitcase so the laptop just lays down into it and it 's nicely padded
we bought this for our new aluminum macbook to protect it when it is in a larger bag the outside pocket was an added bonus when we looked at the description but when it arrived it was too large for the laptop , in that it was extremely loose inside of it and felt flimsy i had purchased a case for my older ibook and it had something built into it that made the case slightly more rigid and protected case logic gives a good warranty , but this did not meet our needs and we returned it
i bought this for a dell xps # . # `` with the # cell battery it fits perfect good little case it has a strong odor of synthetic chemicals -lrb- rubber -rrb- when i first removed it from the packaging though other than that , i am pleased
i love this sleeve it perfectly fits my # `` macbook and power cord i feel a lot safer when i have my computer protected in there the only thing i might change is to have a little handle or something just for added <unk> that i do n't drop it i would def . buy this again if i had to
this case is definitely <unk> in color , but it definitely provides scratch protection there is also a sleeve that can fit a power cord tightly , but is probably meant for a jump drive or disk
great case , good material -- fits my macbook perfectly i received a navy case with grey interior rather than the lighter blue and orange interior i was expecting but i sewed rainbow handles on to it to make it easier to carry and to brighten it up would definitely recommend this product
fits my mac perfectly i love how it has the pockets on the front for easy access to cables and anything else i wish it was a bit more padded to protect my laptop but it gets the job done to throw my <unk> into my bag
i bought this case and am quite happy w / it i had n't thought it would be so tight on my macbook does n't leave much room for <unk> , etc . still , i 'd buy it again great case , good price , looks cute -lrb- mine 's red -rrb-
i have bought # of these now . . every time i have a friend that sees it and also has a macbook i end up having to give it to them and getting myself another during my # rd purchase i looked around for new items maybe that came out since . nope . . this is still the best for macbook # . # . it carries my macbook , extra batter , my apple remote , and my headphones the <unk> at the top makes it easy to pull the macbook out for airport security and also to pull the laptop out without pulling the whole sleeve out of my larger carry bag . love it . buy it
i bought this case specifically for the pockets i can fit any accessories like usb drives and also my charger in the pockets without having to cramming it into the same pocket as my laptop i have a # . # aluminum unibody macbook with the speck case on and this sleeve fits it perfectly
i also own a xps # . # `` , and it fits perfectly , including all wires and cables it 's a solution to those who already own a confortable regular backpack but do not want to buy a <unk> backpack i am very satisfied
i wanted a snug case for my # `` macbook this one fits perfectly and the pocket holds the power cord/adapter great not as pretty as some of the artsy ones -lrb- <unk> laptop sleeve - notebook carrying case - stripes , <unk> pac <unk> macbook pro <unk> # . # `` -rrb- but it 's nice looking and much cheaper you can carry it alone -lrb- the pocket can hold pens and a small notepad -rrb- or put it in a larger bag the pocket has zippers on both sides , and the zipper on the main compartment goes a few inches down the short sides so you can get the computer out pretty easily even though the sleeve is snug the only negative was that it smelled kind of stinky -lrb- rubber smell -rrb- when i first got it - but it aired out within a few days update : when i use this a lot the red color rubs off on my white macbook it was a little disturbing but it comes off easily you might not have this problem with the other colors
this case -lrb- available in multiple colors -rrb- is a great solution for # . # `` laptops i was able to put a hard case on and still fit snugly into the sleeve the side zipper pockets are nice because all the accessories go in there
very heavy and absolutely only suitable for a strong man to use not suitable for a woman as a carry-on the plane bag has room for a laptop but that is about it too expensive to return as the shipping cost is very hight a suitable <unk> to charity item .
i read all the reviews and decided because of the superior look and feel of the leather i would buy it i travel a lot and if you only use a laptop and a few files , it is fine if you load it up , it will tip over every time and this will get old real quick
nice leather , pretty color holds a good bit , but is cumbersome to get in and out of car i use it when i have more than two files to carry with my i-pad and files , it becomes heavy - much heavier than i expected i suppose it is the wheel mechanism that adds to the weight if i had it to do over , i would not purchase this
it is a good looking bag it has several compartments and holds my computer , ipad , cords , books , pens , etc . however , you will have to hold on to it when you are using the bathroom in a busy airport it does n't stand up on its own it keeps falling forward and you do n't want it to fall on a wet bathroom floor rolls nicely and it seems to hold up okay i would not buy another
first off , this a beautiful leather bag it only has one large compartment for laptop and files not enough for a portable office the other reviews are true ... it is not balanced i have been hit in the face several times by the handle when i bent over to retrieve an item frustrating , because it is a very well made item , just not balanced ... what a bummer
i bought this bag in july # after wearing out a <unk> <unk> bag with over # million airline miles i am happy with the overall quality of the bag which i believe says a lot after owning a <unk> it has a bunch of different sized compartments , the pull handle works easily and is solidly attached , the handle straps are strong and comfortable and it rolls both easy and quiet however , i do not like two features of this bag . # if you plan on putting any normal weight in the pockets that are on the side opposite of the wheels , beware , the bag will want to constantly tip over on its face it likes to tip over the most in airport <unk> and will tip over almost every where else if you do n't prop it up against something or hold on to the pull handle . # this is not an expandable bag and is quite limited to the number of papers , folders , binders that you can carry i am only able to get a stack of paper about # `` tall in it after inserting my # `` laptop and all its accessories
this item was on my daughters wish list at amazon i bought it as a christmas gift i did n't see it until she came home she loves it she said she was very much surprised at the quality of the leather and is able to take it on the plane with her and to the office i would rate it a # star
i 've gone through many laptop cases and this is the best so far ; it 's light , durable and the pocket layout works well i 've had no problem with it tipping over and the exterior is holding up
i love this bag it has helped with my college books it holds a lot of books and supplies it rolls really well and has a shoulder strap when you can not roll it someplace three different ways to transport it where you are going good quality also
amazon as always did a great job getting the item to me i had seen it in a local store for over $ # + on sale when i looked it up online it was only $ # it is absolutely beautiful and the leather is a great quality i needed a briefcase on wheels and it fit the bill i would highly recommend this product and amazon for free shipping !
great case , plenty of room for my computer and a bit of paper work agree with one of the other reviews in that the case is heavy in itself so not the best if you really need to carry it and not roll it
this is a great bag i 've been using this bag daily for over a year now and the leather has held up well i would get it again two call outs - it is heavy so use the wheels - it will tip over easily when full so lean it against another object these have n't been an issue for me once i was aware of them
i just received this today , and am delighted the quality of the leather and the manufacturing are great , with well made seams and quality zips ; the design and detail are fantastic , with many well-thought out pockets i 've been looking for some time now for a rolling laptop bag that is both functional and stylish i think the picture makes the leather look like its poor quality , the photo really does n't do it justice it will look even better once the leather has worn a little i recommend this bag
i love this bag i have used it for years and it still looks great it travels well and works well as a carry-on my only complaint is that it does not come in more colors i would buy another
i bought this item as a gift for my wife , she loved it and thus , so do i . this item is a great price and a great value it is as nice as others at a higher price
our hospital <unk> department bought this as a thank you gift to a beloved <unk> administrator he was moved and we were all impressed by the quality in fact , he would n't use the telescoping handle and wheels because & # # ; he did n't want to get the beautiful leather dirty & # # ; it 's a great item
i have used this <unk> for several years now and it still looks just like new i mean reallly used , as in traveling several days every week , in and out of trunk , plane , offices i pack an incredible amount of paper in it plus my computer all that goes with a traveling office it has been the most useful and professional looking case i have ever used you wo n't go wrong if you purchase
bought one # years ago , my executive husband loved it so much we have now bought a # nd one to replace the well worn first one color looks very rich , nice
i bought this for my wife so she can easily transport her laptop and paperwork to and from work as well as while she is traveling she loves it it is classy looking , nice soft leather and has compartments for paperwork , cords , chargers , etc . it also has a nice padded compartment for the laptop to protect it the wheels roll very smoothly and do not make noise like some others i have heard <unk> through the airport handle collapses easily for overhead storage in the plane my wife said it has taken all the stress off of her neck and shoulders that the typical backpack carriers cause i feel this was an excellent purchase
great bag and great value ordered on a saturday night , and it arrived three days later - standard shipping from e-bags leather is very good quality workmanship is high quality a sharp looking classic bag that rolls as well i like how the handle can be concealed entirely inside the bag as the wheels and plastic protector on the bag are brown like the bag , it almost looks entirely like a carry bag i ordered the tan - which like the other comments , is much darker than the photos it 's more like a medium brown - which i much prefer over the lighter color i would definitely recommend this bag
quality case ... smaller inside than expected , but still enough room have put a # `` laptop , external dvd burner , headphones , glasses , extra battery for the laptop , plus the various cables and charger the inner pocket for the laptop offers good protection i would recommend this case
the product arrived on time and in good condition it is a nice soft leather briefcase with good quality zippers , wheels , handles , shoulder strap and extension handle a great buy for the money includes sleeve for laptop -lrb- would fit # `` fine but not my # `` ; not important to me -rrb- and a little bag for laptop <unk> like power cord lots of pockets and dividers makes this bag a perfect mobile office i use it everyday and it takes it
used to have a carrying case for my work laptop and files bye bye shoulder pain have only had this rolling case for ~ # months so far but no complaints good quality leather , great tan color -lrb- i ordered it in tan but i believe its available in brown and black too -rrb- , good wheels and good sturdy telescoping handle so far so good , holding up beautifully , and very stylish saw the same product for quite a bit more at my local staples store thank you amazon
i bought this bag on-line without being able to get a feel for the actual size and quality it turned out to be perfect for what i needed it great quality and very practical provides tons of extra room and that feel of a high-end item you can find tons of cheaper bags but not of the same quality highly recommend if you willing to pay the price
this is for a newly graduated grandson who recently started a new job he will have a lot of opportunities to use this new briefcase when he meets business clients
the craftsmanship and quality of the leather briefcase is great my husband has had many compliments it has a cushioned middle compartment for a laptop if needed or room for lots of books and supplies for convenience sake it does come with a shoulder strap
this backpack is much taller , wider and heavier than i 'd envisioned from the product description my previous backpack was a similar height but was made of more flexible fabric i 'm a short female , and the backpack was both too tall and too wide on my back since the construction is fairly rigid , it 's very uncomfortable to wear -lrb- it rubs my neck uncomfortably , and also the straps do n't line up properly -rrb- i also found that the lack of outside pockets is really inconvenient the front flap has to be <unk> and completely lifted up to access contents it was awkward to access things like a water bottle or mp # player without setting the bag down to completely <unk> it
the backpack is huge but not a lot of room inside i thought being a # & # # ; backpack , it would be possible to pack a lot of things in the backpack ... wrong ! it looks big but in actuality it is just really long in order to hold the # & # # ; laptop when you wear it , you look like <unk> from <unk>
i bought this back pack to carry my work laptop , ipad , external hd and supplies i need on a typical day on the job i also wanted it as something i could carry when i go to overnight conferences and was hoping it would be all i would need for laptop , ipad , change of clothes , and hygiene kit it does well for my daily routine , but there is no way i am taking it to a conference it holds both my # . # `` screen hp dv # laptop and my first generation dell xps # `` laptop with no problem the xps is a massive laptop so it should hold any laptop you put in it if you are looking at this for a school laptop trust me when i say you will be lucky to fit your laptop , a <unk> book and a notebook i would consider this to be an `` it guy `` laptop if you are looking for an awesome back pack with plenty of storage space check out the upscale ogio metro nylon backpack with laptop pocket i reviewed it too
this backpack seems to be very sturdy and of excellent quality the only problem is that on me , a # ft # in , <unk> woman , it looks completely ridiculous , like a turtle shell i am returning it
i bought this bag because of the security feature of the hidden access i thought it would be really useful for a trip i am taking , in multiple cities it arrived yesterday , and wow , this thing is enormous i am # ' # `` , and there is no way i could comfortably wear it the straps felt too wide on my shoulders , and the bottom of the bag was all the way down to my butt , so it was banging around uncomfortably as i walked it looks cute , and i love the security feature , but its just unusable for someone my size i am sad , but i had to return it i wish they would make a # `` or # `` version of this bag
ok , this thing is huge i have other # inch backpacks i did n't expect this one to be as big as it was and the yellow stripe makes you look like you are a giant <unk> bee wearing this thing i 'm giving it negative starts not for functionality but for looks and size so it really depends what you are looking for i 'm # foot # and this thing looks big on me
i bought this for my hubby 's asus g # . # laptop thinking it would fit with room to spare but that is not the case he just barley gets it to fit in there & zip it up while its a snug fit i didnt return it overall its a nice backpack we like the <unk> feature -lrb- can only be unzipped if its off your back -rrb- & it 's comfy to use for long trips overall i wouldnt buy it again though just because of the snug fit with this specific laptop
we traveled to italy and heard a lot about theft with normal backpacks this secure one made us feel safe knowing people could access any of our stuff
okay , this was larger than i thought it would be , so i 'm having some qualms about bringing this on the plane , since i usually put my bag under the seat in front of me i 'm a short girl , so this bag pretty much <unk> my entire back but i love it nonetheless it 's sturdy , and actually has a lot of space to carry more than the laptop , my wireless mouse , and the adapter i 'm particularly in love with the fact that you can walk around with this bag and not be afraid that someone 's already digging into your things
i think there is no other backpack that can hold a # `` laptop and still has the shape of a `` usual `` backpack unfortunately my asus g # jh does not fit into the designated <unk> , but easily into the center <unk> there is still enough room for my gigantic power adapter , my mouse , spare clothes and other stuff have n't been riding my bike with it yet , but i do n't think i will be disappointed
if you do n't mind a large but secure backpack and do not mind the extra weight , this is for you it is very well constructed and i ca n't see anyway a thief can get into your things nice product though a bit heavy and large
this pack works great for my hp # `` laptop as others have mentioned , the pack is quite large i 'm over six feet tall so that 's not an issue for me , but a smaller person might be bothered by the size it would have been nice if they had included a chest strap , but other than that this is an excellent way to transport your large laptop and accessories
i bought this to use with my motorcycle it 's well made with nice large compartments inside for laptop and other electronic accessories the bag is taller than normal backpacks - i would have liked it to be a bit smaller it lays flat against your back and there is minimal drag it feels very secure against your back
this is a very <unk> bag as other reviewers have said , though , there 's not a lot of room for contents other than a laptop and the power brick and cords i have a laptop with an # . # `` screen , and it fits -- very snugly , but i can close it up there is room for a folder or two , but if you need to carry books and a computer , this is n't the bag you want the bag is extremely secure and there 's even a little pocket for your ipod and a slit for the earphones the straps are wide and very comfortable -- it really feels very light and distributes the weight evenly all in all , a great bag
i actually bought this for a gift it is a very handsome backpack and looks very adult and very european the recipient tells me that he loves it because it is very strong and fits well on his back and <unk> the weight on his back when its contents is heavier he carries it with confidence because it ca n't be opened from the outside
i purchased this item so that i could park a mile away from work and walk to and fro i can carry personal items , homework and my laptop comfortably the balance is wonderful and my back and shoulders feel no strain the streamlined look is very professional and the reflective piping lets cars know i am there i could n't be more pleased
this bag is really high quality stuff the fabric , material and especially protection of the laptop is very well-designed strongly recommended to the people who is seeking for `` secure `` protection for their # `` laptops
i bought this backpack to carry my laptop and a few other items -lrb- folders , pens , portable disk , etc . -rrb- on my commute to work i often ride in on my motorcycle , and i wanted a backpack that would be comfortable , secure and protect my laptop the <unk> is perfect and meets my needs completely it 's not the largest backpack , and once the laptop , miscellaneous items and my dress pants are in it , it 's pretty full but i can fit everything i need and know it 's safe and secure construction is also very high quality , and the waist belt keeps the pack nice and secure at highway speeds i definately recommend the <unk> for anyone looking for a safe , secure , comfortable laptop backpack
i 've really enjoyed this product and it does a great job of protecting my notebooks as well i 've had notebooks ranging from # `` <unk> to # `` macbook pros in this puppy and they all fit snuggly i really like the fact that most of the zippers are secured away when you are wearing the pack ... perfect for those public transportation rides the pack is also very comfortable to wear and sometimes i forget that i even have it on -lrb- when i have smaller notebooks in it of course -rrb- i also get compliments all the time about the pack from people walking around downtown ... which never hurts
i have had many mobile backpacks over the years this backpack takes the cake lots of room well designed spaces for all types of tech the ipod slot on the top is <unk> for the money a great value i highly recommend you purchase this backpack you wo n't be sorry the only downside is the color selection . # choices are poor that is the only minor gripe
now this backpack does make you look like a ninja turtle , but the backpack itself is excellent it 's roomy and easily holds a # `` laptop as long as you have no problem with the aesthetics -lrb- my girlfriend likes it -rrb- , then this is the perfect # `` laptop backpack i 've done a lot of searching , and for the price , this is a great pick up
i looked everywhere for a laptop backpack that woud fit my monster dell inspiron widescreen this pack accomodates with room to spare , and has plenty of space for other items do n't expect to fit a large number of textbooks in here with your pc though , as you will be disappointed however , i routinely carry my laptop , accessories , several folders and a large <unk> press book -lrb- about # `` thick -rrb- without problems i like the removable zipper bags -lrb- it comes with two -rrb- i can only use one of them , however , because it 's pretty difficult to fit both in when a large book is also in the bag overall i am very satisfied with this pack , as the construction quality is <unk> also it is very comfortable to wear
the filling of the handles and the back will make you feel extremely comfortable even when carrying a heavy laptop and a couple of books there is plenty of space inside and a lot of pockets for pens , mp # player , cell phone , etc . its large size will cover your entire back even if you are # ' # `` tall overall is one of the best backpacks that you can find for # inch laptops
i myself have a sony vaio ar series laptop , # `` screen , and had the hardest time finding a backpack style bag that could hold my laptop i had purchased other bags that said they would hold a # `` screen and ended up returning them as they could never close after doing searching online , i found this bag on the manufacturer 's website and finally found it they even provided dimensions of the laptop compartment so i can best determine if this would work i must say , it is a little tight of a fit , but its the best fit i 've found and the bag actually can close without any issues or forcing it i highly recommend this to anyone looking for this particular of bag that are having a hard time finding something to hold a # `` screen , especially a ar series vaio i use this solely for my laptop and accessories , and would be unable to judge its effectiveness for school to carry books with the laptop
i bought this backpack to commute to work the bag had to handle a # & # # ; engineering laptop , a charger , a mouse , a notebook , and a change of clothes this bag is not one you would use for school if you have more than one textbook , this one will not work i 've had other bags that had more capacity , but this one is made for the bike it can sit low on your back and has a hip strap to keep it in place i used mine daily for # hard years , to the point where one of the straps was going to fall off i realized they had a lifetime warranty i simply mailed my old bag to mobile edge two weeks later i had a brand new bag , no questions asked
this a great computer backpack if all you want to carry is your computer and its accessories and maybe a few folders for that i love it however , my # `` gateway # fx will not fit unless i remove the battery i am not really a shut the computer down every time person i like to shut it and run so for me its a small drawback
a lot of thought went into this bag i do like the fact that one of the dividers can be removed to create more space but when that divider is removed many of the great built in pockets are also removed i am a graphic design student and carry a plethora of materials ranging from pens to <unk> i like to have multiple compartments to stow my materials the bag is rather comfortable when it is loaded up with materials i am still adjusting to the limited access of the bag when wearing it
i absolutly love this backpack it 's very easy to use , has plenty of room for all of your stuff very safe , the design of the safety features is first class lot 's of padding to protect your laptop easily fits # `` laptops with room to spare highly recommend to everyone
very happy with this backpack fits my # `` dell laptop and the components that i need only downside is that there 's not a ton of room for other stuff if the laptop is already in it , but that 's somewhat expected as the laptop is big in itself
provides absolutely no cushion , and falls off constantly i ended up giving it to my cat to <unk> on after this i bought the elbow friend pads which are more expensive but work a lot better and stay in place and actually have cushion
it fits my <unk> well , it stays on , and it is sturdy my only complaint is that i had to put in memory foam for more padding i would recommend that case logic add more padding to the sleeve
be aware that they come # in a box the description sounds like there is just one quality is good for the money the case logic logo fabric is in an uncomfortable spot it is either scratching your <unk> or your wrist depending on how you put it on the chair why ca n't they put it under or near an edge
as noted in other reviews , there are two in the package , which is not clear from the description these are not thickly cushioned , but i remedied that by putting some <unk> t-shirts underneath before lacing them up i would like these better if the outer material were something other than neoprene , as it 's not particularly soft on my skin , but it 's acceptable the tags tend to stick up and scratch , so i ended up cutting those off all in all , a decent product for the price
i have an old leather chair and the arm rests have cracked and ripped apart with <unk> this purchase was the <unk> decision i 've made in a while they work perfectly for covering the ripped arm rests not much cushioning , but they do what i wanted them to do
my office chair <unk> were fraying and cracking lacing these up over it did the trick and is now comfortable again the little tag is a little annoying , but it 's a minor gripe
i like a little more padding so i added hand towels before lacing the sleeve nice to look at i also would have liked the tag on the side but not a dealbreaker
bought these for my office chair which had worn arms and you could feel the bolts . it was easy to attach and works great i only wish there was a bit more padding or memory foam in the part your elbow rests on . then i would have given it #
i really like these they feel great , protect the chair and look great i have an <unk> chair and they fit perfectly very easy to install put the over the <unk> , position as you want , and pull on the laces until they are snug on both ends requires a bit of a tug used a double knot , and they stay in place perfectly
used as a cover for the arm rest on a wheel chair to <unk> where the vinyl was cracking and scratching my grandson 's <unk> material is easy to clean with a damp cloth
