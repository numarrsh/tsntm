i did n't mind the pattern on the sleeve because the price was right i bought it for my viewsonic g tablet and it was a snug fit which i like there is no danger of my tablet rocking about in the sleeve and the sleeve lies flat when not in use also , it is slim enough to fit into my purse very nicely
i bought this as a christmas gift for a teenage girl and i think she is going to love it i picked a <unk> polka dot pattern to match a turquoise netbook i just tried it on my little toshiba nb # netbook and it fits nice and snug -lrb- fabric has some stretch -rrb- it does n't feel like its flopping around inside the cover seems very well constructed with very nicely sewn seams not sure if built ever looks at these reviews but the only change i would have made if i made this myself would be to sew a handle to the bottom opposite the zipper you could use it to slide the case off the laptop and also to carry it this is a really cute cover
the product was defective - the zipper was missing a few teeth meaning it could not be zipped all the way it was on a corner and not immediately evident so the the seller may not have known of it prior to shipping the seller accepted the return very <unk> and refunded the full purchase price very quickly we had to cover return postage but it was only a few dollars
such a pretty , fun , and creative laptop cover i 've gotten lots of compliments -lrb- and its much more affordable with amazon than at <unk> -rrb- goes great with the smaller pouch to store batteries , projector connectors , etc .
this sleeve has a nice thickness to it and should offer good protection its for my daughter who is a college student the zipper opens very wide and should not scratch the computer which is a # inch mac airbook great purchase for a good price cute pattern too
really nice laptop sleeve the material is great and the shape really original and <unk> also the size is perfect for a mac book pro # `` the ship was really good and without
perfect sleeve ! i have always purchased built products for my previous laptops i had purchased this sleeve under the impression that it may not be slim , it turns out to be it is ! and it is perfect for my macbook air # . # inch laptop great <unk> sleeve
ordered for a lenovo x # , most sleeves were either too small or too loose but this seems to accomodate a # inch laptop just about right plus the funky colors look
i have several other built ny products they are well made , innovative , and well designed this sleeve fits my # & # # ; macbook pro unibody like a glove i do not have the thinner retina display model , either i have the last model made with an optical drive the sleeve is great to carry my laptop to school and protect it from scratches while giving it a bit of cushion i also have the digital camera <unk> in this same pattern as well as another sleeve for a # & # # ; wide screen beast of a laptop i also own they make good products and they are worth the extra money over some of the bargain sleeves it is just snug enough to protect the laptop and just loose enough to allow the laptop to by inserted or pulled out with ease
this laptop has a very attractive looking it is good for a girl to carry her netbook daily the quality is excellent the only thing bothered me is that it is not big enough to put my # `` gateway netbook in i have to try very hard to squeeze it in and stretch the bag to zip it on i am worried it might be broken after certain amount of zipping on and off so be careful if you want to use it for your # `` netbook
this sweet little laptop bag is absolutely perfect for my # `` laptop i can wear it as a messenger bag or hold it by it 's handle it 's amazingly cute and it is n't filled with useless ` extras ' . it does exactly what it 's supposed to
it 's obviously very beautiful , and the size is just perfect the only thing that i complained is for the two inside pockets that only are capable to handle the cable and a little mouse but it 's perfect to carry my # inch laptop
pure <unk> ! this laptop portfolio is perfect for any netbook i 've gotten plenty of compliments -lrb- and many looks of envy -rrb- two compartments to fit your charging cords and mouse plus , the colors are great
i bought this bag for a # `` netbook i love it it has two pockets inside for the accessories and the netbook fits like a glove i wanted something fun and lightweight and this is perfect
a great cover for the netbook has two pockets on the inside to store the cord the strap length is adjustable for comfort the perfect size for on the go work
we bought two of the for our planet box <unk> lunch boxes the lunch boxes slide right in and the strap makes them very easy to transport great price , too
i bought this bag for my # inch hp # nr netbook with a # cell battery i love this bag my hp fits perfectly and there are two compartments inside that can hold the power cord and even an external drive or mouse there is even still enough room for something else for example , a book or notebook this bag is also very colorful and beautiful i highly recommend this item
basically this little bag turned out to be exactly what i bought it for - a sleeve with a strap for hauling my ipad to the gym the ipad fits in sideways and there 's about another inch and a half at the -lrb- longer -rrb- end of it - for a spare <unk> or pair of gloves or something of course , you could also put your keys in there , but then you 'd be risking scratching the screen of your ` pad there are also two interior pockets that 'll make a much better <unk> for keys the whole inside is a soft fabric that 's very <unk> the entire bag is quite sturdy and well made it 's neoprene , a spongy `` wetsuit `` fabric it 's got a nice long strap and you * can * zip the zipper with the ipad inside the price on this was amazing - around $ # it may not be the best deal i 'll get this year , but it 's probably the best one i 'll get this month . ;
charming and useful , this laptop portfolio is a must buy resistant material , but i wish i had known it was not as large on its side as the portfolio case dot pattern -lrb- -lsb- ... -rsb- -rrb- the good thing is that i bought it for my # . # inch notebook , so i have space for it and other stuff i need together
i had a similar built carrier for my netbook , but since i upgraded to a # `` laptop i needed a new case this one works great for it , and includes an outside pocket for cords and mouse i can throw my stuff in it and go there 's enough room for papers and other whatnot too
i bought this bag based on several positive reviews and after seeing a friend of mine carrying one i 've been looking for a long time for a lightweight , protective , minimal and nice-looking computer bag and am really pleased with the built i have a macbook pro # . # `` and it fits perfectly into the # . # size bag the front pocket makes it easy to tote an adapter , accessories and files i carry it along with a regular work bag or purse if you are looking for a minimal , comfortable computer carrier , this is a great bag one wish : an inside zip pocket so that i could stow usb drives and other small items
just purchased a new macbook pro with retina display this case fits perfectly it is very well made and the zipper seems to be very strong hopefully it will last a long time for the money that i paid overall highly recommened
i own # of these , one for my macbook air and one for my new macbook pro it 's great protection for the product it 's a great product that i can throw in any bag i own , it does n't have to specifically be a computer bag i also like that there is protection between the zipper and the computer , i 've tried others that just zip directly around the computer and scratches the computer i would definitely buy another one of these if i had another mb
i bought this after the bad experiences i had with my last macbook pro and the incase sleeve at first i was a bit <unk> as to get this or leave without a case because the sleeve i had before would always scratch the edges when closing the zipper it would take a lot of patience and time to close the zipper without scratching it and thought this hard case might be plagued with the same design problems boy i was wrong not only it fits snug despite other claims but i can close the zipper without worrying about scratching my laptop i trust this case and would recommend it to any macbook pro # `` user
the booq vyper m # does just as it advertises , providing ample protection for your mbp i bought it specifically to put in a backpack because i feared without a case it would eventually endure some cosmetic damage from carrying it around i 'm proud to say that i 've made it through a semester of college without a scratch on my computer 's aluminum body the case is quite the `` tank `` as some of my friends call it the only thing to watch out for is to always carefully zip/unzip the case if you 're not careful , the zipper may slide over your computer , possibly leaving it with a scratch do n't worry though , this problem never affected me as i 'm sure the majority of mbp owners care about their computer 's condition i recommend this to any college student who carries their computer around campus
a really good messenger bag for the creative professional , at a very good price the appearance , construction and materials are excellent my # macbook pro fits inside , although a little hard to take it off my only complain for not giving # stars is the <unk> access to the bag 's inside i understand the `` safe `` system to protect the equipment , but it 's impossible to take anything from the bag without sitting down and take the time to unfold it the rain cover is a clever and original plus
this is a great case i have used the handy rain cover and it works well the compartments and dividers are very useful i used it with my macbook pro # & # # ; and it fits nicely until i put a speck cover on my macbook
i have just got one of these <unk> laptop bags and i definitely loved it at first sight it is much bigger than i 've thought and has a lot of surprises in details the material quality is in high level compared to its price however it is a bit heavy i guess this is because of the leather exterior so it is ok for me i am planing to use it in my daily <unk> ; business , trip , academic , etc . quick shipping was also a plus for this seller -lrb- <unk> -rrb- in short , if you want a functional bag which is stylish and fashionable at the same time , then it is the right choice for you
i was looking for a laptop bag that was stylish , easy to carry and came across this bag i like the style , the quality and price this was designed by <unk> after all , it is for technical people in mind i also recommend the seller `` value on style `` excellent customer service i had a question and they quickly addressed it
lets face it , if you travel often with your laptop you know how much of a hassle it can be to find a bag that serves multi purposes , but still keeps your laptop safe and secure this bag is one of a new generation of carryon bags that allows you to unzip the middle , fold it flat , and pass it through airport security with little to no hassle case logic usually makes quality products with solid designs , and this case is no different it looks sharp , and has quality pieces i have already gotten a few compliments and `` where did you get that ? `` types of questions the only downside i have found is that i like pockets for things and quite frankly , this case does n't have near the amount of storage i need maybe for the average person who does n't need more than # extra pouches this will work just fine plus , there is also no dedicated mp # hole coming through the case being that this is pretty much a first generation case i am hopeful that those issue will be corrected in the future , but for now i can only give this one four stars
this <unk> inch case logic briefcase is billed as `` security friendly , `` meaning that when you go through airport security with your laptop , the `` dedicated laptop compartment protects your laptop throughout the screening process . the case is cushioned to keep your computer from being damaged if it is accidentally jostled there are handy compartments and organizers for storing gadgets and other accessories , a comfortable and adjustable shoulder strap , and padded handles this item is exceptionally attractive and well-made it would make a great gift for the busy business traveler or college student who is constantly on the go even if you never go near an airport , this is a useful item
i bought this laptop case because i was tired of the airport hassle with my laptop i made my first trip with this case recently and it went through security with ease the case also fits well on the plane and has enough room to carry a few extra items overall i am well pleased with it and would buy it again
i get compliments on this all the time it fits my macbook pro perfectly , with room for the charger and a couple of notebooks the cushioned strap is nice , too holding up well , too
this is a great bag it was exactly what i expected based on the description or maybe even better very nice use of space so many pockets to keep everything organized very comfortable to carry i highly recommend it the charcoal gray color with pop of green keeps it sophisticated and fun
- the bag is horizontal , so items you put in does n't end up <unk> one on top of the other like in a regular backpack - roomy , with enough little pockets for your <unk> - of course , can <unk> from backpack to shoulder bag - when used in backpack mode , does n't make your back sweat - only a little padding on the straps - if worn for a long time , you will get aching shoulders , just like with a standard <unk> if you 're looking to carry a backpack for a long time , get one with a <unk> so you can carry the bag on your waist - on mine , the <unk> broke after only about a month 's use
good bag ; very utilitarian could be more durable and waterproof also , the size of the clasps on front are a little too small difficult to open and close in a hurry overall , it looks great and is very comfortable with two straps
this bag is designed to haul books and up to a # inch laptop either as a backpack or a messenger bag i use this on my motorcycle to carry well everything from groceries to a trip to <unk> it can hold a couple bags of groceries or # <unk> <unk> and chips and <unk> for four people i have even made trips to costco and put two bags of <unk> <unk> or # wine bottles or two # lb bags of ice while riding a motorcycle even a trip to in & out <unk> or <unk> it can hold enough food for # people easily on a motorcycle i wear it as a backpack on my motorcycle and when sitting on the motorcycle the bag actually sits right on the seat behind you while you ride so all the weight is on the seat and not on you i have even been able to where this and a <unk> <unk> # backpack at the <unk> on a long trips when i need to carry a bunch of extra
love everything about this bag great for all my needs very roomy for my computer and books , love the color easy transaction fast delivery bbp bags - hybrid <unk> medium
this item is too big for my asus # `` screen the # `` screen is physically smaller than the # `` screen and the mfg of the case said it would work well with the # or # `` it does n't the case it too big for the body of the computer to fit into the corner tie downs and does n't work like i expected it to work
i bought this case for the acer # `` netbook when you put the computer <unk> in the case you think you are going to break the zippers to get it closed as tight as it is i do n't think the case 's zipper will last very long my wife said she would find something else to use it for i am just using my brief case to carry it around till i find a case that fits the netbook
this was a recommendation on the amazon site as a case that would fit the # inch acer aspire it 's way too tight quality seems fine though returning the item isnt easy # % restocking fee ... pay for your own shipping
i recently purchased this bag to accommodate my new acer aspire one when i first received the bag i was pleased after i purchased accessories it was no longer pleasing i have to purchase a different bag in order to hold everything i need to make my computer the ideal purchase i guess the slim fit pouch will be put in the closet what a waste of money
this barely holds my # . # inch acer every time i zip it closed i 'm waiting for the tearing sound that i know will eventually come and i ca n't return it because i ordered it with my acer and that got delayed for more than # days so i 'm stuck with this the pocket for the charger is what sold me but again , it barely fits in there forget holding anything else
the only way i was able to zip up the aspire one and its components was to remove the battery i then put the battery and charger cords in the outer pocket it was an extremely tight fit i could not get the bag to zip with the battery on the aspire one the travel mouse would not fit i had my husband try and he had the same results i purchased this bag since it was <unk> with the acer aspire one aod # # . # -inch netbook - sapphire blue item the bag is advertised to fit the netbook that is misleading the bag itself does not disappoint me , however it should not be advertised for the # . # acer aspire one
just bought the acer aspire # inch and added this memory foam case with my initial purchse it 's a nice case ; although it is supposed to fit the # inch acer one with the # cell battery it 's a tight fit and difficult to zip up i have to be careful to not scratch the case when trying to zip close the case if you plan to purchse this case , plan on attempting to stretch the case for a more comfortable fit
ok after debating for a while whether i should actually get a sleeve for such a small netbook or just carry it around in my gigantic purse , i finally decided to buy a sleeve since i decided to buy one , i wanted something worth my money and would protect my netbook what caught my attention about this one is the extra pocket -lrb- actually fits my charger and mouse -rrb- and the memory foam i had it for a couple of weeks so far and i love it it fits my acer nicely mine is not tight at all another plus for me is that it fits in my purse so i can either carry it by the handle or carry it in my purse
when i purchased the acer aspire one aod # # . # -inch netbook i found this case advertised as designed for that netbook i took a chance as i read several reviews for this case and other cases , with varying degrees of satisfaction this looked to be the best choice i am very pleased with the case , the fit , and the quality price was nice , as well
i read the previous reviews and were afraid of my acer aspire one # . # not fitting when i received it , i tried it right away . it fits perfectly ! ! if you are considering this case for the # . # , you should definetely buy it
when i was looking for a netbook case , the main feature i was looking for was a protection finally i got this bag and have been using it for a while i can say this is one sturdy protective case the interior memory foam provides a custom-fit protection for my netbook even the inside of the front case is made of a memory foam if you are looking for a protection for your netbook , you ca n't go wrong with this one oh , and about size issues . i do n't find any difficulty at all putting in my netbook and so i do n't think you will have a problem with it
i purchased this case from another vendor in <unk> the construction on mine is poor i use it only to carry from the house to my <unk> car and then into work , perhaps twice a week after merely # months , the material is already pulling away from the seam on the laptop side there is not much room for anything other than the laptop , it 's power unit and cords , and a notebook mouse the pictures on amazon are deceiving because the laptop side does not open all the way ; there is an expander that only allows it open about eight inches or so so inserting or removing the laptop is a pain in the rear i would n't recommend this to anyone
i purchased this breifcase for my husbands notebook but it would n't fit . i 'm not <unk> it because of that fact though since i would of just used it with one of our grandsons laptops instead except that the quality , lack of protective padding and the <unk> of storage space caused me to return it it might be ok for a sub $ # . # notebook but since all of ours cost much more than that i 'm forced to keep looking for a top quality , well padded carrying case
i recently purchased this item because of my hp hdx # t laptop , and although its a good product , i had to replace it with a backpack -lrb- also from caselogic -rrb- there 's nothing really wrong with this case -- its sturdy and is built well ; my laptop fits well inside , it with a little more room to spare for accessories and stuff but the hdx # -lrb- as well as its accessories -rrb- is a heavy mother and it hurts my neck and shoulder if i carry it for more than ten minutes but the backpack <unk> the weight much more efficiently so unless you have a lightweight # `` or # `` laptop with little accessories to carry around i 'd say go for it has clean lines and looks nice and `` appropriate `` if your wearing a business suit , but ... you get the picture
this is a pretty typical and generic laptop case not to be <unk> from # s of others the only minor nit i had was that it felt a little flimsy to me and the padding didnt feel as cushy or protective as some other cases i have used in the past i would say that if you get a great deal on it then its worth purchasing as a utility item otherwise there are probably better alternatives
the bag is ok to carry the toshiba # . # `` screen laptop ... but not much else the computer barely fits , and the next big thing is trying to fit the power adapter in also i got a mouse and a few wires in the front pouch if i had it to do over , i 'd find another bag , -lrb- but no one carries them in stores , so you got ta buy a <unk> in a poke ! ! -rrb- amazon always has best price and delivery
this case easily accomodates my hp dv # t which has a # . # `` display the padding is a bit light but it makes the case lighter than another i have for my office computer the <unk> strap in the laptop section is off-center i use the velcro edge insert turned # degrees to hold down the other side there are enough pockets for power supply , mouse , and pad and a small one to put your cellphone if you want to
i received this nice laptop bag from caselogic about a month ago and have been using it since i have an acer aspire # laptop and wanted to protect it from everyday use and my children the laptop its nice and secure in the bag , even though the laptop is heavy it stays nice and tight my only wish is that it had a little bit more padding but size counts too so its a give and take i like the quick open flap that can hold extras like phone , memory cards , etc . the shoulder strap works nice and is comfortable for short times the color is professional looking , not all bright and flashy like some of them are all in all i would for sure recommend this laptop bag specially for its price and value
the `` caselogic tnc- # -inch laptop briefcase `` holds everything i need -lrb- with some room to spare -rrb- , especially when i 'm traveling for business this is not a small item - it 's a big case for large laptops , and considering it 's size and bulk , it is a very well designed carrying case i especially like that everything has it 's own place you can secure your laptop snuggly whether it 's a full # -inches or much smaller and there is plenty of room for notebooks , software , pens - your mobile and any number of other items and gadgets you need to carry
this case is constructed well and will do a good job of protecting my # `` toshiba there are two things i would change about the case it needs to have more room for accessories the front zipper does not unzip the whole way around the case this makes getting the laptop in and out a little awkward overall a good case for the money
this is a great basic laptop bag it does not have a lot of extra room for other papers , but there is pleanty of room for a laptop , power cord and a few small accessories the front pocket has zero depth , so it is really limited to a pen and a pad of post-its if you only need to travel with your laptop and a few small accessories , this is for you if you want to also cary a few files , this is n't for you since i only just received the bag , i can not comment on durability , but it seems pretty well made the velcro on the interior flaps -lrb- that hold the laptop in place -rrb- seem to be of fairly high quality , although i 'm sure they will degrade over time the zipers all seem high quality
this is exactly the right size for my laptop and this was the only one i could find that was actually in stock just about perfect because other than the fact that it does n't have a lot of extra space , it did the job just nicely just enough room for a mouse , and power connector not much else easy to carry , has a shoulder strap and regular handle and good padding inside highly recommend if you 're having a hard time finding a case that can handle an # inch laptop
there are very few choices for those with an # . # `` laptop so i was concerned that it may not be very good this case is excellent i have had it for over a year and it is still in great condition it will last longer than my laptop
i was extremely satisfied when i received this item i had recently gotten a laptop but not a bag and my brother suggested this bag and it works excellently it fits my laptop and my charger and even has extra room for if i wanted to carry a notebook or something along with my laptop overall it is great
i ordered this for my brother he was having trouble locating an # `` laptop bag this bag fits everything perfectly and keeps the laptop well protected he uses this for work everyday and likes the fact that it keeps everything in place a must have for laptop users
cases for this size laptop are hard to find in stores this was exactly what i needed for an # . # `` laptop good quality case and fits perfectly without adding extra bulk and yet enough room to store accessories as well
had a hard time finding a quality case to fit this very large lap top pleased to find this one and making sure it would fit was easy recieved right on time as promised <unk> round great experience
i had been looking for a case for my # `` laptop for quite some time this was one of only three that i was able to find online ; they were no place to be found in stores i originally ordered from dell before christmas only to be notified # weeks later that it was out of stock i was able to find it on amazon , ordered on monday morning and received it tuesday afternoon ! ! it is a nice looking case that does not look like a suitcase
good protection for a laptop this big has minimal storage but with laptop this size you do not want to carry much more will hold power brick , cords , mouse , folders and pens if storage is a must go for a laptop backpack there are several nice ones for the large laptops i do wish there were <unk> or feet on the bottom to keep bag off the floor
recently ordered the caselogic tnc- # really like the laptop case for my # inch laptop could not beat the price of $ # . # from <unk> which included shipping got the case in less than a week excellent ! !
i love it bought it for a trip to new york city and it worked out perfect my laptop is longer then most and it was great so glad i got it also , able to store magazines , papers etc lots of room
i was greatly satisfied with the briefcase it is of excellent quality and more than i expected it is n't bulky , is easy to carry and adjustable it was the only one i could find that would accommodate my laptop without spending alot great deal for the price caselogic tnc- # -inch laptop briefcase -lrb- black
i was pretty excited when i first got this bag , but about a year in it developed problems first , the grippy rubber coating on the shoulder strap peeled off as a result , it wo n't stay put on your shoulder second , the zipper to the laptop compartment broke now every time it rains or <unk> i worry that my laptop is getting wet it 's a nice bag at first , but it wo n't last
have two <unk> , a much larger one for $ # , and this one for the past # months almost like it the best these guys make quality , thoughtful products for the $ # bucks , what you get is off the charts a great bag for my # `` macbook pro , plus cords , air cards , folders , and a magazine or two a great bag
this is my second brenthaven bag the first one was <unk> by my cat who used it as a litter box while i was on vacation i had it for a year and it was still like new , before the cat did its business like the first one , this one is very well made and able to take the abuse i deliver similar bags in stores cost at east # bucks -lrb- i know because i shopped around for a while -rrb- this one is priced like a cheapo targus bag you 'd find at staples but feels like a tumi tech
i should have listened to one of the reviews before i ordered this bag it looks different than the picture and it is not an inland bag it is a <unk> , which is part of the inland brand it is a nice bag , but not what i was expecting to get
i ordered this for my # inch laptop on a recent air trip , the flap got bent up just by carrying it by the handle it no longer lays flat
it is made of good quality , looks good , and my # & # # ; laptop fits inside perfectly has some convenient compartments too i have n't seen a bag that was better for the same price
have a new # . # `` dell inspiron that fits comfortably in this bag it 's top loading where computer goes two slots in top , one for computer and the other i use for legal size files also , a large mesh pocket in back and a large zippered compartment on the front for mouse and other accessories so far seems like a a good value for the price
this product exceeded my expectations for the price the material is very strong , and there is plenty of extra cushion , ensuring the safety of my laptop the bag itself is a little bit larger than i imagined , but that just leaves plenty of room for my school books there are also plenty of pockets of various sizes
this briefcase is big i could fit a # & # # ; + a # & # # ; laptop in it + all their cables , # mice , some other cables and a handful of documents it is huge i had a hard time adjusting to it 's size and for the first few days i kept banging it 's side into things the one thing that i do not like is the cheap finish it has to it do n't get me wrong , the materials are ok and they do the job but touching it reminds you of the cheapness of the whole thing
i love this case i bought it for my # & # # ; hp envy laptop and it works great i can fit everything in there , even my cooler master ultra slim cooling pad , mouse , etc . and still take it on a plane , -lrb- though your laptop bag is going to be more like a brief case , but it will still fit under the seat for landing and take off . construction is sturdy and there 's alot of nifty pouches and such inside for whatever it 's nicely cushioned so i feel safe sticking my $ # pc in there all in all <unk> one of the best carrying cases i could have got the previous high star reviews were correct . -
i was looking for a bag for my # . # inch laptop , but most of the ones i found in stores were $ # or more this bag is strudy , cushioned inside , has plenty of pockets and storage -- and fits my laptop with room to spare there is so much room inside -lrb- and an inside padded panel -rrb- you could even fit another laptop inside if you have a smaller laptop , there 's a velcro panel you can used to adjust the inside pocket size i was n't expecting much because the price was so good , but i am really happy with this bag i usually only buy things online when i know the product and am sure of what i 'll be receiving i 'm glad i took a chance on this bag it has exceeded my expectations
this was perfect for my # . # dell notebook it 's big , with enough pockets for the charger and all the other accessories i highly recommend this case for anyone with a large notebook
l <unk> at this price it would be adequate but wow , it is very nice plenty of padding , extra pockets , and easy openings plenty of room for my # . # `` laptop plus my external # tb drive with all necessary cables and room left over this is a <unk> buy it now
great value for the money the shoulder strap is a nice bonus lightweight , but sturdy enough to carry my computer safely during travels order was processed quickly and my case was delivered in record time very pleased with the ordering process and the item ordered
we bought this for a road trip it is a great case fit the computer well a little heavy , but not horrible -lrb- granted with a # . # inch computer , it is heavy anyway -rrb- served its purpose well hard to find this size at a great price like we did on this one
for the price , right around $ # , i was very impressed with the quality of this bag it comfortably fits a # . # & # # ; laptop safely and securely it has lots of pockets to store the charger , mouse , external hard drive and other peripherals would highly recommend
i purchased this bag and it is roomy and light i just used it for travel it is roomy enough to carry work stuff , chargers and space on the out side for easy access to phone , boarding pass and id i also purchased and used the cooling pad and i expected a noisy thing but it is very quiet and light this is one of the best combinations happy customer here ! btw thank you others for helping me make a decision i read reviews before any purchase
this bad was big enough to hold my # . # computer the nice thing is there are tons of pockets so you can put other stuff besides just the computer and power source in it the padding around the computer is decent , nothing tooo amazing , but good enough to protect it from a nick or a somewhat hard drop
very pleased with this inland notebook briefcase # -rrb- very sturdy , yet lightweight to carry the material is not leather but it is weather resistant # -rrb- lots of pockets , dividers and great padding # -rrb- sturdy fixed strap with heavy duty and wide shoulder pad -- and strap is adjustable # -rrb- easy open close flap with snap a great buy
third time was the charm after buying two other cases in an attempt to protect my new laptop the other two claimed they would fit i even checked the measurements but when they arrived i found that there was no way they would fit - large and in charge with more than enough room for my # . # <unk> amount of <unk> of pockets -lrb- but not too many - two secure straps -lrb- hand and shoulder ones - seems like great , durable <unk> <unk> in less than # hours
i love this bag it held my laptop , my tablet , my # phones , all my files and the chargers , and everything was at hand with all it compartment this was a great buy i would recommend this bag
this is very hard to find a bag for a # inch pc as that is not the most popular one this case exceeded my <unk> <unk> in every way
as the price was less than $ # i expected far less than arrived i am delighted there are ample storage features for files , mouse , charge cords , pen , etc . my # & # # ; dell fits in very comfortably and there is lots of protective padding a # & # # ; laptop is heavy and needs a sturdy case this is that case the only surprising thing about the briefcase is the price
not too bulky good looking case inexpensive -lrb- did i say that ? i ca n't see buying anything else when this is an option buy it , now
this is a very nice laptop bag it has ample room for large notebook , mouse , <unk> and many other items it has nice padding for the price and is just what i had hoped it would be for <unk> on the go very satisfied with this product comfortable shoulder strap adjusts
the product is really amazing , good quality , light , thin , but there is one big problem , did n't fit my macbook air to close the case with the macbook air inside is really terrible , because did n't fit , you must push hard the macbook air inside to close the case
this is a false advertising . it does not fit the macbook # inch i really tried stuffing my laptop in there but it would not work . very disappointed that they would label it so . this is a total return
while my macbook pro does fit , i can barely zip the case closed my laptop has scratches on the corner from the zipper if only it was a few millimeters bigger it would be perfect
basically i received it in the mail today but it did n't have the hooks attached to connect a strap to it , and also theres a label in the front not <unk> plain black and gray with <unk> i was kinda disappointed , especially how there were no hooks on the one i received like in the picture
this case looks and sounds great , but it does not fit the macbook pro # model -lrb- which should be the same size as previous pro 's -rrb- this may fit the macbook air , but when trying to zipper the # `` pro into this pouch , it just does n't fit at all it may be possible to squeeze it , but the zippers would definitely scratch the aluminum surface
