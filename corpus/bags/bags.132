for a # `` laptop be carefull the pics . <unk> a smaller laptop with a larger # `` laptop , there is no room in the body of the case to store the power brick charger just received case and trying to decide what to do with the power <unk> brick concerned if i place it on top of computer , case may bulge for that matter wherever i stick the power supply , the case may bulge taking another look at the leather targus to see if it will provide more space for power supply and will return this one
it would be a # -star plus but i do not like the dome protection i think it does just the opposite and puts pressure at the center of the laptop instead of <unk> it around evenly it adds weight and bulk to the bag i wish i could take it out i 'm actually considering returning the bag if i can find one without the dome protection
bag feels comfortable on shoulder , and has a lot of compartments for miscellaneous papers , cables , cds , external drives , etc . figuring out where to store these various items is a personal choice , but there are a lot of options , which i really like i have # `` macbook pro and the storage compartment seems too big for it i may have ordered the wrong size but it 's really big , which means the laptop is n't snug when strapped in that 's really my only concern about the bag
i bought this case about a year or two ago guess my review never went through when i bought this product , i was expecting the double-sided deluxe case , which was in the image shown upon receiving the case , it was only <unk> i contacted the seller and he explained some products did n't get shipped with the right order so he refunded my money and let me keep the case i thought this was an excellent move and i recommend the seller in the future i also recommend this case for laptops i found this to be the best laptop case out there it 's highly durable and the strap and handle are very comfortable
targus computer bag seems great if it is as good as the targus it is replacing i will be very happy my old one has made it # years with weekly travel with no problems
bought this bag approximately a month ago it is a good basic bag protects my laptop well it is not as roomy as my old dell bag , but did n't cost as much either
this case fits my dell # . # inch laptop just fine there are pockets in the front that can hold some paperwork and my wireless mouse the straps seem to be sturdy enough to hold the weight i have had it a few weeks now and it has worked great i hope it holds up
this is a great bag for the money it 's roomy and has plenty of space for my # inch laptop there is a little zippered case for the power cord , which fits next to the laptop while in the bag the bag is sturdy and functional and i definitely recommend it
looked all over for a case that would fit my # & # # ; laptop , but price and <unk> were crazy i found this highly recommend on other <unk> and was glad to find the best price and great shipping on amazon keep up the great work
i was looking for a laptop bag as a birthday gift for my brother he wanted , and needed a bag large enough for his new # . # `` screen computer , and durable enough for travel after shopping around , and pricing the same targus brand laptop bag in stores i decided to try on the web , and i 'm extremely excited and happy i did i got the exact same bag on amazon for almost half of what they wanted at the store this laptop bag fit the bill perfectly , and the price was right i would highly recommend this bag to anyone who 's looking for a great product at a more than fair price plus it arrived right on time for gift wrapping for his birthday
i have a sony # `` laptop computer and with this case it has plenty of room the people with a # `` laptop will love this i also like the protection on the side of the case along with the dome protection amazon helped me find the best price i am well satisfied with the case and price
this is my second one of these so i speak from experience had the first one -lrb- only minor changes to latest model -rrb- for # years of hard use and abuse only problem was that one of the zipper pull handles broke and i just used a small key ring as a substitute replaced my other one because it was getting too beat up -lrb- all me ! -rrb- to take to a client presentation absolutely great product
this case is so well made and durable for a # inch laptop the number of pockets for storage are numerous and great it 's so convenient to use with zipping completely open and the dome gives added protection the separate zipped pouch is the right size for the power cord and the pocket for the mouse is convenient this case is a good value for the price we are very pleased with the purchase which was a gift for my husband
this is a very convenient bag and perfect for flying light and sturdy it <unk> quickly for airport checks and fits under airline seats ample storage for programs , mice , power supply and accessories
i got this case for my new hp # & # # ; laptop my order came quickly and the case was as described my laptop fit nicely inside with plenty of pouches , etc . for all my needs it is well made and should last a long time
this bag has lots of storage on the outside , which is very nice one thing that i like is all of the little areas a textbook and notebook can be easily stored in the back lots of pocket space in the front for whatever you need i have a toshiba # inch laptop , it fills the space nicely with little room to spare as far as the power cords go , i <unk> put them in the accessory pouch that comes with the bag plenty of room for storage of a mouse can not beat the price , purchased from amazon for over $ # . # difference in price , compared to a local store would highly recommend to anyone
i 've been using this bag for about a year now it 's come with me to school , work , and on several plane rides , both domestic and international , and i can honestly say i love this thing it 's been dropped , tripped over , rained on , been through very hot and cold days , and generally <unk> pretty severely it 's not only survived but protected my laptop -lrb- both the # `` i had originally and the # `` i use now -rrb- and all the other things i 've stored in here it 's an extremely reliable everyday bag with space for pretty much anything you might need in addition to your laptop -lrb- such as folders , pens and <unk> , etc -rrb- in addition , amazon 's price is around $ # cheaper than what i paid in store , so this is a great deal , too i ca n't recommend this bag highly enough , it 's one of the best i 've ever had
love this case i bought it to carry my gaming laptop its a # . # in screen and bulky , and the laptop fits perfectly plenty of pockets to store mouse and other accessories
being an it pro i carry alot of extras with me to clients my old bag was small and i could n't keep some small tools in it i have a # `` laptop and it fits like a glove there is enough pockets and compartments to keep the small extras you may need things like the power brick , a few ethernet cables dvd -lrb- has a pocket just for them for easy access -rrb- small screwdriver set , and a # port switch it also has pockets to keep important client papers with you i would highly recommend this bag
purchased as a gift for recipient with an over sized laptop i had to return the standard laptop bag because it was too small but this is perfect recipient is very
i carry my computer and other materials in this case as i travel all over the world i actually bought this exact case about # years ago and it has been with me on hundreds of plane rides all over the us , europe , and china the case has held up remarkably well but , after opening and closing the zippers thousands of times , the zippers are finally wearing out and will not stay closed other than that , the case is still in great shape so i purchased the same case again i have owned many other hard and soft cases by several manufacturers and this is easily the best carry case i 've owned
i 'm very delighted with the capacity , quality and utility of the targus bag i have a sony vaio # laptop and everything i need fits perfectly the padding is durable and lightweight with special protection that other bags did n't provide the bag is even better <unk> than i expected i highly recommend this unit
this bag is just perfect i have an asus rog laptop # . # + # inches in the back are for the fans , so the laptop is huge and bulky but it fits this case perfectly and it protect it really well
i 've been looking for a laptop case for my new # . # inch screen hp hdx- # laptop and the targus cpt # dus is a perfect match there are no laptop case for laptops that are over # inch screen size the nice looking cpt # dus case is well designed and constructed with quality material the dome protection feature gives me added comfort knowing my laptop will have more protection from those accidental drop the case situations the handle and shoulder straps are sturdy yet comfortable all the storage pockets are well laid out and there are plenty of them so i can easily organize my travel items although the targus cpt # was meant for # inch size laptops , my hp hdx- # fits perfectly in the case the power supply for the hdx- # laptop has to be stored in the front pocket but it fits perfectly , still leaving room for other important travel items overall , the targus cpt # dus is an excellent choice for a laptop case and <unk> 's price is just unbeatable
my mom & dad bought this bag for my birthday from amazon and i read everyone 's reviews and did all my research beforehand thank you everyone for describing in detail in your reviews , as to what you had purchased and what features the bag had that were not listed i most likely would not have made the decision for this bag if it had not been for those detailed reviews but when i got it for my birthday , i really really liked it and found plenty of pockets that i still did n't even know where there on the bag and there 's also a lifetime warranty that comes with it i 'm super satisfied with my choice
i spent considerable time trying to find a case that could accommodate our # inch laptop this targus case did not disappoint as others have said , there are numerous pockets and compartments , but i felt it had # key features that were crucial to us first , it was true to description and our # -inch laptop did fit perfectly second , we fully appreciate the construction of it which appears to afford some level of protection for the laptop we 're quite pleased with the both the price and the quality of this case
i needed a bag for a large # . # inch laptop that i travel with this bag is the ticket it is well made , protects the laptop and has several slots to carry many documents
tight fit for my hp # `` but it fits lots of cushion with a neat dome technology lots of extra pockets - use as brief case as well as laptop case i would recommend for # `` or # . # `` laptop not much else would fit too well
this laptop case with dome protection is a `` best buy `` and `` <unk> `` product i just bought two more for family members the case is very well made ; the handle is good quality and the shoulder strap snaps onto the bag with hardware that will last the $ # . # price on amazon is $ # . # off the targus website price of $ # . # am very happy with this purchase
i love this laptop case it 's great it has multiple slots to put your cd 's , cords , folders , or other belongings while still having enough room for your laptop great cushioning , and very easy to carry and you ca n't beat the price
the bag is built well as far as i can tell it has held up no problem to # months of abuse it holds a fair amount of things i can get my laptop , big textbook and two spiral paper notebooks in it pretty easily the only problem is is that the one shoulder design really puts a lot of stress on your shoulder especially well riding a bike with it on the style is ok , it looks pretty good but can appear really `` boxy `` at times if it is full for those who do n't need to ride a bike with it and can deal with the shoulder stress it is a good backpack , otherwise i would look elsewhere
quality and styling are great i carry my macbook pro , cords , and a couple of books in it the mp # <unk> pouch in the sling is nice if you load this down ... the single strap will begin to cause your right shoulder to ache -lrb- ca n't be switched to the left -rrb- so , if you have a heavy load ... get # straps single strap also makes it difficult if running -lrb- to catch the university bus -rrb- or if cycling
got this for my boyfriend he picked it and told me he didnt care about the orange interior -lrb- color he hates -rrb- because the case is ecofriendly <unk> , the orange didnt sound too important he loves it and carries it around the whole country without any hesitation good , and ecofriendly , product
this is an awesome bag i use it for my macbook air do n't really need to carry too much <unk> so this is perfect i like the sling design fits snuggly on my back and the zippers open really easily on this bag unlike my other laptop backs which i had to tug for a bit to open i also love that it 's a `` <unk> `` type of bag love bags with a lot of compartments and this one did n't disappoint plenty of compartments to put my gadgets in
i should have listened to a previous comment the shoulder strap on this is located about # way down the bag which makes for a very wierd <unk> when fully loaded , it rolls to almost horizontal when you pick it up to put it on your shoulder this means that when you put it down it lies down rather than stands up on the little plastic feet looked like a fine bag otherwise , but i sent it back
this bag offers great protection for your notebook with its fine quality padding also has many accessories pockets to store all my bits and pieces for my notebook i like using it in its vertical messenger mode its a little large and there 's a lot of wasted space for me but all in all its quite a nice bag if you have a lot of stuff to take around
i have been pleased with it there is a lot of space beyond computer storage which has ample padding i use it for a # `` tablet pc , so the # `` or so dimension capacity appears to be accurate it replaced my messenger back and having the option of using it as a backpack frees my hands when i need to the various compartment design makes it work well for business use which is how it is being used
i bought this bag in # to replace the crappy computer bag my company gave me and so i could carry tools i used for work everyday as of right now , april # , i 've used this everyday and love it it is big enough that i can fit my external hard drive , precision screwdriver kit , power supply and a few misc . cables riding the train to work everyday and walking in the rain has n't been a problem either i walk # blocks to and from the train station and the bag has held up great my laptop has n't been wet or damaged at all i bought this one and the sling version of the same bag , which i use for my personal use and side business use they are great bags that hold up and are definitely worth it i just got a new mobile workstation and will definitely be looking towards targus for that
bought this for my husband , who wanted a large professional-looking computer bag that was n't too stuffy this is great he loves the convertible strap - great for walking or <unk> holds quite a bit of stuff in addition to the laptop shopped around for prices - amazon 's was the best , especially with free shipping
i was having trouble with back and neck pain from carrying my laptop back and forth to work i found this <unk> messenger bag on amazon at a great price holds the computer with several other <unk> for other papers , etc . great for carrying my laptop back and forth to work - no more <unk> pain for me
i wish i would have loved it ordered twice and received mislabeled bags , labeled # inches on the inside , # on the outside unfortunate waste of time and energy to deal with it , and i still do n't have a bag otherwise , i love the brand and its <unk>
i bought this laptop bag about a month ago and love it it is perfect for my # `` macbook i like how it 's not too bulky but still protects my computer very well the front pocket fits my charger and other small items well i usually just keep my laptop in the case as i use it ; that 's one of my favorite features all in all , i love this bag
it was everything i needed in a case for my chrome book it has enough room and little pockets for all my pencils , pens , papers and charger i like the two carrying options
love the case but would have liked a little more info on what actually fits inside it says dvd or cd 's fit but they seem to be out more than in the sleeve other than that i love it
i have had this product for less than one year and use it only when traveling i have carried it for about # trips and have noticed severe wearing and & # # ; <unk> & # # ; up of the webbed back of the bag i 'm afraid that soon it will wear through i use this bag only to get my equipment through airports and the such and do not use it on a daily basis this wear occurred over about # days of using the bag the bag rubs against my side while carrying it and was rubbing against my jeans only , nothing sharp or overly abrasive i am in the process of sending the product back to tenba and will see how they deal with it i ca n't imagine that i am the only one to experience this excessive wearing of the back webbing material
well designed and nice material but too big for my usage i was hoping & # # ; small & # # ; in the description was <unk> even if the dimensions were suited for me i would probably still have returned because the velcro patches to hold the flap closed seemed overkill in addition to the buckles they were four times bigger than they needed to be and were loud and & # # ; nails on <unk> & # # ; ever time i opened and closed
not enough support or protection for traveling with a laptop and other devices like a kindle the bag collapses on itself when any item is removed the addition of some flexible padding helps i chose it because of all the storage pockets but rarely use it due to it 's inability to stand alone
this is a big messenger bag it 's good but it 's very big i use this when i need to go someplace , set up , and leave it not to easy to walk around with the other downside is that there are no silencers for the velcro it is very loud
this bag is very well made and has a nice layout , except for one thing it has open ends at the top this bag would not do well in the rain or anywhere else where something is blowing around and could get at the main compartment 's contents because of this one shortcoming , i could have easily rated this with just one or two stars
i am very glad to have purchased this bag it is very well made and it has a good number of pockets to store your gadgets i really like the removable camera `` <unk> `` which you could then use the space for clothes , food , etc . the zippers are great and the strap for the bag is alright . not super comfortable one aspect that i do not like is the ends of the bag is exposed . the bag holds well in slight rain -lrb- it is water proof -rrb- but what good is that when there are holes on the sides with the bag closed maybe if the bag is full of gear , the bag will expand to close off the gap i 'm fairly sure that is a construction overlook otherwise , a happy customer
excellent camera bag that can also be used as a book bag has plenty of pockets and zippers very well designed with a comfortable shoulder strap i 've actually used it twice and am still amazed as to the well placed zipper in the center where you can access your camera without opening up the front flap
i <unk> this bag and have found it to be a decent photo bag the inside liner pulls out so you can use the bag for another purpose when you are n't needing it for your camera equipment the top flap clips shuts on the front of the bag , but there is also a zipper along the top that you can use to remove items without opening the flap for quicker access it holds my nikon d # , with a # lens attached , as well as the # on the left side with the right side available for a flash or other small lens or misc . items i got the gray color - but would have preferred the other colors but did n't think the extra cost for a color was justifiable shoulder strap if comfortable and the bag looks nice
this is a great bag so far my only complaints would be the connecting clasps are a little to short when both camera and laptop are in the bag -lrb- planning on making extensions to fix that problem -rrb- the only other problem seems to be fully loaded you are not really able to use all the storage areas carrying camera or the laptop separately the bag is great and a full # stars but together while everything fits it lacks a full use of the bag
well constructed and has lots of <unk> for use as camera bag , laptop bag , book bag , etc . was given as a gift to young woman who teaches and is going to school as well she loves it
i use this bag to carry a d # with an attached # mm lens and a d # with an attached # mm lens together with the lenses facing down i can retrieve either camera through the top zipper while wearing the bag it is the perfect solution to easy access during short photographic hikes
i bought this for my nikon d # , two lenses and flash so far so good i like having a messenger bag instead of a backpack , it is easier to get into in a hurry
i have used this bag for a few months now and am impressed i carry a canon # d with all-purpose lens , zoom lense , and a macro lens along with a # `` laptop the bag handles all of this well , however like some other posts have noted , that 's about all it can handle i would never put my lenses in the bag without the padding , but it takes up a ton of space the build quality is good , the strap is comfortable , it is stylish enough , and the lens padding is easy to remove if you are using the bag for something else highly recommend for those that are looking for a <unk> camera bag
i have not traveled with my bag yet but i did try it out i was able to put my # inch laptop in the back compartment my nikon d # with the # mm lens attached , my # mm wide angle lens and my # mm telephoto lens in the removable compartment along with the above i place my nexus # table in the bag along with the chargers for camera and all devices plus i have room for other things i will need for traveling yes , the bag is pretty heavy but the nice shoulder strap is nice and padded it 's a great bag and will fit my needs nicely
<unk> saw this in a retail shop , liked it over all the others they had for sale and ordered online - less expensive , ya know this bag is <unk> well made - will replace my roll on carry on bag from samsonite the samsonite bag weighed # lbs before i put anything in it and this one holds more than the samsonite well padded compartments there must be # compartments big and small holds my laptop , charger , canon <unk> # and charger , gps , valuables , and papers i usually take on cruise quite well this bag has the best shoulder strap of any bag i have ever seen bottom is rubberized so if you put it down in wet area your stuff wo n't get soaked this is it look no more
just like what the other reviews said and the description from the company used it on my trip to london and it carried all my stuff i wanted to take as a carry on my laptop , my camera , # lenses and all the cords
excellent purchase , it hold everything very organized and light weight , i do n't need to use a purse , it holds it all we travel a lot and i love photography carrying with me several lenses and filters i used to carry my photography bag , my back pack along with my luggage ... the tenba messenger replaced my back <unk> and the photo bag , now combined into one it also holds cell phone , my ipad and a small table <unk> i would recommend it
i love it medium sized bag even though its described as small trust people when they say this much bigger than other medium sized labeled bags tons of storage compartments love the back pocket and the ability to access items via zipper top option the strap makes heavy loads comfortable the only downside i 've found to the bag is that the padded strap is so non slip that you ca n't freely move the bag along your body for example if you wanted to wear the bag behind you and swing it around front to access you have to lift the strap off your shoulder but other than that it 's my favorite bag and i 've owned and tested a lot
but i bought the wrong size i chose the small because my laptop was # . # in which fits great , but when i got home from my trip to hawaii and bought a battery grip , my canon # d started to be a tight fit when packaged with the laptop that being said it does still all fit even with the battery grip , but the depth could be increased by an inch , and i would be happy so <unk> of the story , i guess one size does n't fit all , and subsequently why they have more than one size i love the bag regardless , everything does fit , but its abit to cozy for some of my most delicate electronics this is not there fault so my star rating is independent of that
although i really like the design , the small version is a bit too small for my canon # d mark iii i returned it and ordered the large bag which is perfect
i purchased this bag to compliment my ` all day shooting ' backpack as a ` about town ' bag for this purpose the bag is perfect i love it that it does n't really look like a camera bag plus i 'm a big fan of finally getting a bit of color into my camera kit the quick access zip really comes in handy for those <unk> picture moments the bag can hold a fair amount of kit - this can be a bit of a double <unk> <unk> because when i pack it too heavy it can strain my back , shoulders , and neck the construction of the bag is pretty solid with plenty of padding for the camera gear and neck strap in short this is a great bag if your looking for something to carry around a bit of your kit and not look like your packing expensive equipment
i like this bag because of the various <unk> , long strap and sturdy material i can put a body , three lens , flash and battery chargers in and still have room i love it
i have been through tons of bags for photography equipment , and this is bar none the best one out there i can carry around my # d mark ii , a laptop , and even paperwork , and it never draws attention to itself it does n't matter if you are on a busy subway , traveling abroad , or just throwing the bag in your car - it is well designed , and super convenient the construction is very rugged , and the adjustable compartments are just what a photographer needs there have even been times that i needed to carry <unk> equipment , and the inserts still really came in handy i also love the top zipper that gives you access to the large compartment without having to <unk> the straps - perfect for grabbing your camera out on the fly my dslr even fits in there nicely with a # mm zoom lens for convenience , value , style , and quality , this is the best bag you can invest in
the bag is really quite good it actually is a bit bigger than i imagined it to be , but the quality is fantastic the strap disguises the load on the shoulder very well it does n't bite into the shoulder even when i put a netbook , a nikon d # with two lenses and a flash , a sweater and a <unk> ! !
this bag is deceptively large for its <unk> it holds a dslr with a lens on , two or three other lens plus a flash plus it has room for batteries , memory cards , etc . i love the burnt orange color too it 's different without looking weird
i 've used tenba bags since # when the # # and # # <unk> colored bags first appeared over the years , i 've probably bought more than a dozen tenba bags my # recent purchases of the larger messenger bags , one for my new camera gear and one for a new macbook pro are <unk> of the whole line well thought out , well crafted and great value for the $ $ $ $
i was looking for something that did n't automatically identify me as a tourist the tenba messenger camera bag was exactly what i was looking for there was enough room for my canon rebel t # i , an extra lens , battery , and memory cards , my cell phone and the charger for the t # i battery and there was room for more stuff that i accumulated throughout my trip the zipper at the top let me access all portions of the bag with ease and bonus , we got poured on in <unk> , italy the tenba messenger camera bag kept all of my electronics from getting wet definitely a must have if you are traveling internationally and do n't want to stick out like a <unk>
i have been through # <unk> bags because they always seem to break and tear from the weight this bag rolls like a suitcase and also has backpack capabilities if needed it has already outlasted all of my previous purchases buy this bag ... will easily fit # cameras -lrb- i am using canon # d <unk> 's -rrb- and several lenses , plus all my cords , computer , and usb drives , memory cards , etc .
i bought this item in november for a christmas present it was used for several days when the handle broke sent them a note about it and they said that it was over # days did n't seem to care one bit terrible customer service
this case is certainly a good case for the price paid all of the pockets are large and handy and the padding seems adequate my main negative comment is that the case barely fit the # & # # ; laptop i use for work i really have to squeeze it in in order to close the case also the shoulder strap is a little flimsy and tends to twist up , making it feel a little less secure i carry my computer to clients most days so a sturdy case is very important over all it 's a good deal and does the job for now i do n't know that i will be using it long-term
this is a good basic laptop bag , and much more affordable than the laptop bags that my company typically issues with new systems this bag has a comfortable leather handle , a padded carrying strap , an adjustable padded divider for separating the computer from the accessories , and all the pockets and compartments you need for papers , pens , and accessories the zippers and stitching are durable and look like they 'll last for years the padding is sufficient to protect your laptop from normal wear and tear i like this bag and i love the price i was provided this item for review
i ordered this case for my wife 's laptop and it 's a perfect fit lots of storage and pockets as well as great protection for you laptop ca n't beat it for the price i liked it so much that i bought another for my daughter great protection , great value
although i got a lot of compliments on this bag , the cuteness takes away from the capacity and it just does n't hold up for a frequent traveller i had problems with the quality of the zipper and the collapsible handle
i was very disappointed in the appearance of this bag and have returned it the white <unk> on the black fabric is uneven , <unk> , overlapping and just plain awful it 's too bad because the bag design might have worked for me
it is cute and arrived very quickly that 's the only good thing to say i ca n't figure out why the great reviews unless the only thing you need to carry is your laptop and a tube of lipstick each section is super thin with no expansion ability no room for anything the pull device is rickety and unstable feels like it will break at any minute even that i could have dealt with but the lack of room makes it pretty useless for the business traveller i could n't even make it work for a pleasure trip
this was purchased as a birthday present and was received damaged - one of the wheels on this was completely bent and crooked it was very disappointing i have also heard that the material rips on this as well after we purchased it i would not recommend buying this at all
i purchased this bag as a downgrade from my jansport rolling backpack i needed something smaller for school because my classroom is packed i used the bag today for the first time and it immediately fell apart i opened to get my notebook out of my bag and the plastic support inside the lining of the bag snapped in half when i used the bag this morning i noticed that the telescoping handle was sturdy however , when i left school this afternoon the handle was loose and it was bending i did n't put any abnormal weight on the handle and i only pulled it from my car to class and then from class to my car i ca n't believe what a piece of junk this is i found a sturdier bag at walmart on the way home i am now returning this bag for a full refund
at first i loved this bag plenty of storage room but not heavy unfortunately , the handle broke after # months , so i have to give it a low rating for durability i ca n't afford and do n't want to buy a new bag every year or so
i thought this would be the perfect bag , but it just was n't i wanted a center handle but this one was wobbly , and the bar took up space in the storage area - really cuts down on the file holding space if you have small amounts of files to take , all the extra pockets are great , outside water bottle pocket is nice but somehow all the contour features cuts down on the main function - storage needs to be about # `` more depth to hold files , notebooks for a business trip
this bag was perfect in so many ways , but it has a flimsy pull handle the handle also does not collapse without you manually having to push in # plastic buttons i needed something more sturdy so returned the bag to amazon
this is a cute little roller bag but it seems to have too many gizmos and not enough functionality there are a lot of pockets and zippers i found the zipper pulls to be too small and too flimsy the bag is not roomy i 'd best describe it as a briefcase with wheels my main complaint is the flimsiness of the handle , which twists and feels very loose when i 'm telescoping it up and down i worried that the handle would break or twist apart if the bag was knocked around i think a handle with two support <unk> would be much better i used the bag only once before deciding to return it the bag is cute and aesthetically much more pleasing than other bags but the functionality just is n't there
i have had this for over two years , and i did like it at first the fabric has remained strong and the capacity works fine for me : i use it primarily to carry my laptop , ipad , a few books , etc . to campus -- moderate loads the handle is lightweight and wobbly , but initially worked okay nonetheless but as of the past year , the handle has stopped telescoping properly : it will not retract below the next to highest notch , so it now sticks up at about # feet long it 's not very easy to load into the car , and completely unusable on an airplane i have <unk> and otherwise worked on the handle , but have not been able to restore its <unk> so i would not recommend it unless you are prepared to replace it after two or three years , take it to a repair shop , or do n't mind the <unk> of keeping the handle almost fully extended
i could barely fit more than a laptop and a few books in here , forget a change of gym clothes i quickly broke the & # # ; cup holder & # # ; on the side by putting in a cup that was just the right size , tore the stitching right out it 's light weigh and certainly not expensive -lrb- and at least it has some detail to it , rather than just those boring black bags -rrb- , but you can tell it 's not a high quality product
i am sorry to say i can not recommend this bag i liked the size and weight -lrb- still do -rrb- and , there is a nifty cupholder , a feature i was specifically looking for i 've had the bag for several months and just started using it about six weeks ago the cupholder is unfortunately already torn from the rest of the bag i use this bag primarily for taking my laptop to and from work in my car - so it was not given heavy use at all i am very disappointed now to find something else
if you plan on only using this bag to transport your laptop and tablet this is the bag for you while this bag is very sturdy , it does not hold very much i use this bag for work and really do n't have to transport my laptop but i can hardly fit all the paper work and items i need when working from home so i will say while this bag is really nice and sturdy , i 'm very disappointed with the size for the cost it holds next to nothing
its quite solid durable bag , the wheels are strong enough to bare the weight , however ; i wish if there other designs and colors i use it daily and this the second week from purchasing it . still find it great product though the handle sometime stiff
i was very excited to order this hoping it was going to be a good light solution for someone with a bad back and no need for a giant case which often makes it too heavy i carefully measured my laptop at # . # inches wide and it fits in most other bags even if very tight the first few times unfortunately my # . # inch laptop which is clearly states it `` will fit most `` of on the label and the description will not fit the measurement in the bag is actually # inches for the laptop case at it 's smallest point my laptop stuck out at least a # and inch not a # of an inch as expected i recommend you make sure your laptop is in the # to # / # width range to even consider this bag i 'm truly disappointed i gave it a # because , though the bag did not fit my laptop and was still a bit larger then i wanted , the functionality of it and the look were great back to searching for something that will work : -
i bought this bag for travel i 've been pleased with it for the most part , but it would be so much improved if the handles were slightly longer so it could be carried over the shoulder it 's not a huge bag , but it holds more than i expected just from looking at it i have managed to transport two laptops and a netbook with no problems the largest open space is at the back , around the telescoping handle it 's an odd shape but works for a makeup bag and rolled up jacket
this roller attracts many of my co-workers , fashion and <unk> the issues with me , are a little bigger laptop will not fit inside ; and the zipper hook was broken after i used for a month i like its style and quality other than zipper
i did not want to carry a back pack so i purchased this to carry my laptop and books i was <unk> people on a daily basis so i stopped using this and went to a backpack to many compartments , i could not find what i was looking for in a timely manner i over paid for this item , but it is cute and maybe someday when i get a job where i have to carry lots of files around i will dig it out of my closet pockets to small for an overnight bag it 's also pretty heavy
i was very excited about getting this bag but when i went to put my # . # inch laptop into the bag , it did n't fit width-wise by over an inch i had to send it back i saw later on another web site that this bag is designed for a # -inch or smaller laptop had it not been for the size , i would have kept the bag it 's attractive , compact , with a solid feel i 've had kensington rolling bags before , and they have always held up well
this is a nice bag , but not big enough to carry several books and notebooks for my job at a university the photo does not show it , but the handle is not on the back of the bag , it retracts down into the last zippered area this reduces the amount of available space you can not put books or notebooks in that area the bag appears well made and is attractive it might work for just a laptop and notebook , but not much else
it is a good bag , looks good , but it is on the small side -lrb- which it 's intended to be -rrb- , and the handle is a bit rickety i know it 's not meant for rugged use , but just back and forth to the car and office it has had some use but seems to not be holding up that well -lrb- the wheels and handle -rrb- i switch bags often enough though that that 's not a big deal for me
when i saw this rolling laptop bag , i thought the size would fit my needs i travel quite a bit and wanted something that would accommodate an overnight stay or possibly two nights this bag is better suited for everyday use at the office
i actually love this bag , but the telescoping handle does n't work properly it worked fine for the first few months , but now it wo n't stay up i can extend it at least # quarters of the way , but the last quarter just does n't work anymore it wo n't extend to its maximum length and it does n't & # # ; catch & # # ; so it wo n't stay up i.e . , whenever i stop and let go , then handle just falls all the way back down otherwise the bag is great it has lots of different compartments and has a lot of room to hold everything you need and it 's very stylish
it really is a very pretty bag , but to my dismay i found that the main compartment would not open up wide enough for my files this is due to the fact that the zipper on main compartment does not go down all the way on one side because of a bottle holder i would rather have a zipper that goes all the way down for easy access to main compartment than a bottle holder -lrb- they could have made a bottle holder somewhere else where it does n't interfere with the zipper -rrb- i am returning and will be buying something else that will allow full access to compartments
