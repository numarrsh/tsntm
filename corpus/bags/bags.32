this case is just simply awesome ! it is exactly as it was described ... fit perfectly and was easy to put on i really love the legs in the back that pop out , so you can make sure your laptop gets the proper ventilation to prevent overheating it came quickly and was packaged well great product and great seller
the new unibody macbooks seem to scratch a lot easier than the old ones did i recommend this case for protecting the computers good looks the case just snaps on and it covers the outer surface of the laptop the hard shell also gives the computer some additional protections i like the clear since the original finish looks good with it
i was a little worried about the quality of this case because of the price but i was quick to find that this is a great case the legs are also a great added feature to keep airflow under the macbook and help to keep it cool i bought mine from ebay and it came with a free keyboard cover i would recommend this to anyone with a mac book why not protect your $ # investment with a $ # cover you 'd be silly not to
i purchased a speck hard shell case a year before purchasing this mcover the other case had cracked right on the corner where it was supposed to snap on however , this case seems more durable and hopefully i wo n't have to purchase another one in a year i like the matte finish and the retractable feet this is a great thin case for my computer
an almost perfect product protects that mac unibody lightweight , transparent to reveal that mac beauty i 've had one on a # macbook and when i took it off to sell it , it looked ... mint at $ # it 's a no brainer and , the low cost -lrb- fair -rrb- and fast shipping to canada was icing on the cake
this is the # nd one i buy -lrb- got tired of the black one i had but it still works fine after # yrs -rrb- and i actually bought one for my teenage sister my only complaint about this new model is that the feet are too long so it 's uncomfortable to type if you want to use them , so i just do n't and it 's perfectly fine it 's easy to snap on . . a bit tricky to snap off but not a deal breaker , easy to clean and it protects my macbook pro # & # # ; from scratches
this cover was exactly what i expected it does a great job protecting my new mac the hard plastic is very durable and strong i feel sure that my mac will live through any mishap that might happen it was easy to install , with snap-on clicks to indicate when it was fully on the slits on the bottom prevent the laptop from getting overheated
the macbook pro clear cover we purchased works well , looks good , and the small pop-out feet at the rear of the bottom give a little lift so the keyboard becomes a bit easier to use very easy to snap on and off , all accessories and ports are accessible when case is attached
i dinged my macbook pro a few months ago and was saddened by the mark that was left on the side i decided to get a hardshell case and was deeply <unk> by the # price point for the hardshell cases in the apple store i shopped amazon and immediately remembered coming across some other brand cases a few months ago for my macbook pro the case works as expected , went on in # minutes and fits perfectly
second protector for my macbook pro after another brand started cracking and pieces began falling off the ipearl case fits very well i like the clear color and love the little kickstands wish it had more tack to it for gripping
very pleased w/this product tightly designed , snaps on well and stays on and i really like the feet in the rear that slightly elevate the laptop so as to dissipate heat
make sure you know your mac 's model number at first , i had brought this case for the other model it was a little too small i did n't realize that there were too different versions available overall , i 'm very pleased with this purchase and i was able to exchange the wrong case for the right one , so i highly recommend using this <unk>
after trying several different types of covers for my macbook pro i was happy to discover this cover it snaps on easily and looks terrific it allows for easy access to all posts , etc . i purchased the clear version and feel confident in the protection this cover provides for my macbook
this case feels durable and gives me peace of mind that my macbook pro # `` is well protected i owned a speck case a year ago and the difference is obvious . ipearl case was less expensive which makes it a no brainer ! in addition to the great case , the free keyboard cover that comes with it does a great job protecting the keyboard without obstructing the keys while typing i had a keyboard cover prior to this one that required me to press hard on the keys because the cover was <unk> up the keys
i 'm very pleased with the cover i was a little worried when i ordered it thinking that it might not match the ports of the new macbook pro i just bought but when i put it on it was a great fit thanks i would order again ps i like the see through of the cover to see the apple glowing when it 's on
this product is very easy to install and covers your entire macbook , while leaving access to ports i looked at various cases and was very pleased with the look and price of this product it is sturdy , yet lightweight this case does not take away from the sleek look of your macbook ; it offers the right protection and still keeps your mac looking like a mac ! !
i bought this cover to protect the latest macbook pro # . # `` purchased in february # the cover came promptly and fits perfectly it 's tight and protects the beautiful finish quite well i went with the clear version , so the nice silver finish of the macbook shines through it 's easy to put on i did remove it once to do a better job of removing dust from the laptop and that was a bit of a challenge , but a tight fit is the point , right as other reviewers have noted , once installed the cover does limit how far back you can move the screen that 's unfortunate , but i believe it 's unavoidable in a cover that does the job we 've paid for it to do -- protection i recommend and would buy this cover again
after <unk> the <unk> of protective cases available for the # `` macbook pro - i chose this one if you want a minimalist look , easy assembly , and durable protection - this seems to be a great choice in the marketplace , it was at a fair , economical price upon unpacking it , it was literally a snap to assemble - - - pop on the bottom and the top and voila , it 's done the thickness of the clear plastic case offers durability the laptop 's exterior design shows through beautifully two small fold-down legs on the bottom are able to be easily dropped down to provide nearly # `` of ventilation space at the <unk> , when set on a desktop nothing to complain about it 's a simple and elegant cover that works and protects well
i just got the cover and it fits my mac perfectly , it 's not loose at all the only issue i have is that the clear cover is not truly clear the matte finish has the cover in a <unk> i personally wanted a more clear translucent cover but honestly it 's not a huge <unk> it 's a great cover and the keyboard cover fits nicely too i also love the pegs
not the most beautiful case out there , but for the price and functionality - it meets my expectation and budget i really like that it has # foldable little feet that i can open to tilt my macbook to a comfortable typing angle
this product was a perfect addition to my new macbook air i wanted a protective case but wanted it match the sleek nature of the product the best part , of course , are the legs that allow you to prop up the laptop at an angle for more comfortable typing it 's the legs , in fact , that get comments all the time `` where did you get that ? the legs are meant to <unk> , much like a side <unk> on a car this is good - to prevent them from breaking , but they tend to pop off at times when you are n't paying attention like when you 're in a hurry and jamming the computer in your pack as you run out the door i recommend buying a couple extra legs to have on hand if you travel or move the computer often i will be purchasing these cases for as long as i own macbooks
the clear case is exactly what i was looking for since the mac looks great , why cover it in another color this case snapped on easily , fit the machine , and i had no problems with it being able to be fully open i like the little legs on the case , it gives the macbook , just the right angle i highly recommend this
this case was perfect for what we needed it for , my husband is in the navy and goes on the ships so this is to protect his computer and seems to do the job so far
i was worried about buying a brand that was n't the `` official apple <unk> `` brand that they sell in the apple stores , but this one is great very light weight , does not interfere with operation of the laptop , and love the built in feet that give the laptop a slight angle for better typing
easy to install , the clear looks great durable with vent holes on the bottom i liked it so much i bought # more one for my girlfriend and one for my father great price too
i keep my laptop in a stand up container beside my <unk> the cover makes it less slippery i got the idea from my wife who has used this cover on her macbook air for some time fits perfectly and a snap to install
i love this case i 've put them on # of my mac computers over the years and have n't had one break yet it provides superb protection for my mac the keyboard case that comes with it is great , but if you like to type really fast without putting a lot of effort into the keys , then you should upgrade to the uppercase ultrathin keyboard case i did n't know what i was missing until i tried the uppercase keyboard <unk>
after days of searching for the perfect case for my new macbook , i found the ipearl i was surprised at the price -- especially in comparison to the other cases on the market i was resistant to it at first because of this , but i decided to take a chance based on the reviews i 'm so glad i did because it 's great it 's super easy to pop on , and it fits pretty well it does n't make my macbook <unk> bulky or heavy , but i still feel that it is being protected my one concern would be that the legs do scare me a bit as they seem to be a little flimsy , but i have n't used them enough to really form much of an opinion bottom line -- this case is a fantastic buy for the price
the aluminum casing on the macbook pro is very very nice i did n't want it to get scratched or dented because aluminum is not a strong metal so i ordered this clear hard shell case and was very pleased that it was easy to put on the macbook and it fit like a glove it protects but you can see right through it to the beautiful aluminum finish i like that it 's hard because it resists dents it 's good value for the money too i 'm very happy with this purchase and would recommend it
nice compact laptop case but still protective i like that it is clear so you can still put stickers and what not on it snaps into place very easily for only # bucks definitely worth it
i used this case on my macbook pro for about three months and the last time i took it off , i noticed that the case had actually scratched the unibody on the front of the macbook this product is suppose to protect from scratches , but it does the exact opposite make sure to cut away any excess plastic seams and make sure to take the case off to clean every so often , but i would invest a little more and get the more expensive brand
not much to say , this did n't fit the computer , the material felt cheap , not at all the type of cover someone shelling out the cash for a macbook would be ok with
this plastic case was flimsy and cheap i have a # `` macbook pro with another cover that was sturdy and does n't feel like it 's going to <unk> apart when you tap it buy a different brand
shipping was great it fits snug but the material looks cheap and used there 's a square around the apple logo which looks tacky would not recommend buying the black because this problem seems to be specific to the black
piece of crap . returned it . feet on bottom case are nice , but i got the black one and it just looks like cheap garbage the top piece does not fit good i tried to flip it after reading other reviews , but the middle of the case at the top and bottom does not secure , no matter the orientation so the top just does not fit flush also , the hinge for the lid hits on the bottom of the case , clicks every time you open it guy at work has a speck brand case and it is # x times nicer than this one was hoping this made in the usa case would do it but it 's junk
the material is not good - used cheap materials ... could accept it only if it did not also have the fit issue the bottom part 's left upper corner does not fit ... feels awkward ... the case is also relatively heavier than other cases simply put , it has unacceptable quality it should be advised that when this kinds of case does not fit perfectly , dust can easily trapped inside the case and that will scratch your macbook pro , defeating the point of getting this kinds of cumbersome case good luck for you guys
it 's an ok case over all two of the tabs that hook onto the macbook broke off when i was carefully taking the case off to clean same thing happened to the lid kind of wished i invested in a speck case instead , but i guess this one will do until it completely breaks
it 's a pain to put on and take off it 's really cheap because it 's cheap looking and feels cheap takes away from the beautiful mac design the top part is so heavy it makes my screen fall depending on which direction it 's leaning the only reason this gets two stars is because i like the keyboard cover it comes with i highly recommend you choose a different case
looks <unk> the new retina # `` <unk> feel -lrb- little or no slip while handling your laptop purchased this # days ago , and it 's already beginning to crack all over the
this case is well built but the top of the case does not fit well i have had a few cases from different companies before and the top of the case that protects the screen has always fit snug and tight this case bows up in the middle and does not fit snuggle enough for me to feel comfortable about it not sliding around and damaging my macbook i will be returning this asap one good note however is that the bottom of the case is awesome the vent holes are functional and the feet in the back are great for keeping the temp of the computer down while i am playing games or using it heavily i have never ordered anything from ipearl before but i think this may be the last time i order from them
i do n't know what i was expecting this shell is cheap if you want something that is cheap and bulky , get this if you want something that looks and feels nice -lrb- i 'm guessing that 's why you bought a mac -rrb- do n't get this spend an extra # bucks and get something nice on the other hand , it does its job the little flip stand on the bottom is nice , but it makes the laptop extremely bulky
it does work , snaps right on to the # macbook none retina it was totally not what i was expecting from the reviews , very cheap plastic , legs break off very easily the edges on the bottom cover are always getting caught on something , like my shirt sleeve , etc . . not happy with it but there seems to be a lot of fans on amazon review
it is very hard to remove i was afraid f breaking the cover or even my screen when i was trying to remover it the keyboard cover that comes together is useless
this case is good if you 're on a budget i have had my case for a couple of months now and it is sturdy the case still has not fallen off or broken the bottom section of the case is matted but the two lifted rubber stoppers and stands make the laptop lift off the surface high enough where you do not have to worry about scratches however , the bottom of the computer does get dirty so , taking off the case for cleaning is recommended the top part of my case does not have clips on the bottom of it which is frustrating if you want the case to stay snug on your screen nevertheless , it does well and worth the low price
the case itself looks nice , and i absolutely love the <unk> kickstand that puts the laptop at a better angle for typing unfortunately , one of the rubber feet that stops it from sliding has come off and gotten lost the glue that was on there apparently was not strong enough to last more than a couple months the design of the case also has trouble accommodating the magsafe power adapter when it 's sticking out the back instead of towards the front it can still connect , but just barely my package came with a rubber keyboard cover , but my understanding is that not all of them do mine serves its purpose but is a magnet for lint and stray hairs and looks terrible but i imagine if i spilled beer on my laptop again it would be better protected
it does it 's job but it does n't look as slick as kuzy 's macbook pro case the middle of the top case does n't exactly touch my laptop , it kind of bumps out a little bit , but that 's probably the only thing that bugs me
i just received my case today there 's a few things that i dislike about this case i got the black case and i ca n't see the apple logo through the case at all it is also hard to take the case off when it 's on your macbook not only that , the case is pretty heavy and the packaging was kind of cheap there was a hair in my packaging too some good things are that it has a venting system so your mac does n't get over heated also there is some air space between the case and your macbook which helps prevent scratches the looks of it are n't that pleasing but it seems sturdy enough to protect my mac book i guess
i figure with an item like this you 're only looking for a few aspects to make it a good product quality materials , fit , and finish material quality seems high fit : fit is perfect finish is lacking sharp edges from molding lines require sanding and if you want it to look nice , <unk> on my particular case , it appears that someone took a knife to the top edge of the piece that protects the top of the laptop if they were trying to take the flash off , it was a terrible job , i wish i could post a pic i would have preferred the sharp edges and could have done them myself
the bottom part of the case is very firm and secure while the top half of the cover does n't seem to stay in place . upon opening the the laptop the cover just comes out of place
this case is just okay for the price it is not the best fit i have the brand new macbook pro and it is not a perfect fit you can also see your fingerprints on the case when you touch it
it 's an ok shell , it fits well , it 's fairly solid but it 's not very aesthetically pleasing especially compared to some of the more expensive ones if it did it over i would probably shell out the extra # bucks for a better one
this product does a great job at protecting your mac snaps on perfectly and keeps the metal finish nice and what not the plastic itself is a cheap grade , feels kind of clunky , and aesthetically , does n't do much maybe should have tried another color again , for the price , a good protection for your machine
when you put on the cover , the lid has almost a ` bubble ' over the mac , so it does not fit flush against the unit also , when you go to open the mac - the cover will pop off not a good case
i 'm in college , so i use my laptop every day this is a hard plastic case it has a few rubber feet on the bottom the bottom flip outs eventually broke and got in the way , then soon all of the clips that hold the case onto the laptop started to break until the case was just falling apart
the case snaps on easily and the <unk> for standby and battery status are still visible through the cover the <unk> feet help to elevate the back end off the table to allow airflow and raise the display slightly i have not noticed any situations where the case blocks the ports ; however , there is a flaw in the back of the cover that catches the case when i open the lid this causes the case to & # # ; click & # # ; every time i open the display , which means pressure is being put on the case or the laptop itself i expect this will lead to the case cracking or breaking at some point
i recieved my cover promptly but i am a little dissappointed with the top of the cover it does n't fit snugly and looks kind of cheap although it does serve it 's purpose of protecting my mac i wanted to buy a different color but it only showed black online for my # `` mac book pro the slotted bottom of the cover with the little leg stands is a great feature
this is the only case i 've ever bought for my macbook its nice because it keeps it from getting scratch and allows me to put stickers on it without being concerned of removing them later however the stands attached to the bottom broke pretty easily other than that it 's an alright product
after opening the box , my overall thought was , & # # ; this plastic seems cheap and not something i would want on my $ # laptop the top part of the case does n't hug the back of the screen like i would have liked it too i used the case for about one day im # % certain there are better cases out there for your macbook pro the price is good , and now i know why ! !
nothing wrong has happened to my computer since i got the case - it works as it should the feet in the back , i personally do n't use , but they 're useful whenever i do decide to flip them up in my opinion they help a lot to cool off the bottom when on a hard surface the rubber feet in front are a great idea , except one of them fell off really easily and did n't stay on again with superglue it 's so small that i lost it , and it 's making my computer uneven but also <unk> since only one of the four corners stays put on a solid surface i 'm not upset with my purchase , i just wish that i could find a way to replace my lost rubber foot because it renders the whole bottom of the case useless to it 's purpose
this item was purchased overall , it provides good protection for my computer , but it is loose around the edges it has not fallen off of my computer yet , but it does not fit as snugly as my previous cases i have had for this computer otherwise , i would have given this item a # star
this shell is great looking it adds color to the look of my macbook pro and protects it from bumps and scratches one feature that i loved about this case were the retractable feet i do not have to buy a separate product to change the angle that my laptop is inclined there are also a pair of rubber feet that offer better traction on surfaces than the feet on the bottom of the macbook pro they are thicker too there are a couple of minor drawbacks to this particular shell this model fits my laptop -lrb- mid- # -rrb- perfectly but it limits the angle that i can open the lid somewhat the other drawback is that this shell does not allow the redesigned magsafe power adapter to clip securely to the macbook
i think this is a great cover for my # . # mac it fits `` almost `` perfectly the top half is a little tricky to snap in but i may not be doing it right overall , i was very happy with the cover and feel better it is protected i especially like the way the apple still lights up even though the black cover is on i would definetely order again from the same seller , however , i notice now its on sale for $ # and i paid more :
this glossy hard cover does the trick overall , a great protective cover that 's a cinch to install really appreciated the spare -lrb- free -rrb- keyboard cover included in my shipment glossy , and black in color , it is easy to see scuffs and wear from regular use the hinged `` rests `` on the bottom are a nice feature , but it would be nice if they `` locked `` into place when storing
it does fit perfectly and it does n't block out the light from the apple insignia when your macbook is open the other thing i like about it are the stands that are foldable it allows for the case to give a lot more & # # ; breathing & # # ; room for your macbook to circulate air for cooling this thing is wonderful
nice little case , fits my mac book pro # . # perfectly there are tiny plastic tabs that clip over the top and bottom of the laptop , making it very snug . very good product
the material of the case feels nice to the touch the top and bottom panels snap into place with relative ease and create a snug fit with the computer the various ports and cd drive are accessible with the case on the bottom of the case is vented to allow for better heat dissipation there are also small tabs on the bottom that unfold , allowing the computer to sit at an elevated angle to help with posture for only # bucks , i 'd recommend this case
everything is better in black , and i mean everything , black on black on black oh it also allows for you to lift the base up and get airflow under the laptop , which reduces overheating
i purchased this cover to protect my new macbook pro it fits nicely and snaps right on no instructions were included with the cover , so i had to remove the top lid and reset it to get it on right i wanted to purchase it in a different color as well , but i 'm afraid to remove it i would imagine a break of these clips and it will not be as useful as i had hoped so far , no issues with it works just fine and is keeping my laptop ding free i would purchase another one , just need to have a lot of patience removing the cover also , received the plastic keyboard cover with it i 'm satisfied with it , especially the price
it was very good does n't quite work with the new unibody laptop macbook pro and it does n't protect from water fully otherwise , this is a fantastic product i would totally get it again
i bought this for the powerbook pro w / light <unk> plug the lcd screen 's adjustable range is severely limited the cover adds weight to the lcd if using your laptop in a <unk> position the lcd will fall shut normal operating temp is ~ # degrees higher using the case i like the hard case to protect the system from dents , but the exposure below are vulnerable to dents the color is a dark <unk> brown not black the bonus keyboard cover , a nice add on ; not too pretty but works well
i bought one of these in <unk> # at the start of the school year it worked great for over a year until <unk> # one of the feet on the bottom cracked i almost bought an entirely new mcover , but after research i found that you can buy feet for $ # from ipearl even though one of the feet failed i was going to purchase another mcover but was saved by finding out for # bucks i can just buy a new set of feet to prop it up i think that this case is a good buy and it has definitely been ever thing that i needed it to be i 'd recommend it
fits perfectly and looks great only downside is that screen can only open to about # degrees before the top cover hits the back cover not a horrible thing but can be inconvenient in positioning the laptop . skin on keyboard is also a <unk> fit i would use this product again
this case worked great on my # & # # ; macbook pro the feet helped my laptop stay nice and cool after about # months one of the feet broke off i will be buying a new case just like this
great hard case for my # `` macbook pro , looks fairly subdued and non-descript the only thing that is a bit disappointing is that the logo is n't really visible unless the brightness is rather high
as a college student , i do n't have money to burn but , if i have something really expensive , i try to keep it protected i was noticing several of my friends were scratching the outside of their macbooks and i was paranoid that i was going to do the same there are many different makes of hard shell cases , the mcover hard shell case is pretty cheap compared to most but , the quality is about the same the retractable feet are a nice touch that i really enjoy and did n't even notice in the product description , originally if you are concerned for your computer , or at least you do n't want to scratch it , i suggest getting this
so far i love it but as mentioned previously the top piece does not fit perfectly , it bows and creates a rubbing - hopefully this wo n't create scratches so for the money it 's great , if they fix the top cover design it 'll be perfect
this laptop hard body cover for my laptop was pretty cheap and was delivered on time sadly i have ordered the wrong size myself and will have to send it back to get a # & # # ; case instead but despite that i have no complaints and to only blame myself for this mistake
bought this for a friend of mine who wanted to protect his mac investment he was satisfied with the durability of this product it looked as advertised and worked as expected he did n't drop it so i doubt it was pushed to the limit but it did resist scratches that result from regular daily use and misuse worth considering to protect your investment
nice product . fit my computer very well . i gave # stars because the plastic material in black leaves fingers marks and are very hard to remove . it gives the impression that is dirty
i purchased the apple with retina display and was really excited about this laptop i do a lot of <unk> which requires that i travel with my laptop for various things well , during my last <unk> i dropped my laptop once and it went bouncing around in my car a few times i decided that i needed to protect my # k dollar investment so , i purchased this hard cover it took a little <unk> to get it snapped into place , but i love it it provides good protection and is easy to grip and carry the case does not interfere with any of the slots or closing the laptop i would recommend this product
i bought one from spek it was nice and had an interesting texture to it the problem with that one was that the bottom was soooo closed off that it would overhead , and felt like my laptop was going to die since the fan was constantly running i finally bought this one and replaced the bottom cover honestly i had this one for two months and there has not been an excessive overheating and fan running the bottom has enough holes to allow the mac 's heat to escape covers enough to prevent scratching i didnt like the shinny cover but it is what it is
my boyfriend really liked it and it 'll do why it 's supposed to which is protect his mac i like how you could still see the apple so it 's a good buy
i was pleasantly surprised with cost to quality pricing for this hard shell case my wife bought one for her powerbook pro from the apple store and paid # dollars for it it lasted just over a year until the tabs cracked and it would n't stay on i can say that this unit is better engineered time will tell how the plastic holds up , but the <unk> and tabs this case has is a superior design and fits really snug make sure you get it on right the first time because its difficult to get off the venting for the bottom section is better designed and the computer seems to run cooler my wife loves the added bonus of the silicon key protector , but i find that it impedes typing a bit and you have to <unk> the keys just a bit harder for the letters to register all in all nice product so far and happy with this purchase
i acquired this shell last week i am pleased with it installation was a breeze - it clipped on with no difficulty there is a video showing how to do this if i have one negative comment -lrb- and to the best of my <unk> this may not be possible and still protect the machine -rrb- is that the cover limits the <unk> angle of being able to open the cover it opens just slightly past <unk> overall , i am extremely happy with the purchase which was done at the recommendation of someone else .
i got this case and really enjoyed how simple it was to install , and it also looks great too the customer service was great all the way through the process i like the feet on the bottom to help keep the laptop safe and grip well it snaps right on - and that 's it !
snaps in quickly and easily , with no fears of it falling off or easily breaking it looks good , steal thing out my macbook till the glowing apple shines thru the top cover the only minor drawback is when my wrist is sitting on the edge of the case using the mouse , i can sometimes feel the cases plastic edge pressing into my palm otherwise , it 's a great case
the product is awesome it fits really snug and protects your computer from scrapes and other minor damages i would definitely recommend this to someone looking for a cover for their macbook
put it on when i # st got it - fits like a dream . i could n't <unk> my hands across the plastic - it 's so sleek - kickstand and rubber at the bottom are great - design is cool - you can still access the plug <unk> - ca n't bend the screen back all the way - you can still see finger prints on it but you just wipe it off - you can still see the apple logo thru the <unk> than that i would recommend this case - especially for the price . similar products would go for twice as much . this product is sleek and sexy * still have n't gotten the keyboard cover yet
as the title says ... good price ... not a perfect product , but it works as advertised and has protected my computer only things i do n't like # -rrb- a bit on the heavy side ... ads a good amount of bulk to the laptop # -rrb- screen does not open all the way ... but we 're not talking about a lot here ... was not an issue for me # -rrb- kind of cheap feeling
its a little cheap but its what was expected it props the computer up a bit and makes for a more comfortable experience if you are worried about making a great looking product like the macbook look cheap then dont get it i just wanted something to put on the computer when i use it from home
had a choice of going with the ipearl or the incase a buddy of mine had the incase , i however got the ipearl the only difference i can see between them is the price ! ipearl was half the price of the incase
i bought this case for my macbook pro because i wanted to protect it it fits very well in the laptop and it overall looks cool there are minor things that could be improved as in where the button on the side is to check you battery it is had to push with your own fingers unless you use a pen or pencil or your nail the top cover also does not tight with the top of the laptop -lrb- i can push the middle part and it goes down -rrb- it also scratches very easily but it is there to protect the laptop so it does its job so overall this case did make my laptop look cool but it had some issues
decent plastic case i really like the flip out legs on the bottom when typing the case is sufficient enough to guard against ding and scratches you can still faintly see the lit apple logo , but only faintly for $ # , it does exactly what i bought it for
the <unk> is very good has a matte finish that is pretty smooth unlike in the pic , my apple logo isnt that clear through the shell if thats what you want the bottom of the case is <unk> -lrb- not one continuous piece like the top -rrb- also has small stands that are kind of neat
fit fits well enough people are correct when saying there is gaping between the top cover and the mbp , but it does the job in protecting your investment if you are on a budget , its worth it , otherwise spend for the more commercial brands
its a nice case , i like the built in feet to help keep it cool and now i can customize my mac with a lot of stickers without messing it up
i 've had this for almost a year now and it works great protects my macbook from scratches well the flip up legs do scratch my desk top a little if you slide the laptop around at all the benefit still <unk> this minor negative detail
the bottom of the case fits well and is a good design the top case seemed to fit really loose and would come off too easily i ended up using the bottom of this case and the top of another case together
i ' ll simply agree with all the other # star reviews ! , it 's well worth the few bucks i also got the <unk> # . # neoprene sleeve/bag for macbook/macbook pro , & said the following ! i really <unk> this & # # ; cover/sleeve ! , it 's just & # # ; so cool ! & # # ; i like it ! , it has this certain feel of security & comfort that just makes you want to leave the macbook in it whatever you 're looking for get this regardless ! i still have a hard cover on it from ipearl ! , but this you just ca n't beat the comfort it brings both of you -lrb- u & mac : -rrb- in addition
those , who consider buying it is not a fancy staff , but rather a practical and safe way to protect your mac do not hesitate this is a great product , and worth the money you pay
