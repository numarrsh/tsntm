i love this sleeve as with most sleeves , there 's not a whole lot of padding if you 're looking for protection then you should find something else this is a product that will help prevent scratches and minor nicks as your laptop jostles around in your bag overall , it does what it 's supposed to and the look is pretty fantastic my only quibble is that it 's a really tight squeeze for my # `` air i know you want the sleeves snug but it 's a bit of struggle to get it in there wish there was a tiny bit more room
loving this case it fits my samsung chromebook perfectly and is super cute only thing is there re # d rings for a strap i hope yet , no strap was included i do n't care about a strap but if none is provided do n't put the d rings this is n't going to protect your book from a lot just general light moisture , dust and the like
this case is great not only does it look good , but it protects my mac when it gets bounced around i work on an <unk> and my computer is constantly getting shoved behind a seat and knocked around this case is keeping it protected very well the only downside like most other people had stated is the strong chemical smell when you first open it it took a couple of days for the smell to disappear , but other than that , i definitely recommend getting this case
this laptop case is much sturdier than i expected , and like many other reviewers have said , it is more orange than it appears in the picture nonetheless , i really like it and have gotten plenty of compliments on it i have an hp dv # us # . # `` laptop and even with the # -cell battery in the computer my laptop fits in this case without being too tight my only complaint is that i wish the case had handles to carry it , but at least it does have clips on the side where a strap can be attached there is also a strange rubbery smell when you first take the case out of the box , but that goes away after about a week or so
i 'm very certain <unk> a strap for this sleeve will be a piece of cake , but it is an inconvenience that no strap was provided with purchase i am thankful for the hooks they provide , but what would make this amazing is the strap i 'm satisfied with my purchased the sleeve is completely adorable and fits my style perfectly thank you , digittrade ! :
this item is beyond cute and seems to be well made my only complaint is the smell it is awful and i had an instant headache and <unk> nose as soon as i opened it i will set it outside for a few days to air out and hopefully then the stench will dissipate
the picture on the computer gives the impression that the background is white or <unk> , but it is gray the colors are vibrant and the inside of the sleeve is the bright <unk> that matches the flowers
i really like the design of this case , as do my friends i use my laptop to create electronic music a lot , so i think it fits well the inside and outside is a very soft neoprene the inside zipper track has a tiny sleeve so that the zippers do n't scratch your cover up my laptop is # . # `` and it fits well with a little bit of extra space for the power chord or mouse i 'd prefer that it be on an outside pocket so that i dont scratch my case cover it also has two <unk> hooks on each side , however it doesnt come with the strap i carry my computer in my backpack , so there is plenty of room for accessories if you dont carry a backpack , i suggest you purchase something more <unk>
i actually got this for my asus vivobook # . # & # # ; touch screen ultrabook while it does fit , i feel it 's a little too snug aside from that , it 's a great little sleeve , and will work well for your # . # & # # ; slim notebook or laptop one thing that i did love was that the orange color was a lot more vibrant in person i would definitely recommend this product
agree with others fine protection for laptop strong rubbery odor which i expect will dissipate over time inspiron with # . # inch display and # cell battery fits nicely in sleeve ; not much wiggle room same laptop with # cell battery is too large for the sleeve
it fits my # . # & # # ; toshiba with no problems have not tried using a strap with it if you are looking for a case that will save your laptop if dropped , keep looking however , this cover suits my purposes perfectly fine : it offers some light protection and is thin enough to fit in a backpack with a big textbook plus , the design has gotten a few compliments
i bought this for my # year old neice it is really cute and offers good protection as other reviews have said it did have a funky smell to it it wasnt over <unk> i figure it was from what the sleeve is made from my neice hasnt said anything about the smell recently so i assume it must have wore off i would definately purchase another one it was a great deal
love this bag it 's functional , protective and pretty it has enough extra room for my cord and some other stuff only complaint is that it has hooks for straps but does not come with one i would have expected that for the price -lrb- since it was n't dirt cheap -rrb- i happen to have had a black strap from another bag so i use that it works well
the sleeve is of good quality color 's bright and the design is cute the only thing to complain is that when i first took it out of the package , it smelled really and heavily weird , just like the plastic now it 's months later , the smell is still noticeable , although much lighter generally , i like the sleeve
this case is really cute it fits over my macbook pro perfectly and also gives it just a little more padding while i 'm traveling or going to class this has great color and the design is very tasteful . this case is also really well constructed and i 'm very impressed
i would have given this # stars , but , it did not come with a carrying strap , although the clips are there i had an extra one , so it worked out also it is a bit `` smelly `` when you first open it the smell went away after a couple of days my large computer fits perfectly and the price was just right
i measured this product for my hp laptop and its a little too big for it however its better that its too big than too small , i 'll probably stuff a cloth in the back to ensure it does n't move much
this bag is soo cute fits my hp touchsmart like a glove -lrb- even though the screen is # ' -rrb- i 'm glad i went a little bigger i can smell what the others are talking about , but if you do n't smell it directly i 'm sure ts fine to the one who smelled their laptop , i do n't think other people will go around smelling your lap top anyways i really like this bag , by only wish was that it came with a bag strap , i mean it already has the <unk> not just add in the straps
this is a very nice sleeve - it appears to be of very good quality the only issue with it is that especially since this is a large laptop , it is hard to pick up without any sort of handle or strap to pull out of my bag i have to grab a hunk of the material around the zipper as i pull it out or set it into my bag , hoping i do n't drop it because it 's a bit slippery other than that , it 's really a nice cover
this notebook sleeve is exactly what it says it is and exactly what i was looking for the fabric used is perfect to keep my computer padded and safe the design is cool and `` not too girly `` as my husband says
i bought this sleeve not long ago for my toshiba nb # netbook and it fits perfectly it does n't have a separate pouch for your computer accessories and it smells kind of funny when you first get it , but it 's a very attractive sleeve that protects your netbook from the outside world i knew when i bought it that it did n't have a pouch for a mouse or a carrying handle ; these were n't features that i really cared about , though i love the design on the case and have gotten a number of compliments about it the material is soft yet protects my netbook from scratches and other damage i have n't had a single functional problem with it so far my sole complaint is that it smelled weird when i first received it i 'm not sure why , but it was n't anything that a little febreeze and airing out could n't fix it smells completely fine now -lrb- i 've had it for a few months -rrb-
this sleeve is perfect for my macbook pro # in i like the fact that it has the hooks on side to latch onto a strap , the colors are pretty and great for the spring the quality seem durable only had it for # month and im very pleased
very pleased with this -- it 's quite cute previous reviewers are not kidding when they said the sleeve has a pretty noxious petroleum product smell -- i ended up leaving it outside in the sun for a few days so it could <unk> however , that 's all that was required
i like the case -- it 's big enough and does the job efficiently , but i was really looking forward to the case in the picture i received a grey case with the pictured pattern on it instead it 's a pretty dark grey too oh well , i do n't feel like dealing with the hassle of a return the smell everyone keeps talking about was n't overpowering like i expected it just has a new product smell to it , but i really did n't notice until i <unk> it to see what everyone was talking about i really do n't plan on <unk> the case in the future , so i 'm good with it also annoying that a strap does n't come with it -- i purchased one , but it does n't match , so that bothers me too
this case was definately what i expected the only thing i didnt agree on was that the sizing is wrong its much bigger then # ' # my laptop case is # ' # and the case was alittle big . but overall it will do
it is a perfect fit for my # `` annoying hooks , when i obviously ca n't use them cause my laptop is big and heavy and that looks too weak . -- overall , good to carry , nice to look at , reasonably priced
the case arrived very quickly and was exactly as described i have a # `` macbook pro and it fit perfectly the only reason it does n't get the full five stars is that there is a horrendous chemical smell associated with the case i 've been airing it out the last two days but other then that the case rocks
it fits my # . # compaq presario i was worried because i feel like my laptop is heavy and big although it did n't come with a strap and does n't fit my computer cord , the computer itself fits nicely in my backpack which is why i even went with a sleeve and not a case or a bag most likely use this when i buy a smaller laptop later as well already received compliments people get a laugh out of seeing a cassette again ... well those who remember them anyway
it 's a little smaller then i thought but my laptop just fits into it so i can not complain the delivery was quick and easy although i just received it today , i am quite thrilled to use
the sleeve is the most magnificent thing i 've found it not only fits my # . # inch hp however it has an overwhelming chemical scent it comes out and you can get a terrible headache i have found a way though to make it go away -lrb- just turn it inside out and place it outside for a couple of hours -rrb- also it has loops for a shoulder strap but one is not supplied but overall it is a great deal and a great product
the picture looks much better then the actual product -lrb- color wise -rrb- i do like the feel of the case kinda like cushion , or foam i do hate that its missing a strap , i suggest buying one with your order , to qualify for free shipping it is a nice case , one of those , the more i look at it the more i like it i have to say i did n't think it would fit my mothers laptop but it did quite snuggly to i would most likely buy this product again
i bought this to carry my wacom intuos # wireless tablet out of the office and occasionally for my macbook pro it fits perfect , although the tablet is a little too thin for the case , i just leave the foam packing from shipping inside and everything fits nice and snug the only complaint i have is the smell others like it , but for me -lrb- and i do love chemical smells -rrb- , it 's overwhelming i keep the sleeve about # feet away from my desk and it 's still strong when i travel , this will definitely have to go in the trunk until it completely <unk> other than that , sturdy <unk> , great looks and perfect for my needs
i have a # `` macbook with a hard shell case -lrb- a speck one -rrb- , and this sleeve just fits it it is very snug otherwise , it is a very cute sleeve and i love it
i liked the <unk> of the case and i was worried it wouldnt fit my lap top i have a dell inspiron # r and it fits perfectly my only complaint is like some one said before it really is a neon orange color not a tan like it looks in the picture so it really looks more <unk> because of the bright orange all in all its a nice case good quality i gave it # stars cuz of the color not being accurate other then that its a keeper
great price on a decent case , certainly worth the money i guess it could have a bit more padding , but for general protection and not <unk> drops , these cases are great
i got this to protect my # . # `` laptop from scratches while it 's in my backpack , so the `` <unk> `` aspect of it was n't a factor for me it might protect from minor bumps , but that 's it it fits my size laptop well and looks just like the photo provided it came to me with a bad chemical smell that was unbearable i turned it inside out and washed it on delicate in an old pillow case , and the smell has lessened
item is very pretty and fit my # . # `` dell xps laptop it has the metal loops for what appears to be a possible strap , but no strap came with it it is great if all you are taking is the laptop , but if you need to take other items -lrb- i.e . wireless mouse , power cord etc . -rrb- you will need a different case
i bought this case for my teen daughter to use for her school-issued netbook it fits perfectly on her # & # # ; netbook with enough extra room to also store her charger in the case
this sleeve was just beautiful i was scared when i read a review that the colors were fluorescent but that was not the case at all they are vibrant and very pretty its in perfect condition and fits my macbook pro # . # perfectly -lrb- no case -rrb- the only thing about it is that it did come with an awful chemical smell i read about that in the other reviews but they recommended i air it out its smelling better now and i 've only had it above the ac for today i would really recommend this sleeve
it came in a nice timely manner , fits my # . # inch laptop perfectly -lrb- hard to find cases for that size -rrb- the only downside to this laptop sleeve was that it smelled really bad when i first got it , almost like that brand new smell , but to the extreme after airing it out a lot and spraying it with febreeze for a few days the smell went away overall i 'm very satisfied with this product
i love the case , but i agree with the other reviews saying it needs a strap it 's a cool color , but if i 'm not mistaken the case is grey , black , white , and yellow in the pictures the case that i received had all these colors , except the banana yellow was actually a <unk> orange
i have a # & # # ; toshiba and it fits the width just fine ... have about # / # - # inches of space between zipper and computer when closed since it has loops for strap attachment would appreciate a carry strap
this was a cute and inexpensive sleeve for my studio # dell computer i put on the sleeve , slid it into my backpack and safely carried my laptop on a one week vacation i only gave it # stars because one of the zippers does n't work and i did n't have time # send it back
was looking for a sleeve that would afford some protection and was n't so plain although the background is slightly darker than appears on screen it is still nice looking i do believe they could take a look at the <unk> used to do the print as this product has a terrible smell out of the bag i did a round on ` fluff ' in the dryer with a dryer cloth , sprayed it with room <unk> and then have left the dryer cloth inside it for days seems to be much better so hopefully it will stay that way i was looking for something to fit my sony netbook # . # inch screen this does that just fine
this case is so cool i always get compliments when i go out with it it has enough room for my # `` mac pro and it fits my charger if i need to carry it the only thing i would change is that it does not a have shoulder strap and had to buy one separately , but its no big deal
this is a nice case , however it does have rings that would indicate it has a strap but alas it does not other than that , i think it will be a great protector for my laptop
this case is just cool after i bought it though , i kind of wish it had a strap to carry it with i has the loops on the end to add your own , but it will be an effort to find one that matches it but i really really like it anyways
this sleeve is a nice product to protect my wife 's new # . # `` toshiba laptop , fits snuggly priced right only wished it had a strap to fasten to the strap hooks , seems silly to put hooks on but not to have strap
i have a # . # & # # ; notebook and this cover is a little small all the way around i can squeeze it in there and get it to zip , but i have to <unk> the dongle for my wireless mouse overall good build quality and great selection of styles to choose from just wish it was a little bigger do n't want to jump all the way to the # . # & # # ;
i 've been using this laptop sleeve for my macbook pro for nearly # years yes , it did have a strong smell to it for several weeks , but it disappears completely after a few months if you have the patience for it also , it 's obviously not completely waterproof ; it has <unk> from rain getting in my backpack , and a coffee incident last week has stained the outside otherwise ... it 's worked pretty well for me and my mbp
overall , this is a great case it provides pretty good protection for my ultrabook it had a little bit of a strong odor out of the box but quickly disappeared i am happy that there is a little bit of thickness to the case itself so i am comfortable putting my laptop in my purse or backpack and not feeling like i have to be super cautious with my bag the print is true to the picture and the fact that there are two zippers is awesome it has two loops for a strap so really , the only thing i wish is that i had came with a strap but , i can always add on my own , which i will be doing
this bag came to me looking exactly as i expected , and fits my # . # hp envy laptop perfectly however , the smell was horrible it smells like it was stored in a perfume warehouse which for someone with allergies and <unk> <unk> -lrb- like me -rrb- , is a really unpleasant thing to deal with i will have to let this air out before i can use it other than that , it 's exactly as described and will work for my needs perfectly it even has little metal rings on each side so you could attach a shoulder strap or something to it and carry it that way if you wanted to
i bought this for a late- # # . # `` macbook pro and it fits perfectly , maybe even somewhat tight but not worrying it only fits the laptop though , no space for accessories like the power supply -lrb- but it 's a sleeve , not a bag , so that 's perfect that it fits tightly -rrb- it does have two metal rings to fit a shoulder strap , but no such strap is in the package the padding is okay : it 's think enough to protect it in a bag and carrying it around , but i doubt it offers much protection against a drop the only real problem i have is that it has a really intense chemical smell at first i hope it <unk> in the coming days bottom line : a perfectly fitting , nice looking and thick enough sleeve with an attractive price point
i picked this case because it had a cute design and that 's hard to find for # . # `` laptops most of the choices on the hp website were backpack or <unk> laptop cases , and that was n't what i wanted i got this case for my hp pavilion dv # , and it fits perfectly this is a good basic laptop case that will look cute and most importantly do the job of protecting against scratches and dust in my backpack i gave it # starts because the case has a chemical scent that was kinda annoying , but i 'm pretty sure in a couple of days that smell will fade away if you are looking for a cute feminine laptop case that does the job , then i recommend this one
i like the design of the bag a lot . looks just like in the picture no problems with the color or print however , the bag smelled so terrible that i had to hang it out of my window for # days before it was usable the first night i had it , it smelled so badly that i had to wrap it in a towel and put it in a different room it also will crease and end up with little squished parts however , the padding and the <unk> of the product are awesome . i feel like it will actually protect my computer
i love the pattern my only complaint is there is n't a whole lot of padding for protection i would recommend getting a carrying case to put this in other than the padding , it is awesome
this is a fairly nice computer sleeve except for the lack of a strap there are two eyelets that are obviously for connecting a shoulder strap , but the description tries to present them as an added feature -lrb- i.e . , places to hang stuff -rrb-
i am a college student and i carry my laptop with me everywhere to use throughout the day i needed a new case to carry it in and ordered this one because i was sick of my plain gold one it is amazing i just got mine today and it 's a little big , but i love it that way , and the material is very sturdy there was a smell attached to it - i did n't smell it when i first opened the box , but i did smell it once i unwrapped it from the plastic airing it outside and hoping that will go away , if not , i will just wash it the smell is definitely not a deal breaker , this is amazing
i bought this for my new little asus so i can have a laptop on the <unk> without <unk> my main machine this is perfect for the purpose i bought this pattern so it 's different enough to have some edge to it , but no so exciting that people would want to steal it because it 's a cool bag mine came with a piece of foam <unk> it also so you can have extra padding by just keeping this piece , which i am sure was just mean for shipping
well i guess i will start by saying , all the other reviews were correct this thing has a <unk> oder to it i 'm still working on getting that smell out if not for the smell then i would have given it # stars but i love the design its the tube system in london , if your curious . i bought it for my mac book pro , and so far so good no complaints other than the smell i left it outside with dryer sheets , its still not working , but hoping it will subside someday
it 's different -- that 's what i like about this sleeve and even though it does n't come with a strap , it does have fasteners on either side , so i just removed a purse strap from a bag i was n't using and hooked it to the sleeve a matching strap would be nicer , but for as often as i would actually carry the sleeve outside my briefcase , this will do nicely
i purchased this sleeve after not wanting to pay $ # for an incase sleeve from apple for my macbook pro # `` unibody it 's a little on the big side and is n't quite as padded as the incase but it is great for if you want to just throw it in your backpack or carry it alone it has too hooks on either side of zipper so you could make it into a stand-alone bag with a strap but it does n't come with one the stitching is n't ' the best but it will last a good amount of time it has a lining along the zipper so that you wo n't scratch your laptop while opening and closing the case which is good overall , it 's a decent sleeve and i would recommend it to someone who wants a reasonably priced sleeve with style
this case is great my only complaint is it does n't include a strap to attach to the side hooks for over-the-shoulder carrying , but that 's a minor thing i stole one off my old computer case and it was fine anyway , it 's super cute and fits my # -inch mbp - purchased in feb. # i even have a hard case on it , and it fits inside fine
the sleeve would work just fine for a laptop with a # . # inch screen , but not for the alienware m # x i have an alienware m # x and the sleeve looks like a fat man in a little coat and you have to stretch the zipper to get it to close i might have been better off if i went with a sleeve made for the newer # inch screens
this case is super adorable it 's also a bit large , so it does n't have that nice snug fit that makes me feel really comfortable shoving my netbook into my backpack overall , it 's a functional case and i 've gotten lots of compliments on it
this thing is a dirt magnet , which i should expect with a white laptop cover i have gotten tons of compliments on how cute this was and protective for my laptop
came very quickly and looks just like the picture very cute and nice cushioning it is also designed that there is internal cushioning that protects the computer from the zipper itself
i love my case for my new mac i was worried about getting the outside <unk> , but now that i have this case , i have no worries i received it before my expected date
i really love this product it fits my macbook pro very well when this product arrived it did have a strong smell to it but it has gone away somewhat , the shipping was very fast -lrb- one day shipping -rrb- and i really enjoy the style of the product i do not know if this this product is shock resistant because it does seem kinda flimsy for that but overall i would purchase this again when i need another one
i got this sleeve for my dell computer im kind of a computer guy and i luv this kind of geek sleeves this is the best sleeve i found over the web great design , its attractive and everybody at the university like it
this sleeve is cute and fits my # . # in . laptop very well it 's not too snug or loose it also has places to attach a strap , but it did n't come with a strap the smell was not overwhelming and went away pretty quickly this product is exactly what i wanted for an excellent price
this is a great carry case for large laptops fits a # in . perfectly had a weird smell when i first received it but is now gone as i aired it out for a couple days i think the smell is just from the materials its made of very well made and very cute
gave it to my girlfriend as a random gift and she loved it i was looking for something that would fit her and when i least expected it , i found it
the cover is light but durable enough to handle the weight of my laptop it also helped going through airport security , where as long as i do n't have anything else in the case i can simply put it through ... very convenient similar products were more bulky , although serving the same function
it was beautiful and i love it i would recommend it to anyone i ordered it because of the color and functionality it is what i expected and have used it many times have gotten many compliments
if you are looking for a stylish case , this is it material is heavy duty and can take some punishment , but it also stretches enough to fit a # . # `` laptop as well
this case is super classy and gorgeous the <unk> are bright and the <unk> are dark yep , it smells goes away after a week i like <unk> so i almost kind of had a guilty pleasure inhaling when i brought the case out for that first week more importantly , and why i wrote this review , is that i wanted to say it works great for my # `` sony sa series i will post a picture of my sony inside it ; it is quite snug , but it definitely fits in fact , you can even cram the sheet battery in here too ; a bit of bulging occurs , but it works and -lrb- as far as i have seen -rrb- does n't seem to stretch the case great product , great quality , awesome design
i bought this for my # . # laptop and it fits well , i even have room for the cords i 'm pleased with the case it does have a <unk> smell but it will air out in a day or two it shipped on time and was package well
this laptop sleeve is very thick and feels well put together visually it is very striking the sleeve is very original and i have not noticed anyone else having it i have noticed people have written about it not having handles it has a d ring on each side near the zipper 's end i am sure that one could attach a strap to it if needed very neat product and i am happy with my purchase
bought this for my girlfriends # `` macbook it fits perfectly and she loves the cassette tape design it did have a strong <unk> smell to it but that has faded over the last few days since i gave it to her and now it 's not noticeable unless you stick your nose right up to it it also has metal d-rings so you could probably add a strap to it too
i 'm an art kid in college i needed something cute , but would protect my new # . # `` laptop from pins , food , <unk> not closed all the way , and anything else <unk> to my poor little baby i was a little worried it may not fit , being that i would n't be able to physically put my laptop in before buying but it fits perfectly i 've only had it about a week now but it is serving its purpose its slim enough to put in my backpack , but has just enough padding i 'm not worried it will get scratched i have n't used the d-rings to carry it around being i live in chicago and there are a bunch of <unk> and i do n't want anyone <unk> my <unk> the zippers work great and open enough to easily slip it in and out of the case as for the shipping , i have prime and it got here in the two days it was promised quick and painless
the material is so nice and keeps my laptop protected when i go bashing my backpack around well i 'm rough with handling things no matter how delicate i try to be but it does the job as expected along with this beautiful art piece on top of it makes me feel <unk> even though i 'm not picking the size was easy and if you guess as best as possible it will fit your laptop when you pick the size and you might have a bit of slack here and there but it 's good you can even cram some papers or documents inside with your computer for a quick get away if needed good quality , good design and very reliable i 've had mine for # months now and there is n't a single dent or mark that shows damage
this laptop case is perfect i use it daily and it is still in great condition it looks exactly like it does in the picture and protects my laptop perfectly
fits new macbook pro pretty well , maybe a half inch extra to spare around zipper the print is actually better irl : -rrb- if you want a snug fit , leave the foam in the case
we 've had this for a year and a half , and it is protecting our large laptop superbly it is a fun case and also gets the job done i like that it has two zipper things , so you can zip it either way totally worth it
i was n't expecting the quality of the sleeve i recieved it has a lot more padding than i thought that it would i am very pleased with the quality and the price
i was having trouble finding a case for my # . # & # # ; laptop , but this one fit great everyone liked the cassette tape design the case is n't extremely protective for drops , but it does protect from scratches and small bumps it 's also very easy to clean with a damp cloth -lrb- i spilled coffee all over it on the first day i had it -rrb-
i get compliments on this case all the time i have had it for over a year and it 's still in great condition it keeps my computer safe and is fun to look at the quality for the cost is a bargain this company and product are fabulous
really like my case for the lenovo # . # in laptop i have a y # p for those curious and thought the case would n't fit at first , but give it a few uses and the case is great i had a previous case by digittrade for a macbook in # and still quality on that case as well
i bought the # `` version of this for my new macbook pro # `` -lrb- mid- # model it fits my macbook nice and snug when you zip it up , there are cushion parts on the inside that zip around the edge of your macbook , so the zipper never touches the aluminum it also looks awesome i will definitely be shopping with <unk> in the future
i was expecting something of lower quality for the price i paid for the sleeve , but it 's actually really nice the bird on either side is a nice touch most sleeves i saw for the size of my computer were either really expensive or boring
i have been looking forever for a <unk> laptop sleeve for my # . # `` widescreen laptop all of the ones in stores that i have seen have been plain and boring this one fits great and i love it since i put my laptop in this and then in my bag , i have n't needed to carry it by the d-rings and thus i am not complaining about this sleeve not including a strap . :
this case is really good it is well made and protects your laptop sufficiently i have an mac and i have not had any issues it looks really cool in person as well i have received a lot of compliments it is a cool and functioning case and i would recommend it to anyone
i order this along with a case for my laptop i was worried that the laptop with the case on it was not going to fit it fits perfect and looks great ! i am very happy with my purchase and would buy from this seller again
i got this case for my # in macbook pro purchased in may of # the computer goes into the bag easily even with a shell case on , but it is a snug fit i love the <unk> look ; i have been trying to decide what to write on the blank lines -lrb- it has both an a and b side printed on the case ! the zipper seems to be sturdy so far after about a month of regular use and i have n't noticed any problems with the sleeve
a + + + seller everything perfect , as described just what i had `` hoped `` for and more thank you ! will absolutely use this seller again when possible the appearance and quality are again , as advertised , yet better than i had thought great item . the pattern is versatile for many people ; on my list for gift giving too
this is a very cushion-y soft case it looks great and my wife simply loved it it is sort of stretchy and even fit a laptop slightly too big for the specifications
works well with my big laptop it wo n't save it from a # story drop , but it at least looks cool when i throw my crappy laptop off a building it prevents mild scratches though
the case does have a strong smell -lrb- like plastic -rrb- when you first open it it 's not as bad after a day or two and certainly not a deal breaker it 's not thick cushion-y material -lrb- i was n't expecting it to be -rrb- , it 's the usual padded laptop case if you wanted something for casual travel to keep it safe it 's perfect for that my laptop is # . # `` and fits snuggly into the case , zippering great i also have a bigger battery in my laptop and the case stretches / accommodates it just fine the design is on both sides and it looks exactly like the picture the zippers are nice , not flimsy it does n't have a strap , but there are rings on the sides to attach one if so desired in all i 'm happy with it and would recommend it to my friends
this laptop sleeve looks exactly as pictured , especially the brightness of the colors i specifically mention color because other reviewers seemed upset that the pinks and greens are so bright let me be clear ... they are so bright they are almost neon it looks just like the picture and i love it i have a dell xps # with an extended battery and it fits perfectly in this case and it fits just right when zipped please note that although my laptop is a # inch , i bought the # . # inch sleeve to accommodate the extra thickness of the extended battery i 'm very happy with this purchase and would recommend it to friends
