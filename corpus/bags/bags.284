bought this for my # & # # ; lenovo laptop which fits well in the padded area secured by a velcro strap over top there is also another separated slot where i placed my ipad in its protective shell these two slots are in one zippered pouch in the other zippered pouch , i put chargers , electrical cords , mouse , mouse pad , pens , writing tablet with more room to spare i was very surprised at the amount of space this laptop bag has and it is not bulky or cumbersome in appearance or use i took this bag packed on a motorcycle trip and it took up very little space i 'm glad i searched the internet for awhile to be able to find this great buy
it snaps on very easily and works well in protecting my laptop from damage however it scuffs very easily , giving it the effect that its dirty i have only had this for about # weeks and it 's so cloudy already i liked the see-through aspect of the cover though , since i 'm able to see the decal i bought underneath the <unk> , however , takes away from the decal
the product came in sooner then expected and it looked exactly the same as the picture but , when i inspected the case closer i noticed deep scratches that could not be rubbed off -- thinking it was residue from the protective film i was going to return it but decided to put a sticker over the scratch , instant fix aside from that negative the product is good , it fits perfectly on my macbook pro
i looked at several hard cases and nothing caught my eye i even returned some cases because they did not look classic i have finally found the one
i love the case and it was a great value for the money - but - there are two tabs on the front bottom that are under the wrist when typing and can be uncomfortable my husband has a speck brand case and it does not have any protrusion over the front edge that said , he paid like $ # for his speck case so
the item was perfect , just what my daughter wanted the color was very nice and the keyboard cover really does protect the keyboard the price is what really sold us for both
purchased this case for my daughter 's new macbook pro # `` looked around quite a bit and this was the best deal for the case + keyboard cover received the case and it was a snap to install my daughter is very happy with the case to protect her new macbook pro
great buy for the price i love the color of the case it 's what i expected people <unk> and admire if you want an attractive case and low price ... this is the one to get
i did received and it did n't meet my expectation ... there were cracks ... would not order again i was so mad that i had spent more than $ # just to receive something like that
i was looking for a case that fit my macbook pro nice and snug and this did n't it 's a very nice case overall , but not what i was looking for also had an <unk> indentation that i presume would have gone away with time but not sure since i returned it
i bought this to replace my old black incase neoprene sleeve for my # in macbook when it arrived , there were several creases in the outside gray shell of the case that have never disappeared -lrb- i have had the sleeve for # years now -rrb- the stitching on the inside was also a lot <unk> than the case i had purchased back in # however , this case has held up well over the last two years i use it to carry my laptop around in a backpack most of the time
this case is not as rigid as i wanted it to be but it is still very nice it fits snuggly around my # inch mac book pro i do like how it looks
i have been using this for several weeks now and find it to be exactly what i wanted and paid for very nice padding and colors for a decent price - well worth it
very high quality case much better price on here versus buying it though apple the padding is a bit <unk> than many other cases on the market , and the lining is very plush <unk> provide superior protection for your investment also , the zipper has recessed teeth to prevent scratches - nice touch
this thing is like a pillow <unk> for my computer combined with a little common sense it will go a long way to protecting your backpack on the go it is the perfect size for the # & # # ; macbook pro , and slides right in and out i love the thing and use it every time the mac leaves the house
this case is perfect for carrying my macbook pro the material is nice and thick - offers good protection for a soft shell case it does not have a separate pocket for a charger , which is n't really a big deal for longer trips where i need the charger , this sleeve fits nicely in a larger bag with a power cord
when i received my case , half of it was broken i emailed top case , told them i received a broken case , and they sent a new one . # stars for service i travel a lot . because of constantly moving my laptop from my desk to my purse , the bottom snapped in half only buy if you dont plan on moving your laptop from place to place
if you want a sturdy case do n't order this it 's <unk> thin and i would n't really trust this case to protect my computer from anything other than scratches and dents that 's all i bought it for but buyer beware
bought this for my mac air # & # # ; this cover is a beautiful color and i had no complaints the first # months got a lot of compliments on it after the # rd month the securing tabs on the sides began to crack and break off i am still using the case but disappointed that it has not held up real well the price is pretty accurate as far as <unk> of the product
the cover is very very frosted , the advertised picture makes it seem like you can see the apple logo when the light is not shining this is not true , you can see it when the apple light is on but it makes the logo look very slightly fuzzy still love this case though , the color is
this case is really cute the problem is the case gets dirty easily it does ' t look nice on the outside i would still recommend it for those <unk> who like this color
this case has kept my laptop safe the color is accurately displayed in the picture and feels nice the only thing is that it 'll crack very easily - but it 'll keep your macbook safe
the product was deliver very quickly i loved the color i was a little worried that the color might not be what i wanted but it was perfect the only part i 'm not happy with is the bottom part of the case because it does n't attach in the back corners but its not really a problem unless you touch them the case fits the computer i was also very happy to receive a keyboard cover of the exact color the apple does shine when its on . it has a soft feel to it i think for the price and quality of it its a good buy
the color of this case is true to the picture it snapped on very easily and does a fantastic job of protecting mycomputer from scratches at only eleven dollars , this is a great buy , especially considering the price apple sells a very similar case
this case for my macbook pro # in is great it keeps my laptop clean and safe color is awesome and the case slid right on so happy i bought it
loved it , i read the reviews about how some did n't fit & get dirty easily . but no i have a mac pro & love mine ! fits great looks great & is true to color
this case looks and feels slick but it does not fit the macbook perfectly and it cracked a bit around the edges the first time i was putting it on
i truly love the color and the case itself a bit disappointing because the case keeps cracking at the corners i have bought a second one in # months for the price , it is acceptable
great case for macs i 've purchased four of them for my college age kids in a variety of beautiful colors they all love them they fit perfectly , are not bulky , and the texture is great , enhancing the grip while carrying and reducing the <unk> of the mac sliding off their <unk> the apple glows through perfectly one son wanted this bold orange , and it is gorgeous the older son wanted the black , and it is very classy <unk> wanted the purple , and it is soft and feminine so far all are very durable and we are all happy
i adore this case it has been on my computer for a year and has protected it well , vents the hot air properly and fits amazingly i would highly recommend this case i also purchased the orange keyboard protector and it is amazing the difference ! ! ! i would suggest to buy them both together ! ! ! !
i used an online guide to make a thule case like this one even more protective by adding memory foam and fabric to make it a snug fit to find it google `` <unk> # <unk>
this is a great product it is durable , but small and compact it fits my ipad and macbook with no problems it can carry my cables and they can be <unk>
i realized that spending $ # for a computer and then buying a cheap , poorly padded case was foolish this thule case is waterproof and will take more shock than any other case i 've seen all in all , a wise and necessary purchase i was traveling recently and my macbook was knocked off a desk i was lucky that it landed flat and did not on edge i <unk> that i would upgrade to a <unk> case and the thule met all my requirements for protecting my computer i recommend this case to everyone
this case does not fit my macbook air # . # & # # ; laptop correctly it is too large , slips up when laptop is open , is flimsy and weighs about the same as the actual laptop i would not suggest buying this product on the good side , it makes the laptop appear as maybe a notebook , which is helpful with safety issues and its cover is smooth and attractive
i have had this cover for about # months now , the elastic that holds the top corners is now stretched out often slips off was n't super expensive but wish it would have held up better
i ordered this because it looked like a great product , and at a great price too got it quick with the # -day shipping , and it fits like a glove it 's got that great leathery feel and it gets # starts in my book
bought this case/cover for my wife 's macbook air the build quality is amazing and it really protects the laptop from dings and scratches the case has a solid feel to it and a good grip so that we can carry the laptop in it and feel confident when holding it i wish they had a # . # `` version of this too .
had some <unk> on the sides , had to return it back gap on left and right side is too big , pelican should redesign this box . it is good looking adding a couple side clips would do the trick
the top and bottom do not join together to form a seal because of this the case does not do what it is advertised to do it needs side latches to complete the seal
i use pelican cases for my <unk> and hoped this would work for my laptop it does not - the design is poor as it does not have any clasps on the sides this means the sides do not seal even when the case is empty
should have read prior reviews of this product this case does not perform as advertised ; does not seal on the corners and the one piece latch design is inferior do n't waste your money on this product
i received my pelican # case in the mail today , and i promptly removed the case from the packaging , and put it in the bathtub for a couple minutes upon opening the case , i found that it was very wet inside this case is worthless , and will <unk> you into a false sense of security with its claims of being water tight it 's obvious that the plastic is bowed on the sides of the case preventing it from sealing properly avoid this at all costs
this looks like a good case , and i really wanted to make it work but i noticed the lack of a seal , and decided to test things out i closed it up with nothing inside and put it in two inches of water in my bathtub i held it there for maybe # seconds , and then pulled it out after drying it thoroughly , i opened it up and there was water leaking in from the back hinge area i bought this specifically after watching the pelican video of the # case that stood up to being <unk> in a swimming pool i returned it the same day i bought it
the one i received in the mail had gaps on each side where water could get in the seller was great and accepted the return i had the opportunity to look at several more in a brick and mortar retailer and i saw many with this same problem so if you get a case like this , utilize it for shock protection and not for water protection
poorly built , flimsy , cheap , bulky , low grade plastics and <unk> , not dust or water proof at all thoroughly disappointed in a company i thought <unk> themselves on quality would n't recommend to anyone
by the time i removed all the foam to fit my dell <unk> laptop there is almost no protection the inner dimensions mentioned with the product do not include the foam
the review says this is for # `` laptops , but it will fit the new macbook pro retina # `` model if you get rid of the ring of foam however , then you wo n't have any side padding , so just buy a cheap roll of adhesive weather <unk> or glue some felt padding in you 'll see what i mean when you look at it this wo n't fit the ac adapter , just the laptop itself however , it 's small enough to fit in an average size backpack , and i feel pretty comfortable traveling with it in this case one bad thing , the included strap was missing one of the plastic clips , so i had to buy a different strap not a huge deal , but inconvenient
the case is very solid and i do not doubt it will protect my computer during transportation i bought it to be crush proof , so i do not mind that is is n't <unk> for my # inch laptop
this case seems solid and durable it is indeed waterproof despite the apparent space between the two halves the rubber seal still seals all the way around as others have said , the closure mechanism is a terrible idea and pelican should be embarrassed all of that foam padding and hard plastic will count for nothing when the <unk> snags on a piece of clothing and opens with minimal force , sending your computer crashing to the concrete
everyone hates the latch , and i would tend to agree that it does not inspire the greatest confidence i did not attach the strap , opting instead to pack the case into a backpack i wish that the case would & # # ; stand & # # ; on any of the edges , like a book the only secure way to park it is flat , which is not always convenient for the way that i am working i am using the case to hold my # & # # ; macbook air as others have noted , there is a gap when the foam is <unk> to store the mac , but that 's okay because i use the additional gap to store my small wacom intuos # drawing tablet so , if you have a macbook air and a small wacom , this will work great -- of course you wo n't have room in the case for any cables or other items those will have to go into the backpack that i 'd encourage you to get so that you wo n't have to worry about the latch popping open
i bought this for my clumsy wives macbook pro the peace of mind literally makes this product pay for itself solid product , well made , and i did not experience any of the issues previous reviewers had i must have been lucky the foam is <unk> to cut or punch out by hand fits # in macbook pro ! ! the foam is not like the foam in my pelican gun cases its made of a cube <unk> material so its really easy to work with when i bought this i thought i was going to have to use an electric knife -lrb- like the kind you use for <unk> -rrb-
i live on the island of <unk> and sometimes i need to take my macbook air with me it rains a lot here and this pelican case will keep my laptop dry when i walk to and from my car also this product is the pick and pluck style foam which can be custom built to handle the # & # # ; macbook air one final note , this product will fit into the rack pan of a # and keep your laptop from being damaged
i 've seen alot of reviews that this was such a horrible case and people were upset that their pelican case did n't live up to the cases that they 've had in the past having used other pelican cases throughout my military career , i have seen pelican cases fall off of the back of <unk> and keep on going i love them is this case just as tough however , this is n't a couple hundred dollar case so i was n't expecting to be for the money , i think this case is an great value i would buy another one i have no doubt this case will protect my laptop as i throw it in my rucksack and head overseas once again
i travel a lot and i never have to worry about my laptop not working when i get somewhere or when i return i 've lost # laptops to plane <unk> dropping my carry as they try to cram there oversized luggage into the overhead compartments no more worries with this case
i have used pelican products before and when i got my new macbook i wanted something to protect it i saw this on amazon and thought ok a little pricey but it looks good the delivery was fast and the product well what can i say it surpasses my expectations there is no regret in my mind for getting this case . lightweight , secure , easy to <unk> for you 're items if i had to buy a case right now id buy this one . i dropped this and it bounced down the stairs not a scratch on my macbook
this is really great for my macbook pro # ' it fit together unfortunately there 's no room to put the charger in : -lrb- anyway is still great , i 've hit this case with the wall , floor , <unk> and car everything 's fine , my macbook is still work . :
i purchased this for my ultrabook laptop protects my laptop even after an accidental drop test have n't encountered any rainy / wet conditions , but it appears to be up for the challenge
i use it for my tablet i am a musician and i use my tablet on gigs this case has been great for protecting my gear i highly recommend it
these are fine , i have had # , this is a great color however the reason i have had # is because the corner at the bottom back left or right side will break off after a few months , i dont know why
love the color and that it is grippy , my mac was always sliding around only down side is if i am using it on my lap i have to remove the bottom because my mac gets way to hot good product , good looking and very useable
i like it it does what it 's supposed to , but it does seem like my mbp gets a little hot . other than that , the laptop is kept safe , and i 'm happy for that
so , i have had this case on my computer for less than a day , but so far i really like it it snaps on nicely , it does n't add a million inches to the size of my computer , and it looks pretty smooth i just wish there was more than black or orange for colors of # `` cases
i have received so many awesome compliments from people about the cover for my # & # # ; macbook pro it truly is an amazing buy and has a great color to go with it
this cover is garbage it falls right off and will not stay on your macbook there 's also a little scratch on top of my computer now resulting from the cover slipping all over the place i 'm mad that i wasted money on it
seller was super fast , so i recommend <unk> but this product sucks <unk> balls within the first day , the rubber grips on the bottom came out and i could n't figure out how to get the back in the plastic cover snapped on ok , but i 'm scared to death to take it off as i 'm afraid it 'll scratch my air at least it 's a cute pink color
i really like the color and the apple glows through it very nicely i also have gotten several compliments even from guys the only issue is it wo n't stay on ; it comes loose a lot and i have to <unk> it back on the bottom part stays very well though
i just received my cover and i loveeee the color it 's a perfect pink the only problem was it was a little tough to get on and the one side wo n't click on all the way you really have to force it on but it does stay on and it looks great the price was perfect for what i got
i purchased the khomo crystal pink hard case cover for my new macbook air # `` screen and it fits perfectly it helps protect my investment and is very pretty and eye catching the only bad thing is that the rubbery feet on the bottom do n't tend to stay attached i have owned it for a few months and one of the feet has fallen off the bottom this does n't make my laptop sit crooked or anything , but it would be nice to have the foot there great product for the price
i definitely would buy this for any mac you have i bought one three years ago for my computer and it had kept it looking so great that i had to buy one for my daughter 's new computer
the speck clear glossy cover is the best of the # covers i 've had for my macbook pro it lets you see the great design of the machine , stays on well and allows perfect access to all of the ports the last cover i had was also a speck but it was the matte version and that got sticky after a little while the glossy finish seems like it will avoid the `` peeling `` sticky look the matte one developed i could n't be happier with this product
i had seen this product on a friends macbook and decided to try it on my own # & # # ; macbook it is a perfect fit it has yet to be tested by traveling , but i am optimistic
i had bought a different -lrb- cheaper -rrb- case for my # macbook pro and originally thought i liked it however , i began noticing issues with the fit and sometimes when i picked up my laptop it would pop off i began feeling very nervous that the fit issues would damage the computer after taking that case off and popping this one on i am thrilled it fits perfectly and the clear one still shows the beauty of the macbook i learned my lesson , you get what you pay for , and this is a great case that is well worth spending a little more than the bargain cases i definitely recommend this to anyone
i do not recommend this to my friends , because , there is no ventilation needed at the bottom , where thr lap top gets heated as a result the bottom cover gets <unk>
was looking for an unobtrusive cover for my # & # # ; macbook pro -- just in case i dropped it crystal clear ... the only concern - it does add a tad of <unk> to the mbp making it a little tight to to slide into my briefcase ... otherwise , five stars
this case works perfect for my laptop i was skeptical to buy another one w / my new laptop because the last one i bought through another company did n't fit correctly
i 've used one of these on my laptop for the last # or # years it provides excellent protection from dirt and scratches it works well enough that i 've given # others as gifts to family members it is reasonably thin , makes no real changes in the appearance of the computer , and does not <unk> the use of the machine or any of its ports however , as you may expect it offers no cushioning , so while to protects well against minor dings , scratches , and dirt , it offers no significant protection against greater impacts like a drop i like that this is clear and colorless , as i store a small sheet of paper underneath it with some <unk> key combinations that i sometimes forget , which makes a nice easy reference
although i realize that this is just a sleeve and not an actual case , i still think it 's just a little thin i have purchased other sleeves that offered more protection all in all , though , it 's not a bad product
the size of the sleeve is a bit bigger than # & # # ; even though it said it 's for # & # # ; laptops i guess one ca fit their # & # # ; laptops in this sleeve too the colors are little bit fade -lrb- not as <unk> as shown in the pic -rrb- but i guess it 's ok for the price paid
i bought this backpack for my son because it was wide enough to hold his # ring binders i bought it late january # at staples and now in early april , the # back straps are literally shredding and ready to break the top handle steel cable came disconnected from the backpack his last backpack -lrb- different manufacturer -rrb- lasted # years
the backpack is good i was expecting more construction quality from targus , is not bad but has some careless points on the interior the keys holder hook is <unk> i had to take one from another backpack and attach to it it allows me take and store my keys in a better and faster way on the interior , the bottom is semi rigid so the dimensions of the bottom remains nearly constant it takes a lot of space on your back so if you look for some small backpack this is not for you the advantage is that has a great capacity i chose this for the material top hand handle because i use it a lot on public transportation it seems to be very safe so far
i bought this as a gift for someone who is a lifetime targus user they wanted it because they are now taking public transportation to work and their roll around was too awkward they loved the many compartments to keep things organized since more than their laptop goes in it plus they think the insulation for the laptop itself is great however , they have said the workmanship and quality are not as good as previous targus products and the price is more than they feel it should be
this bag has been through so much , rain , snow , concrete surfaces , and it still holds up like new the pockets as well as overall design make this bag the best one ive ever purchased i recommend for any and all activities
what a difference from the other targus backpack i bought previously it is well designed and laid out , with plenty of useful pockets and plenty of padding , -lrb- apparently something that comes with the `` plus `` <unk> -rrb- it has some stiffness to its structure so while it does n't stand upright on its own , it does n't collapse into a pile either handle on top -lrb- cable <unk> -rrb- is great and <unk> much more comfortable no waist strap but i have n't missed it i use it like a briefcase as well as for travel and it suits those purposes well it 's size is just right , and it will hold a # `` diagonal laptop bottle holders on both sides , water-resistant bottom my fourth backpack in a year and i 'm very happy with it
aside from the fact of the immediate disappointment of opening up the package and seeing the sharp plastic packaging cracked all over , it did n't help when i was also disappointed with the product i thought the product had a matte finish after seeing the black one and the blue one did no , this is a <unk> finish that makes the product look cheap and does n't match the macbook air well some products look better in hand ; i thought this case looked cool in the pics but it just does n't do anything for the aesthetic in person biggest issue , the lid does n't conform well the top piece is not flush and i can push my finger on the middle and hear it <unk> on the macbook the plastic is cheap , on of the tabs came broken off and even the the little rubber feet on the bottom had a yellowish discoloration to them leading me to think my product was used before i received it will be returning for a refund , definitely not worth the near $ # for some plastic
within # weeks of installing this case it cracked around most of the tabs that secure it please save yourself the trouble and get a different case this one is beautiful but is made out of brittle plastic
for some reason i thought this product would have a more rubbery texture it is hard , glossy plastic bottom part of case does not attach very well mine slides all the time perhaps something i am not doing right final complaint is not necessarily about this product , but i have and incase portfolio and the macbook air does not fit in the portfolio when this case is used seems like since they are both made by the same company they should be a bit more compatible all complaints aside the item does what it is supposed to do
i 've received many compliments on this cover for my macbook air the perforated cover allows the computer to keep cool while still maintaining protection the cover panels go on easily , but there is one drawback : sometimes the panels slip off if i grab it at the wrong angle when i take the computer of of my bag this does n't happen often , but i am still careful when moving it around
i get lots of compliments on this case i dropped my computer -lrb- <unk> -rrb- and the case bottom feel off my computer is dented a bit now i suppose the case it not going to save it from a fall it has kept it scratch free though
fits like a glove very happy with this purchase , my mac book air is no longer in my bag with risk of breaking the sleeve seems very durable i 've had it for # weeks now and it 's still
if you have a macbook air # ' # made in # , your macbook air will fit just fine i love the design and it is very durable i highly recommend this product to anybody in need of a good case at the right price
got this case delivered fast . thank you amazon as usual the case is pretty neat and snugly fits my macbook air . you wont get the genuine leather quality but for the price this is surely a good , neat and compact case moreover approx $ # cheaper than what it sells for in apple store
definitely a purchase you will love we have # of these cases for each of the # , # and # in apple computers we use definitely a solid purchase in my opinion
thin , sleek design that i was looking for i bought this for an apple macbook pro it offers great protection and it 's thin design fits the laptop like a glove
not the best quality , but for the price it 's ok ships relatively slow compared to the other things i also ordered but again you get what you pay for overall pretty happy with it i just needed something to protect my computer
the keyboard cover is worth it feels weird at first but then it starts feeling more natural the hard shell case adds extra weight to the laptop the case was fine at first , after a while dirt particles found their way through the gaps on the bottom cover and kind of scratched the bottom of the laptop the top portion of the shell is hard to take off once again , the keyboard cover is worth it but instead of the hardshell i recommend you get a laptop sleeve
i love the computer case , especially the fact that its clear so i can display my sticker however my package took over a month and half to ship it was only suppose to take two to three weeks at max to get to me no , it took over a month and a half i would buy something from this company again , but just be prepared to wait a while for your
the product is what is says it is a clear case , however it doesnt allow the macbook to close completely its close enough but not the same as having no case . overall just an okay product . nothing
this was very cheap so i was expecting something that would n't even fit i have the mid # macbook pro # and it fits yes , it came already a little scratched i did n't like that , but its nothing that compromises <unk> it also will make your mac a little heavier , but i think it 's worth it if it means you get some protection for your computer if you 're looking for something very cheap that does the job , i would recommend it
you definitely get your money 's worth on these products this was only # $ compared to the # $ one at the mac store the best part , there 's no difference in quality , just price i love it
everything about it is ideal for a sleeve , but i purchased it for the # & # # ; macbook air and with slim case on the air it is difficult to slide in and out this could be due to the texture of the case , but it would be ideal if the sleeve was just a little larger just the air no case it is perfect slides in and out easy and does n't have excess movement in the sleeve
