vintage sounded like a lightly worn leather look this backpack had little leather to it and more vinyl -- and it smelled like vinyl too too small for my needs -- but it was and would have been returned anyway
the look of the bag is great , but the smell is nauseating i 've never experienced anything like this ; the bag gives off a strong chemical odor that gives me a headache if i 'm near it too long and it has made me <unk> while riding the bus i kept thinking the smell would fade with time or by airing it out , but it 's still there and it 's unbearable i will contact the company to try and return the bag as i worry i 'm inhaling and touching <unk> residue or some toxic plastic
this backpack is ok i read the reviews before i ordered it , plus the `` small `` picture showed here , and had higher expectations i would say it 's too small for my taste ; and this also goes for the inside pockets where i had trouble placing the computer 's adaptors , remote and stuff the leather looks good , i have to admit i do n't think i would have bought it if i 'd seen it in person before , but i guess it 'll do just for now needed one <unk> so did n't want to spend time returning it
i really like the leather finish and the structure of this backpack it holds my laptop great i had hoped that it would have more space for extras it will hold a few papers and thin items , but not anything thicker all in all it is a strong nice looking sturdy bag
the backpack is lower quality than i expected though in retrospect maybe the quality matches the price i was expecting more the straps are flimsy and not made of leather the interior is less than what i expected though the pack would have been acceptable if the straps did n't look like they would tear off under average use
this bag , while well made and works as advertised is poorly <unk> and the dye runs with any contact with water i had to soak it in the bathtub for a day to get our the dye and then treat it with leather conditioner if it had been on my back when it got a little bit of snow on it , i would have to have bought new clothes
this bag was a gift for a friend and i was a little nervous to buy one in this ones price range but it seems to have come through with flying colors the leather looks nice and it seems to have everything the much pricier bags had
this laptop backpack looks very good and professional very well built is the ideal size for my daily journey thru the subways from busy <unk> <unk> it holds everything i need for a one day trip i bought this because i was looking for something smaller and more sleek looking than my workhorse targus -lrb- which i also love by the way -rrb- love this bag so
nice classy looking leather backpack after daily use for a few months a zipper broke , which is disappointing otherwise its holding up pretty good it 's a little heavy by itself and with a laptop and other stuff it gets really heavy
i like the feel of the backpack holds everything i carry on a daily basis to work -lrb- laptop , umbrella , chargers , etc -rrb- it would be perfect if it had some outside pockets but i can live with that
i was pretty excited about upgrading to a name brand bag but have been disappointed the bag is of excellent quality and has lots of pockets but it is bigger and bulkier than i had expected , yet does n't have the capacity that i had in my previous bag i was planning to carry my laptop , paperwork , and lunch back and forth to work as i did in my smaller bag but because of the dimensions , i have to carry my lunch separately it is also stiff which makes it hard to get on and off my shoulders i am hoping with age that it will stretch to accommodate my lunch bag and be more flexible
this was a gift purchase and met all expectations practical and professional fit a # inch laptop with extended number keypad -lrb- slightly snug -rrb- if you have a larger laptop might want to consider something bigger
overall happy with this bag decent space , leather is nice , zippers work well , and i personally like the blue lining drawbacks : not tsa checkpoint friendly , buckles feel cheap , and does n't quite have enough padding on bottom of laptop compartment with no secondary <unk> was worth the money if you accept the above going in
love the pack , may compliments only issue is the straps start to tear after # mo to a year . . because i carry with one strap over my shoulder returned one and the second on is ripping as well just needs a better re-enforced stitch at this location i 'll eventually take to a sewing shop i ca n't zip with my larger # & # # ; laptop in it
seems like great quality for the price many compartments to choose from , as well i would have to disagree with the woman who said it was too large for her i am # ' # `` , # pounds , and it seems just right for me anything smaller would lose its purpose -lrb- to hold a laptop and other large <unk> -rrb- ; and anything too much larger would have been <unk> so , i find the size to be just right on my petite frame
i bought this bag over three years ago , and have carried it practically every day since it has flown countless times , including overseas it has served as my only carry-on on two and three day trips it has held up beautifully , even when i <unk> overload it the zippers are <unk> , and so , even though i have loaded it to the point where the zipper separates , all it takes is unzipping and <unk> to <unk> it i have flung it in the backs of cars , <unk> , <unk> , trains , subways , planes , boats ... and it holds up well and even looks better as it wears i clean it once or twice a year with saddle soap , and the leather keeps getting softer and more flexible the computer compartment wo n't hold a very large laptop , but it holds a # `` one just fine , and is padded enough to protect it in the overhead bin all in all , it has been a far better , longer lasting , more useful investment than bags costing five times as much ... and i still get compliments on it , fairly regularly
everything fits , straps are comfortable , and there are plenty of little pockets for all my various items the leather is good quality and i have had no problems with the construction of the bag it holds all this and still fits under the seat on an airplane exactly what i was after
i bought this for my daughter for christmas she is a first year med student and she wanted something a little more sophisticated then her college backpack and also something more convenient then her leather book bag which i also found here on amazon thank you again amazon very beautifully made
this fits into my life well holds everything i need and is great looking leather <unk> is still one of my best purchases and it has been several years now this bag has held up through rain and abuse to still look and perform well i am <unk> because i may buy another for a friend i have a smaller baggallini purse i can put in this bag for work with my essentials , then take out to use when i do n't need to carry all the other stuff such a good combo a working woman 's solution for having what you need when you need it
i bought this backpack based upon the reviews and have been very pleased with it the straps are nice and padded and have plenty of room for adjustment the pockets are numerous and i have always been able to fit my laptop , notepad , magazines and other accessories in it without a squeeze the construction inside and out is high quality and i have had o issues after using this for over # months and traveling through airports once a month -lrb- where it gets thrown around a bit -rrb- would definitely recommend to others a nice unisex backpack for men or women who want something less geeky than the usual bags , but not another handbag
this is my second bag from solo - the first a computer briefcase vintage collection in <unk> leather , this one a computer backpack in the same material both bags are of superb quality , and perfect for toting my # . # `` macbook pro and various power supplies , hd 's etc . the computer compartment fits my macbook pro which has a <unk> bags sleeve very snugly , and plenty of other compartments highly recommend this bag
so far it seems way better than anything i 'd buy at a sports store and the best day pack i 've bought to date leather feels like good quality i 'm considering buying another one a steal at $ #
i purchased this bag for a trip to mexico and since then also used it for a weekend trip to nyc it has amazing storage capacity and a convenient amount of dividers and pockets the leather is of very high quality especially considering its very affordable price the zippers and straps also seem very durable could n't be more pleased with my purchase
i like it color is not that bright and its pure leather , inside are all cushioned for computer , also lot of space for folders and large front pockets are easy
the following `` cons `` are my personal <unk> rather than real problems # zippers seem not much reliable # too many sections as for me they are quite small if there is a model with only # sections -lrb- one large and the other one for a laptop -rrb- , plus , external pocket i would definitely choose that one top handle looks too <unk> else is ok straps are soft and adjustable laptop section holds # `` one easily internal pockets are usable nice <unk> for those who are looking for a `` business backpack `` to carry a laptop , papers and small belongings
this is an excellent quality bag the leather is very nice in appearance and sturdy after i received mine i used a leather cleaner and conditioner then a leather water repellant to protect this investment after having used it for six months on a daily basis it looks just as new as when i bought it the zipper action is smooth and they are holding up well do n't let the turquoise color of the interior talk you out of this bag or you will have missed out not only on a bargain but on a very nice backpack i 'm pleased with my purchase and highly recommend it
and i do n't usually write reviews , but this bag deserves one traveling for business a lot , i often overfill this bag -- laptop , documents , kindle , some snacks for the plane etc -- i haul it over my shoulders , put it down at times not so gently , and yet it is just as strong today as when i got it # years ago the straps are <unk> attached , the bag looks good and is comfortable as a backpack
this backpack looks good enough to bring to a client 's office - and it 's functional , holding all my necessary items obviously , it 's got a laptop pocket , space for files , readers , headphones , and cords it 's got a nice , slim profile so you wo n't be hitting people as your turn i highly recommend this for those looking for a backpack good enough for business travel
believe the reviews this is a great backpack <unk> to everything said and i wanted to add that the blue interior is much more muted than the pictures show it must 've picked up the light quite a bit when they took the pictures because it is blue , but not that blue so do n't worry the brown and blue together really looks sharp and it really does make it easier to see inside the bag than a dark interior would have yes , guys , it really is a nice bag for you too do n't hesitate buy it now if you have been looking at it hurry before you miss this price
i love this bag pure quality leather , solid stitching , comfortable , plenty of room and will last me many years i do agree with one other review , the interior liner color is a bit ugly , but who cares , you really do n't see it anyway overall , i love this bag , no regrets
my husband has two offices and was weary of carrying a heavy briefcase everywhere he went he wanted a nice , professional backpack to use instead and this one exceeded his expectations made of soft leather , it contains enough compartments that he can stay organized on the go , this backpack is perfect for his work needs it is deep enough for all his needs , and even has space for a laptop , yet it is compact enough to tote everywhere he needs to be highly recommend this product
i looked everywhere and tried so many leather book bags this one is the best ! it is not only a beautiful leather bag , but it has the perfect amount of compartments , padding for electronics and has awesome padded straps which is a must and hugs your back very comfortably it 's hard to find a leather bag that looks this great and fits like a sports bag awesome ! -lrb- i recommend spraying with a water protector
i am very pleased with this purchase the product is well made , and has a professional look and feel about it i would recommend this to my friends love the smell of the leather shopped around and got the best price on amazon solo vintage collection <unk> leather laptop backpack , holds notebook computer up to # . # inches , <unk> , <unk>
my high school student got this at the beginning of the year and it still looks perfect # months later i was hesitant about the price but paid in hopes of it lasting a long time i have not been disappointed , nor is my child their other canvas backpack lasted # years , so , if we get # out of this i 'd be happy it looks like it will last at least that long it 's a durable , quality product they throw , drag and bank it around and it still looks great i would certainly buy again
this solo leather laptop backpack is fantastic looks great and the leather is high quality comfort of wearing this item is unsurpassed by any i have tried before the interior lining makes it easy to slip laptop in and out of the backpack lots of storage this is a quality backpack and at a low price compared to other web sites highly recommend this item
i rarely write reviews and i 'm quite difficult to please the solo vintage collection backpack , however , is a superior product and worthy of my time to critique the first day i carried the pack to work , one of my employees said `` good morning , nice backpack . leather usually adds an <unk> look of quality and craftsmanship to most products there are also very few leather backpacks available for purchase the number of compartments and the thickness of the straps make this backpack one of the best that i have seen or owned some reviewers do n't like the interior color - to each his own i think the color is fine and of little <unk> when you consider the quality of the product
i 'll admit , i just got this yesterday and transferred all my stuff from my old bulky targus backpack this has to be the best packpack i 've ever had my old backpack was a pain , but i 'll take this one everywhere now , not just to work it 's like a purse , but very manly so much room in this bag and my dell fits perfectly -lrb- # inch -rrb-
i really love this backpack the leather is thick and beautifully finished the interior is lined with a light blue material that makes it easier to find objects inside arm straps are thickly padded and comfortable i use an oversized laptop -lrb- # & # # ; diagonal case -rrb- which just barely fits inside the laptop section if they had a larger version i would buy it too laptop section does not allow you to fold it out for separate scanning by security
i got this bag as a gift for my boyfriend he wanted something easy for traveling since he spends quiet a bit of time traveling for work he wanted something easy to carry through the airport and through security so far he absolutely loves the bag he said it is very good quality , has a great vintage look , it is comfortable to carry , and all compartments are easily accessible i looked around for a while but i am glad i ended up choosing this bag and you ca n't beat the price , <unk> 's sells the same bag for $ # ! !
i am a female in my # 's and i was looking for a nice backpack to haul my computer around i love this backpack it has more storage spaces then you can imagine , its great for women it can cary so much i could do with a different color of interior material but it 's not a deal breaker by any means its very functional , and it looks good too i would definatly recommend it
we read a lot of reviews on leather back packs and decided on this one my son really wanted a leather pack , most of the reviews said the straps gave out with much weight , so he is being mindful to not overload it it is very nice looking and has the perfect compartment for his laptop
i really did n't want a backpack that looked like something a kid would carry this is an awesome leather backpack that is very functional plenty of storage but does n't look like one large zipper wrapped in nylon
got this at christmas for my husband it looks to be very well made and i hope time proves that to be true this is the most classy backpack to be found at a decent price it does not look like you borrowed a <unk> backpack
it was delivered promptly , is well made and my daughter has been toting it all over campus she loves it when my second daughter starts college next year , i plan to get her one as well
i 've purchased two of these so far - one for my husband , and one for a young man going into college my husband has had his for # years now and it still looks great and that 's saying something because he beats the hell out of most of his things but the matte finish seems to really withstand the abuse and apparently it is very well sewn because he has not managed to rip anything on it yet the size is perfect too - not too big or small and the blue lining looks gorgeous - at least to me both <unk> love them and use them everyday definitely worth the money
i 've been looking for a nice backpack to replace my shoulder laptop bag for a while and this delivered the leather looks nice the style is not too <unk> , which was what i was seeing with all the other options i 've only had it for a short time , but it seems to be wearing quite well the straps are very comfortable considering my computer weighs a ton my laptop is # . # inches and fits very snugly in the correct compartment still have room for all my other gadgets and some paperwork in the other pockets i would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a <unk> alternative to carrying their laptop on their shoulder
this bag is ideal i have been looking for a professional style back pack for many years and just found it it fits my computer perfectly , it is not heavy in weight , and sits on the shoulder nicely really is a great bag
i have this one for more than two years and it 's almost daily used now it looks even better than new the laptop compartment has plenty room for my # `` laptop and other papers if one packs very efficiently , the main compartment has sufficient room for a business outfit if one <unk> it sufficiently -lrb- including the zippers -rrb- , then one can ride with it even through heavy rain without having to fear any water damages
excellent quality ... however , i believe the description should say , the back of the backpack and the straps are not leather nor is the inside ... only the sides and front outside but even so , it 's very well made my husband loved it and if he loves it , then all is well in the world
i looked around for a backpack for a long time i 'm <unk> and carrying multiple bags was becoming a hazard i 'm very impressed with this backpack it 's very well made , the leather is beautiful this bag will last a lifetime my computer fits in this bag fine even though it 's larger than # . # i 'm surprised that the price was so low
this solo vintage collection leather backpack is lovely it is made of very sturdy leather with exceedingly great detail and construction i highly recommend it the seller was prompt and product was better than described i love the color and am ordering another for one of my children
this backpack can <unk> to some serious abuse i 've had my backpack for about three months now and it looks like the day i got it i use it everyday and carry it from class to class with it <unk> packed with books , notebooks , calculator , and my # `` hp laptop the laptop compartment is plenty big enough and its also well padded for protection all the seams are stiched with <unk> thread and all the stress points are riveted the craftsmanship is top of the line solo must have a really good quality <unk> department after i finish school i plan on using it to carry around my it tools
great buy , i like this backpack great quality and all around great backpack i would buy again and again i only have a # ' screen laptop which easily fits but i am sure it wil hold a # ' just as easy great space for papers pens business cards or what ever you carry in your briefcase you will not be disappointed <unk> this backpack , i carry it with me everywhere
as a professional , i have always preferred a backpack over a briefcase or shoulder bag because a backpack is easier to carry a greater weight my problem was that i have always been very embarrassed carrying around a canvas bag with business clothes this leather backpack looks nice enough that i can get away with it it is very well made , very sturdy , and stands up by itself it has a great , roomy laptop computer compartment and enough other compartments to separate items without being overly complicated very easy to access whatever you want my only complaint -lrb- very minor -rrb- is that i wish the interior was some other color besides <unk> -lrb- dark green would have been better -rrb- other than that , a perfect , great looking , well made backpack and highly recommended
another reviewer claimed this bag is n't for women -- i disagree i 'm about the same size as she described -lrb- # ' # `` , # lbs -rrb- and i do n't have any problems with this bag it 's sturdy , has lots of room and compartments i 'm always looking for the perfect backpack and this is it i find it to be very well-designed plus i love the brown leather exterior and the truly beautiful blue interior lining it 's not a <unk> backpack , but i was n't looking for <unk> -- i wanted something that looked good and could carry all the stuff i lug around with me every day i 'm very , very happy with this backpack
this backpack is stylish , beautiful and crazy roomy there is a compartment for everything i fit my # `` macbook pro with room to spare in the laptop compartment in back , my textbooks , notebooks , chords , mouse , etc . love this bag buy it ! !
this bag has very good quality and it 's sized perfectly for everyday use - not too big , not too small the leather is strong , supple and remains good looking , even after an accidental encounter with rain i have used it everyday for the last # weeks it still looks brand new the hardware and zippers are of good quality and have given me no indication of trouble i did a fair amount of research and found this item to be very <unk> priced i would buy it again no issues with the vendor
i love this backpack it holds my laptop a large notebook and various other stuff the leather is heavy duty yet soft i would but it again in a heartbeat but probably will never need to
this is a well made bag , and nicely designed i bought it for my nikon d # and large # `` laptop however , it does n't fit either very well it would work fine for a # `` laptop and smaller dslr if i put the laptop in it 's a real squeeze to get the zipper closed the camera compartment is pretty tight for my d # , a compact zoom , and an additional # mm prime lens no room for a flash , etc . you have to go to storing things in the top compartment , and there 's <unk> padding there for those sensitive items
made well and looks great carried a d # , <unk> # mm , # mm and # mm , charger , filters , batteries , headphones and # `` laptop to the uk fit in the overhead of a <unk> rj weighed a ton with that gear and the waist strap was useless so the bag was very uncomfortable when loaded up unloading everything but essential camera gear it was acceptable , though not comfortable for a days worth of walking and shooting
this is a great backpack for my purpose i have a nikon d # , # mm , # mm and # mm f # . # prime lens , sb- # and a # `` notebook and all fits perfectly in the bag i also throw my memory cards , batteries , trigger system in the smaller compartments and even put a # `` collapsible reflector in the notebook section when i am not carrying the notebook the bag itself is light yet durable , which is great when i have to carry all the above mentioned equipment only <unk> is that i wish it had better organizing compartments for the camera batteries and memory cards and other smaller necessities i also got caught in a small burst of rain and the bag seemed to hold up nicely in the rain , even before i put on the rain cover that 's included see my photos at : -lsb- ...
this has become my carry-on bag for all international travel -- it fits my camera equipment , a laptop and the stuff i need in transit -lrb- toiletries , snacks , magazines , ipod , an extra sweater -rrb- it 's great for trekking -lrb- ergonomically balanced while hiking -rrb- and attractive enough for carrying around cities the camera section in the bottom is a bit snug and requires some wrestling to get the camera out when it 's tightly packed , but that 's my only complaint fits neatly under an airline seat yet big enough to stuff with everything i need while travelling
i have really liked so many aspects of this pack holds all my things in a well padded setup it holds # lenses , body , flash rain cover in the bottom , grip stuff , flash accessories and laptop power source in the top part and computer in the back area gripes : bottom area is just a tad tight another # `` or so would have allowed camera body -lrb- eos # d -rrb- fit without arm wrestling it into the bag the top bag would have <unk> greatly from a zippered pouches that are transparent to hold batteries and other accessories , every other camera bag i have has some of these instead the pack has , deep pockets accessible on the front of the top portion of the pack , which are okay but not as organized as i 'd like
i needed a backpack type bag for a trip i just took to kenya this bag allowed me to pack my macbook , canon xti , lenses and assorted accessories and gave me room for a few personal items for the flights to and from the camera compartment is easily accessible and protected my gear wonderfully i did n't feel like i was fumbling around for stuff while i was in country it made the trip a lot easier for hobbyist 's this is an outstanding backpack pros with large lenses will need something bigger
for sure this bag worth much more than the price the quality is very good among similar products the curve is a bit flat and does not fit to the shape of one 's back very comfortably will be perfect if , more side pockets , pocket on should belts , and bigger upper room if you do n't need to carry a laptop constantly i suggest the new kata # in # <unk> model , it 's almost perfect
kata really does make an excellent bag and this is no exception the big question to ask yourself when getting this bag versus others is obviously , ` will i like the way i 'm accessing my camera ? ' to be honest , the lower access zipper pocket ended up annoying me since i was always having to hug my bag backwards or set the bag down to access the camera this is n't a grab your camera , take some shots , and toss it back in kind of bag if you keep the camera in the top section you can kind of pull this off , but there are definitely other bags more ergonomically designed for this type of use outside of that , the partitions and pockets in this bag are great there is plenty of space for gear and the laptop section is great if you need to carry a lot of your gear and can have your camera out most of the time , i highly recommend this bag but if you need both your hands quite often , well , you might fight the ergonomics take a little getting used to
got the bag and it met all my <unk> for it -lrb- this is my first camera bag -rrb- the slots for camera are great the extra pockets for little gadgets are well design and very useful the straps and the back support are well constructed i also love the notebook slot the only thing that throw me off right now is after i bought a # mm lens ca n't fit it with my camera inside i guess this was design for travelling and not for storing well , got a shoulder bag for my lenses and it still working great
we purchased this bag to carry my wife 's nikon d # and her dell # ` laptop so far it has served its purpose well she puts her camera with lens attached in it and there is room to carry # more lenses there is also a compartment for books , tablets , etc .
i bought this bag about # years ago and still use it it is a very durable bag ; i 've stuffed it too it 's max capacity when i got sent to afghanistan i use it with a # inc mac book pro and a nikon d # w/ # - # <unk> lens and they fit perfect there 's still room for extra accessories but not that many it is a great bag to use when traveling as it can fit underneath the seat and you do n't have to put it in the overhead compartment which gives me relief knowing its easily accessible during flight my only complaint is that it does n't have a compartment for a good sized tripod and that is essential when i go out and shoot ... ... beyond that it 's very handy ! !
this bag is much bigger than i had anticipated it 's bulkier than i had hoped for although on the flip side i can easily fit a nikon d # and nikon f # with # lenses and an sb # flash unit with plenty of room to spare for extra batteries , filters , <unk> , and a laptop
i really do love this bag ... the yellow inside makes it easy to find everything fits comfortably on my shoulders and despite tons of equipment works well on a <unk> female frame it holds my dslr , # lenses , a flash and still has more room available the only reason i did not give it # stars was because the water bottle holder is really too small to carry anything i would have rather had another pocket for memory cards or something
i have owned mine for around # years - great for carrying my nikon gear ; from a daily trip to work to <unk> the zippers are now shot , but i 'm sure it is due to <unk> ordering another one today
the bag is very durable and sturdy i 'm really surprised how nice it is , considering the price it is larger than i thought it would be -lrb- almost too large -rrb- , but it accommodates everything you 'd need for a <unk> photo walk or hike the shoulder straps could be more <unk> they work the way they are , its just that they are fairly basic as far as how they are shaped and the way they wrap around you i would recommend this bag to friends , and would consider kata for my next bag if i needed something else
having a dedicated camera backpack seems like a luxury but if you are shooting a lot it is definitely worth having this backpack easily carries my laptop in the back zipper pocket and a camera -lrb- with a lens attached -rrb- , # lenses and an external flash in the front zipper compartment there is more room in the top for odds and ends i have also been able to have it hold small and large tripods using the side straps the padded straps are nice the only downside is that i would not be comfortable carrying this bag where i was concerned about theft as the camera is easily accessible when it is being worn
this very useful bag got really good reviews and i needed a sturdy bag for my camera , equipment and laptop and this works extremely well lots of storage space for <unk> good padding to protect equipment and enough space to fit in some extras when i 'll be out for # days very comfortable as well i would put around # lbs of equipment in the bag and the straps evenly distribute the weight to minimize <unk> on my <unk> along with the lowepro flipside # this bag is all i need for a day out shooting
i really love this purchase it easily takes in my rebel xsi plus the # lenses -lrb- including the longer # lens -rrb- additionally , it accomodates all my accessories , chargers and my smaller camcorder then you have the additonal storage compartment and te laptop <unk> this is an amazing backpack and extremely comfy too
i purchased this backpack to hold my nikon d # it is perfect for my d # + # <unk> lens there are a lot of more spaces to hold more lens and accessories the notebook holder is huge which is able to put in a # `` laptop i like it very much because i do not need to bring one more bag when i am traveling only thing you need to worry about is the room for bigger lens i never try a big lens like nikkor # f # . # in this bag and am not sure if the room is enough overall it is a very good camera case for traveling and hiking
this backpack worked great i took it on a trip to chicago it is a good backpack for a carry-on it fit underneath the seat in front of me and it protected my camera the rain cover was essential walking <unk> distances in heavy rain i put in my d # , # mm <unk> , # mm , sb- # flash and a compact camera still had room left in camera compartment the top compartment is a little small , but ca n't argue with quality of the bag for the price paid it was pretty comfortable too
i have had this bag for # weeks , and have taken it with me everyday to carry my d # nikon , sb # flash , etc . what i like most about the bag is the large open space above , great space very well built love it and very highly recommend it
this bag can fit my nikon d # with # attached , # mm , # . # mm , <unk> # and sb- # flash that does n't even take into account the top pocket , the small pockets or the laptop pocket i do n't travel with a laptop , but magazines , maps and books fit perfectly the top pocket holds my ipod , large headphones , pens , small notebook , etc . the water bottle pocket is garbage , but who cares
so far this is the best bag i have found that will allow me to carry as much dslr gear as i do and still hold a laptop , ipad , and random other stuff i 'm not happy about the size of the main compartment , but i 'm impossible to please it hold what i need it to which is more than i actually need to carry making the main compartment any bigger would take away photo gear storage space or make the bag <unk> hugs you mount a tripod on the side too this has been my main bag for a year now which is longer than most . recommended for those who ca n't decide which lens to bring
i saw a colleague 's and i had to have one for myself his had the black handle i thought mine would have red inside to match the red trim on the handle but it was yellow i have a camera body , # lenses , a flash , and lots of batteries with the recharger you can configure the velcro separators to fit your needs i still have room for another lens so now i will order a wide angle to complete my kit the padded rear will hold a # `` laptop and your favorite photography book easily and there are plenty of pockets for personal items i like the idea of eliminating the need to carry a purse and a camera case everything i want to carry will fit in this for a day out
this is the best camera bag i have found there is more than enough room for my camera , two lenses and and assortment of filters the pull out mesh holder on the side of the bag is a little small to store the tri-pod but works great for a <unk> my toshiba laptop fits well in the rear compartment and the top <unk> area still provides a good amount of storage this bag wears comfortably and has been providing functionality while we have been touring europe
great pack for work and shooting i love being able to fit my # `` macbook pro in there along with my still camera it 's on the small side , but a very <unk> pack not good for larger lenses as i doubt they would fit the main inside pocket on the top is just that , a pocket there are some litte storage areas inside , but nothing crazy . front pockets are small , and hard to get into at times but great for manuals and keys straps are strong as well water bottle holder seems to be useless as it is small i really dig this pack
i am a dslr <unk> , and purchased this bag for my canon xs -lrb- canon <unk> # mm is lens + tamron # mm <unk> <unk> macro lens -rrb- there is plenty of room for the camera , lenses , my <unk> <unk> camcorder and a ton over other stuff i plan on leaving my laptop at work or home when traveling , so i will have even more storage for tickets , documentation , magazines and whatever else i can fit in i will not bother describing the many other features of this product , since they have been well <unk> in ratings from others this bag is perfect for my needs
i love this bag i needed a bag that would carry my camera gear and my laptop , but also still had room for other personal items this has been the perfect solution when i am traveling it holds my camera body and attached lens , # additional lenses , my flash , my laptop and my personal items if i am going on a shoot and i do n't require personal stuff , i can fit an extra camera body and # lenses i also like that i can attach a tripod to the outside the construction is great and it includes a <unk> cover the only real downside is that you are limited in height if you are traveling with a big zoom it will not fit in the bag my bag also came with a free monopod , which was a great extra
i have used this bag on several international trips and found it to be an excellent bag , it is a good design and offers great protection to my cameras and gear
excellent pockets for additional items material is quality and light , however , the manufacturer should consider a stronger zipper i have one that was purchased a while back and i was not too careful when zipping up this time , i am much more careful as i want this one to last a bit longer
this is a great briefcase i really want to buy another , but it appears they are no longer sold : -lrb- i really want another , so please contact me if anyone knows where i can find one
this is the first laptop computer case i 've had that also doubles as a briefcase for some files and a book or two it 's a perfect fit for my # `` macbook pro and offers it maximum protection it also has an abundance of <unk> pockets for accessories like ipods , ac adapter , etc , as well a pockets for pens and pencils and a place to secure one 's keys i 'm thoroughly satisfied with this well thought-out briefcase and the quality of its construction
after using this bag for # trip , i discovered that the handle does not always extend properly , so you fight with it also the handle bends too easily when it is extended and makes it hard to <unk> the bag very disappointed in this bag
the bag is fine , but the handle is pure junk it bends and bows , and quickly became non-functional and stuck in the extended position while i was boarding a plane there are better choices than this
similar to the other solo rolling briefcase i ordered , it is not leather in fact , it is quite misleading to advertise it as such after returning the first bag , i decided to keep this one it is a very functional bag which i use everyday while functional , it does n't hold up like leather would and is n't as attractive
i fly quite often for business and was looking for a well made roller bag for my laptop the bag itself is great as i love the side zipper access to the laptop and the additional room for misc items , however i am very disappointed as it does not fit well under the seat on the plane
the size is right for airplane overhead storage or under the seat for its weight it is not especially roomy to contain articles for a long flight durability is its strong suit as well as attractiveness
i bought this for my brother in law for his business trips the removal of the laptop out the side makes it very convenient for air travelling it 's the perfect size for a couple of nights clothing is held securely with elastic straps it has a pocket on the front to hold folders and papers , with a smaller one for pens , pda , etc . it fits easily under an airplane seat very convenient and it looks good too
i bought this for my boyfriend for his business trips it 's the perfect size for # or # nights clothing is held securely with elastic straps , so it does n't shift and get wrinkled there is a pocket on the front to hold folders and papers , with a smaller one for pens , pda , etc . it fits easily under an airplane seat , and allows for the removal of the laptop out the side there 's even a spot for a power supply built into the handle assembly it 's perfect
this is a great case , but i do n't like the dome feature basically , it is a # in . circle of foam that is thicker in the middle , located in the middle of the case supposedly it is designed to protect your laptop display from pushing against the keyboard in fact , it seems to me to do the exact opposite their idea of physics and mine are quite different i saw this in staples and decided to order <unk> # instead if it were n't for the dome , this is probably the one i would have ordered in general , i like targus cases
i have a # inch acer aspire and the case will accommodate it under it 's & # # ; dome & # # ; protector the moveable padding on one end would be good for both larger and smaller laptops additionally , the manufacturers included a very handy case with mesh on one side so that you can both store and see the various cables and connectors that one <unk> accumulates with a laptop inspection in an airport is very simple yet the dome works somewhat against you in that you 're left with up to three inches of dead space on top of your laptop when using it , i put my microsoft surface tablet and book on top and secure the whole thing with the included stretch strap yet even with that , the rest of the case has limited value for storing anything else of value or bulk if you have more than an external optical drive , you 'll be challenged as to where to put them it 's a good idea , but it could be better with all of that it is very rugged and probably ideal for the <unk> laptop user
ok , yes , it 's roomy , and has no problem fitting a # `` laptop with the power brick and a mouse in the main compartment there are plenty of pockets and pouches for accessories and cables , and it seems to be well built ... except for the `` dome `` . it comes loose and floats around between two layers of the case material if i could figure out how to remove it without damaging the bag i would
