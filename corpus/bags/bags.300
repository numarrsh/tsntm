this case is exactly as pictured my macbook air -lrb- # in -rrb- fits perfectly inside i was able to put the adapter in the outside pocket although it was a little tight fitting great price for a protective padded cover for my new computer
this case is a perfect sleeve case in terms of fit , comfort , and style however , it has a lot of fibers that need to be cleaned out before using it other than wiping it , the case is great
i already have a designated laptop pocket in my backpack , so this sleeve was great for that extra bit of protection for the price it is made of quality material , and the inside is soft and <unk> if it was a bit thicker it would have easily gotten # stars , but at the same time it is sleek and fits the # & # # ; retina macbook pro with a snug and secure fit would definitely recommend but it is not for someone looking for a heavy duty protective case
i use this with my # & # # ; macbook pro in a non-padded backpack it is a perfect fit i would n't recommend its use with a retina pro , though the fit was very loose
the case is everything i was looking for , however , the quality of it is not meant for someone who is constantly taking their macbook <unk> pro in and out of the case i say this because the velcro has already begun to tear away from the pouch , and the edges around the opening of the pouch are already beginning to fray , and i 've only had the case since october the price is great , but the quality means you 'll probably buy one -lrb- at least if you 're like me -rrb- every year i will probably buy an identical one , once this one calls it quits :
the retina macbook pro fits a little loose inside the sleeve , i expected it to be a bit more snug i use the ipad part of the sleeve to store the power adapter which helps keep things <unk> the slim design allows the sleeve to slide nicely in and out of my backpack the padding on the sleeve could be a little thicker , but it protects from the usual wear and tear of scratches and small bumps worth the buy , whenever it becomes <unk> again
item is not specifically designed for mbp # `` with retina screen but for any # `` notebook so the fit is slightly loose , but it is an effective dust and scratch sleeve no padding , but i find that the new mbp is so thin that i can leave the foam packing sheet that came as part of the packaging inside along with the computer , so that affords some padding <unk> short edge flap with <unk> corners means no zipper to bump or scratch extra pocket will hold apple 's usb superdrive or similar slim <unk> peripheral , or an <unk> notepad -lrb- for people who still remember such ancient technology -rrb- there is a band of fabric piping around the edge as a kind of <unk> towards shock protection , but it is probably there just to cover the seam if your <unk> is specifically sized for the newest machine , this piping edge may make sliding in and out a little snug in these cases it 's best to be patient , caring , and pay attention to your breathing
this case is nicely protective and very sleek to use for my retina mac book pro i doubt i 'll ever use the ipad section though since my ipad will not fit in it with the folio case i like to use love the color
i was looking to use this with the bags that i have i have found i do n't usually bring both laptop and a tablet but if i do it does a good job
my boss told me to get a sleeve , that it makes all the difference for those of us who haul our laptops all over the world , all the time this sleeve is awesome works perfectly -lrb- i have a dell xps # and an ipad # -rrb- appearance & feel are great no zipper , and top opening makes it very easy to pull the laptop out from my backpack without any fuss goes right through airport security -lrb- no need to remove laptop -rrb- note that with the xps & ipad both loaded it may be too heavy for the <unk> pocket on a flight -lrb- the pocket will sag toward your knees -rrb- the ipad pocket works well for accessories -lrb- cables , mouse , travel docs , etc -rrb- seems quite durable i rarely write reviews , but this is pretty much perfect and a great value
i can keep my macbook pro retina and ipad with smart cover inside it comfortably it is also fitting the mbp retina perfectly , not like other models that have been designed for the regular mbp and sold as `` retina compatible `` , ending up being loose
it 's a sleek design and covers all of the laptop the only design flaw is that when inserting the laptop , a second flap must be pulled around the corner of the laptop before <unk> it closed
the extra pocket for ipad is great although it can be a little tight with both devices in there the sleeve does a great job protecting the computers the only down side is that after use of several months , some part of the fabrics start to fall off on the front this might be due to the friction but still a great product for the money
i was n't looking for a heavy-duty case , but simply a sleeve to protect my mac from abrasions and scrapes as well as something to keep it in when i carry it in my backpack bottom line : it does what it 's supposed to for a great price i put my # in retina in the large sleeve and the charger , headphones , and any other accessories in the front pocket
i love this laptop sleeve i purchased it for my macbook and it fits perfectly it has a front pocket for additional cables , a mouse , your ipad , etc . it 's thick and soft , so it protects nicely it 's a nice color , not too bright
i purchased this case looking for a stylish yet cheap alternative to the cases at the apple store after i recently bought a new # `` macbook air the case fits well , although there is about half a centimeter of sliding room on the side of the macbook sleeve velcro is solid and feels good when attached ; i do n't worry about it coming undone the neoprene is comfortable , does n't feel cheap , and will protect your device in a bag , but definitely not from a drop i liked that both openings have a small strip of neoprene that folds over your device , which helps secure them in their sleeves case is simple and straightforward , and like previous reviews , smells strongly industrial when first opened , although that goes away -lrb- i did n't mind at all as it stays in my backpack half the time -rrb- tested it out with an ipad inside as well and feels really good , would definitely throw both devices in there and into my backpack when heading out as i do n't have an ipad of my own , i use the smaller sleeve for papers , cords , pens , and other random <unk> which is quite useful overall , i would recommend this case because you really ca n't beat the price -lrb- i got mine for $ # -rrb- , and it does exactly what it advertises clean and simple looking , this beats all the cases at the apple store if all you need is simple protection while on the go
i was looking for something that would be slim and easy enough to use with my mbp # `` retina display i have a case on my mbp and this sleeve fits it perfectly i think , if i did n't have the case on , it would fit a little big the ipad pocket is -lrb- obviously -rrb- a bit big for my ipad mini , but it also holds the mini 's <unk> pen , plus a small car charger very stylish , convenient , and the color is perfect slightly more pink than the original photo , which i thought was more purple , but i like the color better in person it 's cushioned enough to protect , but not bulky
i was looking for a case that i could fit my macbook air and ipad into and this was it i have the kuzy rubber hard case on my macbook air and the original leather front cover on my ipad and they both still fit in this case i then carry it in my messenger bag and it fits in there nicely too , not too bulky
for years i carried a compact laptop bag for my computer problem = i travel a lot i was pulling it in and out all the time and because of the luggage restrictions , my laptop bag was always in some other carry on when i found out the laptop could stay in the sleeve through security i was all over this and i have been glad ever since now i do n't have to carry to whole bag and can slip this into my backpack or carryon when i go through security i do n't have to worry about my computer getting bumped or scratched it 's just a great solution for something that was such a hassle to me i also love that it has a small picket on the front so i can occasionally slip papers in there and what not would be even better if it had an ipad mini sleeve , but no complaints
finding a case to hold my ipad as well as my macbook was surprising to me i do n't think it would do much protection if you ever dropped it , buy i think it 's more of a carrying case to begin with it feels good , but it does have a strong odor that goes away after a while i would n't immediately use it everything fits inside it well and it feels extremely secure i recommend this sleeve
fits my macbook and covers it completely , my ipad mini fits in there good as well . i dont use it as often as i thought but its nice to have protection for your expensive products
this sleeve is a perfect match for the macbook air it 's light and thin it has an extra pocket , which is useful if you 're an apple fan -lrb- like i am -rrb- and also have an ipad
great product - i have purchased several of these for my family - all have consistently good construction - great time and space saver in my brief case to keep mbp and ipad together and safe i personally use the # & # # ; and # & # # ; products - highly recommend velcro closure is very secure - nothing is coming out unless you want it out good thickness - not too bulky , but good basic protection i would not drop your mbp to concrete but it keeps it safe from most solid bumps and all scratches as of this writing my oldest copy is # mos . old and it still looks and works great
this product fulfills my need both the macbook air and the ipad have al bodies that are easy to scratch even when transporting inside a laptop bag -lrb- because of other items : cables , mice , power adapters , etc -rrb- the neoprene sleeve is compact -lrb- not too padded -rrb- and light , just to save my machines from scratches
i had a slightly bulkier case before and just needed something slim to tote my macbook air in , this did the trick and was able to fit my kindle in the extra
i recently bought an apple macbook air and decided i wanted a sleeve what drew me to this product apart from the delicious color were comments that suggested this sleeve offered a snug fit i 'd borrowed a friend 's macbook pro and the case it came in was <unk> suitable for a # `` computer but the # `` was swimming in it i knew my # `` macbook air would not be happy in such a case i 'm every pleased with the neoprene sleeve case whose color is closer to magenta than pink , but the photo on the website <unk> that it holds the computer in a nice grip and fits perfectly in the backpack i also bought for the price , this sleeve is a steal if i ever decide to add an ipad to my collection of apple products the sleeve has a second slot for that
this product is nice and fits my computer perfectly i have bought things in the past from other sellers and the product was never what it was supposed to be the great part is that it has a lot of padding . : o
this sleeve case was perfect it fits my # ' apple macbook pro amazingly now i do n't have to worry about my macbook getting scratched theres also a compartment for an ipad which i also use and is amazing i can now fit both of my devices and bring it anywhere knowing that its going to be scratch proof i bought this product because i needed something to protect my mac from getting scratched when left in my backpack however , if you are planning on buying this for other reasons then i recommend a different type of case i also love how the inside has this lime green color which makes it so much more attractive to look at
i bought this for my # inch samsung series # -lrb- an ultrabook -rrb- it does n't quite fit , but my computer is different dimensions that most # in computers , and this is closer than the first one i bought -lrb- built for # . # & # # ; laptops i like that the opening is on the end , so i can pull out my computer without taking the whole case out of my backpack i use the pocket for my power cord , mouse , etc .
i have a macbook air # inch and ipad # , both with cases and it fits like a shielded glove tight and form fitting some people have made minor complaints about the velcro vs. zipper , <unk> a zipper case enjoy that case my friends i have <unk> and wasted lots of $ on ` protection ' , and i could not care less if anyone <unk> the velcro of my case opening i love this thing and would recommend it for anyone that just recently purchased a macbook air or has one already
i love how the case looks and feels it 's a perfect fit and for the macbook air # model do be warned that there 's a little opening on the top two corners , so if you want a lot of protection , this might be a problem the reason is because it uses a kind of <unk> method to close the case i love it though
this sleeve/case fits my mac air like a glove i originally bought this item to be able to put my mac inside my book bag when i travel and not have to worry about the aluminum getting scratched up i also got it because it had <unk> that was big enough for an ipad or another similar sized tablet i have a galaxy note # and of course it 's not meant for a tablet that small but it still works and it kept them bundled together nicely however my tablet now has its own separate case so i use the extra space for my portable laptop fan it fits them all together nicely and is n't too bulky i also have my mac in a hard shell case of its own and if fits perfectly still ; so if you wanted to put an extra case for more protection it would still fit in this sleeve i am very happy with this product the only thing that could make it better would be a place for my to put my charger as well but i can not make any complaints about it other than that i recommend this to anyone with a mac air
i use this product with my mid # macbook pro with an incase hard shell attached and it fits like a dream i feel as though the laptop is incredibly protected and stylish as well
precisely what i expected of the product provides good protection against scratches and minor protection against bumps -lrb- it 's neoprene -rrb- the reviews for several other similar sleeves mention a chemical smell - this does n't have any such smell the only downside i 've found is the velcro kicked off some of the hooks the first couple of times i opened and closed it , but that seems to have stopped
i have a cover for my air already but discovered it is slippery this sleeve fits right over the covered laptop and not only looks attractive but also adds protection and gives me a firm grip very reasonable price for the quality the velcro is noisy but it is velcro i like the extra pocket which i use for my accessories
not sure what the complaints are about it holds the laptop snuggly and protects it when i travel with it additionally , my ipad has a thin case on it , and there 's still room to put it in the ipad pouch i 've only had it a couple months , but i like it very much so far
i 'm using this with the oct # version of the retina macbook pro -lrb- # & # # ; model -rrb- the side pocket is snug - probably good for an ipad mini or some extra cables great sleeve , just what i was looking for probably not going to do much if you drop it , but great for protection inside a bigger bag
i bought this for my new apple laptop and i ordered the right one according to what they put into their <unk> i would not order from them again
i have this case and a speck case for two # & # # ; mbps i 've had the speck case for several years now , and no damage has occurred to it -lrb- or the mbp -rrb- unfortunately , i can not say the same for the ec technology case the two computers are stored in the same area , exposed to the same children , and basically get the same wear and usage , but the corner just under my right wrist somehow cracked and broke off the machine has n't been dropped , and i see no damage underneath , so i can only assume the ec case just , well , broke i 'll be replacing it with a speck case as soon as possible
i suppose when you purchase something on super sale , you get what you pay for however , truth in advertising is always appreciated my `` rubberized `` case is most definitely just cheap plastic and the small slip guards on the bottom are basically held on with hopes and <unk> ca n't imagine this is going to last the day , let alone the school year , so i 'll <unk> to use my laptop
it 's a nice casing but i have mixed feelings about it the top part feels perfectly if you are looking for a good case cover , you better check is the back part of the bottom case clips into place or else the bottom will move around also with that part absent , the bottom back part of my laptop is naked and prone to accidents if are n't careful oh , and they do n't bend like that in the last photo just letting you guys know i would check out <unk> cover cases if your looking for nice case as you can see , they have the back of the bottom case clipping to the laptop i have n't tried them but they definitely seem more protective of your macbook
my item arrived damaged it had two scratches on it and discoloration i tried to return it through ec technology , but they were difficult in getting back to me i eventually had to use amazon to get a refund after writing a review , ec technology contacted me again to resolve the issue
nice finish and fit however , the little rubber & # # ; feet & # # ; came loose within a couple of weeks it was inexpensive , so perhaps that 's not to be surprising -- just a tad disappointing to have to keep gluing the things back
this product was priced really cheap it came to me in three days , my mom had just bought my mac and i wanted to invest in protecting it , but being a college student on a budget i could n't afford much this product fit my mac perfectly and it came with a free matching gel keyboard it is rubberized -lrb- nice feel -rrb- so far i am satisfied
i just received this yesterday and i really like it i ordered the dark blue case and the color is true to the picture it snapped on fairly easily i love the smooth feeling of the case now i can feel better about letting others handle my macbook pro , knowing that little bumps and bruises wo n't effect the exterior of the machine thinking about buying another of a different color for variety , we 'll see though : <unk> i 'd recommend this to anyone looking for a strong cover for their macbook pro
i actually like this product it serves its purpose quite well it does not cost much compared to cases similar to it and it is really pleasing to the eye my only issue is that it collects fingerprints and they are quite visible on the black case
the case is nice but hard to put on because the case itself is quite stiff i could not bend it like it was displayed in the photos overall the case is a bright orange color and protects my macbook well it was a nice fit as well
color : the actual color looks a little more <unk> than the picture fit : i had some trouble with the bottom portion of the case but it eventually fit i feel like whenever i close my mac , i can hear little clicks coming from the case as if theres some loose parts this is a nice cheap case but if you want something that is completely snug and perfect , go for the more expensive ones
i 'm happy with this product the actual color is almost exactly as pictured : a bright , pinky purple i get complements quite frequently on the pretty color i was a bit worried that the rubberized texture would gather dust that is n't true what is does is gather other things , like hand oils or makeup all computers are susceptible to collecting oil , but i found that the texture made it kind of hard to clean most of the time , a paper towel slightly damp with windex will clean my computer , but i had to work a lot harder to clean this case this is not a deal breaker for me , though , and i continue to have positive feelings toward this purchase ... especially for the price
the case came on time and snapped onto my macbook pro easily and securely what i think is its best <unk> is the grippy surface texture , which gives me confidence that the computer wo n't be dropped unless i run in <unk> mode -lrb- when nothing is safe -rrb- i got the lovely <unk> color , though there are many others to choose i wish they made this case for # & # # ; retina models comparing the more slippery hard case i have on that one , i wanted to replace it with this
i first bought a case that did n't fit , was n't see through and darker than the color it showed this case was perfect it fits perfectly the color is what i expected it comes on and off which is hard to find i spent # hours and finally picked this one i am not disappointed also it 's cheap !
this case is wonderful the quality is great for such a great price everything is as described the color is as expected the texture is very smooth and rubbery to the touch it fits nicely onto the macbook
i was at first frustrated with this cover - the bottom to be exact it came off very easily and tonight i have found the the # little clips on the back of it need to be put on # st than snap the other # sides of the bottom on this will keep it from moving or coming off easily like i experienced all weekend while traveling i like the cover a lot and time will tell how it holds up i could buy # of the these covers for the # dollar speck cases at the apple store & best buy
this hard case cover is solid , sturdy , and a bright , fun color that makes my computer easy to find on a crowded , messy desk i 've had it now for about # months and it seems to do the job of protecting my macbook pro
had this for less than a year of heavy air travel use when the main compartment zipper failed otherwise very happy with it but wish the zippers had been better quality and feel that its not a great value for what i paid considering its short useful
the bag exceeded my expectations you are hard pressed to go to walmart or office depot and find any decent laptop bag for # bucks , but this bag is of good construction and quality materials it has more storage than you can see in the picture and plenty of padding to protect your laptop
construction is outstanding , plenty of pockets and room for edc and normal business stuff ... use it to bike commute to work and it keeps my laptop and everything else in great shape
good bag for my laptop so far to bad the army just approved a new uniform pattern but it ok great bag plenty of room to store paper work or what every you need for the
had this for a month now i use it every weekday i 've found it to be very versatile , rugged , & well worth the money the molle on the outside pocket is great
i currently am carrying a sleeve holding a # inch dell , plus a macbook air i carry the chargers for both , i carry # external hard drives , plus a pouch containing usb thumb drives , plus an external mouse for the dell i carry all of this , and still have room for other odds n ends as needed i have not <unk> the velcro or molle yet , but should i ever start to <unk> it 's primary storage potential , there is room for expansion i will see if one day soon , i can put up some kind of video review
super fast shipping ... # days only ... did n't expect that from amazon . usually takes them almost # weeks i like this laptop bag you can use it as shoulder or backpack i tested with bricks inside and the seams and the plastic hooks did n't break for now i ca n't say anything about the quality of the plastic hooks but not a issue when i can change it with a steel overall i 'm glad i got this one i 'll order the <unk>
for a laptop bag there is no padding this bag got an <unk> i have tried to returned it but as of today no response i wants money back for such a heavy laptop why would i trust this bag to hold my expensive laptop
i guess , you get what you pay for i should have know this but contrary to my better judgment went ahead and let price guide me it is horrible wont be using it
i bought this bag to fit my newly purchased alienware m # x r # needless to say from the title , it does not fit the m # x is a behemoth of a laptop i did n't buy this bag to carry around my m # x in rather , i bought this bag to provide extra <unk> for my m # x in the alienware messenger bag , but that 's not happening i just use this bag now to carry the <unk> u # fan dock and other smaller accessories the alien head on the bag looks cool and sports the alienware look , but it does not provide the function of fitting an alienware laptop unless it 's the alienware m # x or m # x
good for a basic basic case i feel for the price its should have a bit more padding like the large logo on the front pro looks cool con cheap feel not enough
my son bought it for me from my wish list it is for # `` laptop , but i like it for my # `` alienware that i just got plenty of room , seems well made will protect my laptop well with gel sides , and provides a little cooling effect on my lap when using laptop
i like this bag , but the hard shell outer case is a dead give away that a tablet is inside also a tight fit if you have a keyboard case for an ipad
very useful # -in- # bag for my every day use i received it in time about # weeks ago and have used it alot before writing this review the breifcase holds a laptop , ipad , cables , mobile phone , papers , pens etc . overall , highly recommend this briefcase , it is an efficient , good quality product for daily long term use
the alpatronix ipad and laptop briefcase has been an excellent solution for carrying both of my essential devices i 've been looking for the ideal bag to carry both my laptop and ipad to work , and i found it i really appreciate that the alpatronix briefcase is made out of quality materials and zippers , things that typically fail on other <unk> that i 've had i only have a few suggestions for alpatronix : the shoulder strap would be a little more comfortable if it was thicker i would like to see space on the outside for pens or a stylus also , it would be great to be able to store two chargers or a charger and a phone easier small complaints aside , the positives far outweigh the negatives and i highly recommend this briefcase
great briefcase - fits ipad , accessories , books , & a laptop if you have that too protects & is light weight & stylish too ! excellent product at a very good price
this case did not fit my mac at all , it said it would but it was to small all the way around , and the color was not as neon as i had hoped
first of all the it does not look anything like the picture pro : protect as stated fits <unk> : this case is not glossy like the picture its more rubberized after having it for a few weeks i 've notice how easily it collects dirt and grease on the cover when installing it on your mac make sure there is no debris between the cover and mac because your aluminum body will get scratch i would n't recommend this product to a friend there 's better covers out there for the price
ordered two mac covers one was black amd one was hot pink was happy <unk> the black but totally disappointed with the pink it wasnt even close to the color more like <unk>
the case itself is n't bad it has a satin finish that can attract a lot of finger prints now , the reason why i 'm rating this item low is because you will break nails trying to get the cover off the top of the computer i did n't have a problem getting off the bottom portion , but i still ca n't get the top cover off
other than the fact that the bottom part scratches the forearms when typing , the steady points on my case detached about # months into using it can not use it anymore
i bought this case in late august and until today it worked just the way i wanted it to , it added protection to my laptop without taking away too much of the slimness and portability however a little over two months later and the front clips which hold the bottom half in place have snapped off ... <unk> the bottom half useless
the cover is made of seemingly durable material , it looks pretty solid and is depicted accurately in the product images all in all the thing is just a case , and it fulfills all its protecting duties very well i do have a few small complaints that i wish i would have considered when i placed my order some people have noted that the case covers pretty close to the usb and thunderbolt connectors and this might be a problem for ` bigger ' connectors i did not see this being an issue until i connected my old power cord through one of the official apple magsafe adaptors it works , but it sits at a funky angle the plastic goes a bit high on the arm rests and is currently cutting into my arms a bit as i write this i 'm going to sand it down a bit with a dremel tool , but seeing as this is a review for an apple accessory , this might not be an option for everyone good case for the price , but i 'm sure there is something better out there
the <unk> of this product was literally a snap it took no time and i was pleased the level of protection is what i was looking for the down side is that it is sharp the plastic hurts my wrists when i am typing
i miss in this dark color was more finger prints friendly and have some problems <unk> usb or <unk> devices -lrb- space problems -rrb- i needed to drill the plastic to make fit all
this will protect the notebook and was very easy to put on those are the pros my teal cover was n't quite as teal as the cover it leans a little more toward blue the edges are also not sanded down very well , leaving it very rough and bothersome on my wrists as i type this i may not be able to last long with this on my computer because of it . : -lrb- otherwise , the product is great so far
the case works great , but the adhesive feet on the bottom fell off within a month or two now i need to find something to replace the feet or buy a new case because it slides around on everything and has almost fallen off desk other than the feet , it 's a good product at a good price
pros : does the job and protects your mbp , frost cover looks nice cons : the case that attaches to the bottom of your macbook make it uncomfortable when you have your <unk> on the laptop
i originally wanted a speck case but those kept taking for ever to be released and i ended up ordering this case it fit well , is protecting my mbp and significantly improves grip it does collect fingerprint a bit more than i would like with the matte finish but overall a very good case for the price
decent product but shows finger prints underneath the shell that will not wipe away , i will probably go with the speck shell whenever it is released but this is a good product overall
i 'm very happy with this case / cover for my macbook pro retina the only problem i have is that it 's a little difficult to connect to an external monitor because the case is a millimeter too high near the ports
two problems with the matte shell case # the rubber feet tend to <unk> rather quickly , i 've had to <unk> back a <unk> ; e of them . # even though shell looks great and i love the matt sheen it has , it shows every smudge and they are difficult to clean off in fact i 've yet to find something that <unk> let me clean off the finger marks functionally , the case is great and i would recommend it highly it fits the rmbp # perfectly and affords some real protection if anyone has a good product to clean it , i would be ecstatic
this macbook cover is exactly what i wanted it covers and protects my macbook pro with retina without <unk> the beauty of the machine snaps on easily , has a nice silky feel and , most importantly , protects perfectly
the case fit perfectly for my # inch macbook pro there are rubber traction pads at the bottom of the case that easily fall off but overall , i am very happy with the case it is very durable and has lasted over two years
so its sunday night , and im going through amazon writing reviews for all my purchased items , and id have to say this case has been just awesome so far i was waiting for the speck matte case to come out but just could n't wait ended up buying the black i-blason case for my new retina , and i love it smooth to the touch , looks sleek , you can still see the apple logo through the case , and there is no <unk> branding on the case . very simple and sleek matte finish over time will show some grease from hands , from normal use , but with a simple wipe from a cloth , <unk> ! gone my friend ended up getting the speck once it came out , quality case , but theres something about the simplicity of the i-blason that i just love would definitely recommend
i 'm glad that i bought this case . i recomend it if you want to save beautiful unibody of ur rd . it protects from scratches , dings and to some extent from heating your lap
i bought this last year for my then new # & # # ; retina macbook pro i liked the easy installation and the fact that the finish was slightly rubbery -lrb- no slip surface -rrb- early this year , i decided to get a more expensive speck see-through hard shell case , partly because of the neat color and their reputation the speck case has a shiny finish and is slippery , and it is definitely thicker , so my macbook pro no longer fits into the neoprene zipper case that i was using i have decided to go back to using the i-blason case so that i can once again use my neoprene zipper case
the viper sleeve # & # # ; -lrb- black -rrb- fits my macbook pro # retina perfectly i use it for added protection inside of another soft case just to ensure solid protection while traveling going through airport security it 's easy out and back into he case i would purchase again , for sure
great sleeve for my # & # # ; macbook air , though it has basically no padding , it seems to serve it 's purpose well still wish it felt like it gave more protection to the device inside super easy to get in and out , the magnetic closure works perfectly
i was hopeful that this handsome case would fit my regular unibody mac , but it did n't this is definitely for an air book very good looking case though i returned mine
its a very nice sleeve and very few sleeves out there matches its <unk> however , this sleeve was made for a mba # , which has a larger foot print than a rmbp # it 'll work for a rmbp # , but its just a hair too big for it
this thing is an incredible companion to my # ' macbook air clever design makes it really quick and easy to get the computer in and out of the sleeve if you 're <unk> like me and find yourself cutting corners as you load up your stuff , this is a huge advantage i was worried that my computer might slip out of the sleeve , but it does n't at all i 've even tested it -lrb- carefully , over my lap -rrb- by flipping it upside down and shaking it by the sides - the computer stays put feels like a flexible hard shell , and has done a good job of protecting my baby so far it also looks really nice , and was stain resistant when i spilled my coffee all over it ca n't recommend it enough
the case looks great and does a fine job of securing the laptop the magnet has no trouble keeping the computer inside and is unbelievably convenient -lrb- as opposed to a zipper -rrb- the ridges add some size , but they seem like nice extra protection , so it 's welcome
the images show a branded sleeve with a warning that without the logo on the sleeve you 're getting a knock off i purchased directly from amazon and got one that has a slightly different opening and no logo anywhere on it it 's not even worth my time to return it but i 'm very unhappy that i got a generic knock off when it was advertised as exactly not that the price was right but the product was n't it does fit a # inch macbook air reasonably well at least
<unk> a great product - and fit the # & # # ; air perfectly - but there were two flaws # -rrb- because the sleeve was sewn along the edges , there was actually less padding there # -rrb- after being out of the package for three days , it was still offgassing so badly that it smelled like a chemical factory
this case has an incredibly strong chemical smell its been outside now for # days and the smell has reduced but not disappeared anyone with smell <unk> or allergies would do well to order another product
