we just use the case for storage at home and for short local trips , but we love it with an adjustable velcro strap inside , we can safely and securely fit our large hp notebook plus there is enough room for the plug the front pockets are helpful , too great for holding the wireless mouse i would feel totally secure taking this laptop case on a longer trip if you are wanting to combine your laptop case with a briefcase , this is n't the bag for you while there is adequate storage for a personal user or a digital <unk> -lrb- like me ! -rrb- there is n't enough room for tons of paper

i bought this laptop carrying case partly on the recommendation of another amazon customer and i was not dissapointed the case is sturdy , well padded , has great pockets for accessories and the shoulder strap is very comfortable the only thing i might have added to the design would be a horizontal velcro strap to hold the laptop in place in transit

i bought this bag for my new hp # . # inch laptop most bags i checked out online would not fit this size even if they claimed to fit # inch screen laptops this one is great the bag is light enough but also feels safe enough for carrying around a laptop my # . # inch laptop fits easily and there is even a little space left on the sides so it could probably handle an even larger laptop i think this product in unbeatable for this price

i bought this laptop case for my asus rog g # <unk> # laptop computer i was skeptic but i checked the dimensions # times before i bought it i am amazed that everything fits perfectly it in if you have seen the asus rog laptops they are huge the screen may be # inches but the rest of it definitely is n't so i was happy when it fit snug , even the gigantic power adapter and my <unk> # mouse i could n't have picked a better case even if i went to best buy or staples with the laptop in hand and tested each one i <unk> out definitely recommend this case
this is a beautiful laptop case that has velcro fasteners to hold a # . # inch laptop perfectly in the main compartment and the ac adapter on the side the front compartment has plenty of room for your mouse , mouse pad , any extras , and even several cd/dvd holders the price was right too - i researched it and found that brick and mortar local stores had flimsy cases for higher prices case logic products are top of the line
i bought this bag for my hp g # `` notebook it fits <unk> the fit and finish of this product is very nice too . you ca n't go wrong for the money
i wanted more than an <unk> with capacity to also hold cd/dvds , a mouse , power cords , my external hard drive , paperwork , etc . for such a thin case , it does accomodate everything beautifully

i have n't used the case yet but will be using it next month on our vacation but i am very pleased with the case it has a lot of room for my accessories and it opens up so you can use your laptop while it is still sitting in the case my laptop is a # inch but i ordered a # inch case because the # inch case would not give enough room to store the cords next to the laptop in the main compartment the # inch case is perfect for my # inch laptop the price was very good and the vendor shipped quickly i received the case in less than a week
this is just a terrible rolling case the laptop is secured by velcro flaps in the back and are definately not secure the pockets are minimal and basically you can only fit in one or two thin folders the <unk> for electronic devices is <unk> because who really has a cell phone that small this is a horrible item and i was happy to return it
i was mildly disappointed with the weight and bulkiness of this case admittedly , it is well padded and very protective of its contents , has a lot of room i bought it because i had surgery and carrying my laptop and accessories was a problem now i find that the wheels alone do n't make up for its weight however , i do n't have the experience to compare this to other rolling cases , just carry bags
i wanted a rolling laptop carry case to store my laptop in along with a few other computer products when i received the case , i was thrilled to see how many pockets and how much storage room there is in it the wide distribution of the wheels is true to its purpose preventing the bag from tipping from one side to the other while transporting it 's basically what i asked for with a few extra surprises the price is reasonable for this product the only one i have is that it was a tiny bit larger than what i was expecting it still rocks
the case logic # `` laptop roller case has held up very well to normal business use which most times does not include carrying a laptop the number of sections and pockets for holding various accessories such as pens , calculator , markers , and files are plentiful and well placed i would have preferred slightly more space for holding files , but i am nitpicking at this point the handle works well and the wheels roll true a recommended buy for the office worker on the go
i just got mine , i had it shipped from the us to ph . ... very nice , durable and you can organize a lot of stuffs in it . very happy with the product
this product seems to be holding up fine its holds a lot of items so its easy to make it to heavy . but it fits my needs of a bag that will fit my laptop when i need it in a meeting sometimes
this is great laptop bag it has a lot of storage and fits my # `` envy great the build quality also very high and seems like it will last a while
i 've been using this case for several months now to carry my hp envy # to work daily , and i love it it 's relatively lightweight -lrb- i 'm glad i did n't buy the same item in leather -rrb- and spacious , with enough padding to provide needed protection it comes with lots of zippered and divided compartments for folders , back-up charger , etc , and is well made and sturdy yet good looking could n't be more pleased
this was the perfect bag for my husband to carry his computer , files , etc . to work everyday this bag holds alot of stuff ! ! it is very durable , it looks professional and i would recommend it
this is a great travel case it 's sturdy and protects the player but using the strap system to attach to <unk> and seats is a pain getting it hooked up so it 's sturdy and level takes a long time i understand the strap system is nice because it 's so versatile for different cars , but it 's not a quick and easy setup to hook this up
its all right except i fear that the zippers will & # # ; <unk> out & # # ; on me prematurely its too bad there is no more decent work <unk> anymore we the consumer are pretty much screwed as to finding anything of quality
i bought my son a sony dvp-fx # `` dvd this case works fine as a case but its other feature as a mount leaves a lot to be desired it consists of a series of straps you run around the seat and headrest it is a real <unk> to install and remove i would look elsewhere if you need a case to act as a mount if you just need a case , it is fine
this is a very nice case , it was just more then what i needed it will be good to use whenever we have kids and can set it up for them to watch dvd in back seat
bag is good quality but strapping system could use some changes having to just sit it on something flat in the vehicle which can get in the way at times
when you install it in the car make sure you take the dvd 's out of the other side first trying to get them while it is between the seats is <unk> to say the least but it does protect the dvd player well so no major issues
i bought this to go with the sony # inch dvd player i bought on amazon it 's decent enough and fairly rugged however there is little room for anything else the power cord for the player had to be stuffed in which bulged the case our a bit i guess they made it a little too compact
this unit has more than enough bells and whistles , but all i wanted was a dvd player carrier case for that purpose , it more than meets the criteria , but is also more than a bit bulky yes , bulk <unk> to padding and protection but i was not about to toss this off a <unk> train or anything if you are looking for a thick , well padded dvd player case , then this is the case for you if you want something smaller , go with something else this is a seriously padded <unk>
i bought this for my daughter for a sony <unk> # -inch portable dvd players and is very convenient for all the accessories as well as her dvds it seems sturdy to be durable and light to be moved around comfortably it did arrive before the scheduled timing ...
i would have given # stars , however an important fact needs to be noted the case is molded on only one side the other side is soft case having the impact protection on both sides would have been ideal to fix this error , the user could get a paper sized hard plastic sheet and place it in the large zippered back pocket to improve impact resistance on that side of the case other than that , the case appears well made
this case replaces a case that originally came with our portable dvd player for the car that case was poorly made and the straps tore off within a year of first use this case has heavy duty stitching at the buckles and several straps to be able to attach it in a variety of ways
i chose to rate this product less than # starts -lrb- love it -rrb- because i received what i asked for and it looks to be very sturdy just have not used it yet ... so # stars seemed a bit high
easy to pack , holds the sony , the charger and a few disks i also like the light weight and is much easier to carry around than <unk> leather cases
we bought this for when we take our # year old granddaughter to the beach with us -lrb- a # hour drive -rrb- the sides are hard and nice and sturdy the extra compartment makes it easy to take five discs with you but not much else the straps for hooking it to the seat are just really long straps so you have to get creative to get it to hold the movie player in a functional position we have n't been able to <unk> this yet so i just hold the player for her i realize that they are trying to make the straps useable for many different situations and automobiles but they just do n't work for us that being said we are glad we made the purchase because we can transport the player and discs compactly with good assurance they will not be broken
