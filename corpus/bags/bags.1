initially i rated this product four stars , but now i wish i could give it one . these headphones provide dull sound compared to sony , and they create a scratchy noise when plugged in brand new my sony earphones are way better
we had our previous samsonite briefcase for almost # years before the latch would n't close any longer we purchased this samsonite -lrb- mfg # # -rrb- and within the first year , the inner compartments came <unk> now papers and documents slip out the back of the case the latch freezes and the case wo n't <unk> times unless we jiggle and mess with it this briefcase is awful and i am so sorry we purchased it it is complete junk compared to our previous case which lasted two <unk> where has quality workmanship gone
i had a previous version of this briefcase and i still use it and love it unfortunately , they redesigned the latches and this briefcase , when full , will pop open easily since , i carry tools and instruments , this is unacceptable ever and especially at airports i am very disappointed with this product
i received this as a gift to replace my # year old samsonite opened it up to find the file folders loose from the cover and causing liner to come loose i could not get the two of the three lock <unk> to work returned to a repair shop jan # not impressed thus far
the inside upper back section that holds the file folders tore free now the folders fall out of the bottom and the case will not close without pulling them back inside this happened after about two months of use i would not purchase this item again i will need to deal with samsonite to get an exchange - bummer
i do n't find this product on samsonite 's web site , so it might be discontinued anyway , i 've had a previous version of this <unk> attache case for # years and have liked it a lot this one is a little disappointing because the files section only has two pockets instead of the three i was used to , and they do n't seem to open as wide also , i 've had to learn to open it in an upright position because the files tend to fall out if i open it when it 's flat , which did not happen with the earlier version other than that , i 'm pleased with what i got
a very sturdy product ca n't be shut unless the <unk> combination remains in the open sequence plenty of room though it could use more organizational compartments would buy one again
four stars because , in my mind , it was n't this big it 's a little <unk> looking -- the usual comment i get is & # # ; what are you carrying in there , the nuclear <unk> ? & # #
happy with this product the case is quite deep , # inches , more than a slim-line for sure construction seems to be pretty solid overall , pleased husband has used this now for several months
there 's more room in here than my normal laptop bag , which helps when i 'm on a # -day business trip and need a bit more room the wheel assembly does n't take up that much room the side <unk> is pretty convenient for getting the laptop out for security most importantly , as long as i do n't allow any bulges in the front , it fits under the seat in front of me : -rrb- my only wish is that it had a luggage strap in the back i went to <unk> <unk> and bought one , but it 's not quite the same as having one in the case itself
i was a little skeptical when i saw the notebook compartment specs but went ahead and took a chance with this bag to my surprise this bag accommodated my sony vaio nicely very spacious with lots of padding to protect your notebook i give this bag a #
though difficult to find , the <unk> case exceeds all others i have used for twenty five years the somewhat utilitarian appearance is <unk> by it 's durability and its ability to well protect soft or delicate objects
my husband goes through briefcases about one every two years his last good one was a samsonite so when we found this one on amazon , he was thrilled it 's just what he 's been looking
i liked the laptop sleeve until the metal body glove logo label on the front chipped the top of my laptop the label is a metal logo that has # prongs that fit through a back piece and then fold over well , the prongs were not folded flat and one of them took a huge chip out of the cover of my laptop i 'm lucky i did n't have a tablet or it would have ruined the screen and fellowes has an extremely frustrating and complicated claims process i do not recommend this product i gave it # star because they would n't let me give it # a protective case that <unk> damage is useless
there is a little body glove metal logo attached to this sleeve the metal tabs are not exposed ; they are covered by the inner surface of the sleeve nonetheless , the metal tabs are harder than the case of my laptop , and the neoprene is thin this $ # - $ # `` protective sleeve `` put an # inch very visible scratch on the <unk> beautiful silver surface of my $ # laptop
i have a # inch hp laptop and it takes me at least # minutes to zip this up the case would be great if it was about # inch bigger all the way around there is no way i can get papers or anything else in the case
well this could have been better the sleeve needs more padding around the sides and then it would have been a better product it is constructed on thin material and it is lacking in side impact protection mind you it should work well as an around the office or around the home but it <unk> in comparison to the timbuk # product and the <unk> that i also own
i bought this case a few months ago for my ibook to be able to take to school with me in my laptop it worked okay , my ibook fit with no problem and all the equipment i needed for it fit with room to spare however , the case collects hair like a magnet which is a problem in a household with pets it shows ! ! ! the other problem i encountered was that it did n't protect my ibook enough i eventually resorted to placing a pillow in the bottom of my backpack to protect better when it is put down it did n't help much and i ended replacing its harddrive when it died i would use this product if you need to keep all your laptop things together and plan to put it in a suitcase or a place where it is going to be <unk> as little as possible for people like me , this does n't work and i will be switching soon to a case with a strap
very elegant black roomy interior with couple pockets i was disappointed it did not have thicker padding i do not think / feel that it provides enough protection as it is may be i should have bought the comp bag for a little more money instead of this sleeve - but for the price it is ok and functional i slide it into another bag unfortunately it has no handles to hold on to -lrb- it would have been more <unk> even doubled for some sort of a <unk> a short work <unk> -rrb- <unk> look and slides nicely into your <unk> like more protection for my
this bag ended up being a little too roomy for the laptop , bu i 'm able to store the power cord in it as well padding was ok wish it had a handle
i should have known better than to listen to the written reviews saying this would fit a # . # `` laptop . # . # `` laptops come in all different sizes this sleeve will not adequately protect a dell inspiron # . # `` you can force it to zip over this laptop , but it will leave the corners of your laptop protected only by the zipper rather than the padding built into the sleeve even worse , the zipper is forced to directly contact the corners of your laptop and can possibly scratch it you should always try to size a laptop sleeve at your local <unk> retailer before you buy online
fits a # in widescreen laptop perfectly i think i 'd prefer a bit more padding on the bottom as that 's the mostly likely place of impact i 'm not saying there is no padding , but not to the degree like you find in the walls o , and for # $ or whatever it 's still an amazing deal
this case is a perfect fit for my lenovo w # with the # cell battery , it might be a little loose on w # with a standard battery the only reason i did not give it # stars is that it would be nice if there was a pocket on the outside
the item says # -inch it is however # . # `` -- way too big for my thinkpad t # i liked the sleeve ; it 's well padded would have given # stars if my laptop had snugly fit in it i am going to return it though
i bought this sleeve for some extra protection for my # . # laptop when not in use it seems to be handy for storing my laptop neatly in my home and for protecting against the elements during travel -lrb- i.e . storing in seat front pocket on airplane -rrb- the sleeve also provides some extra cushion for my laptop when it 's in my backpack product fits my # . # inch laptop with a little room to spare for a <unk> cable the material is not quite what i expected but it still provides adequate protection
i think this product is great the cushion is firm yet soft enough not to scratch your laptop my laptop is a smaller hp -lrb- # inch -rrb- and it fits nicely into the glove ... not leaving too much extra space it is very snug , and reliable to travel with in a messenger bag , or backpack
i bought this for my wacom intuos # x # pen tablet to keep it safe in transit in my laptop bag it fits perfectly of course the mouse and pen do n't fit inside but i store them in a compartment in my laptop bag
i bought my daughter a cool leather bag for her mac laptop , but the leather was not really soft and she worried there was n't enough padding the body glove sleeve fit perfectly in the bag and gave just enough cushion and protection without adding extra weight she said she did n't have any trouble with the emblem that others mentioned in their reviews
i bought this about # months ago for my macbook i have now bought another of these for my lenovo t # i guess that says a lot about it pros + good padding overall wo n't protect your laptop in a # feet fall though : -rrb- + compact enough for carrying it in other backpacks cons - not the most ergonomic to carry , as it lacks handles or shoulder straps - not much room once the laptop 's in it barely carries my lenovo power supply and an extra mouse
i got it for my old dell -lrb- b # , # . # -rrb- and this works well my laptop fits neatly inside the glove without any problems if you 're willing to spend more money , i 'm sure you will be able to find a better product but for those on a budget or people like myself who just need something simple , this is a good buy
very nice looking bag in your hand great quality and nice looking logo . fits my # . # inch notebook the inside of the case how ever is nylon i was hoping that it would have been cloth to help reduce minor scratches on my notebook glossy finish : d . . but . . i just turned it inside out and took off the metal logo
this is a no frills case that will hold your laptop just fine so far i 've noticed no new dings or scratches on my # `` powerbook while the padding feels a little thin and my computer is n't completely snug , for the price , you really ca n't beat this case
i bought one of these a year ago , and when i bought a new hp <unk> # with a # . # `` widescreen , it was the only choice it takes about # seconds to remove the metal logo if you are concerned about scratching your laptop with an inside pocket to store my <unk> papers
not only was the shipping on this item incredibly fast , but unlike the bag i bought , it was well packaged as well i 've been very happy with the sleeve it fits my # . # inch mac book pro perfect , and does n't even take up that much more space in my bag it has enough cushion that i dont have to worry about my laptop getting hurt or scratched when im taking it places , but not enough cushion to get annoying i highly recommend this product
maybe this sleeve is not memory foam or anything fancy but it fit my # . # `` macbook pro perfectly i actually left the piece of foam that came with it in the internal pocket for extra padding so it is extra snug on my machine
this product is perfect fit into my laptop # . # `` lcd at first i 'm afraid it can not support or does not have more space to zip but perfect ! in side , there is one space to put other documents separate to laptop also
this case is excellent for traveling with todays <unk> controls at the airport gate you can narrow down to # back pack just throw your laptop in this case stuff in your back pack and your off nice and small while providing protection from your other gear
easily fits my # `` macbook pro with enough space in the inner pocket for a slim book or bunch of papers/folders looks nice and feels good have n't tested its durability being dropped , thankfully
i bought this bodyglove notebook sleeve for my dell inspiron # it 's a perfect fit and the workmanship is great i 'm impressed with the quality for only $ # . # i would recommend it highly
i bought this sleeve for my # wacom intuos # it fits very well , maybe a little loose , but there is space for the cable and extra papers whatever issues there were with the bodyglove logo , they seem to be resolved as there is a lining and the logo is rubber and sewn on great sleeve at a great price
amazing that they can -lrb- or , anyway , did -rrb- sell this item for the price the two i bought were quite sleek and nicely sewn i 've purchase several fellowes laptop bags and sleeves and have found them to be real bargains not only that , but one saved a brand new powerbook when i went head over heels over a train track in boston that bag hit the ground * hard * and the laptop was still perfect other bags may look <unk> , but fellowes gets the job done , which is what matters to me
i tried this sleeve on three laptops and it fits a # . # `` size snugly , but just fine -lrb- in fact the tag says # . # on it ! -rrb- it is well padded on the sides and bottom , but not so much at the zipper other reviewers talked about a metal emblem - there is only a sewn emblem on mine , so they must have changed this for under $ # , you ca n't beat this
i have to bring my laptop along on travel and just put it into my airplane carry-on after finding a crack in the case i checked several stores for something to put my laptop into that would protect it the store prices <unk> from $ # . # up this laptop body glove fits my laptop perfectly , keeps it safe from damage -lrb- so far -rrb- and the price was right for me i highly recommend it
do n't buy this product for a # `` widescreen computer unless you can try it out in a store first i purchased this for my dell e # and there 's no way , no how , that <unk> can fit i think that the vendor , fellowes , is guilty of false advertising even the tag that comes with the case says that the interior dimensions of this case are # . # `` x # . # `` x # . # `` i 'm an idiot because i did n't read all of these reviews first stating that the case would not fit a # `` computer
the item description explicitly stated that the sleeve was # `` however , when i received the item did not fit my # `` dell notebook the item may fit notebooks up to # `` , but definately not # `` not only that , when i called pc <unk> -lrb- the company that shipped the item -rrb- they said that amazon listed the item incorrectly nevertheless , i was pleased with the way amazon handled my return
although it is called a # `` notebook sleeve , it did not fit my laptop i bought it online for my new dell inspiron # `` laptop , however the # `` notebook sleeve is shorter by over an inch both in length and width dimensions the online company ant did not include in their product description the dimensions and therefore led you to believe it will fit all # `` portable computers which is obviously not the case ! ! they offered me to return it at my expense and additionally charge me a `` restocking fee `` even though they mislead me
i bought this bag for my # `` dell m # , and it wo n't accomodate the laptop at all the interior dimensions are # . # `` x # . # `` x # . # `` . -lrb- # <unk> # <unk> # mm -rrb- i should have read the review before buying the item the seller wo n't take the item back either , so now i am stuck with a bag that i dont need
nah it ai n't that stretchy i wish i would have seen these reviews before i bought this ! i thought a # `` screen would need # `` of space not in the land of body glove , you only need # . # `` right ? it ai n't a <unk> ! sending mine back it 's too big for my # `` screen too
i ordered this sleeve after carefully measuring my hp laptop and realizing that i needed a sleeve larger than the # inch one when the # inch sleeve came , it was wide enough but too short and would not zip shut the enclosed paperwork did give me a return address but no information about the purchase price i mailed the sleeve back but have heard nothing from the sender and received no refund
i liked the laptop sleeve until the metal body glove logo label on the front chipped the top of my laptop the label is a metal logo that has # prongs that fit through a back piece and then fold over well , the prongs were not folded flat and one of them took a huge chip out of the cover of my laptop i 'm lucky i did n't have a tablet or it would have ruined the screen and fellowes has an extremely frustrating and complicated claims process i do not recommend this product i gave it # star because they would n't let me give it # a protective case that <unk> damage is useless
i should have read the reviews before purchasing this product - i gave it away to friend who has a # . # `` notebook it 's not what the description claims , you wo n't fit a # `` notebook into this sleeve
this cover <unk> 's <unk> a # inch computer . it is too small . it is of nice quality for smaller computers i do recommend however not for # in monitor
the case is great , however , my computer does not fit in the advertisement says that it fits `` up to `` # in . computers it <unk> my toshiba satelite l # s # by almost # inch very close , but not quite it
i like <unk> products in general have looked for a while for a good # `` sleeve this one looks like what i wanted & is definitely well made however , it is too small from top to bottom ... wo n't zip up perhaps my machine is <unk> for a # `` ... it is an <unk>
because the wrong dimensions are on listed for the item how can they be the same as the smaller sleeve ? ! ? ! ? it would be nice if you could let amazon know but <unk> they do not have contact info like a normal <unk> at the bottom of the page not even for the <unk>
while i would n't return this item , i would n't be too quick to recommend it the padded sleeve fits snugly which is nice ; however i find that the closure for the strap is much too flimsy and <unk> as to how well and for how long it will hold
great quality & product but while the width was fine , it is not deep enough to cover the hp pavillion # series laptops this is the perfect sleeve for additional protection from dust , shock , etc . for your laptop i needed it so i could carry my laptop in my leather briefcase that has no padding and was not designed for laptops it would have been perfect if it had only been deeper it was shallow by about # inches if anyone knows of a neoprene sleeve that will fit the <unk> # series # `` post a note
got the # `` for my dell # -lrb- # `` -rrb- just to be safe but even this is too small for the laptop - the other dimension is # `` which is not enough
i bought this <unk> the reviews because my laptop is # . # `` , but this barely fits even that it also does n't look or feel as if it offers much protection if i were to do this over again , i would 've <unk> on the nicer $ # . # case i gave it # stars because i knew it would be small , with no extra pockets or even a shoulder strap , and i went ahead with the purchase <unk> , i hope someone <unk> from my mistake
i did not have any delays in the shipping it was on time but disappointed that it did not fit the new hp pavillion notebooks dv # nr the laptop was too long to insert into the sleeve i was looking forward to using this as additional padding for my targus laptop back pack now i have to search somewhere else to find the right one for my laptop they have to be specific now when they are saying it will fit a # inch laptop , because it does not fit all them
dont be <unk> this model says # `` yet it wont fit a # `` notebook very misleading , other than that it seems to be an ok product . but only buy if you plan to use it for your # `` notebook or you will be disappointed
looks and feels good , but unfortunately , it does not fit most # `` and even some # . # `` laptops on the market today i took mine to the local best buy to see how many # `` laptops could fit in it and we only found one we even found one of the # . # `` laptops that did n't fit <unk> glove should go back to the manufacturers and get the current measurements for the laptops that are on the market today and <unk> this one as a # . # `` model
i was looking for another of the icon notebook sleeves - a thin carrying case to offer minor protection and not break the bank since the icon was discontinued , i ordered the fellowes body glove sleeve it is a great price -lrb- $ # -rrb- and great quality however , since amazon did not have a picture , i did not know it does not have a handle or strap of any kind ... so plan on carrying it under your arm
i just received mine it is what i expected and wanted a neoprene protective `` sleeve `` to minimize bulk so i may slip it into my bag the metal logo seems to have been resolved mine has a slightly cushioned liner <unk> my laptop from the logo it does n't zip all the way with my laptop either because the zipper was sewn without enough lead from the edges or because it should have # zippers to round the tight corner better i 'm likely to modify it to not zip , and just be a sleeve for frequent access from my bag or add velcro to close it it 's the most simple and least expense option i 've found for low bulk , <unk> access of my laptop
it fits my # . # `` gateway notebook , but barely it 's a little too snug for my taste if you have a thin # . # `` notebook this sleeve should be fine i have a thick laptop and the sleeve is very tight on it again , it works best for thin laptops
i bought this mainly so i could carry my laptop to and from class , and generally just as a way to protect it from getting scratched or getting things <unk> into <unk> plugs the case is really basic although it 's for # `` notebooks it really fits # . # `` notebooks , it is just slightly -lrb- about # cm extra -rrb- larger than a snug fit some reviewers complained about the logo on the front of the case ruining their laptops but it looks pretty solid to me fellowes may have changed the design to make it more secure and prevent future damages i bought this on amazon when it was only ten bucks , which was a real bargain i do n't know if i would buy it at the price it is currently listed -lrb- about five bucks more -rrb- edit : i guess i should mention that i have a # . # `` macbook pro , which is a widescreen laptop
it is a snug fit for my dell d # latitude , it has great face and back padding but almost no edge or corner protection what so ever , as for the metal logo this version that i have received , in no way can i foresee damaging the laptop inside short of a impact great enough to damage with or without said logo my suggestion to the manufacture is to greatly increase the edge and corner padding and to substantially lower the price
the product in and of itself was exactly what i was looking for : a slim , no frills sleeve to protect my notebook when it was in my bag so that other items would n't damage it because the sleeve measures # in . , i did n't think size would be a problem , since my screen is only # / # in . across however , the actual height of my computer -lrb- when closed , what the notebook measures from top to bottom -rrb- was a bit too long for the sleeve my computer fits , but not perfectly it 's a slightly tight fit once it is zipped shut if you 're not obsessed with perfection , this should suit you fine , and for the price , you ca n't beat it
since i travel with my computer in a backpack , this sleeve has been an excellent product my computer is protected from unexpected bumps and scratches it is very well constructed
although i purchased this for my # `` laptop -lrb- which it could not accomodate i kept it for another computer it is a bit thinner than i expected but adequately cushions , as long as you do n't drop it it has a nice sleek feel and the zipper is easy to operate and durable
the other reviews are right on in saying that it wo n't fit a # `` computer it perfectly fits my # . # `` widescreen notebook -lrb- dell inspiron # -rrb- with a nice snug fit i believe that it was redesigned to not scratch the notebooks because the logo does not protrude to the interior of the sleeve highly recommended -lrb- for # . # `` notebooks -rrb-
this neoprene notebook sleeve is a sleek product that will comfortably fit your laptop up to # . # `` it is stylish and provides more than adequate production without having to carry around a bulky laptop bag also , it includes an inside pocket great for storing your power cord or other accessories it fits well into a backpack for convenient carrying and is a great value for the price
this cover fit very tight for our toshiba satellite computer which has a # . # inch screen . any screen bigger will not fit in this cover but this fit our computer perfectly was a good value for the money and i would recommend . basically will just protect the computer but does not have room inside for any accessories
while this sleeve is well made and appropriate for its intended use ... it is not large enough for my hp dv # laptop ... a true # `` laptop i recommend that you check the listed measurements and verify they meet your needs how will you fit a # `` into # . # `` sleeve ? ?
i ordered the sleeve so i could place my dell # in it to transport on the back of my motorcycle after months of use , no problems whatsoever and i would recommend it highly
do n't waste your money after less than a year of use , the <unk> breaks this makes it nearly impossible to get your camera out and renders the case useless -lrb- due to the design , you can not use it without closing the clasp . no extra storage space , either
great case , but the plastic latch is a piece of junk the is second case of this type that i have purchased , the latch failed on both cases complained to sony but they claimed no responsibility in their product i would not recommend this camera case for this reason
my f # fits snug in this bag you kind of have to stuff the camera strap into the bag which is a little annoying , but the camera fits just fine no internal sleeves or pouches for carriers stuff external zipper pouches and sleeves provide plenty of room for probably # or three extra batteries and as man memory sticks as you 'd ever need would of been nice of had a hand grip or something to better carry the bag with without having to put it on you shoulder though
this is a good case , compact , and easy to tote your camera with a few accessories one problem , the catch broke and my camera was stuck inside i had to do a <unk> with a safety pen to get it open then it was hassle for the rest of the vacation granted - i did use it for # years before it broke
the thing i like about this case is it 's soft inside , though i still keep the lens cap on , and sturdy on the outside there is plenty of pockets for filters , spare battery , memory sticks aluminum case , and the usb cable i do like the quick release latch to access the camera -lrb- <unk> # -rrb- there is a <unk> on the case if you plan to holster it on your belt the case is good for field use the only negative thing i have to say is ... it is bulky in my opinion , if you want a sleek , form-fitting case , and do not care about carrying extra accessories buy a sleeker case overall , this is a good buy
this bag is fairly well constructed and the padding is adequate but a bit thin for a road warrior it offers only basic protection if you 'll be carrying your laptop often , i would recommend buying something much more robust the price is right for an infrequent and careful traveller though be careful to make sure your computer will fit this is a small bag it will not hold an x # thinkpad do not buy for a computer larger than # `` x # ``
i have a # `` screen dell # m laptop it was tough to look # `` screen case finally i found one here . the laptop fits perfect in the case awesome , worth buying it if you looking for # `` laptops
so i bought this for my gigantic # & # # ; macbook pro that i got for work , but it does n't fit in the bag it 's nicely made , but big , and still does n't fit this behemoth of a computer
i purchased this bag because other reviews said it was very large and had plenty of room for files but i was disappointed it has a big padded area for a laptop , and additional dividers so despite the fact that it is a big bag the internal space is n't very versatile if you have larger files so the search continues
i ordered this bag to replace my current leather laptop tote it 's a nice looking bag and is about one inch wider and # inches taller than my current bag i decided to send it back for a couple of reasons - too tall for me , i 'm only # ' # `` - afraid it would n't fit under the seat although probably will laying down but not standing up - the inside non-laptop compartments had tight sealing velcro to keep them shut , seemed like it would make getting things in and out a pain
this is a nice size but it looks very cheap functionally it would be good as it 's big and has several compartments , but if you want it to look good , get something else i returned this the same day it came in
this tote was a little larger than i expected , but i still like it i purchased it for a # & # # ; mac book pro there is plenty of room for everything else the best feature for me is that it stands alone without falling over
very good bag only issue i have is there no inside organizer no place to put pens and things , except on large open pocket if there were a place to put pens and a pad or even a place to put business cards it would have been the perfect bag
my company laptop came with a typical laptop bag this fits my laptop plus everything i would normally carry in a separate bag like my kindle , magazines , notebook it came with a makeup case too strap is perfect and does n't slip off my shoulder with a heavy coat on i 'm very pleased
i love that this bag is so fashionable and practical it 's so roomy , very comfy for my laptop to sit in , and the laptop case is removable so i can use it for a normal bag the straps could maybe stand to be a little longer , but all in all this bag is a great investment
loading my necessary pounds of paperwork and <unk> , yet <unk> chic , notebook into the <unk> carryon bag of old really was n't working for me i 've been caught more than once <unk> through the aa gate , # -inch heels in hand , after being picked apart by airport security but last time i had my great new tote -- <unk> yet streamlined -- and i felt very ... together this tote gives style for the miles : <unk> to match my bag and shoes ; pull out laptop section for a <unk> , <unk> <unk> to the beach before flying home everything i need to get <unk> with my <unk> gear it 's the one
i would highly recommend this to anyone this tote is extremely durable i have now owned this for # years and let me tell you , besides some scuffs of the outside it looks brand new still ~ i take my computer hope from work daily in this and it does a wonderful job of protecting it in the middle , padded compartment i love how it has to two side compartments for me to put my papers and files in ... it ensures that my work will not get bent on the travel to and from work i absolutely love this ! !
i bought this bag both for graduate school and work so i needed the bag to be very functional , but also nice looking and professional i could not be happier my # `` mac powerbook fits very well and i can carry several files with me unexpectedly , the little detachable pouch ended up to be useful thing because i carry touch up powder and <unk> it it it 's a great buy
it was important to me that i have a computer bag that is durable and that i would n't be embarrassed to take with me to a job interview so far this bag is holding up nicely the straps are n't splitting or fraying , the stitching is still in tact , the surfaces are n't scuffed it fits my dell # & # # ; laptop nicely and because it has padding at the bottom as well as little metal feet , i never have to worry about damaging it i do n't over load it with textbooks or anything but it does nicely hold all my purse essentials -lrb- various <unk> , <unk> and power cables it 's a good buy , i recommend
received a day earlier than promised is of better quality than i expected my laptop fits perfectly along with other items it looks so professional and is very comfortable on my shoulder straps are big enough to carry over my shoulder even with my heavy coat on heavy duty zippers too glad i purchased this product it is well worth the money
i 'm a new law student and i bought this bag hoping not to need a backpack i 'm happy with the look , though it is larger than you 'd think from the pictures when you take the computer insert out , it is quite spacious , but with the insert in , it does n't use space as well business people should have no problem , but students might be pressed for textbook space when the insert is in but it is very pretty there are n't that many organizational comparments : there is only a cell phone holder and a pocket however , it does come with this little makeup <unk> holder . i 'm excited for my
love the looks , size , compartments , and removable laptop pouch keeping the bag but i wish there was padding around the inner laptop compartment that would have made it a # for sure
the mobileedge leather ultra computer tote bag is holding up as expected i bought it for my wife so that she could throw all her stuff into it and keep organized i did n't like the price at mobileedge , but i was able to find a much better price through amazon -lrb- specifically by tech galaxy -rrb- was more reasonable of course , not as cheap as other brands , but i 'm honestly expecting this one to last much longer the leather is soft , but durable not thin and sanded down like i see on most of the other brands the bottom corners are still holding up after a month of use and do n't show any signs of wear or fading time will tell
perfect bag for running around to meetings , class , teaching , etc . i love this bag because it goes with everything , has an insert for my laptop , and lots of little organizing pockets it was better than i expected plus it has feet on the bottom so it always stands upright and the zipper closes completely
i got this for my vaio <unk> # p after # months both zippers had <unk> themselves at the sharp corner one of the other corners has worn bare the case is nice looking , though
