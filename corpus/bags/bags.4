i truly received the product that i expected the low profile design is perfect and there was much more space then i expected the bag is well made and gets everyone 's attention there is space for the laptop as well as all the accessories that you need the bag is also durable and as far as i can tell it should last a long time
this laptop backpack is compact -lrb- small -rrb- ... with many <unk> for extras i use it everyday to carry my netbook , a few books , psp , blackberry , palm <unk> , and waterbottle the pockets make it convenient to keep everything organized i would buy this again ... because of the design and pockets
i love this bag i bought a camera bag from lowepro a couple of years ago and based on that product bought this notebook bag these guys design their products for users like me a pocket for everything and padding where it needs to be it is lightweight and yet very roomy i can see where a large screen notebook might be tight , so check your screen size before purchasing lowepro rocks for me
i ordered the <unk> backpack , thinking it would be in the pretty <unk> depicted in the photo instead , it arrived in an ugly <unk> gray with the company logo -- me -- stamped all over it in black it was hideous the backpack looked very functional , but if you 're buying this backpack in this color combo , i 'd proceed with caution
i really love this backpack it gives me a bit of professionalism and that `` <unk> `` look that most backpacks do n't and it is really comfortable the only thing is would change would be to make it slightly smaller
i 've had this model in black and pink leather for two years it looks professional , holds a lot of stuff , cradles my # `` laptop nicely , and is durable it still looks as good as the day i bought it my chief criticism -- and the reason it 's never become my everyday bag -- is that the shoulder straps wo n't adjust to be comfortable for a smaller adult my friend and i -- # ' # `` and # ' # `` in height -- have the same complaint
i searched for quite some time for a backpack that is professional looking that i could carry between home and work -lrb- # minute walk -rrb- for my laptop and books i am very happy with the backpack itself the quality is good and the straps very comfortable the only complaint i have applies to the <unk> backpack i have found that the black coloring <unk> into the rest of the fabric if it gets wet i live very close to the arctic circle , so snow and rain are a given had i realized this before i bought the bag , i would have bought the solid black other than that , the bag is superb -lrb- also , even though amazon does not ship overseas , it was worth paying a bit more for shipping from another merchant .
this backpack is almost perfect it has a professional finish , which is very appropriate for the business world , and is <unk> for carrying a laptop and the related accesories the distributed inner pockets makes it impossible for the backpack to get <unk> , as traditional backpacks tend to , and the padded and <unk> back make life for your laptop , and your back , most comfortable stylish and crisp , i only wish there was an external pocket for my wallet
i bought this bag for my mac book pro and it has been a great backpack i can carry my laptop without worry and has enough room for mice and a small wireless keyboard
after searching for literally the last month , i have to say i am happy with my purchase of my brenthaven pro this pack is the only one for under a hundred bucks -lrb- shop around -rrb- that i really trust with my mbp the protective padding around the computer is tough and thick all over the oversized zippers seem very secure with the lifetime guarantee , the bag is worth the money the looks are n't super cool , but that helps when you 're on-site all day and do n't want people to know what is in your bag it is an understated powerhouse
i bought this for my macbook pro and it is a life saver , literally i accidentally ran over it , with my macbook pro inside it , and it saved it the laptop did bend a little but it still works this and apple 's high quality are a perfect match
this laptop backpack was the best choice for my # `` macbook pro and all the usual gadgets that go along with it i had seen this bag in a computer store but purchased it through amazon ... seeing as it was a little bit less money that said ... it was not the cheapest priced backpack out there but it 's build quality stood out among it 's competitors if you need a well made , long lasting laptop backpack ... you should consider this product it 's not the most fashionable bag out there , but it 's ruggedness , spacious compartments and wearer comfort more than make up for the serious looking design
after extensive research i bought one of these for my # `` sony vaio super to travel with plenty of room for mouse , flash drive , power cords , cell phone and any other small electronics or accessories after a year it still looks brand new purchased a second one as a christmas gift
this was purchased for my husband to use with his new macbook pro if you want a slim , flexible backpack , then this is not for you this backpack is large , sturdy , and very well made with pockets for everything that you can think of it comes with a great warranty that i doubt we will ever need this product is meant to go the distance
i 've been using one of these cases for nearly ten years until one of the zippers finally gave out i found the same model on amazon.com and ordered it eagerly it turns out that several changes have been made to the case , probably to reduce cost some of the storage areas have been removed , and an entire zipper has been replaced by velcro tabs further , another one of the zippers jammed within a week of starting to use it i 'm better off with the old case with the broken zipper , so i returned this one the seller only gave me enough for a used unit , however , since i had opened it already
this is a very sturdy bag with plenty room for every thing i store my computer , power brick , # <unk> , # books and lots of other miscellaneous stuff i would buy it again in a heartbeat
i did n't buy this bag through amazon but i have owned the same one for five years and use it about six days per week it has lots of room and has held up very well i recommend it highly it is an excellent value for the price
awesome storage with a most intelligent organization of anything and nearly everything a <unk> or mature student would want in an over-the-shoulder or <unk> brief case the choice of materials and the build quality leave nothing to be desired
purchased at office max for $ # using this bag for the new lenovo g # . # in laptop the only con i see is that the strap is not removable my intent was to find a bag that gave me nearly the space of a backpack but looked professional and this hit the nail on the head you can always upgrade to roller bags and have a little more space but then you will look like an old person if you want a breifcase bag with enough room for a book or two and a binder , this will do the job i do n't think it would fit a # in laptop
the bag is not the quality i expected from samsonite this bag will not last very long one trip out and the wheels are all ready starting to go in different directions
i like the idea of this bag but i find it shocking the zipper of the main pouch -lrb- where the computer is -rrb- broke after six months for a road warrior tool , this is not <unk> , particularly from a & # # ; brand & # # ; name i have dealt with the the teared zipper for three months , but now the zipper broke entirely , so i ca n't use this anymore maybe i got a lemon , but i am highly annoyed a few other design issues - the telescopic handle is pretty unsteady , and some of its screws on top are coming loose easily -lrb- i had to tighten them twice , and no , i do n't <unk> around in airports - you ca n't unload your computer without unzipping the pouch all together in which case the bag does n't stand up anymore -lrb- bad overall balance
nice briefcase , but the wheels make it stick out and wo n't allow it to fit in an overhead of smaller airplanes was really disappointed as i loved the spin however , the extension handle was very wobbly returning the bag and going back to my smaller older briefcase
advertised for its spacious interior space - not true wheels unbalanced and difficult to maneuver on all four ... find myself pulling it on two a great disappointment and poor materials for the construction
this is kind of an odd computer bag it basically splits in the middle and if the computer is in it , it falls over it works fine and is great in airports but the design is not what i would buy again
as a research professor i travel quite often and have been using this bag for a year now i have had no problem with the handle getting stuck and i love the ease of mobility that the spinner wheels give you unfortunately , i am looking to replace this bag due to a frustrating design problem in order to get anything out of the main compartment you have to completely unzip the bag , unzipping just the top part does not give you enough room to get to anything but more frustrating is that the padded laptop holder is located in the front of the main compartment , so when you do completely unzip the bag , the heavy laptop flops forward causing the bag to tumble over
love this bag , really good for traveling as it gets you right down the aisle i agree <unk> that the only thing that needs to be improved is the main compartment - you have to open it all the way to get at computer , takes getting used to
nice size , rolls great my only complaint would be that it falls over very easily when you unzip to take out laptop very front heavy can be very annoying at times otherwise no other complaints
i love the space and all the storage areas great for me working between offices i even recommended it my boss she ordered one and loves it the only thing that worries me is that the pull out handle is kind of loose i worry about it snapping off
this bag is perfect to carry on airplanes the # wheels allow you to roll down the aisles instead of lifting and it fits under airplane seats as well , so no fighting for overhead space it holds a bit less contents than my regular wheeled briefcase , but is worth it for the flexibility in pushing and pulling this bag it does take a bit of practice to roll it as it is different than a <unk> bag , but i 'm learning
great spinner function - so much better than the <unk> portfolios when you 're traveling it easily goes down the aisle sideways it 's relatively small , so storage space outside of your laptop and materials will be minimal you ca n't stuff your overnight gear in there as well - i still need a separate carry-on for that
purchased another similar bag at a big box store then saw this item on amazon opted to keep this item because the case stays open without falling to the floor once you unzip it my husband is taller and for his <unk> he takes large files back and forth from his office the height of the carrier is perfect for him without having to <unk> <unk> while walking
i was killing my shoulder carrying my laptop bag along with another briefcase with all of my files since getting this briefcase , i am able to fit everything in it it has terrific pockets to keep everything organized as well the wheels are great it does n't tip over when i open it either
i have been shopping for a new wheeled computer tote for over a year i have gone to every office product store in my area with no success i was nervous about ordering this product online due to not <unk> able to see it in person , but i was getting desperate to my surprise , the samsonite # is absolutely exactly what i have been looking for it is a little larger than what i need , but i love it
i travel every week for work and have been very satisfied it fits under the seat of the plane and <unk> are sturdy and durable i abuse it with overpacking and it holds up well would buy it again in a heartbeat
i was n't sure what to expect i carry a lot of music books and computer equipment daily and use this bag to move from class to class the spinner wheels make traveling from building to building much easier the handle seems a little weak , but that 's ok because the weight is distributed all in the bag my classmates just love the bag and want to move from backpacks to a rolling bag
i would give this item # stars for the <unk> wheels alone i like the telescopic handle and roomy compartments -lrb- main compartment has pockets that hold a # & # # ; <unk> -rrb-
this case is a perfect match for the road warrior and portable office needs best feature is all direction rolling which is perfect for turning sideways and rolling down the aisle on aircraft and navigating through crowds in airports solid construction and only needed to replace my older unit to an eventual failure of the zipper no complaints as it has done five years of hard service and <unk> me nothing i recommend this unit as it definitely meets the requirements at a very reasonable price
love the # wheels i had one in the past for # years tried the # wheel one and it just does n't roll right let alone the bar eventually will break one the front not allowing the bag to stand right so back to what i know works other reviews state it falls over at times , its a balancing act ... if you have too many <unk> on one side , yes it will fall over but if you leave the handle up it will balance it out : -- rrb- cords and mouse fit in the front compartment just fine
this bag works really well for my current job which involves taking files and laptop with me to various office buildings as well as various rooms in my base office i 'm able to fit all the essentials and am much more organized it also is saving me from juggling <unk> , etc and is providing physical relief for my back and arms
the color is too <unk> <unk> for me , but the case itself is nice bought an i-pad , so now i leave my laptop home i used this case just a few times
item look exactly as described i feel like its the most <unk> looking laptop bag i 've seen it would be great if it could come to fit a # `` macbook pro though ` cos it 's a bit big for me
this is a great bag if you are looking for a thin fashionable laptop case it is not sophisticated or classy by any means it holds the laptop really good and has good protection the faux croc material looks much <unk> in real life i have a # inch laptop and it fits just right with the little pouch next to it if your laptop is any bigger , you will have to do without the pouch and without it , there will be no room for a charger my charger fits in the pouch really snug so far , i am enjoying this case because i wanted something that was really cute and not bulgy and this does the job
this bag is sexy , feminine , and chic the only problem i have is that i think it should have the carrying handles on the outside which makes it more functionable to carry and made from the <unk> the handles that stores inside makes this laptop bag look cheap
i ordered this case based on the fact that it popped up when i searched for a `` # . # `` laptop bag `` and some reviews said their # `` laptops fit great in this bag when i got the bag , the tag said it was for # `` laptops in my case , i have a hp pavilion dv # with a # . # `` screen i guess it `` fit `` in the bag but it was like a person putting on a size # shoe when they wear a size # ; you can get your foot in it , but not very comfortably the sides bulged out and it was difficult to zip around the corners also , there was not much room to put accessories ... namely the charge pack i will say , the bag was very high quality it would have definately been a keeper if my laptop and charger fit
nice case for the price has <unk> my daughters more expensive case and she is using this one now has been everywhere hawaii trip , <unk> trip on airplanes , cars , and boats do n't even need a purse when carrying because everything fits inside -lrb- there is room for magazines , credit cards , etc . -rrb-
this bag is great for my husband 's # `` laptop it holds the computer as well as the power brick and all the other gadgets he needs only drawback is that the case does n't open up all the way to facilitate putting the laptop into the case
this case is well made and has a lot of pockets for stuff , but it is not as large as it appears and struggles to hold anything that is not flat i had some noise cancelling headphones that barely fit on the first trip i took with it
this laptop case looks very much like most on the market the one con is a huge con it does n't open all the way the main compartment only opens about # of the way the pros are ; lots of pockets for mp # player , cell phone , camera , pens , papers and the like another pro is the sturdy strap with metal hooks attaching them the main compartment has velcro adjustments to accomodate machines up to # inches it is very snug and secures my laptop well in place i would like to give it # stars , but the one con is too much of a con for the price though i would have to recommend it
i have a sony vaio # . # inch laptop and was n't sure which bag would actually fit the best after reading several reviews about other bags being too tight , i <unk> onto this one it was a perfect fit and not only that , it was well padded , with very strong construction , and a lot of pocket space for other accessories great buy and a great bag
i <unk> over several laptop cases before choosing this one i am so glad i purchased it the design is excellent it holds all of my play toys that i travel with i have my laptop , a camera , <unk> mp # player , phone , all accessory items for each , including all product booklets i have paper , pens , scissors , notebooks , <unk> , a case containing # dvd 's , you name it , and i still have room left i do n't think you could get a better laptop case than this one
the case is very well constructed and has all the pockets i could ever wish for materials are very sturdy and construction is top notch the shoulder strap clip is metal as opposed to plastic - a previous bag i had used plastic and eventually broke i like the simple design because it does n't scream `` come steal me - i have a $ # . # laptop inside me . dimensions suggest it will fit my new # `` laptop , but have n't received laptop yet
top notch nylon case that fits a # . # laptop perfectly since it has <unk> flaps that accommodate any size laptop enough storage for most of the stuff you `` want `` to carry even handles a large brick -lrb- power supply -rrb- without problems
i have been using this daily for over a year and i love it i do n't always carry my laptop in it unless travelling usually it is my man purse i keep my glasses , mouse , lunch , cables , phone ... in it it looks great and is very durable with plenty of compartments for lots of stuff i have owned several cases like this and this is the best i have owned
i find there is little i can add to previous reviews other then to state the size laptop it will hold the packing on it states it will hold a # to # inch laptop and is a # `` case , not a # . # as advertised the best way to determine if your laptop will fit is to measure the laptop itself and not the diagonal measurement of the lcd panel my laptop is a # inch and measures # . # inches long and is a snug fit personally i would not try to fit one larger then # inches long into this case
this case costs about the same as all the others but i think it 's better simply because there is an outside , zippered pocket to hold power pack and other random items easily and securely the neoprene is thick enough to protect your laptop and i like the colors
the only comment that i have is that i wished that i had purchased it earlier this case has plenty of room to store cables and peripherals , and at the same time it protects my laptop well
this is a great product in quality & pricing plenty of room for my thinkpad & power cord inside section outside section i have my travel docs , magazine & pens so it 's nice to pull out a single pack on the plane you wo n't be disappointed
i am very disappointed that after only having this product one month , the strap broke the seller `` everything 's discounted `` did not respond to me despite me attempting contact twice this is a cheaply made strap on the case the rest of it works fine so far
the title pretty much says it all i barely even used it from my place to the car , and then to the university the strap fell apart and made my computer crash onto the ground fortunately my computer was fine , but i had to throw this thing out
- within # hours of use , the zipper broke -lrb- the part that you pull on came off from the zipper track -rrb- i <unk> the loose part onto the zipper myself to fix it -lrb- it was quicker than returning it -rrb- - strap broke within about # weeks of use the strap is attached by plastic hooks with a relatively thin wire clip securing the strap hook onto the bag handles -lrb- see the pictures -rrb- the wire bent , came out of its holes and no longer secures the strap hook in place , leading to me dropping my laptop a few times , whenever the strap hook <unk> itself - the zipper handle broke again , leading to me loosing the part after about # weeks of use i personally do not like the fact that the main laptop compartment opens up completely , # degrees rather than from the top only this was especially aggravating when the zipper broke and everything inside could fall out
it looked like a good deal within two months of purchase the clip that attaches one side of the shoulder strap to the side of the bag broke so i had to <unk> a fix soon thereafter the carry handle broke i compared it to my wife 's bag and noticed the carry handled on hers is riveted , not sewn -- it makes a difference you get what you pay for
the case has plenty of room , but there are a few things i do n't <unk> -rrb- the inside pockets do n't have any closure snaps once you unzip the outer compartments the pockets inside do n't have any way to close them so small items , like thumb drives , fall out and roll around b -rrb- since the laptop sits inside a # sided compartment you have to pick up the laptop instead of sliding it out c -rrb- the keeper spring on the shoulder strap hooks , the hook that fastens the strap to the case , one has already broken off -lrb- less than a month of light use -rrb- also , the swivels on the shoulder strap hooks do n't actually swivel too well , hence , the strap constantly needs to been <unk> i finally removed the strap completely and use the carrying handle not too thrilled with this case i 'll keep it as a backup , but i will purchase a much better design i would not recommend this to a friend , spend a little extra money and get something that really is easy to use the item that is really annoying is having everything fall out of the pockets , that 's just unacceptable
this is not a very durable product within # days , the handle ripped away from the case after very little use it is just a stitched handle and not reinforced in anyway not what i expect from caselogic products i do not recommend the vnc- # model
just three months of minimal use and a shoulder strap hook is broken at least the case protected my laptop when it hit the ground immediately after the strap broke other than that , the bag was perfect for my # `` macbook pro
nice case but bare bones the targus is padded more on the corners and bottom and i did n't want to risk a $ # laptop by saving $ # over a targus
the size computer it would hold was <unk> . up to # `` is stretching it . my hp # `` was to big for the case otherwise the case was fine if you have a computer bigger than # . # look at other models
the case is reasonable well make but definitely not the best , consistent with its low cost the zippers are plastic so be careful not to force them the shoulder strap is attached to its clips with a piece of plastic that fails to hold with a moderate tug you should plan to replace the shoulder strap if you need one there is one unzippered pocket in the main compartment and two external zippered pockets
i like to have a # `` laptop for <unk> and also for gaming i travel a lot so it is awkward carrying a big computer around but it is still worth it to me so i can help fight the <unk> of hotels the case seems to be made well but i am only giving it two stars because it is a pretty tight fit and gets to be a pain after a while they should build the case a little wider
i wish it would have come with two of the the movable side paddings my laptop is a little bit smaller than this bag it has one movable side padding , one more would have been nice in my situation one side is nicely padded and the other side <unk> up against the other side of the case that is not padded overall i am satisfied with the purchase i have added my own side <unk> padding -lrb- <unk> <unk> pad sections -rrb- that seems to work pretty well
overall the case is very nice has <unk> of compartments that i can use the only part of the gave me problems was the strap i found that it wasnt very durable and it broke on me only a week after using it if possible i would change this part
i was really excited to get this i loved the pockets however i 'm a student , and needed to use it everyday my laptop is n't very heavy -lrb- being a # inch screen -rrb- after about # months the inside started to tear then the zipper on the outside pocket tore , and the pocket just <unk> open i 've had to rig it rendering it useless i did really enjoy this bag , and i still use it however if you 're going to use it everyday it does n't have a long life span
the case itself is great since it 's large and there 's lots of room for the laptop and pockets for other things less than a week after i started using the case , one of the strap clips broke off and i had to go out and buy a new strap i had n't given it too much use , so i was n't too happy with that other than that , i have n't had any problems with it
it 's ok could be better zipper binds and inside straps get in the way of the zipper it does what it 's suppose to do for the money you get what you pay
i used it for several months before the case strap broke i continue to use it with another strap it has a good amount of pockets for all your needs i recommend this product
this well-padded case is more than big enough for my # `` hp laptop be careful with the included strap though the clip where the strap attaches to the case broke on me as i was getting out of a <unk> and the whole thing fell to the sidewalk my laptop did not suffer any damage though i replaced the strap and still use the case regularly
the case has a nice appearance with ample storage and holds my rather large laptop computer nicely its construction is acceptable for a low end shoulder bag but trust me , it wo n't be mistaken for an expensive <unk> mail bag carried by folks flying in the first class seats overall its functional , padded nicely and cleans up well
the title says # . # `` , however it 's actually # . # `` -- which makes a big difference in size i 'll be returning it for one that says # `` or # `` maybe then i 'll get the # `` that i 'm looking for . p.s . : yes , i see now that the detailed specs list it as # . # `` wide but after seeing the giant # . # `` in the title , one would assume that would have been correct still a nice bag though just too big for me
this was a amazon suggestion when i bought my dell laptop and the laptop fits the case very well . and was very affordable to boot . i am very pleased with this purchase
i purchased this laptop case for my # `` dell laptop it is just the right size for me no difficulty using it and it is streamlined and easy to carry i do n't carry too much with me , but there is sufficient room if needed i am very pleased with my purchase
we purchased the case logic vnc- # laptop case for a hp g # us laptop with a # . # `` screen i was a little concerned that it might not be wide enough but it works great even with one of the short usb wireless mouse <unk> installed it may be a little better product if it were padded a little more not a bad value delivery time was very acceptable
for the price , this case is serviceable my dell # `` studio fits inside taking up the entire space the charger and mouse fit in the outside pocket the case is not as protective as previous cases i used when flying commercial with smaller laptops , but they were more than double the price for personal travel in the car , it is fine not much room for files or paperwork , but still adequate for my <unk> use after six <unk> car trips , i would recommend this for personal use where rough handling is not a concern i can not comment on durability at this point
the case is light and easy to use works well except that it is just barely larger than a # `` laptop which makes a tight fit which requires you to store the power cord in another area of the case however that is a minor inconvenience i like that it does not weigh a lot or take up a bunch of room
i bought an asus g # <unk> # laptop and it is heavy the case itself is really great aside form the ugly logo on it , but i 'm picky it has plenty of compartments inside and was amazed that it could hold not only my over sized laptop , large battery , portable hard drive and all the cables without even bulging however this may have contributed to the problem i had the hook where the strap meets the case snapped i still use the case but without the shoulder strap in any event , it should have been able to hold it but perhaps i was <unk> it 's limits nevertheless , great case
i like the case it has lots of features for the money the only disappointment was that the movable <unk> was missing i decided it 's not worth the hassle to return it for that item
i 've liked this bag it is pretty slim , which was a key feature to me it has just enough extra compartments to keep track of the few odds and ends i have , but not so many to defeat the purpose of having a slim computer bag i use a # `` macbook which provides a little extra room for a # `` notebook in the main compartment
thought it was a little on the cheap side when i first got it , but after using it , i think it will suit my needs pretty well would like to see a little more padding all around am thinking of buying a sleeve to give it a little more padding . fits a # . # `` screen with room for a mouse and power cords like the fact that you can use the computer without taking out of the case adequate storage for pens and such will have to see how it holds up , but do n't think you can beat it for the price save your receipts , packing says it comes with a # year quality guarantee
i did not own a case for my # -inch laptop , so i purchased this based on the reasonable price and positive reviews by other customers i am very pleased with the purchase it accommodates my laptop perfectly , and has lots of pockets for holding papers , mouse , power cord , etc . i would definitely recommend it
case is ok - good for <unk> pocket not quite as deep as i had thought from description , but still able to get most of the items in i have to carry took a little longer to get than i had thought , and item did not ship usps as i understood , but ups seems very sturdy and appears to be of good material i would probably buy again from this site
fits well , but it is huge i enjoy this case , but its really big , so a bother to bring with me when i have other bags to carry or bring i like the case regardless , but like i said just a bit big
i have a vostro # inch laptop it is an exact fit inside the case there is no extra room inside for the power cord you can cram the power cord in one of the outside pockets , tight fit if you 're looking for safely carrying your # `` laptop , this is it if you 're looking to carry your extras , go larger
nice case and just enough room it 's not the most padded computer case i have ever had but will do the job zippers and nylon are sturdy have n't tried them in airport security yet , but expect they will hold up just fine for a few years
used every day for the past few months with no significant problems large enough to fit hp laptop with # . # `` screen various pockets with reasonable amount of extra storage space seems very durable , no issues with plastic strap attachments as some other buyers had noted one small issue - the inside strap does not velcro securely enough to keep computer from falling out , in the event that case is not zipped up completely i 'd say this case serves its purpose well and seems very inexpensive compared to similar products
looking for an # . # `` case was n't as easy as i thought they 're limited as to size and color in any case , this particular laptop case has plenty of pocket space , easy to carry -lrb- light -rrb- and the laptop fits into it perfectly i would recommend this case for the large end laptops
laptop case was true to advertised description met expectations for the great price . # `` laptop limited choice locally and amazon.com secured the best product available only regret is the strap attachment broke within the first week my opinion is that the snap closure is a design flaw
perfect father 's day gift it fits a # inch laptop with space for mouse & battery i recently bought it so i am not sure how long it will last but it looks sturdy so with good care you should get some years i will recommend this
i have had this laptop bag for # months i use it on a daily basis it has plenty of room for my # `` laptop and cord in the main pocket ; and i keep my tablet in the front pocket as well i am pleased with the functionality , and aesthetics of this bag however , i have # complaints the handle on top of the bag caused a strange odor on my hands i do n't know if this is some sort of reaction between my skin , and the handle , but nonetheless ; it was n't pleasing my second complaint is that i have noticed the stitching on the top of the case by the zipper is beginning to unravel i noticed it several weeks ago , and it has n't spread at all , but i 'm worried that the case might unravel at some point in the future other than that , it 's a good looking bag that works well
it is the right size for my laptop and there is room for all the accessories i need to carry , i probably needed something roomier , but for this price i could n't ask for more i am happy with it
this case very easily holds my # inch laptop and all of its cords there 's not much room for anything extra , however the construction seems sturdy and well made very pleased with this and the price was great
i am very pleased so far with this travel case -lrb- have had it for only a few months -rrb- it 's a little tight fit for my # `` sony vaio , but not to the point where you have to squeeze it in i ca n't say how smaller laptops would fit , as i do n't have to use the straps to hold it in place it is well made , good padding , good quality material my only disappointment was the storage space while it does have plenty of storage pockets , they are mainly for notebooks , business cards , etc . not designed to hold a power cord or a wireless mouse i needed a basic case for <unk> traveling and this case works well for that purpose for the price , it is a good buy
this is the cheapest case available for large laptops it looks professional , holds my power supply , and has some extra pockets for pens and paper most of the reviews complain about the durability i admit that the padding is not wonderful i hear that the little plastic parts on the shoulder strap break easily , but i just carefully care the case by the handle buying this case beats spending $ # at best buy it 's perfect for occasional use , but probably not the best choice for everyday use
