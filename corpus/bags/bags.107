i bought this for the single purpose of carrying materials about for <unk> & # # ; <unk> <unk> & # # ; for which a few pockets are useful , but not essential it replaced a sling bag which had a bit over half the interior room , and it is obviously wide enough to carry standard # / # by # letter paper without folding the appearance is every bit as rich as it appears on the amazon page it appears well made , but time will tell on that matter i would not use it if you go any distance in the rain i would not trust the leather to stand up to it well , and i 'm certain the canvas is not waterproof in heavy rain it looks classy and & # # ; old fashioned & # # ; for a very reasonable price my only complaint of any substance is that for the one outer zipper accessed pocket , the pocket expansion is <unk> , taking space from other pockets rather than outward a first class bag built for high capacity would have the pockets stretch outward
this bag is made very well , excellent material and perfect for my # year old to use for school he can fit his macbook , folders and a few other things it looks very nice and <unk> and makes for a great school bag could also be a nice and casual briefcase if you took the long strap off
we bought this as a gift for our daughter starting her student teaching <unk> she loves the outside pocket for easy assess to phone and keys and the size is perfect
like this messenger bag , get a lot of praise , great design fit perfectly unlocked iphone and ipad , there is more a combination of leather and canvas works great <unk> is one of my favorite messenger
love this messenger bag , got lots of compliments , great design fits perfect of ipads and many more the leather and canvas combination works great <unk> is one of my favorite messenger bag that i use all the time
my husband was thrilled when he received this from me as one of his christmas gifts it 's been # + months now and the bag has certainly held up to the daily grind he carries his work laptop as well as <unk> + miscellaneous items every day there is very little wear to the <unk> yet the leather is of great quality and the <unk> of the bag are casual , masculine and sturdy
i do n't get this backpack form any point of view : it is neither functional nor nice looking it has the top like an umbrella and i can not figure out how to use it to cover the upper part of the backpack if it has a <unk> in it the laptop section does not have enough padding to protect the laptop and it does look ugly , in my personal opinion
this backpack works well enough , but i find myself missing a few things it could really use side pockets with zippers rather than just partially covered velcro pockets eg . something for my sunglasses i find that it is rather flimsy , lacks the structure that i 'm use to ca n't really set it down on it 's base , as it has no structure of it 's own if the things i mention are important to you , then otherwise , this is a great backpack high quality manufacturing , comfortable straps and it is made of decent materials
this is a cute little backpack with pink zippers and a bright pink interior , so it would probably appeal most to young girls it 's got lots of pockets and quite a lot of space , but not the best design the top piece that 's supposed to cover your laptop has funky snaps on the sides with no apparent purpose , and the fit is not tight enough to protect a laptop from rain or snow furthermore , the construction and the way the straps sit on your shoulders do not give enough support to keep the weight of your laptop from causing neck and shoulder pain i pretty much always have to have my cooling pad in there along with my laptop , so it 's too heavy and does n't sit well on my shoulders and back i have another targus bag for my laptop that i can carry either like a briefcase or over my shoulder i prefer that bag , as it 's a lot less painful if i have to carry it any distance if you 're young and have no problem with heavy , awkward backpacks , this backpack might be fine for you
i 'd have given this a # if i liked the top cover portion more , but i knew i was only ok with it when i ordered and if the laptop padding was a little thicker it 's just thick enough to pad it a little yet give the bag some flexibility if that pocket is empty i tried slipping my laptop in while in its sleeve , but i barely managed to get it out again as much as i wish it were as padded as my lowepro fastpack # , i can deal with it as it is aside from that , the bag itself is very light , feels durable , and the size is perfect for my needs it 's the best replacement for my usual school bag ca n't wait to start using it
literally ordered the night before and this just showed up at my doorstep - the nylon material is waterproof and looks durable enough to <unk> through some scrapes - laptop compartment is accessible without opening the main pocket and is thickly padded on both sides for protection - the main area to store your stuff is deep and the backpack is more tall than wide - it looks cool and shoulder straps are sewn lower on the backpack , so the hood somewhat pops up and gives a <unk> style - the laptop compartment is located right on your back so if you 're carrying a laptop in there , it 's heat may make your back warm - smaller than it looks advertised the compartment is somewhat narrow and will fit just what you need and your laptop overall this is a great backpack , i was just expecting something a tad bigger when seeing the picture
i 've needed a new laptop case for a few months now , but i could n't decide what would fit my needs best not only am i carrying a laptop to work , i 'm carrying two of them , plus paperwork ! with this bag , i can keep my laptops in separate pockets so they do n't bang around on each other , plus my cords , mouse , and papers i do with the external pockets were a touch bigger , but that 's a small complaint
this has a really nice , almost waterproof exterior it has a lot of extra pockets and zippers both inside and out , and has a convenient water bottle net , to hold water however , i found this a little to bulky compared to a smaller version by a different manufacturer that i 've used for about # years now if you need a lot of separate compartments , or a slightly larger size , this is ok otherwise , when traveling on public transit , or riding on a bike with something on my back , i prefer something smaller
this review is based on an old version of the # -inch macbook pro - material feels <unk> space for laptop <unk> pockets great for small items -lrb- pencils , mouse - inside bag -lrb- velcro holds latop in place -rrb- , sleeve can hold a <unk> straps and back made of mesh fabric , feels <unk> of bag is <unk> - the inside of the bag where laptop is placed could use extra padding - backpack can hold # inch binder w / laptop , not much else can fit inside
this is a very good pack for work documents i have also been using as a weekend bag it struggles for space with clothes it is very comfortable to wear
i really like the look and feel of this bag , it feels well made and has plenty of pockets to store different gadgets one thing i really like is that it fits my # . # laptop with a laptop sleeve on - roomy laptop <unk> of <unk> <unk> - straps do n't have a ton of <unk> wish the main storage area had a little more space , so i could fit my dslr camera with pancake lens while my laptop is inside right now it 's a tight fit
for starters , this is a large laptop backpack i only have a # `` laptop , so it easily fit into this laptop but the laptop is only a small portion of what i carry i also carry a power adapter , an ipad with case , a couple of portable hard drives , a backup phone battery , tools , usb drives , disks , and documents i can safety say that this backpack easily carried them all i felt that the backpack was balanced on my back , mostly with the chest strap it was also balanced on the ground , so when i set it down , it did not topple forward or backwards there were more pockets/compartments than i needed , but it was nice to have them there just in case this backpack should definitely carry what most people need to and from work or travel
this is a high quality pack i have been using a less expensive targus laptop backpack that is much more of a traditional backpack and <unk> on the padding for the laptop this one is well worth the extra money very well put together and so much padding that you can be confident that your computer will survive if it drops i use it to bicycle commute to work and could not be more pleased
really like this sturdy backpack great padding on the back of it , the side next to your body the shoulder straps are comfortable and well padded nice assortment of pockets and the magnetic closures on the main flap were an interesting surprise , easy to close and easy to open , once you know how
this is a great , <unk> backpack the laptop compartment is lined with a soft <unk> and is a completely separate compartment there 's also another lined pocket for a tablet device inside the main compartment two pockets in the main compartment are <unk> and very deep - great for power supplies with long cords , not so much if you have a myriad of small items i fit a # -inch laptop , full-size tablet , kindle , wireless keyboard , large bluetooth speaker and all of the attendant power and connection accessories with no problem at all the exterior pockets -lrb- two on the sides and two on the back -rrb- are great for personal items i 'm very pleased
i like to take my laptops on trips and outings since i prefer a larger laptop i seem to always have problems finding suitable carry cases i tried this backpack and it is great the laptop compartment is at the back and protected nicely and the straps keep `` <unk> hands `` from being able to open the compartment the front pocket has a lot of space for paper , pens , fobs , cellphone etc . the inside compartment is very spacious and you can even fit a change of clothes as well as the electrical brick i also like the ballistic material which should protect the stuff inside from water -lrb- in case of rain -rrb- i highly recommend this backpack it also has a very nice gray color with orange accents
takes a month to ship from china . and appears to be a chinese knock off check the logos i do n't mind paying the price for swiss gear but this does n't appear so
the tags are mostly in chinese , and there are multiple <unk> words in english while i have no <unk> evidence , it is likely that you are getting a knockoff , and therefore swissgear will not honor the warranty
when i received it in the mail , with the weight of the package i was a little concerned that the build quality was in question once i opened the package i was pleasantly surprised the cargo space in the main compartment has <unk> holes three on each side of it , which were not depicted in the description i purchased this one because it was stated it was water-proof well you can imagine my concern and it remains to be seen how it will hold when the rain and snow flies
the bag was great and just as i was hoping if you want to wait # weeks as it ships from china go ahead and order from amazing i do n't want to wait that long again
the bag is very good quality zippers are not cheap , comfortable to wear , cool # . # mm headphone jack only thing i did not like was the smell when i first got it , very strong odor from manufacturing but after a week its gone fits my # inch hp probook with room to
it hold my air with a spec -lrb- thin -rrb- hard case on it yes , it 's a touch tight , but it has n't hurt the zipper i can stuff maybe # papers in the inside pocket , my ipad in the outside pocket and still zip it with no problem i do n't worry if it falls off the seat when i 'm driving to work after two months of daily use , one of the handles and a spot on the shoulder strap have started to fray
this case is exactly what i was hoping for : a compact , protective case with slim , yet durable handle . & # # ; hard carrying case & # # ; is a bit misleading surely , the case is more rigid than a neoprene slip case , but the rigid material is still <unk> the corners are definitely tough i doubt this case would protect against a heavy sharp blow ; however , i 'm <unk> it will protect my computer well the front pocket holds my power supply perfectly with room to spare inside , the pockets are really only capable of holding a notebook or other papers , not much else zippers are often a major area or criticism on laptop cases ; the two on the case are smooth and large , which seem like they will be reliable for the life of the computer i have a # -inch macbook pro
its lightweight and offers moderate protection very good value i use only occasionally so it works great for me if i were to use everyday , i would prefer something made a little more solid
streamlined and has been a secure way to travel with my macbook air only downside is my <unk> wireless keyboard does n't fit inside it at same time would have been a # star if that had been possible otherwise , great case
very happy with this case just bought my new macbook air and needed a case that is light but will protect it well laptop fits perfect -lrb- snug but not difficult -rrb- , very sturdy case
i really liked this case it 's small , yet allows room for the laptop and a few other items i might need to carry i like the hard sides that will protect the laptop from being banged around
got this case for my late # mbp it 's a wonderful little case has a pouch on the outside and another on the inside you can actually fit quite a bit of stuff in those pouches i usually keep a large microfiber cloth , power adapter , and sometimes an ipad with a # ds xl in the case along with my computer much better than a sleeve or a case that can only hold the computer by itself
this case is well designed and constructed ; it is perfectly fitted for the mac pro line and is the best case for the mac pro i have seen anywhere i would highly recommend this case to anyone who owns a mac pro
i know the case states it for the mac book # , but it works great for the new mac book # . # a very nice tight fit plus the case has inside compartment that can hold papers on the inside the case is not a total soft and not total hard , it also has an stretch band that you can slide your mac book in place inside the case that also secures it a detachable shoulder strap also comes with the case that you can attach on the other side of the case i think you will enjoy this case for the mac book # or the # . # and you will never find this case in a apple store especially at this price
i just got this hard case for new mac book pro , and i have to say that this case is awesome ! ! ! it fits well on my mac , and brings a safety belt across the laptop that hold it it also has many compartments for your dc cord and movable hard drives and etc . greats investment in this hard case is all i can say about it and zero
this was a gift i spent a good deal of time finding exactly what i wanted this case fit the bill it fits the macbook air nicely , is protective , has a cushioned inside , and has a shoulder strap to boot
case has been perfect for my mac air # small , lightweight , and easy to carry i just use it for short trips around town i do n't need a heavy duty case or a lot of thick protection wo n't hold notebook but folders slide in just fine
if you like all sorts of compartments , this is not your backpack the protection that it offers to a laptop is low it is light and small for a male
love the color and features i purchased the backpack to hold my ipad # my only comment is that the pack is bigger than i expected , not a not a problem for most people , but i am # ' # & # # ; , # lb . # year old lady i still will get on the airplane on april # th with my swissgear on
i 'm totally confused by the claims by other reviewers that their laptops do n't fit my toshiba # & # # ; fits perfectly and with space to spare -lrb- but not too much . it 's sturdy , slings over your shoulder well , has great pockets and more my last laptop bag was a targus and this is just as good
works great for me i carry everything i need for work in it the separated compartments help out a lot because all my stuff does n't fall to the bottom of the bag
i bought this backpack to replace a laptop bag that required me to either carry it in one hand or put all the weight on one shoulder my biggest challenge with backpacks is always size : i 'm # ' tall & very petite , and a lot of backpacks are just designed with bigger , wide people this bag is quite comfortable to wear and now i 'm not getting a cramped shoulder after every flight
got this for my son to lug around his books and other stuff at school seems quite room and sturdy plus it 's a good looking backpack he really likes it
the swissgear lightweight feature laptop backpack lives up to its name , being a compact and functional storage solution for my # . # inch laptop when i 'm out and about the straps are padded , ensuring <unk> , even when carried for hours on end the light blue and black color scheme also gives the design a sharp and attractive look three storage compartments effectively helps keep your belongings separate , with the main compartment <unk> for your laptop specifically overall a very nice and good quality laptop backpack for the price
i like swissgear backpacks , the quality and comfort is great i recommend this , the inner space is great for all your stuff and very resistant if you purchase this will be very happy
first off : this backpack will not hold anything bigger than a # inch <unk> in the pouch this size will be fully concealed in the pocket when placed horizontal , but placed vertically , or when placing something bigger than # inches into the pocket , will be exposed to the other area of the backpack there is a good # inch space between the bottom of the laptop pouch area and the bottom of the backpack i was ecstatic for this seemingly <unk> element it means my tablet wo n't slam on the ground if i put the backpack down , since its <unk> by the pouch , as well as the distance between the very <unk> of the backpack i 've had bags that do n't do this , and i 've <unk> when i know my laptop received a harder landing than expected that said , this was meant to protect my # inch tablet , and its perfect for it great amount of space in the compartments , and more than enough room for books , accessories , tablet , and a bit more vibrant color , and overall great quality
amazon delivered a completely defective product the main zipper was broken from the start based on this experience and on other similar reviews about defective zippers i would strongly advise against purchasing this swissgear laptop backpack it 's just money thrown out the window
i use this bag for my commute to/from work on the subway and i love it it is very comfortable , even when full with a couple of <unk> books and a # lb laptop it 's pretty sturdy and solid and there is enough padding around the laptop compartment to protect it from normal drops and bumps
this backpack was perfect for my needs it has plenty of pocket storage and fit my # & # # ; laptop easily it fits under a plane seat with no problem leaving ample legroom it is also light weight and well built and may i add , a great price
this is roomy yet slim enough to fit under the airplane seats solidly built and has some great features like an ipad pouch strategically located in the center of the pack where the least amount of damage can occur there is a business card holder , laptop pouch , zipper pocket , key clip and zippered side pocket to protect from anyone with sticky fingers trying to pick pocket you i would recommend this pack
bought this bag to replace one i 've have for a while , lots of pockets to accommodate the things i need and want to carry back and forth to work everyday great padding for my laptop and table , and my phone fits good in the pouch on the trap two thumbs up
this backpack is well made and very spacious our last backpack was a swissgear bag but the straps broke less than # mos after purchase i wanted to give the brand another try i am glad that i did i am very pleased with this purchase and its price
it 's a bit pricier than the <unk> i 'm used to purchasing , however it was worth every dollar i feel comfortable taking my laptop and other electronics around in the protective layered pocket fits my # . # `` laptop nicely and has a bunch of compartments to keep everything organized for a messy person like myself even while carrying the same amount of items as my jansport , it feels so much more comfortable on my shoulders
this is an excellent backpack that a friend recommended to me i have a really heavy company laptop to carry around and when i carry it in this backpack , it feels i am not carrying anything at all that speaks <unk> about how effectively this backpack has been designed besides it looks good also and has a sleek design that does not look bulky on the back it is made out of good material , is padded on the back and has many compartments to fit things into recommended especially if you are carrying a heavy laptop
the product is great , but the one thing that really pissed me off was the fact that in <unk> sports and outdoors it 's only # $ amazon is giving us a rip
this backpack is great , very sturdy and built well but it is much smaller than i was expecting i gave it to my niece because i would not be able to put all of my school stuff in it
a pocket for everything and easy to use ... unfortunately it is just a bit too small for anything else we bought this so my son could use it for school , but it is too small for his text books and folders it is really just for a computer and/or tablet with some paperwork or something did n't work for what we needed it , but seems to be very well constructed and padded everywhere for comfort
my boyfriend got this for himself as a way to travel with his laptop he loves it it 's spacious enough for lots of stuff , keeps his laptop safe , and is more comfortable than a handbag
i 've used my swissgear backpack for years and find it to be a very functional and durable backpack i 've carried some very heavy loads in it and it has withstood the test of time , especially after being stuffed in and <unk> from airline overhead storage compartments the padded computer storage compartment is especially useful and provides excellent protection for my laptop
this is one of the best backpacks i 've had very good quality , for a decent price i love the separate compartment for tablet i 've had it for few weeks now and it has held up to all the heavy use i & # # ; ve put it through carrying heavy books to school and back
i was in desperate need of a new travel bag this was big enough to carry everything i needed for carry on luggage it is very durable and functional i stuff my tablet in here , my psp , headphones , an extra pair of clothes , a kindle , and a few other things
i bought this when my old one broke a zipper and use it for lugging around my office stuff it holds a notebook , ipad , power cords , books and all my other junk
i loved it it is perfect for me my back does not hurts and makes you carry the heavy books easily . it is of very good quality and has a separate compartment for tablet i would definitely recommend it
it seems to be a common issue from what i 've seen in other people 's reviews but my case did n't fit my computer yes , i do have the dell inspiron model but when i received the case , it was a poor fit i 'm not sure if i just got the wrong casing -lrb- i believe so since the bottom did not have the right placement for the battery -rrb- but it would serve well to double check next time i gave # stars because i was able to return it hassle free and buy a cheaper case at best
i 'm very disappointed i received the case and it did n't fit , i ordered it according to there specs and the case is to small it would be wonderful if only it fits and it 's not worth spending the money to return it so as i said it would be a great case if it fit , so if anyone decide to buy one , make sure you have the size correct
this works really well for my laptop , especially when it heats up love the kickstands only problem is one of the prongs that holds the base onto my computer does n't always stay on , but it has n't been a huge problem yet
i love this case the shipping was great and more importantly it fits my dell inspiron really well please note that it will only fit the dell inspiron model number # ! ! please check the model number and the dimensions of your laptop/ultrabook before buying anyway , the color is great , the case feels sturdy and i am very happy with my purchase thanks ipearl for such a great product
i think that this is a very poor cover for the following reasons the silicon keyboard cover just <unk> over the keyboard , there 's nothing to keep it in place when installed , it completely ruins the mac 's great keyboard feel , and creates awful ridges around around the keys when depressed the top cover fits ok , but the bottom cover attaches very <unk> , particularly on the right side near the hdmi and usb ports the bottom cover protrudes above the bottom part of the mac 's case and i constantly catch my hands and wrists on it ; the problem is made worse because the edges are quite sharp i truly do n't understand how any company could manufacture a product this bad ; if i could give this zero stars , i would as i wrote in the title , it is cheap , plastic junk i did n't have high expectations for $ # and i was still disappointed
it fits great , i do n't use the keyboard cover however trying to type with the keyboard cover is really a pain it has one downside it gets smudges from your hands on the cover , they show up really well and it 's kind of nuisance but overall , fits snuggly , when it 's clean it looks great , if you type fast you 'll wan na toss the keyboard cover however
i like the bottom <unk> the cover fits well i am not sure it is as easy to type on i would probably leave the keypad cover off or remove it if doing as much typing as i do at work all in all i am happy with it
shipping was fast , this was exactly the color case i was looking for it is a nice combination however the keyboard wo n't lay completely flat and the screen protector messed up upon
timely delivery , great price for great products it covers my keyboard and provides screen protector i am happy with it i will order again from this company i saved a lot by not spending money to buy a separate cover for the keyboard and screen , protecting my mac even while i am using it i did spend a lot of time doing my research before i bought this product i am glad that i did my research because i got a great buy
this case and protective gear are perfect for my laptop we use our computer to dj so any alcohol that may splatter never hits the surface of our mac
long distance travel these days is most likely to cause damage to this type of electronic device the macbook was protected # % when security required it to be removed from bag for inspection no crying over scuffs and scratches this time
this bag is poorly made and mine came <unk> no pull tags on either of the zippers , loose threads on the interior of the bag poor quality throughout the buckles on the front of the bag came off the interior did n't seem to fit the bag , much too small the bag is shipped directly from china and is a hassle to return . if you 're looking for a good messenger bag , keep looking
it 's a <unk> it 's not what i was expecting , i 'm not sure why i was n't aware of the size but it 's very small i was n't trying to get a <unk> but that 's what i got
i searched many hours for the right bag and i finally decided on this one i received it in a timely fashion and the overall looks was what i was expecting but the zipper has a major flaw it 's difficult to zip close and open
when i got this bag i was very excited it 's very heavy , and looks really cool it actually looks cooler than it does in the photo , which is sometimes hard to do with clothing i like all the pockets as i need to bring a lot of stuff with me to work however , the downfall is that the zipper broke i never liked that from the beginning , but i had my hope that that manufacturers knew what they were doing using that type it 's the big <unk> type that sticks a lot it finally broke and i do n't believe there 's a way to fix it , which is too bad b/c i really like the bag
i 've been looking for a messenger bag for a few months i knew i should have bought one of the more expensive ones i had seen in the stores it just feels cheap it 's smaller than i thought i almost did n't buy it - guess i should have gone with my gut and never clicked buy it ... oh well , live and
although i think it is nice looking , the straps are somewhat unreliable the metal buckles that enable you to adjust the lenght of the strap bends and lets the straps to <unk> , making the whole bag to fall to the floor when it happens also , after # months of use , the reinforced patches where the strap connects to the main body of the bag are starting to <unk> make note that this is with a daily usage , where more often than not , the bag carries a slightly heavy cargo
the bag is exactly what i wanted . it 's durable and holds my # `` macbook air no problem with room to spare the only issues i have are the two zippers they are those heavy duty , rugged zippers that get stuck a lot i 'm having major problems with mine already -lrb- i 've had the bag less than a week -rrb- and i do n't think it will be long before they give out entirely the only reason i 'm not returning the bag is because i really do love it and i can replace the zipper -lrb- the top one anyways -rrb- also , right out of the box the bag had several deep cuts and scratches in the leather most of them are n't very noticeable but a few are right up front on those two big leather straps if you do n't usually use the zippers on your messenger bags then it wo n't be a problem
it is what i thought it would be i 'm satisfied with the quality so far i began using it daily during the last week of december i gave it this rating because i 'm a little suspect of the interior material holding up with daily use
it looks great and i like it . but when i was back in china , this bag is sold for only # dollars i thought the bag i bought in the us would be better , but it 's the same except the price
i purchased this to transport my laptop back and forth from work i have a padded sleeve so the lack of cushioning was not a concern for me it is very well constructed and durable
i was really a # . # stars the stitching is pretty good -- after a month or so using it as a backpack in college a few seams have come a little loose the quality overall is very good the leather is not a uniform color though overall it is really
i like this bag and was using it to carry around my ipad on a trip to europe were i was afraid of pick <unk> -lrb- although i have n't had trouble with them really -rrb- the only problem i have is the zipper teeth get misaligned and the main pouch wo n't zip up when it does zip up it looks like some of the zipper teeth are just skipped on one side i liked that this bag had an inside zipper pouch for extra security for important docs if i were going to use it regularly i would have to get this zipper replaced
so far i like the bag , it is my lug things back and forth to work bag i am suspect if the zipper will hold up , i have already had some problems
i 've only had this bag for a couple of weeks , but it served me well when i used it throughout my recent vacation there was enough space for my dslr camera and my ipad mini , as well as other things like my <unk> overall , i am very pleased with this product
so far the first # weeks of my travels , the bag is working out very well we shall see how it does for the rest of my trip , # more weeks
the bag is well made and i did n't find any flaws or problems with the zipper or hardware i 'm not sure a # . # & # # ; laptop would fit easily it 's seems a little small but i 've used it daily for the past week and it 's worked well i 'm pleased with the purchase
pay attention to all the other reviews who rated this low because it did n't fit their # & # # ; + laptop well , you 're not very smart for expecting it to it says in the title it fits a # . # & # # ; it also wo n't fit # hardcover books nor a rocking chair neither can you use it to transport # <unk> of orange juice none of that makes it worse of a bag other than some of reviews on here , i 'm really happy with it
i love love love this bag i originally bought it to use as a backpack for when i have classes at my local university , but it has turned into my everyday , go to bag
the bag was delivered way before the estimated delivery time for starters i had been looking for an vintage air force looking bag for some time and when i found this one i was very glad now that i have received it i love it , the overall quality is great , the fabric very thick and sturdy , the leather genuine and smelling great , i love the overall quality of the bag i am very happy with my purchase and will recommend the seller and this bag to anyone by the way , i have not had any trouble with the zippers at all
i needed an everyday bag that would hold my ipad and other every day carries that i seemed to accumulate this is a perfect fit for me , not as large as others but well made and wonderfully comfortable to carry i just used it for a camera bag at my son 's graduation so not only does it meet the need i bought it for but it is versatile as i said i have tried several bags some were too big and bulky , others were too small this one fits my needs
: d love love love this messenger bag very roomy , comfortable , and great quality highly recommend to all great purchase , great price , delivery took no time at all will buy again in different
product arrived quickly and description and picture of product was accurate bag is made extremely well and not cheap , have used it daily for about # months now and no signs of wear and tear purchased this bag for college textbooks but it will also hold my # & # # ; macbook pro but ca n't verify it will hold all # & # # ; laptops very pleased with purchase and would purchase again
it feels sturdy it is holding up pretty well so far , but i 've only had it about a month i love that it zips at the top in addition to having the flap some of the other nice features - each of the front pockets has their own snaps so that you can keep everything secure the shoulder strap has a reinforced section at the top that is also curved to be easier on your shoulder the only thing i have had a problem with so far is the zipper on the inside got messed up for a bit , but i was able to fix it so not a major problem
this bag is fantastic its exactly as i had hoped it would be it works well and holds everything i need it to without it digging into my shoulder like other bag have done in the past
i love this bag perfect size for taking to work , and carrying <unk> , bible , cords , etc . i 'm a # ' # & # # ; guy and i do n't feel girly carrying this thing it 's comfortable to wear , and the <unk> are real leather i would never be caught wearing a & # # ; murse & # # ; or man purse , but this does n't feel like anything more than a messenger bag i 've flown with it , taken it to conferences ... but it is just my everyday bag i highly recommend this
