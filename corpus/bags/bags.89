on the picture it looked like tougher material to me , in reality it feels more like thin , cheap foam also it 's meant for a really thick laptop -lrb- i.e . a laptop that 's # or more years old -rrb- my # . # & # # ; hp pavilion that i bought the summer of # fits with inches to spare on length , and the sleeve really could fit two of these laptops in it i think the sizing would fit a bulky # . # & # # ; fairly well , but now that most laptops are thinner than they used to be , this product really just does n't work well i do like the velcro and that it opens from the top like it does , but i actually have to fold the leftover inches in half to even fit it into my bookbag in truth , i should have returned it and tried a different sleeve
overall , it 's okay most of my complaints are pretty minor , the color is kinda off from the one shown in the picture thought it was going to be a bit more bright green rather than a olive green also , its not as snug as most laptop sleeves are , fairly roomy but i suppose i can just stuff my cord and mouse in there as well
i recently bought this to help protect my laptop , and it 's an okay sleeve while the sleeve is perfect length-wise -lrb- longways -rrb- , there is quite a bit of room width-wise , and thus , it 's not quite as snug a fit as i would have liked it to be however , it is as pictured , and true to colour
bought this for my hp # . # `` laptop i wanted it to fit into <unk> bag , & it is perfect gives protection without all the extras did not need certainly would buy another one if needed
love the bag , well made and my computer fit perfectly only suggestion would be to have a handle of some type on the top to carry the bag when you did n't want to carry it with the shoulder strap other than that ... it 's great
i bought this for my son 's netbook knowing it was too big , but he stores in the front and has plenty of room for whatever else he wants to carry around the quality is nice , very well made and i 'm sure it will last past his netbook and be a perfect fit for a larger laptop one day i might have to buy myself one for the price these are sold
i love this bag the padding keeps my laptop safe and the extra compartments allow me to have my wireless mouse , notepad , pens , <unk> accessories & laptop charger with me , with room to spare this bag is <unk> and holds it 's shape when you empty it out very convinient bag . :
this bag so far has been a hit i love how it looks , the <unk> print is a nice , subtle gray i like the padded insert . . which is where my son 's ipad goes lots of pockets and storage , very roomy adjustable strap is perfect -- my son is a little dude only complaint i have is i wish there was a pocket on the side for a water bottle , like many backpacks have overall , great bag
this is an awesome bag water proof and all love it get one and keep recommending it must get one for your self 's . compartments ez to get at and roomy laptop fits nice and snug
this bag is perfect repels dirt , is durable and i can put my ipad that is also in an otter box in here with a lot more stuff i wish it came in a smaller size but everyone always loves this bag
i got what i purchased the bag is waterproof and elegant , the # -inch laptop fits perfectly i like the military style and this bag is the perfect one for me
fits my laptop perfectly and love the <unk> pattern i 've had other <unk> messenger bags and i did n't like that they did n't hold the form very well or that they had too many pockets * ie , looked way too tactical for my taste -rrb- this was perfect
i love this very <unk> print the bag small for my laptop i wish i were known that it would not fit the # inch laptop i guess i 'm going to trying to use it for one other purpose and if that does not work i may give it to someone as a
the bag is absolutely beautiful and just so you know it fits up to a # & # # ; laptop i know that 's a worry for a lot of people the got va va <unk> pattern and the colors were much brighter in person so that 's something to keep in mind upon ordering the other pocket is deep and the padding for the laptop is just right there 's really no comparison because this bag is just all around great
i travel alot both business and pleasure so for business , i have my # inch laptop . my i pad and my kindle i am always well connected this travel tote is easy to <unk> under my seat on a plane ... easy to carry on my shoulder and still has room for extras . like a water bottle or snack easy going through the tsa check lines at the airport
believe it or not , my # year old granddaughter is a huge fan of all things vera bradley , and she likes black , so she really liked this bag it seems very durable and is wearing well
what an incredibly cool and versatile computer laptop bag ! ! ! ! ! ! it even has a zippered pocket and extra cool pink padded lining that used as a lap desk is awesome ! ! ! i so love , love , love this purchase and so will you no doubts . : -
i love this bag , it is perfect for my macbook pro # the best part it 's that you have room for the charger and personal items and if you need to drop some papers in there 's also a compartment for it i bought the <unk> road and the flowers are amazing i would recommend this bag :
i bought this to carry my mac airbook and ipad back and forth from work the mac fits perfectly and there is room left over for the ipad if i also need to carry that i take this to meetings in other buildings -lrb- i work in a school district -rrb- and there is room for notepad , keys etc as well as the power supply it has an outside pocket and # interior sleeves to keep the devices secure
loved the print and the style of this tote the handles are suitable to my needs i can carry my # inch laptop as well as the accessories and my ipod very satisfied with the
i decided to purchase this bag based on the other reviews and i 'm so glad i did ! ! it 's really , really pretty - the colors are bold , and rich looking my laptop fits great with room to spare -lrb- it 's ~ # . # `` x # . # `` -rrb- the non-laptop compartment is suprisingly roomy it holds the laptop cord , my mouse and a couple folders nicely it is brand new , so i ca n't comment on durability over time , but vera 's stuff is made well
this lovely bag has room for my laptop and extra large pocket i love the outside zipper . very glad i bought this and use it daily for work travelling between schools
the bag fits laptop and ipad just fine , but that 's about it there is no room for power cables or headphones , which i need when i travel so , i returned it also bag came with no strap , but i think i just got a defective order , it suppose to come with strap
this is a very plain laptop bag no frills here , but it does deliver good quality construction and simplicity you do n't have much extra room for other stuff here , though just a laptop , power supply and a few odds and ends
the case is sturdy i gave it as a gift this seemed to be what i was looking for i wanted a protective case and yet not as bulky as many of the cases i had seen the person i gave it to seemed pleased with this type of case i do recommend this one
i carry a # & # # ; laptop and an ipad easily has side compartment for pens , passport , etc . strap is cheap , hooks on end are plastic and squeak when you walk have not had a problem , but build quality just feels mediocre
every is great with this & # # ; attach & eacute ; & # # ; except that the clamps securing the bag -lrb- when in sling mode or across the back -rrb- begin to squeak within a week its plastic + friction i fixed it buy using some <unk> to loop through and secure easy fix + personal touch this bag is a handy carrier for the <unk> out there , ipad users , a few papers , chargers , pens , but mostly i use it to carry my laptop and notebook
picked up this bag for my # . # & # # ; laptop it fits a bit snug with the power supply , you max out your available space and ca n't really fit in much else otherwise , the bag looks great i love the color the fabric appears more dull than in the photo , but it suits me just fine the front velcro pockets are tightly held together in fact they 're so tight that they produce a more audible velcro sound than necessary , which might be uncomfortable for those that work in quiet settings otherwise good quality bag
does a great job protecting an ipad and a few accessories , while remaining light no excess bulk to speak of , sleek and stylish also will fit a laptop of up to # . # inch screen size too many tablet cases lack straps and/or handles , but this understated black number does both right without being overkill
hubby puts his # `` laptop and his ipad # in this case and there 's little room leftover , so keep that in mind if you were also hoping to put a few other things in this bag minimal protection , but my husband does n't make a habit of swinging his laptop case around and bashing into things , so the protection this has is good enough he takes it to work and it looks good and professional , and the padded part on the strap keeps the strap from digging into my neck when i carry it around it 's a good price and it does what it 's supposed to do , and all the stitching and materials are good and sound
i intentionally bought this laptop bag because of its size i travel to a lot of conferences and needed a light , professional-looking bag that could not be crammed with too much stuff this bag does the trick , i just wish it had a touch more room for my laptop cord - i have to get a little creative with how i pack it to make it all fit if i had a netbook , i think this case would be perfect i also love the extra slot for the ipad here 's what i can typically pack in there : laptop , power cord , mouse , notebook , ipad , pens , slide <unk> , and an iphone charger i can also usually slide a magazine in there before it wo n't zip shut
came exactly as pictured and described it could be a tiny bit bigger as the laptop just fits and that is it a <unk> to remove especially in security line at airport
i was looking for a lightweight case that i could carry the my new surface tablet in - take it on a trip , to a trade show , even just to the coffee shop or library it 's great for all that the surface fits in the tablet pouch perfectly room for paper pad , pens , maybe some literature if take it to a trade show , a book for on the airplane perfect for what i want very plain , though some kind of small accent or logo would be nice maybe a red stripe along the side with the zippered side pouch
this bag is perfect for carrying a laptop , but i only gave it four stars as it struggles to fit anything else however at the price ca n't beat the value
a bit smaller than i was hoping for initially , but it works for its stated purpose , with a bit more room than i thought it would have very much appreciate the well-crafted quality and its sturdiness things feel `` safe `` in there ... and that 's not small <unk>
go this for my work laptop , it 's the right size as advertised not too bulky i take a shoulder bag anyway if i have to work away from the office so do n't need to pack too much in enough space for charger and dvds and a couple of folders not much more can fit in there though
i love this bag because it is simple designed bag with decent price except the shipping fees that makes you kinda hesitate to purchase it however , it is worth the money i could n't find any # ' # bag for my laptop that is as <unk> as this bag it has many hidden zippers inside it which makes it super cool i would recommend it to anyone
love the case it holds a # or # & # # ; laptop , snugly but does n't expand widely for chargers , accessories , unless they are flat there is an exterior pocket , but no depth , so good for a phone maybe , pencils , <unk> lightweight which i like - does n't kill your shoulders i keep my laptop in a sleeve inside for greater protection i do like it though and will buy another one just know it 's limited in <unk>
excellent price quality and shipping speed perfect gift for my boyfriend we spent approximately # weeks looking for the perfect bag and we couldnt find it anywhere great deal # % recommended
with the <unk> # by case logic , they have created a well built , and quite useful case for tablet and laptop users the construction is typical of case logic quality , meaning its not going to have any durability issues the case is well thought out in the placement of pockets and pouches this case sports a very handsome look to it , and a nice size carrying strap and handle that support a fully loaded case well without being too bulky or too fragile feeling there really is n't much else to say about it , except that its a well designed case that suits a variety of purposes
this is a very nice case it fits a lot of items , but is light and easy to carry and store when not using i put my laptop , power cord and mouse in the case and still have plenty of room for other items i also thought it was a reasonable price i looked at other stores and it was nicer and less expensive than what i looked elsewhere
it look handy and you can use it even for your professional work laptop can be fit into the inside of bag well & provide better protection due to some punch -lrb- i think cotton like -rrb- packing
its exactly what i was looking for plus extra pockets it fits my macbookpro perfectly with room to spare for an extra protective case it 's not bulky and gets the job done
i needed a case to carry my computer back and forth to work and store some extras and this fit the bill perfectly excellent value for the money and so lightweight and easy to carry have n't traveled with it yet , but i can already tell that it 's going to be a great addition to my travel
this item is very basic , but for the price and functionality its a win it 's fairly good quality and the multiple pockets are very useful , especially in this day and age where everyone has a laptop and a tablet it 's light weight but still provides the cushioning needed for protection definitely would purchase again
i am a huge fan of case logic products as i know the quality is always there it is well made and is sturdy for everyday use fabric is of good sturdy quality , which resists stains and is lightweight has a great open back pocket that allows you to carry documents or anything that you need quick access to
i got this for my son for his birthday really nice and classy looking for the money we liked the option of the shoulder strap or handles it 's not enormous , so check your measurements
i am very happy to purchase this bag for my macbook pro , it is very good in it , there is room for documents as well as a place for ipad or ipad
the cheapest <unk> i could find for my # & # # ; macbook pro & i do n't regret it at all the main pocket is plenty large for the computer , there 's a slick pocket inside for perfectly holding an ipad , and another pocket for holding notebooks go buy one
the bag works well in that is has good padding , nice design and appearance it accommodates my # & # # ; macbook pro , and it has plenty of additional room for necessary cables , external hard drives and a few misc . files i may need to carry from place to place i 'm happy with it
this is a must have for the mac enthusiast who needs a way to transport a macbook pro and ipad with plenty of room for my textbook and folder in other pocket there is also plenty of room in the zipper pouch to store all the cords , headphones , and any additional accessories
the outside flap opens even when there 's a laptop and papers in the main pocket the `` ipad pocket `` on the inside perfectly fits a # . # inch <unk> journal my only complaint is that the plastic parts of the shoulder strap often make a squeaking noise as they rub together with normal use
i do n't have a lot to say i 've had this laptop case for over a year and i really am not annoyed at all by it that says the most there is plenty of room for the charger cords and my macbook retina , plus some notepads and papers if i choose
i have just purchased a new laptop and needed a safe way to transport it this case just fits the need it keeps my laptop safe and secure it has easy to zip zippers and plenty of storage i am very happy with this purchase
the little rubber circles that are on the bottom side of the case completely broke off # days after i got it and the top shows scratches and dirt really easy not happy at all refund or return is necessary this case is perfect if you keep it in the wrapper and in the box the entire time you have it
got the case and after putting it on my air , loved it immediately feels good to your hands and the case itself stays on the air no problem as you open and close it love the way the case looks plain black when closed , and as you open it the apple logo faintly glows through but here 's the problem like a lot of people , i take my computer home from work at night and bring it back the next day by the second time in and out of the bag , the feet had started falling off within a single work week , all four feet were out and you ca n't get them back in by hand , either oh , and the bottom of the case is curved , so now it 's useless - the mac rocks back to front unless you wedge something - a printed <unk> presentation is perfect - under the back edge so the case is a complete # fail , unfortunately
i needed a rubberized case for the macbook air # , and ordered this item , because i did purchase other khomo products in the past i have to say , i am largely disappointed even though the bottom cover sits snugly in place , the top is completely loose there 's only one plastic clip in the middle on the top -lrb- and no clips on either side -rrb- , so sides sway and the whole cover shifts sideways , sometimes by a few inches disappointed , and will be returning this item
yeah , it keeps popping off the tabs the finish is mediocre , and you can tell where the mold attached to the rubber because it looks like it was broken off roughly probably wo n't be using this much
yes , the cover seemed cool at first , but be warned that it attracts quite a bit of marks on the cover that look unsightly also , the tabs at the bottom that stabilize the laptop rip off easily the first one went the first day and the second one a week later at this rate so yes it protects the computer , but does it make look great
the case is sturdy and durable the down side about the case is that the case does n't completely snap in on the front of the laptop final verdict the case is a very good product , its worth the
the case came right on time , and it was easy to put on my macbook air you can faintly see the apple glowing through the case , and i feel better knowing that something sturdy is between my air and scratches and dirt the only downside is that i ca n't seem to get the case off , it 's stuck on there pretty tight
the finish does show finger prints the cover that is on the back of the screen has a tendency to become detached in a couple places it doesnt fall off but once snapped in place i would expect it to stay put
i like the case my only problem with it would be that the top part makes the screen close down at a certain distance if it was a bit lighter it would 've been the perfect case other than that it 's pretty good
fits , easy to install , slightly translucent so i can see my apple logo thru it . texture of material slightly non <unk> <unk> if you balance your coffee mug on it i am recommending it to friend right now
this is the only cover i have used on a laptop ever fyi , but i like this cover pros * the rubberized finish is awesome * it is translucent , so when the apple lights up you can see it through the cover , otherwise it is just black * rubber feet at the bottom * fits pretty well * does not interfere with the ports as i have read in reviews for other products . cons * the cover is a plastic so it does slide a little i was thinking of gluing it with some rubber cement * it is surprising how tight the fit is for # small clips on bottom and # on top if any one of these were to snap im sure that part would be unusable , unless my rubber cement idea works
i purchased this product # months ago and noticed that the corners on all ends , top and bottom , started cracking and chipping then it got to the point where the pieces started to fall off and the seller says it 's too late to return the product or exchange it do n't waste your money , please ! ! ! !
not only was this case , dirty and scratched when i got it it was also way too big and did n't even fit the laptop and now i wo n't even get my money back for the shipping costs ... horrible . do n't get it . even if it fit , it was scratched and dirty . bad quality
i got this for my macbook pro and the top piece snapped on to fit the bottom piece only snapped on near the front and just hung down near the spine i had to return it
so i got the shell case as ordered , it was exactly what i wanted i had it on my laptop for maybe two weeks , including the handy little keyboard protector they gave you as well ... when i noticed my keys were sticking when i tried to type i lift my key protector to find that my keyboard had melted i took it to the apple store and they examined the inside and determined that the heat had come from the outside because the internal of the computer was not melted so they <unk> me at fault and wo n't cover it awesome . # $ to fix a laptop because of a # $ case otherwise , great case
i purchased this case and got it two days later very fast delivery when i went to put the keyboard cover on , i noticed stains on the f , & # # ; , and command keys , also the enter and shift key are rubbing off no big deal i thought its going to get dirty anyway i went to snap on the hard shell and it slid right off . also the bottom was so big the computer might as well swim in it i know i ordered the right size because i was very anal about the description theres no reason this <unk> have fit
i received the product very fast , but it did n't make up for the fact that the case is too <unk> even for my model macbook pro and did n't even come with the advertised keyboard cover super bummed out , not ordering from this company on amazon in the near future
i bought this in january and here it is may and the darn thing is cracked at the corners i 'm not rough with my laptop , it sits on a computer desk i bought this case as a <unk> since i have a toddler and she has yet to do any damage to it i 've never dropped it or banged it the case just started cracking out of no where on the corners , and little pink <unk> of plastic are scattered around my house also the silicone mat is n't what i thought it would be , is pretty loose and puffy around the keys
i was actually looking forward to this hard shell case for my apple macbook pro as one way of personalizing it while protecting it unfortunately , this product was a total <unk> - the pieces did n't fit at all i puzzled over the poor fit thinking perhaps i received the wrong product i would not recommend the gmyle hard shell skin case for the macbook pro # -inch laptop
i got this set for a macbook pro retina early # model # . the bottom piece does n't snap on , way too big for my mac # . the top piece is just ok to be on , but not a sung fit # . the top and bottom covers ca n't snap on together in any way # . covers are hard <unk> , not soft rubber the keyboard cover is what it says and fits well . so you are paying for a keyboard cover and top cover it 's fast shipping , but i ca n't recommend this product please look else where for a good fit macbook pro cover
i love the color and everything came but as i put it on my computer it started to break and crack in the sides wasnt to happy with that but it like the color
i ordered this for my # -inch macbook pro and it is too big for the laptop love the jelly keyboard cover though that 's the only reason i 'm not returning it
we ordered this for our macbook pro and have not been satisfied with the order we were sent the correct color but the top part of the case does not fit trying to resolve this issue with the seller is difficult because they keep asking if our macbook pro has retina display our first email response indicated it did not have retina display but they continue to respond asking the same question we would love to give this purchase the full five stars but the whole purchase is <unk> if the top part of the case does n't fit
the case is n't molded to the exact shape of the computer the right side of the case is crooked and it does n't click on to the top of the computer like it should
did n't last long for me the bottom gets really hot and dose n't breath -lrb- had to leave it off -rrb- the edges of the case chipped and the keyboard cover bubbled up , especially when
the keyboard slip fits over my keyboard well , despite the bad reviews i 've read about it the top cover fits over well , too the bottom piece is what i had the problem with at first i thought it did n't fit i noticed that if you look closely theres two little clips that go slightly over the laptop that 's all that holds the bottom case in place , which does n't do much i also would like to point out that this case is for macbook pro # & # # ; without retina display
it arrived shortly after i made my purchase the quality is not the best the bottom cover did not fit very well and ended up falling off my laptop and broke it did look cute on though
although the case is a nice color and a nice material , it does n't fit my computer right the top is just a bit too small and leaves one side of my computer vulnerable
this little case has served me well but it started to fall apart and crack a few days ago ... it 's been about a year which may be a long time for some people but i expected more color was great no opaque but i 'd say it 's about # % <unk>
i ordered the pastel pink case the color is beautiful , just what i wanted the case fits well and has a nice feel to it i was disappointed to find that the bottom case does not cover the spine of the macbook like the speck cases do the matching keyboard cover is a bit <unk> feeling it 's not silky smooth so typing has been a bit stickier i 'm comparing it to the moshi keyboard skin which is silky smooth , and expensive but worth it overall , it 's a good buy for the money
the bottom piece did n't stay on well at all the top piece was impossible to get off unless it was broken off the keyboard skin make it almost impossible to type i have always had that problem with keyboard skins though it lasts a while , but its hard to get clean - which was why i removed mine it started getting grimy
case was ok , started cracking and chipping in the corners after about # months of use having to look on amazon now for a new case will probably try a different brand however to see if the same things happens again in a few months keyboard cover , made typing slow since keys kept sticking ; bought another brand that seemed to fit the keys & # # ; snugger & # # ; and was much easier to adjust to typing with a cover
this case fits my macbook pro but seems a little off on the top . . however i did get it to fit overall i 've had it for a couple months now and it is holding up i also like the matching keyboard cover that comes with it
i was super excited to get this case ! the color is super cute and exactly what i was expecting i read previous reviews that the bottom did n't fit a lot of the time and when i started to put this on , i was worried that it was n't going to fit mine however , there are snaps that fit on the spine and you have to put those on first after i realized that , it fit perfect and i do n't feel like it will fly off unexpectedly it 's sturdy the only complaint which is n't a big deal is that the keyboard cover does n't match up with the keys very well especially when the backlight is on however , i knew this was a high <unk> when buying the bundle also , the color of the keyboard cover was faded and scratched off on some keys but i do n't really care it 's hard to type on but i can get used to it i need it for protection and i 'm happy
keyboard cover fits great , as did the top portion the bottom did n't fit as well but it clipped pretty good after it was placed firmly for a while there pretty great for the price so it 's recommended
i ordered this one and i did n't know my retina was thinner i tried to return it but that would have been more money then i payed to get it , or close to it so i gave it to my friend she loves it , and loves the color , it all worked out but was a little frustrating
for the most part its a good case for the price i only just received it , so i do n't know how durable it is yet i can say that the measurements are slightly off though i have a # & # # ; macbook pro , and the bottom case is slightly off in size and does n't fit great but i got it to stay and work so i guess there 's that so for the price i think its a good buy , the color is very pretty and the keyboard skin in nice
i chose a # because it 's a little bit hard to get off but that 's good because you want protection and that means it 'll protect it my mac has no scratch marks from the case which is also good , the pink is a lot darker than it is shown in the product photo , which was disappointing because i like lighter pinks
the color is just like in the picture , and the outside is rubberized like it says the only thing i do n't like is that i ca n't get any decals to stick to the case i ordered it with the intent of adding rub on decals , but something about the coating stops them from sticking
my kid loves the color to cover and place on keyboard of her macbook pro it is very easy to place two pieces of cover on the macbook , but the <unk> cover for keyboard is not easy to press buttons sometime it is working to press , sometime it does n't so my daughter wanted to remove <unk> keyboard cover
arrived quickly , just as pictured and fits my macbook pro just fine took a minute to attach the bottom piece properly , start from the front and slide to the back , and it snaps into place
the only reason i did n't give # stars is that the bottom piece does not fit on securely and slips a little overall for regular use , you do n't notice it though the top fits well , it looks great , i love the keyboard cover for keeping out dust and crumbs , and it feels like the battery stays cooler because of keeping it raised a little off surfaces overall great case for a great price
this case is definitely good for the price although after two weeks the corners did start to crack case is a tight fit my bottom right corner pops on and off no matter how hard i try to get it in place but still does its purpose
i love the case so much ! ! it is the most perfect color and the keys feel amazing on my fingers and are so easy to type with it came so quickly in # days way sooner than it was supposed to arrive i am very pleased with the case and it was an outstanding purchase thank you amazon for the wonderful service ! :
i love the color i had an older pink one and it was like a shocking pink color this one is more subtle will sure buy again from the seller
this was such a great product i have been using this for a while now and my computer is fully protected from scratches and i love the color it adds to my computer
