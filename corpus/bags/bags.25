plenty of pockets with great organization designed with durable fabric that will last very comfortable and adjustable i carry a # in macbook pro to work everyday with <unk> and other random items , it works great for walking to and from work and it slim enough to carry on the bus
great backpack . . purchased this for my vacation to the <unk> republic i was able to get everything i needed for the # day stay at the resort this bag was full and was able to fit perfectly in the <unk> compartment and under the seat of the plane i was originally going to buy a north face backpack , but i went for this one ... and glad i did
as with all swissgear purchases i 've made , i 'm very happy with the quality it 's unbelievable how well made this is , especially for the price i paid the fabric is nice and thick and the zippers are heavy duty definitely recommended as a travel pack -lrb- personal bag for air travel -rrb- , and even as a day pack for short hiking trips
overall i like this backpack even though it was a bit smaller than i originally thought this thing is built pretty though where it can double as a nice range bag and/or a mini <unk> bag
you are getting what you pay for here . it 's a great buy and a fantastic back pack i 'm a college student and i can get my hp # inch laptop in perfectly about four note books , and three text books . it fits snug against your back and the padding is awesome
as a christmas gift for a family member at the price it was a solid purchase i would recommend this to anyone interested in purchasing a day to day backpack
the backpack is good the material is resistant the backpack has multiple compartments to carry almost everything it has a special compartment for the laptop of # `` to up # `` it is very comfortable the price / quality ratio is good
i have purchased this back pack # years ago its seen me through grad school , lot of weekend trips and even to trips back home i use it to carry my laptop to work it 's just perfect thank you swissgear :
this backpack is the perfect size to carry my laptop to work it also doubles as my purse it really frees my hands up i love it shipped super fast too
this is a well-made , sturdy & good looking backpack , that fits our # inch laptop well in a padded pocket inside it also has lots of room for notebooks , textbooks , binders , etc . , as well as a <unk> outside zippered section my <unk> grandson loves this & says it is comfortable to wear
bought it as a gift for my gf at first it looked kind of small but it turns out she can actually fit quite a bit of stuff in there and she loves it i also have a swiss gear bag and i also love it if ur shopping for a bag , id def go with swiss gear personally i think this bag could use more pockets but id def recommend it
this is the most reliable and highest quality backpacks ' brand i have ever known when you get this , you will not regret , i can assure you thanks swissgear , for existing
it 's very nice , fit my # . # & # # ; laptop comfortable , all accessories , some books , and many other little things , and still plenty of room only real <unk> would that the front pocket opened a little more there 's little compartments in there but kinda hard to access
i brought this bag based on recommendation on the site , however i feel this bag is not worth the price reasons : this bag is not waterproof my laptop got wet last week there are so many unwanted pockets does n't leave any space to put any stuff i would not recommend this bag
for the most part the construction of the bag feels sturdy , but the left shoulder strap is starting to tear by the seams do not get this bag if you need a lot of space the compartments are very tight and does not leave much room besides # thin text book , # small notebook , and my # . # dell laptop -lrb- which barely fits btw -rrb- overall : decent , but not great
it 's great for carrying around a laptop and books two minor gripes though the side pockets do not hold bottles very well , as the zippers only go up one side of the pocket # any folders , etc . left in the second large pocket will likely be bent slightly
been using this backpack for years now and i absolutely love it . pockets and storage for everything and very comfortable . when this one wears out . . hopefully years from now i will definitely get another one
i searched and searched for this backpack , and was thrilled to finally find it from action packaged , inc. on amazon then in arrived - wrong bag then i contacted the company , they do n't have the right one , and have no idea when they 'll get it this bag looks awesome in the picture , and of all the other bags i looked at on line - probably over # , i chose this one unfortunately , i do n't think it exists ... much to my <unk>
this bag has served me well on numerous flights the pocket for an mp # player was pretty cool , just to keep some clutter out of your pockets while travelling the laptop section is definitely secure and keeps your computer safe my only issue , is that if you only have a limited number of items in the backpack , it is still huge that would be my only complaint so i do n't use it regularly , but when i need to pack it full for a flight , i will use it
this is a nice bag but i was not expecting it to be so heavy i also think that the padded straps are not that comfortable however the bag is durable , has a big volume and will carry your laptop safely
this is a sturdy backpack - it looks like it is built to last an <unk> however , because it seems so durable , it is a bit bulky so if you are a small framed person , this backpack will make you look like an ant carrying a leaf
this is a nice back pack it seems like it will hold up well it <unk> a lot of pockets and a clip they all seem like <unk> will be useful for storing different things
its a great bag with excellent workmanship and build quality my only complaint is that the compartments are not # % separate otherwise , your laptop and all the other contents will remain safe inside its thick cushioned walls and your shoulders will love its wide cushioned straps
bought this for my son who has about # lbs of books to carry and the construction is very durable it also distributes the weight of the pack on his shoulders better with the top attachment being all the way across he states it does not dig into his shoulders like others he has had when this one wears out we will definitely be looking at swissgear for any future purchases
this bag is everything you need for short or long trips with your laptop plenty of organizational compartments very good construction so happy with first purchase that i have purchased a # nd one of these for my husband swissgear is a very good brand
this is a sturdy pack with lots of great organizer pockets and a surprising amount of space its great to use as a commuter <unk> good padding inside in the laptop storage compartment its also very comfortable - even when stuffed completely full great price on this pack from amazon and it was shipped quickly
the swissgear backpack is the most sturdy of all backpacks i saved at least $ # . # buying through amazon verses a retail store if you 're continually having straps break - this is exactly what you need it 's the best
i recently purchased a gateway laptop with a # . # `` widescreen display originally i also purchased a neoprene sleeve to store the laptop but quickly realized that this was not going to work well for transporting the laptop and related accessories found the swissgear bag at amazon for considerably less than anywhere else , in fact it was only a few dollars more than the neoprene sleeve after a few weeks of use , including an international trip , i am extremely pleased with all aspects of this purchase the backpack is a bit heavy but i think that speaks to the quality of construction and all the zippers the laptop fits perfectly in the well padded sleeve as others have noted , the main compartment dividers are not attached at the bottom but i find that to be an advantage as it allows me to pack items of varying size besides , there are so many sleeves , pockets , pouches , etc . , it is easy to find a place for everything just like a swiss knife , it seems like i find a new pocket or storage area every time i use the bag all of this with great packing and timely shipping by amazon , it does not get any better
this bag is rock solid it seems heavy to pick up , but the design makes it <unk> on your back lots of pockets with <unk> sizes make for easy and strategic storage side pockets with straps are perfect for securing water bottles and soda cans my # inch macbook -lrb- last generation -rrb- does fit into the laptop section with enough <unk> room to spare ; however , it does not fit perfectly into the padded sleeve , not a big deal
my youngest just started college , which required a large number of purchases he did n't want to carry around a <unk> bag like other members of the family , and when we began searching for a computer backpack , this type was recommended by one of my husband 's co-workers when it arrived and my son found all the various compartments and how well-protected his new laptop would be , he was delighted the built-in lumbar support should be a requirement , as far as i 'm concerned , on every backpack carried by a student and the padding on the straps is also extremely well-constructed the additional cellphone pouch on the strap , outside the pack , is also a convenient perk for the number of compartments , the construction , the materials and configuration , i think this should be at least in the top ten products of this sort , if not the top five it 's terrific for a college student , and would also work well for someone who commutes using public transportation or simply needs to carry a laptop in a convenient way
i bought this bag a couple of years ago and have been very pleased with it it is well constructed using quality components and materials i have seen similar swiss bags for sale at other places , such as costco and they are clearly inferior in quality to this one
this swissgear backpack is great it 's actually larger than i expected and has room for everything i need to carry based on the quality of others items from this company , i expect to be using this bag for years
the style is ok but the color is different to that of the advertisement . at the same time , when i just used it for one week , there is a little <unk> i feel <unk>
bought this backpack to replace a targus laptop backpack i used for # years this backpack although very roomy and good looking -lrb- blue -rrb- fell apart in less than # months i use a backpack to sling my laptop back and forth to work and use it while traveling - moderate use will not buy a swiss gear product again i 'll stick to the targus brand
i 'm the mom of the middle school boy that uses this backpack we are going on three years and it still looks pretty new considering that i used to have to purchase one a year and sometimes more than that , it is well worth the extra money my college age son also has one in red that we got at the same time guess what , still looking good good compartments and i have not had complaints from them it is also much more comfortable than the less expensive ones i purchased in the past with all the books they have to lug around -lrb- and a laptop -rrb- comfort is important
this backpack is perfect for my son to take his laptop to and from school the quality is exceptional - the zippers are very rugged and you can tell that it will take a lot to wear them down there are enough separate <unk> compartments to separate his books , pens etc . . . from the computer area there is also the separate compartment to put any wires , headphones etc . . so far , we are very pleased
it 's been a few years since i 've had a back pack i was using a sholder bag for a long time , but it just got too heavy i ordered this bag because the price was right , it has lots a space to store things and i 've seen a lot of other people with swiss gear bags so far i really like it it has plenty of space for all of my junk and i like the way it looks too the one small -lrb- very small -rrb- complaint is that the zipper on the front <unk> area is n't as smooth as the rest of the zippers not that i ca n't use it , but it 's just sticks a little bit over all i would buy this back pack again
i purchased # -lrb- two -rrb- of this backpack for my daughters they love it very much its really comfortable and has lots and lots of pockets the quality of this backpack is really surprising for the price i think its better than jansport good bye jansport
i 've been using this backpack for my dell computer and photographic gear when i travel it has the right mix of different sized compartments , a padded area for my # `` dell , style , and comfort i 've owned and used many backpacks over the years and this one is by far the best i keep thinking about buying another one , but this one shows no signs of wear -lrb- and i pack it full and treat it rather badly -rrb- so i expect it to last for years more
this bag is the most price competitive i could find it is a bit too small however and i have to remove one of the end pads to allow the # . # inch laptop to fit into it otherwise it is great
it 's a really simple fabric bag , paid $ # for it , nothing fancy material seems to pick up dirt easily strap is lightly padded as described . `` plenty of room for accessories `` is a slight exaggeration power cord and mouse fit , but look bulky . some room for papers up front not sure if the person i got it for will like it
this bag has enough space to carry your average laptop and a charger also has a pouch for some other accessories there was also enough room for two large paperback novels when i traveled this was an <unk> solution for someone who does not carry their computer daily it may not be durable enough if used every day , but it is great for occasional or weekend travel
i bought this as a gift the price was right and the delivery was quick the person who received this gift said that they truly enjoy it and that it was a perfect fit for their new lap top
i bought two of these for work computers that will be used in the field the bag is very basic and thin in width the bag material is good and seems durable there is really no extra room in the bag for storage which is okay for what the office needs
its probably one of the smaller bags that is an actual bag with space to carry a mouse and a few extras if you are looking for simple , this is it
i 've had this bag for a couple of months now and i really like it it fits my # `` macbook pro perfectly , with room in front of it and behind it for papers , folders , etc . i 've also been carrying my tablet in the front pocket , so plenty of room without being bulky
it fits my toshiba lap top perfectly it has room for adapters and additonal cords i was able to place some folders and other supplies in the bag along with mu <unk> the strap is adjustable which works for me i would recommend this notebook carrier
it is just what i needed this case allows me the luxury of not having to carry my backpack around everywhere i go i can securely take my laptop with me and a couple of more items in the pockets of the case thanks so much
does n't fit my eee netbook have the exact netbook described , but it does n't fit not even close not wide enough will be returning too bad , because it does look and feel ok
this computer sleeve was advertised as being able to accommodate up to a # / # size netbook i have a tiny little acer # . # screen , and the sleeve was way to small
i purchased this sleeve for my # . # `` netbook the sleeve is too small ! i even took the battery off the computer and it still does not fit it 's too bad because the product is really nice but not as advertised
i bought this `` be.ez -lrb- # -rrb- la robe sleeve for eee pc `` to use in a different application than the eee pc as a <unk> network security consultant i travel a lot and when i do , i like to bring an srx # with me in case i need it during a project as a be.ez la robe fan , i was looking to find one of their products that would allow an srx # services gateway gateway to fit the srx # services gateway fits snugly as if this case was designed for the srx # =-rrb- very satisfied with the sleeve and the be.ez protection
i received this case about four weeks ago and overall it is sturdy and rugged my # inch thinkpad fits very nicely as to my business cards and and portable scanner my only complaint is how overpriced this bag is us are essentially the same bag by targus in case logic for about $ # as opposed to the # i paid for this bag it does n't even have the words thinkpad on however lenovo <unk> this is one of their approved bags my advice is not to waste your money on this bag but look at <unk> in case logic
at any one time i have multiple thinkpad computers with me this case carries the computers and all of my gear efficiently and most importantly safely i really like the little sleeve in bag allowing it to slide down onto the handle of my carry on
perfect for me i would n't really get anything else this is well-designed , padded , very useful it fits my thinkpad twist well it is n't as small as just a <unk> thing , it 's a real briefcase sort of thing , but very happy with it
great bag , fits thinkpad # . # & # # ; very well , has a lot of room for expansion and it is very light , offers medium amount of protection for sides but has great bottom protection i removed the strap right away and used it as regular bag front pocket is large enough to fit small boxes , adapter , mouse etc .
i wanted an thinkpad <unk> bag for my trust thinkpad z # t and this fits the bill my # . # `` z # t fits snugly and there are plenty of pockets for accessories , including the tablet -lrb- xoom -rrb- i also carry so far it is very durable
nice case on first appearance when i bought in dec # , but soon had chronic problems with attached top strap handle handle is plastic strap wrapped with padding and <unk> fabric sleeve ends of strap are attached to holes in plastic top of case on # rd use the nut came off one of the attachment screws never found the nut and i was <unk> on <unk> trip with a computer case with no handle or shoulder strap husband was able to repair with new <unk> , but on next trip the zipper holding the cover on the thin plastic handle separated spilling the padding and making the handle almost impossible to use i 've contacted codi for warranty repair , but even if they follow through , i 've still had to buy another case to use in the interim should have bought a better case in the beginning
this case was just right for travel on a plane i recently took a two week business trip with the case and upon return home , i continued to use the codi lite case for a few more days yesterday , i took the case from the trunk of my car and set it on the parking pavement i pulled the handle up in preparation to walking to a business appointment my surprise was that the handle detached itself from the rest of the case i bought the case in april and hardly used the case until this recent business trip is the detached handle an exception or do all codi bags share an <unk> weakness at the handle
the perfect rolling brief fits down airplane aisles , under seats , and solid handle for smaller bag or handbag - three criteria for many women who travel a lot lightweight , a plus
not sure why there are n't that many reviews of this product this product is solid if someone is looking for a laptop bag for office use and day trips , this is an excellent choice i have a # inch macbook pro and it fits in this perfectly and leaves so much more room for all the other accessories and paperwork - solid built - roomy -lrb- looks small but it is quite roomy - has lots of pockets and compartments to organize your stuff - its so small i bet it can fit anywhere - the handle is sturdy - the wheels are sturdy - lifetime <unk> - does not come in # wheels i hope they make one available in # wheels
my husband commutes into new york city by bus daily and walks a lot from the bus stop to his office he needs a bag that holds up -lrb- which most do not -rrb- to banging around city streets and is compact enough to fit in over head areas of a commuter bus this bag fits the bill it seems very sturdy a great find !
i got this some months ago but have only used it very moderately at the beginning i was excited about this product because of the brenthaven brand name , the looks , and the quality of the product -lrb- or at least i thought -rrb- the deal breaker was the quality of the straps the left strap got <unk> for absolutely no reason , which has opened my eyes to the cheap quality of the material -lrb- at least on the straps -rrb- the reality is that the fabric is very thin on the straps which is why it got teared apart i can now see the padding inside the strap , and i 'm afraid of using the backpack anymore because it could open a bigger hole on the strap i hate dealing with returns especially when i have to pay for the shipping and everything , but i will definitely be contacting amazon and/or brenthaven about this just my # cents
the top handle stitching broke within a month had to pay to ship it back to washington for repair , going for a week and a half with no bag after i got it back , the same thing happened again a few weeks later -lrb- this time on the other side of the handle -rrb- sent it back again -lrb- again at my expense of cost and time -rrb- once the seam <unk> like it has , it starts ripping down the length of the rest of the seam , at which point it 's only held to the bag by weak stretchy material that will soon rip itself they would not refund the item -lrb- after # days from the date of purchase -rrb- , only repair , replace , or maybe exchange i only carry my macbook pro in it -- i do not abuse the bag i have reinforced the top handle of this third bag myself by wrapping it up in duct tape the rest of the bag is good
this pack is typical brenthaven quality but it 's very small after i put my macbook # `` in the pack , there is basically room for a couple of files and some small accessories it will not stretch to fit more if i could buy again , i would try to get one with a little more room everything else about the pack is good
i bought this for my small notebook , but i forgot that they measure on the diagonal and not width so of course it did n't fit my notebook computer but i really liked the color now i use it for my nook
i have several different neoprene sleeves for # `` netbooks this one is smaller and thinner than any of the others both the asus eee # and eee # a fit , but just barely the following sleeve from amazon is larger , thicker , and much easier to use : http / / www.amazon.com/gp/product/b #
ordered # sleeves from # different vendors . this vendor delivered fast and in good condition but it does not fit the asus eee net book as described now i have to return and will be short a christmas present
just a bit large for my specific application -lrb- dell mini # -rrb- , but does the job of protecting the netbook nicely would really like a flat power supply , but that is in no way the fault of kroo outside pocket does hold the power well
i find this adequate to protect my laptop when i carry in the carry or pack in a suitcase for a trip the charger fits in the pocket but it would n't take a larger charger
the eee already comes with plain black a cover however , this one is quite nice so , i 've upgraded it 's slightly thicker and thus feels a little safer , brighter and easier to find , and has a pocket in front for the cord my only wish for this product is that i wish it had handles
this is a good , basic sleeve to protect your netbook i purchased it for my dell mini # and it works fine no room to spare for accessories , but a sleeve is really just for protecting the unit so it serves its purpose the outside pocket is too small to hold anything more than a memory stick or flash drive
this case fit my # . # inch acer netbook perfectly service was prompt and quick the only reason i am giving # stars is that if you put your battery adapter and cords in the outside pocket it is a bit bulky and tight to fit i have an extra bag to carry my adapter and cords so that my netbook case is n't so bulky overall , i 'm pleased with this product love the red color -- ca n't miss where you put your netbook is
i was so excited when i received this because it is well made and compact unfortunately it does not fit the acer aspire one with the # cell battery the dimensions under the item description is not correct it will fit the smaller asus but because it is made well , i have returned it and ordered a bigger one as well as the plain
this fits and protects my laptop very nicely i would like a little more storage space , but i did n't want a big bulky case , so the trade off is worth it to me it fits perfectly in my backpack with my other school stuff
the only issue i have is the location of the tag it frequently gets caught in the zipper as soon as i removed it everything about it was great the color is more a hot pink than a magenta , but i prefer that it 's not an overwhelming color at all the case fits well , and the pocket is in a good location
i purchased used one based on the description however i can not carry this one to take my laptop or office books because it is too worst i have worst experience with this seller because he rejected to take return . he did lie and simply said it is in good condition however it has so many ugly deep scratches in almost all the faces . selling this to me is a <unk> i would like to talk to customer care of amazon fully unsatisfied ... waste purchase . not able to use though this is branded
i have had many of these bags they are my favorite to use when traveling with my laptop and notebooks , cables , headphones , pens , etc . i have <unk> up over # , # air miles flying with these , and i know of no bag that used to do better in this role the problem is , the design for the telescoping handle has changed over the past few years , and this new design is bad the handle is difficult / impossible to fully extend , and equally difficult to fully close i 've had # of these in the past # years with this problem the handle wears out -lrb- or fails -rrb- far quicker than zippers or wheels do i 'm done buying this wenger patriot rolling case , and switching to another model
i 've had this bag for several years now and really love the design and features my issue however has been with the durability the bag is really showing wear quicker than anticipated and the handles are impossible the metal screws constantly loosen thereby preventing the handle from been lowered this usually happens as i am on board trying the put the bag in the overhead and have to stop and <unk> just enough to get the handles down the handle is also much flimsier than i imagined it would be the `` other `` swiss army bag , while more expensive , has a better handle design and is more robust
loved the functional layout , but quality is lacking poor design shows in weak handle and front foot handle does n't lock in place easily - at # ' # `` , i have to <unk> up on handle several times to get it to lock in place worse is the front foot the bag leans forward and tips over unless well balanced with heavy items in the rear compartment very disappointing since i think the interior is laid out well for packing laptop , cables , files , and one night of clothes wenger engineers need to take another look and address
this bag 's handle is made of many pieces that are screwed together after a few months , the screws come <unk> and the handle no longer retracts this is the second we 've purchased and the same thing happened to both
i received this case new from work and it served the purpose wonderfully for about six months there are four little screws on the top of the telescoping handle ; two of them started loosening at first it was n't bad , i would just <unk> them at the end of each day , but then it got worse and it seemed they would loosen at the drop of a hat when they became loose , they prevented the telescoping handle from collapsing , creating a big hassle when you 're in a rush becuase you have to stop and <unk> them sure there 's a warranty , and they 'll repair the screws , but you have to ship it to them and then enclose a check for an additional $ # . # for return shipping who wants to deal with that now i 'm in the market for another case ; although this time not one manufactured by wegner
have n't had the bag a year yet and the stitching is coming out on corners of case i do n't use it enough for this type of thing to happen contacted the company and only a # day warranty
it works , but you may want to look for something better i purchased the rolling case a bout # months ago - i travel about # times per month the wheel already show signs of wobbling it is an ok case , but not more
its very large and roomy , unfortunately not ideal for walking into the plane with its too wide to roll down the aisle it is oversized and wont fit in most overheads when # filled great for non airline travel it would be better with # wheels as it has a tendency to roll over when being pulled leaving you to drag it quite often i wish i had not bought it
i just received mine and used it for my international travel it actually rolls with quite an ease what i am worried about is the the telescopic handle is wobbly if someone could let me know if this is a design issue or my bag needs to get fixed i have read some great reviews as well as some that complain on the wobbly handle can the handle be adjusted to be sturdier if not for the handle , i will give a # star i am <unk> with it i checked some <unk> and samsonite and targus bags and did not find it that wobbly
purchased this for my husband to replace his worn out case he liked the look and ability to put so much in it his job requires that he fly commercial airlines often the case does not fit under the seat in front and if he is on a commuter flight -lrb- smaller plane -rrb- it does not fit in the overhead either if you do n't need to fly , this bag is great it is sturdy , looks professional and rolls smoothly
shipper was great , product not so much excellent storage space but cheap quality zippers do n't zip every time the collapsible handle has a lot of play and you can practically twist the handle # degrees wheels already feel like they are starting to wobble it will get me but for now but do n't expect this bag to last a long time of you are a frequent traveler
i make lot of domestic and international trips for my job i have had another wenger trolley -lrb- # year old purchase -rrb- this one is ok , but did n't meet my expectations the older one has been going very strong the main issue for me is that the handle bar is very flimsy out of the two <unk> i have i still prefer using the one i bought # years ago
excellent built quality can easily accommodate two laptops + large amount of paper work detachable bag very versatile only note that last compartment is too thin for some accessories storage is also very limited to between rolling bars still overall excellent bag
the wenger rolling case is as described , perfect travel <unk> for overnight or # day business trips lots of storage compartments and sections to keep your clothes , documents and travel accessories secure and easily <unk> the addition of the # nd bag is very useful and at times serves as a small briefcase the retractable handle seems delicate and i hope it will last for # years
the bag was packaged with the right size box this bag had enough space for my laptop , documents and a some clothes for a two day trip the bag looks sturdy though the handle is a bit shaky but that is normal it 's a little big for the overhead luggage on a domestic flight but it will fit on an international flight luggage compartment will recomend this to a friend
this rolling suitcase offers all the room you could possibly be looking for when thinking of something to take to work it 's good quality and sleek , but even empty , it 's hefty , let alone when you start adding weight i wish it were easier to carry when i do n't want to feel silly wheeling it behind me , but i guess i got what i was asking for when i sought out something this big
had the wenger backpack for the last year , and since i 'm a # year old , it probably was n't the <unk> choice for my back and shoulders in fact , started to have neck pain loved the backpack , though , and even though i 'm a road warrior , it showed no signs of wear so i decided to give this a try so far , it 's been great others complain about the extendable handle , but i like it i 'd buy it again , and would recommend it to my friends
hello all , this is my second patriot bag the first lasted me for about # years , i used it daily and i extended the handle and <unk> it at least # times a day the first bags handle finally broke after # years of daily use -lrb- i was happy with it lasting # years -rrb- i decided to get another just like it when i received the new bag i noticed the handle was redesigned -lrb- this is what broken on my last patriot -rrb- and i was happy to see that however , this bags handel will not stay fully extended when i extend it fully and it seems as thought it is locked in place , it will drop down to the next <unk> # % of the time -lrb- if you know what i mean -rrb- not super irritating but i think its worth the money i spent even though the handles slides down sometimes . http / / www.amazon.com/gp/product/b # e #
so far this bag is great have been on one trip and it functioned very well kept my # in laptop in separate case and stowed the bag as carry on -lrb- it holds # in inside main case -rrb- no more $ # + round trip bag fees on short trips why did n't i think of this before long term durability <unk> but if you are not checking the bag , it 's in your care , right i could see if you ran up against an odd rolling situation with the case how some items might fail this is probably not the suitcase you 'll see advertised with a gorilla handling it good price , nice case
i can fit many things i need for my trip . it 's just a little thick after you put too many things in each pocket it is hard fit into some of the smaller <unk> of airplanes other than that , it 's a solid bag for daily use
i love it its attractive , light and durable lots of pockets for organizing i there is room in telescoping handle enclosure to store computer cords , i store a raincoat in uncertain weather in the travel compartment there is plenty of room for laptop and files and a lot of pockets to keep thing organized
i bought this after # years with a us luggage bag without wheels i 've had this for about # month and have traveled only twice with it i could use more a few more compartments , but overall it has met my expectations i view it as my mobile office , so i leave it in the car or the hotel room and just take the inner laptop bag to my customer visits my ideal bag would have a few more compartments in the inner bag so my files would go with me , but i can squeeze a notebook and one file into the laptop compartment the <unk> document pouch is perfect for receipts and boarding passes the bag will carry on even on regional jets and i 've squeezed it under the seat on full size planes i tend to load up pretty heavy to be prepared for international travel and a bag any smaller would not work if you are n't heavily loaded , i could see putting a change of clothes and leaving your roller bag behind for a one night domestic trip
i travel a lot for work , always carrying my notebook , business papers , some clothes for a one night hotel stay together with a book for the airplane and some headphones carrying this in a normal handbag is possible , but i got so tired of lifting # kg though airport after airport i have looked a long time for the perfect bag , and this is it i have now used it for close to # month , and i enjoy it every time i <unk> through an airport it is well though out in every detail , and holds perfectly up to abuse the balance with the handle is absolutely perfect , when i am going with the bag , it balances by itself , and i can literally go through an airport with just one finger on the handle best purchase in bags i have ever made
