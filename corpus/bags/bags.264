this was an excellent purchase relatively inexpensive , good construction , and a head turner the case compliments all of my business suits nicely and even goes well with my casual wear without being over the top it is really hard to beat the price of this case since it is silver scratches are not nearly as visible as they are on my black case i will forever more opt for the silver unless i can guarantee better treatment but who can do that
i tried using it once . it was floppy . it smelled horrible . it had a terrible texture . i had hoped for better , and it seemed like a good product , but for me it was not
first off , when i received the case it it said -lrb- # `` perfect fit netbook sleeve -rrb- i was skeptical at first but when i put my # . # inch acer into it , it was a really tight fit i 'm guessing it 's more for a # inch but my # . # inch fit very tightly overall it 's a good price for what you get
this item is very protective of your chromebook lots of modern padding and an extra pocket where i sometimes put my kindle fire it 's weakness is that it has no handle or strap to hang it on something else , so it has to <unk> one of your hands or be tucked into another carrier i like it ; it 's well made it 's ok for the price
the roocase seemed to be the best buy when looking for a case for my chromebook you sure ca n't beat the price i was a little worried that it would be a tight fit , but it actually worked out perfectly
this is a well built case , but it is actually # . # & # # ; - even labeled as such on the manufacturer 's label , but is sold as # . # that 's not a huge problem , but it is not as snug as i might have liked for my # & # # ; netbook it was a great price so not worth returning the seller needs to <unk> the product as their sticker on the item said # . #
good case for the money it is actually for a # inch laptop but gets the job done just fine , just does n't fit my # . # snugly the inside memory card holder is not sewn well and will eventually fall out but i was n't going to use it anyway overall a good
got this for my acer c # chromebook , it 's a little big on the inside but protects it just fine i like how much room there is in the little front sleeve for a charger and a mouse
really quite a nice case and i got it really fast fits my samsung chromebook pretty well it is about # & # # ; deeper than is really needed so it is not a snug fit but will work well especially for the price
i got this for my new google chrome book -lrb- arm processor -rrb- and the thing fits great and is well padded this case is really nice and the price was great too
this item was very useful and sturdy . it has good cushion s inside so that your computer is safe from scratches . basically everything is true as it states
this organizer is a bit larger than i expected but it does hold a lot my only complaint is that once it 's unzipped , everything can fall out ; there 's nothing to keep everything in place i will be using it on an upcoming overseas trip and i do like the fact that all my electronic accessories can be kept in one place
pros : nice product for storing laptop accessories and keeping them organized has # decent size compartments to store items such as a portable external hd , mouse , adapter cords , etc . because the item is neoprene , it stretches to fit over odd size accessories cons : because the compartments do not close , it 's best for bigger items but not for smaller items -lrb- such as a flash drive -rrb- those items easily fall out when you unzip the organizer which does not seem like too big of deal but over time becomes annoying overall this a good organizational product and i would recommend it if you want something easy and convenient to store your laptop accessories
i was n't sure about this , but i really needed a way to keep all my chargers and cables together when i traveled and had been using a ziplock bag it actually is great holds everything i need it to the only thing i would like to see is a bit of elastic at each little opening , to keep things securely in other than the occasional charger falling loose it works great
i purchased one for myself several years ago and i use it all the time it holds much more than you would expect i use it to hold all my pc & phone cords and accessories i bought this one for my niece after she saw mine it is so convenient and flexible the fabric stretches it can hold larger items such as adaptors or just lots of items i highly recommend this
i bought one of these in pink to carry all my electronic cords , batteries , etc . when i travel fits right in my carry on bag and i never lose anything started using it at home for the same reason always know where everything is when my granddaughter went to kenya on a medical <unk> trip , i gave her my pink one and got another one for myself now this one will be my go to travel bag as i have let her keep the pink one to take to college they are fantastic , take up so little space and light weight plus holds an incredible amount i have all my hook ups for my camera , ipad , and ipod along with chargers , batteries , and cards recommend to anyone
i read the reviews on this case and decided to order , not sure what to expect i actually purchased a kindle sleeve from amazon last year in the <unk> dot pattern and thought it was really cute so i went for this one as well i am really happy with it , although i have yet to purchase a built product i do n't like well , its just perfect for all my cords , chargers , etc . , and my cell phone headset even fits in the case as well ... what 's not to like ?
this bag fit my macbook # inch perfectly i love the messenger bag strap the only dislike , is that the internal color is more <unk> than the red it appears to be in the photo no big deal , though , because the sturdy neoprene makes up for it i recommend <unk>
this case is perfect it is secure , lightweight and best of all , it stretches to fit a lot more than you 'd think it 's a bit snug when you first start to use it but after a few days it `` gives `` just enough i am able to fit my laptop , mouse , phone and charger without any difficulty
this fits my sony labtop perfectly and because it expands , i can throw in other things if i like the side pocket is also handy i 've had it at least # months and it has held up great
it has lasted this long , and has been a great addition i bought it after i dropped my laptop that cost me over $ # to repair , and this was a small investment that could have saved me a lot of money i would highly recommend it it 's not bulky , but has enough protection that you do not have to worry
what i wanted in a laptop bag <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> bag is not waterproof nor bulletproof it 's basically a sleeve with a handle rather than a completely protective laptop i make sure that i put my laptop bag into a waterproof bag if it 's raining i carry and set this bag down with care and i 'm happy to do that fits my # & # # ; macbook air well the inside is a bright , <unk> <unk> orange which was a little surprising -lrb- i thought it would be more <unk> . i think it will wash pretty easily by hand -lrb- i have n't tried that yet .
i have a # `` macbook pro , and this case worked well until i added the speck protective skin to my mac now that it has the skin on it , it does not slide easily into and out of the portfolio but , i still intend to use it
bought this for a macbook pro and love it it 's a snug fit , but also has room for cords in the front pocket also , i 've gotten tons of compliments on the print
this is , in my opinion , the perfect laptop case it 's feminine , protects well , has extra pocket for cables , and adds virtually no extra bulk or weight the removable shoulder strap can be tucked in the outside pocket when not being used or just left behind , i tend to use it with just the handle i carry my laptop around a lot and have always felt that it is well protected i have also received many compliments on the print i am a fan of built products and use their camera case as well they are n't hard sided so you wo n't get that level of protection but for day to day bumps and dings , this is a great way to protect your products
soft , pretty , functional - what more could you ask for in a laptop case my macbook pro # inch fits easily in the case i use the pocket for the cord , my keys , and some pens papers and a notebook fit easily in with the laptop when i need them it has nice cushioning to keep the laptop safe and i like that it has handles and a shoulder strap - very versatile
i bought this for my sister as a gift she does photography and needed a lightweight , non-bulky bag that she could carry her laptop around in she loves the strap or handle options it is perfect for her to grab and go she also loves that it is machine washable - bonus she gave it two thumbs up
it looked great when i put it on , but if you remove it and try to put it back on it will look bad with wrinkles and creases in the leather i would recommend it if you plan on leaving it on your macbook forever if not , do n't buy it definitely not worth $
i bought this for my macbook unibody and never took it off since then i do n't know what it will look like underneath ... i do n't think i ever will ... but hopefully it 's not sticky i bought <unk> to avoid my computer look like other peoples whose starts turning <unk> and other nasty colors after a while so far it 's been fine it really is leather so it does n't look like cheap crap : -rrb- my only issue was putting it on i tried my very best and there are # <unk> in it : -lrb- oh well it does the job kinda expensive though
i love it typing is so much for comfortable , the color is really nice . it was pretty easy putting it on . i cleaned macbook well and went step by step
this <unk> was exactly what was advertised the texture is smooth and soft while placing it on my macbook , i found it easy to <unk> and adjust the product i have a few wrinkles in the product because i pulled too much when i was trying to place it , but they are n't too visible so it 's not a big issue overall , i 'm very content with this purchase
this is something that i needed to make my macbook much more comfortable to use it keeps your palms from getting sweaty and prevents wear and tear on the computer from frequent use the only thing i worry about is how to get it off , because once it is on , it 's there to stay but hopefully it will come off one day for now , i love it too much to even try
this jacket fits a microsoft surface well it also has a dedicated pocket to fit a smart phone , a zippered pocket that can fit a slim wallet , and an area that fits a netflix disc the only downside i 've experienced is with the strap : the edges are a bit rough and snag easily on wool fabrics
this sleeve is one of the best quality sleeves i have seen it holds my ipad # , with a hard leather case , and leaves about a half - inch <unk> or empty area between my leather case and the sleeve 's zipper i believe the charger and cord would be able to fit although there are other compartments , they 're fairly small and thin but this is exactly what i was looking for - i believe one is advertised to fit an <unk> iphone , and it looks like it will
love this bag for my # & # # ; macbook air great quality and provides just the right protection is n't bulky like a regular laptop bag pockets are big enough to hold charger and my mifi with its charger
i actually <unk> this bag to hold my toshiba thrive tablet -lrb- # . # in -rrb- and it fits perfect even with the case the bag itself is very durable and has pockets to hold extras overall good buy
nice brief case but does not have outside zipped pocket the only bad thing is that i tried to return it back to canada and it was going to be $ # . # <unk> costs to canada i went ahead and kept the bag due to the return costs and will give it to someone else to use
i really like the look of this bag but is n't $ # a bit pricey for this product i bought a <unk> <unk> red croc bag at <unk> for about $ # -- lasted about three years and still pushing it
the briefcase serves its purpose but the material that its made of is of <unk> quality than i expected the price is over priced the color is exactly what i expected it to be
very happy with the over all look of the bag and it 's quality , however wish it had more pockets for pens , eye glasses , passport , ect it has only one zip pocket on the inside it was challenging to organize the things i had from my previous briefcase laptop that had many pockets into this one zipped pocket miss having more pockets
this was a very nice laptop rolling bag ; sturdy and big enough to hold what it needs to , but not too heavy to pick up when going up steps , etc . much more attractive for a lady than most of the ones available that look very masculine the person whom i gave it to as a gift was very well pleased
i really wanted to like this backpack and am sorry to have to return it i need a professional looking backpack to carry my # `` laptop on business and i already have a crew # suitcase to match but , the back pack is just too bulky for me like one of the other reviewers said , it is well padded and does n't squash down , so it sticks out quite a bit from your back i 'm a # year old woman and need something smaller it is very nicely made and i 'm sure would be great for a larger person or if you need to carry a lot in it
nice large main compartment a separate compartment for a laptop this compartment flips open for airport x-ray without removing the computer nice number of pockets and pouches lining is the same used in the travelpro luggage the shoulder straps and handle seem lightweight for the amount of weight a tech person may cram into it the backpack tends to be <unk> without the laptop inside i bought this backpack on the reputation of travelpro , and am not disappointed
awesome for the business traveler i recently purchased after my last backpack was lifted from my car i have not put this one through a full round of abuse yet , but it is spacious and fits nicely under a plane seat that in itself is a huge benefit it is extremely well balanced and has ample compartments
this backpack is very well made and is as tough as it looks the zippers are heavy duty and there is storage galore i decided to return this backpack because it is too thick overall with semi rigid sides it does n't <unk> up into a thinner backpack as some might expect it is almost like carrying a soft side suitcase on your back if you understand that it semi rigid on the sides and you have a lot to carry , then you will not be disappointed plenty of padding for a # inch laptop
this is a beautiful backpack & i would gladly have kept it ... except ... *** it does not fit my asus g # republic of gamers computer . *** although i 'm returning it i 'm giving it # stars anyway , as for any other computer , it would probably be fine
i purchased this backpack to replace one that i had used for two years prior i am not disappointed it is a very high quality product , and is extremely heavy-duty the seams are stitched very well , and all of the pockets are of dense material i have a large quantity of `` stuff `` i carry with me daily , and this backpack holds all of it very well i do highly recommend this product
this is the best back-pack ever seen the plenty of volume they have in the # areas are fantastic as well known manufacturer for pilots , travelpro is a really professional bag manufacturer i had an experience during rainy day and is waterproof
i got this for my thinkpad t # -lrb- refurbished and ordered through amazon -rrb- but it did n't fit well at all too tight for the machine alone , never mind trying to put the charger in
i have a t # and it does n't fit at all in the # w ... the sleeve is too big and the laptop slides around inside moreover , it * stinks * the sleeve itself has a pungent industrial odor which has n't gone away the best thing i can say is that i only wasted $ # -lrb- and my time -rrb- in buying it
lenovo customer service is convinced that the # w fits the t # s i tried the t # s with two # ws and it does not fit -lrb- see the uploaded images -rrb- this product is too short for the t # s i purchased thecase logic laps- # -inch laptop sleeve -lrb- black -rrb- and it works perfect for the # w . i do not recommend the # w
the material is is good quality and the bag seems to be strong but it is not the right size it was advertized for lenovo thinkpad edge e # s but it does not fit this laptop properly the length is ok but the height is at least an inch or more longer than what is required may be this bag will fit another # ' laptop but not the e #
the sleeve is very soft and well made however , it is a bit big for a t # with a regular battery but the extra space is good if you want to put the charger in there as well
this sleeve fits my thinkpad perfectly it is black on the outside and red on the inside both sides have the lenovo logo if you were feeling fashionable you could reverse the sleeve and go red for the day
i bought this to cover up a badly scratched and dented mac-book that i recently refurbished , it looks great however , it gets dirty easily , and the matte finish is chipping and scratched off after a couple of weeks its glossy and shiny underneath , so the scratches are very noticeable it does its job as far as protection however after a couple of months , the rubberized coating has rubbed and scratched off completely on the corners and sides , the scratches look terrible , and it defeats the purpose of having it in the first place the bottom half no longer stays attached , the plastic clips all broke off it adds more weight to my mac than i originally anticipated i would not recommend this product i have friends that have gotten nicer covers
this is a nice case , but it 's impossible to clean both times i 've taken the case off , the plastic grips that latch on to the laptop have broken the case also does n't protect at all against <unk> , so there 's going to be a lot of that when you take the case off -lrb- even if it was perfectly clean when you put it on -rrb-
it 's not bad for the money but does n't quite fit the # macbook pro unibody too well it lasted me about # months and then it broke with one drop
i 've had my speck shell on for about # months now , and have loved every minute no worries about scratches or dents , and it is very easy to remove for dusting i havent had any issues with the screen being `` heavy `` feeling however , after # months the case has broken a tiny bit right by the magsafe power adapter port this is from the new style magsafe plug not fitting perfectly when the cord is coming from behind the macbook its not a major concern , but it is somewhat unexpected i still highly recommend this product , and hopefully speck has updated the shell to better fit the new plug
i <unk> this case on my mbpro as soon as it arrived here in afghanistan this thing has survived the <unk> desert very well and there is not a scratch anywhere on my laptop because of it all of the ports are easily accessible , and the case stays on no matter how many times you drop it the satin finish comes off in the sand a little too easy but overall i am very happy with this purchase
great case to protect that expansive mbp however there are a few complaints that i have # -rrb- the piece of plastic at the corner near the charging port is in the way of the magsafe charger if you flip the charger around -lrb- i cut that piece of plastic off , problem solved -rrb- # -rrb- dirt -lrb- debris , sand , small particles -rrb- gets trap underneath the mbp and can not escape i saw scratches on the bottom of my mbp when i took the case off for cleaning the fit is good and snug the mbp stays put and does not move around inside the case i stick my laptop in my <unk> and the case takes all of the beating instead of my mbp i love the soft touch plastic , does n't get as oily from your greasy fingers
nice fit and does the job , but do n't clean it with rubbing alcohol otherwise , the matte coating will rub off update : the apple logo will show through the plastic cover -lrb- which i like -rrb- and is dependent on how bright you have your screen set the matte coating will rub off regardless over time with day to day use despite this , it still does the job and i am still pretty happy with it
i had some doubts with getting this product after reading reviews , but i went ahead and bought it anyway i 'm glad i did what wonderful protection at a great price ! ! i 'd recommend to anyone
when i purchased my macbook pro i loved the sleek aluminum finish but was <unk> it might slip from my hand in picking it up the speck cover , though it hides the aluminum finish , gives the laptop a more secure feel when grasping to pick it up . it is now # years old and while it has some cosmetic blemishes from use , the macbook pro looks like the day i took it from the shipping box from apple a great product
i noticed that my friend had one of these on his macbook pro for work and ordered one for my macbook this is a great product the look and feel is top notch , but a bit pricey
the item description says mb # <unk> , but the shipped model was mb # <unk> which is the older model had i known that 's what i was getting , i could 've found it cheaper elsewhere
i love this case it 's really easy to snap on and off but it also stays on snug so you do n't have to worry about it falling off i feel much more at ease now that i have it on my new mac and because it 's clear you can see the sweet decal that i got on etsy for my computer : -rrb- definitely a great buy
this case does a great job protecting my new macbook pro while still letting the aluminum case show through i bought the clear one it fit like a glove and does n't add any weight to the computer i just ordered my daughter a macbook and will soon be buying one of these for hers
was unsure about getting a case for the macbook pro ... did n't want to ruin its sleek look , but i am thoroughly impressed with this product it went on easily , has stayed on , and even survived a short fall
i bought this case for my new mbp i absolutely love it i have n't had any issues with it scratching the actual body of the laptop , and for the price , it was well worth the piece of mind i have when using my mbp now i would definitely recommend
this case is perfect for the macbook pro i wanted something that still kept the look of the computer , but protected it as well this see through case snaps right on , and you barely know its there
this is a very nice case it is advertised for a hp pavilion # . # `` but it is way too big the hold down straps do n't even help because it is too big it 's far from a snug fit as others described
i bought it the same around the same time i bought my laptop -lrb- # . # `` -rrb- . i thought it was gon na be a tight fit but it turns out its a bit bigger than the laptop its really fashionable and
when we began looking for a sleeve to fit our new # . # `` laptop , there were not very many options this one seemed like a great find the case is good quality and our laptop does fit , however , it is not a snug fit the sleeve is actually a little too big , and does not fit into a back pack very easily overall , we are happy with the case and would recommend it
we needed a computer case for traveling , and we spotted this little number on line it 's look is very professional , and our # `` hp pavilion g series fits perfectly into it it has straps to hold your laptop in place during travel or when you are using it in the case the padding is very protective , and the pocket in the front is a perfect fit for a mouse pad and mouse or you could even put your charger in there we have no complaints and are glad we purchased this item
one day delivery amazing bag looks great , quality material , trying to figure out how to keep the straps attached to my computer because the bag is oversized but that is ok , its well worth the
this case is pretty great , the design is appealing and the construction seems pretty sound , and i bang my possessions around a lot my hp laptop fits very well and seems well protected i am frequently complimented on a nice looking case , and when i ask my friends who have nice swiss cases they seem to have paid more than twice or three times the amount of this one and this is my longest review ever , so there you go
i could n't believe a laptop case this in expensive could work so well for my wife 's laptop it is built pretty durable and my wife likes the checkered black exterior
big enough to hold my dell m # quality construction , side pouch is big enough for mouse and a/c charger i took a chance on this , was n't sure it would be big enough it 's the perfect size , just a little wiggle room , but sits snuggly in the case for what i needed , it 's perfect adds some measure of cushioning with a sturdy , water resistant outer material overall , exceeded my expectations
this is a great case not bulky and can fit nicely in an overhead bin , under a airline seat , etc . plenty of room for mouse , keyboard , electrical cables in the pockets plus room for files
i love that this bag exactly fits my # inch laptop , without the bulk of a regular computer bag the fabric design <unk> off stains and dings the outer pocket is just right for the power supply and a trackball mouse this is an elegant bag , perfect for just carrying a laptop , when you do n't want or need a big bag everyone asks me where i got this
it is not even worth a penny for the way it has been packed and shipped and if this what we get for money you <unk> for this item , i would surely never go for <unk> # next time and regarding the screen what can is say it has gone to the trash in a weeks time
as soon as i opened the box i knew this was not what i was looking for i had to replace my older screen protector -lrb- which had a real matte finish -rrb- , so i bought this one as the name clearly states <unk> however the screen reflects anything you can possibly imagine , so the only protection you get is from scratches -lrb- if you enjoy scratching your screen with an ice <unk> , this screen cover should help -rrb- not happy at
this screen protector is not anti reflection . thats the only reason i bought it but i guess i got ripped off . i would n't recommend buying this if you want anti reflection
i 'm happy with this purchase it works great got a few bubbles on the side i think because i laid it about a <unk> in too far on one side it 's nice to watch dvds without <unk> distracting me now :
my first backpack purchase in years i guess i expected more and then saw a similar one -lrb- less small pockets -rrb- at costco for half the price everything 's made in china so i ca n't tell the quality <unk> will have to see how this one holds up with use and abuse by my personal handling
we purchased this backpack for our cruise vacation seems like it will be ideal considering it has pockets for id and money , lots of space in the back and a water bottle holder on the side
i bought this backpack specifically for transporting stuff back and forth to work on my motorcycle it was on a special deal on amazon -lrb- which helped -rrb- , but since i 've had it , i 've been amazed at how <unk> and sturdy it is i honestly do n't expect much from purchases anymore -lrb- beyond meeting average standards -rrb- , but i was surprised to find how useful and durable this backpack was i do n't know how better to say that i expected ok and got great i would have no reservations about buying any product from this manufacturer
i bought this for my son for school he loves it it has sufficient compartments for books and other items and the shoulder pads are very comfortable the padding for hte back and the airflow that it allows is a welcome attribute in our hot and <unk> climate the construction appears to be very durable , we will find out when school starts in about a month
the backpack came on time as promised and it looks great my son has gone through so many backpacks for school , we 'll see if this one holds up i 'm hoping it does i 'll write a follow up in the future and let you know how it did
i go to college , and i commute , so i naturally have alot of class supplies to carry around this bag worked like a charm , plenty of space , lots of additions to the bag that allows you to organize everything neatly
liked it ok until the top seam ripped out on a business trip honestly , there are better designs out there , but i was satisfied up until today when the top seam ripped open tha k goodness i have my old swiss gear one handy as a backup , buy it again not a chance
this is a great backpack i would have given it # stars but feel it is missing one thing there is the sleeve for your computer but no other sleeve for your files and note pads do n't get me wrong , there is plenty of room for everything and probably more compartments than you will ever need i just wish it had a sleeve or seperator to keep my files together and seperate from everything else shipping was quick and on time product was delivered as described
this is a nice bag as i expected what i sought was a bag which can contain a lot of things including lap-top , with good looking design i satisfied with both <unk> especially , i like the streamlined shape after using # month with heavy stuff , at this moment , i see no problems
i travel a lot and just started using this backpack yesterday i love all the pockets and fits everything i need easily this is also very very comfortable to wear around with all the stuff in it will update after a few weeks
i bought this to carry my laptop to and from work however , i also do a lot of biking and wanted a pack that would fit snugly if i ever needed to bike with a pack this is a solid pack the buckles are sturdy and keep everything tightened down the strap is extremely comfortable and rugged my only complaint is that the strap sometimes bunches up where it hooks to the bag instead of remaining flat
i 've been using this bag for over # months now i like it there is n't much to complain about the laptop sleeve provides extra protection it has padded shoulder strap to where messenger style it could have a stiffer bottom , but i have n't seen any fraying as of yet plenty of pockets would consider again for my next purchase
i 'm very pleased with this product the bbp <unk> <unk> messenger bag is stylish , has a perfect size and it 's very comfortable i wish i could have more internal pockets , but overall is one of the best notebook bags you can find
i 've had this bag for several weeks now and am very happy with it it 's thoughtfully designed and seems very well constructed the bag rides where a messenger bag should when it 's slung across my back and has enough pockets to keep everything separated the reason i did n't give this bag a # star rating was based on two <unk> in the design the first one is the lack of a key fob most bags i own have one and i did n't realize how often i used them until heading out with this bag the second <unk> is the lack of an organizer with pen loops and the like
very comfortable bag to carry your laptop and other peripherals i fit my macbookpro # `` perfectly in the sleeve , and in addition my power chord , extra cables and external hard drives when i travel , everything packs up nice and tight sometimes i carry my hp laptop and my mac at the same time the side pockets are very useful when you want to separate the things you carry , like wallet , keys , usb keys , cables , etc . highly recommend it to laptop owners that are constantly on-the-go
my computer is a # . # `` toshiba and it feels really snugly -lrb- almost does n't fit at all -rrb- so i know i ca n't store my power cord in there which i 'm annoyed about also i have the smaller hk sleeve that has the ice cream <unk> on it for my netbook and its colors are so much brighter than this one i just wish the pink was a brighter , hot pink than just a regular pink , but to be fair it does look exactly like the picture just way too snug for any laptop over # ``
