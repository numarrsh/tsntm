this is a great storage container for sd cards , but the sleeves are made of # pieces of pressed plastic , and the <unk> edges are weak the first card i put in tore the sleeve , rendering it useless good thing it has several more , but i 'd recommend looking for a <unk> case
there are only a few options for storage of sim , sd and other memory cards - and this is as described the outer material is strong and the plastic is also holding up well but - the smell - <unk> ! ! if you are in even in the slightest bit sensitive to smells or offgassing from products , then stay away from it i am not very sensitive - but the petroleum smell from this case is simply overpowering i guess this is one way to make it `` water repellent `` i have now left it in the sun for a couple of hours to try and reduce the smell - but my guess is that it will take a while so in the meantime , i am using it by keeping it in a ziplock i just wonder , if i feel so <unk> , can you imagine the <unk> of the workers making this product in china or where ever it is made
it is small and compact it has more slots for memory cards , but has an odor that i think it wont go away after a few days it seems like it <unk> out a bit but i think that is from the manufacturer not the seller
positives : so , got the case very quickly and it came exactly as described the case has plenty of space for hd cards and the color matches the picture <unk> : it 's hard to tell from the picture , but the fabric is textured rather than smooth i would have given it # stars but the case has almost no rigidity to protect the cards the ` pages ' for the pockets are all attached at the center , which you can see in the picture , but the pages are stacked the reverse way that i would think they would be rather than sliding the card into the & # # ; front & # # ; of the <unk> , you have to try to get it in the back if you do n't have a lot of cards it should be fine
the case is ok but i was hoping that <unk> that are in the plastic case would fit but they do n't suggest you make some <unk> to accommodate the disk in the case
i like the case i wish there were a way to store the memory cards in the hard plastic cases they come in for double protection and ease of popping one into the camera case
i was disappointed with the quality of the product the very first pocket was ripped when i opened the case there were plenty of pockets left , and i was able to put all my sd cards in available slots , but you would hope that the product would at least arrive with all pockets in tact i only paid $ # for the case , and that is about right for what i got
cheap but effective little case although it wo n't take cf cards like it says , only smaller sd plastic insert may have a limited life as the material is rather thin
cheap feeling and flimsy design and i feel like the plastic pockets for the cards will eventually tear however for the price , it 's a good deal once you get the card in it gets the job done if you just need something to hold a bunch of cards to go with a larger order this would be a good add on
for a very simplistic case , this is what you get very cheap and gets the job done carrying card the static free slots seem a bit flimsy and might rip during times of stressful shooting and needing to swap out cards quickly not water proof the string <unk> on my were a little bit undone upon receiving in the mail . . and i would have contacted the seller , but i doubt they would do something because its such a cheap item the seller on the other hand was fast with shipping . # stars for seller , # star for product
the case serves its purpose i put cards in it so they do n't get damaged i do n't use the case much , it 's just to keep the cards safe ; however , the case really smells i think i 'm going to see if spraying it with febreeze helps
i like this case well enough i wish it had more slots for cards that come with the little plastic case , therefore making a double protection for my cards there are a lot of slots for cards without plastic protection , so that 's great . its a really good size and is light weight
the black card memory case arrived in a very timely manner and will be fine for the purpose it was created for however there is a strong odor that i can best describe as walking into a large store filled with tires i have left it outdoors for # days , and the odor is faint now
this case is just ok it 's very cheaply made but the price was cheap this will work fine for me but i only have couple cards if you have several cards you probably will need a better made one
sd cards fit fine in the small pockets , and the large pockets will fit cf cards , but the micro sd chips are too small for the small pockets , easily slip out then they float around inside the case , waiting to fall out of the case when the case is unzipped not good for micro sd chips i solved this problem by storing each micro sd chip in an sd adapter , which fits snuggly into the small pocket but i would rather have a smaller pocket for the micro sd chips
people really are n't kidding about the strong plastic smell it took several months for it to go away other than that , the case is well-made for the price and it serves the intended purpose
needed something compact to hold the <unk> sd cards i had floating around this is compact and can hold more than a dozen sd cards -lrb- and has a few slots for larger ones -rrb- the card slots are tight , which is okay , and the cards need a little work to wriggle them in i worry about the quality of the zipper though it has n't had any issues , but feels like the cheap kind that may break over time for now , it works fine and does the job
this is exactly the type of case i want but it is a little too snug for the compact flash cards i also think it would help if the pages were a little wider -lrb- i.e . , if you open the carry case like a magazine , it would help if there was a little more plastic in the center this way , when you close the case with a lot of memory cards , there would be more `` give `` -rrb-
there are # larger pouches that are big enough for v reader cards would be more useful if it expanded more and had a few larger pockets for extra credit a slot in each sleeve for a label would make this super
good case for micro <unk> sdhc cards and zippered to keep them from falling out it has # pockets <unk> the size of my thumb and all the rest of the pockets are about the size of my little finger or another way to say it is it has # pages with # pockets each on it and all the rest of the pages have # pockets each only # stars cause i like the pages with the # pockets each on them cause it is easier to get the micro sd cards back out
i find myself misplacing the small sd cards and wasting time searching this will be much more organized so far i just have two sd cards left in their plastic cases which fits in the cf card space the center posts that hold the pages in places are large and make the pockets a bit awkward to access not sure i like taking sd media out of the plastic locking case in order to fit in the sleeve when i locate my other sd cards
device has some kind of chemical smell to it i had to leave mine outside for a few days to let the smell go away also the material is some kind of thin , stiff plastic pass experience with this kind of material -lrb- sometimes used in wallets and cd covers -rrb- leads me to believe that it will be prone to cracking not all of the sd card openings are facing the same way so sometimes you have to flip the case depending on which section you are working in not a bad product but there are definitely better cases out there
this is simply okay as with some others , i find the construction to be less than average , although removing the cards is not a problem -lrb- and i have fat fingers -rrb- the seam on the side was loose out of the box , and i had to secure it with some adhesive there is plenty of room in here for sd cards , which is all i use it fits conveniently in my camera bag , and stays in there most of the time
seems well made size i needed for international travel kit why not # stars ? - smaller rivets would be nice and no cf slots as the big cameras are staying at the office
i had all of my sd cards in little zip lock bags this is perfect love the color the only thing , i wish it had been a little bigger other than that it 's perfect
as advertised , just what i needed for my spare sd cards out on the deer <unk> i keep a spare to swap out with the full ones makes not losing them rather nice
this card case allows for several compact disk and sd cards , which is exactly what i wanted the quality is fine by my standards because i wanted something lightweight and protective of the contents the inserts are a little tight , which is good because it holds the cards well however , it 's a little difficult to get the cards in or out , so i 'm hoping they wo n't hurt the cards in the <unk> overall , it 's what i was looking for and should serve it 's purpose the vendor service and delivery was great
i recently purchased a digital slr and needed a way to store extra sd cards this product has plenty of storage space , closes securely and fits nicely within my small camera bag i can not speak to its durability as time will tell , but overall i am happy with product and <unk> of seller
this is a nice little case for carrying around sd cards ; it is small enough that it fit easily into a side pocket of my camera case i do wish the slots were hard plastic instead of soft sleeves as i already put a tear i one or that they were big enough to hold the memory card in their little plastic cases but they are n't ; it will work ok tho and for the price , it was worth it even if i tear a few more
simple , but effective case i had another , more expensive case for my sd cards , one with foam indentations that you could snap individual cards into however the slightest vibration caused the cards to fall out i return that case and bought this case instead this has individual sleeves for the sd cards that keep everything in place it 's also nice and compact
cheap , light , simple to <unk> wish there were more slots for sd <unk> only use it to carry sd cards so the other big slots are <unk> get what you paid
only reason this does n't have # stars is because it 's hard to get too excited over something like this it holds the cards , nicely there 's not much more to say
nice little case to organize all those sd cards that either were scattered in a desk drawer or in a baggie now they are organized in a bright blue , easy to find case even organized them by capacity which has been more convenient than i imagined enough extra space to toss in a couple of microsd cards & adapters in their oem plastic case - just sitting in the bottom of the case . # pockets can hold bare cf cards - i tried it ca n't speak about it 's durability as it is stored in a drawer but seems solidly made fits easily into pocket or purse
i feel the product is well made but i am not sure if the memory chips -lrb- sd cards -rrb- will get <unk> the plastics where you put in the sd cards may need some small holes
i received my case the other day and can already tell im going to like it its exactly what i needed will it last # years probably not but it serves my purpose and it was cheap
great little case big enough to get the job done and make it worth having , but not too big to to fit in my camera bag shipping was on time , too
i purchased this produce because i got tired of worry <unk> losing my cards with this , i have them all in one place and can put them away for safe keeping good quality and definitely worth the price
this case is everything it says it is very nice , functional , compact i have absolutely no complaints the only reason for the # -star rating is that it is what it is ; i.e . , a cheap , perfectly serviceable storage case for your sd and microsd cards thank you , eco-fused
i love the small size , and it has slots to hold lots of camera cards not the biggest fan of the plastic sleeves , but i think it will work well for a lot of cards
this case is okay my memory cards do n't stay in the pockets very well on the plus side , if they do fall out , they are still inside the wallet which zips closed so they wo n't get lost this wallet works for me , i do n't need to access my memory cards very often , i just wanted a place to store them i gave it # stars because of the price and fast shipping
the product works great holds a lot of sd cards , it zips easily not one of those that will break to fast . the price was good very happy with the product
very small , useful case my only concern , it has four slots for cf cards . this is not the case to get if you really want to frequently <unk> cf cards to say they are a tight fit is an <unk> . for the sd card slots , sd cards slid in and out , without being too loose that they would fall out
ordered to hold several sd cards on my upcoming honeymoon so far , i can say the case holds the cards fine , though the plastic sleeves may tear after repeated use we shall see object is smaller than i expected , though not so small as to get lost in my camera bag
bought this as a handy way to carry some sd cards and it works as advertised it is much more convenient than the little individual cases especially since some cards come without cases
the case is accurately described in the listing . it has the different pockets for the several cards and <unk> to be riveted together not just glued the stiching around the <unk> looks even and tight . however i just got it in the mail yesterday and upon opening it i discovered that the closure zipper is melted on one of the corners i plan to try to get the product replaced due to this . right now the zipper works , however i am sure that in a matter of time that damaged spot will fail leaving my cards <unk>
it 's compact , and a good way to keep memory cards together i would like a few things different , however i 'd like the case in a bright color so it would be easier to <unk> it would also be nice if there were a way to identify the content of the memory card in the sleeve i am thinking about just writing on the sleeve with a permanent ink pen
this is a great little case for micro sd and sd cards . throw it in your backpack or briefcase and keep then all in one place more room than i 'll ever need but great for my daughter who is in college
this was an interesting invention , great place to organize all my sd cards and i also purchased the one that stores the jump drive ... . great case easy to store and retrieve as needed
this carrying case was excellent for our trip it does exactly what it is supposed to , and it arrived on time and exactly as described my only `` complaint `` is that it is difficult to remove the sd cards from the casing at times still , i would buy this product again for the purpose it serves
the case arrived in a timely fashion ... it is what i wanted maybe it could <unk> a lip or something to attach it to handle of carrying case for laptop or <unk> machine
i purchased this thinking i could store all my memory cards in it when on vacation i take lots of photos and usually keep them in the little plastic cases they come in i think i will continue to do that so i can separate the full cards from the empty ones if you have a lot of cards without the cases -lrb- as many come without them now -rrb- this would be a great way to organize them some people complained about the smell and there was some when i received the item but left open for awhile it seemed to dissipate i really do n't need that many slots so i may use some space for an extra battery
works and so cheap it is n't super snug but the cards ai n't going anywhere they stay in the sleeve and i just needed some place to put these loose <unk>
it 's not the sturdiest case i have ever used but for now the plastic <unk> are holding strong and protected they are a little hard to get the discs out of and i was n't overly fond of how hard it is to see writing on the plastic i used some of my <unk> permanent markers and you can still barely see it it does the job
i 'm wasnt sure exactly what to expect from this some of the reviews were good , others were terrible all in all , the quality is average with no realy complaints the plastic pages are not delicate but you do have to be a bit careful not to rip them i only used about # slots and there are four other oddly shaped slots -lrb- i suppose for a cf card -rrb- which i wont use i paid $ # which i guess is ok as long as there is free shipping but would not pay more for this
it seemed like i had a bunch of sd cards laying around all of a sudden and did n't know what to do with them , this carrying case was just what i was looking for it is compact and i like the fact that it zips
works as it should it 's a little hard to get the smaller memory cards out quickly but it keeps them safe which is what was most important to me the microfiber cloth is something i 've used more than i ever thought i would when i bought this item it 's a nice bonus
i sort of wished the plastic holders that sd cards come in would fit in this case but the sd cards do fit easily in the individual slots its no <unk> , this case does what it says it 's small and holds # cards , would be better if it has outside pocket for dust cloth , but it 's ok i am going to keep it and use it zips very easy will buy from this seller again , in fact i did
this is a nicely constructed carrying case for both sd and cf card media it 's a little bit of a tight fit , but at least you know your cards are secure in there much better than having a bunch of cards just kind of floating around in your pockets
arrived in # days , not # days as promised product is wonderful the case is small enough to fit into a small camera bag the cards fit snugly but easily into the individual slots of the plastic pages the case will hold # regular cards and # large cards amazon needs to improve its free but slow shipping and live up to its promises
this is a very nice carrying case for my <unk> it helps me keep organized i also use it to store my sd disk adaptors so i do n't lose it it is lightweight and very well made
i 'm quite happy with the product it 's now protecting all those memory cards whose cases i 'd lost you have to be careful not to tear the plastic , however , as i did right off the bat but i fixed the little tear with scotch tape i would recommend black memory card case to others
the case got to me much quicker than i thought it would the case looks to be durable , but i am not sure of the plastic card holders the cards fit securely and will hold all my card for various cameras glad i got it
have n't traveled with it yet but seems just fine for the job plenty of slots , case seems sturdy and zipper works well i like that the zipper will keep anything from falling out if the cards should come out of their pockets
this case will work fine for what i need i believe it needs to have more wide pockets instead of the few pages i like to keep my cards in the case to prevent damage , then place them in the case i had to take three out of the case so they would fit in the smaller pockets
product as described & as i had hoped for construction is good & plastic inserts are sufficient for several <unk> of memory cards i liked it & think others would appreciate same
it 's not like this thing is <unk> to come with a clamp so you never lose it ... it 's just a <unk> little case to keep some cards in stick it in a zipper pocket or something
this unit is exactly what i wanted it may be a little `` light weight `` but i have not had it long enough to check durability now i wish that i could find one with higher capacity for `` thumb drives `` . # stars because i have not given it a full test
i like the quantity of spaces it has for the cards but the overall quality can be better , i feel it not that durable after playing with it for a while
would have liked to have had a color selection because the black case itself is small enough to become lost among all our other black items maybe a bright orange or red offering and the <unk> in the center could be smaller so that there would be more flexibility among the vinyl sleeves
product is good it does what it says it does the pockets and the case are a bit hard , making it less `` nice `` that more expensive brands like lowepro but for the price , i can not complain
this makes carrying sd cards very compact and convenient most of the pages had room for # sd cards each , but i was confused as to why there was a page with # larger slots included i tried a cf card but it was too big
handy case for storing memory cards very basic design without any frills would be nice if it had a carabiner or loop to attach a carabiner to so you can hang it in your bag as it is a very small case that 'll be hard to find in a backpack otherwise , it serves its purpose
received this item recently it arrived in a timely fashion it can store a lot of memory cards a bit of a tight fit but so far so good it is light the zipper is a bit tight hopefully it will loosen with time and use that 's my only complaint so far
as you would expect for the price , there is nothing fancy here the case is more than adequate for home or travel , offers some protection , and will keep your cards organized overall , a good deal , especially with prime shipping
this case is very small , this might be a plus or a con depending on how you want to use it i cut an index card into small pieces that fit in each of the pockets so that i can record what is on each memory card
this case is as described and works well the sleeves hold memory cards in place but will tear over time if used roughly for the price it is a good buy
adequate for the purpose the zippered bag is about # / `` by # / # `` , has # pockets # / # `` x # / # `` and four pockets sized # / # `` x # / # `` i am happy with the purchase now i have all my memory cards in one place
it is cheap quality but it does do what it says i wish it was more sturdy but since it was inexpensive i say its better than the envelope i was using
good memory card case . plenty of room for lots of sd cards , and the case itself is very tiny i wish it came with a lanyard tho , because it is so small
i was looking for someway to organize memory cards from cameras , trail cameras , etc . they are small items which can easily get misplaced the eco-fused card carrying case fit the bill very nicely at a very affordable price i 'm fast becoming a believer that whatever you 're looking for , you should check at amazon first the vast assortment of products and reliable sellers as well as quick delivery are second to none the eco-fused card case arrived before the estimated delivery date and was as described i would definitely do business with this seller again
this product is very handy to keep various types of memory cards that i often use it is a very simple design and a nice looking bag , the size of a mini <unk> purse i like it very much and in fact i bought one extra to give out as a gift
i do n't feel some of th other reviews were <unk> correct this case is well put together with quality materials the plastic card sleeves are flexible but snug for cost of this case , it 's a good buy
it is a great quality little case , but the only thing that makes it <unk> is that , once it is more than half full , it becomes difficult to slide the cards into the slots still , it does the job of keeping me organized
i like this sd card carrying case as it holds more sd cards than the others i found during my search however i would like to find one that holds twice as many i take a lot of photos and will run out of slots very soon , as i only <unk> about half and save the others so in order to avoid trying to store multiple carrying cases , it would be nice to have all my cards in one case this one has # slots for normal sd cards , which is all i use , but it <unk> # slots for larger cards eco-fused should offer you a choice of carrying cases for just the regular size sd cards , and another if you use the larger cards
this seems to be a neat little case to keep the cards in order instead of lost the zipper works smoothly , and the sides are stiff enough to prevent bending or crushing i have added a little index card inside the cover , with numbers and <unk> of which cards are which , and <unk> the plastic pockets with a fine point sharpie so i can find things quickly i do presentations for garden groups , so it is handy having all the relevant photos quickly accessible i 'd give it # stars if it lay a bit flatter when open to make inserting the cards easier for old fingers
the item is what it says it protects and organizes my collection of sd cards it seems to be built sturdy , the stitching looks good and the zipper works while being sturdy it is n't overly bulky it fits comfortably in my pocket or in my camera case it 's been a good product so far so why only four stars i have a five star case that is better built , the sleeves are more sturdy and it 's crush resistant ; however , it costs three times as much so for the money , i think this case is tough to beat ! -lrb- inexpensive but not cheap
so far works well it does have a strong odor when opened , if they could get rid of the chemical smell it would be a plus if it came with sticker labels that might be nice for labeling the pockets with dates
i was looking for a case to keep my many memory cards and found this from amazon delivery was prompt it has many pockets with # different sizes to store my sd , mini , micro and bigger memory cards while the zipper looks a bit fragile and the stitching quality could be further improved , i m happy with this purchase - value for money i like its casing material as it feels like ballistic nylon :
this case is very straightforward does n't feel flimsy or cheap , but is n't over the top wish i would have gotten it sooner , i 've lost # too many sd cards over the past few months
it was much smaller than anticipated , which makes it great for travel or just throwing into my bag as needed it definitely fits sd cards much better than cf , but you can squeeze in # cf cards if you need to i will agree that the plastic is a bit too tight , in that the cf cards fit very very exact , and if i pushed more , the plastic will probably eventually rip for the money , it 's well worth it it 's cheap , but not flimsy enough to be unusable or terrible since it 's zippered , worst case is that i can just slide in some extra cards w/o them being in a little sleeve
purchased this case so we could bring multiple sd cards with us on a vacation when putting the first card in a slot , the plastic tore a little on one of the slots was n't a big deal , as we 're only bringing a handful of extra cards , and this case holds many more than we have did n't have trouble putting cards in the other storage slots in the plastic protectors i 'm looking forward to being able to easily keep track of all our cards , and keep them in order of the days we 're taking pictures it 's a great case for the price
this case works to hold sd cards as advertised it has a fairly cheap feel - it 's neither a `` professional `` or `` luxury `` item , which you would n't expect at this price i would like to find a more elegant way to <unk> sd cards - perhaps in some sort of solid divider box with labels
love the color : i can find it in the shadows of my bag i would give it # stars if one of the pockets would fit the card reader adapter for my ipad it fits inside a cf pocket , but just barely
this case is perfect for what i was looking for - a small , lightweight case to carry all of my sd and micro sd cards my only complaint is that it can be kind of hard to get the micro sd cards out if you have big fingers
just what it says is what i got i am very happy and would recommend this to others i did not need a hard case for my use so this worked perfectly
the quality is not <unk> but it is a solid piece of card holder there are holders for # cf cards and # sd cards but <unk> from the overall interior height of the case , it would be easier for you to <unk> the card if you only put # sd cards and # <unk> in it i am using the cf card sections more so it works great for me
the sd pockets are a little tight making it not easy to get the cards in the tight fit means that the cards are held securely i do n't think i 'll ever need the large pockets , so i would have been happy to have more sd pockets
this case has a very simple design that will allow you to protect your memory cards the only downside i see it that the slots are meant for standard sd cards therefore <unk> cards may end up sliding around some an easy way to solve this would be to store your <unk> cards in an adapter first the adapters are very inexpensive & help act as secondary protection for the cards themselves
hi i found them to work well the only suggestion i would have is on each card pocket to have a label so that you could write what each card contains for data because as you know it 's hard to write on the cards themselves
ca n't really complain since this was so inexpensive , although i do think the design would be better if they ditched the plastic sleeves and used something else i also purchased a great <unk> holder at the same time and that one had <unk> holders for the drives , which will hold up better over time but this case is great in a pinch and keeps all my memory cards organized and from falling out of various <unk> cases
