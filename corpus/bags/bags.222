had it about # weeks , and am using it every day it is not as <unk> as the picture it holds a # inch laptop nicely it is not as heavy as i expected there is no shoulder strap , but it is light enough that i have not missed it i have transported two laptops in it without issue we shall see about durability of the handle it is always the telescoping handles that fail on this design
a little more plasticy than i had expected but still a nice quality piece i did notice the slight smell when i first got it but it has gone now after a week fits really well with good access to the ventilation ports the apple hole only allows the top cover to be put on one way around so easy to install and feels very secure looks great and gives good protection
i thought it would add a lot of thickness due to the leather , but it is much more <unk> and thinner than i expected feel great , high quality the only area lacking complete protection is the apple logo , and rear # corners of the laptop , which just have small tabs extending up from the case all in all , its definitely worth the price i 'll probably put a sticker or something over the open apply logo , as i do n't want it to get scratched
this case fits so well on my macbook pro retina it also looks really stylish and does n't take away from my computer 's style and shape some reviews complained about the apple logo being off-center , but i do n't have that issue at all i 'm so glad i spent extra on a leather case versus those cheap plastic ones if i ever sell my mac , i rest assured knowing that this case will protect it from blemishes etc .
the case is sturdy and well made the fit is perfect and snug it was a breeze to put on my mac book should be well protected from all but the worst abuse i could n't be happier with the product
i just bought this case last week , it was delivered very fast , much faster than i thought actually it fits my newest model of mac book pro very well i ordered a grey one , the color is just the same as what you see on web page this is definitely a nice buy i do recommend it to every mac book pro owner absolutely a five-star case !
i have been a gadget guy since i was # years old actually before then , but at # i could afford more stuff i am # now i have used this kind of product for tablets , cell phones and laptops for many years none of those are as functional and luxurious looking as the kuzy product thank you for making this product and at an affordable price
i ordered this as a gift for my sister and she loved it for about # weeks and then the case started to crack at the corners and flake away it it not very durable i guess you get what you pay for but i am highly disappointed
i just love my new mac book case my brand new laptop exterior was already showing scratches and marks after just weeks of use i was overwhelmed with the options for cases for my particular laptop this case was perfect for my needs it was easy to apply and the chevron pattern was just what i was looking for to make my computer stand out from the rest
i purchased this cover for my macbook pro , after i ruined the top piece . i looked for a while and finally decided on this one i wo n't lie , when i opened the box i was n't too sure about it as it looked a little flimsy however , when i actually placed it on my computer it fit very snugly and looked awesome . i get a great deal of compliments on the cover , and the keyboard covers work nicely too . it takes some getting used to , but once the cover fits down over the keys it is a very nice feel .
its an excellent thickness and style , no zipper and is n't bulky so it can fit nicely into like a backpack or something that already has a laptop pocket however , it advertises as a # inch sleeve , and i guess i should have read into the dimensions of the laptop , but it does n't fit like i hoped it was a little disappointing , honestly
i use this for a # & # # ; macbook pro retina and it certainly fits it , although tightly i need to stretch the case corners over the laptop before zipping , which is n't ideal , but for the price it is worthwhile other cases that i found at about this price were often <unk> loose by reviewers for the same model of macbook
i really like this case it 's well padded , but one of the corners has started to fray because the sleeve is very thick , the fraying has n't produced a hole , which is good , but i had n't expected fraying so soon i 've only had it for # months
just what i needed , its beautiful and classy just gave it # and not # coz it does n't have a compartment for the adapter separately ... but it fits in the main compartment , so thats
this case fits the acer c # chromebook like a glove just what i was looking for not much room for anything else maybe an sd card or a flash drive
just received the case today and could n't be more pleased with the purchase pricing is very reasonable and quality is top notch you 've spent a lot on your tablet so do n't <unk> in its protection
i bougth this case for my acer aspire v # inch and it fits snug i can put the laptop inside the way i want and it 's never a problem have n't tried to pour liquid over it , yet , but i 'm sure it will protect my device properly
we are very satisfied with the quality of this product , size is correct and material very <unk> delivery schedule better than expected , in good condition we recommend the product and the supplier
excellent value for money -lrb- at # . # -rrb- this sleeve does everything one can expect from a laptop sleeve ; it protects your laptop it is well designed and has a high quality feel to it , which exceeded my expectations for a laptop sleeve of this price overall , a great purchase
this sleeve is just what i needed for easier traveling it provides some protection to my laptop when i slide it into my carry-on backpack with all of my other items and i can put the <unk> laptop directly in the tsa tray since it does n't have any zippers
this sleeve is great for my macbook air # . # & # # ; it is a bit of a snug fit but that was exactly what i wanted my hard cover has n't come in so i 'm not yet sure how it will fit in the snug sleeve overall , it is a good product and i also love that it is waterproof
i wanted a simple sleeve with no zippers or other hardware that could eventually scratch my rmbp purpose is to be able to insert the computer -lrb- with sleeve -rrb- into a targus vertical rolling case and be able to extract the rmbp in sleeve at tsa checkpoints without having to remove the laptop i have a similar sleeve for a tablet so i had a good idea of what i was looking for first impressions after receiving the sleeve and inserting the rmbp is that it is a perfect , snug fit it fits into the targus case perfectly and adds a bit extra protection and snugness it 's exactly what i wanted i did not experience any issues with the flap not closing completely because of the snug fit there does not seem to be any ` play ' once the rmbp is inserted though you may need to tug the sleeve a bit when closing it anyone looking for a sleeve for a similar application should be more than happy with this one
bought the # . # & # # ; model for my lenovo yoga pro # since it was n't <unk> made for the lenovo yoga pro # , i was n't expecting a glove like fit so i was n't suprised that it is about # inches wider than would have been ideal but even without being a perfect fit , it is well constructed and well padded and i was happy with that is was <unk> priced i would n't expect it to provide much protection from a fall , but not many cases would and it suites my purposes fine -lrb- my purposes was i wanted to protect my ultrabook inside a computer bag -rrb-
this is a high quality laptop sleeve the first thing i noticed was that the material is thick and flawless it just feels good to the touch also noticed that even the zipper pull has a plastic cover the neoprene is soft and according to the description water resistant i have a # . # inch laptop and though it 's an older thicker version it fits perfectly once in , the laptop feels secure and does n't slide around i own a couple of other laptop cases but this is thickness and most luxurious one sample was received for review purposes
it 's made for a fashion show this is not for hiking or even a good bug out bag the middle ring had the paint chipped on my <unk> black did n't bother me cuz i 'm not into fashion what bothers me is all the good reviews i make my purchases based on everyone 's reviews got ta tell it like it is this is a fancy purse
every year i look at this bag and take another bag at half the price that does n't last that long i get a year out of most backpacks and the carrier bags generally wear on your shoulders so i said what the hell and purchased this back and i feel like i spoiled myself crazy i love the design and the comfort i can fill this bag up and it still feels like it 's empty this is the best bag i have ever owned
carries the load well the adjustable straps make the pack fit multiple frame sizes from my broad and wide shoulders to the narrow slim structure of my teenager
holds everything i need when i travel sits comfortable on my back , even while walking for hours in vegas fits easily under the seats on airplanes loaded with clothes ans <unk> couldnt ask for a better backpack
this case cracked within the first week seller did not respond to me with anything other than an option for me to return the product at my own expense they gave no explanation of whether they would credit me back for a refund or if they even wanted to exchange it out i actually expected better , such as them asking for a picture and then them sending me a new top at no charge however , i was very disappointed after spending $ # on a worthless product the keyboard skins are a nice touch to the crappy case , but they are not the easiest thing to type with and do stretch over time i would not recommend this product
when i received this product i loved it it was a cute color , came with two pad covers and made my mac much more chic when i opened the package and put it on i noticed at the corners of the top covers there were lines i thought it was broke but after looking at all four corners i noticed they were all like that , the line length varied well now two of the four corners have broken off , it has n't even been a month since i bought the product do not buy spend a little more money and get the speck one , super expensive but worth the money
the only thing i liked was my keyboard cover . other than that the case was absolutely worthless . it cracked within the first week and it had n't been dropped or anything to even cause that i do n't recommend this to anyone . waste of
love the look and it fits great , but after a few days i noticed small hairline cracks at the corners now it is cracking in many different areas the keyboard cover is great i love it i 'm planning or order another case just in case my first experience was a fluke i really like the look of the case and want it to work out
i would recommend this product to anyone love how it fit the mac book snugg and slim and also provides some protection . the keypad cover is also very nice looks a lot better in real when it is on i got a lot of compliments for this case especially the keyboard cover from colleagues the only reason i did n't give it s # star was because i did not expect the color to be so bright dont get me wrong i love the color , just that is was quite bold and really stands out so in a professional setting that i work in it may be a bit distracting but other than that i love it
i love this case it fits perfectly with my new macbook i had this case for over two weeks and theres still no cracks or scratches like others have reported the only thing i did not really like was the keyboard cover i 'm in love with the color and it does fit the keyboard on the macbook but i did not like the feeling of it while typing it sort of slowed my typing speed which i ca n't really be patient with especially since i am in school and i need to type notes fast if you do n't mind typing slow , it would probably work for you other than that ... highly recommend . :
i am very pleased with this purchase item looks exactly as pictured the case went on smoothly without scratching my -lrb- late # -rrb- mbp and it does not appear bulky i ordered my case in clear crystal , and i am ecstatic about how sleek my mbp looks the keyboard protectors are great quality , fit well , and look awesome i would recommend this seller and <unk> product to mbp users
i have n't had a single issue with this case and keyboard cover i get a crazy amount of compliments about how great it looks and i have n't had any issues with it falling off i feel much more protected with these accessories now
fits perfect and cleans easily it 's mostly for protecting the color and the outer shell of the laptop i do n't know how well it protects the laptop b/c i have n't dropped yet lol but i do love the little legs to angle it
simple plastic snap on case my chromebook just sits around the house so this should be perfect that said , i do n't know how it would hold up to bouncing around in or constant being pulled in and out of a bag or backpack
the cover is doing a good job of keeping my chromebook white when i would put my chromebook in my bag , the corners would get <unk> this cover helps with that if i took the cover off my chromebook today , it would look brand new
i have the snow white chromebook # it has a rubber feel to it and i am worried about staining so this clear case is great for keeping the chromebook clean i would buy another if i ever need one
this case is perfect for my hp chromebook # i ordered the clear one for my white chromebook and it works great it snapped on easily and has protected my chromebook from dirt and scratches i would highly recommend this !
if you have a # `` hp chromebook , you really need to get this it fits great , looks great , and protects great definitely glad i got this it also has two foldable kickstands underneath that lift up the back of the laptop those are useful to keep the sound from being muffled because the speakers are underneath the laptop
we purchased a chromebook # and we were looking around for a case we didnt want a bag ! ! ! i wanted something that would protect the finish on our chromebook # the selection isnt great at the stores plus the prices in the retail stores are just way to high so after <unk> amazon and ebay i found ipearl inc. not only did it ship super fast but it was so easy to put on and my chromebook # it already saved my chromebook from a drop great product , great price , best and easiest transaction ever ! !
just received today and it fits my hp chromebook fine i especially like the `` feet `` on the bottom because the chromebook does get hot , this allows more air circulation on the bottom of the machine the color is nice and it is see through , i can see the hp logo through the cover i feel it is a good option cover for the dollar amount my chromebook is white and i just ca n't get the scuff marks off of it unfortunately they show through the cover it would be good if it was a <unk> through cover , but that would also probably increase the price its a bright kelly green - the closest match i can think of is a green sucker i do n't think there is anything wrong with it and it does a good job of adding a pop of color to my chromebook and protecting it from more scuffs it will not protect if your laptop is dropped - not designed to do that it adds color and protection from scuffs and dirt -lrb- pets walking over it -rrb-
this case fit very well on my hp chromebook # & # # ; the color was true to the picture and the shipping was very fast i received great service from this company and i would definitely purchase from the company again i would recommend this to anyone with an hp chromebook # & # # ; who is looking for a good and sturdy case for their computer you wo n't be disappointed
i am very pleased with my ipearl mcover case it was here within a couple of days -lrb- even with the bad weather that was going on -rrb- , the color is great and it fits perfectly may order another one in a different color , just to change it up ! =
i 've had the cover for a few weeks now with no complaints its the only cover i found that fits the # & # # ; hp chromebook so lack of competition is in its favor it stays on the device well and protects against fingerprints and grease stains the colors are nice , some translucency so you can still see the manufacturer <unk> underneath
the case fits great on the chromebook - & # # ; snaps & # # ; on and does n't slip at all loved all the color options too wished i could have gotten with amazon prime shipping but it came pretty quickly anyway
i got this when i ordered my hp chromebook and i am not disappointed the green really pops it protects well and fits like a glove and the feet to elevate the computer is a great feature all the slots and vents are cut perfectly do not hesitate in your decision to purchase you will be <unk>
i was looking for something to protect the rubberish finish on my chromebook # because the surface seems to absorb stains and they are hard to get out so now with the hard shell cover that wo n't be a problem anymore it snaps on and stays on and is n't bulky definitely worth the money
i just wanted something to protect my c # chromebook from all the fingerprints and scratches i could imagine it might get the top piece fits very nicely the bottom piece does not fit properly it stays on decently , but it does n't snap on all the way the color actually looks a bit darker than the picture -lrb- more like dark teal -rrb- once you put it on the gray chromebook i have n't used the little `` kickstands `` on the bottom , but they seem to be pretty sturdy i just wish the bottom piece would snap on completely
i got this case thinking it would be perfect for what i needed when it came in the mail and i went to put it on , it was about a # inch too short on both sides for both the front and back i also was n't a big fan of the tabs on t he back that you could flip up to elevate the keyboard i think it would have been a great case if it would have actually fit my laptop
when i ordered this i had seen some of the reviews and overlooked a few things , thinking it had more better reviews than bad i finally got mine today i rated this # stars because it is doing exactly what i wanted it to do just to be a cover it fit perfectly fine the bottom is nice , it has some vent slots so the laptop can still breath the color is nothing like the picture i guess if you have light shining on it , it may look like the color in the picture the grips on the bottom do n't grip very well overall it works fine , but not true to the color listed
product is as advertised colour is slightly lighter than advertised only because they use a dark silver acer chromebook in the photo mine is brighter -lrb- still transparent -rrb- since i own the white acer chromebook product does feel slightly flimsy -lrb- especially the legs -rrb- , however it fits like a glove top does not pop off like other reviews it will do the trick to keep chromebook clean and scratch free i would definitely buy another one - maybe the pink now that i know it is brighter in colour :
fits great and adds a pop of color to the chromebook love the <unk> underneath to angle the laptop while typing they do seem as if they would easily break i will update my review to comment on the <unk> , but so far i love it i am considering ordering other colors
i love this laptop cover , it fit my laptop perfectly and i like the kickstands it has on the bottom to raise up your laptop the color is a shade darker than i was expecting but it is still a very pretty color , it is more of a bright aqua than a pale blue one the only real complaint i have is that the top cover seemed to have some scratches or stains on it which i was unable to remove that being said , the were on the side the is not directly visible but if you look closely you will notice them due to the transparency not a big deal for me , and i am very happy with my purchase
i just received my chromebook and this cover today i ca n't speak for durability , but the cover fits securely and looks nice i would recommend it to give your chromebook a nice pop of color : #
wanted the red but they were out of stock next tried the green but did n't like the reviews about it not fitting , always popping off came to the aqua cover and the reviews were favorable and no cases of the the top cover coming off received the cover quickly and it went on in a & # # ; snap & # # ; , no pun intended i 'm not sure how people are opening their chromebook but i know mine opens <unk> i can see how the top cover would -lrb- and does -rrb- pop off if you try opening the book by lifting the cover instead of the book itself hope this helps , take care
this is the perfect hard shell case for my chromebook i have had it for a few days now and there are no problems with the fit at all color is cute and case seems durable love the kickstands i got the <unk> and have received many compliments
i read a lot of bad reviews about this case not fitting properly but i decided to buy it anyway i had a hard shell case from ipearl for my macbook air and that fit perfect and offered a lot of protection i figured if it did n't fit right that i could just return it to my amazement , i took it out of the package put the cover on the front and back in about a minute and they both snapped in perfectly for a nice tight fit , no gaps the aqua color looks really nice on the chromebook also
this case works well , and i 'm glad that i bought it it fits my acer c # chromebook , and makes it look a little more unique installing the shell case was a breeze , and probably took # seconds it seems to protect it well and did n't really add any weight to my chrome book at first i was n't sure how i felt about the two kickstands underneath , as they seem a bit flimsy , but they actually work quite well
the pink on the case does n't match the pink on any of the keyboard covers , the keyboard covers are definitely a hot pink and the case is more of a soft rose pink why make a bundle pack if they do n't match not only that but the keyboard covers are too loose on the keys and move around a lot which is really irritating
the case was easy enough to install , although cheaply made you get what you pay for with this all of the keyboard covers fit well onto the keyboard same quality -lrb- cheap -rrb- , but came with four covers makes typing a bit more difficult , but able to adjust to having the cover over the keyboard
i absolutely love the keyboard covers , but the actual case itself does not fit perfectly for the new macbook air the top on mine does not stay on and the bottom snaps everywhere , but on one side of the keyboard i 'm honestly disappointed with the case . it did arrive sooner than expected though , so that 's a plus
this is my second purchase for # different lap tops i am so pleased at the quality and durability for the price i am buying another to give as a gift delivery was very fast too
my clear case just came in today and it is very clean looking it 's a clear hard case so it is perfect for when i put a decal on my computer it was snug and the keyboard pads are nice as well :
prior to ordering inquired seller about shipping , was prompt in responding and courteous ordered aqua blue & pink case , both colors were close in color to advertised loved both colors easy to put on the cases be sure to look which way you are putting on the bottom case , correct way will not cover the usb ports keyboard covers are great , only complaint is the solid blue covers the caps lock light
i purchased this for my son 's brand new $ # lenovo yoga # pro while attaching to the lid of the laptop it cracked the screen in the corner , they fit very tightly these should not be sold for thin laptop screened computers i 'm amazed amazon carries this inferior product it is just two pieces of ridged plastic not worth $ # <unk> the $ # price tag it offers almost no protection for any computer
if you use both the top and bottom cover , the computer wo n't open to tablet form , there will be a gap , which over time , may damage the hinges i took off the bottom half , opting to protect the screen side
if you put the case on , the computer is too thick to fold if you only put the top layer on it will however fold way too expensive for this crap
fits great but this color orange is only appropriate if you work on a construction site or plan on using it in the middle of the highway it is bright reflector orange and you will not be able to fold your laptop into tablet mode
i accidentally ordered the wrong size case for my macbook when i tried to return it , amazon would not let me because it is considered a hazardous material something to keep in mind before purchasing if there is a good side in this , the keyboard covers still fit , so it was not a complete waste of money
the case is great the top part is rubberized and is easy to grip the bottom has good securely placed rubber pads that keeps the laptop from sliding the color is also as it looks on the pictures -lrb- i picked the hot blue -rrb- the keyboard covers are also good they slightly slow my typing speed , but not too much
i love the color of the case although it turned out different than i thought it would be , i like it even more it 's more of a translucent purple rather than the frosty look it kind of has in the picture the keyboard pads are great too
i was a bit skeptical , i 've purchased other cases but this is by far the <unk> one for the best price and you see the apple logo shine through clearly i picked the purple one , it compliments my mac perfectly
the product came on time as pictured the case is great and fits perfectly the colors are exactly as show in the pictures and the keyboard covers fit perfectly without bunching up -lrb- which is what i was afraid of -rrb- very satisfied and thinking about buying even more colors from this seller
this backpack is strong and offers a decent -lrb- but shy of super -rrb- amount of padding to protect your electronics note , however , that it is not quite as big as it appears in the photos -- you can fit a change of clothes in there , but not if you 're going to a formal wedding the black style with red trim looks great , especially if you like zippers welcome to zipper city it reminds me of a pair of pants i had in # there are ten of those bad boys , and that 's just on the outside -- a couple more are hiding on inside pockets so if you have a lot of small items , this could be the bag for you
looks to be very rugged and well constructed . lots of pockets not a whole lot of internal room for overnight stays though the pocket for the laptop is a little big for ultra book with a # . # & # # ; screen , but i knew that going in i was happy to see that my ipad fits in the appropriate pouch and i do n't have to take off the protective , folding <unk>
this deluxe backpack is very impressive well padded , heavy-duty zippers and a variety of compartments to carry both a laptop and tablet -lrb- securely protected -rrb- as well as a variety of computer tablet cords and chargers or office supplies it 's a product that looks as if it well <unk> to wear and tear a long while as well great product for college students or those constantly on the go you will feel secure carrying your expensive computers in this backpack
i always tell my <unk> if they 're looking for a laptop case to get one of these laptop backpacks instead the reason being it 's less likely to get stolen because someone does n't really know if the laptop is inside but if you 're carrying around a laptop case there is a # % chance there 's a laptop inside and yes these are little bit more expensive than a standard laptop case but to me it 's like insurance you pay more for the extra protection this backpack is very nicely constructed and the fact that has a sleeve for ipad in addition to the laptop is great it fit a # inch macbook pro very nicely i 've no complaints with his backpack it has a lot of compartments for storing everything you 'll need to carry thanks for reading
we have a similar laptop backpack by thule the thule is a great backpack , but it was just a little bulky and had the hard & # # ; clamshell & # # ; compartment at the top this case logic backpack is now our go-to backpack for when we travel its smaller form factor makes it much easier to travel with than our thule backpack the red highlights on the backpack are well placed giving it a great look the storage compartments are well thought out from the laptop , tablet , to the side pockets where a water bottle can fit the shoulder straps are very comfortable , and when the backpack was full of stuff , it still felt comfortable and well weighted the zippers are large and high quality , and the handle at the top is thick and sturdy there 's also a handle on the bottom for <unk> it horizontally
this backpack appears to be very well made , and has lots of nice storage pockets for electronics and other items the zippers function well and have easy to use pulls , etc . i may be & # # ; luggage <unk> & # # ; , but i never had a backpack before i was probably waiting for a quality item like this and will be very happy to put it to good use
i bought this bag for a # . # `` laptop mbp , an extra battery , a spare hd , and some papers not very much stuff so i was extremely disappointed that a $ # leather bag that supposedly was of good quality had one of the straps completely rip off the body of the bag , where the strap was stitched in the side this bag was used for # months before the strap ripped under normal , daily usage there was nothing done to shorten the life of a bag such as this one
this case is good for carrying a notebook computer and a small number of files , but does not provide the capacity i need for long international trips there is not enough space for headphones , extra files , and other items that are necessary for international trips and business meetings i have used it for one domestic trip , with pc and ipad and files , but had to put headphones in my <unk> it is ok for short domestic trips , and quality of the construction appears to be good
this is a very high quality leather case with good hardware my laptop fits well and it has a place for almost everything the almost is a limited amount of space to carry the computer power supply and cords there is n't a pocket deep enough to carry those items without causing the outside to bulge the velcro flap <unk> are <unk> and overdone a few snaps would have been much better other than that the quality is first rate
there 's no way i can not not like this bag - its leathery , its tough , it looks good and has a lot of space for a laptop and paperwork and i never paid a dime for the # that i had i get these for free back when i worked for ibm we were moving out of a client site and moving our assets out of that client company i have a stack of these things and was told to throw them away i decided to keep them as they were near brand new , some still had the product <unk> 's card in it i cleaned up the leather and <unk> them i still have # left i gave the rest away ... wish i had known how much these sold for ~
there are better cases on the market , but i could n't find one close to the price of this one holds the pc snuggly , and there is lots of gadget space
i was looking for a replacement for my old hard-shelled briefcase even though i do n't use it for carrying a laptop computer , this case is perfect for all my work needs
this case travels all over the world with me for the last # years , for # % of the year it is sturdy , fits in overhead <unk> , under the seat and can be easily accessed during check-in , boarding , and walking on an airport zippers last forever , despite me this is my travel companion , i have bought a second one just to be safe it is not sold anymore not the <unk> tumi or samsonite prices , just a nice simple sturdy case , looking good enough to take into a client meeting and fast enough to travel stress free
this case is a great little case for netbooks it is big enough , with extra pockets to hold all the extras you may be carrying around with the netbook , like a power cord , mouse , and possibly even an external cd drive construction seems to be high quality i would have given this thing perfect reviews except it does not come with a shoulder strap , multiple other buyers mentioned this in their reviews as well i contacted targus ' customer service and was basically told `` sorry , tough luck , here is one you can buy for the same price as what the whole case cost you `` even though the description here on amazon , on targus ' website , and on the product packaging clearly states and shows it with a padded shoulder strap since a strap to allow it to be carried hands free is kind of the whole point of getting this case , that one <unk> cost it # stars some other reviewers seemed to have luck getting a replacement strap from targus but they pretty much ignored me so do n't hold your breath
i bought it for school just around # months , and it 's broken now the bottom of the backpack is very weak you ca n't fill much is things in your backpack although it has a huge storage space the bottom ca n't afford too much things
i was given the bag to me by work and within # days the top seem began to rip there is now a # inch long rip along where the fabric meets the zipper
i got this for my # in macbook air since it 's designed for # in notebooks , i figured that there would be enough room my macbook can barely snug in to the case plus the material is not very sturdy it is truly a sleeve only , not a case , after only # months of use , there 's a big hole at the bottom corner , exposing the cheap white foam lining i will upload a picture for proof
functionally , it 's a good bag , but the one i got had an obvious manufacturer defect on the front left corner i would n't have bought it if i saw it in the store and would gladly pay full price to get a bag that didnt look defective too much trouble to return it
i bought one of these sleeves for my acer netbook , and used it for what it was supposedly designed for : i carried around a netbook in it and i would even say i carried it gently since the contents are fragile , and i only <unk> it from my house to my car and back -lrb- # ft -rrb- no public transportation , or long distances within two weeks one of the top handle straps pulled out and away from the case so that it was only attached at one end i was <unk> by this , but thinking it was probably just a fluke , was willing to give targus another chance i returned the defective one for another of the same product i received the second sleeve , and although it has lasted a couple of weeks longer -lrb- # weeks total -rrb- , one of the handle straps is again fraying and will soon pull out like the first one so i can only <unk> that this is a product of poor quality that does not last at all i know we live in a <unk> society -lrb- and that is a shame -rrb- , but this is ridiculous i do not recommend this product
i 've ordered the wheeled bag before for my daughter for school it was relatively light for a wheeled bag and has worked well for her i went to order another one for my younger daughter and ordered the other # `` bag thinking it was just a different color one bag has wheels and one is just a backpack i dont think amazon should have them both on the same page
i purchased this bag for my asus # n net book -lrb- which is great -rrb- this is a <unk> bag . the # n fits snugly , almost too snugly it 's a bit of a squeeze getting the net book into the case i had to be careful to avoid scratching the # n on the zipper as mentioned in other reviews , there is very little room for accessories i 'm able to fit the power supply and a relatively small logitech bluetooth mouse in the front pouch but that 's about it if i had to do it again , i might consider a case/bag with more storage options
i noticed right away that this bag had a lot of pockets to put things in also , with all the pockets , a lot of zippers it seems to be a pain to go through two levels of zippers to get to something from the outside , the bag is quite busy with # zippered enclosures -lrb- more zippers on the inside -rrb- the laptop sleeve does its job well i can easily pack my laptop and a few books in the roomy bag however , as the bag gets half full , you begin to realize how thin the shoulder straps are it hardly gives any padding at all not a bad buy , but not a great one either
i was actually looking for a higher quality leather case for my acer # . # `` notebook , but could n't find one with the right features and price point at the time in the interim , i decided to purchase the targus # `` <unk> # sport mini-notebook slipcase it satisfies my basic needs , in that it has both a carry handle & shoulder strap -lrb- an <unk> combination for small notebook cases -rrb- , and it has some additional space to carry other accessories my only criticism is that i wish the bag was # `` wider on its inside dimension to accommodate the # . # `` documents i often carry when i travel otherwise , this is a highly practical and reasonably well <unk> slipcase for the price i paid -lrb- $ # amazon -rrb- while it 's probably worthy of # stars in its price range , i gave it # stars for being slightly too narrow to carry standard size documents
it would be perfect for just a # . # `` netbook alone with its power cord however , it is a little small for the inside pocket -lrb- s -rrb- to hold the power cord and a very slim external optical drive i fear putting the the optical drive in the case will cause <unk> wear of the zippers other than that , so far so good for the # weeks of use would like to have had a little more padding on the bottom side very similiar to a <unk> dvd carrying case
