this unit is made of polyester material which appears to be able to withstand the typical life of a travelling business man i wanted something lite and it had to have the minimum depth but still be able to hold my computer , accessories and documents i wanted that minimum depth as i ride a commuter rail to work daily and always have to have the case in front of my seat it holds my computer , has several pockets and not only does the telescoping handle feel sturdy but it is high enough to easily pull the case the addition of the front feet is great as it allows you to stand the case up okay here is my wish list of items to be added when i carry a cold water bottle i have to put it in the case without a pocket : my backpack had a <unk> mesh pocket on the outside that was great # i carry a lot of some items and which it had a zipper to close each product it does n't seem that this case at this price would be a great one but it is
i bought this rolling case for my father after his old one had it 's ... everything fall apart i heard the case was durable with <unk> skate wheels he loves it the wheels glide across everything and he can fit everything he needs for work inside -lrb- laptop , few folders , cell phone ... i know he tends to ` beat ' on stuff , -lrb- i 've seen his car -rrb- and this bag is holding up just fine
this is a very sturdy laptop bag it fits my larger sized laptop great lots of storage for papers , files , etc . have had it for a few months now and it is fantastic
this bag is a good size and has lots of pockets i was pleasantly surprised for its durability given its price compared to similar bags we liked it so much that my husband ordered one after he saw mine
i bought a large laptop and then discovered that my small carrier would not hold it it took a lot of looking to find this one in which the laptop fits easily and is quite secure -lrb- in the # rd of # compartments -rrb- and cushioned
this is a great bag with lots of room for my files and other things that i need to drag along to visit my clients as well as use for commuting good quality and price
this briefcase completely saved my life i was hesitant to get one , too worried about being ` cool ' than practical i 'm glad i made the right choice this case is fantastic , roomy , and very durable the best $ # bucks i 've ever spent !
i am very happy with the quality of the case it holds my laptop and several file folders , supplies and personal items it also has many compartments for good organization very good value
i ordered this wheelie cart so i could haul everything i need for substitute teaching assignments it has filled the bill perfectly because i am assigned different classrooms at different schools everyday , i need to be sure i do not leave anything behind with this wonderful wheelie cart , i make a quick glance into each zippered compartment and , voila ! everything is easily <unk> for it is roomy , <unk> , lightweight but sturdy
i dragged this case through # miles and # inches of <unk> sidewalks , salt and ice the wheels still operate like new and the material is waterproof it is well worth the reasonable price
just a couple of days before christmas my husband informed me that he wanted a `` laptop case with wheels `` that was the entire description he gave me i quickly searched this site , read the positive reviews on this particular product and decided to purchase , thinking it would never arrive in time for christmas much to my amazement , it arrived the very next day at no additional charge my husband is so thrilled with this case it 's very well made , room for just about everything but the kitchen sink ... it 's exactly what he needed we truly appreciate the great product and the fantastic service
it is the second one for me the first one have been stolen thus i bought a second one it is a little <unk> quality compared with the old one but the difference is negligible for me it is almost perfect
lightweight but study , this case held the following items : surge protector power <unk> <unk> <unk> top power supply # port hub and power <unk> access pocket for pens , folders , paperwork , etc . rolls easily and the handles extend and retract smoothly
this is a perfect laptop plus roller bag it holds my # & # # ; hp laptop as well as magazines , newspapers , notes , my phone and computer charger cords , and even a bottle of water it rolls very easily and the <unk> handle works smoothly fitting it under the seat ahead is a bit of a challenge , but it can be done the construction is strong and i anticipate using this bag for years to come
i really like this bag it is roomy yet i can find things in it it holds everything i need and there is ample room for a change of clothes if i am staying overnight handle collapses easily with one push of a button
my husband needed something to get from building to building on campus , and this is the perfect size for an instructor sturdy , and the <unk> makes it easy to maneuver -- no heavy lifting as with an attach & eacute ; or backpack
i looked for a while to find this case it 's setup well with enough storage for work same case at the office big box stores was over $ # saved a ton of $ $ on this thru amazon
i purchased this portfolio case for hauling my textbooks and laptop computer to my graduate program classes the case is solid and makes the process of traveling to campus and in between classes to be extremely efficient i am so glad i purchased the case it is well constructed , roomy , and well designed i love the handle and pull up bar features
i purchased this , because i purchased a sleek new # inch laptop i am extremely happy with the padding and the many pockets for carrying all that items i need to carry when i have my laptop i found that the quality did not disappoint
it rolls well , and the zippers are nice and sturdy there are lots of pockets for organization the handle extends easily with a comfortable length it is just basic black and i like my luggage easy to spot , so i am having mine monogrammed
this case is excellent , so far i pack a lot into it and , it has been over rough roads - which means the harsh <unk> winter holds up very well
have had this bag for over a year now , and love it the bag itself is light not a road warrior any more , so do n't drag it around for miles , but the roller wheels seems pretty sturdy enough nooks and crannies for everything you could need have a # & # # ; laptop , and it fits in perfectly for # & # # ; laptops , you might need to put in some extra padding bag looks good too ca n't use it for overnight trips but that 's because it is small enough to fit in the overhead cabin or under your seat so not an issue for me
very disappointed with this purchase not only was shipping charge not shown when ordering the product , the cost of the shipping charge was nearly as much as the product , itself would not have ordered had i known this was not a & # # ; prime & # # ; eligible purchase further , not as advertised , this bag is too small for my # & # # ; dell laptop too much freight to send it back , so just have to use it as a rolling <unk> or something
these really are great bags unfortunately , when i saw this bag , and checked out where the laptop goes , there is no padding for the base of the laptop they should have included a layer of padding , like they do with the carrying version of this bag i think the pull bars resting right under the laptop over time , is going to create `` wear and tear `` marks unless i 'm missing something i agree with another poster not easy to put in and remove the laptop you literally have to strap it in but , i 'll make do with it it is a nice bag
this product is advertised as accommodating # inch laptops well , that is not really an accurate statement i was able to get my # inch laptop to fit into the bag but it is not in the dedicated laptop compartment i had to move it to the slot directly in front of the dedicated laptop compartment overall , the bag does fit all of the books and materials i need for a full day of classes in law school -lrb- including my laptop in the <unk> compartment -rrb-
the bag overall has performed well but i have an hp envy # laptop it does not fit into the intended location for a laptop i have to put it into the center area designed for files other than that , it works as a mobile office with a small space for a single change of clothes if you pack everything tight
i work as a consultant and travel to different facilities have my laptop , binder , handouts , and some reference books in the bag and they just fit i 'm thinking about <unk> my binder which is # . # inches otherwise the bag is great wheels great , looks great handle is great pockets are designed well with obvious use for all -lrb- i.e . cell phone , usb port , pens , accordion pockets in center compartment are great i usually can fit a water bottle in it too
swissgear granada # wheeled computer case - my # `` dell vostro does not fit my computer is # . # x # . # x # . # seems like a nice bag and i 've always gotten my money 's worth from wenger so i am <unk> disappointed i will have to return this bag the hunt goes on
this has been a good bag wish i had seen it before making purchase the only reason i have an issue , is size i carry so many catalogs and paper work i really needed a computer bag with a built in filing cabinet if you need to carry a computer a a couple binders and few files , this is your bag
great bag , looks great fits all , if only the wheels would be better something got stuck and blocked a wheel , i kept pulling the bag and part of the wheel got <unk> next time i will buy something with larger wheels if you use this bag mainly at the airport or on other smooth surfaces this is perfect
the most important thing that i dislike about this case is that it is not comfortable to put or to take may sony <unk> # . # `` laptop to/from it also it is heavier than i expected
this bag would be perfect if it fit my laptop it is good quality and looks sleek i luckily had a laptop sleeve so i can still use it but it barely fits and not in the designated laptop section thinks carefully if you have a # . # screen before buying because my computer is the average size of other # . # screens that i have seen
because i am <unk> and still able to travel , i chose this bag so it would be easier for me to get around without lugging a tote i like this particular bag because it is well made , has a place for my computer and still has plenty of room for carry on items
rolls nicely , no tipping when loaded lots of outside pocket space for pens , paper and laptop accessories my only complaint is i 'm tired of manufacturers always putting in a clothes space for having a rolling briefcase , why would i need clothes space , but they all seem to add it in i would rather have had that extra space with dividers for folders or other types of pockets
i wanted a bag with wheels but not as big as the general standards this bag is excellent , but it 's bigger than the one shown in the photos on amazon it could be a little bit smaller , then it would fit beneath the seats of almost every plane it has a lot of storage , which is good , but for some purposes is bigger than i wanted it to be this is the only negative aspect of it , for the rest , it is great
this bag is nice for my purposes -- it holds my laptop , files , cables , headphones , and other gear i need on the road i use the back area for carrying cables , mouse , headphones , power cable , etc instead of for clothes and shoes so , i have everything i need when i 'm on the road my only <unk> are that some of the pockets do n't <unk> well the front pocket where i keep my mp # player , pens & pencils , employee id etc is really hard to access quickly without opening the zippers quite far same goes for the laptop pocket which is hard to access quickly otherwise , it is doing the job
only issue i have is back compartment is set up to use for clothing rather than file storage or component storage that was n't clear in the description other than that , works great and i can live with the back compartment
i purchased this for my son for christmas he is more than pleased with the size and quality of the bag he fit his # & # # ; laptop in with no problem
i purchased this as a gift for my husband who is # ' # & # # ; the extra length in the handle is perfect and the amount of space and pockets seem to be working out well
<unk> is not too big i was worried it may be as big as a carry on for a plane but it is the perfect size to take to college and carry all those books without looking like i am traveling
i love this bag because it 's the perfect size for my work materials i travel all over for work and i find that i can fit all my junk -lrb- work related and personal -rrb- in the one bag
this is a great case for larger notebook computers has enough space for the computer , plus a generous amount of space for other materials as well wheels move well , the handle retracts and extends easily seems sturdy enough , tho has n't really been <unk> yet arrived promptly and without any problems less than buying from a big box office supply store would use this seller again
this is a great bag i travel quite a bit and have been through several lap top cases and this one appears to be the one plenty of room and well <unk> if i had a complaint and i do n't , it would be nice if it were a bit lighter but i suppose that comes from how well it is built
i love this brand of case i have one that has lasted me several years and thought i was purchasing a replacement as i am extremely hard on things however , -lrb- my own fault -rrb- i did n't read the description in that this is not the # inch laptop case ... but my husband is <unk> it ! so , until mine comes down in price , i guess i 'll just have to keep it on my wish list
this bad is great i have been using this bad for about # months or longer and i have nothing bad to say there is plenty of room for my laptop , ipad , wireless mouse , folders , chargers , etc . great product ! !
this bag is everything i expected i travel by air once a month and love this bag for many reasons it will handle two # & # # ; laptops heavy duty rollers and
i hated the travelpro , even though it was well made this bag is great the handle is long enough so that i do n't kick it with my heel -lrb- travelpro complaint -rrb- the laptop compartment is toward the <unk> so that bag weight is distributed travelpro tipped forward i just hope that the wheels do n't fail all in all , a great bag
think this is a really good buy and am excited to use this for years to come lots of room and pockets fit all school books and laptop pretty easily really well made
this bag is perfect for my new laptop ; it has lots of space , is easy to handle and fits well on an aircraft it has a durable outer and the interior is well laid out
this is the second case i have owned the first case was subjected to daily use and heavy loads , computer , portable printer , small scanner , <unk> and more the extension handle eventually broke but the bag itself is sturdy the case lasted # years of business related use
laptop , charger , mouse , tablet in a case , water bottle , and other assorted stuff - all in a well built case great deal for the money roomy enough for your stuff , but not an <unk> size glad i bought it
this was a gift for my wife she wanted something to haul her lap top , files and potentially put an overnight 's worth of clothing in the wenger granada does all these things with great efficiency i wanted her to have a rolling bag that would last and i think we have found that attribute with the functionality in the wenger granada
perfect for my school needs lots of space and compartments my doctor recommended a rolling bag instead of a back pack since i have a few <unk> discs in my lower back and this has helped so much i researched quite a few bags and the quality of the wheels were something i was looking to last awhile and on different ground surfaces , as i go to school in the city i 've been using it for over a month now and it has held up very well the handle , zippers , material and total quality of the bag is superb i paid about $ # plus $ # for shipping . # stars !
i 'll start by saying i really like this bag and after a lot of debate decided to keep it the major issue i have with this bag is its size the specs on this bag claim that it will hold up to a # inch laptop it does but just barely while the bag can hold a # inch laptop , the zipper appears to be a # inch zipper each time i put my computer in the bag i have to jiggle and stretch the bag to get my computer into it that said , i really like the material , the feel of the bag and the overall look it is attractive and fun
we purchased this for my daughter 's # `` laptop the bag is very protective and she loves the <unk> unfortunately , the sleeve is too small to accommodate her laptop i had read this in reviews and measured to be sure her particular laptop would fit despite stated dimensions , it did not for her it is not a problem she just puts her <unk> in the sleeve and the laptop in the bag and it works out overall great product , but the sleeve should be sized more <unk>
the most cute laptop case i 've ever had and he most practical too i 've used it for many years now and have never had a complaint excellent product and instant delivery service
i absolutely love this bag the only problem is that it was not big enough for my laptop , it was about # inch too small it made it too tight to get my laptop in and out of the bag i <unk> getting a new laptop , that is how much i love this bag reluctantly i sold it to a friend
i 've bought this laptop case to my girlfriend for christmas and she just loved it she was looking for something cool , different from the conventional cases and backpacks enought space for some extra stuff and for her laptop nice fashion design and good quality
this product is great for toting around your laptop , cords , and other items the material has some `` give `` to it , so that you can fit all of your items in , but it never stretches out the sleeve , though it can be removed , is more effective if you leave it in the bag , using it as a <unk> in the bag the sleeve is hard on one side to provide stability to the bag and soft on the other side so that it fits and securely holds all types of laptops on the soft side are two large stretchy pockets , perfect for holding cords , and a smaller stretchy pocket , nice for holding a cell phone
pretty good all the way around but if your hauling a big laptop its gon na be snug make sure you check the dimensions of your rig before ordering one of these quality wise , great strap , great material , great look , good price for what we got my wife used this for grad school with a full sized notebook -lrb- she turned the computer sideways and had it sticking out the top for # years -rrb- , and they all three survived the case and strap held up just fine
i think it looks way better in the picture - i did not like how it looks at all the laptop sleeve -lrb- inside -rrb- does not close , for this reason i do n't think you could use the bag and the sleeve separated - the sleeve will not be safe without the whole bag
the description says this case fits a # `` computer , which is what mine <unk> across however , i have a # . # `` screen -lrb- <unk> -rrb- and it does not fit the case the case , however , is great if my computer fit , it would be a perfect solution for lightweight travel with great protection
i like that there is a removable sleeve and that it does n't add a lot of weight to an already heavy laptop the `` stash `` places are great on the inner sleeve - place to put cell phone etc .
excellent lap top bag functional , sturdy and stylish holds macbook and about # thin files love the separate sleeve that comes out so you can just carry the laptop separately great price too
built ny makes really useful and stylish items i own a lot of their stuff and this bag is just the latest item to impress me this bag has a great insert for keeping a laptop and all the cords that travel with it the insert held the computer and cords so the rest of the bag was clutter free i also used this bag walking in one of the # <unk> and it kept my computer safe and sound
purchased this product at the end of january looking for a good laptop briefcase to hold a # & # # ; laptop with plenty of room for files and # binder in may -lrb- # months -rrb- one of the handles ripped off shortly after the shoulder pad started for fray and eventually tore off i guess i expected more from a brand such as samsonite i would not recommenced this product to anyone who actually wants to carry anything maybe if you want to leave it empty and look cool
the lower zipper at the front became & # # ; unzipped and <unk> & # # ; after a few weeks the shoulder pad on the shoulder strap did n't last much longer it 's a shame for what is otherwise a nice bag
the bag is a great item , it 's the second one i 've had have loved and used it for years this one had a metal piece where the strap connects to the bag that stripped out the first time i used it bad luck or bad item
this is a roomy , durable laptop bag easily and securely fits laptop , power cords , and numerous files and/or books , along with pens , highlighters , business cards , etc . the shoulder strap on this model is more securely fastened than on some other samsonite models i have used this bag for a long time and have had absolutely no problems with it i wish i could say the same for other samsonite bags
i got this as a substitute for my roller overall , very functional , durable , and light weight pockets are enough to take all my gadgets : phone and charger , video cam and charger , camera , mouse , batteries , laptop and charger , ... etc .
i love this briefcase it has everything you could possibly want to carry what you need it has all kinds of pockets for storage of pens , business cards , laptop , files , etc . i do n't know what i would do without this case i love it ! buy one and you 'll see for yourself as always , from amazon , it was shipped nicely with no damage and ahead of time on <unk>
from what i can tell , the product description does not match the actual product the actual product does not include `` # . harness <unk> easy access to mp # player or mobile phone `` that is described in the description the <unk> from the bag i received is # # the tag says <unk> # not sure if there are two version of this bag , or an old version and a new version , but in any even the product description is not accurate
i bought this bag and the <unk> bp # camera and laptop backpack in preparation for a trip for which i need to take my laptop and camera equipment in my carry-on they are both really nice bags , but i decided to keep the <unk> because the fastpack # had fewer pockets , is not as versatile and the straps were n't quite as comfortable the pros to the fastpack # are that it 's lighter , the camera compartment seems better designed and the opening to the laptop pocket is bigger so it 's easier to get your laptop in it
i took this on a <unk> and it worked well held two camera bodies , lens , and personal items had the one body attached to a cannon # lens when in the pack extra room on top was nice for batteries , charger , etc . . had some problems with bottom pocket zipper , but it is still functional -lrb- seemed to jam a bit -rrb- a good size when carrying two bodies the side pocket was nice for a water bottle -lrb- could be a bit deeper though -rrb- recommend this pack
i have a tamrac <unk> # sling bag , but wanted to get a full size bag for travel and for bringing more gear this bag <unk> has a lot of room i can fit my camera with a # mm f # . # lens on it inside the compartment it will also fit other lenses and accessories , plus a laptop the camera is accessible through the side pocket without taking off the bag . and the other accesories in the compartment are safe while quick drawing your camera i wish it had some external straps or connectors for a tripod etc . go to the lowepro site to see all sorts of pictures and videos on what fits in it
pros : rugged , plenty of room , well padded and comfortable , fits all my gear cons : wasted space on the top , no place for <unk> pack tough enough that i feel it will last me a long time no place for a tripod unless you get creative
fits my thinkpad with the extended oversize battery well with room for power adapter in with laptop plenty of camera room and the top compartment carries all my tools , cables , cds/dvds , ipod , headphones , etc . . comfortable even with all the weight from all the gear
took this pack to the west coast for a couple of weeks it holds a huge amount of camera gear plus my # in . laptop of course , it became a little heavy at times when weighed down so much but that was to be expected it went through airport security checks well , however , i did find it a little difficult to fit under the plane seat when packed fully i had received many compliments on this bag due to it 's professional look wish it would have had a way to attach a tripod at the bottom of the pack , like a couple of attachment loops i would have thought that it would have but even without it , it has proved to be a sturdy , well designed pack overall
the fastpack # is just as advertised , space for my # <unk> # and # other lenses along with my <unk> # and several lenses for that camera as well it has both shoulder and waist adjustable straps and carries very easily on your back this item is well paded for equipment protection and also contains a rain flap over the camera compartment i highly recommend this product for travel and all around storage
this is a great product purchased to help me carry laptop and camera on recent vacation when i needed to use crutches due to an injury allowed me to navigate the airport where i would n't have been able to with the crutches and separate laptop and camera bags
this is a great backpack i needed something to carry my camera and lenses , laptop computer , chargers and adapters , and lots of personal items for a planned sightseeing trip to england this was a perfect purchase it is spacious , has special padded area for camera and lenses , and safe storage for my laptop good looking , unbelievably sturdy , and at a good amazon price
in today 's world , when traveling , we have become dependent on a variety of electronic tools to use to enjoy and document the travels i have a laptop , an ipad , an iphone , an ipod , a digital camera , assorted power supplies , and camera lenses i needed a pack that could do carry all this comfortably and be usable for when you see that perfect shot and want to reach for the camera this backpack clearly meets that need i could have gone with the # which is slightly smaller , and would have met most of my <unk> travel needs but for convenience and one pack handling , the # is great for overseas trips i have consolidated from three carryon 's which i fit into one roller bag carry on to meet the airline <unk> , to just this backpack well made and durable
i did n't think i needed this large of bag as i am just a beginner when it comes to photography but when i started putting everything in there , it works perfect also , i have a # & # # ; laptop that fits perfectly in the bag as well as my ipod seems like it will keep all my photo and electronic equipment safe
it is constructed well and will hold a laptop and a camera body and a few accessories , but after that things get tight there is no room left over a book my battery grip will fit while on the camera only if there is no laptop there is n't a space for a water bottle , nor a spot for keys these little things can be important if there were an extra large size , with about # inches more depth -lrb- front to back -rrb- and about the same in length , i would find the bag much more useful
i have taken this bag on many trips it protects my gear and has enough space for my camera -lrb- nikon d # -rrb- plus flash , lenses , filters , charger , extra batteries , and my laptop i like that it does not look like a camera bag it is comfortable after a couple years of use , it still looks new - no rips , easy to wipe off any dirt
i love this bag there 's enough room to shove a camera body , # mm lens , and two other medium size lenses ... a flash , chargers , cables , fold up <unk> and a small laptop or tablet it 's well built and feels good to carry it does get a bit heavy after a long day of travel ... but what bag would n't when it 's full of photo gear i ca n't imagine there is a better messenger bag out there at this price point
only problem i had with this bag was that it tipped over , but then i realized that i had stuffed it too full on one side it is a great bag and i like the fact that i can carry my <unk> pro and my large dslr in the middle , fully padded and protected it works great the handle seems substantial too , and that 's good because this bag weighs a lot when its got everything in it
beautifully made case and the pockets are a very nice touch the problem i have with it though is the zipper is like a <unk> and it 's pretty much impossible to slide my # & # # ; macbook pro retina into it without dragging the zippers over the laptop it 's a real bummer and i plan to return this because of it
this product was great except for the packing from the distributor if it was n't for the lower price compared to ny 's website pricing and amazon 's free shipping , i would 've returned this product when i received the sleeve it was folded in half and stuffed in a small box therefore , there is a distinctive wrinkle down the front of the sleeve it <unk> me out a lot when i see it
i bought this for my # . # inch laptop , after making sure the dimensions of the case matched my laptop however even after that making sure everything was fine , my laptop had a hard time fitting into the case because of the <unk> shape of the case , the laptop had a tough time fitting in properly the padding was n't enough either , it would probably be enough to protect the laptop against scratched but not from bumping around or any hard hits overall : i did n't like the fitting or the make of it , with the way it was described by other people , therefore i returned it it 's an ideal case for those who would like to protect their laptop from scratches
