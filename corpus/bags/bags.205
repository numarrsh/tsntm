this was a gift for my brother-in-law he was very happy with it , it was exactly what he wanted i was happy with the delivery time as well as the price and everything that came with it if someone were looking for that gift i would recommend they try going through <unk> on amazon
i feel it got exactly what i paid for with this it is n't anything amazing but for $ # it fits perfectly and will protect the cover it 's light , thin and feels nice too i could have skipped the keyboard cover and screen protector but they see fine as a throw in i probably wont use them
ok , i 'll be honest my daughter ordered this but when i saw it i thought about how wonderful it is - now she can eat and drink to her heart 's content as she <unk> the web , no sweat nothing will <unk> or collect in the keyboard
arrived quickly and as expected the outside cover and keyboard cover are exactly as i had hoped my only complaint is that i wish the scream protector went on more smoothly and clearly otherwise , i 'm very happy with this purchase
i hesitated a bit on purchasing due to the mixed reviews but , i love my macbook case i got all # pieces in purple and it adds personality to my mac i have received many complements from various co-workers keep up the good job !
i got this for my mother and she loves it , this case protects great and is the same as the $ # i got from apple the keyboard cover is great and is durable
love how the black case looks with the silver macbook at first i had trouble with the bottom part of the case but i realized i just had n't locked it into place not a big fan of the screen protector because it makes the screen look a bit <unk> but it serves its purpose everything else is great about this product
fits like a glove and i love the orange color since is my favorite color and i have no problem finding my laptop now when i put it somewhere and have to go looking for
the cover is great love the color and the turn around time receiving it the item was here the next day at no extra cost to me , price in general was awesome too

i ordered a pink one for myself and this one for my boyfriend he loved it it looks just as it does in the picture i could not be happier with my purchase
this was a xmas # gift for my father he loves it he immediately put it on his precious macbook pro screen protector fits nicely as well the color is a very nice blue i 'm very happy with my
this being the first case i 've put on a macbook pro , i was n't sure i 'd even like it turns out i love it the keyboard cover changes the feel of the keys , but still allows the backlighting through the screen cover was n't my thing and i pulled it off after # minutes , but it functioned as it should - just a matter of personal preference
very happy with the product easy to install , color exactly as listed i was worried that the keyboard cover would make it difficult to type , but it does not very easy to
i 've been using this case for a while now and it 's great dropped my laptop once and it took the hit which saved my laptop from any damage plus , i really like the way it looks
i am really happy with the cover ! it fits perfectly on my computer , and even came with screen covers this case is great quality for the low price , compared to others at electronic stores for $ # . # definitely worth the buy
sure , the case does n't have a truly rubber feel it also is n't up to par with the cases that cost # times more but for less than $ # you can not take away from the great value this product presents it fits great , the screen protector does what it 's supposed to do , and the keyboard cover keeps all the things that usually get between your keys away from the keys could n't be happier with the modest investment to protect my macbook
just as nice as the ones that are # bucks at best buy great buy ! ! and the keyboard cover is awesome <unk> down the light up keyboard a little but still keeps it clean !
case fit perfectly and install was very simple , looks good the keyboard fits well and does not obstruct my typing i did not use the included screen cover yet , so i ca n't comment on that , i tried applying it but dust makes it difficult this case does n't feel quite as `` rubberized `` as other cases i have seen , but other than that i have no complaints
i am very pleased with my new laptop cover it 's durable , a great color , and this was a great deal because it came not only with the case but also with a keyboard cover and a screen cover now the screen cover is n't too great so i am not using that , but i love everything else it was a great price and it came quickly in the mail would recommend this to anyone
i really enjoy it completely changes the look of my mac and the keyboard cover keeps dog fur , dust and other stuff off it 's fantastic i will admit , it does look cheap , but it works for what i want
the case fits very well and the key covers also lay very nicely it is a little bit more pink than it is in the picture , but it 's still a nice color i have n't ever seen anyone else with one this color , and i really like it
the color is perfect and looks like it does in the picture it fits great and its exactly what i wanted i love the whole package the screen protector is the icing on the cake
this has worked perfectly for my computer snapped right on i like the keyboard cover too it almost <unk> to the keyboard so i do n't have to worry about anything getting in there
this was just what i was looking for came within # days on standard shipping great product ! the letters on the keyboard cover do n't quite match up with the letters in the keyboard but that does n't bother me
so far so good nothing has gone wrong yet with my computer of course nothing is going to be wrong with my case and everything since i got it today , but i am very pleased with what i bought and i got everything i paid for i love the color and everything ! i also posted pics of what mine looks like
i had another blue hard case for my macbook pro that i bought over a year ago and it is not even on the same level as this case this case has an amazing & # # ; rubber-like & # # ; feel and just looks very expensive additionally , i love the screen protector previously , i was getting the print of the keyboard onto my screen from my keyboard cover ; however the protector keeps that from happening this is a great set
this thing right here is amazing i would n't trade it for anything i am glad to have something so special like this anyone who is reading this believe me its the best
the case looks amazing on my computer the keyboard cover fits perfectly i had to adjust to typing on it but overall i love it i had a little trouble putting the screen protector on i was unable to get all of the bubbles out but i 'm still satisfied it still protects my screen so that 's more important
quick and free shipping -- ca n't beat the deal i love the color , it was accurately described the case is lightweight and it was easy to snap on the rubberized finish is sleek -- much nicer looking than sheer plastic cases it also came with a screen protector i am very pleased with this purchase
i love this case it fits perfectly i was a little apprehensive since i am a new mac user it is awesome the keyboard cover is even better now , i do n't have to worry about greasy fingers messing up my key board ! lol . :
i have a # macbook pro and this case fit perfectly as did the keyboard protector i am not going to use the screen protector -lrb- i didnt want it , but since it came with it for free i cant complain -rrb- the cover is a nice light purple color and the keyboard protector is a bit more pinkish than purple but again no complaints shipped fast and product looks great and was a great price ! !
ordered this case for my mac to keep it clean the case fit perfectly and i received it without a scratch the keyboard protecter takes time to get used to , the buttons feel and require a little more force when pushing down on the bottoms , but it is not a big deal i rather have the keyboard protected people ca n't even tell i have a key board protector on
i freaking love this case . its bright and looks awesome on my computer . it is totally worth the money . in the apple store they cost soooo much <unk> ! ! great deal ! love
product material is cheap but it works there were hard parts of removing the keypad from the plastic where it was really stuck onto the plastic and installing the screen protector was challenging where i want to avoid any bubbles after installing all three to my mac , it works as describes in my experience keyboard protector protects any dust getting inside the keyboards , screen protector reduces glare during <unk> and does n't interfere watching videos in the night , and case fits fine with no difficulty only problem is that it leaves fingerprints when you grab onto overall , great buy for something that is less than $ # to protect an expensive machine
i questioned whether i should purchase this item because of mixed reviews however , once i received it and snapped it onto my macbook pro i knew i made the right choice it fits great , provides plenty of ventilation on the bottom and protects it in addition , you get the keyboard guard and glare <unk> for your screen sure , the keyboard cover is very thin but it works fine i paid $ # for one that was just a bit <unk> and this one feels better to the touch i would definitely recommend this item as a must buy
needless to say you really need a hard shell case or cover for this laptop this is a good option - the clear case fits and seems to protect the computer well but it is a bit heavy - i 'm not saying it 's made out of lead but you probably got this laptop because it 's one of the lightest on the market
as the only option for this particular toshiba portege , i was skeptical about the quality when first purchasing ; but this case has worked fine it snaps on and is easy to remove it does add some noticeable bulk but it still fit in my slip case i would ' t keep it on all the time , since i did pick this computer for its lightweight design , but it is good for travel
i was questionable at first about this case being able to protect such a fragile laptop i am sure you are as well and that is why you are reading these reviews i have owned the case for a few weeks now and it has done an excellent job protecting my portege laptop initially i was anti having a case , but this laptop is extremely fragile so i had to purchase a case and chose the ipearl the shipping was extremely fast and the customer service was excellent i definitely recommend this product and will return if i ever need any future cases
this item is awesome ! ! provides excellent protection and offers a nice kick stand for effective usage i have like every color the customer service is also wonderful one of my orders had the wrong size sent and ipearl took care of it right away simple and easy for me to get the mix up corrected easy snap on and off protective case love it ! ! !
bought two of these for two different ultrabooks they fit perfect , and have not broken yet they add a bit of weight -lrb- about a pound -rrb- to the <unk> ultrabook , but at least i wo n't get my fingerprints on the shiny metal casing i like to keep my things new , and glad that there is at least one product -lrb- so far -rrb- that can do the job for me thanks ipearl for making this , when it seems <unk> else has
while the top half of the shell fits great , the bottom half -- not so much one side just barely does n't fit properly and it 's a bit annoying i do love the built-in legs that allow for airflow underneath , and the color is great and exactly as pictured it does help with making the monitor feel less flimsy i just wish that one side would fit better on the bottom
if you want to add some protection , make monitor feel less flimsy and use the legs to help ventilate then this case works like other reviews have stated , the top half fits great however the bottom left corner will not stay snapped on . the snapping on and off is rather annoying i did contact the ipearl staff and they sent me another bottom piece in an effort to correct the problem i was disappointed because this new bottom piece is exactly the same - still snaps on and off
the color purple was as i expected although the cover does n't cover my ultra-book as i wish it does the area where one can put cd 's is totally exposed i do n't know why it is like this , since an ultra-book does n't use cd 's but it does make the lid a bit more sturdy , and there is a lot of space for ventilation on the bottom
so , <unk> nothing of the cover , i was just disappointed with the lack of options available for the toshiba portege i ordered this because it was the only thing i could find so , i do n't love the color options and i 'd ideally want something that protects the keyboard better however , for what this is , it works well i like the protection , the feet can be handy , and it fits well i 'd recommend returning it if it does n't fit , since it should four stars because the plastic is super light -lrb- feels a little flimsy -rrb- , but it also very little extra weight maybe that 's a plus
bought this for my daughters laptop and its done a great job of protecting the laptop it fits perfectly and the color is fun i would n't drop it from any particular hight but definitely works for the typical bumps and rough handling a # year old can <unk> upon it
the green is like a jelly bean ... sort of fun and translucent i have been very happy with this case and so far , it is protecting my toshiba well from bangs
i do enjoy this laptop case it is a pleasant color , but looks like it is cheaply made on the bottom there are little stands to make the laptop sit differently , but it works out really well it is a little loud when setting up and moving the stands it has little & # # ; <unk> & # # ; bubbles on the top that are a little unnecessary
first off the toshiba ultrabook that this was purchased for really is great but it is so light that i felt that some additonal security was a good think found this cover and said let 's give it a go , i 'm so glad i did this case fits like a glove , snaps into place and has no play to make it feel loose the color looks good and does n't show fingerprints like one would think for a clear cover the weight adds about a half a pound to the # . # pound # inch portege but it 's still feels lighter than my old lenovo s # and the screen is soooo much better if you have this computer and take it around the house or around the world get this case you will thank me for the security
it 's been good so far the clips in front rub on my arms when i hold the laptop on my lap so i have to be carful clips on well though - better than the original case i purchased
affordable , sturdy and doing the job , i love the color too the keyboard cover feels funny so i only use it when in storage , but it 's a nice add on
the only thing about it is that the clips on the bottom sometimes scratch my arms when i am typing otherwise , fits great and the keyboard cover stays , unlike a lot of others that peel
purple color is a bit light , would n't choose it again the keyboard cover fits very well but removed it after a while because it is slightly grippy and impedes quick typing easy to place on the computer , good access to all ports and does not impede the opening of the screen as other cases
i baby my computer and this case already has a significant crack in the corner after a month of use it started as a small crack after a week and has since grown to the point that a piece is almost falling off i have never dropped or mistreated my computer so i assume it 's just poor craftsmanship i give it # star for looks other than that i am disappointed in the quality and the fact that it is almost useless after a month additionally , the keyboard cover does not fit well and is also of poor quality , but figured that would be the case when i bought it and did n't really want it to begin with
i thought it was more of a & # # ; silicone & # # ; base product so the laptop would n't slip from hands it was a cheap hard plastic and not what i wanted nor expected sorry , but i would not recommend this product #
the case fits nicely the keyboard cover on the other hand does not seem to fit snug enough which makes typing a bit difficult the keyboard cover looks cute and does a decent job of letting the backlight through
finally a case that fits the bottom comes off easily just by lifting the laptop with the monitor opened , which is annoying at times when the case got to me , the bottom case had a dent which makes the case look weird ... it has a gap ... anyways , i am done trying to find cases i probably will recommend this ... but with the dent i do n't know if they did that on purpose to just send me a poor quality one or it became dented during its journey here
this case is pretty good , it came fast , the only problem i have is the keyboard cover , it blocks out the caps lock light , and the space bar portion tends to lift up after a
this is the perfect case i love it ! ! it was just what i was looking for it covers my mac perfectly i ca n't wait to order more stuff from this awesome company i would recommend them to everyone awesome product for the price ! !
the product lived up to its description it also arrived earlier than anticipated i would recommend this to anyone interested in ` <unk> up ' their laptop i did not expect to like the keyboard cover as much as i do - a <unk> bonus
my daughter bought this case for the new macbook pro retina and she loves it the color is great and the keyboard cover works just fine it is a little difficult to take back off but it should n't be a problem overall a great buy would recommend this case
ca n't comment on how it holds up if moving around a lot as i just use them in my classroom to help keep track of which macbook is which i dislike the keyboard covers in general so i do n't use
this is a cheap hard case construction gives the appearance that it is made out of premium materials however upon looking at the real thing i became really disappointed seller really should have had more pictures of a higher resolution and larger size so as to not <unk> the purchaser i shipped it back the following day i received it not worth it ! i actually lost money in this transaction ! !
it is less a sleeve -lrb- which <unk> a flexible material -rrb- and more a cheap case it feels like card board with a stiched outer layer i use it because i am too lazy to buy something else but i would not recommend this item
i received a new google chromebook for christmas and then purchased this the same day because it said it would fit i does fit but it wo n't latch shut there is a magnet that closes at the top but if the chromebook is in , it will not close it still fits inside so really it 's a matter of preference
very well packaged from amazon ; it arrived quickly excellent quality and well made however , i bought this for my new # & # # ; samsung chromebook , but the sleeve is too small and did not fit the chromebook it would be perfect for a macbook air unfortunately , i had to return the sleeve
this sleeve is exactly what i was looking for : something slim , sleek , yet sturdy i needed something to store it in around the house when the computer is not in use but something i can quickly drop into a shoulder bag on the go the <unk> are firm and thick enough that i feel like my macbook air will be protected if i should drop my bag and the laptop hits on the <unk> the three ridges on both sides of the outside make me think it would hold up well if i dropped the laptop flat the magnetic closure is awesome it holds the laptop in when turned upside down but still lets you pull the laptop out quickly i was worried the sleeve would be too <unk> , but it 's exactly what i was looking for : pliable but firm the sleeve does n't offer any padding , but it is a pretty hard shell the only con : my cat likes to <unk> the tag cat owners be warned
i ordered this after it was recommended on the play store website and wanted it to protect my newly purchased samsung chromebook i had read mixed reviews on the case so was a little leary at first but am now very happy that i decided to place my order the booq hardcase fits my new chromebook like a glove and offers the protection i was looking for as a note , it does not fit my original samsung chromebook series # but fits the new samsung model being sold perfectly the case is well made , durable and looks good enough to be carried into the office perfect size to carry your chromebook onto an airplane and fit into the seat back during take off and landing and and durable enough to provide excellent protection of your prized device the case also includes pockets inside to hold important documents and other items of a small flat nature not big enought to carry your charger inside but great for day use i highly recommend this case to anyone with a new chromebook looking to protect it without spending a small fortune or more than their chromebook costs
this is an awesome bag , can hold laptop and textbooks for school canvas is very durable and easy access pockets are handy i am a nursing student and can say this is a great alternative to the typical backpack it is very spacious and will hold everything i need for the day
this bag is awesome it is well made , roomy , and stylish to boot i ca n't wait to take it on my trip it is large enough to fit all the essentials but small enough to carry easily the materials are high quality and like i said , it more than met my expectations ... it exceeded them also , the seller shipped the bag very quickly and was very accommodating with my shipping request thank you , seller
i purchased this bag for my husband who was <unk> me for a cool messenger bag when it arrived i was jealous i wanted him to hate it so i could keep it for myself but boy was i wrong he absolutely love this bag every compartment is zippered so he feels confident nothing will fall out while riding his bike i will be getting one for myself
very well made heavy duty zippers lots of compartments bought this for a carry on for a trip to texas holds all electronics including ipad , books , and all plugs with plenty of other room i have been looking for a bag that did n't look like a girls bag this is it well worth the money and would recommend to a friend
got tired of the ever growing wallet bulging in my pocket and needed something to carry my ipad and note ii this bag is the ideal thing to carry it all and some it has become my & # # ; murse & # # ;
fits _ perfectly _ for my asus u # sg , even with the bigger battery hence it 's not bulky at all feels protective but the foam leaves some marks on my laptop -lrb- i 'm sure they can be rubbed away , though
made of high quality materials and has a very smooth zipper i live the bubbles on the inside as they keep my laptop from <unk> around it is defiantly meant to go inside a larger case or bag however , and not to be used alone as it has no handle it served my purpose
it 's actually a little bigger than # i fit a # incher with a very small bezel with just a little squeezing , so there 's that for you if you have a # inch macbook air , though , there 'll be some extra space
this fits my toshiba z # ultrabook just right i love the fact that the zipper goes around one side , because i can put it in my bookbag , and actually slide the laptop in and out without having to take out the case
my husband got me a new laptop as a baby present , i bought this to protect the computer i love it , it is soft on the outside and on the inside the computer is really snugly and
great sleeve , love the impact bubbles , top loaded is so convenient a little bit wide for a # . # inch retina macbook pro i feel like the sleeve is made for # inch laptop , but it does n't really slide around too much thanks to the slim fit and impact bubbles great protection , has nice smooth impact bubbles inside the sleeve to protect the <unk> n't have to remove the sleeve to take out the computer -lrb- love this feature <unk> is good <unk> only the size , like i said , it feels like a # inch sleeve , but i ca n't knock a star off , because the pros greatly <unk> the
poor quality for item case had a very strong odor to it sent me the wrong size case twice , and company wanted me to resend it again the whole returning process was tedious and waste of time , poor customer service and feedback the case was cheap , the plastic shell case did not even fit my computer and the plastic screen was useless to small bad experience would not recommend this product
i absolutely love the color of the case , and the fact that there 's a matching keyboard with it , but when i received mine in the mail a part was chipped off the bottom i would order another one , but seeing as i just got this one the # + dollars for a <unk> case i do n't really want to waste another #
i 'm so pissed i leave to go out of town and after paying extra for my case it 's way too big so now i need to order a new one ! !
the first time i ordered the purple one it was sturdy and fit wonderfully , i wanted to switch things up , so i decided to get another case , this time in hot pink , huge mistake its like a completely different case does n't snap all the way on , and even fell off before this is not the same case that i ordered before it has the logo & # # ; tc & # # ; on the bottom right hand corner , my last one did not i refuse to order again
this product lack quality the case i received cracked easily and even broke apart the case does n't add any added protection ; covering up my laptop in a sweater would have provided better protection than the case additionally , the skin does n't fit the keyboard well , even those the details of the product indicate that the skin is suppose to be fitted for the # -in macbook pro i had to buy another case i would recommend not buying the product because it will breakdown and it 's not worth the money , so you will eventually have to buy another case
i have to say i really loved the case when i first bought it but about a week ago the top part of the case got stuck on my computer and literally would not come off in the process of finally prying it off , it scratched up the edges on my computer i am extremely dissatisfied and will not buy from them again
i have ordered it and have been tracking my package all the time my package was returning back on the way , so i e-mail them about it they said that the package was damaged and they will send me a new one asap but the next day , i got an email said that , the order is out of stock and they willing to return the money for me i have been waiting for my money back for over a week ! but i finally got it i feel so disappointed :
i bought this case less than # months ago and the corners of the case are already chipping off on the bottom section i pretty much got this case so i did n't get any scratches on my new laptop , and for that it 's been amazing , however i 'm not sure how well it 's protecting the computer from dings i do love the keyboard cover and have no problems with that whatsoever it has definitely done its job keeping dust and crumbs out of the keyboard the scream protector was difficult to get on like most of them but it seemed to attract dog hair which was not exactly what i wanted and finally the soft case had a harsh smell of plastic so i have n't really been able to use it because of the smell
the sleeve smells really weird i 've had it for quite some time and the smell never did quite go away after only about # months of use , the sleeve started wearing holes in the bottom corner the keyboard protector bothered me and did n't stay on very well i never did figure out how to put on the screen protector worse , the case itself started chipping at all the fastening points , cracking at the corner the yellow is not as pretty as it looks in the pictures , and the case lets dirt in through the cracks , which really bothered me you get what you pay for , and it was okay while it lasted
the # pieces came and were in great shape they were purple instead of blue but i like purple i found i did n't need the keyboard protector but i am keeping the set
i bought this bundle for my new laptop and the case is awful the mouse is very cheap , the neoprene bag smells awful and wrinkles easily , and the hard case is terrible i 've had it for only a month or two and there are like # cracks and several chunks missing out of the corners , and i 've never even dropped it i do not recommend this case at all if you are looking to protect your laptop
this case was fine for about a week until the rubber started to come off , making the case look smudgy and dirty also , it is extremely difficult to take off i nearly scratched my macbook trying to do so the sleeve was a nice touch however , the keyboard protector did not fit
before i placed my order for this case i went through and read a ton of the reviews for this product they pretty much # i decided to order it anyway , its too good of a deal to pass up well in the end you get what you pay for mine was for the # in macbook pro in purple the color is awesome , keyboard cover is great -lrb- hard to get used to -rrb- sleeve is alright ... seems pretty cheap but does that job the case is horrible the bottom piece had about a # inch crack in it neither of the pieces & # # ; snap on & # # ; the fit is rather flimsy buy at your own risk
the case is a pretty <unk> aqua green however , you can tell that the product is cheap i guess you get what you pay for for example ... the bottom case sometimes pops out and the keyboard cover does n't cover the keys perfectly
i love the sleeve for in this set the screen protector is very thick i have n't decided if that 's a good or bad thing but just saying the snap on part of the set collects oil easily and it <unk> it it would n't be that big of a deal if it were a darker green but since it 's so light it shows up lastly i hate the keyboard cover it makes the computer overheat and it 's sticky so it 's hard to type very fast i only use it now when i 'm not typing , more like temporary protection
my granddaughter was excited when she saw this combination for her macbook pro unfortunately the skin was a tad too big we had to send it back and bought one that says it is for the macbook pro with retina display
did n't come in color i wanted ordered purple and got black did n't want to mess with the hassle of returning it and wondering if i reordered if i would get the correct color case fits well otherwise
considering i spent over $ # on my macbook and only $ # ish dollars trying to protect it , it wasnt a bad deal everything is bottom of the line but it gets the job
the top and bottom case are exactly what i wanted , they clip on easily and look great the laptop sleeve is n't the best , it will not protect the laptop the keyboard is cool , kinda hard to type with so i just do n't use it the screen protector is great , it does it 's job all together its not a bad bundle , just do n't expect it to be great
