i could not find any hard cases for macbook pro retina # ' at that time as it was just released the product was delivered earlier than estimated the size is just nice , the color is what i imagined from the photo
fit is perfect , looks great and offers amazing protection looks sleek and adds no real girth to the computers lines the apple logo shows through fine which is nice and it has a nice tactile feel if you want to protect the aluminum body of your macbook get this case
i bought this for my wife 's new # . # a # macbook pro and she loves it we have kids so protecting valuables is a must this cover is nice looking and enhances the look and feel of the mac fit 's perfectly
great little cover it 's not going to save your computer if you drop it but it definitely will protect it from everyday <unk> i feel much better about taking it outside of the house and using it at school plus the rubberized feel is nice to keep a grip on it the apple does shine through too it is n't # % clear it has a little bit of a blue tint to it but it really gets the job done i love all the colors and i ca n't wait to wear this one out and buy a new one
the product is just as described the rubberized mate surface makes the laptop elegant and beautiful , hopefully it was n't shiny like those ` <unk> ' hard cases other <unk> talked about the problem of the fingerprints , ok , sometimes happens , but ir can be easily removed with a damp cloth i 'm very
i ordered this one after i had ordered another brand , same color , cheap plastic and it did n't fit my macbook air # & # # ; so i sent it back i 'm pleased with my purchase , fits great , love the color
the product is excellent it protects well my macbook from scratches , provides good ventilation and firm grip a must to have for a bit expensive macbook pro the seller also found time to send a mail and asked for feedback - a <unk>
nice and smooth , has a problem with building up a little dust but its easy to wipe away i love it thought maybe i would get a keyboard protector but its ok
this case does exactly what was described for it to do i had purchased the <unk> type with rubberized plastic i currently have the late # macbook pro # & # # ; retina model , which fits into the case seamlessly the packaging was a large to medium size amazon box , very secure the product itself was sealed using multiple layers of plastic packaging
i now own # of these and they fit my mac book pro # inch retina late # very well . install takes about # seconds per side . no cooling issues
this product is a perfect fit and great finishing touch it makes the laptop look & # # ; richer & # # ; and changes the outlook as if apple just <unk> a newer model the rubber & # # ; see-through & # # ; keyboard protection makes it a perfect finish on a classic product
this fits my macbook # & # # ; retina so perfectly i 've never had a cover for any of my previous macs and i am so glad i bought this it 's very lightweight and streamline , so it does n't add unwanted bulk i 've had several compliments on how nice it looks - including the royal blue color i 'll be buying covers for my macs from now on
it was not a long wait period like i was expecting so if you want speedy service choose this product i love the texture and the easy snap on came perfect and hopefully it will stay that way
this case fits my brand new # & # # ; mac book pro just snaps right on and looks great also feels smooth and has that velvety finish not that cheap shiny plastic look ... would
i had the speck <unk> case for less than # weeks before the corner pieces snapped off i paid <unk> too much for that case for it to break so soon this case arrived in the mail and already felt sturdier than the speck it is great quality , and i 'd <unk> to say that it 's worth what i paid for the speck that being said , i 'm glad i did n't have to pay that much this case is a great value and i absolutely love the color i # % recommend it
the case fits on my macbook pro # & # # ; retina display late # snuggly you might need a keyboard protector since it only covers the bottom and top of the laptop i use uppercase premium ultra thin keyboard protector for macbook pro with retina
this item is perfect i went through # other cases before i finally found this one it 's exactly as described , the color is just as bright as it is displayed , and it 's so slim it hardly feels like there 's a case on it - but its definitely feels protected could n't be happier was trying to add pictures for those who asked about the back corners being covered , but i 'm not able to the back corners are only covered when the macbook is open when it is closed , the back corners are exposed
i love the way this fits my macbook pro with retina it looks good and protects my computer even when i throw it in my bag to carry it to work
great protective case if you do not like the feeling of scratching your nails against the metallic case of the macbook i choose the clear one it looks nice -lrb- except perhaps the four corners where you can see some uneven <unk> beneath - minor point though -rrb- , very much like the picture the smooth touch is great it protects the laptop from scratches etc but if you 're looking for <unk> covers , you should probably choose some of the harder -lrb- but also heavier -rrb- ones
this case fits good my macbook pro with retina display # -inch not bulky into it and also have all ports open and cut outs for bottom air flow from the side of the mac easy to install and take it of nice protection from dents and scratches i like it
fits perfectly , and the apple logo on the back of the display shines right through the plastic covers all corners , and does not add too much bulk to the already tiny computer great buy in black
initially the fit seemed a bit sloppy but it has never accidentally come off the <unk> of the mbp the finish seems to reveal <unk> and finger prints but those wipe off easily i 've removed it a couple of times to inspect the finish of the mbp and everything is intact , looking like the day i received the computer , so i 'm pleased
red for the # & # # ; macbook pro / retina i get so many comments about how beautiful this case is the trick to putting the cases on is to fit them in the rear <unk> snap them in the front there are two tiny front ` tabs ` on both the upper and <unk> to do this with the only improvement i 'd recommend is add -lrb- # -rrb- <unk> feet at the rear to give the keyboard a slight tilt
i was concerned at first with how thin the cover was when i got it , but the kuzy works wonderfully to protect my laptop from my clumsiness it has survived a couple bumps against a brick wall with no damage to it or my laptop i 'm very happy with this product
i totally love this color , it is just like the picture also , the product does n't feel cheap although the & # # ; apple logo & # # ; is not transparent as it shows on the picture , i do not have requirement on that so it is ok
i 've had almost all cases in the market for the last # years i update my laptop every # months or so and i 've tried all of them and i can tell you that this is the best so far in terms of <unk> it 's pretty much like the incase but for half the price seems durable and fits the computer perfectly i ca n't say the same of some other brands and last but not less important i love the color
this cover gives me peace of mind my expensive little macbook pro is sealed up and safe i will probably order another color but it 's hard to decide which one by the way , the cover was very easy to attach to my mac
the case fits very snug around the computer case is transparent enough to see stickers through it i am very pleased with the quality , look and feel of the case
i have owned this case for a year and a half and it 's still protecting my macbook well this case can take a beating i 'd hate to see what my macbook would look like if i never had a case for it definitely worth buying if you own a macbook
case fits like a glove on my new macbook pro with retina display it 's a hard shell with soft rubberized finish on the outside this allows it to keep still on slick surfaces it is not a rubber case though , it is a hard case as described the color is fantastic , and looks great with the ` giving tree ' decal i placed on it well , i 've been using this case for eight months now , and it is still holding up perfectly i always get compliments for it , and it protects my macbook wonderfully i take it everywhere , and it is still holding up really great product
i absolutely love everything about this kuzy # in macbook pro -lrb- w / retina -rrb- beautiful , bright blue ; very cheerful shipping so fast it was <unk> of i would definitely recommend to friends and family
i 've owned cases by speck before that did not hold up over time and did not add much to the handling of the laptop this case has a grippy , rubbery feel that will save you from dropping it - and it 's quite attractive it also has an <unk> of durability that i did not get from my former , more expensive speck cases thanks for the great product
i got my yellow kuzy cover for my macbook today it looks awesome and it fits really well as i 've only really had it for one day i ca n't really rate it based upon durability but it definitely looks and fits great and i 've already got a lot of compliments
i purchased this for my late model # macbook pro with retina display # inch it fit perfectly , it feels very secure and keeps my system safe , i could not ask for a better product
the product is great it fits my # ' macbook pro with retina display very nicely the color is great and you are still able to see the apple logo on the front although it adds a bit of weight it is n't enough that would make me choose a different one all of the ports are easily accessible i feel my mac is well protected i would reccomend this case to anyone good case for the price
product is great , thanks for the speedy delivery the case is sturdy but looks the skin looks very classy on my mac when looking from afar you probably would not notice that there is a case i purchased the gray color and a bonus that when opening the computer and using it the mac light still shows , great
fits perfectly on my macbook pro # w/retina early # snapped right in , hassle free the texture is this cool rubbery feel rubber feet on bottom have a great grip feeling confident this will protect my new laptop well also looks great in black got it with the keyboard cover - http / / www.amazon.com/gp/product/b # qt # <unk> that also fits perfectly
i love this case it snapped on easily and it fits like a glove it 's sturdy , but not clunky and obnoxious it 's the perfect price and extremely comparable to snap cases at twice the price do n't let the packaging fool you the color is the best , and the apple illuminates through it very happy with my purchase , and will probably purchase another one in the future in a different color
although it may be self <unk> , i kind of wish it came with instructions the case itself feels awesome i got the case in the frosted color and it still makes my apple standout and be protected at the same time it does n't feel slippery at all and now i have less <unk> when i hold my laptop with my sweaty hands do n't be afraid to push the case until you hear several tabs snapping in at first i thought my case did n't fit but you just have to play round with it a little bit would consider purchasing in the future with a different color
it took about # seconds to get it onto my mac i really like the color and the way it stands out the cover is a bit translucent so you can see the apple logo shining through when the mac is powered on
this cover snapped into place very easily and to date has not even <unk> at coming loose the rubbery surface has a nice non-slip and secure feel to it when you pick it up or just move it around it looks very nice and the apple logo shines through in an almost <unk> fashion on this black cover i am happy i have this cover as i have learned over the years that no matter how hard i try , i always end up with dings and scratches in & on my notebooks as time passes overall , the minute increase in notebook thickness is well worth the added protection i am getting and again , i love that it no longer feels slippery when i pick it up with dry hands
when i got my macbook pro i ordered a gmyle case for it , which did n't even fit and arrived with a scratch on it so i sent it back then ordered this case , which fit my # & # # ; macbook pro perfectly , good quality and worth the price
my wife showed me a hard case like this on <unk> it was a different brand that cost $ # i looked at this and suggested we give it a try she is very pleased it fits snugly on to her macbook pro # inch retina late # it has enough grip on the outside so it wo n't slip out of her hands the apple logo shines through brightly
got the royal blue one i get compliments wherever i went the color is absolutely brilliant and true to the color displayed in the photo the feel is great -- matte and rubbery , just as described the fit is <unk> as if they 're manufactured by apple themselves finger prints are easy to stick and hard to remove but i think it 's problematic on some colors but not others it does n't show up too much on royal blue -- only at a very particular angle of light
i gave this product a # star rating because it ended up being much better than i thought it was going to be i had a macbook pro with retina display and had a black speck case for it , but my macbook got stolen while i was at the gym : -lrb- so when i bought my new computer i was looking at maybe a good deal on a different case my speck case was just okay i did n't like the way it fit , and i thought that it actually may have scratched up my macbook -lrb- i was always to afraid to take it off because of this -rrb- this kuzy case is fantastic , it 's really great quality and fits my late # macbook pro perfectly the only thing that is odd about the case is what looks like ventilation on the bottom of the case , even though there are no vents on the actually computer itself either way get this case over the speck , you 'll save literally half , and get a product that 's double the quality
i wanted some protection for my new mbp because i know i 'm not going to be carrying it around a lot the case fits perfectly , the aqua color is beautiful -lrb- i like the & # # ; apple & # # ; logo glowing through the cover -rrb- & the material feels very nice i 'm glad i picked this case ; this is my # st kuzy product
love my kuzy case , bought a purple kuzy keyboard to go along with it and i could n't be happier . its a perfect fit for the macbook with retina display . will be buying again from
came when i expected it to in color i ordered seems to protect my mac as advertised only thing negative i have to say is one of the rubber feet came off and now it is a little lopsided when i put in on a surface lightweight and does n't make device bulky love the apple light when it shines through top
fits great on the # & # # ; macbook pro with retina display very smooth and silky touch apple shows through the cover , rubber feet on the bottom shipped next day for only # . #
i knew this case would not protect the laptop from a fall or <unk> , but hoped it would protect it from scrapes and scratches , and more importantly make it a bit easier to grip it does all that beautifully snug fit , easy access to connectors , and looks great
i like the rubberized feel to this hard case . the case fit nicely on my macbook pro and it was at a great price . shipped fast and pleasant to deal with .
so far , so good snaps on , stays on , looks good , keeps things clean , and i can still see the glowing apple logo if only kuzy made a case for my surface pro # & # i got the orange , and it looks great
took this on our honeymoon , before we left the top zipper broke in the airport the first day we used it on our honeymoon the top grip handle broke off the rest of the trip the shelves would collapse and all of our equipment would end up on the bottom of the back pack
the item i bought that is now shown is a different manufacturer although i like the case , stitching started coming out from one area & no one wants to honor the warranty digicom was the brand that it used to be - have called the manufacturer -lrb- digicom - the number the seller gave me -rrb- over a dozen times , do n't get any response have called since last <unk> . through feb # seller says manufacturer responsibility <unk> me on the seller for not <unk> up even amazon says & # # ; too bad , too late & # # ; after calling & doing what i was & # # ; supposed to do & # # ; to get satisfaction so be aware - you get this & have issues , you may be <unk> and stay away from digicom
i bought this bag for the size , design layout of pockets and <unk> , backpack to sling ability , and non-descript styling which will not tell everyone it is indeed a camera bag unfortunately , after my second trip with the bag one of the shoulder straps began to tear with an inch long tear across the top of the right shoulder strap this bag had a lot of promise , but the poor workmanship made this a bag i had to return returning the bag was n't an issue as i sent in a picture of the problem and got a return <unk> from the friendly and helpful staff i 'll be receiving a full refund in the end negative : poor workmanship and material positive : great design , space layout , many pockets , non-descript bag , and solid customer service this bag is better designed than many more expensive bags unfortunately , the poor workmanship and materials ruined an otherwise solid product
i chose this bag over lowepro since it has a good design and i wanted to save money i was wrong after couple of minutes of opening the bag from the package the zipper on the upper compartment malfunctioned and broke other thing that i noticed that the materials used for shoulder strap and the zippers are poor quality imagine having your # k of camera equipment getting damaged due to a broken zipper does not sound pleasant i have returned it and have ordered lowepro transit # yes it is $ # more expensive than this one , but i would rather spend more on my camera bag now than spending even more to replace my damaged camera equipment if the <unk> can improve the quality of chains , zipper and shoulder straps then this bag will be fantastic
this bag has all the right idea but i feel could use some <unk> the laptop pocket feels like an <unk> , it does n't my macbook pro when all lenses and camera bodies fill the other compartments zipper quality is low and the the waist strap webbing is entirely too long ; either causes issues when trying to put on the luggage handle or caught in my luggage wheels
this is a good bag for the price it does the job it was made for : quick access for the camera and lens , good storage for bits and bobs plus the lap top , ipad compartment you get what you pay for the zips are not the most robust out there and i think that with a lot of use they will wear very quickly all in all a good bag for the price
i have been using the pack for about a year now and it is starting to break down the interior seams are coming apart and the top handle has had to be <unk> on one side i like the multiple pockets and entry points to the back and it is comfortable to carry i am disappointed that it does n't hold up to regular use and wear
this bag was an upgrade from smaller case logic backpack that was too small for my camera and my growing amount of accessories the size and design of the bag feel right everything feels a little more secure the shoulder & waist straps are sturdy and adjustable i would give this bag # stars if there was more padding around the bottom where the camera sits that , and perhaps a few more <unk> on the outside also , i think this bag would benefit more from a single , thick shoulder cross sling in combination with the waist strap this would facilitate swinging around to the front , for access to the nifty side camera zipper flap otherwise that , i 'm very happy with the purchase and value for the price
overall , it 's not a top quality bag that being said , you ca n't pay that price for a top quality bag i bought it because i wanted a laptop sleeve , and my budget was below what the top brands offered for what i paid , it does exactly what i wanted it to do one thing i would change would be to add pockets on the side
i got this bag as a gift about # years ago and i like it a lot it fits my # d , t # i and my # lenses and a mic in the lower compartment i wish the bottom and the lid would have a little more padding , but its sufficient enough its comfortable to go hiking with but the shoulder straps are a little too big for my shoulder i 've read reviews of the seams coming apart or the zippers breaking . # years and nothing i 'm happy
i have used this backpack for a while but during the first three months , the zipper to the laptop part has split if i have too much weight in the camera section the backpack pulls away from the zipper and opens up ... other than that , i liked it
with the multiple cameras and all the accessories that go with them , this bag is perfect for all occasions the different compartments are a plus and being a backpack allows for hands free during photo shoots while keeping all belongings close at hand
very good bag when you consider the price of other camera bags tripod holder is a nice touch although the tripod moves around a little too much even when you have it `` <unk> `` up tight as you can all compartments can be configured to however you want i was able to fit # canon dslrs -lrb- # + # d -rrb- with # lenses , including a # mm prime with ease with room for <unk> filters , remote <unk> and most all of my other gear only gripe is the floppy tripod strap , can easily see a way to design the upper support better but that 's just my opinion good buy for sure
this product is great it has the necessary pockets for everything , laptop , camera , cellphone , ipod you can carry everything at the same time and is very discrete unless you carry a tripod it would be perfect if you could pick colors mine is black and green on the inside i would love it with a <unk> inside , also it came with a sewing defect on one of the sides -lrb- inside -rrb- , but nothing to die for that 's the reason why i did n't put the # stars
great bag for one <unk> camera with one or two lenses my sb # wont fit in the bag i have to remove my battery grip to make my camera fit in the bag i am giving # star because it is not bulky i just wish the camera side was a little bigger
i purchased this bag to replace a <unk> sling bag it easily holds my canon t # i with the battery grip , two lenses , flash and <unk> other accessories and you can easily access most of the compartments pretty easily it gives me alot of options seeing that i travel and hike alot it makes it easier to carry than just a sling bag it has plenty of room , and is easily carried a good overall purchase
the price was right and all my tablets , cameras , chargers , binoculars , laptop etc . fit perfect good quality construction great for traveling on the plane to substitute as the personal item for the # & # # ; laptop
the picture does n't do the bag justice it has more space in it than i actually needed at the time but as a beginner photographer who does n't own a lot of equipment , that gives me room to grow into it it 's good quality and worth every penny
i was looking for a backpack that would hold not only cameras and gear , but video cameras and accessories -lrb- i bike to work everyday with my equipment -rrb- first , the pack is sturdy and will stand up on its own its made of heavy material and quality zippers the pocket and pouch configuration worked very well for me and i am very happy that there is a large notebook/laptop pocket that i found useful the top pocket is about the size of a car battery so for me , it was enough to put other items -lrb- gloves , hats , or even my lunch ! this backpack has good support and straps but they do n't <unk> with too many or too large straps finally , it is padded throughout -lrb- the entire pack -rrb- so every pocket is a safe place for your camera , lens , gear , chargers , battery 's , and electronic devices
this was a gift for my husband who uses our canon t # i way more than i do he loves it and had it packed about # seconds after opening it on christmas
this bag has everything i needed for a backpack camera bag great quality , lots of padding the best part is you can access your camera from the side or front , there is plenty of other storage areas and you can wear it as a backpack or a sling very versatile !
purchased this camera bag for easy carry on a trip it worked out great it was lightweight , easy to use , and numerous compartments for <unk> belongings the rain cover worked great for sea world
well crafted and my friend really loves it he brought it back to his country during his december holiday and it was very good according to him managed to accommodate most of his lenses and
it has plenty of room for cameras , telephoto lenses and all the other stuff you have to carry i like that i can separate the used batteries from the charged ones if i carried it very far , using it like a backpack would be great usually my son or grandson carry it for me if they are with me i found that my laptop is a very tight squeeze even with the battery out but it will work which will eliminate the necessity of carrying two bags since i am a very senior citizen , that is very helpful
i think that this is one of the best back pack purchases i 've ever made at the price point its at i 've tested it by throwing it around a little with my camera in it and its completely safe i 'm excited to travel with it
you will love it plenty of space and pockets for all your camera gear the rain protector is a nice touch the canon # is a tight squeeze in this bag but it does fit laptop pocket is a nice touch very well designed and seems durable
we bought this to carry our canon t # i , additional lens , batteries , and associated equipment with us on our vacation to hawaii we found we were able to fit our little point and shoot and it 's equipment in this as well the waist strap came in very handy on a few long hikes through rain <unk> conditions , and up the side of a <unk> it was a great way to take all of our photo equipment with us on the trip of a lifetime
i searched and searched and finally i decided that i would buy this backpack i was looking for something that was durable , <unk> , and able to hold a large quantity of my equipment i am glad i bought this because it definitely gives you enough of space i love the fact that you can & # # ; customize & # # ; the inside velcro chamber to fit your needs there are some nice additional <unk> for all of your additional accessories a plus , i can nicely place my laptop in this backpack
this arrived and i started looking at it and wow , it 's great ! i can now pack my camera , lenses , tripod , laptop and accessories all in one easy to tote pack hands free to snap shots or do whatever it 's sturdy and well made too
great pack that keeps the lenses and everything else in its own compartment no worries about everything banging against other hard items this pack is the only way to go if you value your investment in your equipment
they are exactly the same as shown on the web cushions are strong enough for cameras & lenses stitches & zippers are strong , i 've used it for # months ans is still going strong it would be better if they have # or # more compartments on the upper part so that i can properly sort my stuffs it also comes with a rain protective jacket , good ! very quick delivery and i will recommend this item to my friends
this bag is great ... can hold all my lens , my laptop , and extra accessories and not be heavy or uncomfortable to carry the padding inside can be adjusted to fit individual needs and protect the contents well i am very glad that i purchased this bag and the price was excellent you wo n't regret ordering this bag
am not using this for my slr instead i have <unk> it to carry my lenses for my cell phone and also my cell phone that has a built in # x optical zoom built in the lower compartment is just right for my water tight , shock proof case that i keep lenses for my regular cell phone and also my watch repair kit fits into the same compartment perfectly either can be remove without any difficulties and the fit is just right the upper compartment has plenty of room for all of my other accessories that do n't need the protection of my had case the tripod holder on the side is perfect and the fit on the body is excellent without <unk> the chest strap the back straps remain perfectly on my <unk> the is an excellent product that i would not hesitate to buy again in fact i probably <unk> another for my slr to replace the one i have for it as this is a better quality and much better fitting backpack
given as a gift to an <unk> professional <unk> maker carries all his very valuable lenses comfortably and safely also carries a # `` laptop for all his editing needs said he was n't sure if he 'd use it for a single lens shoot , but does keep all his equipment neatly and safely in one place too early to tell about build quality , but seems good out of the wrapper
i now have a place to store all my camera equipment and extra room for lunch and things going on long hikes and things love taking pictures also have room for my laptop for the price and storage this is the best deal ever
a small edge of the cover reaches actually on to the desktop of the macbook with quite sharp edges if you have your palms on the laptop when you type , like i do , you will find this as disturbing as i did i compared this with the hard shell sold by apple , which turns out to be more recessed and will likely not have this problem one example where the cheaper version turns out to be a waste of money
case came with a lid to cover the top and a base to cover the bottom snapped right onto my macbook pro # . # retina -lrb- purchased february # -rrb- without any issues there are feet on the rear of the base which are kind of nice to have , but they feel cheap and flimsy like they might snap off if i 'm not careful i also do n't think this is the type of & # # ; case & # # ; you are looking for if you want protection from any kind of fall or drop i think all this case is good for is to prevent little dings , dust , and scratches which is fine , because that 's what i wanted the case also came with a keyboard cover -lrb- also orange to match the rest -rrb- which fits over my laptop keys well enough for function , but i would n't say it 's a perfect fit i give it # stars because i like the color , it fits my purposes and was a good price also , i did n't realize when i ordered it that it came with the keyboard cover , so i 'm glad now that i did n't order one separately
i bought the kuzy case and the ipearl and i much prefer the mcover ipearl case it seems to be made of a higher quality plastic and i love the clear transparent look the case has a great fit and the bottom feet provide a nice sturdy incline if you decide to use this feature -lrb- nice to have the screen more up to eye level -rrb- i do n't know if there is a new <unk> of the case but there are no tabs on the bottom part of the macbook which can dig into your wrists in fact the case does n't even go all the way up to the edge , which is a good thing as your wrists are touching the aluminum when resting on the computer rather than the plastic itself i threw away the keyboard cover and stylus as they are both cheesy add ons and not needed based on the case itself i think $ # is a fair price i ca n't imagine a situation in which this case would disappoint someone
this is probably one of the best computer case i have purchased in a long time extremely happy with a previous purchase for a dell xps # ultrabook so we bought one for this laptop high quality feel and not <unk> in any way it even has built-in stand to elevate the rear end of the laptop for heat to escape the bottom of the laptop
if you 're looking for cute , buy it the color is very nice , and the apple logo glows brightly through it while this case is capable of creating a cute , personalized computer , it offers very little protection for a $ # . # + investment the case is very thin and flimsy , and will only protect against scratches and scuffs it also does not snap onto the bottom back of the computer at all , nor does it cover the sides it did come with a lighter pink keyboard cover and a white stylus , which never made it out of the plastic that this case went right back into the case just is n't for me , and i ca n't even send it back because that will cost me almost half of what i paid for it i 'll stick to my speck case , which offers much more protection and piece of mind
i ordered this for my new # & # # ; macbook pro with retina display the case fits perfectly it is sturdy , form fitting and lightweight i ordered it in pink -lrb- mostly to deter my husband from using it ! -rrb- the case is translucent with a satiny finish , allowing the apple to glow through and you would be able to see a black decal if i chose to add one in the future the bottom section of the case has plenty of vents and two kickstand feet , which come in handy i also received a keyboard cover in pink -lrb- which i 'm currently not using -rrb- and a stylus this is a must buy if you want to protect your macbook and personalize it to your style
it 's only meant to keep the macbook from being scratched and that 's precisely what it 's doing i like the design , the little legs on the bottom that fold out and prop the computer up and the overall snug fit of the case it also has a good variety of colors to chose from it was a good value mine came with the case , a keyboard cover , and stylus , though i 'm not sure what i would use the stylus for on the computer good shipping time too
i had the speck case for my previous macbook and i honestly do not think that the difference in price between the two products can be <unk> this case was easy to put on and fits nicely this case protects my computer from scratches so i can just throw it in and out of my purse without fear
purchased this hard shell as a gift for my wife 's new macbook the case looks great , goes on easily and protects the top and bottom from scratches and scuffs the case does n't seem to add much weight and provides fold down legs for angling the keyboard look forward to getting one for my daughter
this case is exactly what i was looking for it looks great & it fits perfectly if protection is what youre looking for then this is night for you this is for style only it looks awesome but it is <unk> & is not meant for protection -lrb- from <unk> maybe -rrb- it comes <unk> a <unk> -lrb- awesome -rrb- and a stylus -lrb- which has no use for the macbook but i use it for my ipad and its perfect -rrb- i highly recommend this
this case is otherwise great , but the little rubber feet on the bottom keep falling off the first time it fell was after just one week of use , and i usually just put my laptop on my work table and do n't even move it around each time these rubber disks fell off i went into a panic trying to find the and glue them back on this final time one of them fell off and still has n't been found , so now i 'm typing on a wobbly computer it 's very frustrating and i can no longer return this case if you do buy this case , you need to be extra careful with these rubber disks and super glue them the first time they show signs of detachment
it is a transparent hard case -lrb- you can see the <unk> logo through -rrb- , aqua color just beautiful , light in weight , top portion secure but , bottom , a huge disappointment for me , this made it unusable because it would not stay on just wasted money the one that worked out for me was the : stm bags - grip macbook pro retina # absolutely not as attractive , heavy , and more expensive but since the purpose is to protect my new computer , the stm does it
a little bit plasticky but otherwise fits great , easy to put on and does the job i fear the little & # # ; feet & # # ; may fall off if used often but have n't had any problems yet good value for the price
