the string broke almost immediately if i 'd realized it was just for decoration i would have allowed it to dangle there does n't appear to be a method for exchanging it as a `` defective `` item or contacting the seller directly , so figured i 'd post this to warn others if you buy this <unk> and fun case for your airbook , just let the <unk> `` string `` dangle do n't expect it to be functional and appropriate for wrapping around the red tab
i wanted an affordable plain looking leather sleeve for the # . # macbook air i think this one was designed for the original air since the # . # version does n't fit perfectly in it but for the # . # there 's plenty of space if it were a an inch and a half narrower it will be perfect for the # . # air the stitching is very basic and for the price it 's quite nice i 'm planning to put it inside my messenger bag anyway so its perfect
- fits the early # macbook air # `` - provides some protection it 's thin and tight on the macbook which is good , but its not heavily padded by any means - i think of it more as protecting the macbook from scratches or being pushed around in a bag or something - there are cases with much more padding , this is more lightweight etc . - pleased with the product
cool and <unk> leather sleave let you <unk> store your macbook air when carrying it around very light and slim , perfect fit for the # inch macbook air with enough room for some papers and pens
what 's not to like it is real leather , the case does not add a huge amount of protection , but it keeps the weight and the bulk down and the price for leather was certainly acceptable other cases may offer more protection , but why would i buy a macbook air and then bulk it up with a huge cover when i need lots of protection , i put the air in the sleeve and put that in my briefcase the best of both worlds
i received this case as a christmas gift from my son he learned from his mom that i was getting a macbook air for christmas it is slightly too large for my # `` ` air , but it is no problem i am new to mac so i am taking the one to one classes offered by apple at every class the case draws a crowd everyone loves it i love that it is discreet and i can carry it without <unk> `` laptop case ! it looks like it may get dirty from use , but i think that will only serve to make it look more authentic most interoffice mail envelopes are always <unk> so far , i am very pleased with the case and glad that i received it
i bought it for my daughters # mac book it did not fit at all threw it in the trash would not recommend it at all only gave it one star because there was not any in the negative
used this for my daughter 's computer it snapped on easily and has stayed put the only issue is that the rubber feet came off pretty quickly , but that could be because they are very grippy , and she <unk> the computer around the rug overall , it does its job at a good price
great product , shipped in time with no cracks , and it fits i <unk> the key cover that comes with it as well i was especially happy that i bought it when my husband left a half eaten piece of <unk> on my keyboard this will save your laptop
i recently purchased my first used macbook and wanted to dress it up a bit being that the first gen macbook came out awhile ago , there are not too many options for cases so i was happy to find this one the case took a few minutes to eventually snap on , but was secure once it was on properly the color is a vibrant hot pink and material is a hard plastic with open areas on the back for ventilation it 's also light weight , so does n't add too much bulk to the computer the legs to prop up the back are a nice idea , but they seem a bit flimsy the only other issue is that the case limits the degree and angle you are able to pull the screen back overall , i am very happy with this case and it serves its purpose well to both style my macbook and also protect it note : this case is for the early generation macbook -lrb- a # -rrb-
i bought this for my step son who is attending college he is rough with his mac and i thought it would give him the cover he needed it fits nicely over his macbook pro the key pad cover is a little flimsy , but workable
bought this for my wife after she dropped her macbook that had a pink encase cover and broke the cover -lrb- thank goodness it was only the cover -rrb- i was n't able to find a new pink encase for her -lrb- the only way she keeps the cover on is if it 's pink -rrb- so i gave this one a try , and it has held up really well
i ordered the mcover hard shell case in pink for my macbook # . # `` the case is exactly what i was looking for and very easy to snap onto the machine love that the apple light shines through the case too ! the feet on the case were a bonus as well i did not realize when i purchased it that it had built in feet to angle the keyboard very nice feature
i just ripped the plastic off and snapped both sides onto my macbook it 's simple to do without viewing instructions the square that you see <unk> in the center of the photo is n't as noticeable at it appears to be i thought it would stand out , but you have to really look to see the lighter color square i 'm satisfied with the product , i 'll update my review after a couple months of having it :
i just got it and really like it so far i was really nervous about ordering this because , from what i have read , many similar cases impede the degree to which the computer opens or adds extra bulk and weight no problems with this case it fits well , is light , the finish keeps it looking clean , and it allows it to open just as far
this has worked great for my laptop for years it 's taken a bit of a beating because i have dropped it once or twice and it 's completely protected my macbook air i like the entire ipearl line and have bought a few other cases from them they fit perfectly and have a huge variety of colors
just got my case/cover today i love the way it <unk> my macbook fits perfectly ... almost too good , a little difficult to take off if the need arises the color is a great match from what i see on the computer & i love the legs in the back to prop up my mb for better ventilation recommended for macbook a # ! !
my gf wanted to make her macbook a <unk> to go and the ipearl does the job covers what you need , access to all the ports available the included kickstands work great on a desk to keep it cool i want to get another one in blue next
i bought the pink ipearl mcover for my sister 's macbook and she as much as i was satisfied with the purchase i had previously purchased a clear cover for my own aluminum macbook a while back and it has kept my macbook looking like new i definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a reliable and <unk> cover
this case is great it fits really snug and was easy to put on i also purchased the silicon keyboard cover in pink and now my computer is super cute it arrived at the specified time and in good condition very good buy
this is just too cute - it makes my old macbook look all cute and girly and hides the years of wear and tear quite nicely i would highly recommend
i bought this for my old roommate who is a close friend of mine who owns a mac she has a white one and always wanted a pink cover she did n't want to pay apples huge price tag though , neither did i and i always told her to get one online instead but she was worried it would not work so for christmas this year i got her this and she loves it it fits great on her computer , and looks very nice and crisp and professional just like the real thing she was so thankful for the gift and the colors look great against the white laptop i would recommend this product so anyone with a mac
i have now purchased # of these for our family and our macbook # `` models they are a must if you take your computer anywhere protect your investment - but it now
i love it but i wish the color was a little more hot pink the back legs work good , but barely use them because i do n't want them to break
i recently purchased the aqua ipearl cover for my # . # inch macbook the color was vibrant , everywhere i bring my macbook people ask me where i got my cover it was easy to put on the macbook , just a few snaps and i was ready to go it even came with a free keyboard protector which was a nice addition my favorite thing about the cover is that even though the color is bold , it is see through , so you can still see the apple glow the stand on the bottom of the computer is also a nice <unk> , its very helpful when you are trying to position your laptop on a hard surface i would definately purchase another one , its fun to know you can customize your mac this way
while this case does fit my vaio f series laptop , it is a loose fit except at the corners making it a bit tricky to zipper the padding is much thinner than the sleeve my wife has for her mac and it cost about the same
you get what you pay for it 's a thin case/sleeve meant for use with a backpack , etc , to protect it while it is in another case it wo n't protect much on its own cost is fair , quality good , nice to have a second bag for power supply i 'm happy with it just do n't think it 's great protection on it 's own
the product looks just like the picture soft texture , good for protecting it from scratchs if your looking for something to product your laptop from breaking when it falls this is n't case the adapter is good i keep my mouse and the power cord in the there
fits nicely , holds the power supply in own bag works great to then insert your protected laptop into a back back -lrb- primary reason purchased this -rrb- since made by sony fits the laptop exactly
i 've been looking for months in the stores but could not find a neoprene sleeve large enough for my sony vaio # . # `` <unk> # j sometimes i just want to carry the laptop around by itself without the added bulk of my laptop case it 's a beautiful laptop , and i do n't want to scratch it this sleeve fit my requirements perfectly not only is is branded on the sleeve itself `` vaio `` but also included was a matching neoprene ac adapter bag this was an added and welcome bonus i leave the laptop in the neoprene sleeve when i have it in my full-sized laptop case for added protection i highly recommend this product
this seller is not to be trusted i ordered a # `` macbook pro incase neoprene sleeve i was sent a sleeve that was too small and when i returned it and asked seller to send correct size , they did not respond i wasted my money and hope you do n't have the same experience i called multiple times and never received the proper size sleeve
be aware that if you order anything from this vendor there is a non <unk> # % restocking fee & no exchanges i mistakenly ordered this neoprene sleeve and asked to return or exchange it since i needed something with a shoulder strap the vendor refused to do any exchange & charged a # % restocking fee , even though the sleeve had never been taken out of the packaging this is just a neoprene sleeve what is a restocking fee about i wrote & asked for an exchange & they said that their policy is not flexible ... no exchanges & always a fee this is not an amazon customer friendly company ! i would not recommend ordering anything from them since there are so many more reasonable & reputable options out there amazon should review their <unk> with this seller !
this is the second protective sleeve that i purchased for my second mac laptop unfortunately this sleeve does n't fit my # `` macbook pro my computer does not fit inside nicely at all it is a really floppy , sloppy fit with about an extra inch of space inside it is difficult to carry around and i 've nearly dropped it because my computer shifts and slides around inside so much it fits so poorly that i began to think i purchased a # `` sleeve for my # `` notebook but after double checking both are # `` i expected it to fit like a glove - tight and sleek as the machine is itself
the case is extremely lose i have used a neoprene incase sleeve for my # & # # ; and it 's supposed to fit snug it just does n't i wished that the dimension for this product was posted
this is an older and <unk> product and is too large and baggy for the latest macbook pro # & # # ; please go to the apple store yourself to try the fit as of today , the <unk> & <unk> sleeve fits much better , but it 's much more expensive i would wait for incase to update the product i have a # & # # ; case for my old # mackbook pro and it fits perfectly but that was # years ago
a neoprene computer case is a pretty basic item there 's not much you can critique about a neoprene case , aside from how well it fits your computer in this regard the incase # `` fails <unk> in relation to the apple macbook pro , the computer which it is supposedly designed to fit the case is too large for the the # macbook pro there 's lots of extra material that bubbles up and sags its like trying to pick up a <unk> <unk> puppy up by the neck when i go to retrieve my macbook for airport security screening maybe it fits nice with a speck plastic hardshell , but its far too big without an external case a neoprene case should be at least a little bit snug , disappointing
with very light use the seam on the side popped open after only # month revealing the space between the lining and the neoprene outside which basically defeats the purpose of the water resistant sleeve poor quality manufacturing otherwise the case would be great itself
because this case is expensive it should fit the macbook pro perfectly it does not . it is too small for our silver macbook pro purchased in # . it may have fit older models , but we have to cram ours in also , there is no pocket for a charger , but i knew that when i bought it
i bought this when i purchased my # inch macbook pro in august # the case fit my laptop well , and it served the purpose of protecting my laptop while it was in my backpack the sleeve 's padding ensures safe travel , and the inside fabric is extremely soft although when i put my laptop in the sleeve , i had to make sure that the zipper did not scrape against the exterior of my laptop this minor inconvenience really did n't bother me now a year later after purchasing , the zipper has begun to come unstitched from the fabric on the corners -lrb- i 've submitted customer pictures <unk> the wear -rrb- the zipper has become very difficult to close and one of the two zippers fell off the sleeve i take my laptop to school # days a week and use it to write notes perhaps the multiple opening and closing was too much strain for this sleeve i have since looked for a new sleeve and was happy to find one that did not have a zipper : the ' # `` <unk> sleeve macbook pro blk by contour design '
even though it was the top hit for an incase neoprene sleeve it is from # , hence the # however , it was kind of misleading as it did n't say that anywhere in the description and it does not fit the new # -inch macbook pros
the case fits fine and is nice but one of the zipper handles would not stay on luckily the second handle stayed so i can at least use one zipper i like the case enough to keep it despite this flaw
i love this case the neoprene protects the macbook great , but there is one problem before i bought this case , i read some reviews on the apple site about this case leaving `` stains `` on the white macbooks as soon as mine arrived , i turned it inside out , and put it through the washer and dryer this worked great , and now i use this case all the time
there is a good inch of extra space at the top of this case and my laptop moved around a lot in it because it 's so big and flexible , it 's really slippery and would be easy to drop i had an incase sleeve for my air which has been great they 're both made of high quality materials , but do n't believe them when they tell you these cases fit the mbp with retina
great case , but it 's listed as a macbook pro case , but when i received the package , i was disappointed to find that it was the macbook air case i 'm returning it
well constructed , but fairly obviously intended to be a tight fit unfortunately , mine is n't . the width is just about right , but the height is about # `` too big this means that rather than being a smooth , tight fit , it is rather baggy looking maybe they started making them bigger because of the complaints about them being too small or maybe they have multiple manufacturers whatever , for the price , i am rather disappointed
first let me say this case is nice and i have no issues with it but at # dollars it 's twice as expensive as the same case on monoprice the exact same case minus the incase branding my guess is the chinese company that <unk> these brands them for specific companies , incase being one of them , and the mark up on these is ridiculous still , # dollars is cheaper than the $ # bucks you 'd have to spend at the apple store take my advice , shop for it over at monoprice and save yourself some money
the red orange colored incase is not red orange the picture and description of the color is not accurate it is more of a neon <unk> and more on the pink side
this sleeve is perfect in appearance and in use ... except for one small thing . when i first put my # . # . macbook into the sleeve i have to pull the zipper outwards while closing it until i get around the corners if i do n't the metal zipper scratches my macbook in a way i guess it is necessary to make the sleeve fit as tight as it does so it is n't that big of a deal but if they could solve that minor problem it would be a # star review for sure
the point of buying a sleeve was so that i would n't have to use a laptop case while i like the ability to choose custom colors and designs with the cases -lrb- you have more variety with cases than sleeves -rrb- , i do n't like how much bulkier the cases can make your laptop however , this laptop sleeve , though very nice in quality , is slightly too big for the ` naked ' macbook pro # & # # ; -lrb- aka the mb pro without a case -rrb- i would much prefer if the the sleeve was more fitted to the ` naked ' laptop on the plus side , i love how the sleeve was so much cheaper buying it off amazon than in computer accessory stores
this is the first laptop sleeve i 've ever had it fits nice and snuggly , and has just enough cushioning it is n't , of course , heavy duty or going to prevent your laptop from breaking if you run it over with your car in terms of carrying it around , though , it 's perfect
i really hate putting my laptop in my backpack & # # ; naked . & # # ; this sleeve provides enough protection for me to not worry about the little bumps that go along with every day life i recommend it to anyone that commutes with their laptop on a daily basis
the quality of the case is wonderful , but it does n't fit snug to my # & # # ; macbook pro w / retina if you 're looking for something that would protect your mbp if you dropped from # ft , this is not for you this , really , is only great for those that are looking to prevent your mbp from getting scratched i have had no issues with the zippers -lrb- no scratching whatsoever -rrb- and the vent holes at the bottom of the case are great for having to pack up quickly while your laptop is still warm
i like the product overall but i have to say that i do n't like how the outside feels it feels like <unk> and i ca n't stand the feeling of that material personally the product is great functionally and please understand that my above gripe is # % personal it 's like eating water <unk> , some people like the texture , some do n't do not let my personal complaint sway you from this product unless you dont like the way <unk> feels
i purchased this because i was given one for my # `` macbook when i recently upgraded to the # `` macbook pro i had to have another the new one , it is a bit more snug than i <unk> to squeeze into but the same quality and workmanship as my previous one it is airport tsa compliant , or friendly -lrb- is that possible ? -rrb- incase makes good stuff
it snugly fits my macbook pro # great quality and protects my macbook in the back pack the zip is separated out so that it can not scratch your laptop
i 've had several of these cases and love them i bought this one for my # & # # ; retina macbook pro and its about an inch too big for the computer obviously still works ... just not ideal must have been sized for an older model computer other than that its great
the incase # `` sleeve is a nifty little case to carry your precious macbook pro in it 's well made with sturdy thick zippers a fabric thats oddly soothing to the touch and is super thin i give it # stars because its what i knew it would be however , if i could make # changes i would add a small handle and a small hole where the power supply is so i could charge it while it was in the case even minus those features it is a great case and i now feel cool like all the other kids at starbucks on a monday morning
this fits my macbook pro # perfectly i was a little worried that when i put the case on it , that it would not fit , but it did my computer fit in nicely with my incase white frost hardshell cover and it feels so nice inside
bought it for my # `` unibody mbp , very glad with the purchase very well designed and fits my laptop very well my only concern would be that the zipper slightly scratches the sides when i put the laptop in sometimes , but other than that it is a great sleeve with both form and function
if you love your laptop and you move around a lot , this is a must have i have a hard shell on my macbook pro and it fits nice and snug in this neoprene sleeve
it might seem to the average consumer that this laptop sleeve is expensive , but you get what you pay for this item is very well made and stands the test of time i carry my macbook with me everywhere during the school year and the sleeve has protected it from scratches and small impacts the inside is lined with super soft material and the sleeve itself is made of a flexible yet dense <unk> great product worth every penny
works great for my # inch macbook pro the sleeve is very professional looking , provides great protection , and is slim enough to fit in a backpack could n't ask for more
this is the second incase neoprene sleeve i have purchased for my macbook pro the case is fabulous , its a snug fit , provides a protection of your macbook all the way around , lightweight it does not have a handle so if you need one i do not recommend this sleeve the greatest strength is the thickness of the neoprene you can slip this into another bag or suitcase and trust that your laptop is fully protected
this is an excellent sleeve for a # -inch macbook pro at a killer price the same sleeve was <unk> at a local store for $ # it fits the # -inch macbook pro perfectly and the outside is smooth enough to allow the sleeve with laptop inside to slide nicely into a larger bag
im so glad to have this sleeve to protect my macbook its prevents it from any scratches and keeps it looking new i highly recommend buying esp if you need to put your laptop in a back pack
this neoprene sleeve is ideal for my # & # # ; macbook pro nice , soft and protective however , i wish it came with a side picket for the cord , but i suppose thats what my backpack is for
i had a sea blue colored one before for almost # years now and it has served it 's purpose , but it got dirty so i thought why not get a new one now and i love it it 's black and simple it 's awesome i love incase items
i ordered this a day after i picked up my macbookpro i was thinking about buying this in the apple store for the regular price i decided to just buy the speck see thru hard cover i was a little skeptical if it would still fit with the hard cover it fit perfectly this is a great product for a reduction of the price
i just travelled internationally and carried my macbook pro with me the incase sleeve is really good in avoiding any sort of damages to the computer -lrb- scratches , very nice cushioning -rrb- plus , it 's very convenient when you go through security and you need to take your laptop fast the only change i 'd make is put a handle in case you do n't want to put it in your backpack
i spent considerable time searching for a sleeve to perfectly fit my # `` hp pavilion dv # i found the answer in this product , like the sleeve was made not only for # `` macs but also for hp pavilion dv # s it 's also made of high quality materials just perfect for my requirement
the case is just what i expected i bought something comparable to this for my sony laptop neoprene cases are wonderful <unk> incredibly soft , and do a wonderful job protecting your notebook from getting scratched up by other items in your book bag the size fits my # `` mac laptop perfectly not to mention , its looks very esthetic
i was unsure if i 'd be able to find a sleeve to fit my speck <unk> late- # macbook this one fits the bill it fits perfectly snug , and with no space for it to slide around in the sleeve the sleeve looks nice , and the plush liner will keep everything nice and smooth an added bonus is the relatively thick material of the sleeve it 's not cushioned necessarily , but it has a lot more give than the thin neoprene that i had to cover my old ibook
the item gets a # -star rating for it 's excellent quality and prompt delivery i use it for my # `` macbook pro , and this case does the job it offers good , quality protection this product would benefit anyone with a # `` macbook
it has a good material and great quality i had one of this for # year for my macbook pro # & # # ; and never had problems right now bought it for my macbook pro # and i love it
i would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a reliable , durable , and economical laptop case i had a case for my # `` macbook and was very pleased with it i am just as satisfied with the # `` case
i ordered this case a month ago , and i am very happy with it it seems durable enough to protect my macbook in most any situation i like the plush , white , inside liner , and the black neoprene outer layer which gives the computer a lot of padding and a cool look it would be awesome if the zipper were water proof because water can not <unk> neoprene but i guess water proof zippers are much more expensive and slightly cumbersome all around i really like the look , feel and quality of this product , especially for the price
every macbook owner should have one of these it 's the perfect protection from scratches , etc . i use it to carry my laptop inside my messenger bag and this keeps it in pristine condition
apart from the fact that i got it in the mail much quicker than i expected , the incase sleeve fits my # `` macbook perfectly , with no loose space inside i give it a lot of use , since i use my macbook for work , and in that sense , it is quite sturdy i am very , very pleased with it , and would reccomend it to anyone
i purchased this case for my mb pro # months ago it works excellent and also is tsa friendly you do not have to take your laptop out of this case when going through airport security i have been very please with this case and i highly recommend it to anyone seeking a case for their macbook pros
i have had this case # months now and i love it so much despite being carried to class day after day it looks like i 've hardly used it the inside is nice and soft so no worries about damaging the finish of the laptop or anything and its big enough that i can slide my ipad in as well i suggest when you first get it though to let it air in an open space as it can have a bad smell due to the nature of neoprene however , it goes away with a day or two of being aired out i suggest this to my
easy to get the pad in and out love it so much i bought another for my son the price was very reasonable , costs much more in stores
really high quality case pricey but worth it plush , fits macbook perfectly a tip : be sure to bend the zipper lining outward while removing and putting in case to assure against scratches -- it stays put and will not scratch if positioned in that way
the best , most simple sleeve i 've come across been using incase sleeves for about # years now and they stand up to <unk> with ease while keeping your macbook safe even through tsa lines
i recently purchased my incase sleeve for the new # `` macbook pro i already had a speck hard-shell case on my macbook , and the folks from the apple store told me that it would never fit in the incase sleeve they said it would be too tight , and it would n't even fit in the # `` sleeve i bought the # `` sleeve anyway , and it fits like a glove the zipper does n't scratch the case , and there is no excess room i am # % pleased with this case , it is so great to have anyone who is wondering about the speck case on their laptop , you should be fine
this case it exactly what i wanted it provides the protection that i need for my macbook pro laptop when i am traveling with it i would recommend this case
i bought this case for my macbook pro # `` it looks great and feels great , the only con is that if you get a hardshell on your macbook , it makes it a little harder to get it to go into the case ! otherwise , great case
i have had this thing for over a month and a half now and have seen no problems i used to have a # inch macbook pro and i had the # inch incase sleeve for it it worked great then , so i expected no less from this case when i got my l macbook pro retina buy it on amazon do n't buy from apple it 's like at least $ # at apple
incase is the best in laptop sleeves i refuse to buy any other the silky smooth case perfectly hugs my macbook and the cushion gives me comfort in knowing it is protected when i take it in my backpack
just as good as my previous incase neoprene sleeves for older mac laptops has a nice squishy exterior and feels very snug protects against bumps , scrapes , etc . not sure how well it would do with a drop or sharp impact , but it makes me feel safe <unk> the computer into my backpack
love the <unk> , padded sleeve that i purchased for my mac laptop it is great because it does n't take up much room and makes the laptop very portable while giving it good protection at the same time
i bought one of these when i bought my macbook in # it is black with a soft green interior six years later , i finally replaced it - with another incase sleeve , of course there are way more colors to choose from than when i bought mine originally i purchased the slate version , and i love it even more than the original for six years this case has protected my computer from everything , including a cat <unk> directly on it -lrb- the <unk> did n't reach my computer , and it washed out -rrb- i love it , and i have no problem paying $ # every # years for one of these
the sleeve is great super soft in the inside so it wont scratch your laptop , really thick for good protection , and it fits perfect with my mac book pro retina display
this is a great case for the macbook pro i love it it does n't scratch or anything at all the quality is amazing extremely durable and soft in the inside just remember this is meant to be a sleeve not a case with a place for the charger this is meant to carry only the mac that said i give this product # stars because its great at what it was meant to do . if you want to carry ur charger with the mac , just get the other <unk> bag its great too
this sleeve was the best thing i purchased for my mac . . it fits perfect even with my snap on case ! i would recommend this to anyone who wants a great sleeve to protect their
this is a very well made sleeve i feel quite safe putting my computer in it and carrying it around in my bag -lrb- which otherwise has no protection -rrb- my computer fits snugly , but not so much that it is difficult to take out or put in , just enough to not bounce around
i am very pleased with my purchase i have a macbook pro # & # # ; with a case and it fits perfectly into the sleeve when i first got my laptop i bought a cheap sleeve that was n't worth buying , but i was in a rush and it only lasted for a month i highly recommend this one , you wo n't regret it its a very good deal too , everywhere else is around $ #
timely delivery . product is good quality would have been nice if it had a <unk> for modem or cables it is a tight fit for my asus # nice padded material double zipper with holes for lock
this is possible the most convenient case for the eeepc # 's it allows you to use the netbook inside of the case and then just quickly close it and zip it up to completely protect the netbook i would greatly recommend this case to anyone this case does n't have a pocket on it so you cant take the power cable with you as easily but i almost always put it in my backpack so i can just put the cables in that bag the reason i did n't give this case a # star rating is because the case makes the netbook <unk> a little bit more heat than if it was n't in a case i do realize that there is n't much to do about it i do n't want to stop people from buying this case because it generates heat it does n't overheat the netbook it is just a noticeable amount i never worry about it over heating because the fans never turn up to cool it
i wanted an eva case to fit my # inch eee pc , but i could n't find any after looked a while for alternatives i found this memory foam case , and for -lsb- ... -rsb- bucks looked interesting i 've been using it for a month now , and this case do his job the eee pc fit perfectly it really look like a purse but i do n't care , i carry it inside my back pack one advise try not to use your eee pc inside the case for long periods of time , the computer gets pretty hot
awesome product for the money it protects my asus netbook -lrb- # inch screen -rrb- really well and i generally do n't even take it out of the case while in use i will most likely purchase another case with pockets for longer travel , but for short trips , this definitely does the trick
