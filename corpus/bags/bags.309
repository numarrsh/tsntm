exactly what i expected when i ordered it while the keyboard cover does feel weird when typing , it only takes a while to get used to it i really love the soft sleeve which was what i was originally looking for
i really love this its the perfect hard case and protective cover i with there was a handle to carry it but i can deal with that the keyboard cover fits with a little extra it makes it a little hard to type with if your typing a lot . but it is very nice and well worth the money
i received this a week ago and it has been great the color is really pretty , a little lighter than the picture i thought the keyboard cover looked kind of weird -lrb- being all solid color -rrb- in the picture but it fits really well in person the case fits really nicely on my macbook overall a great case hopefully it 'll still be like this in a few months
topcase has given my old macbook pro new life and style the case was easy to snap on and the turquoise keypad has given my laptop pizazz the screen protector was a little tricky to apply , but i love the added protection i love this product
case fits perfectly on the # inch macbook pro retina display love the color and the keyboard thing is pretty cool too the soft sleeve bag is n't the best but it works with the other pieces too the screen protector was very easy to put on and is n't even noticeable now the case is see through so you can see the apple and i have a vinyl decal that you can see too
arrived earlier than <unk> case fits perfect i like the rubber stoppers on the bottom a lot better than foam on other models screen protector is really cool uses static to stick to the screen not sticky ca n't go wrong here
the shipping was super fast and i could n't believe i had it in my possession within three days after i placed the order the color is just like the picture , great quality and not hard to <unk> to laptop i 'll definitely buy from this seller again thank you for fast delivery and great quality merchandise
i really love this case purple is my favorite color and it looks even better on my new macbook pro easy to install and just a few quick snaps and the sleeve is an extra bonus to the package
this case fit my mac perfectly i am very happy with my purchase i bought the black case , and it 's a matte finish and it covers the laptop exactly very happy with the price and item arrived as described
the case is very attractive in addition to being protective of the laptop the only issue is that the keyboard cover sticks sometimes with some of the keys if you have long documents to produce , you may have to remove it to keep your typing speed and accuracy
i am very happy with this purchase it was n't expensive and adds a very pretty layer of protection for my macbook pro i have the # in with retina display and it fit perfectly the sleeve does have a strong smell but i 'm sure it will fade i would definitely buy again
excellent price and quality product all items work flawlessly with my mbp a # and i put these items on while <unk> my mbp have n't removed them since the case fits great snug fit and protective sleeve the silicone keyboard cover fits perfect and responds great i did not use the screen protector but it lines up perfect with the screen great package to have
case snaps on easily leaving access to all ports keyboard cover fits the keys well and was easy to get used to the screen protector fit nicely w / minimal bubbles -lrb- i 'm not all that good at putting the screen guards on in the first place -rrb- i would recommend this product
i got this briefcase last fall i was impressed with the overall look and feel however , in an effort to make it seem more substantial , they place some kind of brittle cheap plastic in between the outer leather and the inner liner all of this plastic liner has since cracked and <unk> and can now be found bunched up in between the inner and outer leather pretty much junk for a very expensive leather bag
it 's pretty darn big , and it was just more than i needed , but it was a fine bag all the buckling and <unk> would get old after a while , i suspect good quality leather , though
the bag has some scratches on it and the leather was not polished at all i have to get a leather polish it i only like the fact it is an original
i agree with others regarding the quality and positive features of this bag however , you can not wear this bag over your shoulder due to extra long strap and poor location of the shoulder strap without having it hang below your hip -lrb- i 'm # feet tall -rrb- the backpack configuration for the strap is better , but i do n't like to wear the bag as a backpack that often finally , the three strap buckle system is not quick release , so you have to undo the straps one by one if you want to open and close the bag which is not very efficient overall , i love the look , size and quality of the bag , but the strap and buckle systems could use some improvement
i 've been using this for work for some time now , and i am very happy with the quality , size and build it easily fits everything i need and more after reading the reviews i was afraid it would be heavy , but i did not <unk> it any heavier than my other bags and backpacks the only issue i have with it is the buckles they do n't seem to be of the same quality as the rest of the bag , and fastening them can be a hassle if you do n't have a table to place the bag on not a big issue unless you need to open and close it frequently all in all i would recommend this bag
feels like it will last i did not like the # piece # foot long arm strap so i like someone else on here took it to a shoe repair place and had them make it a one piece strap i also like someone else on here cut off the # different rings hanging all over the place , i 'll never use it as a backpack either i have tossed it around for # weeks , i 'm curious to see how it will look in a month , # months and a year
it is a very sturdy bag and , so far , it has held up to the rigors of use also , it appears in this case that price does <unk> to quality
i wish they had an option for # stars <unk> is <unk> the best seller i have ever dealt with courteous , always gotten back to me within an hour , just a stand up guy the product was amazing , the quality of leather , exactly as described it 's strong , <unk> , and will last forever , and at a very <unk> price you have impressed me <unk> , please keep up the good work , thanks . & # # ; anyone looking for the best quality and service , order from these people ... ... . . thanks
great quality and outstanding value as attractive as it is sturdy very well designed and constructed the extra long strap is <unk> problem actually with a little imagination , the strap provides <unk> configurations than pictured finally a briefcase that can hold a full day 's work and more
this bag is absolutly beautiful the loops were a bit tight when i first got it . but i just kept working the lines thru the loops and now they go in quite easily all of the extra rings i find very handy for <unk> on my keys or work badge the pockets on the inside are just the right size to hold my wallet in one and a book in the other i use this bag every day sometimes it gets heavy because i put my purchases in them instead of holding another bag when shopping . but the strap is more then sturdy enough to take the weight the sholder strap can be adjusted easily i am # ' # & # # ; and find that the strap is just right for me to carry on one sholder and i can lengthen it if i want to cross it over my body my bag was not oily but i did buy some leather cleaner to keep it clean and i also bought some conditioner to keep my bag looking as beautiful as i can
in the end , this bag was everything i had hoped it would be beautiful in person , roomy with adequate pockets and compartments and a nicely finished interior and yes , as expected , this thing is heavy - it 's made of beefy leather and has a lot of hardware as others have noted , the leather oils can initially rub off on your clothing right out of the box , but after using some leather conditioner on the bag , i have n't had any more issues i expect this bag to last a long , long time
the size is everything that i hoped for the laptop is secured in a lined pouch and there are plenty of places to stash what i need to carry with me
looks great and very comfortable it has just a bit more space than a thin messenger bag , but not much great for travel because it will slip easily under any airline seat and it looks damn cool it 's darker than it appears in the image
<unk> many complements i have purchased several other packs and they all seem to tear this one is durable and looks clean only caution , it does not fit standard size laptops it does hold a compact laptop , power cord , folders , supplies , etc with no problem wish it has a bottle holder on the outside
it is good quality , the colors are bright , overall a good purchase wherever i am , i get compliments it was $ # cheaper through amazon apple is way overpriced
this laptop case is to die for i 've only had mine on my macbook pro for just a few hours and it looks stunning and is really well made i ca n't wait to hit campus after the summer break to show it off the only downside is that it does add a little bulk , but i 'd rather have fabulous looking protection than nothing at all
it was extremely fast shipping i saw the case in the apple store but was n't ready to pay a ton for it but i 'm more than happy with the quality makes my macbook look super chic
the laptop case provides a nice pop of color to any macbook wanted to write a little review about baseline since they provided great customer service i had emailed about exchanging a product and baseline was extremely accommodating and not only responded quickly to my <unk> but was also extremely understanding and worked with me to help resolve the issue so many times people tend to write to complain about poor customer services , but really wanted to <unk> baseline , especially <unk> who i had emailed with several times
i was nervous about getting this online but it fits perfectly and it looks great ... no more scratches on my laptop the bonus is that its much cheaper than getting it in the apple store $ # vs. $
i saw this case on the apple website and fell in love with it , but i did n't feel like spending $ # for it i found it here and was a little hesitant about ordering it i 'm so glad i did it fits my macbook pro # & # # ; perfectly it 's a hard case with a kind of rubber feel to it i 've gotten so many compliments on it every time i pull out my macbook
i bought this in hopes it would have a lot of storage it does that , and i do like the <unk> of the product what i did n't like is that it 's just too big for me i 'm not a very big person , and i just look silly carrying this bag if you 're not worried about the size of the bag itself , it is a good product it is made well and has plenty of storage
it 's very hard to find a decent bag for a larger laptop that 's not the size of a suitcase i was very pleasantly surprised when i got this bag delivered it has padding and plenty of pockets for my needs i do n't carry my laptop out too much , but when i do , i need a bag and this one will work great the shoulder strap is substantial and the print is cute in person seems well made and does n't look cheap for the price i paid , which was a nice bonus ca n't wait to see how long it will last
love it because it 's stylish and fits my # `` laptop at a fraction of the price of other bags i have found wish it had a little more padding but overall i really like it
bag ripped after only a few uses macbook pro fits in easily with additional space for a note pad and a few files . front zip pocket holds ac adaptor , although a little snug
the <unk> eco # -inch laptop carrying case is a really tight fit for my dell lattitude # `` laptop the outside pocket wo n't carry the power supply or a full sized mouse it will carry a few cds or dvds and maybe some sd cards , that 's all there is very little padding , so do n't expect your laptop to be protected from anything except for rain the outside skin seems to be water resistant , but probably not waterproof the carry handles and shoulder strap seem sturdy
i was initially worried that this would n't have enough padding to keep me from worrying about my laptop there is plenty of padding my only complaint is that the fabric scratches pretty easily and leaves marks since i only use this as a sleeve , it 's not really a big concern
i wanted a laptop bag with a handle i needed something that was n't too bulky to put in another bag the color and material are just what i wanted and there is a pocket to put small items
so i bought this , and it was $ # , so i 'm not out a great amount of money it fits my # & # # ; laptop fine , but the power adapter does not fit into it for crap i had hoped that at # & # # ; it could get shoved in on the side also the zipper 's messed up , i can get it to close from one side , but not the other the side pockets are useful , but again the material allows for no expansion , when the dimension says # & # # ; by something by # & # # ; deep , they mean it i ca n't fault them for that , but it 's still quite limiting i ended up purchasing a different messenger bag locally , and the day -lrb- today -rrb- that i discovered my laptop fits in it , i came online to return this one because i 'll never use it now alas i missed the cut off by # day i 'll find someone to give it to
it is a great narrow briefcase ... made of canvas i would have expected it to have more reinforcement to protect a laptop if you put a laptop in it ... there is no <unk> to protect the laptop from damage , yet it is sold as a laptop bag i expect some <unk> in a laptop bag to protect the laptop if the bag slips out of your hand color is great ... comfortable handle
i love the bag it is made up of a material that does not attract animal fur , which in my house is a big problem it fit my # inch dell computer perfectly plus it has a side pouch for the cord and the wireless mouse it is light weight and easy to users well i love the color as well a deep purple almost like an eggplant the only minus is i wish it had a little more padding to protect my laptop
decent laptop bag , great for larger laptop , however not much padding if you are hard on your laptop this bag is n't for you , but if you just use to go to & from school or work , this is sufficient
cheapest options i could find for a widescreen laptop bag at local stores were in the $ # range found this and i 'm very happy for it it is not overly padded , so you still need to take care ; but it snugly holds the laptop and the side pocket easily holds mouse , power cord and a notebook my only criticism is a nitpick the hooks for the shoulder strap are on opposing sides of the main opening and therefore it can be a little awkward to put the laptop in the bag i 'm sure there 's a good reason for the placement -lrb- stability , center of gravity , etc . . . -rrb- but it 's mildly annoying but , for the price , i 'll deal with it
it is of good quality material and zipper is easy with no snag . the color is great and it fits my wife 's new # . # hp <unk> a perfect fit a great high quality product at a great price and fast shipping
i paid for this cute carrying bag last month and it has already fell apart it comes undone at the seams by the zipper and it is happening all the way around i would not buy from this company what a joke ! !
i was very surprised to see that the color blue looked very faded the handles and zipper are one color blue and the bag itself is much lighter -lrb- as though faded and old nice bag , but wish it came in more colors the mint green might have had same problem , and i did n't choose black , but wish i had chosen the black i am kind of embarrassed to walk around with this faded look
the bag seems good it really protect your laptop but my bag had its internal computer lock ripped i had used the bag only for one and a half month and the bag ripped i got disappointed i hope other costumers have more luck than me
there are two sets of straps inside to hold the laptop in place and they both broke within a month of using it so i had to saw them back together they have n't come apart since the silver piping is wearing off but other than that it does the job and i got many compliments on it initially , i thought the black strap did n't go well with it and wished for a pink one , but then i realized it would 've gotten dirty with all the daily handling i 'd definitely buy it again though i wish they had it in more colors , not just pink and lime a nice french blue would be great
great case , but one of the pins that holds the handle on the actual product was broken when i pulled it out of the box took a super long time to receive and it was for a birthday , so did n't have time to return it overall , good product
fits my asus <unk> well enough that there is very little extra space , though i can fit the charger and a notebook i love the chrome <unk> letting it air out before i use it for <unk> case is n't precisely a & # # ; hard & # # ; case it is a firm , but very flexible material i was hoping for more protection against dropping items there are some great cases out there that are super solid
i like this a lot , i can get so much into it i find it easier to carry with shoulder strap , hard plastic handle starts to <unk> hand after too long perfect size for my samsung chrome
it 's sturdy , compact and water resistant the black strap gives the look an edge , as well as provides secure fit holds small notebook and accessories it 's perfect for light travel my student loves it
this is a great bag for me , i like that i can pack my laptop and other items i need its nice to have everything you need to work with at arms reach
not only does this bag hold everything for my chromebook , but t is actually cute and fashionable i get nothing but compliments on this the product arrived in sealed packaging - no problems with the order and it was an excellent price , too
you get what you pay for this thing is so ugly in person , the leather is super orange and the felt has a weird purple tint to it it would make a good sleeve if it was n't so ugly
maybe for the price it might be worth it to some people i have bought better sleeves for around same price range the biggest issue i had with this sleeve was that the magnet that close the flop needs to be a lot stronger does not hold the flop shut
the product in and of itself looks nice and like the material it 's made of however , when i received it , and tried my macbook pro # . # in it , i was not able to close it as the magnetic lock buttons were way off could n't even stretch them to make them work
the case is cute and soft but i do not think it was actually designed for a # inch macbook pro because it does not fit my laptop the laptop slides in fine and is completely enclosed in the case but when i try to close the flap , two parts of the magnetic closure do n't reach each other to align i tried using some force but even if i manage to close it -lrb- rarely -rrb- it just pops back open as soon as i put it down pretty disappointing because now i can not really use the case for the purpose i bought it <unk> looks way too <unk> and <unk> to keep my laptop in as i go between meetings
it took a while to arrive , but that 's understandable since it ships from overseas the craftsmanship is impeccable , but the felt material around the button feels like it will stretch out easily i 'm using this sleeve sparingly in fear that it will wear out other than that , it looks great
keeps my habit of dropping my bag from destroying my macbook air works great in the airport , and gives my laptop a nice clean feeling every time i slide it in
not as high quality as i expected the sides are n't as well sewn and sometimes the flap is kinda <unk> so it closes at the middle but not at the sides otherwise , those are my only <unk> still works and looks fine . :
this case is awesome i get compliments on it all the time it keeps my macbook air nice and cozy the only thing i might want to change in the future is the magnet that closes the flap my macbook air fell out because it was n't strong enough to keep the flap closed i just have to be a little more careful , but a new latch may be a good idea for this case
seller provides great customer service as an fyi - the cover is n't very thick to be honest , i was expecting something of higher quality based on other reviews i was a bit disappointed but it fits the new # & # # ; macbookair perfectly that being said , i 'm using it and like it fun to carry around and it looks professional
i have the # & # # ; macbook pro retina , this is great for it there is a little extra room in the case when my computer is in it , but nothing that bothers me so chic and elegant looking
this case fits my # & # # ; macbook pro -lrb- with cd drive -rrb- perfectly and looks great too even a little extra room to fit my <unk> planner if i want too i 've gotten a lot of complements on it
i hardly ever rate products , if ever with that being said , i am really enjoying the value of this case for the price it 's great , it looks great too i ca n't comment on the durability because i 've barely had it a week but so far so good
the case fits really snug and very business like look if you have a hard case on a macbook pro , the only difficulties that you may experience is getting he case to fasten with the case on your laptop other than that , i 'd definitely purchase from this seller again delivery came faster than expected too
i bought this case for my fiance 's asus laptop and it fits like a glove the materials used to make this case are high quality and the magnetic button is a nice feature i 'd recommend this case to anyone
i really like the style and it fits particular well for my macbook pro i ca n't really complain about the long duration of the delivery since it 's from overseas i use it mostly everyday , for it shall be a case nonetheless for my macbook it served the purpose for a protection once i travel to class in the harsh <unk> environment
i bought it for the envy x # it 's a <unk> bigger than i expected bag is not exactly same size this means that at the end you have more empty room than needed would be nice if the bag was a little smaller just to feet exactly the envy x
this bag is advertized for # inch laptops and there are several product <unk> labelled for various laptop makes while they all have the same exterior and interior dimensions to start off , the material of the bag looks very sturdy , and a laptop along shall fit into the main compartment all right there are , however , a couple of points that make it not suited for my travel use the zipper of the larger side compartment is too short to let an ipad # in , even though the compartment itself is sized to accommodate one the zipper <unk> are rather big they are perfectly fine on the main compartment , zipping around the edges but , on the larger side compartment , it pushes the adjacent folds far apart , making it less <unk> i <unk> the slimness of the laptop charger and there is not enough space for it in the main compartment
my hp envy x # fits great i wanted to put my envy in the bag and then into my bag , however this case is a little big i can still use it , it has great padding all around so the notebook will be secure
very nice and functional accessory bag the <unk> <unk> made it sleek and less space consuming the shoulder strap made it that much easier to move around without worrying about dropping it -lrb- in which case the padding will come in handy -rrb-
i am a very efficient traveler this was purchased for an hp envy x # i love that i can the laptop , cell phone , cords , id , and the basics i would in a purse without needing anything else it does n't feel bulky and is perfect for traveling i do n't like to carry # bags when i can have just one and this is perfect
my wife was looking for a carrying case for her hp duo tablet this was better than expected . the shoulder strap makes it fits small laptop , tablet or kindles with room for accessories in the # exterior pockets not my color but it is her favorite color
i have used this for around # months , it works really well is very <unk> and nice pockets i stuff my charger in here and i still like it great high quality worth the $
i hit a home run when i purchased this bag it fits my hp envy x # perfectly and has room for a mobile mouse in a small front zippered pocket and a kindle in the second larger front zippered pocket there 's another pocket in the back for other & # # ; stuff & # # ; the shoulder strap is a bonus while traveling i slide the bag inside a backpack and easily <unk> the laptop when going through airport security i shopped around but it seemed like many of the offerings did n't quite fit the longer shape of the envy x # this one was a little more than i originally intended to pay , but it was well worth it besides it 's utility , the quality of the build should make it last well beyond the expected life of the envy x # if you own or are thinking about buying an envy x # , do n't look any further for an excellent bag to go with it
we have a hp envy # it fits perfect the color is a bit off but the material is going to be great it has a purple cast that is not true <unk>
looks cheap and fake , especially the shoulder strap the shoulder strap is made from a nylon fabric , is very thin and is a completely different color from the bag sent it back
i bought this and paid more for bag because i thought it would fit my # inch macbook air the # inch fits my # in macbook air and # . # inch way bigger and bulky then advertised
this thing is cheap plastic poorly made i had wrongly assumed from the original price that it was a medium quality product the plastic is thin and reeks of chemical residue the front fasteners are weak magnets the whole product looks like something from the dollar store i may give it to my three year old <unk> to let her play dress up or carry her picture books in , after the chemical reek wears off
the only reason i put one start jut for the rating otherwise i would give it zero just do n't <unk> your money unless if it 's for $ # . # max $ # : # keep away from it pay more get better quality
i was super excited to get this bag i received that bag and was super disappointed it looks cheap and was quite small i am a teacher and need a little more room than the bag afforded
make sure you look at the pictures the strap is not leather it is some sort of cheap material like a cheap guitar strap or a belt you get for free with jeans from <unk> . it 's also pretty girly looking once you get up close and personal with it i returned it immediately but i think some people might appreciate it more than i did
in general , the bag is great i really like the color and quality for the price however , i got it for my # inch macbook pro -lrb- as it is advertised to fit -rrb- and it is too small i wish it was a half inch bigger
i 'm not one to be much bothered by the smell of products , but this one has a very strong , toxic smell it 's bad it may go away eventually , but what will i be inhaling in the & # # ; airing & # # ; process the construction of the bag is cheap the snaps closing the bag are only where the buttons are visually , leaving these odd hanging pieces that i know will eventually tear off because they 're completely useless and supposedly cosmetic the strap on the bag is so cheap looking and cheap in terms of quality -- it 's just a nylon strap with no visual relation to the bag other than it 's brown the pockets on the outside of the bag -lrb- but inside the closure flap -rrb- are handy , but large and not very tight , so things would definitely easily fall out of them i was highly disappointed in this bag i 'm a <unk> and i do n't buy leather , so i 'm used to faux leather , but this bag material is the cheapest i 've seen you can have much better quality faux leather than this and not have it look like yucky vinyl
its not real leather but appearance wise its good i 've taken it to a conference and its pretty professional but cost wise its very costly and i have seen many good deals on thanksgiving which can get you a leather bag with the same price
it needs more padding and the lining of the bag looks soooo cheap , it would look better if it was just black on the inside . if i had the chance i would n't buy again
it will work ; however , be prepared to be let down i would definitely recommend buying another product : the case smells <unk> of cheap fabric and the strap is not well-made at all if i paid $ # , i would be a great deal happier it does have decent storage compartments , hence the # rating
this is a good useful bag it 's just what i needed in size & shape # -rrb- appearance is <unk> i do n't expect it to wear well # -rrb- strap is too light & needs shoulder
the product was fine its a little hard on the shoulder after carrying for a while . there is not as much room <unk> was hoping to have for school and work its a great product over all
the bag is nice looking , more compact and classy than most computer bags however , for the price i paid , i would think i would have been able to buy a real leather case somewhere although nice , it is overpriced
i am not super happy with the & # # ; look & # # ; of the material , but my daughter loves the bag , and i did purchase it for her , so ... i guess if she likes it , i 'm happy
i purchased this bag as a combination ipad case and briefcase it 's very nice and i gave it four stars because the material is a little cheap looking the styling is very nice though , it 's sturdy and keeps its shape lots of space
it 's a okay bag the color may differ from your computer screen bought it for my brother and he liked it and was not a big messenger bag great for putting in your kindle and other items you can see the picture that amazon put up showing note pads and looks like a tablet want a small messenger this is the one the strap is okay i would had prefer a bit thicker and at least a padding on the strap so its a bit more comfortable
definitely not the highest quality material in the world , but it works perfectly for bringing my ipad to and from class , along with a binder or small book not the purchase you should make if you have to lug around heavy textbooks or multiple binders , but for my purposes it is perfect
i was afraid it looked like a purse , but as long as you wear it as a satchel it wo n't look very feminine in my opinion but has worked perfect for what i needed it for , which was a slim and simple bag for my macbook pro # inch
the bag is great bag , but it has no pockets for pencils pens they go all over the place and are hard to find in the bag so get an extra pouch or a different bag the material s beautiful and totally worth it
