the product was good for the price not as high of quality as i expected and for some reason the picture makes it look like it 's supposed to be canvas
i receive so many compliments on the cover design it 's so unique and interesting but , the size is not perfect for a # `` macbook pro there 's an extra half inch of space around and i can feel my laptop shake around inside also , the inside is padded with some kind of thin foam which is probably adequate for protection but just does n't feel like it provides enough cushion also the metal zipper pulls have a plasticky grip attached which looks tacky and makes the overall design look far cheaper this is probably not a case i want to keep for a long time so the price is perfect if you just want a temporary , yet stylish , case for your laptop
my # & # # ; macbook fits in it , but i think i 'll look for something else as i 've found another use for this good for a & # # ; project & # # ; case for keeping papers / forms / records together until a project is completed it stretches and holds a nice stack of stuff i say it 's strange because i 'm not sure what <unk> the newsprint is in , but suspect it might just be made up or a combination of several
ok amount of padding in the case warning : it is not exactly like the picture it has a <unk> <unk> on it and the writing in is not in english it was kind of disappointing but i 'm fine with it it will be good for what i 'm using it for
the case does a great job protecting my laptop , i have a macbook pro that fits perfectly inside and i take it with me to almost all of my classes but the design is misleading , the other side is more empty and has a color picture i bought this product because it 's black/white and the newspaper style , the back is nothing like the front
everything about it is great , it 's very cute and i love it it fits perfectly but the zipper gets stuck quite often and it takes a bit of force to get it unstuck
promptly delivered in time for christmas -lrb- thanks again , amazon -rrb- product is of decent quality and generally as described so i ca n't really complain it does n't provide much protection , but no one should buy this type of product thinking it will protect your laptop from falls just know that yes , it will accommodate your # & # # ; macbook , but it fits up to # & # # ; laptops as a result , your # & # # ; laptop does n't fit snugly but hey , they told me
this case is a little large for my # `` macbook , but it provides a nice amount of wiggle room , rather than it feeling like too much the wording on the outside is a mix of real words and nonsense words , so it 's not actual news articles , but provides the neat effect of seeming like it i like this case a lot
so i was hoping for the english one , but i got the french -lrb- ? -rrb- one instead not a problem , i just got it for the news paper design it 's a nice little case , seems to do the job lightly padded , fits my dell # & # # ; ultra book just fine
the sleeve protects <unk> against water and scratches , but it will not protect it if dropped it could also probably use a handle , but other than that i love it
however , i am glad that this sleeve does fit my mac & # # ; # , and i also have a protective <unk> on the computer itself it fits in the sleeve just fine so i 'm really happy about that
the case is great the design is really unique and the quality is better than i expected the only downside is that there is n't a lot of padding and the inside is n't soft , but i 'm ridiculously happy with it still
i like it it was cheap and works fine the design looks cool -lrb- it was a little bit different from the picture though . the only problem is the zipper is n't great quality so im assuming that its not gon na last for years but still good for this
fits my # & # # ; mac book pro perfectly great protection - i took this in my backpack commuting from the <unk> to downtown for # months and had zero problems , even in heavy rain
the laptop sleeve is very pretty and i get a lot of compliments on it i have a # `` macbook and it fits perfectly it has n't ripped or anything for me but i 'm not very active with my laptop , it usually stays on my home desk or work
i love the design of this case i like to think of it as though no one will steal my computer that 's in it because at first sight , it looks like newspaper the quality is good , and i believe it to serve its purpose well while at the same time it acts as a conversation piece i would recommend this product to those who are not looking for designer cases , but who are instead looking for an economical and good quality , stylish item
i have a # inch macbook pro and it fits just fine inside of this case as far as shipping , it came much earlier than projected and much earlier than i expected , i ordered it on a thursday and received it by tuesday , packaged well and in great shape the design on mine is different and actually has a small color picture on each side -lrb- blue and yellow and black and white -rrb- like a photo in a newspaper it says `` fashion `` in huge letters which i love because i happen to love fashion it looks a bit different from the picture but it 's pretty much the same thing it looks nice , it 's sturdy and padded and it fits my macbook pro it 's great to carry around and fits in my jansport backpack that i carry to school i love it i 'm glad i bought it
this case it simple , and a great quality piece the zipper is sturdy , the lettering is nice but not exactly like the pictures it is more of a brown color , an there are color images on one side of the case the articles are not <unk> , but that does n't bother me at all the inside has nice padding , and i feel secure that it will protect my # ' macbook pro sufficiently , which fits perfectly inside of it
great desing and fits like a glove it even protected my laptop from a small spill that <unk> when i had groceries in the back trunk of my car i definatly recommend this
its definitely not going to fit any extra inside , but i knew that from previous reviews i almost bought this a a much higher level one day it was around $ # ! so i jumped on it was eyeing it for a few months it could only be <unk> if it did have a extra pouch for the power cord at least . <unk> your looking for a unique bag , this is it
this laptop case looks so cool and fits my # . # `` macbook pro perfectly i did n't want a hard case for it because i do n't carry it around that much , but this offers the perfect amount of protection if you are n't going to be carrying it different places everyday
i love my new case it fits perfectly if you are looking for something stylish the only issue is that there is not a lot of padding to keep your laptop safe but its perfect to carry around in a bag to keep your laptop from getting scratched
i like the product because it is exactly how it was described it fits my computer and its very unique ! havent seen anyone else with it has good padding and not too bulky . it can easily fit in my backpack for school , it is very
i bought this item around christmas after i got the macbook pro # `` for christmas it 's served its purpose well i do wish that it had a tiny bit more room for the charger to go with it but other than that it 's been great
i ordered this for my ipad # it was a real <unk> the actual cover looks cheap the quality of the print is very poor it looks good in the photograph but not in reality it is also too big for the ipad #
this should not be advertised as an ipad case it is way to big , does not fit snug and secure it is perfect for a small netbook sized computer , but please do not say it is good for an ipad
i was incredibly disappointed in this product and feel misled by the seller i bought it for my ipad # which swims around inside it with room to <unk> the design is exactly as pictured and described , but saying this is for the ipad is like saying a # `` samsonite suitcase is also for the ipad simply because it will fit inside so i could be as descriptive as possible and help potential buyers better understand the actual size of this case , i did a little <unk> with an assortment of items on my desk the case simultaneously holds my ipad , my kindle in thick lighted case , my iphone , my blackberry and a # `` thick # `` x # `` spiral notebook without even stretching to close the zipper i will be attempting to return this product since the advertised description was deceptive
i should have read the description of this item <unk> thoroughly it does not have an outside pocket which i wanted for storage of charger the quality of the sleeve is not as sturdy and strong as i had expected
actually list all the os 's this mouse works with on the mouse mac is not one of them it cuts out all the time and is really slow once it turns itself off you have to slap it to get to <unk> up this is the a waste of money
this mouse doesnt work the red light on the bottom would come on , so i knew it was on and had charged batteries , ect , but the <unk> would never move on the screen , it was so <unk> i gave up after two days and returned it
it keeps turning off <unk> i started by turning the on/off switch on and off ... then i figured i was tired to bang it on my pad to get it to work and just plugged in my old mouse again not worth the bother i marked this as a one star item , but it shows as a # star ... figure
it works but if you are expecting good quality mouse , you might as well spend the same amount of money and go to <unk> <unk> or <unk> to get one
this mouse is junk do n't buy it every time i went to use my computer i had to reset the mouse by unplugging the little usb plug one fall off the table and the entire thing broke
very cheap plastic construction - but even cheaper innards takes two aaa batteries which are n't included borrow these from someone rather than buying them - because ... the mouse lasted from # to # , a bit over four hours , then died permanently it 'd cost me more to return it than i could get in a refund , so i may as well have burned the -lrb- thankfully ! -rrb- few dollars i spent on it read the other reviews i did , but bought it anyway ` cuz it was cheap and red do n't duplicate my mistake
i made the mistake of not reading the reviews of the mouse prior to purchasing it dumb me , because now i am out the money i spent -lrb- i realize it is not expensive , but it still <unk> i own a macbook pro , and it does not work it has only worked for about an hour when i walked away from my computer , i could not get it to work again i 'm back to the drawing board for a red , wireless mouse . : - -lrb- do not buy if you own an apple computer
it was a cute little mouse , but alas , the cuteness ended when it <unk> stopped responding on any mac -lrb- i tried several different ones -rrb- oddly enough , it still worked on a friend 's pc mac users beware
when i unpacked this it looked cheap , but i figured hey for # bucks what can i expect i used it for # week every time i closed my laptop and <unk> it the mouse would not be connected i would have to flip the switch and take out the <unk> and put it back in for it to sometimes work again on day # it did n't work at all and i returned it to amazon i am now back to my belkin mini mouse for now do not buy this , it lives up to its price i wish i would have read the reviews before purchasing this
i do n't think they make a more <unk> mouse this is horrible the movements are choppy it just quits moving on the screen i finally threw it away do n't buy it
i ordered this product twice the first item never showed , so amazon sent out another one the second one arrived dead on arrival might as well pay the extra $ # and get a brand name mouse with a lot more features
this mouse was great for about a month with my windows pc , and then it stopped working it always booted up and had a pretty good range it just stopped working it was a very nifty mouse , but i am going to invest in a better quality one next time
i did n't have any issues with they way it worked it was a good mouse however , they do n't last very long i 've went through # in a year in a half
for the price it 's a cute mouse -lrb- i 've got a red theme happening with my new macbook pro -rrb- the drawback however is that once it goes into sleep mode it will not <unk> by pressing either of the buttons as it should you must remove and <unk> the usb element from other comments i 've seen on the web however it works fine for pc machines
i chose this rating because i bought two optical wireless usb mouse for macbook one worked very well the black one the other -lrb- red -rrb- was defective and only worked about a week i did not return because given the price , etc . the hassle was not worth it so basically i am rating the purchase for two and only got # % or what i expected
it 's lightweight and feels pretty cheap but it has worked decently well thus far there were a couple times i could n't get it to respond and it seems to have trouble connecting to my mac on occasion but for the price it 's adequate
its a fair product , its the least of what i expected it to be but good , i love the unique shape and i must say its help me just the same as any other mouse
this mouse worked for a couple of weeks and then just stopped responding , i ultimately had to throw it away it was cheap and a great price , very thin and ergonomic design but not very sturdy
cool looking mouse , it works fine for me the price is also good the battery life is very long for a mouse the quality is n't the best , feels plasticky and somewhat flimsy
i have a red computer theme going on here lately , and this sealed the deal it is sleek , shiny , elegant , and i have received a lot of compliments it really does look like a $ # mouse that you 'd buy at an apple store fyi : the usb part is inside the mouse where they batteries go , so do n't be <unk> also , while this mouse fits my hand perfectly , it is a small mouse , so it 's not for everyone my boyfriend actually has an alternate wireless mouse that he uses instead of this one oh , and by the way , the four stars is for the clicking : the clicking is really , obnoxiously loud well , at least compared to the logitech wireless mouse i have if you want a super lightweight , shiny , sleek mouse , then this is a steal for $ #
this works great with our mac mini , it small and can be hidden well , love the fact that we have one less cord to wrap around or hide i would recommend this for purchase :
i use this with my asus eee pad transformer with a self powered # port micro hub i run the mouse and a micro keyboard makes a fantastic system and works quite well the usb dongle is keep inside the battery compartment of the mouse the mouse some times freezes when it comes out of sleep but found out pressing the switch on the top <unk> it up not a bad little mouse it is <unk> not a logitech but neither is the price i like it ! ! ! may get another for my micro laptop netbook as well
i got this mouse because i though it looked cool some people complain that the wireless dongle is hard to find because it is stored inside the battery compartment , but i liked it i thought that it was very helpful when travelling the only downside is that the plastic seems kind of cheap and for some reason , the right click button is bent down much farther than the left and looks odd
i thought it would way a little heavier than i expected or at at least than it is now but i guess i have to get used to it looks kinda cheap on the bottom though , but other than that its pretty decent the shipping was fast too
i love this mouse it works very well with every operating system i 've tried it with so far -lrb- including windows # and # , mac os x mountain <unk> , and <unk> -rrb- it 's a very `` flat `` design , so if you 're coming from a bulkier mouse you just need a few minutes to <unk> to the change scroll wheel and buttons work exactly as one would expect that being said , it feels very cheap the mouse weighs practically nothing because there is n't anything in it removing the battery compartment is a bit of a chore for that reason i 'm giving it a # star review instead of # -lrb- though if it continues to work as well as it does , i 'd probably up that rating a bit -rrb- plus you ca n't beat that price
i ordered this mouse a few months ago , did n't have high hopes for it it turned out to be quite good , i use it as my main mouse at the office it looks nice , still works and does n't <unk> a lot of batteries -lrb- still have n't replaced them and i use it daily -rrb- it also has a place to store the usb dongle in the battery compartment so that you do n't lose it would recommend it for this price
i like that this mouse is flat and fast the cosmos optical mouse looked similar to one i forgot to order on a ` deal ' so i <unk> it it is the best mouse i 've owned do n't be afraid to buy one because you never heard of the name - two friends have used mine and want one for themselves oh , and it 's working perfectly on this sony vaio and i saved $ # . # by giving the cosmos a try fits nicely in my laptop carryall
bought this for a friend who has a new red laptop and she loves it now she does n't have to use the pad on the laptop and she is happy thanks
yes , it looks a little flimsy but the price is right i do n't know if i would use these everyday at the office but for the computers i have running # with only occasional <unk> , these work just fine i think it would work just fine for moderate use no problems with accuracy or stability actually , a very attractive and sleek looking unit
i paid less than $ # for a wireless computer mouse ; my demands were low it works great just plug in its usb and go it feels <unk> lightweight , but who cares i do n't care if i drop it during travel or somebody <unk> it , so it 's optimal i certainly recommend this for a mouse on the go using windows # on a samsung
looks cheap and awful ... <unk> it away , could not keep it for storage , as i got very upset when i received that <unk> if you are older than # <unk> , please , do not
cute bag , poor quality ! bag tore up within two weeks of my # yr old daughter using it this also happened to her <unk> whom ordered the same bag , different color i am returning it
after # months the strap broke - at the d ring , and also the pocket lining is falling apart this is super cheaply made , and not worth it , unless you want to buy another case in # months
i previously wrote a really positive review , but i completely changed my mind i really liked this product , but it broke after less than a week i had barely used it & the zipper broke at first it just jammed them it completely broke so it wo n't even zip anymore i 'm very disappointed that i had to throw it away & it 's brand new
this case is really pretty , has a bright color and looks well but it will not last more than a few months , mine got broke after # month , i do n't really recommend it , use this money to buy something better
i ordered this case to use with my new macbook pro -lrb- # inch -rrb- and i was trying to find a slim case that could hold my laptop along with the charger and my ipad it definitely does that , but unfortunately , i can not get past the smell this case smells like it 's been <unk> in gasoline , and wrapped in cheap plastic not to mention , the velcro strap on the inside was unraveled when i got the case i 'm sending this thing back - i can not take the smell anymore i think i 'll spend a few more bucks and get a case that i actually , and wo n't give me a massive headache due to it 's foul smell
i like the color , which is the main reason i bought it but i was happy to find it was n't in the last bit flimsy it 's a bit smaller than i expected my laptop 's at the top end of the range admittedly but i was expecting it to have more slack and i <unk> to really jam it in there something a bit roomier would have been nice , and if i had more peripherals than just a mouse , a power supply , and an ethernet cable i could n't really use it
love this bag , it has so many pockets for all my items related to my laptop the inside color is a little dull , but i like the quilted black exterior
my e # s thinkpad # `` fits into the bag along with two notebooks and cables it is a neat bag i like it how i can fit more than my laptop it 's good for my lightweight laptop i would recommend it
it is exactly what it looks like my laptop fits in there just fine & i have some extra room for other papers , the charger & some cables as well i have n't put the bag through any tests like rain and such , but just for regular use , it does it 's job
love this bag just enough room for computer and some papers pocket on the outside great for phone , charger , etc . fabric is easily wiped if you get something on it
love the bag i have a # inch laptop - it fits nicely there is room to spare , but it has a little velcro thing to keep it snug it was pretty stinky but the smell went away in a few days it looks like the picture but it is a little brighter
i have a new notebook computer and needed a carrying case for when i travel what # st attracted me to this case was it 's color pink is my favorite color and i had to have this case when i received it i found i could put my notebook computer , it 's cord , wireless mouse , my kindle fire and small digital camera all in this case perfect for me
i bought this back pack for my # th grader , hoping it would last at least # years not so ! ! after a few months the fabric at the bottom and corners started to wear and tear i put my trust on nike name and it did not <unk> this packpack was not cheap compared to what i saw in stores
the only thing i 've found negative with the backpack is that you can not remove the fabric from the rolling base which makes it hard to clean it i am using it for college every day and it has held up great owned it about # months
i just love this purchase and the color is super nice i am a college nursing student and this is indeed very useful with all the heavy books and laptop that i carry along i 'm sooo loving it ! !
love it ! love it ! love it i always thought those rolling bag packs were so geeky but , once my back was hurting me too much from all the books , i decided to get one and try it out i have to regrets i picked a nice one , too its soo spacious , yet light when , i pack it with my school books , i can roll it , or when i only have a couple of things in there , i can use it as a regular bag pack
i <unk> after this super cute case for a long time , and waited even longer for it to come into stock unfortunately , i recieved it june # st and in less than # weeks the seams up by the flap , on both sides , started unraveling it 's been steadily falling apart ever since keep in mind that i rarely use my laptop for such minimal use , i 'm very disappointed do n't sacrifice quality for visual appeal i will be buying one with a zipper closure next time
i ordered this product for my # . # `` lenovo b # laptop i really like the colors and designs , and the case is easy to reverse but it does n't quite fit my laptop right there is a little bit of excess space on the sides which makes the whole case bubble i did n't notice in the photos available but the case has an open flap design , so if your laptop is too small you ca n't adjust the flap at all i would definitely recommend checking the dimensions of your laptop before purchasing this product
i ordered this for my # & # # ; macbook pro and it was really big i should have measured my computer first the pattern is great -lrb- i was n't crazy about the pattern on the inside -rrb-
i have a # . # inch lab top , and this case fits it pretty well it 's a little lose , but i do n't really mind that it is reversible but i prefer the pink side i really like the case but i would n't trust it if you were just stuffing your lap top into a suitcase or something of that nature it 's perfect to stick in my back pack though
got it today in the mail it 's really pretty , colors are vibrant and good quality , but when i tried it on my laptop -lrb- hp pavilion m # dx -rrb- it 's a little bit loose all around i would love it if it 's an inch smaller all around and thicker material most items sold here on amazon -lrb- cases , decals , bags -rrb- are n't up to date yet with the slim laptops that have come out recently i 'm saying this coz if i had a regular sized , bulky # inch laptop it would definitely have fit with the machine 's thickness but the past couple of months , ultrabooks and slim -lrb- lightweight -rrb- laptops are about an inch or two thinner than their <unk> , so it would n't fit the nice cases they have on here i 'm holding on to this for the next few days and will upload some pics , but i 'm not sure if i 'll keep it . =
the pattern is nice the material has good amount of stretch for easy insertion the reverse pattern is great too which was a plus when the other side got dirty it 's been over a year and no damages yet a good buy
i was so excited when i got the sleeve -lrb- <unk> surprise -rrb- in the mail when i opened the package , it was very eye catching , vibrant colors the shipping was pretty fast too it fit my # . # in hp notebook very well its stretchy material , so even if your notebook is a tad bit bigger , im sure it will still stretch to fit i am giving it # stars because it would have been so much better if it had a velcro latch , but it does not i got the impression that it did im still satisfied with my purchase
i was glad that there was extra space in it , but some people would want this to be more snug it fits my # . # & # # ; macbook pro with its hardshell cover , charger , and ipad with its case , and my usb wireless mouse . and its really cute :
this case fits my # `` macbook pro perfectly and goes with my computer tote nicely i bought mine at wal-mart , but the one here is cheaper it 's easier and faster to load than the <unk> second skin that i used before
this item was exactly what i was looking for my laptop fits perfectly and even better i have just enough space to add my power cord this is perfect for me as someone who travels frequently for work
i bought this wallet bag to replace one that i bought about nine years ago that i loved it was made with a different fabric that was a little stiffer this bag now is very flimsy i have to take it off my shoulder and set it somewhere to take something out of it and it 's very inconvenient when you 're in line at the grocery store or when you 're in a hurry i do n't think it 's worth the money i think i paid over $ # for it it 's way over priced
bought this to carry kindle fire hd on plane around my waist worked good <unk> i did n't have to check it and could fit in a snack and billfold and meds color was ok i had wanted navy since that was the color i was wearing and wanted item to blend in with clothes
i love my baggallini i use it all the time and stay completely organized with a place for everything and everything in its place my keys have their spot , my phone is easily accessible but safe with the magnetic lock and everything else has its slot on the interior the brown color goes with everything
i was really disappointed in this back pack i bought it for my # year old son i looks like a back pack for a # year old it is tiny i do n't think it will fit his laptop if it does it will be a very tight fit
the backpack material feels flimsy , but it is big enough to carry the essentials -lrb- ac adapter , mouse and some paperwork -rrb- the padding is just adequate but for light duty purpose and the price , it is good enough
bought this as a gift for my grandson , he uses it but it is somewhat hard for him to get his laptop into the back pack , it really is more suited for a # inch
this is a very good product , i feel like it will last for a while it has enough room for my laptop and a folder and small notebook the only major drawback is that my computer is exactly # . # inches , and i have to pull the back of the backpack over it to get it fully inside other than that its great
i got the icon <unk> # for my laptop it was a decent price and it is a good basic backpack , it does what i need it to and not much else the material is rather sturdy , i 've had it for a couple months now and i use it often and it can withstand my use which i like all in all , good deal
this backpack fits my # . # `` laptop fine it 's snug , but does n't require anything special to be done simply put the laptop in the back of the bag , put my charger in the bag as well and go recommend , especially for the price
for what i paid for this backpack i expected the worse , but it 's actually the only backpack i use i purchase along with a targus backpack and i use my icon more often this backpack is excellent material , can carry a decent amount of items for its size , and is a great price
the case looks nice the color is perfect for me i also like the matte finish but after about # month i started to notice that the edges of the case are chipping the corners are cracked which i feel is an indicator that the quality of the case is not great it is also almost impossible to pry off the case once you get it on i feel like i am going to break my mac as i am forced to <unk> this case off
i like this color , it 's pretty purple and special but the most important thing is it does n't fit my macbook now ! i just used for few days and it just <unk> so i going to find the other case ... also , i have n't received the others items yet , i hope they are great
the case is top notch , no doubt about it , but it does n't fit the # tb hard drives , believe me <unk> , and there 's no space for the usb cable had to buy another case , so
the latch broke off when i opened the case to put the hard drive in for the very first time now i am unable to close the case i am very disappointed in this product
this product is damaged even without falling the latch that was suppose to close the case got broken and fell off . it is so weak if all the other claims about this product is true than this is something they should improve
