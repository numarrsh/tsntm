it is a quality product , but a little small for dell # it just fits it but <unk> to the extreme for the height i wish it could be # inch taller and # inch thicker
exactly what i expected the reason i rated it a # instead of a # is that its sometimes tough to use the zippers also the first time i used it ... got scratches really easy overall it 's a nice bag and just what i needed
great notebook bag for the daily commuter or student fantastic assortment of pockets , but do n't expect to fit much more than your laptop and a school book or two in the main compartment i was slightly disappointed , as i bought this bag to serve as a carry-on for a trip overseas i could n't even fit a sweatshirt in the large compartment i gave it four stars because it held up great , very well built , with no blatant design flaws and it fits a surprising amount of small gadgets to accompany your notebook
i just received my backpack today and am impressed with the quality for the price -lrb- $ # -rrb- i have a # `` dell inspiron it fits but barely the velcro `` <unk> `` is stretched to the max with my laptop in the compartment but it does close i like the little storage area included in the same compartment where the laptop goes for storing my mouse and tablet pen there is also an area to store my wacom tablet the front storage area is great for all those other little things like power cords , business cards , pens , etc . overall a great deal
i pretty much love this pack , which i 've owned for over a year i just have two <unk> the first and the biggest one is that both zippers have crapped out for some reason the zippers catch on the fabric that attaches them to the bag and wear a hole into the fabric making in a hassle to zip the pack because they catch every time the second issue is that when loaded with a laptop there 's only room for about # or # notebooks or two textbooks tops for the most part i 'm pretty happy with it and when i 've tried using other packs i end up coming back to this one
this is a great deal great bag , backpack for travel with # inch laptop looks good too only payed # bucks after <unk> up for an amazon credit card i love amazon
the whole reason i got this bag was because i 'd just purchased a dell xps m # - which is huge the laptop and power adapter fit into the back -lrb- just ! -rrb- and the bag is comfy and seems to be well put together it was a good buy
the bag fits all the qualities that i needed in a new laptop bag all accessories and gadgets fit snug in place the bag does not add any extra strain on the back due to the padded arm straps i keep a # `` laptop and a <unk> ps # in my bag with no problem great for the price highly recommened ! !
i purchased this backpack for my hp dv # laptop and it works perfect i was concerned about finding a backpack to fit the # `` laptop and this one is great i also have plenty of room for the cables and other items i want to take along with me i would recommend this to anyone
very comfortable on my shoulders just what i need to bring my # -inch dell inspiron notebook to and from school the pockets in front come in handy for small head phones , web cam , flash drives , a digital camera and many other random items i can even fit a large book in the back pocket where my computer is i 'd recommend this product to anyone that is tired of carrying their laptop/notebook in a brief case type of bag hurting one shoulder distributing the weight has saved me the pain and has helped free up my <unk> to carry other things
i 'm very pleased with the lowepro backpack my hp # fits perfectly , with plenty of room for the <unk> , cords , mouse , etc . laptop is easily accessible for removal at airport i tried a messenger bag , but wrestling with the flap at security check was a pain the backpack style leaves your hands free and the flat bottom allows it to stand on its own somewhat heavy , but that 's mostly my fault for choosing a # `` laptop i agree with the reviewer that said that it had a storm trooper appearance it 's durable and the function wins over form on this one
this is an excellent product , i was able to carry my laptop , camcorder and digital camera with all the accessories with no problem this is a very durable item
the briefcase might look okay , but it 's even too small for your laptop with a plastic cover over it i 'll sell it in a garage sale ... to get rid of it
worse case i have ever seen all the corners were chipped and after <unk> combination , per the instructions , i could not unlock the case sad to <unk> had to destroy the case to get my stuff out do not buy this case you get what you pay for
i was looking for something to handle my day to day activities and be able to hold my macbook , but i did not want to spend a fortune i took a chance and am glad i did it has been in use since december and is holding up great there is plenty of room for folders , papers , pens , flash drives , notebooks and my laptop it looks sleek and professional looking i would highly recommend this briefcase update - this clip broke after a month
i just recently got this for my dell laptop and as the previous review mentioned this was a great choice at a great price other aluminum briefcases are on average $ # more this briefcase comes with a easy to put on strap and take off strap for running through the airport the briefcase comes with a easy to move divider to give the laptop the room it needs and creates room on the other side for the mouse and power cord i throw two spare batteries in the pouch and i 'm off i can highly recommend this to others who have a # inch screen and lower
i agree with all the pros for this bag in the previous comments this is an awesome bag , but it is too heavy and bulky even when this bag is completely empty , it probably weighs about # lbs i like this bag so much that despite its weight , i kept it for a semester of medical <unk> holds everything unfortunately , i have to sell it because it is too heavy
i picked out this backpack as a gift for my husband based on the positive reviews here he likes it a lot and uses it every day when he goes to grad school there are a lot of compartments so it 's great for organizing your things i agree with the other user reviews about the handle on top - it does add unnecessary weight to the bag overall it 's a nice , cool-looking , sturdy bag
well this backpack has so many pouches that you would never run out of space the material is very nice and looks and feels durable the problem is that this backpack is short in lenght i am not very tall and when i use the chest strap it can go above my chest and near my neck if a tall guy uses that strap he would <unk> this backpack is great , but in my opinion it is not good for tall people
this backpack very effectively stores a laptop and books , etc . i have tried other laptop backpacks and this one is the best the straps are extremely comfortable and it has great cushioning the design is excellent i recommend it to anyone who regularly needs to carry a laptop with them
my son has a swiss gear backpack already and loves it he wanted this one in particular because it has a laptop pocket i know by the quality of his current swiss gear backpack that he will have it and use it for his entire time in hs and it will stand the test of time
this is a great backpack , it has a lot of storage and compartments , well thought out and designed for business and school usage excellent construction and it will stand up right when placed on a flat surface i would highly recommend this backpack to others the computer pocket protects your computer with foam in the bottom and raised above the floor , good shoulder straps and cross strap which helps keep the back on when having to run the outer pocket is designed to strap a jacket to the pack the only issue i have had is one of the zippers is a bit difficult to pull closed due to the seam material catching in the track
backpack is very good quality , has great storage space and is very comfortable the zipper seems to have ` bent ' and , while it works , it catches at that point and has to be ` forced ' to open or close
this is the second backpack i actually purchased the first one was also by swiss gear . their products are great ! the bags have very little flaws if any at all they are sturdy and have a lot of room you can fit almost all your accessories , plus textbooks and binders i like the combination of colors on this one quite a lot i am not sure if this one is water resistant or not as it was mentioned on someone 's review in any case at the price it is sold i think it is worth every penny ! ! i will only buy swiss gear backpacks from now on , i am hooked for life !
i originally bought one of these backpacks my second semester of sophomore year of college at this point i had already been through # or # backpacks and wanted something that could handle my brick of a laptop and the outrageously heavy books i was forced to carry to class i tend to be very hard on products like this and i used it almost everyday for # years including traveling nearly # years later , i am just getting a new one when this backpack finally failed it was n't the stitching ripping out and the backpack simply falling apart as with my previous back but instead the failure of a zipper that finally led me to buy a new one if i had really wanted to i could have probably gotten the zipper fixed , but i decided to finally retire my old backpack mostly because i wanted a blue one ! the only complaint i can ever say that i had about this product was that its feature to always stand upright was quickly lost with mine
please note that the maxxum swiss gear blue is actually different form the red version i purchased a blue one to replace the red one , only to find that the computer pocket is designed to be tighter so that the blue one does not fit my # `` laptop the red version , with the link below , will fit the # `` otherwise the products are identical . http / / www.amazon.com/gp/product/b # <unk> #
good : solid construction , plenty of pockets for accessories worked great as a carry on with room for a change of clothes bad : chest strap located too high for me needs to be
the bag is really nice compare to the other laptop bags available in the market i really like the pockets which it has . the shipping was fast as well and the bag arrived safe and sound
this backpack is great it is my # rd time purchasing it the # st was for a friend the second my dog ended up eating and this one is working great i can hold all of my college books as well as my computer and whatever else i need to carry for that day this is a great bag for a good buy
this is a very nice laptop backpack as an fyi for those looking to purchase , i have a # `` widescreen dell <unk> # l and it * just * fits into the laptop pocket , any bigger and it would n't zip up i do n't fault the bag for that at all though , as long as the computer fits with all of my textbooks to boot its just fine the straps are very comfortable and cushioned , i have n't had any problems carrying it so far a good buy for anyone needing a way to carry both computer and books in one package
bought this as a gift for my son he has commented numerous times how happy he is with this bag it fits his hp laptop perfectly and has plenty of space for his college books and papers
i bought this as a replacement for the same backpack i 've had for years -lrb- + # years -rrb- and loved many pockets and plenty of space when traveling they made some minor changes from my old bag but the same basic features are all still there this bag wears well and i was glad they did n't stop making this model
great backpack , computer is suspended in a pocket in the middle of the pack , not against your back but it is too small for my # . # `` laptop be sure to try before you buy
this backpack is great theres so much room & so many different compartments to help me stay organized i 'm a law student & have to lug around a ton of heavy textbooks i 've had to carry a backpack stuffed with books , a tote bag for the rest of my books , & i still had to carry my laptop separately but believe it or not , everything fits in this backpack my only complaint was that it buckles over your chest & if you do n't wan na buckle it the straps just hang there & are annoying but this was easily <unk> - i just cut the straps off & you would n't know they were ever there now this backpack is perfect , i 'm actually looking forward to carrying all my books in it to school i definitely recommend it for students or anybody that has alot to carry & keep organized
very good quality , lots of pockets to stash things like a mobile office holds the # inch laptop just fine use it for business travel and it fits under the seat on the airplane
my daughter has used a similar swiss gear backpack for years this one has more features and the water bottle net pockets are deeper we love it well worth the money
first of all , this bag does not age by this , i mean that i 've had this bag for -lrb- approximately -rrb- # years now , and i 'm not know to be very gentle or nice to my backpacks this bag , however , still looks basically the same as the first day i started to use it not only that , but the pockets are cavernous and just what i need for my <unk> , and the laptop pocket is absolutely perfect it fits my computer securely , and i do not worry about it at all when tugging it around for the day if there were more than # stars , i would give this bag just that
this bag is great and fits soooooo many things i have a lenovo t # , a # . # in laptop , and fits the bag nicely i 'm not sure why people are complaining that it does n't fit tight but works well the chest strap , as other people have mentioned , does get a little annoying but not enough for me to cut it off there are pockets with in pockets and hidden compartments all over the bag if you 're a college student , this bag should easily fit a # rack and all your # paraphernalia , for when you 're not studying hard
i bought this item for my son he is a high schoolers he can carry all the schoolbooks , stuff , and stuff without worrying about breaking the backpack he also likes the color he said the blue is better than he thought
i purchased this pack for both daily carry to and from the office , as well as for some upcoming international travel one of the important features i was looking for in a pack was a sternum strap , which this pack obviously has i 've had opportunity to carry this pack fully loaded for almost an entire day and it is very comfortable it 's well padded on the back and the shoulder straps the carry handle on the top is very well placed to allow easy and comfortable carry that way even while loaded the flexibility of the pack has surpassed my expectations there are pouches and pockets for everything i need to carry i was happily surprised to find that my nexus # fits perfectly in the mesh pouch in the main section i love that the main section does n't zipper to fold all the way open - it lets you access everything without the pack falling open the very front pouch on it perfectly holds all the little stuff that i need whenever i 'm on the road or on-site at a client
& # # ; this item was exactly as described by the seller it arrived very quickly , and was packaged well my son use it for school , camping traveling and he is so happy with the size the color and it has space for everything i would definitely buy this
my teenage son has worn out several backpacks in his school days , but this one is holding up well it 's sturdy , roomy , has lots of places to stow things , and looks & # # ; normal & # # ; enough that he does n't feel like he stands out if this one wears out , we 'll be back for a # nd one
this notebook backpack is exactly what you would want for any situation it has room for going backpacking or if you work in the it industry like i do it has room for everything you need i would buy more of these if needed
i 'm in love with this backpack i use it mainly to bring a change of clothes with me to work , and to store a few notebooks i 'm definitely not <unk> the capabilities of this thing , but it suits me perfectly i 'm a sucker for bunches of compartments and this pack handles that admirably everything fits well , and i can store another set of shoes in the open air pouch on the front no problem it 's incredibly sturdy and the ability to have it stand up on its own is great i have n't used it to store a laptop yet so i ca n't comment in that regard it is a heavier pack , but once you get it on your back the padding makes it feel much lighter than it is
i received it quickly and the price is very good same quality as other bags for twice the price and very roomy i am a law student and carry a laptop and several large textbooks on a daily basis this bag not only holds a lot , but is comfortable on your shoulders and back it also has plenty of compartments for storing writing utensils , flash drives , wallets , phone , and chargers i highly recommend this bag -lrb- especially for students on a budget -rrb-
this is the best backpack i have even owned i love the open pocket it the front it is very comfortable even when full mine is starting to wear out -lrb- after # years of use and abuse -rrb- and i intend to replace it with the same model it has plenty of space for my textbooks and gadgets even with my laptop in it it works for well for my # `` inch <unk>
great quality backpack i 've never had a swiss gear before , but the material that goes into this bag is certainly better than anything you 'll find in a retail store fits my # . # inch laptop in the # rd pocket down -lrb- wow -rrb- it 's also super comfortable to have on the only thing is that when it 's slightly bulkier than most backpacks people carry around my university campus
love all these little compartments for cables , keys , phones , laptop , and other necessary items for travel i use this exclusively for when i need to carry my work laptop across the country on flights and in airports there is a little zippered pouch at the top of the bag where i put my phones -lrb- work and personal -rrb- as well as keys i love that the important items are easy to have stowed away in a secure place i also use the open pouch clasps to hold my jacket when i need to travel without having to stuff it in my suitcase or backpack i wish this bag came in more feminine colors and options , but i do n't ever see me being without this bag or one exactly like it
either in blue or red this is an excellent backpack . so much room for # inch computer plus lots of extras . easy to over pack by weight because it holds so much
this backpack was bought for gear storage when the recipient was riding their motorcycle the straps and zippers are top-notch and it sits comfortably has not yet been used for laptop storage , doubt it will in the future , however , if needed to , there is plenty of space
exactly what we were looking for as a present for our granddaughter who will be taking a trip to europe this summer better than another brand we had bought for $ # more
this laptop is perfect for fitting everything for college i can fit all my books , dell # . # `` laptop , ac charger , <unk> , and all accesories also , it is very comfortable with <unk> padding allowing airflow between the pack and your back the laptop is very well protected in its suspended pocket the backpack has also done a surprisingly good job of keeping the rain out perfect , with room for more
i 've been using this backpack for # years i like the built in protection for my computer lots of useful pockets and organizer type pockets i use this everyday , but there 's no noticeable signs of wear very sturdy and <unk> constructed
i looked for quite some time for just the right backpack for my son i love swiss gear products and decided on this one , hoping it was right it is an amazing backback much more roomy than others we have , but still easily sits on the back of my # year old now , all four of my boys are begging for a backpack like this one you will love this backpack
i purchased this backpack for my son who is in high school the backpack is deeper than most so you do n't have to cram things in it if you take a close look at the picture associated with the backpack you 'll see two straps with clips there are also two straps and clips on each side this is one of my favorite features ... you can use the straps with clips to support the compartments and prevent <unk> , to hang a lunch <unk> , hang <unk> shoes , etc . i would definitely purchase this backpack again
less than daily use , but more than weekly this was my way to carry my <unk> / change of clothes it was still as good as new four years later i gave it to a friend and was happy to find this same model on amazon so i bought it great zippers , thats important open middle pouch is perfect for your bible , easy access seriously , still like brand new after four years of regular use except for the elastic on the two side water bottle nets
this is my second maxxum swiss gear backpack years ago i bought this same backpack except it was red in color i absolutely loved it i ride my bike everywhere and this backpack has a convenient pouch which i use to put my <unk> it it has a padded compartment for my laptop and , in addition to the main pouch , it has numerous other pouches which come in handy this is a very durable backpack with comfortable straps you 'll never regret purchasing it
this backpack was exactly what i needed it has a ton of space and really supports your back well i 'm using in school and can finally carry all my books and computer without killing my shoulders it is really comfy and sturdy
i picked this pack up a few months ago originally i was going to get a different pack from this manufacturer , the ` <unk> ' , but found that it did n't fit my # . # `` laptop fortunately this one did it has more than enough room to hold all the things i carry on a regular basis the pouch in front is especially useful for giving me quick access to my most frequently used items it 's ridged enough to protect my investment , while at the same time provides a good level of comfort while worn and of course it certainly feels sturdy enough to take several years of abuse
this backpack is amazing my boyfriend has the red and i have the blue they are sturdy , hold everything we need for class , work , and light travel needs lots of pockets nice to look at not hard on my back and i 'm really petite heavy duty enough for him and he 's big and carries all type of equipment and books we love our backpacks
as many people have pointed out , it is very hard to find a feminine bad for a # `` laptop i was very hopeful about this bag and took it on a business trip with my lasting # days in july there is a vinyl covering on the inside seam of the handle that has come loose and is starting to peel away from the leather handle i do n't see any way to repair this without just peeling this covering off i would have given the bag one start but this is really the only issue
<unk> <unk> # `` nb <unk> was quite a feat to find a computer bag for my new hp pavilion # `` notebook that had some feminine flare this bag is fashionable and functionable i did buy a neoprene sleeve for extra padding and waterproofing the bag is a tight fit with the computer cord included ; thus not allowing for too much extra materials - perhaps a few key files and notepad i love the look of this bag - conservative , yet feminine
this bag should hold any # `` laptop out there bought it for my wife to hold laptop and other <unk> and she loves it it has the appearance of a professional ladies bag
a feminine laptop bag that supports a # . # `` screen laptop i have <unk> searched for a feminine bag that fits the # . # `` screen and this is the one although there is plenty of room for the laptop , i think there could be more to support additional files and folders the description states <unk> , but beige is not an accurate description it is a <unk> bag overall , good purchase and pleased that the search for a nice feminine laptop bag is over
great size and well made product fits computer , power cords , external mouse , plus room for lots more i really like that it stands up and does not tip over , when holding the laptop very well made product
i got this for my daughter 's macbook the fit is very tight and the bag feels as though it is stretching to the breaking point the pocket seems feel very flimsy , only time will tell if they will hold up i have several brenthaven bags of varying prices and quality and they all feel sturdier than this one <unk> update august # after almost a year this bag is still holding up well it still feels ` cheap ' but overall i 'd say its a good value
good case - i bought it for the macbook air - it fits nicely inside - the case is pretty light and their is a good amount of storage for stuff like extra plug , mighty mouse ,
i love this laptop case i first saw it at <unk> and figured i 'd find it in the us for a lower price , but no luck with that it 's a pretty expensive case when compared to others of similar material , i suppose due to what seems to be a lack of competing products with this quality and size it was worth every <unk> though to have a nice compact case that is lightweight and just the right size for my laptop in addition to my laptop i carry the power adapter and a wireless mouse i can fit my ipod and a few odd bits in the front , along with business cards and i can squeeze a magazine or small paperback in the slide pocket on the back i have to be careful with shoulder strain and this is wonderful for that i can carry it comfortably by the handles , on the shoulder or over the shoulder the shoulder pad is nicely designed too
this case was exactly what i was looking for the price is right , the quality is superb , and it looks good too the only thing i would change would be to <unk> the side flap
i just recently bought the new apple # `` macbook and needed a laptop case for it i absolutely love the case it has a pocket on one side with a place to hold cds and two smaller pockets on the other side which are perfect for keeping memory cards and the like it fits the laptop charger very nice as well the strap is detachable and very comfortable on the shoulder the case is perfect for putting it in a backpack with other school supplies or having just the case to take the laptop around it also has handles on the top overall , very sturdy and a great product
i was a bit disappointed with this case the case i have that came free with another portable dvd player we purchased several years ago has much more padding i feel like if my player were dropped while in this case , there would n't be much protection for it also , there is no pocket that works for the cables we just have to cram them in with the dvd player , which makes it oddly misshapen and hard to zip closed i would not purchase this case again
i give this product # stars because i 'm not really happy with it the only acceptable feature is the disc pocket other than that , you ca n't find a well fitted roomy slot to store all the cables one side is the disc pocket , the other side is a flat pocket with no flap covering the open , which is open for water to get in easily i have the panasonic # . # `` , this case does n't fit nicely as i wanted
for as expensive as seemingly nothing but a small bag , i 'd expect a little more the side pockets make it bulgy when you actually use them to store video cables or anything else it should be more padded or at least have bigger outer pockets it works , but is overpriced for what it offers then again , all carry cases are overpriced
good case , durable the only issue i have with it is the storage space it has only one little pocket inside i have a # `` player so i just pack the cords around it
i bought the case and a # `` phillips pet # dvd player prior to a vacation where we drove # miles <unk> to <unk> the kids since our <unk> <unk> does not have a built-in entertainment system the case was used for storing the player when the player was not in use and for transporting it in and out of the car and the cabin for this use , it is very good and our player fits very nicely without too tight or too sloppy a fit in addition , it has a <unk> headphone splitter so both kids can hear the movie while mom & dad hear <unk> however , the case has very little storage so only six or eight discs minus the cases or protective sleeves can be stored in the <unk> holder the charger cable 's plug had to be shoved down into the storage that insufficient to accomodate it and this left a sizeable lump on the back side of the case which prevented it from sitting flat since it was one of the less expensive models i looked at , i guess we got the value for which we paid $ # . # it was and is worth the money
i bought two of these bags one for a christmas gift and one for my own dvd player the one used as a gift , was well liked by the gift recipient , however i barely could zip up mine when my player was put into the bag i have a # `` toshiba which is a little wider then the panasonic # `` the unit the other bag was purchased for i had to return mine , but again the panasonic dvd is fine in the other bag the bag was very well made and looked very good , but i caution you to beware of the size as well as no storage room for accessaries , comes with a nice disc case if your looking to carry your accessaries along with you this is not the right bag
i bought this case logic shuttle for my # `` inch phillips portable dvd player the player fits great and it has a cool dvd holder which fits securely in a front pouch so you can bring dvds with you without <unk> around their hard cases or another pouch it also comes with a built in headphone splitter so two people can listen if your dvd player only has one jack built in my only complaint is that there is no real <unk> place for me to store the dvd player 's charger and <unk> power adapter i found a way to store them at the seam of the case but another small pocket somewhere would have been nice and made this case absolutely perfect
this is a good case with plenty of room for larger portable players i was a little disappointed that there is no strap to hold the player in the case nor inner pocket -lrb- s -rrb- for accessories , but this is otherwise a good choice for larger players
my mother travels often and i purchased this carry case for her # inch screen portable dvd player it 's light weight and easily stores in luggage , backpack , etc . or just carry by the handles not too thick and bulky , but holds <unk> you need
i purchased this bag mainly because it was one of the recommended items to buy with my viewsonic pj # <unk> projector despite amazon 's recommendation , the bag does n't fit the projector double check the size of your projector before you purchase this
i purchased this for a laptop projector for my professional society it gets a lot of use and has held up admirably i would recommend this bag to anyone our organization 's laptop and projector are used by many different people , so we needed a sturdy bag everyone has commented on the construction of this
the case was made really well , good quality it was smaller than i expected but my projector does fit in it do n't let the picture fool you ; unless you have a tiny projector the projector will take up the <unk> case however there is an exterior pocket that is large enough for the cords
case is extremely well made ; however , it is not generous in room for the projector that i purchased striking a balance between being compact and being too small is a challenge ... but i would have prefered a little more room for power and video cables that being said , if you have a fairly compact projector and are looking for a case which is well made and well padded ... this may be a good choice for you
very nice design and quality but a little small for my device really nice storage case for the viewsonic pj # d # <unk> dlp <unk> projector even though it 's a little small the zippers close fairly tight if you have just the projector in the case and nothing else i place the power cord and remote in the case after i zipper it closed i 've decided to keep it <unk> because of the value and the fact that i just needed it for storage and transporting protection from the elements it 's also nice because the projector does n't slide or move around when you carry it in the case i recommend it for smaller <unk> only or if you do n't mind it being a tight fit for your projector or small device
i got this product for my dlp <unk> projector , but does n't fit in it you should check if this dimensions work for your equipment projector compartment # . # `` x # . # `` x # `` -lrb- # . # x # . # x # . # cm
i just ordered this bag , and today have just received it my viewsonic which i just received , but have n't used yet , but fits well , is dimensions <unk> - # . # `` x # . # `` x # . # `` the zipper lid makes the case a half inch plus -lrb- # `` -rrb- flexible , as is stated projector compartment # . # `` x # . # `` x # `` -lrb- # . # x # . # x # . # cm i have the viewsonic pj # d # <unk> dlp <unk> <unk> is a big front compartment it seems very solid and i expect it to last
well constructed bag and serves the purpose the issue i have is excessive room inside the bag and computer can move around more than i would like the adjustable insert has to be removed for a # inch computer to fit i have taken the mesh cord storage bag , with the cord in it , and placed it at the bottom edge of the case with the removable insert between the computer and the cord bag i did use the bag on as carry on and it was perfect i carried school books and snacks in the bag along with the new laptop
this is a top grade case and the fit and finish is first rate my wife likes the bag , however , it really is larger than i ever dreamed it was i guess that 's the down side of ordering on line ... you just cant ' kick the tires ! ! the bag is great if you want to take your folding umbrella , a bunch of files , and a couple of books or makeup or whatever it 's got that much room nice bag , though in fairness , her new computer is quite a bit smaller than the one she was using
the case was as described and was pretty much what i was looking for the internal separator is worthless with a # `` laptop , but with a smaller laptop it would be very useful the charger will still fit into the compartment with the <unk> all other aspects seem to be fine i am satisfied with my
the case is very nice with strong structured sides to protect your computer the only problem i have is , it is made to fit a # `` computer , but it has to fit long ways and than you do n't have the velcro band to hold your energy supply in place you have to remove that band and have no other place to attach the velco to hold the energy supply securely
it is a cheap laptop case but a good one seems to have plenty of padding and to be durable it even has some structure to the sides of the case to actually protect the computer -lrb- most cheap cases are pure soft sided cases which protect it about as well as a burlap sack .
mom and dad showed up from michigan for their spring break in sc with the laptop wrapped up in a piece of foam so i ordered this for them as a present i 'm not at all surprised that i got another targus product that is well designed and a good value for what it is intended for if your a road warrior crashing around between airports , you are probably going to look for something a little sturdier but if your just a sometime traveler looking for a decent bag that 's not going to break the bank , this could be your pick
was concerned that a bag for # `` screen would be too big for my # . # `` laptop but the extra space proved to be helpful in storing power cord , mouse etc . there are adjustable inserts to make a snug fit ... and there is a velco strap <unk> fit the laptop so it does n't move around fittings , zippers , etc are of good quality overall , satisfied with purchase
this is a very well made product that fits everything needed for traveling with my laptop it has several compartments for extras , like the powercord , mouse , disks , zune powercord , also plenty of room to put your cell phone and other items from your pocket when going through airport security
this is my second targus laptop bag , and i like it alot the strap has been improved from the last bag this strap has a <unk> shoulder pad , so you do not have to worry about it sliding down off your shoulder and needing to constantly adjust it there are a good number of pockets , although the zipper on the inside front of the bag is in a strange location in my opinion the bag itself has a nice , professional appearance , and it appears to be solidly constructed with strong stitching nicely padded , and the side of the bag that rubs against the body has a nice mesh which allows it to breathe and not get you too sweaty this bag has meet my needs nicely
there is a velcro divider that i needed to remove to squeeze in my qosmio # . # `` laptop it is a tight squeeze and not really any padding on the sides that being said , the bag is sturdy and the laptop compartment is in the middle of the bag so the structure itself will provide some protection the bag seems well constructed and durable but it is a bit bulky for my needs it has a compartment for clothing , similar to an overnight bag i could have done without that because i was really just looking for a wheeled computer bag to haul around this large laptop i settled for this one <unk> a bag for a laptop this size is almost impossible to find i do n't anticipate my computer spending much time in the bag anyway so i may come to appreciate the extra space while traveling
i bought this bag for my toshiba satellite p # -s # . # & # # ; when i was just planning to buy it , i 'm really so hesitant due to some negative <unk> i 've read but i really need one so i decided to order from amazon oh boy , it 's really nice i love it
i was trying to find a case for my first laptop that i had just bought looked at two or three different stores , ended up coming to amazon and bought this one it is more than i expected a great buy
i had a targus for my # `` dell this is just as good and protects as well as my first i would n't buy any thing else since i know these work
i forgot for how many years i 've own this case , maybe # or # , just discovered that i never reviewed it still looks like new , still does the job well and i had at least # years of intense <unk> . business travel with it lots of room for all your modern needs , you can put a laptop , a projector , and quite a number of other small devices on it the padding is also very good and protective to your electronic goods
