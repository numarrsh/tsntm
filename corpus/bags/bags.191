i have been using samsonite <unk> series for past a year -lrb- less than # year -rrb- for everyday work , and it was time to replace because it began falling apart -lrb- watch some of reviews of samsonite backpacks where tear may start after months of use this bag i have just used for about a week so i ca n't say anything about its longevity , but from the first look - it looks sturdy enough to last more than a year easily one thing i really like about this bag is that it has some hard back support backpacks are now designed to fit laptop on the very back slot particularly with samsonite backpack i had , i did not really find it comfortable to carry the backpack with mbp # inch because i could feel the laptop on my back samsonite backpack did have cushion for the bag , but i thought it was not strong enough with some weights this one however has some sort of hard plastic shell on the back which , <unk> prevents my back from feeling the heat & <unk> of laptop given the price -lrb- $ # ~ -rrb- , i would say this is a really good deal - you do not have much to loose
bought for teenage son for his laptop that he uses to play games on he was so excited and put everything in it right away it fits the laptop , gaming headphones , and whatever else it is he uses he likes to be organized and this worked out great he thought the look and the quality was very good
shipping : this bag arrived in # days of ordering even on standard shipping speed product : lots of compartments to store things , material feels sturdy -lrb- rest time will tell -rrb- , zippers are smooth , space for a laptop and # thick books , looks also elegant and not gaudy
the built in computer sleeve is super helpful and i feel confident that i can set my bag down without worrying about my computer inside i like to keep things separate and organized and all the pockets of different sizes are great for that this is the second one i bought actually , not because the first one broke , but because my sister liked it so much that she took it for her summer long traveling internship great product at a great price
i am very impressed with this backpack it holds my laptop and ipad very securely i have even overloaded it with as many as # laptops and it has held up very well
this backpack is great well made and looks good i wish the front pocket was made a little more user friendly but still give it a # star you just can beat the price and quality
i love my backpack , my new laptop fits perfectly in the computer slot and i have often doubled the use of the bag as a overnight bag the bag is very comfortable to wear , the padding on the back and on the straps made it easy and fun to wear as i have a bad back i needed something that helped keep pressure off of it and was <unk> weighed down when filled and this backpack fulfilled that wish ! : -rrb- i highly recommend this backpack
this is a great basic backpack it holds at # inch lap top -lrb- in a sleeve -rrb- with enough other pockets for most any other accessory i 'd need with my laptop construction is good can not wait to take it on my first field trip
worked great ... very well organized , plenty of room for all your extras i used this on my last trip ... airport friendly love the sturdy handle , bottom as well as stiff back all in which made it extremely easy to retrieve and return items to the backpack without having it collapse or flop ... which made it smooth sailing when going through security the backpack was easy to carry by hand or on your back the straps are nice , sturdy and stay were you put them i had my laptop and kindle with accessories , couple magazines , purse , small pillow and snacks this is perfect size and was easily stowed under the plane seat it was easy to retrieve everything needed while in the confined airplane seat it was equally as easy to put everything back in its proper place and remain organized and be on my way
fits my # . # & # # ; dell just fine along with lots of items has nice pocket for the mouse i carry several books and notebooks and portfolios and pens markers etc . only complaint is it gets heavy i need to learn to edit the garbage i carry
this brand never disappoints <unk> is a very sturdy and comfortable backpack . hold much weight . and is of great quality , not much dirt it note the interior is spacious and well kept and the steel belt looks good
bought this backpack for my toshiba # . # laptop after reading some good reviews and yes . . this back pack is the best value for money you can get ... honestly believe it is under priced for its quality
love this new backpack my last backpack tore to pieces so i got this one based on the reviews and was not disappointed in the largest pouch , i easily fit my # . # & # # ; laptop with room to spare in the middle zippered pouch , i fit two very large textbooks -lrb- # pages combined -rrb- , a large spiral notebook , two spiral lab workbooks , and a small book here or there then in the small pouch i have two large calculators , a remote , and multiple batteries and pens this does n't quite fill up the backpack it makes it very heavy but the weight distribution is great and the quality of this backpack has felt much sturdier than past backpacks under this kind of load unbeatable for the price i have n't tried the more expensive swiss backpacks , but i do n't need to with this one
i bought this bag because i needed to get a bag with sufficient support and that could fit my laptop comfortably -lrb- # . # inches -rrb- i was able to put my laptop in its sleeve -lrb- <unk> -rrb- and still fit it into the laptop pocket nicely i like the shoulder straps and it does wonders for taking the load off of my back this bag is extremely roomy and fits all of my books it has # water bottle holders on each side of the bag , a special ipod and headphone pocket hole , and is very sturdy i would think a bag like this would cost at least $ # -lrb- i bought it for $ # -rrb- i am thinking of buying another for my cousin in high school -lrb- he has to lug around a ton of textbooks and this would be great for him -rrb- your back will thank you if you get this bag
i bought this backpack for my second semester of college after one unbearable semester of not having one i needed one to carry a few books , notebooks , assorted items , and - most importantly - my laptop there is a partition inside the main space for a laptop it is cushioned , though it could use a bit more on the bottom of the bag the back is patterned with raised & # # ; feet & # # ; to absorb impact , i assume there are plenty of other compartments and spaces in the bag for school supplies , etc . the stitching and the zippers seem to be very well-made and show no signs of tearing or wearing out this backpack is also one of the <unk> ones i 've found with its muted gray and black color scheme and lack of unnecessary frills overall , this is a terrific backpack that appears well-constructed
this backpack is simply awesome for the price , design , color , space , and durability i had looked up # 's of backpacks and at least a dozen websites before i decided to buy rosewill i 'm so glad i did
this is a great <unk> case which is every bit as good if not better than other brands costing # x to # x or more i have used it every day for my daily office commute and for traveling ... outstanding quality my new # inch retina macbook pro fits perfectly
i bought this because my laptop bag was not handling both my laptop and a textbook very well i also wanted to get something that i could use as a & # # ; personal item & # # ; to shove under a seat for airline travel i have to say , despite the reviews i was skeptical about how good this backpack would be it has absolutely lived up to the # -star reviews i love this thing the material feels high-quality and durable , the top handle has a steel wire reinforcement , the back straps are very thick and well-padded , and there is ample space and numerous pockets for stashing various things this is a steal at this price i 'm sure there 's better backpacks out there , but for the money i am absolutely impressed and satisfied with this and i ca n't think of anything more i 'd need out of a backpack
this is a great roomy backpack for all your needs the laptop compartment is well padded this backpack has many pockets for everything you want to carry the ventilated back is great on hot days and reduces sweat on the back best back pack i have owned to date , i use it every day with a laptop and books and it still going strong , with no signs of
this thing is great and it fits my hp pavilion dv # perfectly it has one large compartment for the laptop , another completely separate zippered large compartment for books , a medium compartment i use for my mouse and charger , and a smaller compartment in the front for pencils and stuff it also has # small compartments on both sides of the pack , and mesh water bottle holders on each side as well the bottom side compartments are a good size for storing small things , but the two top side compartments are really small and can only hold something like a # <unk> energy bottles there 's also a removable cellphone pouch on the shoulder right shoulder strap that fits a iphone # or # perfectly -lrb- i do n't think it will fit the samsung galaxy -rrb- the only thing its does n't have is that strap that goes across your chest
i shopped around quite a bit before getting this the stuff at best buy is way to expensive given the quality , but this product is just right i lug this around almost daily and it keeps my mac and ipad in perfect shape , and looks good to boot i 'd recommend this backpack
it is a little on the heavy but was precisely what i needed i now have room for all of my things , everything is really nicely padded : the straps , the inside where the laptop goes , and even the small pouch inside that can hold an ipod the zippers are really fluid and the mesh pockets for water bottles is of a really nice fabric honestly , for the price i was n't expecting the best but it 's nicer then a lot of $ # and up backpacks i 've seen get one while you can
well constructed has storage for everything books , mouse , power cord , lunch , whatever almost too many places to store things that they get lost holds the laptop firmly and is well protected only problem i have had is i tend to take too many things with me now and it gets a bit heavy
i got it for my # th grader she takes care of her things and sometimes needs t <unk> up to # texts books in her backpack the order came pretty quick , and <unk> looked very nice before she started using it front seems came off in couple of weeks handle seems way too light weight over all - poor quality
in two weeks of use by my # grader -lrb- and she takes care of her belongings very <unk> -rrb- all the front seems ripped and the backpack became impossible to use
i ordered the red rolling backpack and then changed my mind i cancelled the order and received an email stating that the order was cancelled in a few days the backpack came and i decided to keep it because i did n't want to go through the trouble of sending it back my daughter loved it and used it for <unk> # weeks before the zipper broke so frustrated wish i would have returned it
after only # week , the seams on the front pocket started to tear it 's a shame my only hope is that it will last a couple of months before school is out
first of all , i want to say that the shipping was fantastic : i received it in less than # hours great , thank you about the quality of the product - large - great fabric - sturdy - comfy handle , easy to pull and push - not expensive for what you <unk> cons yet i totally recommend it
the minute i turned it on , i noticed a few dead <unk> , but i decided to ignore them i noticed all the <unk> and it took a while to remove it i noticed how slow and <unk> it was , but thought that would improve as i got things set up i was n't able to install a very simple <unk> program , but that was the fault of the insufficient screen resolution the keys felt weird and sticky : the minute i touched the lid , my fingerprints seemed permanently <unk> on the slick surface but none of this was enough to really put me off but before the first charge on the battery had run down , it started giving me the dreaded blue screen -- then the <unk> died my replacement will be a toshiba
i purchased two of these for use in travel one of the netbooks has an issue with the keys sticking , and one of the shift key does not work on both unit , they just turn off for no reason , losing everything you have if it was on just one of the units , i would have thought it a manufacturing error , but for both , it has to be a poor design in general normally hp units have been pretty good , but after this i really have to <unk> i 'm throwing both away and get something i know works well -lrb- like a mac air
from the get go this netbook <unk> at a <unk> 's pace my five year old <unk> pc was operating quicker i sent it in to hp multiple times for repair and it still never worked properly it 's sitting in my cabinet doing nothing for the past year overall i am totally unsatisfied with this purchase - for $ # get a regular pc
the size is nice , great for travel , unfortunately i got stuck with one which has a <unk> functioning space bar it doesnt put a space in unless you really <unk> on it this is unbelievably irritating when writing emails , one of the reasons i bought the thing in the first place it probably had been returned from a customer before and was sent out again -lrb- maybe <unk> -rrb- the screen has scuffed up something horrible i needed a computer and didnt send it back when i should have <unk> the quality control on amazon
worked well for a few months , but now i 'm always having problems with this , freezes and is n't a reliable laptop at all i 've always had virus protection and clean up the computer frequently to avoid issues but still gives me issues with daily . use
the screen on this computer is too small and i have a hard time scrolling throughout it is a bit heavier too compared to similar acer product i had to return it and pay the return shipping , which is fine amazon.com was really nice to handle the return i bought an acer instead and it was a lot lighter to carry around , and the screen also a bit bigger . # & # # ; is simply too small for me to read
i bought this to replace another that died from a virus i like the size and shape but have problems with the key board with the e not working or to many letters showing with one touch of the key other then that i like the computer just my fault for not sending it back to fix the key board
big problem with the space bar you have to hit it twice to get it to move as it tends to stick this can be tedious when trying to type and having to go back in to put in spaces otherwise . . product is good
this computer is just as great as any other hp i 've ever had , but the processor is very slow in this day and age , it 's unexpected to have to wait a minute or more for a program to load , but since the day i turned the computer on , that 's been my experience it 's also a little disappointing that it only comes with a starter version of windows # - not the full version i had n't heard of windows starter before so i was n't sure what it meant , but i had to spend another $ # to buy the full version for the money , i would say buy a full sized laptop instead with a faster processor
i bought this hp mini # because of it 's portability i have a # `` which is too heavy to carry so i decided to get one of this i travel a lot and having this mini with me instead of my # `` really makes a huge difference i changed the ram to # gb -lrb- crucial <unk> # bc # gb # <unk> pc # <unk> ddr # memory module -rrb- and it 's fast enough for my use
i used this laptop mainly during my travels , from surfing the internet at wifi spots to storing my photos from my digital camera unfortunately after a # year and # months of ownership , i received the dreaded hard disk full -lrb- # -rrb- error which meant that the hard drive failed other than this hardware failure , i quite enjoyed using this most basic of laptop
i realized i needed more than my tablet while away from home for extended periods this fit the bill quite nicely i did purchase upgrades independent of this purchase i got the # gb of memory and the full windows # home edition i also bought a mini mouse all in all i am very satisfied
i purchased this for my wife and she loves it it is small but the key board feels full size and the screen size is ample my wife uses it to write and read books on the train as she commutes at # pounds it is the perfect litle package for computing while commuting
this is my first netbook and it 's <unk> -- for its size and lightness , sturdy built , handsome design and great performance -- fast and to top it all is long , incredibly long battery life with this wonderful little machine whose price just too good to be true ; it even looks expensive well , so far so good -- hp , thanks
i bought this for my son before i deployed to korea for a year so we can skype together it has been a supreme machine i ditched all the software it came with and upgraded for free to the new windows and added office for free and it still runs like a champ so he can use it for school as well best gift i ever bought
i bought this netbook specifically for its small size and ease of portability it is as described , and i am very satisfied with the product be aware of the small hard drive before buying if you want to do more than surf the web and send emails and documents
when i first saw this product review i was a bit skeptical it took a while before i made up my mind to go for it it took just # days for it to arrive at my <unk> and luckily again i was home to personally receive it as soon as i unpacked it , i was amazed at the ` little wonder ' the set up did n't take up to # mins from start to finish it 's incredible i 'm sending back my # inch dell inspiron cos it 's damn too slow compared to my mini hp its a fantastic companion for personal use and travel go for it , i bet you wo n't regret it
<unk> <unk> <unk> from recycled <unk> dedicated laptop <unk> -lrb- no real protection for your mac , need a separate sleeve if you want impact protection velcro on inside of flap has ripped open both mesh pockets -lrb- this is a design flaw , perhaps it 's been fixed in last year ? it 's a bit
this bag is not bad , but a little more simple than i thought it would be to me , it looked a little more high end in the pictures but in person it looks slightly cheap i do n't necessarily think the product is worth the price , but it is definitely good to use as an everyday messenger bag that may be subjected to a little abuse
reading other feedback , i ca n't figure out how we could have received the same item my # & # # ; macbook air can barely be squeezed into this sleeve and i ca n't zip the case when it is inside maybe i was shipped the wrong item -- i 'll be returning it today
i ordered because the description states it is for a `` macbook pro `` but i received the case and it was for a macbook air unclear product description and very misleading please fix that
the case is falsely advertised to fit a macbook air # inch there is almost a whole inch still sticking outside of the case and there is zero chance of being able to zip it closed i will be returning this immediately
i wish i had read the customer reviews before ordering this product , but who could believe that incase would sell something that does n't even fit ? i chose this based on looks , and from what i can tell this would work well with an # `` macbook air , but i ordered the # `` size ! looks like i will be returning this and go another week unprotected one star for <unk>
review update : aaa bargains contacted me and informed me that there had been a big issue with incase and this product that had been provided to them the representative that called me was very apologetic and my refund was processed in a timely matter i would definitely buy from this seller again , i would just <unk> aaa bargains to test their products before selling and not trusting the manufacturer 's description the product description and title said that this case would work for my # `` macbook pro when i received the item at home my macbook pro barely fit on the sides and when it touched bottom there was almost an inch of my laptop sticking out of the top advertised incorrectly , product is being returned
the price is high so that i think the quality is good . and picture shows it is nice case . in fact , there are big difference between picture and good . but service is good i got the refund efficiently
i loved the look of this case and the pocket on the case , but the # inch case looked and fit my computer like a # inch case would i was very disappointed that my computer could slide around it looks awesome and everything , but i did n't like how my mac was n't snug
i really like this case it has a nice pocket on the outside for a few extra things the heather look is a nice accent , and better than just a black look i can guess that after years of use it will retain it 's cleaner look for longer than some other cases the case it , however , a little thick when empty it means that the protection is good , but my previous basic incase case was thinner and still protected well the other thing i like a little less about it is that the fit with a macbook pro is still slightly loose the computer can move around a bit , but it 's not a big concern for me
this laptop cover is exactly what i wanted it is durable and well-constructed it looks good , too i feel that my laptop is protected my scratches and bumps when i put it in my backpack full of books with this cover on fits my # & # # ; macbook pro
i used to have a the metro # backpack and was hoping that this would be a replacement however this one is slightly narrower and the pockets may not be as useful as before
a good backpack though not of the same quality as the previous ogio metro i own materials seem less substantial , zippers flimsier and only one <unk> exterior pockets not as large as before still a good unit but ogio took a step backwards and made some obvious cost savings design changes to the metro ii compared to the original metro
very well made , lived up to expectations , material quality - excellent seller was exceptional as well in use now by freshman year college student outstanding room , but not at all bulky and hard to handle
this replaced a ogio metro backpack that withstood daily use for years there was no other choice for me but to purchase another ogio metro and am very pleased and looking forward to another great long-term
very good quality backpack with many pockets . . beautiful and confortable i had just one problem with one <unk> but just push i little bit and it was ok .
the large back compartment easily fits my # & # # ; laptop , it feels well cushioned and it seems to be constructed so that bulky things do n't push onto the screen of the laptop i find it comfortable to wear and it has room for tons fo stuff when i travel i use it as my only carry
every pocket has a purpose and is very useful not just there to be there it also fits well in the overhead in an airplane i really like the soft interior for electronics
this is a pretty good backpack it 's sturdy , nice looking and has lots of pockets the backpack itself is roomy enough to hold more than just a laptop so it is well suited for students as well another plus is that it 's nicely padded in all the right areas for both your laptop 's protection and also for your shoulders
i like this thing you get a really nice backpack for the price and it can hold quite a bit including a laptop i put my wives # inch netbook and then put my sons # inch dell inside of it after i took the netbook out and both were <unk> up by the compartment lots of room which is nice it can hold a lot of other stuff as well the neat thing on it is there is a jack on the outside of the pack that you can plug your headphones into and have your mp # player on the inside hooked up playing music it is solid construction and all in all i really like it
i needed this for short trip <unk> to work , and it fills the bill quite nicely i love the multiple pockets , finally a place for everything the water bottle pockets are a nice touch too , especially for those hot days the construction is typical of targus , well stitched and durable it 's nicely padded and wears well , even when loaded down , which is easy to do with all the storage room it 's snazzy looking , not too flashy ... it looks more expensive than it is i have n't used the headphone jack feature so i ca n't vouch for it 's utility , but it 's a nice touch give this one serious consideration
i got this to carry my tablet and occasionally my laptop to and from class my favorite thing about it is that it 's low profile and does n't have very much unnecessary bulk like other bags do sometimes it fits as a carry on on a plane too , and is convenient for backpacking on weekend trips
the attache is very basic and does not have very much padding i am considering returning it because it is not what i envisioned on the plus side , though , it is quite light weight
you can put the laptop and mouse in , but no room for cords or mouse pad another half inch from side to side would make it easier to put the laptop in
the case logic # . # -inch laptop attache suits my needs perfectly well it is not terribly roomy , but it holds my basic computer needs it seems to be robust and will probably last as long as the computer does
if you 're looking for a decent quality basic carrying case for a laptop , this is a good option it does n't have a lot of pockets and i would n't use this for my professional job that requires multiple storage options and a durable case
this was an impulse purchase it turns out i bought a strong lightweight attache that holds my laptop and some attachments it would have been better if it had more room for the superdrive and cords , but just to carry the computer it 's perfect
does n't have a huge amount of storage , but it does the job not a lot of room for a spare ethernet cable the power cable fits in the case and that 's about it the price is right and it protects the laptop
good case , but feels cheap wish we had spent a bit more and gotten a nicer case , not as professional as we had expected not very good protection to protect your laptop from damage during travel
the laptop case came just like it was described perfect fit for my asus laptop and plenty of space for the power cord and other stuff as well the clips to the <unk> strap are plastic , though ; i can see them breaking with constant use but i do n't see myself wearing out my case in that way
bought this with a toshiba laptop while the laptop fits well , it would use another compartment or two still , we were looking for an inexpensive bag and this fit the bill cushioning is ok but not what i would consider excellent for an economy bag i think the price point was right - and for the price your not going to get everything you 'd expect in a $ # bag a good basic laptop bag overall if you 're not looking for anything fancy
my # . # toshiba fits it perfectly , not tight , but no room to flop around the side pouch holds the charger , and my logitech m # trackball mouse , which is a bit thick my only gripe would be that the pockets in the side pouch are only a couple inches deep , nothing really stays in the without falling out maybe a flashdrive or small card folio , but they 're too small for anything else it 's good for me , but if you have a lot of stuff , i 'd go with something bigger
got this for my mom who wanted a basic case for her laptop it fit well and had some room in the front for the cords i would n't stuff it too much - like i do mine - but it fits her needs well and had decent padding
i bought this in conjuction with a sleeve for my # . # & # # ; laptop works well and keeps my expensive laptop away from my <unk> of a son could n't ask for much more only complaint is the shoulder strap is a bit flimsy
this bag is just what i was looking for thin but big enough to hold just what i would need i really like the separator in the middle section of the bag - one zipper , but with a place for the laptop and a place for some papers
was out getting a new laptop and saw this same bag at best buy for triple the price i have greatly enjoyed this bag and what a great price thank you amazon , after my laptop purchase i appreciate your price
this laptop case was exactly as described it works well for my purposes and holds lots of extras i like the fact that it is light weight but also seems to have enough padding
this is a straight forward laptop bag made of good materials case logic is meant to me used day in and out however not much additional storage spaces available laptop and one pocket still very effective if you are just taking your laptop , charger and a few other items
this laptop case was exactly what i needed it has enough room to fit a book or the laptop cord into the case , but the case is n't bulky or heavy i love it , and the vendor provided great service
very padded has a little extra room for my laptop which is quite fine for me as i would n't want an exact fit . has extra compartments to store miscellaneous items . very good purchase
i have a laptop carrier that i use but my husband loves this for when we travel and he can use it like a briefcase the different pockets work out perfectly for him
i purchased the bag to us when i needed to travel with my toshiba qosmio laptop i did use this bag # or # times since i received it i noticed this weekend that the laptop compartment zipper was starting to fail and come apart it is useless now because i can no longer <unk> it to stay closed and hold the laptop in
most of the quality is ok as far as durability of the case goes i do not like the plastic <unk> that hold the shoulder strap after # weeks of use , one side just randomly fell through my laptop <unk> down as i grabbed the strap it hit the ground pretty lightly , but still managed to chip the corner of the laptop makes me believe the padding and plastic <unk> should be better quality luckily my new laptop seems ok other the the chip -lrb- i had to snap some plastic back together that <unk> but hardware stress tests lead me to believe the laptop is ok . i 'm probably going to use electrical tape to make sure the straps never come off again , and then i 'll probably replace this case very soon anyway
this case opens from the front making it easy to remove the laptop there is room to spare inside , maybe too much there is little padding inside , and no hard bottom one velcro strap holds the laptop inside there is plenty of room for the accessories , and the handle and strap are secure it 's light weight , and easy to carry , but does n't provide much protection for your investment
i chose this bag because it fit my # & # # ; macbook pro , and a few accessories i liked the look of it , the heft , <unk> <unk> basically , it 's a good bag if you 're not going to use it a whole lot , or walk far with it so , the two problems i have with it are these # -rrb- it 's been about # months since i bought it and already there 's some of the plastic type edges wearing through the material of the bag where it hangs against my leg # -rrb- because the shoulder strap is attached to the bag by two plastic type clasps , the plastic parts rub together and squeak i 'm not <unk> when i say that people from a block away from me have looked around , wondering where that strange creaking noise is coming from i 've managed to <unk> the problem somewhat by taking all the pieces of the clasp apart and wrapping them with cotton / ribbons / <unk> <unk> , but it 's still ridiculous still , it holds my computer i just would n't buy it again , and i 'm currently looking for a bag with metal clasps
while this case logic laptop case will suffice in the task of carrying your laptop , it will not provide any protection against damage i was shocked that this laptop case has no padding or protection for its contents not worth half its cost , better to pay and get peace of mind
if you are worried about whether this case will hold your big # . # incher , rest assured it does my preference was for a case with pockets to hold my myriad of tech trinkets and i did not get that with this case there is velcro strap section for your laptop , a front zip pocket that is pretty big and an inside sleeve ; that 's it the case is also built to hold a rigid rectangle shape , which left a kind of bulgy unattractive look for me my <unk> aside , this case will easily hold a laptop , your ac cord and essentials
but not overly impressed with it padding seems very minimal and laptop seems to slide around a little to easy for light use , i think it will be fine and do the job
the padding for the bag appears to be adequate but the tie down tether in my opinion is flimsy at any rate this was a gift from my wife , who i love , and for the cost it is what it is storage space is lacking
this is a fine , lightweight case for # & # # ; laptops it fits a lenovo g # with room to spare padding is minimal but sufficient i dropped it out of an suv and no damage was done to the laptop front pocket is small but can fit an ac adapter , mouse after a month of use it seems to be losing its shape in summary , its not outstanding , but does the job and the prices was good when i bought it
there is one major issue with the amount of space it provides for my accessories such as a charger , mouse , etc . it only has one front pocket in witch i ca n't even fit my charger this is a huge flaw considering that you need one to actually use the computer more than two days on a positive note , the case provides good protection for the computer itself , and it came with a shoulder strap for easily carrying the case around
it is the right size for my new laptop is made with good materials it would be better if there was more inside pockets to help organize other items that i need to carry and the construction of the inside of the bag does not stand up on its own
the case is great , but my hp envy # & # # ; did n't fit i was very surprised i also was going to return it , but could n't find any instructions then i just forgot
the bag is functional and appears to be durable i received the bag as a gift , and the bag does what it is suppose to there is no bells and whistles with this one i am sure there are other bags in this price range that have more space and pockets for a no nonsense bag this is the one seems kinda light on padding and protection
nice laptop case , but the con is it does n't have any pockets on the inside i bought it for my dad and that was a dealbreaker for him so had to send it back
